    "summary": "<p>On January 25, 2002, several developmentally disabled residents of California filed a lawsuit against the State of California and its Department of Developmental Services in the California Superior Court for the County of Alameda. The lawsuit was filed under California's Lanterman Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701; and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of California residents with developmental disabilities who are institutionalized or at risk of institutionalization, alleging that the state failed to place class members in the least restrictive environment commensurate with their needs, creating unnecessary institutionalization.</p><p>Although the Superior Court (Judge Ronald Sabraw) denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, the California appellate court (Judge Timothy Reardon) reversed the trial court's decision and granted class certification. Capitol People First v. Dep't of Developmental Serv., 2007 WL 2772868 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. Sep. 25, 2007) (No. A113168). The trial court found that there was insufficient commonality of issues, that the representative plaintiffs would not adequately represent the putative class members, and that a class remedy would be less appropriate than individual remedies.</p><p>As to the commonality requirement, the appellate court faulted the trial court for focusing too narrowly on the details of allegations relating to the representative plaintiffs, \"rather than taking a broader, systemic view concentrating on respondents' policies and practices.\" The appellate court found that the trial court's belief that the individualized nature of each plaintiff's individual program plan would unduly restrict the use of statistical proof at trial \"would turn all pattern and practice class litigation upside down.\"</p><p>As to adequacy of representation, the trial court cited an argument made by a group of intervening institutionalized residents who argued that the relief sought by the plaintiffs would result in some people being removed from institutions who desired to remain there. The appellate court rejected this argument, noting that the interveners represented no more than a fraction of the class and that, at any rate, the interveners' argument went to the merits of the case and to \"different philosophical perspectives on the issue of institutionalization,\" as opposed to any \"legally cognizable antagonism.\"</p><p>Lastly, the appellate court found that the individual remedies proposed by the trial court were inadequate. The court reasoned that, before improved assessment and services tailored to the unique needs of individuals may be realized, \"the policies that undergird decisionmaking and allocation of resources must be changed.\"</p><p>On April 24, 2009, the Superior Court (Judge Robert Freedman) approved a settlement agreement reached by the parties. According to a Disability Rights California press release, \"The settlement provides for additional funds for case management to assist class members in state-run institutions called developmental centers (DC); improved information to class members and training for DC staff about community living options; increased state-level coordination of services for people diagnosed with developmental and mental health disabilities; and continued funding and program efforts to provide community living alternatives for class members.\" The settlement was set to remain in effect for three years, during which time Disability Rights California would monitor the state's performance of the settlement terms.</p><p>We have no further information on this case, but it is presumed closed.</p>",

DDS et al. – Settlement Summary \nDATE:  April 27, 2009 \n \nOn April 24, 2009, Judge Robert Freedman granted final approval of the \nclass action settlement agreement in Capitol People First, et al. v. \nDepartment of Developmental Services, et al.  The settlement agreement \nwill greatly increase the opportunities for Californians with developmental \ndisabilities to receive supports and services in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs. \nThe lawsuit was brought in Alameda County Superior Court by 16 \nindividual plaintiffs who resided in, or were at risk of placement in, \ndevelopmental centers or other institutions, three organizational plaintiffs \n(Capitol People First, California Alliance for Inclusive Communities, and \nThe Arc of California), and two taxpayer plaintiffs who asserted that the \nState is spending tax dollars unlawfully by continuing to institutionalize \nindividuals who could live successfully in community homes. \nSettlement Summary: \nIn the Settlement Agreement the defendants have agreed to do the \nfollowing: \n•  Subject to Legislative approval, the Department of Developmental \nServices (DDS) will provide additional funds to each Regional Center \nto assist the Regional Centers in arranging for a case worker to \n\nMemo to Interested persons re CPF Settlement April 2009  Page 2 \nattend Individual Program Plan (IPP) meetings of persons residing in \nstate-run institutions called Developmental Centers (DCs).  In \naddition, DDS shall schedule IPP meetings to permit the attendance \nof DC residents at their IPP meetings.  If a resident  chooses not to \nattend the annual IPP, the Regional Center service coordinator shall \ndiligently seek to obtain information from the resident about his/her \nneeds and preferences to share with the IPP team.   \n•  Regional Centers will provide information to persons living in certain \nlarge private facilities about possible living arrangements in smaller, \ncommunity-based settings.  \n•  DDS will provide training to all DC staff who attend IPP meetings \nabout community living options, community transition services, and \nconsumer choices.  \n•  Disability Rights California will prepare a poster about community \nliving options, Class Member rights, and information about how to \ncontact an advocate for assistance in accessing these services, \nwhich DDS will display at the DCs and which the Regional Centers \nwill send to other institutions for display. \n•  DDS’ contract with the Office of Clients’ Rights at Disability Rights \nCalifornia, and its contract with the State Council on Developmental \nDisabilities, will include a requirement that all Clients’ Rights \nAdvocates (CRAs) provide information and training to class members \nabout community living options.  DDS will provide training to the DC \nand Regional Center CRAs about these options. \n•  DDS, in consultation with the Department of Mental Health, will \nidentify best practice models, develop materials and provide training \nand ongoing technical assistance to enhance the effectiveness of the \nRegional Center and county mental health service systems to better \nidentify and support consumers who are dually diagnosed with a \ndevelopmental disability and a mental illness. \n•  Regional Centers and DDS will continue to use the Community \nPlacement Plan (CPP) process to help class members move from the \nDCs to community settings, and DDS will continue to fund such \nefforts, subject to Legislative Approval.  The CPP is a process by \n2\n \n\nMemo to Interested persons re CPF Settlement April 2009  Page 3 \nwhich Regional Centers identify individuals to be assessed and \nplaced in the community each year, and funds are allocated based on \nthe Regional Center’s approved CPP. \n•  Regional Centers and DDS will develop new community programs \nand housing options, and will to consider class members for such \nprograms and housing. \n•  Subject to Legislative approval, DDS will continue to provide funds to \nRegional Centers to use to help large, private facilities, which serve \npersons with developmental disabilities, to downsize to smaller \ncommunity homes. \nThe lawsuit was settled against all existing defendants, including the State \nof California; the Departments of Developmental Services (DDS), Health \nCare Services (DHCS), Mental Health (DMH); and the 21 local non-profit \nRegional Centers (which contract with DDS).  In addition, the Intervenors, \nCalifornia Association of State Hospital Parent Councils for the Retarded \n(CASH/PCR), California Association for the Retarded (CAR), and several \nindividual developmental center residents, by way of their family members, \nalso support and have signed the Settlement Agreement. \nThe terms of the settlement will remain in effect for three years.  During this \nperiod, Disability Rights California will receive reports which will allow it to \nmonitor the defendants’ performance under the settlement agreement \nBackground of the Case: \nThe CPF class action lawsuit was filed in January 2002, seeking to ensure \nthat Californians with developmental disabilities had access to the services \nthey need to live in and participate in their communities, and avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization.  The class includes the approximately \n2,300 regional center consumers who live in developmental centers and \nthe 4,500 consumers who live in other large congregate institutions housing \n16 or more including skilled nursing facilities and large private Intermediate \nCare Facilities and Community Care Facilities. \nFor more information, please go to www.disabilityrightsca.org.  \n3\n ",

INTRODUCTION. \n  \nPlaintiffs have appealed from the Superior Court’s denial of class action status for a purported class of all California residents \nwith a developmental disability “who are (or become) institutionalized, and those who are at risk of being institutionalized.” \nUnder settled principles of California law, the Superior Court correctly denied class certification, finding that plaintiffs do not \nadequately represent the interests of all members of the putative class, common issues do not predominate among putative \nclass members, and that a class action is not the superior method for resolving this litigation. \n  \nPlaintiffs do not address the substantial evidence of a conflict between the plaintiffs and the putative class which supported \nthe Superior Court’s finding that plaintiffs do not adequately represents the interests of the putative class. Nor can they; \nplaintiffs represent a lobby that is openly hostile to the care provided in California’s Developmental Centers (“DCs”).1 Their \nideology reduces to this: “community” - good; “institution” - bad. Their class action advances a view that “community care” \nis appropriate for the entire putative class, even for those who are profoundly retarded and medically fragile, and even where \nthe families, conservators and professionals most familiar with an individual believe that *2 “community” care offers fewer \nlife opportunities, and more danger, than a DC. \n  \nThe issues raised in this suit are not new. A debate has raged in this country over the course of many years regarding how \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \nbest to treat, care for, and accommodate persons with mental retardation and/or developmental disabilities. On one side are \nthose,  such  as  the  named  plaintiffs  and  their  counsel,  Protection  &  Advocacy,  Inc.  (“PAI”),  who  insist  that  large \ninstitutionalized care is by definition inhumane, unnecessarily restrictive, and violative of human rights. They seek to end all \ninstitutional  care  in  America  and  advocate  placement  of  all  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  in  small, \ncommunity-based programs. On the other side are those, such as organizational intervenors California Association of State \nHospitals / Parents’ Council for the Retarded (“CASH/PCR”) and California Association for the Retarded (“CAR”), who \nbelieve that a “continuum” of care matched to the individual’s needs offer by far the best and safest environment. \n  \nPlaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that they will adequately represent the interests of the putative class as a \nwhole. Plaintiffs’ burden of establishing cohesiveness within the class is especially high because their complaint seeks only \ninjunctive relief. Rather than address this burden and the evidence presented to the Superior Court demonstrating the conflict \nbetween the named plaintiffs and the putative class and the due process concerns raised thereby, plaintiffs ask this Court *3 \nto apply a simplistic, blunt numerical test for adequacy of representation which is not supported by California law. \n  \nMoreover, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that individual issues of fact will necessarily predominate in \nindividual challenges to the Individual Program Plan (“IPP”) process. Plaintiffs failed to prove that the alleged wrongful \nconduct by defendants is occurring on a class-wide basis. Indeed, substantial evidence was presented in the proceeding below \nthat DC residents are not suffering deprivations of fundamental rights such that class-wide relief is appropriate. \n  \nFinally, plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of demonstrating the superiority of a class action. As the Superior Court found, \na class would not provide substantial benefits to the putative class or the court. \n  \nThe ruling of the Superior Court denying class certification should be affirmed. \n  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND. \nA. Identity Of The Intervenors. \n1. Individual Intervenors Live In California DCs And Want To Remain In The Placement Recommended By Their \nIPP. \nIndividual Intervenors reside in California’s Developmental Centers and have been recommended for DC placement pursuant \nto individualized, semi-annual or annual IPPs. (8JA2029, 8JA2031, 8JA2039, 8JA2062, 8JA2073 & 8JA2079.) Individual \nIntervenors desire to remain in a DC *4 setting in accordance with the IPP recommendation because their needs are best met \nin such an environment.2 Individual Intervenors oppose plaintiffs’ position that nearly all individuals with developmental \ndisabilities are best suited to live in a community care setting. Intervenors further disagree that the IPP process is \nfundamentally flawed in favor of DC residence or that parents and conservators are able to unduly influence placement \ndecisions. \n  \n2. Organizational Intervenors Represent Developmentally Disabled Individuals And Their Family Members, Friends, \nAnd Conservators. \nCASH/PCR, created in 1973, is a California non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for persons with mental \nretardation and other developmental disabilities. (8JA2039.) CASH/PCR’s members include conservators, family members \nand concerned friends of California DC residents, as well as family members of those who used to live in California DCs but \nnow live in the community. (8JA2062.) Its members work in close contact with the Department of Developmental Services \n(DDS) and with the staff of California DCs. (8JA2039.) Of the approximately 3,000 residents in California DCs, nearly half \nhave family members or *5 conservators who are members of CASH/PCR or affiliated organizations. (8JA2040.) \n5 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n  \nCAR is a California non-profit whose mission is to advocate for all persons with developmental disabilities and their \nfamilies, enabling them to choose from a full spectrum of service options, including both congregate and community care. \n(8JA2058.) CAR believes that all persons with developmental disabilities should have a choice in where and how they live, \nwork, and play. (Id.) CAR’s 11 local units represent approximately 10,000 parents, friends, and family members of persons \nwith mental retardation. (Id.) \n  \nB. The Conflict Between The Plaintiffs And The Class. \nThis lawsuit is part of the national debate regarding how best to treat, care for, and accommodate persons with mental \nretardation and other developmental disabilities. In this action, plaintiffs purport to represent the following class of \nindividuals: \nAll California residents with a developmental disability, as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code \nsection  4512(b),  who  are  (or  become)  institutionalized,  and  those  who  are  at  risk  of  being \ninstitutionalized, in congregate residential facilities having a capacity of 16 or more individuals. \n  \n  \n(4JA1052; 4JA0967.) On this appeal, plaintiffs assert that the interests of all class members are “aligned.” (AOB at 53.) \nSimilarly, in the proceedings below, plaintiffs claimed that the named plaintiffs “have no interests that conflict with or are \nantagonistic to those of the class,” nor do any “conflicts exist which could hinder the named plaintiffs’ ability to *6 pursue \nthe litigation vigorously on behalf of the class.” (6JA 1543-44 & 4JA0970.) These claims are false; plaintiffs do not speak for \nall. As members of the putative class and representatives with a direct interest in the rights of members of the putative class, \nIntervenors emphatically deny that plaintiffs represent the interests of the entire putative class. (8JA2040; 8JA2059 & \n8JA2073.)3 \n  \n1. The Order Granting The Intervenors Leave To Intervene. \nOn November 20, 2002, Intervenors filed a Motion to Intervene to protect the interests of DC residents and their parents and \nguardians. (1JA0077-249.) Plaintiffs vigorously opposed the Motion, and expressly acknowledged the direct and substantial \nconflict between the Intervenors and the plaintiffs: “The organizations’ and parent representatives’ interests are potentially \nand actually, in conflict with the interests of the plaintiffs and the putative plaintiff class.” (1JA0265) (emphasis added). On \nJanuary 28, 2003, the Superior Court granted the Motion to Intervene, stating: \nIntervenors are granted leave to file a complaint in intervention that addresses issues within the parameters of the complaint. \nIntervenors may not advance new claims or suggest new class definitions for their proposed new claims. If appropriate, the \ncomplaint in intervention may simply seek to ensure that the legal rights of parents and guardians to participate in the \nplanning process and the ability of professionals to *7 recommend placement in developmental centers are not adversely \naffected by any judgment in this action.... \n  \nThe reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action. \n  \n  \n(2JA0546) (emphasis added). \n  \nDespite the clear scope of the Superior Court’s Order, which permitted Intervenors to “address issues within the parameters \nof the Complaint,” (id.) the named plaintiffs mischaracterize the order, claiming that the intervention is limited to “ensur[ing] \nthat the legal rights of parents and guardians to participate in the planning process and the ability of professionals to \n6 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \nrecommend placement in development centers are not adversely affected by any judgment in this action.” (See AOB at 21.)4 \n(Alteration in the original.) This argument reflects a misunderstanding of California law with respect to intervention. Once \nthe Superior Court granted intervention, Intervenors became an independent party to the action, with all of the same rights as \nany other party. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 387;  Deutschmann v. Sears. Roebuck, & Co., 132 Cal. App. 3d 912, 916 (1982). \nWhile plaintiffs may wish that the Superior Court did not grant the Motion to Intervene, this is neither the appropriate time \nnor forum to *8 request reconsideration of that motion. See  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1008. The argument is nothing more \nthan further evidence of plaintiffs’ concerted effort to silence the voices of members of the putative class who oppose \nplaintiffs’ “community-only” viewpoint. Indeed, the purpose of the intervention is precisely to take issue with plaintiffs’ \nrepresentation of the facts, their view of what the law mandates, and to thereby prevent the outcome sought by plaintiffs \nwhich would unquestionably and adversely impact a significant portion of the putative class. \n  \n2. Plaintiffs Do Not Fairly Represent The Class They Purport To Represent. \nPlaintiffs insist that large institutionalized care is by definition inhumane, unnecessarily restrictive, and violative of human \nrights. They seek to end all institutional care in California, and advocate placement of all persons with developmental \ndisabilities in small, community-based programs. (4JA0978-80.) Intervenors, on the other hand, believe that a “continuum of \ncare” tailored to the needs of the individual is more appropriate. (8JA2029-30; 8JA2039; 8JA2059; 8JA2064; 8JA2073; \n8JA2082.) Intervenors accept that some developmentally disabled individuals are able to function in community settings and \nshould be given that opportunity, but know that others are so profoundly impaired that a DC with centralized, constant \nprotection and care is essential. (8JA2030-31; 8JA2062-63; 8JA2073; 8JA2081-82.) \n  \n*9 Plaintiffs oppose institutional care and seek to move nearly all individuals with developmental disabilities into small \ncommunity settings. Plaintiffs’ bias is revealed in their claims that nearly all current DC residents could live in the \n“community” if given proper support. (4JA0942, 4JA0981-82.) Plaintiffs rely upon the following contentions: (1) a majority \nif not all DC residents, with the proper supports, could prosper in integrated community settings; (2) DC residents are not \ngiven understandable information on community services and supports to enable them to make meaningful choices; (3) \nassessment and planning are inadequate and often based on criteria other than individual needs and choices; (4) community \nservices and supports are often not provided in a timely manner, despite IPP recommendations or court orders; (5) DC \nresidents are institutionalized due to defendants’ failure to develop adequate community resources, including those for people \nwith dual diagnosis, behavioral issues and enduring medical needs; and (6) institutionalization adversely impacts DC \nresidents’ quality of life. (AOB 15-16, 29-30, & 42-43.) \n  \nThe evidence presented to the Superior Court in the proceedings below establishes that every single one of these broad \nassertions is wrong or highly questionable. (8JA2027; 8JA2030-31; 8JA2040-41; 8JA2058-59; 8JA2064; 8JA2069-70.) In \nmost cases, current residents whose IPP recommends DC placement should remain in a DC setting. This is true whether or \nnot improved community care settings become available, *10 because the DC remains the least restrictive, most appropriate \nand safest environment available to match these current residents’ needs (subject to IPP re-evaluations). (8JA2027; 8JA2029; \n8JA2031; 8JA2039; 8JA2062; 8JA2069-70; 8JA2073; 8JA2079.) \n  \nC. Community Care Is Not Appropriate For All Individuals With Developmental Disabilities. \nCommunity placement may bring about severe deterioration in the lives of persons who have been moved from the DCs. \n(8JA2030;  8JA2063;  8JA2079-80.)  Those  with  profound  disabilities  need  the  continuous  presence  of  licensed  and \nwell-trained professional personnel (medical doctors, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric technicians) that DCs \nprovide. (8JA2026; 8JA2030-31; 8JA2062-64; 8JA2068-69; 8JA2073; 8JA2081-82.) Community care settings seldom \nprovide highly-trained staff, freedom of movement in a campus-like setting, social activities, a work training center, a school, \na canteen, and numerous opportunities for organized activities that are available in California’s DCs. (Id.) And importantly, \nthe  displacement  of  developmentally  disabled  individuals  to  community  care  settings  can  have  disastrous  effects. \n7 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n(8JA2025-26;  8JA2040;  8JA2044-56;  8JA2059;  8JA2063;  8JA2067-68.)  Personal  experience  has  thus  proven  to  the \nIndividual Intervenors and their families that the DCs often offer the most appropriate and least restrictive environment, with \na better quality of life than is possible in a community facility. \n  \n*11 Plaintiffs’ core allegation is that the government defendants have violated the Lanterman Act and other state and federal \nlaws intended to prevent the unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities. This allegation ignores the essence of \nindividualized IPPs which, beneficially, enable access as required to the unique service-providing capabilities encompassed \nwithin DCs. As participants in the IPP process, Intervenors disagree that it is somehow flawed in a way that results in the \nunnecessary institutionalization of persons with developmental disabilities. (8JA2030; 8JA2040-41; 8JA2058-59; 8JA2064; \n8JA2073-74.) \n  \nD. The Denial Of Class Certification. \nPlaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on September 29, 2005. (4JA1051-6JA1503.) After oral argument, the court \ntook  the  matter  under  submission,  and  thereafter  denied  class  certification  by  order  dated  December  30,  2005. \n(14JA3606-22.) After discussing the many factors relevant to determination of whether to approve or deny class certification \nunder Section 382 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, the Superior Court stated in its ruling: \nThe trier of fact cannot avoid the reality that each IPP is individualized in its development, content, and implementation, and \nthis would restrict the use of sampling or statistical proof at trial. The Court finds that the presence of the Intervenors \ndemonstrates that different class members have different goals, suggesting that claims should be made on an individual basis. \nFinally, the Legislature created the fair hearing procedure under Welfare and Institutions Code 4701-4716 and there is no \nindication that it is not an effective means for individuals to seek relief *12 (14JA3619.) With respect to adequacy of \nrepresentation, the Superior Court found that “Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (1) they will adequately represent the \ninterests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the interests of the Intervenors can be adequately protected by their \npresence in this case.” (14JA3617.) \n  \n  \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW. \n“Because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action, they are \nafforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.”  Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., 23 Cal. 4th 429, 435 (2000). The \ntrial court’s denial of class certification should not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion. The appellate court’s \ntask on appeal is not to determine in the first instance whether the requested class is appropriate, but rather whether the trial \ncourt has abused its discretion in denying certification. See  Caro v. Procter & Gamble Co., 18 Cal. App. 4th 644, 655 \n(1993). Appellate courts should not overturn trial court rulings without a showing of a “clear case of abuse” and a \n“miscarriage of justice.”  Blank v. Kirwan, 39 Cal. 3d 311, 331 (1985). Discretion is “abused” only when, in its exercise, \nthe trial court “exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered.”  Denham v. Super. Ct., \n2 Cal. 3d 557, 566 (1970). \n  \nAbsent other error, “a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed ‘unless (1) improper \ncriteria were used [citation]; or (2) erroneous legal assumptions were made [citation].’ “ *13  Linder, 23 Cal. 4th at 435-36 \n(quoting  Richmond v. Dart Indus., Inc., 29 Cal. 3d 462, 470 (1981)) (alteration in original). “So long as [the trial] court \napplies proper criteria and its action is founded on a rational basis, its ruling must be upheld.” Caro, 18 Cal. App. 4th 655 \n(quoting  Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Super. Ct., 211 Cal. App. 3d 758, 764-65 (1989)) (alteration in original). “ ‘Any \nvalid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.’ ”  Linder, 23 Cal. 4th at 436 (quoting  Caro, 18 \nCal. App. 4th at 656). \n8 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n  \nIV. DISCUSSION. \nA. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Finding That Plaintiffs Failed To Meet Their Burden Of Proving \nA “Well Defined Community Of Interest” Necessary To Demonstrate Adequacy Of Representation. \nIn order to maintain a class action, plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating (1) an ascertainable class, and (2) a \nwell-defined community of interest among the class members. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 382;  Sav-on Drug Stores. Inc. \nv. Super. Ct., 34 Cal. 4th 319, 326 (2004). The “community of interest” requirement requires plaintiffs to demonstrate, among \nother things, that (1) the class representatives can adequately represent the class and their claims are typical of the class, and \n(2) common questions of law or fact predominate over individual issues. See id. In order to demonstrate the requisite \ncommunity of interest, plaintiffs must show that the class representatives’ claims are not inconsistent with the claims of the \nother members of the class, and that the proposed class *14 representatives’ interests are not antagonistic to the remainder of \nthe class.  J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc. v. Super. Ct., 113 Cal. App. 4th 195, 212 (2003). Moreover, plaintiffs must show that \nquestions of law and fact common to the class predominate over questions affecting the individual members, and that upon \ncareful weighing of the burdens and benefits, substantial benefits will accrue to both the litigants and the court from class \ntreatment. Id. at 211; see also  Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Super. Ct., 29 Cal. 4th 1096, 1104 (2003). Plaintiffs’ burden is \nhigh: they must conclusively satisfy the pertinent criteria.  Caro, 18 Cal. App. 4th at 654. As discussed below, the \nSuperior Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the named plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of establishing this \n“community of interest,” making class action treatment of the claims presented inappropriate. \n  \n1. The Named Plaintiffs’ Burden Of Establishing Adequacy Is Especially High Because The Complaint Seeks \nInjunctive Relief Only. \nWhere, as here, the named plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief which, if awarded, would flow to the class as a \nwhole, it is particularly important for the named plaintiffs to prove adequacy of representation. In such cases, the court is not \nrequired to order plaintiffs to provide individual members of the class with notice and the opportunity to opt out. See, e.g., \nHolmes v. Cal. Nat’l Guard, 90 Cal. App. 4th 297, 309 n.8 (2001). For these reasons, class actions seeking only injunctive \nand declaratory relief require more cohesiveness than class actions seeking *15 damages. See, e.g.,  Barnes v. American \nTobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 142-43 (3d Cir. Pa. 1998) (discussing  Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591 \n(1997)). \n  \nAccordingly, the Superior Court in the proceedings below expressly found that it was appropriate to “pay closer attention to \nthe adequacy analysis because individual absent class members would not be permitted to opt out of the class and seek \ninconsistent injunctive relief ....” (14JA3609.) Based on the evidence presented by the Intervenors, the Superior Court made \nthe following ruling with respect to adequacy: \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (1) they will adequately represent the \ninterests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the interests of the Intervenors can be adequately \nprotected by their presence in this case. \n  \n  \n(14JA3617) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs mischaracterize this finding of the Superior Court, stating that “the Superior Court \n9 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \nfound the Intervenors to be adequately protected by their participation in the action.” (AOB at 50.) In fact, the opposite is \ntrue. In finding that the named plaintiffs failed to establish the heightened degree of cohesiveness required for class actions \nseeking injunctive relief, the Superior Court expressly recognized that “because this case concerns systemwide injunctive \nrelief, the Intervenors cannot elect to opt-out of the class.” (14JA3617.) \n  \n*16 2. The Named Plaintiffs Do Not Fairly And Adequately Represent The Interests Of The Putative Class And, In \nFact, Their Interests Directly And Substantially Conflict With The Interests Of Other Putative Class Members. \n“[A] conflict that goes to the very subject matter of the litigation will defeat a party claim of representative status.” \nRichmond, 29 Cal. 3d at 470. “Thus, a finding of adequate representation will not be appropriate if the proposed class \nrepresentative’s interests are antagonistic to the remainder of the class.”  JP. Morgan, 113 Cal. App. 4th at 212 (emphasis \nadded). This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis: “rather than articulating any specific test, we have always \nmaintained that ‘a determination of whether a particular plaintiff can fairly protect the rights of the group he purports to \nrepresent is necessarily dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case.’ ”  Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., 67 Cal. 2d \n695, 710 (1967) (citation omitted). \n  \nThe evidence presented in the proceedings below demonstrated that the named plaintiffs clearly do not possess the same \ninterest as the Intervenors and the putative class as a whole. Individual plaintiffs represent a discrete, small segment of the \ndiverse viewpoints within the overall putative class. Plaintiffs’ disingenuous claim that there is no conflict between the \nproposed class representatives and the putative class members is belied by their own statements. Indeed, in their opposition to \nthe Motion to Intervene, plaintiffs admitted the existence of a direct and substantial conflict between the Intervenors and the \nplaintiffs, stating: \n*17 The organizations’ and parent representatives’ interests are potentially and actually in conflict with \nthe interests of the plaintiffs and the putative plaintiff class. \n  \n  \n(1JA0265) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs’ current claim that the interests of all class members are “aligned” or that the interests \nof the Intervenors and the named plaintiffs are not “diametrically opposed” (AOB at 53) is both disingenuous and false. \n  \nIn the proceedings below, plaintiffs made no attempt to hide their opposition to institutional care. To the contrary, plaintiffs \nstated their intention to move nearly every individual currently living in a DC into a community care facility. (6JA1538-40.) \nThe substantial evidence supporting the Superior Court’s decision that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they would fairly \nand adequately represent the interests of the putative class includes the following: \n  \n(1) The needs of the individual Intervenors and the needs of the children represented by the organizational Intervenors are \nbest met in the DCs. (8JA2029-30, 8JA2040-41, 8JA2058-59, & 8JA2064.) \n  \n(2) The Intervenors disagree with plaintiffs’ contention that the IPP process is unconstitutional or unlawful. (8JA2030, \n8JA2040-41, 8JA2058-59, 8JA2064, & 8JA2073-74.) \n  \nIn addition to this conflict going to the very subject matter of the litigation, plaintiffs’ counsel have been patently antagonistic \ntoward members of the putative class. (8JA2072, 8JA2080-81, & 8JA2084-91.) Plaintiffs’ hostility reflects an inability to \neven-handedly represent the *18 diverse views within the putative class. Denial of class certification was appropriate \nbecause, as the Superior Court found, plaintiffs did not establish their adequacy as class representatives. \n  \n10 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n3. The Named Plaintiffs Ask This Court To Ignore The Conflicts Between The Named Plaintiffs And The Proposed \nClass And Apply An Overly Simplistic Quantitative Test For Adequacy Of Representation. \nPlaintiffs’ burden of establishing adequacy of representation is a basic due process requirement. See, e.g.,  Hansberry v. \nLee, 311 U.S. 32, 45 (1940) ( “Such a selection of representatives for purposes of litigation, whose substantial interests are \nnot necessarily or even probably the same as those whom they are deemed to represent, does not afford that protection to \nabsent parties which due process requires.”). Hansberry is a classic example of the type of disqualifying conflict that can \narise between representatives and some class members. In that plaintiff was seeking to enforce a racially restrictive covenant \non behalf of a class of landowners, some of whom were sympathetic to enforcing the covenant and others who wanted to \nresist its application. The Supreme Court held that an action to enforce an agreement cannot be brought on a class basis on \nbehalf of persons allegedly bound by the agreement if some of them do not wish to have it enforced. \n  \nThe adequacy of representation requirement is not a quantitative matter of comparing the number of named representatives or \nIntervenors to *19 the size of the putative class as a whole. Instead, the Superior Court must conduct a qualitative analysis of \nthe interests of the named plaintiffs and identify conflicts or antagonism within the class. Rather than meaningfully address \nthe evidence presented by the Intervenors, the named plaintiffs, purporting to rely on  Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., \n29 Cal.3d 462, (1981), ask this Court to ignore the evidence demonstrating conflicts and antagonism within the class and \nmechanically apply a quantitative analysis. This is inconsistent with the Superior Court’s order, which found that plaintiffs \ndid not adequately represent the interests of the putative class. This basic prerequisite to maintaining a class action cannot be \nignored. \n  \nRichmond, which involved a claim for damages rather than injunctive relief, can be further distinguished from the facts of \nthis case. As stated above, class actions seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief require more cohesiveness than class \nactions seeking damages. Moreover, the Superior Court expressly found that, because plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief, \nplaintiffs failed to demonstrate that intervention would adequately protect the interests of the Intervenors. The Superior Court \nappropriately considered all of these factors in exercising its discretion to deny plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ attempt to diminish the viewpoint of the Intervenors is not only illogical and an attempt to distract this Court from \nthe conflict recognized by the Superior Court, but is also indicative of how they have treated putative class members who do \nnot share their “community only” *20 agenda. According to plaintiffs, the Intervenors comprise “less than 1/10 of 1% of the \napproximately 7,775 class members.” (AOB at 51.) This statement is contrary to the unrebutted evidence before the Superior \nCourt. (8JA2040.) Moreover, as plaintiffs concede, this action was brought by “16 Californians with developmental \ndisabilities who are institutionalized or at risk of institutionalization, on behalf of themselves and approximately 7,775 \nsimilarly situated Californians.” (AOB at 19.) Applying plaintiffs’ logic, plaintiffs consist of only 16 individuals, which \nconstitutes only 2/10 of 1% of the purported 7,775 class members. Unless they otherwise satisfy the requirements for \nmaintaining a class action, plaintiffs do not obtain representative status simply by asserting claims in a complaint which, as \nthe Superior Court found here, do not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the putative class as a whole. \n  \n4. Plaintiffs Attempt To Distract The Court By Claiming That Intervenors Seek To Challenge The Richard S. \nInjunction. \nIn their Opening Brief, plaintiffs misguidedly attack CASH/PCR and CAR, the intervening organizations, by implying that \ntheir  membership  seeks  to  “unilaterally  veto”  class  members’  preferences  or  IPP  team  recommendations  concerning \ncommunity placement. (AOB at 51.) The injunction in Richard S. v. Department of Developmental Services ordered that a \nfamily member’s, conservator’s or legal representative’s preference for institutional rather than community care was not to be \nconsidered “conclusive” or to prevail over the contrary views of all other qualified and *21 interested personnel on the IPP \nteam. Effectively, the Richard S. injunction denied these people a veto over community placement; it did not affect the rights \nof such people to participate in the decision, nor their right to appeal a decision with which they disagree. \n  \nThis argument does nothing to assist plaintiffs in carrying their burden of demonstrating adequacy, and is nothing more than \n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \nan example of plaintiffs’ open hostility to anyone opposing community placement of DC residents. Moreover, this argument \nis a rehash of arguments presented to the Superior Court more than three years ago on the Motion to Intervene. (2JA0522.) \nAs a substantive matter, the organizational intervenors have neither claimed nor sought the right to veto IPP team decisions. \nInstead, the Intervenors seek to be able to continue to participate in the IPP process and to challenge, when necessary, team \ndeterminations contrary to their interests, as required by law. See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4512(j), & 4646(d)-(f), & 4700 \net seq. \n  \nB. The Superior Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Finding That Plaintiffs Failed To Demonstrate That Common \nFactual Issues Predominate. \nIn addition to failing to meet Section 382’s fair-and-adequate representation requirement, plaintiffs also failed to carry their \nburden of producing evidence to demonstrate the predominance of common questions of law and fact. To show a community \nof interest among class members, the class representative “must show that questions of law or fact common to the class \n‘predominate’ over the questions affecting the individual *22 members.”  J.P. Morgan, 113 Cal. App. 4th at 215. “ \n‘[E]ach member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his [or her] \nright to recover following the class judgment.’ ” Id. at 216 (quoting  City of San Jose v. Super. Ct., 12 Cal. 3d 447, 460 \n(1974)) (second alteration in original). \n  \nPlaintiffs claim that the Superior Court ignored their argument that a common allegation of a governmental defendant’s \ngeneral or systemic policy, procedure, or practice is discriminatory or illegal is sufficient to prove commonality of claims. \nThe cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of this proposition either did not involve an intervening party that opposed class \ncertification, or did not arise in the context of class certification. They thus do not address the impropriety of certifying a \nclass when a significant portion of the putative class opposes the relief sought. Instead, plaintiffs focus only on whether the \nunique circumstances of each individual class member may defeat commonality. While this is certainly part of the inquiry, \nthe Court must also consider the Intervenors’ fundamental opposition to the relief plaintiffs seek, purportedly on Intervenors’ \nbehalf. \n  \n1. Plaintiffs Failed To Establish That The Allegedly Common Violations Or Injuries Occur On A Class-Wide Basis. \nHere, the proposed class lacks the requisite community of interest both with respect to proving the basic violations alleged in \nthe Complaint, and the resultant injury to the putative class. Plaintiffs argue that the requisite community of interest exists \nbased on their contention that the 16868/1069053.2 22 *23 “Defendants, through their common policies and practices, acts, \nand omissions, have prevented class members from receiving the appropriate assessments, supports and services needed to \nlive in non-institutional settings.” (AOB at 28.) Plaintiffs then argue that each representative plaintiffs rights have been \nviolated by this conduct and, because both the representative plaintiffs and the rest of the putative class are subject to \ndefendants’ policies and practices which the representative plaintiffs claim are wrongful, there must be a class-wide violation. \nPlaintiffs’ attempt to extrapolate from the named plaintiffs, who PAI undoubtedly hand-picked because they support \nplaintiffs’ point of view, to the class as a whole is improper and contradicted by the evidence before the Court. \n  \nSpecifically, the Intervenors presented evidence to the Superior Court in the proceedings below that DC residents are not \nsuffering deprivations of fundamental rights such that class-wide relief is appropriate. (8JA2027; 8JA2030; 8JA2040-41; \n8JA2058-59; 8JA2064; 8JA2069; 8JA2073-74.) Additionally, the Intervenors disagree with plaintiffs’ contention that there is \na flaw in the IPP process that favors DC placement or prevents class members from obtaining adequate information. \n(8JA2040-41.) Contrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, the Ninth Circuit recently affirmed that “California’s commitment to the \ndeinstitutionalization of those Developmental Center residents for whom community integration is desirable, achievable and \nunopposed, is genuine, comprehensive and reasonable,” and that “California’s ‘plan is *24 comprehensive, effective, and \nmoving at a reasonable pace.’ ”  Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051, 1067 (9th Cir. 2005). When the IPP team \nrecommends DC placement, it is the result of thoughtful consideration by a team, including numerous professionals. \n12 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n(8JA2031; 8JA2040-41; 8JA2064; 8JA2073.) For the Intervenors, the DCs are the least restrictive, most appropriate, and, \nindeed, the best possible environment. (8JA2027; 8JA2030-31; 8JA2062-64; 8JA2069; 8JA2081-82.) \n  \nSince plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the alleged violations and resultant injury occur on a class-wide basis, the question of \nwhether such violations and injuries occur in a particular case is necessarily an individualized inquiry. There is substantial \ndisagreement within the putative class as to whether defendants have violated the Lanterman Act and other provisions of \nfederal and state law. Accordingly, the Superior Court’s order denying certification is supported by substantial evidence, and \nclass treatment is inappropriate. \n  \n2. The Olmstead Decision Provides No Support For Class Treatment Of The Violations And Injuries Alleged By \nPlaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs selectively cite  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 600 (1999), in support of their argument that allowing \nindividuals to remain in California’s DCs is a form of unlawful discrimination based on disability, and that “[c]ommunity \nplacements can be found when Defendants comply with the law.” (AOB at 4-6.) Under the law, and as the Superior Court \ndetermined, the question of whether an individual with a developmental *25 disability currently residing in a DC could live \nin the community necessarily depends on that individual’s specific circumstances and needs. Plaintiffs’ selective citation to \nthe Olmstead opinion does not create any issue of law or fact that is common to the class. \n  \nIn Olmstead, the United States Supreme Court held that community placement could only be required in the following \ncircumstances: \n[W]hen the State’s treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate, the affected \npersons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into \naccount tile resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities. \n  \n  \nId. at 607 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized several points, including: \n•There is no “federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.” Id. at 602; \n  \n•“[N]othing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to \nhandle or benefit from community settings.” Id. at 601-02; and \n  \n•“Consistent with these provisions, the State generally may rely on the reasonable assessments of its own professionals in \ndetermining whether an individual ‘meets the essential eligibility requirements’ for habilitation in a community-based \nprogram.” Id. at 602. \n  \n  \nHere, IPP teams have determined that community placement is inappropriate for a large, definite percentage of the putative \nclass. Intervenors, both individual and organizational, oppose transfers of DC *26 residents into the community over the \nobjections of the individual or his or her representative. \n  \nMoreover,  the  consideration  of  whether  community  placement  for  any  putative  class  member  can  be  “reasonably \naccommodated,” taking into account both available resources and the needs of DC residents who desire to remain in their \nDC, can only be determined on an individual basis. Plaintiffs neglect to take into account the needs of other DC residents, \nparticularly those whose preference is to continue living in a DC. Equally significant, plaintiffs charge that services in the \ncommunity are inadequate at present. Nevertheless, plaintiffs seek to certify a class in an attempt to advance their \npro-community agenda without regard to whether an appropriate placement for a particular individual is available in the \n13 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \ncommunity. As has been the experience of Intervenors and others similarly situated in the past, such ill-advised placements \ncan result in regrettable, and sometimes even tragic, results. (8JA2030; 8JA2041; 8JA2063; 8JA2079-80.) \n  \nIt is thus beyond dispute that, under the law, even if plaintiffs’ allegations were true (and they are not), the determination of \nwhether the government has complied with Olmstead can only be considered on an individual basis. \n  \n*27 C. The Superior Court’s Order Denying Class Certification Is Consistent With Other Decisions Denying Class \nCertification Where The Evidence Demonstrates A Conflict Of Interest Between The Named Plaintiffs And Other \nMembers Of The Putative Class. \nIn  cases  in  which  parents  of  developmentally  disabled  persons,  and  organizations  representing  such  persons,  have \nsuccessfully intervened, class certification has been denied. (See, e.g., People First of Wash. Inc. v. Rainier Residential \nHabilitation Ctr., No. C96-5906FDB (May 1, 1997), Order Den. Mot. for Class Certification (8JA2172-76);  Baldridge by \nStockley v. Clinton, 139 F.R.D. 119 (E.D. Ark. 1991) (8JA2127-37.)) \n  \nIn People First of Washington, Friends of Rainier, an organization comprised of parents, friends, and family members of \nresidents of Washington’s Rainier Residential Habilitation Center, successfully intervened. In its Order Denying Class \nCertification, the Court stated: \n[T]he prerequisites to a class action, enumerated in  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) do not appear to be satisfied, \nparticularly as to whether the claims of the representative parties are typical of the putative class and \nwhether the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Neither do \nthe elements outlined in  Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b) appear to be satisfied, particularly as to whether the \ndefendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. \n  \n  \n(8JA2172-73.) \n  \nSeveral advocacy groups whose interests are apparently aligned with the named plaintiffs submitted an amicus curiae brief in \nwhich they contend that “federal courts have granted class certification in a wide variety of disability rights and community \nintegration cases despite *28 opposition by some individuals.” (Washington Protection and Advocacy Amici brief at 16.)5 \nThis argument fails for a number of reasons. Perhaps most telling is the fact that the Washington Protection and Advocacy \namici conveniently omit from their discussion the cases denying class certification when families successfully intervened. \nThe named plaintiffs also presented most of the authorities relied upon by amici in the proceedings below, so the Superior \nCourt was aware of these authorities in denying the motion for class certification. (6JA1429-61 & 6JA 1534.) \n  \nMoreover, the argument that other courts have granted class certification in disability rights cases is irrelevant since the \nSuperior Court expressly found that the named plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements for class certification because they \nfailed to demonstrate that they will adequately represent the interests of all the members of the proposed class. As discussed \nin Section III above, the named plaintiffs’ burden on appeal is to show that the Superior Court abused its discretion in \ndenying the motion for class certification. Thus, the exercise of discretion by other courts in diverse factual settings has no \nbearing on the Superior Court’s decision here. For example, in one of the cases cited by the People First of Washington \nAmici, Caroline C. v.  Johnson, 174 F.R.D. 452 (D. Neb. 1996), *29 although the trial court granted a motion for class \ncertification, there was no evidence of a conflict between the named plaintiffs and the rest of the class.  Caroline C., 174 \nF.R.D. at 466 (“While defendants speculate that the interests of the class might conflict at some point in the litigation, they \noffer no evidence, other than speculation, of such a conflict.”). Here, the substantial evidence of a conflict between the named \n14 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \nplaintiffs and other members of the putative class submitted by Intervenors clearly supported the Superior Court’s finding. \n  \nThe other cases cited by the Washington Protection and Advocacy Amici similarly do not support their argument. None of the \ntrial court decisions cited in support of their argument that class certification is “routinely granted” arose in a context similar \nto the instant appeal. See Messier v. Southbury Training School, 183 F.R.D. 350 (D. Conn. 1998); Wyatt v. Poundstone, 169 \nF.R.D. 155 (M.D. Ala. 1995); Vecchione v. Wohlgemuth, 80 F.R.D. 32 (E.D. Pa. 1978). The Washington Protection and \nAdvocacy Amici rely primarily on Vecchione, which arose in the context of a motion to approve a proposed settlement, not a \ncontested motion for class certification. In addition, Vecchione did not involve a successful intervention, nor did any party \nraise a conflict of interest issue sufficient to defeat the adequacy of representation requirement, as occurred in this case. \n  \nWyatt, which involved the denial of a motion for decertification rather than denial of a motion for class certification, is \nsimilarly inapposite. *30 In Wyatt, the court denied the motion to decertify the class based on its finding that the class \nmembers seeking decertification were adequately represented in the litigation by defendants. Wyatt, 169 F.R.D. at 162. \nMessier involved the denial of a motion for intervention, based in large part upon an earlier ruling in the case limiting the \nrelief plaintiffs could permissibly seek. It says nothing about the issue presented to this Court. \n  \nHere, the Superior Court expressly found that “Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (1) they will adequately represent the \ninterests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the interests of the Intervenors can be adequately protected by their \npresence in this case.” (14JA3617.) This finding is supported by substantial evidence, and this Court should not disturb the \nSuperior Court’s proper exercise of discretion in denying certification. \n  \nD. Plaintiffs Did Not Meet Their Burden Of Establishing That A Class Action Would Substantially Benefit The \nLitigants And The Court And Would Be Preferable To Individual Actions. \nThe primary purposes of the class action procedure are judicial economy and efficiency. Because “of the accompanying \ndangers of injustice or of the limited scope within which [class actions] serve beneficial purposes.... [the California Supreme \nCourt] has consistently admonished trial courts to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance \nof the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the  court.” City of San Jose, 12 Cal. 3d at \n459; *31 Daar, Cal. 2d at 713 (“substantial benefits resulting from class litigation, both to the litigants and to the court, \nshould be found before the imposition of a judgment binding on absent parties can be justified.”). “The burden of such a \nshowing falls on plaintiff.”  City of San Jose, 12 Cal. 3d at 460. \n  \nHere, the trial court’s discretionary order denying certification should be affirmed. Based on all the evidence before the court, \nclass certification was properly denied because plaintiffs did not meet their burden of demonstrating substantial benefits of a \nclass action to the litigants, the court, or potential class members. \n  \n1. The Dual Functions Of A Class Action Are Not Served Where Redress Is Adequate By Way Of Individual Claims. \nThe California Supreme Court has observed that the “dual functions” of a class action are to “eliminate[] the possibility of \nrepetitious litigation and provide[] small claimants with a method of obtaining redress of claims which would otherwise be \ntoo small to warrant individual litigation.”  Richmond, 29 Cal.3d at 469. The Superior Court correctly focused on the \nincentives already present under the Lanterman Act for disabled persons to seek relief when they disagreed with their IPPs \nand treatment. (14JA3618); see Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4701-4716. California courts have similarly focused on adequate \nremedies  for  individuals  seeking  redress  in  denying  class  certification.  “Plaintiffs  action  ‘is  singularly  ill-suited  for \nprosecution as a class action’ ” where “plaintiffs individual action provides ... a sufficient vehicle to remedy any wrong [he] \nmay have suffered as a *32 result of defendant[’s] conduct.”  Fuhrman v. Cal. Satellite Sys., 179 Cal. App. 3d 408, 425 \n(1986) (citations omitted). \n  \n15 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907585...   \n \n \n2. Class Treatment Would Not Serve The Interest Of The Court. \nProceeding by way of class action must also be of substantial benefit to the court.  City of San Jose, 12 Cal. 3d at 459; \nLinder,  18  Cal.  3d  at  435.  In  this  case,  imposing  a  class  action  on  behalf  of  all  persons  “who  are  (or  become) \ninstitutionalized, and those who are at risk of being institutionalized” is of no benefit to the Alameda County Superior Court. \nPlacing DC admission, discharge, and review decisions under direct superintendence of the Superior Court would be \nburdensome, cumbersome, and unduly expensive. The end result would be less flexibility in taking appropriate measures in \nindividual cases as needs arise. \n  \nThe process for admission and discharge of eligible residents of California’s DCs remains properly under the control of the \nState’s own professionals and the interdisciplinary teams. The Superior Court, and other courts throughout the State, remain \naccessible in individual cases to address unique and particular issues which may arise. See, e.g., Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ \n4701-4716. \n  \n*33 V. CONCLUSION. \nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification. We respectfully submit that the Order Denying \nCertification must be upheld. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  The California Department of Developmental Services currently operates five DCs, and two smaller state-operated community \n  facilities. \n \n2  Plaintiffs purport to represent not only the approximately 3,000 developmentally disabled individuals who presently live in \n  California’s DCs, but also “some 4, 600” developmentally disabled individuals “living in other institutions.” (Appellant’s Opening \nBrief (“AOB”) at 6.) Unlike the individuals who currently live in DCs and desire to remain in the DC setting, the individuals \ncurrently living in “other institutions” who desire to preserve the status quo have no representation in this litigation. \n \n3  In addition to this conflict, which plaintiffs expressly admitted in the proceedings below, Intervenors pointed to concrete examples \n  of plaintiffs’ hostility toward the Intervenors in the proceedings below. (8JA2072; 8JA2080-81.) \n \n4  Although they are not parties to this action, the proposed brief of amicus curiae Washington Protection and Advocacy System, \n  National Disability Rights Network, Mental Health Advocacy Project, and Public Interest Law Firm of the Law Foundation of \nSilicon Valley, and Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Washington Protection \nand Advocacy Amici”) parrots this mischaracterization of the superior court’s order. (See proposed Washington Protection and \nAdvocacy Amici Brief at 15.) \n \n5  In the proceedings below, the named plaintiffs argued that classes are “routinely certified in civil rights litigation seeking \n  declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of institutionalized persons.” (6JA 1534.) Plaintiffs fail to raise the issue on appeal and \nhave therefore waived the argument. See Stoll v. Shuff, 22 Cal. App. 4th 22, 25 n. 1 (1994). \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n ",

Class litigation to enforce \nthe rights of people with disabilities is ubiquitous and practicable; further, if \nthe class action vehicle is unavailable to institutionalized persons with \ndisabilities, their ability to enforce their civil rights will be at serious risk. \nAmici1 will present information demonstrating that: 1) courts \nroutinely certify classes in these types of systemic reform cases brought on \nbehalf of individuals with developmental disabilities; 2) no significant \nconflicts exist between the class representatives and the putative class \nmembers that would defeat class certification; and 3) if a class is not \ncertified, there will be significant consequences for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the state of California.   \n                                                 \n1 Amici Curiae are five disability advocacy and civil rights organizations, \nall of which are profoundly interested in the issue of the availability of class \nrelief for people with developmental disabilities, as set forth in detail in the \naccompanying Application of Washington Protection and Advocacy System, \nNational Disability Rights Network, Mental Health Advocacy Project and \nPublic Interest Law Firm of the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, and \nDisability Rights Education and Defense Fund for Leave to File Amicus \nCuriae Brief in Support of Plaintiffs and Appellants. \n \n1 \n \n\n \nI.  RELEVANT FACTS  \nIn order to avoid unnecessary duplication and in the interest of \njudicial economy, amici adopt the summary of significant facts set forth in \nplaintiffs’ opening brief. \nII.  ARGUMENT  \nA.  Courts Routinely Certify Classes in System Reform Cases \nInvolving the Deinstitutionalization of Individuals with \nDevelopmental Disabilities and Their Integration into the \nCommunity. \n \n1.  The National Trend to Deinstitutionalize People \nwith Developmental Disabilities is Supported by the \nPassage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nby Significant Case Law Recognizing the Virtues of \nCommunity Integration.   \n     \nOver the last several decades, there has been a national trend to \ndeinstitutionalize individuals with developmental disabilities and integrate \nthem into the community. (See R.W. Prouty & K.C. Lakin, eds., \nResidential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities: Status \nand Trends Through 1998, University of Minnesota, Research and Training \nCenter on Community Living Institute on Community Integration (1999); \nsee also K.C. Lakin, R.W. Prouty, B. Polister & L. Anderson, eds., Over \nThree Quarters of All Residential Services Recipients in Community \nSettings as of June 1999, 38 Mental Retardation 378 (2000).)   \n \n2 \n \n\n \nCongress acknowledged the need to end the pervasive segregation of \nand discrimination against individuals with disabilities when it enacted the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. (42 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.). \nIn doing so, Congress determined that: \n[T]here is a compelling need to provide a clear and \ncomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities and for the \nintegration of persons with disabilities into the economic and \nsocial mainstream of American life. Further, there is a need \nto provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards \naddressing discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.  \n \n(Sen.Rep. No. 110-116, 1st Sess., p. 20 (1989); H.R.Rep. No. 101-485(II), \n2d Sess., p. 50 (1990) [emphasis added].)    \nLikewise, courts have also recognized that institutionalization has \nresulted in discrimination and segregation that “rivaled, and indeed \nparalleled, the worst excesses of Jim Crow.” (City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 462 (Marshall, J., concurring in part & \ndissenting in part); see also id. at 454 (Stevens, J., concurring) [individuals \nwith mental retardation subjected to “history of unfair and often grotesque \nmistreatment”].) Following the passage of the ADA, courts held that the \nADA obliges states to affirmatively take steps to end segregation of and \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities—including those with \ndevelopmental disabilities—who have been institutionalized. (See \n \n3 \n \n\n \nOlmstead v. L.C. (1999) 527 U.S. 581, 605-606,2 see also Helen L. v. \nDidario (3rd Cir. 1995) 46 F.3d 325.3) The Olmstead court noted that in \nenacting the ADA, Congress intended to remedy the historical isolation and \nsegregation of individuals with disabilities and discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities “‘in such critical areas as . . . \ninstitutionalization’” finding that the discrimination manifested itself in \n“‘outright intentional exclusion, . . . failure to make modifications to \nexisting facilities and practices, . . . [and] segregation.’” (Olmstead v. L.C., \nsupra, 527 U.S. at pp. 588-89 [citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(2), (3), (5)].) \nThe Court recognized the discriminatory impact of the fact that: \nIn order to receive needed medical services, persons with \nmental disabilities must, because of those disabilities, \nrelinquish participation in community life they could enjoy \ngiven reasonable accommodations, while persons without \n                                                 \n2 In Olmstead, plaintiffs were two persons with developmental disabilities \nand mental illnesses. Both had a history of treatment in institutions. Both \nremained institutionalized even after their treating professionals found them \nready for community placement. They sued, alleging that the state’s failure \nto place them in a community-based program, once their treating \nprofessionals determined such a placement was appropriate, violated Title \nII of the ADA. (Id. at p. 1.) \n3 In Helen L., plaintiffs challenged the Pennsylvania Department of Public \nWelfare’s policy of providing services to persons with disabilities in \nsegregated institutional settings instead of integrated community-based \nsettings. (Id. at pp. 335-339.) The Third Circuit held that the ADA and its \nattendant regulations defined unnecessary segregation in institutions as a \nform of illegal discrimination against people with disabilities. (Id. at p. \n333.) \n \n4 \n \n\n \nmental disabilities can receive medical services they need \nwithout similar sacrifice. \n \n(Id. at p. 601.) \n2.  Federal Cases Granting Class Certification Are \nRelevant in California, and Numerous Federal \nCourts Have Granted Class Certification in Cases \nSimilar to This One.  \n \n Thus, it is clear that Congress and the courts have recognized that \nthe unnecessary institutionalization of people with developmental \ndisabilities is a manifest violation of their fundamental rights.  However, \nthe Superior Court’s decision in this case deprived these people of a vital \nweapon in fighting these violations—the class action vehicle. \nCases involving deinstitutionalization of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities, such as this one, are exceptionally well-suited \nfor class treatment because the claims can be proven by showing systemic \nviolations, such as the failure to adopt or follow policies and practices and \napply them uniformly to the class members. People with disabilities, \nespecially those who are isolated in institutions, almost always lack the \nresources to remedy violations of their individual rights based on systemic \npolicies, practices and service gaps, leaving class litigation brought on \nbehalf of themselves and others in similar circumstances as the only route \nto needed reform. In fact, class actions have become the quintessential \nmeans for enforcing the rights of institutionalized persons, to address not \n \n5 \n \n\n \nonly unlawful conditions of confinement but also policies and practices that \nresult in widespread unnecessary institutionalization. \nPlaintiffs here seek systemic relief to remedy defendants’ unlawful \npolicies and practices that result in unnecessary institutionalization and in \ndefendants’ failure to integrate plaintiffs and putative class members into \nthe community in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights. (See \n4JA1036-1042 [Fifth Amended Complaint, “Relief Requested,” pp. 95-101, \n¶¶ 1-16]; see also 4JA1060, 1061-1071 [Plaintiffs’ Mem. Ps & As in Supp. \nMot. for Class Cert., pp. 2, 3-13].)  Specifically, plaintiffs seek declaratory, \nmandamus and injunctive relief compelling defendants to develop, adopt \nand implement policies4 and practices that will successfully integrate \nplaintiffs and the putative class members into the community and to take \nsteps to provide the necessary services and supports to those individuals \nwho are at risk of institutionalization. (See 4JA0983-0985 [Fifth Amended \nComplaint, ¶¶ 171, 173].)   \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief addresses in detail the reversible errors the \nSuperior Court committed when it ignored and misapplied California case \nlaw in denying class certification. Amici agree with plaintiffs’ state-law \n                                                 \n4 In some instances it appears defendants have appropriate policies but do \nnot consistently implement them.  \n \n \n6 \n \n\n \nanalysis and therefore will not rehash it here. However, the Superior Court \nalso misapplied federal case law in relying on the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals’ ruling in J.B. v. Valdez (10th Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d 1280. In Katie \nA., et al. v. Diana Bonta, et al. (C.D.Cal. June 18, 2003, No. CV-02-5662), \nthe District Court for the Central District of California certified a class of \nfoster children seeking mental health services in California. In certifying \nthe class, the court correctly declined to follow Valdez, finding that that \ncase was inconsistent with other Ninth, Third and Second Circuit rulings in \nwhich classes had been certified, and also applied reasoning that conflicted \nwith “strong public policy arguments favoring availability of class action \nremedies to those subjected to ‘system-wide practice[s] or polic[ies].’” (Id. \nat p. 16 [citing Armstrong v. Davis (9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d. 849, 868; \nWalters v. Reno (9th Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 1032, 1047].) \nAlthough federal cases are not controlling, California courts have \nheld that the existence of federal court cases certifying classes in similar \ncontexts is indicative that class certification is appropriate. (See Mendoza v. \nTulare (1980) 128 Cal.App.3d 403, 419-20 [class of prisoners seeking \nprison reforms certified; court found commonality requirement satisfied in \nspite of the differences among class members’ legal status].) The \ncircumstances of the named and putative class members in the Capitol \n \n7 \n \n\n \nPeople First case are analogous and in some cases identical to those in the \ncases identified and discussed below, so these cases are highly relevant.   \nFor example, courts in the Ninth Circuit have routinely certified \nclasses in cases similar to the one before the Court. In Armstrong, the Ninth \nCircuit upheld the class certification of prisoners with disabilities who \nalleged that defendants had discriminated against them in parole and parole \nrevocation hearings based upon their disabilities. (Armstrong v. Davis, \nsupra, at p. 868.) The court held that although the prisoners had different \ndisabilities and accommodation needs, those differences did not defeat class \ncertification because the defendants’ policies and their implementation \nwere at issue and the defendants’ conduct was common to the class. (Ibid.)  \nFurthermore, in Townsend v. Quasim (9th Cir. 2003) 328 F.3d 511, 515, the \ncourt certified a class of Medicaid recipients with disabilities seeking an \ninjunction preventing the state from requiring them to move from nursing \nhome facilities as a condition of receiving Medicaid services.   \nEmily Q., et al., v. S. Kimberly Belshe, et al. (C.D.Cal. May 5, 1999, \nCase No. CV-98-4181) is an additional disability rights case in which a \nfederal court in California certified a class, rejecting challenges to the issue \nof commonality by the defendants. In Emily Q, the court certified a class \ncomposed of all current and future children under the age of 21 who were \nMedicaid beneficiaries placed in locked mental health treatment facilities or \n \n8 \n \n\n \nbeing considered for placement in such facilities or had undergone at least \none emergency psychiatric hospitalization related to their current disability \nwithin the preceding 24 months. (Id. at p. 1.)  \nNumerous other courts throughout the country have also certified \nclasses similar to the one proposed in this case. For example, in Ligas v. \nMaram (N.D. Ill.) 2006 WL 644474, the court recently certified a class of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities who challenged the state of \nIllinois’ failure to provide them with the option to receive long-term care \nservices in the most integrated setting. (Id. at *1.) Defendants argued that \nplaintiffs failed to meet class commonality requirements because not all of \nthe class members would be entitled to the proposed relief and because of \ntheir factual differences. (Id. at *2.) In certifying the class, the court held \nthat “the proposed class is challenging the defendants’ failure to enact \npolicies regarding community placement, and in assessing this standardized \nconduct, common questions of law and fact predominate.” (Id. at *3.)  \nIn two similar cases in Washington, Allen, et al. v. Western State \nHospital, et al. (W.D.Wash. May 17, 1999, Case No. 99-5018) and Marr, et \nal. v. Eastern State Hospital, et al. (E.D.Wash. April 29, 2002, Case No. \n02-0067), the United States District Courts for the Western and Eastern \nDistricts of Washington certified classes in cases involving claims brought \nby individuals with developmental disabilities with mental health treatment \n \n9 \n \n\n \nneeds. In both Allen and Marr, the class members brought claims against \nthe state of Washington for inadequate conditions of care at the state \nhospital, failure to provide them with integrated community living \narrangements, and failure to provide them with adequate and appropriate \ncommunity-based habilitative and mental health services. (Allen at pp. 3-\n11, Marr at pp. 3-12.) Both courts specifically found that in spite of the \ndifferences in the treatment needs and other individual variations among the \nclass members, the commonality requirements had been met because the \ndefendants’ conduct had been common to the plaintiffs and the plaintiff \nclass. (Allen at pp. 5, 6, 9-11, Marr at pp.3, 7-9.)   \na.  Appellate Courts Certifying Classes in \nDisability Rights Cases \n \nThe following is a list and summary of disability rights actions in \nwhich classes have been certified.  Most of these cases are community \nintegration cases precisely analogous to the Capitol People First case.5     \nFrederick L. v. Dept. of Public Welfare (3d Cir. 2005) 422 F.3d 151, \n153 (court certified class of individuals with mental illnesses seeking \ndischarge from psychiatric institution and integration into community-\nbased mental health programs);  \n \n                                                 \n5 The listed cases are examples of cases brought on behalf of individuals \nwith disabilities in institutions or in the community in which a class has \nbeen certified.  Some of the decisions cited grant class certification; others \ndo not address class certification, but reflect the court’s earlier \ndetermination and definition of a class. \n \n10 \n \n\n \nArmstrong v.

Wohlgemuth (E.D.Pa. 1978) 80 F.R.D. 32 (court \ncertified class of individuals with mental illness and individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities seeking remediation of their conditions of care at \nstate-operated psychiatric facilities). \n \nIn the cases discussed above, although the individual circumstances \nand treatment needs of class members differed, the courts consistently \nfound that the defendants’ conduct was common to the named plaintiffs and \nclass members and thus found that the commonality requirements for class \ncertification were satisfied and certified the classes. The Court here should \nfind that plaintiffs have met the commonality requirements of Code of Civil \nProcedure, section 382, reverse the trial court’s order, and issue an order \ndirecting the trial court to certify the class in this case.   \nC.  The Presence of Dissenting Class Members or Intervenors \nHas Not Been a Barrier to Class Certification in Similar \nClass Actions Around the Country. \n \n In addition to erroneously ruling that class treatment was not proper \n \n14 \n \n\n \ndue to lack of commonality, the Superior Court also erred when it allowed \nthat the objections of a group of people constituting less than 1 percent of \nthe putative class to defeat class certification. \nThe Superior Court permitted intervention in this case for the limited \npurpose of “ensur[ing] that the legal rights of parents and guardians to \nparticipate in the planning process and the ability of professionals to \nrecommend placement in developmental centers are not adversely affected \nby any judgment in this action.” (2JA0545-0548 [January 28, 2003 Order].) \nNothing in the relief proposed by plaintiffs herein will adversely affect \nthose interests.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin defendants from further \nperpetuating their discriminatory and unlawful conduct that results in the \nunnecessary institutionalization of plaintiffs and members of the putative \nclass. Specifically, plaintiffs seek an order from the Court requiring \ndefendants to properly implement California’s Lanterman Developmental \nDisabilities Services Act (“Lanterman Act”) and other state and federal \nlaws by providing the required assessments and individual planning and \nthen developing adequate community services and supports to meet the \nidentified needs. (See 4JA1036-1042 [Fifth Amended Complaint “Relief \nRequested,” ¶¶ 1-16].) \nJust as significant as the relief that plaintiffs seek is the relief that \nthey do not seek:  plaintiffs do not seek alteration of the legal requirements \n \n15 \n \n\n \nand individual rights under the Lanterman Act or other state and federal \nlaws to an individual planning process and services and related individual \nadministrative or court review of disagreements regarding these matters, or \nalteration of the legal requirements and individual rights to services under \nthe Lanterman Act or other state or federal laws. \nThe trial court committed reversible error by holding that because \nthe intervenors, who oppose community placement, represent some of the \nputative class members, the named plaintiffs could not adequately represent \ntheir interests. (14JA3617 [Order Denying Class Certification].)  Amici \nagree with plaintiffs’ analysis in their opening brief, including the existence \nof controlling California precedent in the form of Richmond v. Dart Indus., \nInc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 479, prohibiting denial of class certification on \nthe basis applied by the Superior Court. \nIn addition, over the course of decades, federal courts have granted \nclass certification in a wide variety of disability rights and community \nintegration cases despite opposition by some individuals.  In numerous \nsystemic reform cases brought on behalf of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities, courts have certified classes, finding the named plaintiffs were \nadequate representatives even where disagreements as to prospective relief \nexisted. (See e.g., Vecchione, supra, 80 F.R.D at p. 57, cited approvingly by \nCarolyn C. (D.Neb. 1996) 174 F.R.D. 452, 466  [holding that court may not \n \n16 \n \n\n \nrefuse to certify a class simply because it believes that “members of the \nclass may [at some point] prefer to leave [a] violation of their rights \nunremedied” (citations omitted)].) \nIn Vecchione, a class was certified of individuals with mental \nillnesses and individuals with developmental disabilities. (Id. at p. 50.) \nWhen the court was asked to approve the settlement, a group representing \nclass members with developmental disabilities objected to the settlement on \nthe grounds that it was of benefit to class members with mental illness but \nstigmatized and harmed the class members with developmental disabilities \nand moved to alter or amend the class. (Id. at pp. 40-41.) The court rejected \nthe objections and denied the motion to alter or modify the class to remove \nthe individuals with developmental disabilities from the class, holding that \nto do so would be “drastic and untoward.” (Id. at p. 49.) Specifically, the \ncourt found that removing them from the class would cause those class \nmembers to continue to suffer the unconstitutional practices of the \ndefendants. (Id. at p. 57.)   \nThe fact that the intervenors do not object to defendants’ \nunconstitutional and unlawful practices and believe that placement in the \ninstitution is the best service available does not result in a conflict between \nthe named plaintiffs and those represented by the intervenors that prevents \nclass certification. (See Messier v. Southbury Training School (D.Conn. \n \n17 \n \n\n \n1998) 183 F.R.D. 350, 356; Wyatt By and Through Rawlins v. Poundstone \n(M.D.Ala. 1995) 169 F.R.D. 155; see also Caroline C., By and Through \nCarter v. Johnson (D.Neb. 1996) 174 F.R.D 452, 466.) Class certification is \nparticularly beneficial to the class—including future class members—\nwhere, as here, an action seeks to end discriminatory and unlawful practices \nby defendants. (See Messier, supra, 183 F.R.D. at p. 356; Caroline C., \nsupra, 174 F.R.D. at 466.)  \n  Similar issues have been addressed in other institutional class \nlitigation around the nation involving people with disabilities in which \nsome individuals opposed class certification. Courts have not denied class \ncertification in the vast majority of such cases. “[T]he question should not \nbe whether there is a 100% concurrence of interests within the class, but \nrather whether the class as a whole and as to some primary issues being \nlitigated is being adequately represented.” (Wyatt, supra, 169 F.R.D. at p. \n161 [court refused to decertify class challenging discriminatory and \nunconstitutional practices by the state in failing to place individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the community where some class members \nopposed community placement]; see also Messier, supra, 183 F.R.D. at p. \n355 [court refused to allow some class members to opt out of class in case \nbrought on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities where 85% \nof the class opposed community placement].) As plaintiffs demonstrate in \n \n18 \n \n\n \ntheir opening brief, regardless of how one calculates the percentage of the \noverall putative class that defendant intervernors comprise in the instant \ncase, it is small—significantly less than in Messier.   \n   The presence of this handful of objectors should not be allowed to \nnullify the rights of all Californians with developmental disabilities. Absent \nclass certification, individuals with developmental disabilities in California \nare likely to continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of the state’s and \nthe regional centers’ continuing and widespread failure to provide services \nand supports to plaintiffs and the putative class members in the most \nintegrated settings. \nD.   If a Class Is Not Certified, the Putative Current and \nFuture Class Members Are Unlikely to Pursue Their \nClaims and Will Consequently Be Subjected to Needless \nOngoing Segregation. \n \n The Superior Court compounded its errors regarding commonality \nand adequacy by erroneously ruling that a class action was not a superior \nmeans of redress here.  This conflicts with a long line of precedent holding \nthat when courts examine the ability of class members to maintain separate \nactions, they are to  examine factors including, but not limited to, \n“geographical diversity of class members, the ability of individual members \nto institute separate suits, and the nature of the underlying action and the \nrelief sought.” (See National Association of Radiation Survivors v. Walters \n \n19 \n \n\n \n(N.D.Cal. 1986) 111 F.R.D. 595, 599 [class certification appropriate where \nclaimants with disabilities and their widows may be unable to bring \nindividual suits due to lack of financial resources].) In Armstead v. Pingree \n(M.D. Fla. 1986) 629 F.Supp. 272, 279, the court specifically pointed out \nthat institutionalized individuals with developmental disabilities are \nparticularly suited for class certification, saying: \nThe Court has also considered the ability of the individual \nplaintiffs to bring his or her own separate action if the \namended class certification were denied. Considering \nplaintiffs’ confinement, their economic resources, and their \nmental handicaps, it is highly unlikely that separate actions \nwould follow if class treatment were denied. This is precisely \nthe type of group which class treatment was designed to \nprotect. \n \n(Id. at p. 279 [emphasis added].)   \n  As in Armstead, here the named plaintiffs seek to represent \nindividuals with developmental disabilities who are institutionalized. As a \nresult of their confinement, and their limited economic resources, they \nwould find it extremely difficult to bring separate actions.   \n  Moreover, individuals such as the plaintiffs and the putative class \nmembers are unlikely to be able to find counsel to represent them \nindividually given the dearth of private counsel who are experienced and \nwilling to litigate these cases. (See Michael L. Perlin, Fatal Assumptions: A \nCritical Analysis of the Role of Counsel in Mental Disability Cases, 16 Law \n \n20 \n \n\n \n& Hum. Behav. 39, 42, 49 (1992).) No Sixth Amendment right to counsel \nexists in these types of cases. (See Fatal Assumptions, supra, 16 Law & \nHum. Behav. at pp. 47-49.) Thus, in order to obtain counsel, a person is \nlikely to have to pay for counsel, an impossible proposition for much of the \nputative class, given their limited resources.   \n  This case presents issues of significant importance for the rights of \nindividuals with disabilities, particularly individuals with developmental \ndisabilities who are institutionalized or are at risk of institutionalization. If a \nclass is not certified in this case, each and every individual of the \napproximately 7,775 class members who are institutionalized would need to \ncome before the court and present the same facts pertaining to the \ndefendants’ conduct, provided each individual had the resources and ability \nto bring an individual case, which is highly unlikely. Thus, absent class \ncertification, the unnamed current and future class members are at serious \nrisk of being unable to have their day in court, continuing to be denied \naccess to services to which they are entitled and to be subjected to \ndiscrimination as a result of needless segregation. Class certification here is \nnecessary to “prevent a failure of justice.” (Mendoza, supra, 128 \nCal.App.3d at p. 416 [citing City of San Jose v. Superior Court (1974) 12 \nCal.3d 447, 458].) \n \n21 \n \n\n \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Contrary to the trial court’s decision in this case, classes have been \ncertified in the overwhelming majority of similar cases where individuals \nwith developmental disabilities have brought actions to vindicate their \nrights to live and receive services in the most integrated setting.  And courts \nhave also consistently held that intervenors’ objection to the proposed \nremedy poses no obstacle to certification. Consistent with these cases, this \nCourt should reverse the trial court’s denial of class certification and direct \nthe trial court to enter a new order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification.  \n \n  DATED this 7th day of November 2006. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nLAW FOUNDATION OF SILICON VALLEY \n        PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM \n                       \n \n        _________________________________  \nBy James F.

Const. Art. VI, § 10 ............................................................................. 55 \nIX \n\nI.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis is a civil rights class action brought on behalf of \nthousands of Californians with developmental disabilities who are \nneedlessly isolated and segregated from mainstream society in large \ncongregate institutions.  Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' policies and \npractices that result in such unnecessary and unlawful segregation.  At issue \nin this appeal is the Superior Court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification. \nThe representative Plaintiffs did not bring this lawsuit to \nobtain individualized outcomes for each class member.  Rather, Plaintiffs \nseek to correct the unlawful policies and practices in place throughout \nCalifornia that deny Californians with developmental disabilities their right \nunder federal and state law to live as part of, rather than apart from, our \nneighborhoods and communities. \nIn its order denying class certification, the Superior Court \nheld that Plaintiffs had demonstrated ascertainability, numerosity, typicality \nand adequacy of counsel but had failed to establish commonality, adequacy \nof the class representatives and superiority (the \"Order\").  See 14JA3606-\n22.1  The Superior Court committed reversible error by refusing to certify \nCitations to the Joint Appendix (\"JA\") or Joint Appendix of Documents \n1 \nFiled Under Seal (\"JS\") are by volume and page number; citations to the \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page.) \n1 \n\nthe class: \nCommonality:  Every member of Plaintiffs' class has identical \nlegal rights and this lawsuit seeks only to enforce those common legal \nrights without seeking individual determinations or individual placement \ndecisions.  The Superior Court held that Plaintiffs had met the test for \ncommonality under Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 \nCa1.4th 319 through evidence that Defendants have acted or refused to act \non grounds generally applicable to the class.  The Superior Court should \nhave stopped there but, instead, it improperly relied on a federal case that is \nout of step with California precedent and the majority rule in federal cases. \nThe Superior Court also erred by not considering Plaintiffs' evidence from \nadmissions, sampling, statistics and experts to establish the existence and \neffect of Defendants' policies and practices - modes of establishing \ncommonality long accepted in California. \nAdequacy:  The Superior Court turned binding case law and \ncommon sense upside down when it held that objection from less than 1%   \nof the class members was a reason to deny class certification.  That holding \nviolates Richmond v. Dart Indus., Inc. (1981) 29 Ca1.3d 462 and cannot \nstand. \n(Footnote Continued from Previous Page.) \nReporters' Transcript (\"RT\") are by page and line number. \n2 \n\nSuperiority:  Although the Superior Court rightly recognized \nthat Plaintiffs seek systemic relief, not individual relief, it held that the class \nmembers must seek relief through a statutory fair hearing.  In so holding, \nthe Superior Court ignored the fact that such fair hearings would be useless \nbecause that forum is incapable of either granting systemic relief or \notherwise addressing Plaintiffs' challenge to Defendants' systemic policies \nand practices. \nThe Superior Court thus made three errors of law and its \nOrder should be reversed so that the legal rights common to every \nCalifornian with developmental disabilities can be adjudicated in a single \nforum. \nII.  STATEMENT OF APPEALABILITY \nA trial court's denial of a motion for class certification \"to an \nentire class\" is subject to an immediate appeal.  Linder v.  Thrifty Oil Co. \n(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429,435.  The Order at issue here (14JA3606-3622) falls \nsquarely within that rule.  Appellants previously explained why this Court \nhas appellate jurisdiction in their opposition to the State Defendants' \nmotion to dismiss, and this Court's May 8, 2006 Order denying that motion \nis dispositive of the issue. \nIII.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  BACKGROUND AND STATEMENT OF FACTS \n3 \n\n1.  Californians with developmental disabilities share a \ncommon set of rights under federal and state law, \nentitling them to be served in the least restrictive \nsetting. \nForty years ago, the primary setting for providing out-of-\nhome services and supports to people with developmental disabilities was \nin large, congregate \"institutions.\"  6JA1486.  Changes came as state \nlegislatures, Congress, and the courts recognized that unnecessary \nsegregation of people in institutions is stigmatizing, socially isolating, and a \nform of unlawful discrimination.  In enacting the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), Congress found that \"historically, society has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such \nforms of discrimination ... continue to be a serious and pervasive social \nproblem.\"  42 U.S.c. § 12101(a)(z).  In holding that unnecessary \ninstitutionalization violates the ADA, for example, the Supreme Court, in \nL.c. \nOlmstead v.  (1999) 527 U.S. 581,597,600-01, recognized that \nunnecessary institutionalization \"perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that \npersons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in \ncommunity life\" and \"severely diminishes the everyday life activities of \nindividuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, \neconomic independence, educational advancement, and cultural \nenrichment. \" \nWith the enactment of the Lanterman Developmental \n4 \n\nDisabilities Services Act (\"Lanterman Act\"), Welfare and Institutions Code \nsection 4500 et seq.  the California Legislature established a \n,2 \ncomprehensive statutory scheme to provide services to people with \ndevelopmental disabilities.3  The purpose of the Lanterman Act is to \npromote integration and inclusion of people with developmental disabilities \nin the community - that is, \"to prevent or minimize the institutionalization \nof developmentally disabled persons and their dislocation from family and \ncommunity [citations], and to enable them to approximate the pattern of \neveryday living of nondisabled persons of the same age and to lead more \nindependent and productive lives in the community.\" Ass'n for Retarded \nCitizens-Cal. v. DDS (1985) 38 Cal.3d 384,388 (\"ARC'). \nToday, under California and federal law, the primary and \npreferred settings for providing services to people with developmental \ndisabilities - regardless of the nature or severity of their disabilities or \ntreatment needs - are in the community.  See §§ 4501, 4502(a) & (b), \n4750; Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at p. 589 n.l, 600 (recognizing the \nStatutory cites are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise \n2 \nindicated. \n3\"Developmental disability\" is defined in § 4512(a) and refers to a \ndisability that originates before age 18, continues or can be expected to \ncontinue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that \nindividual.  It includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and \nautism, among other conditions. \n5 \n\nenactment of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the ADA, and changes to \nMedicaid law that promoted home and community-based care); Gov. Code \n§ 11135; 6JA1486-88.  Nevertheless, almost 3,000 Californians with \ndevelopmental· disabilities still live in the state's large public congregate \ninstitutions (known as \"Developmental Centers\" or \"DCs\") and some 4,600 \nothers living in other institutions.  6JA1463-64 & 1466.  Community \nplacements can be found when Defendants comply with the law. \n4JA1066(n.5).  For example, a number of the named Plaintiffs who had \nbeen institutionalized for many years were placed into the community only \nafter commencement of this action - in one instance after 40 years of \ninstitutionalization.  Id. \n2.  All class members are served by the same \ncomprehensive statutorily created service system \ninvolving the coordination of services of many state \ndepartments and community agencies. \nAll class members are entitled to the rights guaranteed under \nthe Lanterman Act.  Direct responsibility for implementation of the \nLanterman Act service system is allocated between the State Department of \nDevelopmental Services (\"DDS\") and 21 Regional Centers (\"RCs\"),4 \nwhich, pursuant to contracts with DDS, provide services to individuals who \n4 RCs are private nonprofit entities established pursuant to the Lanterman \nAct that contract with the DDS to carry out many of the state's \nresponsibilities under the Act.  They are monitored and funded by DDS. \n(Footnote Continued on Next Page.) \n6 \n\nreside or once resided in a specified geographic area.  § 4620 et seq.  RCs \nare to \"assist persons with developmental disabilities and their families in \nsecuring those services and supports which maximize opportunities and \nchoices in living, working, learning and recreating in the community.\" \n§ 4640.7(a).  DDS allocates funds to the RCs for both operations and \npurchase of services, including funding to purchase community-based \nservices and supports.  §§ 4620, 4787. \nDDS is responsible for ensuring that the Lanterman Act is \nfully implemented, § 4416, and must monitor the RCs to ensure that they \noperate in compliance with federal and state law, provide high quality \nservice coordination, and secure services and supports for individuals and \ntheir families.  E.g., §§ 4416, 4434, 4500.5, 4501, 4620. \nLanterman Act services are intended to meet the needs and \nchoices of each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or \ndegree of disability, and to promote his or her integration into the \nmainstream of the community.  § 4501.  Moreover, such services must \nprotect the personal liberty of the individual, be provided with the least \nrestrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of the treatment, \nservices or supports, and enable the individual to approximate the pattern of \n(F ootnote Continued from Previous Page.) \nSee, e.g., § 4620. \n7 \n\nevery day living available to people without disabilities of the same age. \n§§ 4501, 4502(a)(b), 4750. \nUnder the Lanterman Act, each Californian with a \ndevelopmental disability is legally entitled to \"treatment and habilitation \nservices and supports in the least restrictive environment.\"  § 4502.  The \nCalifornia Supreme Court explained that this \"entitlement\" consists of a \n\"basic right and a corresponding basic obligation: the right which it grants \nto the developmentally disabled person is to be provided with services that \nenable him to live a more independent and productive life in the \ncommunity; the obligation which it imposes on the state is to provide such \nservices.\"  See ARC, supra, 38 Cal. 3d at p. 39l. \nServices provided to people with developmental disabilities \n- including those residing in the community, DCs and in other public and \nprivate institutions - are determined through an individual planning \nprocess that must meet uniform statutory requirements.  E.g., §§ 4418.3, \n4512U), 4646, 4646.5, 4647.  Under this process, planning teams, which \ninclude, among others, the person with a developmental disability -\nreferred to in the Act as \"consumers\" (§ 4512(d)) - his or her legally \nauthorized representative, and one or more regional center representatives, \njointly prepare an Individual Program Plan (\"IPP\") based on the \nconsumer's needs and choices. \nThe Lanterman Act requires that the IPP promote community \n8 \n\nintegration.  § 4646(a).  To this end, DDS and RCs must ensure that \nplanning teams develop goals that maximize opportunities and teach skills \nneeded for each person to develop relationships, be part of community life, \nincrease control over his or her life and acquire increasingly positive roles \nin the community.  § 4646.5.  The IPP must give the highest preference to \nthose services and supports that allow minors to live with their families and \nadults to live as independently as possible in the community.  E.g., \n§ 4648(a)(1), (2).  Thus, the planning team is required to consider for each \nresident of a Developmental Center or other institution what barriers exist \nthat must be addressed to enable the individual to live in an alternative, \nintegrated community setting.  See § 4509.  Once services or supports are \nincluded in an individual's IPP, the RC has a mandatory non-discretionary \nduty to provide these services and supports.  § 4648. \nTo enable people with developmental disabilities, and their \nrepresentatives, to participate meaningfully in the IPP process, the \nLanterman Act requires that DDS and RCs provide information in an \nunderstandable form to help people make choices.  § 4502.1.  This entails \nproviding information on the range of alternative living arrangements and \nthe community services and supports that would enable the individual to \nlive in a non-institutional setting. \nIf the services and supports needed by an individual to live in \nthe least restrictive community setting are not currently available, the \n9 \n\nLanterman Act requires RCs to engage in program development. \n§§ 4648(e), 4651, 4677.  DDS and RCs are specifically required to provide \nemergency and crisis intervention services so people with developmental \ndisabilities do not lose their community homes.  § 4648(a)(10). \nTo ensure that the mandated array of quality living \narrangements, services and supports is available, DDS is required to \nestablish and maintain equitable systems of payment for providers that \nreflect the actual costs of ensuring high quality, stable services, and ensure \nthat people live in the least restrictive setting.  §§ 4648(a)(5), 4680, 4690, \n4697,4786. \nThe Lanterman Act pays special attention to the needs of \npeople who are dually diagnosed - meaning they have a psychiatric \ndisability as well as a developmental disability.  § 4646.  DDS is required to \nconsider, with the Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\"), higher rates for \nliving arrangements for the dually diagnosed.  § 4681(d).  And the \nLanterman Act mandates cooperative efforts between RCs and county \nmental health agencies.  § 4696.1 (c). \nIn addition to its general oversight and monitoring \nresponsibilities with respect to the entire Lanterman Act service system, \nDDS directly operates seven public institutions known as developmental \ncenters, which house approximately 3,000 Californians with developmental \ndisabilities.  DDS has primary responsibility, with participation by RCs, for \n10 \n\nconducting assessments and developing IPPs for developmental center \nresidents that meet the same requirements for assessments and IPPs that \napply to all other consumers under the Lanterman Act.  E.g., §§ 4440-4499. \nPederallaws and programs, such as the ADA and the \nMedicaid Act, also playa role in the system's structure.  The ADA \nregulations require a public entity to \"administer services, programs, and \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.\"  28 C.P.R. § 35. 130(d); see also 28 C.P.R. \n§41.51(d) (Section 504 regulations). \nMedicaid is a federal program jointly funded by federal and \nstate governments to provide health, rehabilitation, and other services to \nhelp low-income people attain or retain capability for independence and \nself-care.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq.  To receive federal funds, states must \ncomply with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and with the \nfederal regulations governing state Medicaid programs.  42 U.S.C. § 1396 \net seq., 42 C.P.R. § 430 et seq.  Pederallaw authorizes the \"waiver\" of \nsome federal rules so that a state can provide extra Medicaid services to a \ntargeted group of individuals who would otherwise receive care in an \ninstitution to receive services in their own homes or in home-like settings in \nthe community.  42 C.F.R. § 441.300.  California has several waiver \nprograms that apply to class members, including the Developmental \nDisabilities waiver.  42 U.S.C. § 1396(c)(1); 42 C.P.R. § 441.300.  These \n11 \n\nwaivers operate after federal approval. \nIn addition to DDS and the RCs, other state agencies -\nincluding those that are defendants in this action - have roles and \nresponsibilities in the provision of community-based services and supports \nto class members.  DMH, in collaboration with DDS and the RCs, is \nresponsible for ensuring that Californians with developmental disabilities \nwho also have psychiatric disabilities or mental health service needs receive \nneeded services and supports.  §§ 4510, 4681.1(d), 4691.1.  The \nDepartment of Health Services (\"DHS\") is the single state agency \nresponsible for administrating all aspects of the Medicaid program in \nCalifornia (\"Medi-Cal\"), which provides \"waiver\" services to encourage \nstates to assist people with disabilities, including people with \ndevelopmental disabilities, to avoid institutionalization.  42 U.S.c. \n§ 1396a(a)(5); § 14137.  DDS, DMH and DHS operate under the \nadministration and oversight of the California Health and Human Services \nAgency (\"CHHS\").  §§ 4400 et seq., 4415,4500 et seq.; Gov. Code \n§§ 12803(a), 12801, 12850, 12850.6, 12851, 12852.  California's \nDepartment of Finance (\"DOF\") is the department of the state with the \nauthority to approve, revise, alter or amend the budget of any state agency, \nincluding CHHS, DHS, DMH and DDS.  Gov. Code §§ 13291 et seq.  DOF \n12 \n\nalso has the authority to approve budget augmentations and has oversight \nresponsibility with respect to any regulation with a fiscal impact.5  Gov. \nCode §§ 13070, 13075, 13877. \n3.  Similarly common issues relating to Defendants' \npractices were previously resolved on a class-wide \nbasis in an earlier lawsuit where a settlement class \nwas certified. \nIn the early 1990s, DDS and certain other defendants in this \naction were sued for violating Californians' entitlement to community \ninclusion by failing to provide community living arrangements and \nancillary services and supports to developmental center residents whose \nplanning teams had recommended that they be moved to the community.  A \nstipulated class action settlement provided an effective remedy.  See Coffelt \net al. v. Dep't ofD  evelopmental Servo et al., (San Francisco Superior Court \nNo. 916401); 12JA3146-299, at 3275. \nAt that time, DDS maintained a wait list whereby 2,000 \npersons with developmental disabilities remained institutionalized in \ndevelopmental centers despite being recommended for community \nplacement.  Several institutionalized individuals and other interested parties \nbrought a class action against DDS and four Northern California RCs that \n5 Collectively, the State, DDS, DRS, DMR, DOF, and the Directors of \nthese agencies, CRRS and its Secretary, are jointly referred to as State \nDefendants. \n13 \n\nhad among the highest numbers of individuals placed in the DCs.  The \nlawsuit sought to enforce the Lanterman Act entitlement to live and receive \nservices and supports in the least restrictive settings.  Id.  In 1994, the \nCoffelt court approved a settlement agreement, including certification of a \nclass comprised of DC residents recommended for community placement. \nThe settlement required systems reforms and a net reduction of 2000 \nresidents in the DC population in California over a five-year period.  Id. \nDuring the five-year period of the Coffelt settlement, the DC population \ndeclined by 2,452 - approximately 490 individuals per year.  7JA1815-16. \nBut the trend of moving people from DCs to community \nsettings slowed after the Coffelt settlement period ended.  12JA3093.  In the \nsucceeding five years, from January 2000 to January 2005, the DC \npopulation declined by an average of only 131 persons per year.  7JA1815-\n16. \nDefendants have acknowledged that the decline in community \nplacements post-Coffelt was due to the fact that the motivation of the \nsettlement agreement no longer existed.  6JAI638-42; 7JA1678-79 & 1797-\n1800; 10JA2614 & 2619 (\"When the terms of the Coffelt consent decree \nwere met and scrutiny was removed, we saw the number of movers dwindle \nto a trickle.\").  Simply put by DDS Chief Deputy Director, Julie Jackson, \nthe \"pressure was off.\"  7JAI678-79. \nIt was this state of affairs that led to the filing of the instant \n14 \n\nlawsuit. \n4.  Defendants admit that most if not all of the more \nthan 7,600 individuals currently institutionalized \ncould live in less restrictive settings. \nThe proposed class definition includes not only people living \nin or at risk of placement in DCs, but also people living in or at risk of \nplacement in other public and private institutional settings.6  As of July \n2005, there were 3,133 Californians with developmental disabilities living \nin DCs and 4,642 living in non-DC institutions.  6JA1463-64 &1466. \nDefendants, themselves, acknowledge that the vast majority \n- if not all - of these institutionalized class members could live in less \nrestrictive settings with the appropriate supports and services: \n•  Julie Jackson, Acting Chief Deputy Director, DDS: \"I \nbelieve that it is possible to serve the majority of \npeople in the community if the appropriate resources \nare there and if the capacity of the community exists as \na general principle.\"  7JAI683-84. \n•  Julia Mullen, Deputy Director of Community Services \nand Supports Division, DDS: \"100%\" of \ndevelopmental center residents could live in the \ncommunity if they were provided with appropriate \nservices and supports.  12JA3137.  \"I agree ... that \n'even people with the most significant support \nchallenges can be and are served in non-institutional \nsettings.'\"  9JA2408(~ 12(e)). \nNon-developmental center institutions include skilled nursing facilities \n6 \n(\"SNFs\"), large intermediate care facilities (\"ICF-DDs\"), psychiatric and \nsub-acute care facilities, and other settings housing 16 or more persons \n(e.g., large community care facilities (\"CCFs\")).  12JAI086. \n15 \n\n•  Richard Jacobs, Executive Director of Valley \nMountain RC: \"We believe that everyone who is in the \n[developmental centers] can be served in a community \nsetting.\"  7JAI728-29. \n•  James Shorter, Executive Director of Tri-Counties RC: \n\"all of the approximately 125 people that reside at the \n[developmental centers] from the Tri-Counties area are \ncapable of living in the community successfully.\" \n7JAI751-54. \nThus, by their own admission, Defendants' systemic policies \nand practices fail to fulfill the integration mandate for the vast majority of \nclass members. \nDefendants have demonstrated the feasibility of moving the \nsubstantial majority of DC residents to less restrictive, community \nplacements when they focus their efforts and develop a systematic plan. \nFor example, the State Defendants and three RC Defendants have \ndeveloped a comprehensive plan for closing one DC (Agnews DC) and \nmoving 85% of the residents to the community.  7JA1691-92 & 1826-36. \nDDS's goal is to provide a range of community service options to meet the \nneeds of Agnews residents - the majority of whom have lived at Agnews \nfor over 20 years.  7JA1821 & 1826.  Yet, there are no plans to provide \nsimilar opportunities to comparable numbers of residents of the other DCs, \nnotwithstanding the acknowledged similarity of the populations served \n(7JAI682) and, of course, the equality of those consumers' rights under \nstate and federal law . \n16 \n\na.  Defendants' process for providing more \nintegrated options to residents of the State \nrun developmental centers fails to serve the \nmaj ority of those residents. \nThe Agnews closure plan was developed using the Lanterman \nAct \"community placement plan\" process, or CPP.  § 4418.25.  Through \nthe CPP, RCs receive funds to engage in activities to prevent DC placement \nand set annual goals and identify specific individuals for placement from \nDCs to the community.  Except for its application to the Agnews closure \nplan process, however, the CPP, as implemented by RC's and administered \nby DDS, is woefully inadequate in meeting the Lanterman Act's least \nrestrictive environment requirement and the requirements of other laws. \nDDS is responsible for establishing policies and procedures \nfor the development of annual CPPs by RCs.  § 4418.25(a).  Nonetheless, \nDDS has an essentially laissez fa ire policy with respect to RCs annual CPP \ngoals.  7JAI716-23.  The guidelines that DDS has developed for \nimplementing the CPP do not include even basic standards that require, for \nexample, that RCs set numerical goals that are related to the numbers of DC \nresidents whose needs could be met in a less restrictive setting and that \nwould enable all such individuals to move to a less restrictive setting within \na reasonable timeframe.  7JA1716.  As a result, even the lowest-performing \nRCs are not directed to increase the goals they set.  7JA1721 & 1737.  In \nfact, DDS's guidelines create incentives that encourage RCs to set low \n17 \n\nannual goals rather than incentives to encourage goals that would more \neffectively reduce unnecessary DC placements.  E.g.; 7JA1649-53 & 1712-\n16. \nAs a result, except for residents of Agnews DC, the chances \nof being selected for the CPP are quite small.  12JA3093-4.  For example, \nthe largest DC (Sonoma) - with a population of 754 as of August 31, 2005 \n(7JAI888) - places only about 20 people per year in the community. \n7JAI772.  At that rate, most Sonoma DC residents will likely not be on the \nCPP, let alone moved to the community, in their lifetimes.  That is \nparticularly troubling because Sonoma serves a population of persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities no more severe or challenging than those in the \nAgnews DC, where 85% of the population will have moved to the \ncommunity within the next two years.  7JA1682, 1826-36. \nb.  Defendants have completely failed to address \nthe community integration needs of residents \nin non-developmental center institutions. \nDCs are not the only institutional settings addressed by this \ncase.  Also at issue is whether Defendants are meeting their obligations \nunder the Lanterman Act, the ADA and other laws to provide services in \nthe least restrictive setting for the 4,462 class members who live in non-DC \ninstitutions.  Clearly they are not. \nThe right to live in integrated community settings applies \nequally to all people with developmental disabilities, not only to those in \n18 \n\ndevelopmental centers.  While the CPP applies only to people in DCs and \nthose at risk of DC placement, the CPP \"is not intended to limit [DDS's] or \nRCs' responsibility to otherwise conduct assessments and individualized \nprogram planning, and to provide needed services and supports in the least \nrestrictive, most integrated setting in accord with the [Lanterman Act].\" \n§ 4418.25(b).  Nonetheless, there is no systemic policy or plan whatsoever \nfor ensuring that people unnecessarily placed in non-DC institutions like \nnursing facilities, ICF-DDs, and large community care facilities, are \nprovided with opportunities to live in non-institutional settings within a \nreasonable timeframe. 7JAI698-99, 1701-04 & 1711; 10JA2616-17. \nB.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs filed suit on January 25,2002.  lJAOOOI-0076.  The \ncurrent operative pleading-the Fifth Amended Petition for Writ of \nMandate; Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief-was \nfiled on July 8, 2005.  4JA0936-1049.  The action was brought by three \norganizations, two individual taxpayers and 16 Californians with \ndevelopmental disabilities who are institutionalized or at risk of \ninstitutionalization, on behalf of themselves and approximately 7,775 \nsimilarly situated Californians.  The proposed class definition is:  All \nCalifornia residents with a developmental disability, as defined in Welfare \n19 \n\nand Institutions Code section 4512(b), who are (or become) \n7 \ninstitutionalized, and those who are at risks of being institutionalized, in \ncongregate residential facilities having a capacity of 16 or more individuals. \nThe causes of action assert violations of: (1) the Lanterman \nAct entitlement to the most integrated community living arrangements \nbased on individualized assessments; (2) California nondiscrimination laws, \nGovernment Code section 11135 and Welfare and Institutions Code section \n4502; (3) the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); (4) Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (5) the California Constitutional right to due \nprocess and equal protection, Article 1, section 1; (6) the U.S. \nConstitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to due process, First \nAmendment right to freedom of expression, and Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection; and (7) the Medicaid Act.  4JA0993-1036; \nUnder this definition, \"institutions\" include developmental centers and a \n7 \nvariety of other public and private facilities with a capacity of 16 or more. \n4JAI086. \nA person is \"at risk\" of institutionalization in a DC when \"the regional \n8 \ncenter determines, or is informed by the consumer's parents, legal guardian, \nconservator, or authorized representative that the community placement of \n[the] consumer is at risk of failing and that admittance to a state \ndevelopmental center is a likelihood.\"  § 4418.7.  In addition, individuals \nwho are released from developmental centers may be on provisional \nplacement for one year and have an \"automatic right of return.\"  § 4508. \nUnder the class definition persons at risk of institutionalization also include \nindividuals meeting the same criteria with respect to non-DC institutions. \n4JAI086. \n20 \n\n4JAI061.  In addition, Plaintiffs assert a claim against the RC Defendants \npursuant to Business & Professions Code section 17200, et seq., for \ninjunctive relief as a representative action on behalf of the general public. \nId.  The two individual taxpayer Plaintiffs have brought a claim for the \nillegal expenditure of taxpayer funds.  Id. \nOn January 28, 2003, the Superior Court granted a motion to \nintervene by eleven persons with developmental disabilities \ninstitutionalized in DCs, and two organizations, CASH/PCR and California \nAssociation for the Retarded, that claim a membership of family, friends, \nand conservators of persons with developmental disabilities \ninstitutionalized in DCs.  2JA0545-548.  The Court's order limited their \nintervention to \"ensur[ing] that the legal rights of parents and guardians to \nparticipate in the planning process and the ability of professionals to \nrecommend placement in development centers are not adversely affected by \nany judgment in this action.\"  Id. \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on February 18, \n2004.  2JA0567-569.  But, the Superior Court postponed the hearing on the \nmotion three times because State Defendants filed intervening motions and \nwrit petitions. \nOn April 30, 2004, this Court granted State Defendants' \npetition for writ of mandate seeking clarification on three inconsistent \nSuperior Court orders relating to Plaintiffs' Lanterman Act cause of action. \n21 \n\nThe Court also noted, however, that Plaintiffs could amend their \nComplaint.  4JA0911-18.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended \nComplaint (4JA0936-1 049), to which the State Defendants demurred as to \nPlaintiffs' Lanterman Act and Medicaid Act claims.  The demurrer was \ngranted in part and denied in part by the Superior Court by order of January \n6,2005.  State Defendants again sought review in the Court of Appeal by \npetition for writ of mandate.  On March 23, 2005, this Court denied State \nDefendants' writ petition.  4JA  0921. \nOn September 29,2005, Plaintiffs filed their renewed motion \nto certify a class of 7,775 people residing in institutions or at risk of \nplacement in institutions within one year of their discharge.  4JAI072-\n1074.  The Superior Court denied Plaintiffs' motion, resulting in this timely \nappeal.  14JA3606-22 & 3785-86.  The Superior Court subsequently issued \na \"wrap-around\" stay of all Superior Court proceedings to supplement the \nautomatic stay under Code of Civil Procedure § 916.  14JA3793-3811 \nIV.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Superior Court's Order is reviewed for an abuse of \ndiscretion and must be reversed if the Superior Court abused its discretion \nor based its decision upon (1) improper criteria, (2) erroneous legal \nassumptions, or (3) no substantial evidence.  See Linder, supra, 23 Ca1.4th \nat pp. 435-36; Bartold v. Glendale Fed. Bank (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 816, \n828.  Importantly, moreover, this Court must limit its review to the \n22 \n\nSuperior Court's stated reasons for the Order and must ignore any other \ngrounds that might support affirming the Order.  Bartold, supra, 81 \nCal.App.4th at p. 828; Linder, supra, 23 Ca1.4th at pp. 435-36.  Review in \nthis context thus \"presents an exception to the general rule that a reviewing \ncourt will look to the trial court's result, not its rationale.\"  Bartold, supra, \n81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 828-29. \nV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED BY FAILING \nTO APPLY THE STANDARD OF \nCOMMONALITY SET FORTH IN SA V-ON AND \nOTHER CALIFORNIA CASES. \nThe Superior Court held that Plaintiffs demonstrated, as in \nSav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at pp. 327-30, that the Defendants \"acted or \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.\"  14JA3614. \nThe Superior Court stated that \"a different result\" would have occurred -\nthat is, it would have found common issues predominated - if it had \nfollowed Sav-On and focused on Defendants' policies instead of the class \nmembers' individual claims.  Id.  The Superior Court was correct on this \npoint because California law requires as much.  The Court erred, however, \nby then turning its focus away from Defendants' policies and practices \ndespite having recognized that common practices are what is at issue in the \ncase. \n23 \n\n1.  The Superior Court was required to determine \ncommonality based on Plaintiffs' theory of recovery \nemphasizing Defendants' conduct. \nIn Sav-On, the plaintiffs emphasized the defendant's conduct \nby alleging liability based on the illegality of the defendant's policies and \npractices that applied uniformly to the class.  Id. at 328-29.  The defendant \nargued that no meaningful generalizations about the employment \ncircumstances could be made because liability depended upon individual \nproof of a multitude of factors that made up each class member's tasks and \nthe duration of time he or she spent on each task.  Id. at 325,328-29. \nThe California Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs' \"theory \nof recovery\" - as framed by the plaintiffs' allegations and declarations of \nlegal counsel- governed the court's ruling.  Id. at 327.  To hold otherwise, \nthe court noted, would constitute an impermissible adjudication of the \nmerits of the case.  Id. \nUnder the plaintiffs' theory of the recovery, the Sav-On court \ndescribed the predominant issue as whether the various tasks the class \nmembers engaged in should be classified as exempt or non-exempt.  Id. at \n330.  The court rejected the defendant's emphasis on the differences among \nclass members' circumstances and held that \"[p]laintiffs' theory does not \ndepend on class members having identical claims, nor does the law of class \ncertification require such.\" Id. at 338.  The court held that \"even if some \nindividualized proof of such facts ultimately is required to parse class \n24 \n\nmembers' claims, that such will predominate in the action does not \nnecessarily follow.\"  Id. at 334.  This accommodation of individual issues \nexists because commonality is a \"comparative concept.\"  Id. \nThe relative comparison lies between the costs and \nbenefits of adjudicating plaintiffs' claims in a class \naction and the costs and benefit of proceeding by \nnumerous separate actions-not between the \ncomplexity of a class suit that must accommodate \nsome individualized inquiries and the absence of any \nremedial proceeding what so ever. \nId. at 339 n.l O.  Accommodation of individualized inquiries has been \nencouraged by the California Supreme Court for decades.  Id. at 339. \nCourts recognize that subsidiary individual issues can be accommodated \njudicially, or are better suited for later proceedings or administrative \nproceedings after a determination of the legality of the defendants' conduct. \nSee, e.g., Employment Dev. Dep't v. Superior Court (1981) 30 Ca1.3d 256, \n266  (\"a court can devise remedial procedures which channel the individual \ndeterminations that need to be made through existing administrative \nforums.\"). \nSimilar to Sav-On, in Alch v. Superior Court (2004) 122 \nCal.App.4th 339,350,378, the court held that a group of screen writers \nproperly pled \"a systemwide policy or practice of age discrimination\" \nthroughout the entire television industry without pleading individual claims \nor discrete wrongs.  The court considered 23 separate class action lawsuits \nfiled by hundreds of television writers against 12 different groups of related \n25 \n\ntelevision networks, studios and production companies (\"employers\"), and \n11 talent agencies.  Id.  The writers challenged the industry's openly \ndiscriminatory employment practices as well as \"facially neutral\" \ndiscriminatory practices such as the employers' failure to use defined \ncriteria to evaluate applicants, using word of mouth and nepotistic hiring \npractices, and refusing to accept script submissions except through talent \nagents, that facilitated the discriminatory practices.  Id. at 353-55.  The \nwriters alleged injury in that the systemic discrimination deterred them \nfrom seeking employment or caused their rejection for employment \nopportunities.  Id. at 350. \nThe Alch defendants contended that the conduct alleged \nconsisted of \"multiple, discrete acts\" each being \"an adverse act that \nconstitutes a single unlawful practice.\" Id. at 378.  Alch rejected this \napproach.  The court clarified that under the defendants' \"discrete acts\" \napproach \"every plaintiff in a class action would be required to plead facts \nsupporting an individual prima facie case of discriminatory refusal to hire \n.... No such rule oflaw exists.\"  Id.  \"These are classwide claims of \nsystemic discrimination, where the writers' ultimate evidentiary burden is \nto prove that age discrimination was the employers' standard operating \nprocedure.\"  Id. at 382.  \"Plaintiffs in a class action need not prove each \nclass plaintiff was a victim of discrimination; they must prove the existence \nof a discriminatory policy and, if they do so, they are entitled to classwide \n26 \n\nrelief.\"  Id. at 380-81. \nAlch recognized that individual relief issues were separate \nand distinct from the issue of the illegality of the defendants' conduct: \nthe question whether a deterred applicant will be \nable to obtain individual relief is a different \nquestion, and one that will not arise until and unless \nthe writers prove the employers have enforced a \ncompanywide policy of discrimination.  If the \nwriters are able to do so, they will be entitled to \ninjunctive and perhaps other classwide relief.  It is \nonly at this point that individual claims of class \nmembers become germane. \nId. at 383. \nIn Reyes v. Bd. ofS upervisors (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1263,1277, a \ngovernment benefits case, the court held that the common goal of the class, \nwhich was to change the defendant's conduct, was sufficient to establish \ncommonality.  The Reyes court rebuked the defendants' assertion that, even \nif they had a common duty to all class members, proof of whether they did \nin fact improperly administer the subject program depended entirely on the \nfacts of each individual case.  Id. at 1279. \nThese cases exhibit that it is proper under California law to \nlook to the defendant's common conduct for purposes of class treatment \nand for liability.  Indeed, this approach is particularly appropriate in cases \nwhere only systemic injunctive relief is sought.  In Mendoza v. County of \nTulare (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 403,416-18, a prisoners' rights case, the \ncourt rejected the defendants' argument that \"each prisoner's right to relief \n27 \n\nin this case depends on 'facts peculiar to his case,' thus amounting to a \nmere aggregation of individual claims.\"  The court held that the plaintiffs \ncould focus on the defendants' policies and practices without proving \nindividual facts. \nAppellants' claims could focus primarily on \nrespondents' actions or omissions, and the \nsimilarly situated class members would not be \nrequired to prove individual facts.  If the Court \nultimately finds statutory or constitutional \nviolations, declaratory and injunctive relief will lie \nto redress violations common to the class even \nthough some apply only to individuals. \nId. at 418.  The court recognized that because the plaintiffs had not sought \nmoney damages, individual relief issues and two cases denying class \ntreatment based on individual relief issues did not bar class treatment.  Id. \n2.  Plaintiffs' theory of recovery is indistinguishable \nfrom those held sufficient under California law. \nAkin to the plaintiffs' challenges to the defendants' practices \nin Sav-On, Alch, and the other cases above, Plaintiffs' allege - i.e. their \n\"theory of recovery\" - that Defendants, through their common policies \nand practices, acts and omissions, have prevented class members from \nreceiving the appropriate assessments, supports and services needed to live \nin non-institutional settings.  4JA0942-43, 0978-1036 &  1043-49.  Without \naccess to such assessments, supports and services, these class members \nremain unnecessarily institutionalized in violation of their rights under the \nLanterman Act, Government Code Section 11135, the ADA, the Medicaid \n28 \n\nAct and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and their statutory and \nconstitutional rights of freedom, liberty, association, privacy, and equal \nprotection.  Id; 4JA1061-1072; lOJA2638. To remedy these violations, \nPlaintiffs prayed for systemic mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief \nonly.  4JAI036-42. \nIn their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs set out the \nfollowingJactual issues as common to the class: \n•  Whether Defendants fail to properly conduct \nindividualized assessments by qualified professionals that \nare sufficiently person-centered and comprehensive to \ndetermine the community-based services class members \nwant and need to end or to prevent unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. \n•  Whether Defendants fail to provide or ensure the \ndevelopment of community-based services and placement \noptions sufficient to enable all class members for whom \ninstitutionalization is not necessary to actually receive the \nservices to which they are entitled in a timely manner. \n•  Whether Defendants have failed to meet their oversight \nand monitoring responsibilities to prevent violations of \nclass members' rights under state and federal law, \nincluding oversight and monitoring of DDS by CRRS and \noversight of RCs by DDS. \n4J Al 076-1077.  In their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs set out the \nfollowing legal issues as common to the class: \n•  Whether Defendants' policies and practices violate class \nmembers' rights under the Lanterman Act, Government \nCode section 11135, the ADA, the Medicaid Act and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to avoid \nunnecessary institutionalization and receive services in the \nleast restrictive, most integrated setting consistent with \n29 \n\ntheir needs ~md choices. \n•  Whether Defendants' policies and procedures resulting in \nactual or potential unnecessary institutionalization violate \nor place at risk class members' constitutional rights, \nincluding the rights to equal protection, liberty, privacy, \nand freedom of association. \n•  Whether RCs' violations of these statutory and \nconstitutional rights also violate Business and Professions \nCode section 17200. \n4JAI076-1077.  Based on these allegations and others, the Superior Court \nheld that Plaintiffs had demonstrated, as in Sav-On, that Defendants \"acted \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.\"  14JA3614. \nBut the Superior Court then turned its back on its own holding when it \nerroneously applied a different legal standard. \n3.  The Superior Court's erroneous assumptions and \n\"discrete wrongs\" approach amount to improper \ncriteria. \na.  The Superior Court erred in applying the \n\"discrete wrongs\" approach and holding that \nsystemic violations did not create common \nissues. \nThe Superior Court should have stopped after finding that \nPlaintiffs established commonality under Sav-On.  But, instead, the \nSuperior Court disregarded Sav-On and followed its own \"discrete wrongs\" \napproach based on erroneous legal assumptions contradicting California \nlaw.  Under the \"discrete wrongs\" approach, the Superior Court failed to \nconsider Plaintiffs' allegations concerning Defendants' common conduct. \nInstead, it focused on individual issues, such as the individual class \n30 \n\nmembers' placements and the individualized content in each of their IPPs. \n14JA361O-11, 3612-14 & 3619.  Following this approach was reversible \nerror. \nAs the basis for its \"discrete wrongs\" approach, the Superior \nCourt erroneously followedJB. by Hart v.  Valdez (loth Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d \n1280, 1289 (\"JB.\") for the propositions that \"an allegation of systemic \nfailures does not create a common legal issue.\"  14JA3610.  That \nproposition is contrary to California law.  Each of the cases described in \nSection V.A.l above based its commonality finding on the central issue of \nthe illegality of the defendants' common systemic conduct.  Indeed, Sav-On \nheld that \"[p]  I aintiffs ' theory does not depend on class members having \nidentical claims, nor does the law of class certification require such.\"  Id. at \n338. The Superior Court committed reversible error by following the \nholding of a case from the Tenth Circuit rather than established California \nlaw. \nThe \"discrete wrongs\" approach is irreconcilable with Alch, \nsupra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 382, in which the Court of Appeal held that \nunder the defendants' \"discrete acts\" approach \"every plaintiff in a class \naction would be required to plead facts supporting an individual prima facie \ncase of discriminatory refusal to hire .... No such rule oflaw exists.\" \nRather, classwide claims require the plaintiffs to establish that \ndiscrimination was the defendants' \"standard operating procedure.\"  Id. at \n31 \n\n382.  \"Plaintiffs in a class action need not prove each class plaintiff was a \nvictim of discrimination; they must prove the existence of a discriminatory \npolicy and, if they do so, they are entitled to classwide relief.\"  Id. at 380-\n81. \nAs discussed above, under Plaintiffs' theory of recovery the \nillegality of Defendants' systemic policies and practices and the systemic \neffect thereof are the central issues in the case.  4JA0942-43, 0978-1036 & \n1043-49.  Each Plaintiff need not plead facts supporting individual \nentitlement claims which have not been alleged, are not prayed for, and are \nbetter suited for post-judgment determination by the proper administrative \nprocesses.  6JA1500; 14JA3607-08; Sav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at p. 338; \nMendoza, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 416-18 (recognizing subsidiary \nnature of individual issues when only injunctive relief sought). \nThe Superior Court also wrongly assumed JB. 's disallowance \nof the aggregate approach to the plaintiffs' legal claims was consistent with \nCalifornia law.  14JA3610.  The Superior Court erred because California \ncourts routinely aggregate claims when deciding whether or not to certify a \nclass action.  See, e.g., Sav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at p. 324 (aggregating \nalleged violations of overtime statutes and California's unfair competition \nlaw, as well as conversion, for which plaintiffs sought damages and \ninjunctive and declaratory relief); Employment Dev. Dept., supra, 30 Ca1.3d \nat p. 265 (aggregating alleged violations of Title VII, equal protection and \n32 \n\ndue process clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, \nwhere declaratory and injunctive relief were sought as well as a writ of \nmandate to compel retroactive benefits); Richmond supra 29 Ca1.3d at p. \n462 n.3 (aggregating violations of section 11010 and 11025 of the Business \nand Professions Code, as well as common law fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, failure of consideration, unjust enrichment, breach of \ntrust, and seeking declaratory relief and rescission); Gonzales v. Jones \n(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 978, 984 (aggregating numerous federal and state \nconstitutional grounds seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as \nmandate); Mendoza, supra, 128 Ca1.App.3d at pp. 414,417 (rejecting \ndefendants' argument that plaintiffs' aggregate right to relief based on ten \ncauses of action amounted to a \"mere aggregation\" of individual claims). \nThus, the Superior Court's sole purpose for relying on J.B. was misplaced. \nThe Superior Court's citation to Hicks v. Kaufman & Broad \nHome Corp. (2001) 89 Ca1.AppAth 908 adds nothing to its \"discrete \nwrongs\" approach.  14JA3612.  The Superior Court initially cited Hicks for \nthe proposition that \"[ c ]lass certification is determined with reference to the \nclaims asserted and the court may take into account whether a class is \nappropriate for each claim.\"  14JA3609.  But, this citation is inapposite. \nThe Superior Court did not analyze any of Plaintiffs' legal claims or specify \nwhy any particular claim lacked commonality.  The Superior Court instead \ntook a collective approach based solely on its assumptions that neither \n33 \n\ncommonality based on systemic violations nor claim aggregation were \nappropriate.  Thus, by citing Hicks, the Superior Court implies that \nPlaintiffs' legal claims are prevented from class treatment by J.B. ' s \nholding.  14JA3610.  The Hicks citation is intertwined with the erroneous \nassumption regarding J.B. - and neither case prevents class treatment. \nIn fact, Hicks supports class treatment of Plaintiffs' claims. \nHicks held that \"[a]s a general rule, if the defendants' liability can be \ndetermined by facts common to all members of the class, a class will be \ncertified even if the members must individually prove their damages.\" \nHicks, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at p. 916.  Having found Plaintiffs met the \nSav-On standard, which is akin to the Hicks standard above, the Superior \nCourt's only substantive reason for denying class treatment was its \nmisplaced reliance on J.B.  Hicks is inapposite. \nb.  The Superior Court's use of the \"discrete \nwrongs\" approach is also inconsistent with \nthe Ninth Circuit and federal majority view. \nThe proposition in J.B. the Superior Court relied on has been \nrejected by most federal courts.  Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey (3d \nCir. 1996) 43 F.3d 48 (\"Baby Neal\") - consistent with Sav-On and \nMendoza - held that the differences among the plaintiffs were \"largely \nirrelevant\" in light of the nature of the systemic injunctive relief sought and \nthe defendant's common course of conduct towards the plaintiffs.  Id. at 57. \nThe court noted that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b )(2) classes \"have \n34 \n\nbeen certified in a legion of civil rights cases where commonality findings \nwere based primarily on the fact that defendant's conduct is central to the \nclaims of all class members irrespective of the individualized circumstances \nand the disparate effects of the conduct.\"  Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. \n57.  Baby Neal represents the majority rule. \nThe Second Circuit adopted Baby Neal in a civil rights action \nbrought by children against the New York City child welfare system.  See \nMarisol A. v. Giuliani (2d Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d 372, 375-76.  In Marisol A., \nthe defendants emphasized the plaintiffs' individuality, arguing that each \nplaintiff challenged a different aspect of the welfare system, thus \nimplicating different statutory, constitutional and regulatory schemes.  Id. at \n367-77.  In other words, the court found that no one single legal claim \naffected all class members and no single class member was affected by \neach alleged legal violation.  Id.  The plaintiffs, by contrast, alleged that \ntheir injuries derived from a unitary course of conduct in a single welfare \nsystem, which the lower court found subject to a single regulatory scheme \nfor delivering child welfare services.  Id. at 377.  The court affirmed the \nlower court's certification of the class holding that the plaintiffs' class \nclaims were sufficiently related for certification and noting that Baby Neal \nholds that it is an abuse of discretion to hold otherwise.  Id. \nThe Ninth Circuit relied on both Baby Neal and Marisol A. in \na case involving prisoner's rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \n35 \n\nAct.  See Armstrong v. Davis (9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d 849, 867-69.  In \nArmstrong, the defendant argued that the variations in class members' \ndisabilities precluded a finding of commonality.  Id.  Rejecting the \ndefendant's argument, the court held that it was sufficient that all of the \nclass members suffered from the defendant's failure to accommodate their \ndisabilities although there was \"a wide variation in the nature of the \nparticular class members' disabilities.\"  Id.  The court reaffirmed the Ninth \nCircuit's approach \"that commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit \nchallenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative \nclass members.\"  Id. at 668 (citations omitted).  \"In such a circumstance, \nindividual factual differences among the individual litigants or groups of \nlitigants will not preclude a finding of commonality.\"  Id. at 688 (citing \nBaby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 56.) \nBaby Neal is consistent with California law and is the law in \nthe Second, Third, and Ninth circuits, while J.B. is inconsistent with \nCalifornia law and remains an outlier as a matter of federal law . The \nSuperior Court erred by failing to follow established California law and \nthen compounded that error by relying on J.B. \nc.  By following the \"discrete wrongs\" approach \ninstead of Plaintiffs' theory of recovery, the \nSuperior Court contravened Sav-On. \nErroneously concluding that systemic violations were \ninsufficient to establish commonality, it appears the Superior Court was \n36 \n\nunable to reconcile Plaintiffs' theory of recovery and proffered methods of \nproof with the individualized nature of IPP assessments and placements. \n14JA3610-14, 3616, & 3618.  Based onJB. and against Sav-On, the \nSuperior Court disregarded both Plaintiffs' theory of recovery and its \nevidence.  Thereafter, the Superior Court analyzed class certification using \nits own theory of recovery:  \"the Court will not permit Plaintiffs to proceed \non a 'super-claim' alleging that the DDS/Regional Center system is broken \nbecause it consistently fails to place persons in the least restrictive setting. \nThe Court will ... require Plaintiffs to identify common discrete wrongs \nthat affect the individual class members.\"  14JA3612. \nThis substitution of the Superior Court's \"discrete wrongs\" \napproach instead of Plaintiffs' theory of recovery - evidenced by the \nSuperior Court's wholesale disregard of Plaintiffs' commonality arguments \nand evidence - was irreconcilable with Sav-On's instruction to follow the \nplaintiffs theory of recovery to avoid an adjudication of the merits of the \ncase.  Sav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at p. 327; see also Linder, supra, 23 \nCa1.4th at pp. 443-44. \nMoreover, the Superior Court's approach to Plaintiffs' \ncommonality showing exposes the Superior Court's flawed approach and \nimproper focus on individual issues.  The Superior Court cited only five \n\"discrete alleged wrongs\" to determine commonality.  14JA3612-14.  But, \ninstead of citing to and discussing the common factual and legal issues \n37 \n\nPlaintiffs identified in their brief, the Superior Court based its discussion on \na list of facts and evidence that Plaintiffs had offered to illustrate typicality. \n4JAI080.  The evidence submitted for typicality consisted of declarations \nby Plaintiffs and their guardians ad litem, while Plaintiffs supported their \ncommonality arguments with testimony of Defendants' staff and expert \ntestimony.  4JAI078-1080.  Compare 4JA1062-77 with 4JAI078-1080. \nAlthough the Superior Court found that typicality existed, it \nused Plaintiffs' inapposite typicality examples to hold that, under its theory \nof \"discrete wrongs,\" common issues did not predominate.  14JA3612-14. \nNowhere in its Order did the Superior Court cite to or analyze Plaintiffs' \ncommonality arguments or other examples of common issues of fact and \nlaw.  Id. \nFor each typicality example, the Superior Court found class \ntreatment improper because the \"discrete wrong\" would - in its opinion \ndepend solely upon the individualized IPP assessment of the class member. \nId.  For example, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants base IPP \nrecommendations on factors unrelated to the class members' needs and \nchoices in violation of § 4501 and § 4502.  4JA1080.  The Superior Court \nfound that \"the evidence suggests\" that Plaintiffs are right.  14JA3613. \nBut, rather than stopping at Defendants' improper conduct, the Superior \nCourt pondered the different types of improper factors that could apply in \neach class member's assessment.  Id.  This and the other four examples of \n38 \n\nthe Superior Court's approach to this case expose its dogged focus on \nsubsidiary individual issues.  The Superior Court erred in thinking it would \nhave to look at each class member's IPP at the expense of the central \ncommon issues of Defendants' policies and practices that lead, inter alia, to \ndeficient assessments and IPPs for all class members.  The Superior Court's \nindividualized focus was its principal legal error that doomed Plaintiffs' \nmotion, an error that would have been avoided if the Superior Court had \njust rested on its conclusion that Defendants' common practices are \nsufficient for commonality under Sav-On.  14JA3612-14. \n4.  The Superior Court erred by rejecting Plaintiffs' \npattern and practice evidence. \nBy relying solely on Plaintiffs' typicality examples, the \nSuperior Court applied improper criteria when it disregarded Plaintiffs' \npattern and practice evidence - methods of proof well-supported by \nCalifornia law. \nIn Sav-On, the plaintiffs proffered pattern and practice \nevidence of the defendant's policies and practices and the common effects \nof those policies and practices using documents, deposition testimony of \nthe most knowledgeable staff of defendants, discovery responses, and \ndeclarations.  34 Ca1.4th at 328-29.  The court quickly dismissed the \ndefendant's argument that the plaintiffs' pattern and practice evidence was \ninsufficient and irrelevant: \n39 \n\nCalifornia courts and others have in a wide variety of \ncontexts considered pattern and practice evidence, \nstatistical evidence, sampling evidence, expert \ntestimony, and other indicators of defendants' \ncentralized practices in order to evaluate whether \ncommon behavior towards similarly situated \nplaintiffs make class certification appropriate. \nId.  at 333 n.6; see also Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2004) 115 Cal. \nApp.4th 715, 750 (characterizing statistical sampling as \"a different method \nof proof' and \"a particular form of expert testimony\"). \nTime and time again, as in Sav-On, California courts have \ncertified classes where the plaintiffs' theory of recovery emphasized the \ndefendants' illegal conduct common to and affecting a large set of class \nmembers.  Courts have done so because such claims are provable on a \ncommon basis through pattern and practice evidence, including anecdotal \nevidence and statistical sampling.  See Employment Dev. Dep't, supra, 30 \nCal.3d at pp. 265-66 (\"a class action is a 'peculiarly appropriate' vehicle for \nproviding effective relief when, as here, a large number of applicants or \nrecipients have been improperly denied governmental benefits on the basis \nof an invalid regulation, statute or administrative practice.\"); Alch, supra, \n112 Cal.App.4th at p. 379 (\"[A] class action is, by definition, a pattern or \npractice claim.\"); Reyes, supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279 (proof can be \nbased on \"sampling of representative cases\" combined with testimony from \nknowledgeable witnesses). \nIn Alch, the writers proffered public statements, statistics and \n40 \n\nanecdotal evidence as evidence of the alleged age discrimination of the \nemployers and the talent agencies.  Id. at 352-53,355. Alch found this \nevidence sufficient:  \"[p] laintiffs normally seek to establish a pattern and \npractice of discriminatory intent by combining statistical and nonstatistical \nevidence, the latter most commonly consisting of anecdotal evidence of \nindividual instances of discriminatory treatment.\"  Id. at 380-81. \na.  Consistent with California law, Plaintiffs \nproffered common proof of the deficiencies \nin Defendants' policies and practices that \ncause unnecessary institutionalization. \nDefendants' systemic policies and practices and the systemic \neffect thereof are the central issues in the case - not individualized needs \nor entitlement issues.  4JA0942-43 & 0978-1036; 10JA2638; 4JAI074-\n1078. \nSimilar to Sav-On, Alch, Reyes, and Mendoza, Plaintiffs \ndemonstrated that these central issues are provable by common means. \nPlaintiffs submitted primarily pattern and practice evidence consisting of \ntestimony from Defendants about their policies and practices, admissions, \ndocuments, expert testimony, sampling and other evidence.  US0042-238; \n4JAI095-1101; 5JAII02-1355; 6JA1356-1500 & 1547-1644; 7JA1645-\n1927; lUA2719-3011; 12JA3012-3306; RT 48:9-51:11.  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs described their intended use of statistics and further sampling for \ntrial.  12JA3097-3100; RT 50: 13-51: 11. \n41 \n\nBecause the Superior Court found Defendants' conduct \ncommon to the class, it should have relied upon, instead of disregarding, \nthis proffered evidence.  Such reliance would necessarily have established a \nfinding that the alleged systemic violations could be proved without \nindividualized inquiries, and thus the Superior Court should have granted \nclass certification. \n(i)  Plaintiffs proffered common evidence \nof the common factual issues alleged. \nPlaintiffs proffered common evidence that Defendants \ncommon practices and policies result in a legally insufficient assessment \nprocess and thus, improper assessments.  For example, Plaintiffs proffered \nexpert testimony and testimony from Defendants' representatives that \nDefendants: \n•  Fail to conduct comprehensive assessments for class members \nwho have not been selected for the CPP.  6JA 1472-73 & 1601-\n02. \n•  Base placement recommendations on improper criteria - such \nas the availability of services - or fail to recommend \ncommunity placement based solely on a family member's \nobjection.  See §§ 4501, 4502 & 4646.5; Richard S. v. Dep't of \nDevelopmental Servs., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22750 *29 (C.D. \nCal. 2000) (enjoining DDS policy of giving parents, conservators \nand other legal representatives of DC residents unilateral veto \nauthority over IPP team recommendations), rev'd on other \ngrounds, (9th Cir. 2003) 317 F.3d 1080; 6JA1571, 1575-76 & \n1625-26; 7JA1655-63, 1764-69 & 1791-94. \n•  Fail to provide sufficient or understandable information about \nservice opportunities in the community to enable informed \nchoices.  See § 4502.1; 42 U.S.c. § 1396n(c)(2)(C), (d)(2)(C); 42 \n42 \n\nC.F.R. § 441.302(d)(I); 6JA1576-77 & 1584-87. \n•  Fail to ensure regional center attendance at developmental center \nIPP meetings (see §§ 4512(j) & 4646(d)), thereby limiting the \nIPP team's knowledge of available community services and \nsupports.  6JAI572-74; 7JAI654-55, 1761-63 & 1782. \nPlaintiffs proffered common evidence that Defendants fail to \nprovide or ensure the development of community-based services and \nplacements.  For example, Plaintiffs proffered expert testimony and \ntestimony from Defendants that Defendants fail to comply with Plaintiffs' \nlegal rights under state and federal law to live in an integrated settings in \nthe least restrictive environment because they: \n•  Fail to ensure timely provision of less restrictive community \nservices because, in part, they fail to keep wait lists of persons \nreferred to less restrictive settings.  See 7JA1700 &  1774-76. \n•  Fail to ensure the development of community services and \nsupports adequate to meet the needs of individuals who could be \nserved in the community because, in part, they fail to collect \nsystem-wide data on gaps in available services.  See 7JA1705-07 \n& 1779-80 \n•  Fail to develop sufficient resources and equitable systems of \npayments to establish needed services as required by §§ 4612(b), \n4648(a)(5), 4680, 4681(d), 4690, 4697, 4786; 6JA1472, 1578-\n1583, 1590-1599, 1611-23 & 1627-35; 7JAI670-72, 1738-41, \n1744-45 & 1787-90. \n•  Fail to assess, move and deflect individuals from non-DC \ninstitutions because, in part, there is no plan comparable to the \nCPP for these class members.  See 7JAI664-65, 1702-04 & \n1730-34. \nPlaintiffs proffered common evidence - testimony of DDS's \nChief Deputy Director - that State Defendants have not met their \n43 \n\noversight and monitoring responsibilities to prevent violations of class \nmembers' rights under state and federal law.  For example, DDS: \n•  Fails to establish policies governing the CPP that set standards \nfor RCs community placement plans in accord with the CPP \nrequirements.  See § 4418.25; 7 JA1716. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs described their intent to submit \nsampling and statistical evidence to establish the merits of their \ncontentions, such as the Defendants' failure \"to inform\" consumers and \ntheir family members of alternatives to institutionalization, or \"often\" base \nIPP recommendations on improper factors.  12JA3098-99.  As Plaintiffs' \ncounsel explained regarding Defendants' failure to perform comprehensive \nassessments:  \"Statistical sampling of individual records might be some of \nthe evidence that we would submit to confirm and corroborate that claim, \nbut the reason that we know that that claim is accurate is that it's been \ntestified to.\"  RT at 26:17-27:3 & 50:13-51:11. \nPlaintiffs' proffered methods of proof are typical of pattern \nand practice claims and are supported by California case law. \n(ii)  Both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' \nproffered common evidence on the \nillegality of Defendants' conduct. \nBecause Plaintiffs have shown that the deficiencies in \nDefendants policies and practices are provable on a common basis, \nPlaintiffs need only demonstrate that these deficiencies are illegal. \nPlaintiffs have established this illegality with common proof.  12JA3089. \n44 \n\nPlaintiffs used DDS, Regional Center and expert testimony to demonstrate \nthat the vast majority - if not all - of the class members are unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized because they could live in less restrictive settings with \nappropriate supports and services.  4JAI064.  Both Plaintiffs' and State \nDefendants' experts agreed on this point.  12JA3089. \nPlaintiffs put these and other systemic deficiencies into \ncontext for the Superior Court by exposing the fact that Defendants are \ncapable of moving scores of individuals into community settings, but have \nnot done so because they lack the motivation.  6JAI638-42; 7JA1678-79 & \n1797-1800; 10JA2614 & 2619.  Plaintiffs used statistics to show that the \nCoffelt settlement effectuated a net decrease in the DC population of 490 \npersons per year.  7JAI815-16; 12JA3093.  After the Coffelt settlement \nperiod ended, \"the pressure was off' and DDS and the RCs lacked the \nmotivation to continue the pace of community placements; thus, the net \ndecrease dropped to 131 persons per year.  6JAI638-42; 7JAI678-79, \n1797-1800 & 1815-16; 10JA2614 & 2619. \nExpert testimony submitted to the Superior Court confirms \nthat the legality of Defendants' conduct will be based on issues and proof \ncommon to all class members.  In a sweeping class-wide generalization, the \nState Defendants submitted expert testimony from Julia Mullen, a DDS \nDeputy Director, explaining that one reason for the decreased pace of \ncommunity placements after the Coffelt settlement period was that the \n45 \n\nindividuals remaining in institutions after Coffelt are the most difficult to \nserve.  9JA2406.  Ms. Mullen also asserted that Defendants' system-wide \nCommunity Placement Plan is sufficient to address the issue of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.  9JA2402-05 & 2409-10. \nPlaintiffs' expert, Lyn Rucker, disagreed, pointing out that \nMs Mullen's statement regarding individuals remaining institutionalized \nafter Coffelt contradicts her other generalization that all institutionalized \n9 \nindividuals could live in the community.  12JA3093-95. Furthermore, the \nfact that the Defendants are working contemporaneously to place into \ncommunity settings 85% of the Agnews DC population - the majority \nhaving resided there for over two decades and having a multitude of severe \ndisabilities - hollows Ms Mullen's explanation.  fd; 7JA1821 &  1826; RT \n20:7-21: 1148:13-49:25.  Ms Rucker also exposes the false promise of the \nCpp because under its current pace the majority of people currently \ninstitutionalized will need to wait for decades for an opportunity for \ncommunity placement.  12JA3093 & 3096-97.  These issues do not involve \nthe type of individual factors that the Superior Court erroneously assumed \nwere central to this case. \nMs. Rucker has extensive experience, nationally and internationally, as an \n9 \nadministrator, consultant and federal court monitor on issues of systems \nplanning and implementation of community services and supports for \npeople with developmental disabilities.  6JA1475-86. \n46 \n\nb.  The Superior Court erred by ignoring \nPlaintiffs' proffered methods of proof and \nmisconstruing Plaintiffs' examples of \ntypicality . \nBy disregarding Plaintiffs' standard evidentiary methods for \nproving systemic conduct, the Superior Court committed reversible error. \nCalifornia law promotes establishing liability and class treatment in \nsystemic violation cases through pattern and practice evidence, including \nthe statistical and anecdotal evidence explicitly rejected by the Superior \nCourt.  14JA3612 & 3619.  Indeed, courts have recognized that pattern and \npractice evidence is essential to balancing issues central to the case, while \nsubsidiary issues concerning subjective individual determinations are best \nleft to administrative processes, such as the content of IPPs.  See Lynn v. \nRegents ofUniv. of Cal. (9th Cir. 1981) 656 F.2d 1337,1343 & n.3 \n(explaining that reliance on statistical proof is practical and matter of \n\"sound policy\"); see also Gonzales, supra, 116 Cal.App.3d at p. 985. \nWhen the Superior Court focused its analysis on Plaintiffs' \ntypicality examples and the anecdotal evidence proffered in connection \nwith them, it disregarded Plaintiffs' proffered evidence using standard \nmethods of proving pattern and practice.  14JA3612-14.  It did not cite an \nevidentiary or legal basis for doing so.  The Superior Court explicitly \nignored Plaintiffs' statistical and sampling evidence even though such \nevidence would largely eliminate any need to focus on individual matters. \n47 \n\nc.  The Superior Court erred by disregarding \nPlaintiffs' intended statistics and sampling \nevidence under the guise of manageability. \nTo the extent the Superior Court's \"serious questions\" about \nPlaintiffs' anecdotal and statistical evidence were based on manageability \nconcerns, the Superior Court erred because such concerns provide no basis \nfor denying a motion for class certification \"unless manageability of the \nclass action is essentially without dispute or clearly established.\"  Reyes, \nsupra, 196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1275; cf Lazar v. Hertz Corp. (1983) 143 \nCal.App.3d 128, 140  (potential problems in discovery, trial, individualized \ndamages of class members are not fatal to class certification).  The Superior \nCourt did not (and could not) cite to any authority for an across the board \nconclusion that statistics and sampling evidence would be unmanageable. \nThat sampling is unmanageable is not established. 12JA3097-3100.  To the \ncontrary, Plaintiffs' expert, Ms. Rucker declared that sampling would be \nappropriate in this case, and in fact, the State itself relies upon sampling in \nmany contexts for monitoring and evaluation purposes, including sample \nIPP reviews.  12JA3097-3100.  To the extent that the Superior Court \nconsidered unmanageability of Plaintiffs' evidence to be a reason for \ndenying class certification, it abused its discretion in doing so. \n*  *  * \nIn sum, after finding commonality existed under Sav-On, the \nSuperior Court disregarded Plaintiffs' theory of recovery, commonality \n48 \n\narguments and methods of proof in order to deny class certification.  The \nSuperior Court erred as a matter of law and its ruling cannot stand. \nB.  THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nCLASS CERTIFICATION BASED ON INTERVENORS' \nOBJECTIONS. \nThe Superior Court held that the Plaintiffs did not establish \nthat they - as opposed to their counsel- adequately represented the class \nbecause a handful of class members - all of whom had been given leave to \nintervene in the case - opposed Plaintiffs' motion.  14JA3615-17 & 3619. \nThe Superior Court's holding cannot be reconciled with the California \nSupreme Court's decision in Richmond, supra, 29 Ca1.3d at p. 479, and \nthus must be reversed. \n1.  The Superior Court erred because courts cannot \ndeny class certification based on opposition from a \nhandful of class members. \nIn Richmond, 242 lot owners sued the developer of their \nsubdivision for fraud and other statutory violations based on the \ndeveloper's failure to plan for an adequate water supply and other \namenities.  ld. at 466.  The Tahoe Donner Association, which included all \nof the approximately 2,000 lot owners in the subdivision as members, \nintervened and opposed the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class consisting of \nall lot owners.  ld. at 467.  The Tahoe Donner Association relied upon a \nsurvey indicating that at least 266 of the lot owners - or 13.3 % of the class \n- were pleased with the defendant's work and the subdivision's status.  ld. \n49 \n\nat 468.  The trial court relied primarily upon this survey to deny the motion. \nId. at 465.  The Supreme Court reversed, noting that whenever a minority \nof class members oppose class certification the trial court should - at most \n- allow the minority to intervene or form a subclass to protect their \ninterests and similar interests of absent class members.  Id. at 474.  The \nSupreme Court squarely held that \"class certifications should not be denied \nso long as the absent class members' rights are adequately protected.\" Id; \nsee also Fanucchi v. Coberly -West Co. (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 72,82-83 \n(reversing order denying motion for class certification where 113 of the \nproposed class signed affidavits saying they did not want to be in the class). \nHere, the Superior Court found the Intervenors to be \nadequately protected by their participation in the action.  The Superior \nCourt cited Richmond and explained that it had allowed the eleven \nIntervenors to \"appear in this action\" and \"participate in all court \nproceedings.\"  14JA3617.  The Superior Court thus concluded that \"[t]he \npresence of the Intervenors protects their interests.\"  Id. \nThen, inexplicably, and contrary to the holding in Richmond, \nthe Superior Court held that it would deny the motion for class certification \nbecause of the Intervenors' objections, stating that its conclusion \"is based \non a balancing of interests and case management concerns.\"  Id.  The \nSuperior Court never articulated what interests or case management \nconcerns led to that conclusion, but Richmond provides that the Superior \n50 \n\nCourt erred regardless of whatever unspecified interests or case \nmanagement concerns the Superior Court may have had in mind. \nPlaintiffs' proposed class consists of approximately 7,775 \ninstitutionalized persons with developmental disabilities - 3,133 \nremaining in developmental centers and 4,642 remaining in non \ndevelopmental center institutions.  6JA1463-64 & 1466.  The Intervenors \nconsist of only eleven individuals, which constitutes less than 1110 of 1%   of \nthe approximately 7,775 class members.  Id.  Thus the amount of \nopposition here was far less than the opposition to the class in Richmond. \nMoreover, just as the opposition of an association (TDA) did \nnot justify denial of the motion for class certification in Richmond the \nviews of the two intervening organizations - CASH/PCR and California \nAssociation for the Retarded - are irrelevant.  Their membership allegedly \nconsists of family, friends, and conservators (lJA0088), all individuals that \ncannot unilaterally veto class members' preferences or IPP team \nrecommendations about community placement, no matter how well \ns., \nintentioned they may be.  See, e.g., Richard  supra, 2000 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS at p. *29 (enjoining DDS policy of giving parents, conservators and \nother legal representatives of DC residents unilateral veto authority over \n51 \n\nIPP team recommendations). \n10 \nThe intervening organizations broadly claim - along with \nother unnamed non-intervening affiliated organizations - to represent the \nfamily members, friends and conservators of less than 50% of the \ndevelopmental center population.  8JA1993 (\"Of the approximately 3,121 \nresidents in California Developmental Centers, nearly halfhave family \nmembers or conservators who are members of CASH/PCR or affiliated \norganizations.\") (citation omitted).  They do not claim to represent any \nclass members in non-DC institutions.  Even if families, friends and \nconservators could defeat the claims of the class members themselves, the \nIntervenors would still represent less than 20% of the class.  6JA1463-64 & \n1466.  This is a far cry from the \"vast majority\" required by Richmond. \nThe Superior Court adequately protected absent class \nmembers' interests by allowing intervention and participation in all court \nproceedings.  Thereafter, however, the Superior Court erred under \nRichmond in finding Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate representative \nadequacy based on a few intervening class members. \n2.  The Superior Court also erred in denying class \ncertification based on Intervenors' objections \nPlaintiffs do not seek to terminate or limit family involvement in the IPP \n10 \nprocess, except insofar as Defendants continue to implement a policy of \nallowing family members to unilaterally veto community placement \nrecommendations for DC residents in violation of Richard S. \n52 \n\nbecause the Intervenors' stated interests do not \nconflict with the relief Plaintiffs seek. \nThe Superior Court recognized that the interests of all class \nmembers, including Intervenors, are aligned:  all class members would like \nthorough assessments and the best services possible.  14JA3616.  Broadly \nstated, that is precisely the relief sought by Plaintiffs.  4JA1036-42.  The \nIntervenors' interests, as alleged, do not conflict with these objectives. \nThe Intervenors state their objectives as a \"desire to remain in \na developmental center setting in accordance with the IPP recommendation \nbecause their needs are best met in such an environment.\"  8JA1992; RT \n21 :24-23: 6.  Such concerns do not prevent class certification because they \nare not \"diametrically opposed\" to Plaintiffs' objectives.  Richmond, supra, \n29 Ca1.3d at p. 473.  Plaintiffs do not seek to move any institutionalized \nindividuals, including Intervenors or those they represent, into community \nsettings against their will or against the recommendations of their IPP \nteams.  4JA1039-40; RT 74:11-75:1.  Any decisions concerning the \nappropriate placement for individual class members, including Intervening \nclass members would, as now, occur through the individual assessment and \nplanning process.  RT 10:18-11:28.  Thus, the improvements Plaintiffs seek \nin the assessment and IPP process and in the enhancements they seek in the \ndevelopment of community resources are not inconsistent with Intervenors' \nprofessed interests. \n53 \n\nC.  THE SUPERIOR COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT \nTHERE IS A SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE TO CLASS \nCERTIFICATION. \nThe Superior Court found that Plaintiffs had not established \nthe superiority of class treatment, a finding infected by its erroneous \ndecisions about commonality (Section V.A, above) and adequacy (Section \nV.B., above) and compounded by its presumption that individual \"fair \nhearings\" would be an adequate substitute for this action.  14JA3617-18. \nThe Superior Court's holding is reversible error. \nThe Order rightly recognizes that \"Plaintiffs are seeking \nsystemwide injunctive relief only and are not seeking individualized relief.\" \n14JA3607.  The Superior Court thus stated that it \"would not address \nvariations in individual injunctive relief because Plaintiff would be seeking \ninjunctive relief on the system level and not as applied to specific \nindividuals.\"  14JA3608. \nYet when it came to address the issue of the superiority of the \nclass action over the alternative of thousands of individual cases the \nSuperior Court held that it \"presume[d]\" California's statutory fair hearing \nprocess (§ § 4700-4731) precludes resolution of Plaintiffs' claims on a \nclasswide basis.  14JA3618.  The presumption is false.  The only relief \nPlaintiffs seek is systemic mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief, and \nthat is relief that the fair hearing process cannot provide. \n54 \n\n1.  California's statutory fair hearing process cannot \nremedy the systemic problems addressed or afford \nthe class-wide relief sought in this action. \nThe Superior Court's presumption is wrong.  The Lanterman \nAct fair hearing process is not empowered or designed to confront the \nsystemic issues or provide the mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  See Cal. Const. Art. VI, § 10 (Superior Court has original \njurisdiction over injunctive relief); Bell, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at pp. 745-\n46 (recognizing that Labor Commissioner hearing did not allow for \ninjunctive relief). \nAs an initial matter, the fair hearing process can be used only \nto challenge the actions ofa \"service agency,\" (§ 4710.5(a)), defined as a \n\"developmental center or regional center\" (§ 4704).  DDS and the other \nState Defendants are not service agencies, except insofar as DDS operates \nthe DCs and provides services directly to individuals placed in DCs, which \nmeans it is not subject to the fair hearing process for any class members \ninstitutionalized in a non-DC institution or at risk of institutionalization. \nThus, because the State Defendants are not service agencies, Plaintiffs' \nchallenges to their policies and practices cannot be brought against them in \nfair hearings. \nNot only can Plaintiffs not bring their claims in fair hearings, \nthey cannot recover the relief prayed for in this action in fair hearings. \nRamos v. County a/Madera (1971) 4 Ca1.3d 685,690-92 involved a fair \n55 \n\nhearing scheme not unlike the fair hearing procedure at issue here. \nCompare § 4700 et seq. with § 10950 et seq.  In Ramos, a group of families \nsought declaratory and injunctive class relief and individual damages from \nthe termination of their government benefits.  Id. at 688.  The trial court \nheld that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies \navailable in a fair hearing procedure.  Id. at 690.  The Court of Appeal \nreversed, in part, characterizing the suggested administrative remedy as \n\"unavailable or inadequate\" due to the individualized nature of the fair \nhearing procedures: \nThe entire fair hearing scheme is premised on an \nindividualized treatment of claims for aid.  Each \nindividual theoretically has different needs, and his \nclaim for aid would be treated separately.  In no \nsection of this chapter ... is there provision for class \nrelief.  It is the individual who must apply for a \nhearing, regarding his application for or receipt of \naid.  He must do so in person or through an \nauthorized representative.  It is clear that the hearing \nscheme established by the Legislature does not \ncontemplate class actions.  There was therefore no \nfailure to exhaust an administrative remedy for class \nrelief, for no such administrative remedy existed. \nId. at 690-91 (emphasis in original); Rose v. City a/Hayward (1981) 126 \nCal.App.3d 926, 935-37 (\"A hearing officer would violate both statutory \nand constitutional authority in opening his hearing room to a class action.\") \nThe same reasoning applies here.  The Lanterman Act fair \nhearing process outlined in § 4700 et seq. is premised similarly on \nindividualized needs for individualized services.  §§ 4710(a) & 4710.5(a). \n56 \n\nThe fair hearing process is based on \"a person\" who has been denied \n\"services.\"  See §§ 4701.5 (defining \"applicant\" as \"a person\") 4702 \n(defining \"claimant\" as \"an applicant or recipient\") 4703.5 (defining \n\"recipient\" as \"a person\") & 4703.7 (defining \"services\" as those set forth \nin a \"recipient's individual program plan\").  A fair hearing request form is a \ndocument filled out and submitted by a \"claimant\" who is dissatisfied with \na service agency decision or action.  See §§ 4702.6 & 4710.5. \nAdditionally, the fair hearing process is simply not designed \nto challenge Defendants' systemic policies or practices that violate the \nLanterman Act and other state and federal laws, such as DDS's failure to \nmonitor RC compliance with law, DDS's failure to assess gaps in service \nneeds on a state-wide basis, or DDS's failure to monitor and set standards \nfor the CPP.  4JA0936-1 049.  There is no provision for class relief and the \nfair hearing procedures could not possibly allow for the time and discovery \ninherent in a class action because they are structured to expedite only \nindividual relief.  See §§ 4710.5(a) (setting 30 days statute oflimitations), \n4712(a) (requiring hearing within 50 days of hearing request, extendable \nonly 40 days for good cause), 4712(d) (requiring discovery exchange five \ndays before hearing) & 4710.7 (allowing access only to records in \nclaimant's file prior to filing a hearing request if an informal meeting is \nrequested).  Although there is a provision allowing consolidation of \nappeals, this is not akin to a class action or an avenue to seek systemic \n57 \n\nrelief - despite the consolidation each claimant retains his or her \nindividual rights to present evidence, confront and cross-examine \nwitnesses, appear with counsel, access records, and to have his or her own \ninterpreter.  §§ 4712.2 & 4701(f).  As in Ramos, the fair hearing process is \ninadequate because it cannot provide the classwide systemic remedy \nPlaintiffs seek. \nEven if the fair hearing process could provide a remedy, \ncourts have rejected the alternative of individual suits as a realistic remedy \nfor a class of persons with developmental disabilities: \"This is precisely the \ntype of group which class treatment was designed to protect.\" Armstead v. \nPingree (M.D. Fla. 1986) 629 F.Supp. 273,279 (pointing to \"plaintiffs' \nconfinement, their economic resources, and their mental handicaps\" as \nreasons to conclude that individual actions would be unlikely). \nThe Superior Court abused its discretion as it had no basis to \n\"presume\" that a fair hearing process eliminates the need for class \ncertification. \n2.  Class treatment is superior to thousands of \nindividual actions or a writ of mandate case. \nClass treatment is superior to multiple actions.  Multiple \nproceedings provide no benefit and add excessive costs.  Multiple actions to \nestablish the existence and illegality of Defendants' policies and practices \nwould burden the litigants and the courts with cumulative expenses, \n58 \n\ndiscovery efforts, and evidence.  See Sav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at p. 340; \nsee also Richmond, supra, 29 Ca1.3d at pp. 474-75  (recognizing that the \njudicial system substantially benefits by the efficient use of its resources); \nLebrilla v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1087 \n(explaining multiple actions require presentation of duplicative expert \ntestimony).  As in Reyes, \"this community of interest requirement is \nespecially satisfied here, because the trial court would have to redetermine \nthe legality of the [defendants' processes] in each case individually \npursued.\"  196 Cal.App4th at p. 1279. \nBut beyond the exponential costs inherent in a multitude of \nduplicative proceedings, considerations of equity favor certification.  The \nright to file a class action originated in equity, with the objective of \nredressing small wrongs that might otherwise go unredressed.  See Rose, \nsupra, 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 934.  The gaps and deficiencies in Defendants' \npolicies and practices are systemic causes of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization for thousands of people for years or decades.  This \naction seeks to ensure California's promise (codified in §§ 4501 & 4502) to \npersons with developmental disabilities of an entitlement to an opportunity \nto live integrated in the community by being served in the least restrictive \nsetting.  See Sav-On, supra, 34 Ca1.4th at pp. 340-41 (citing strong public \npolicy in favor of class certification in general and a public policy in favor \nof affording employee protections). \n59 \n\nThe nature of this class in particular requires a systemic \napproach where individualized violations are difficult to articulate and \nprove, and the individuals whose rights are violated are people with \ncognitive or other severe disabilities, most without the resources to \nundertake the complex and daunting task of suing the myriad state and \nprivate entities responsible for violating their rights.  Reyes, supra, 196 \nCal.App.3d at p. 1270, n.6 (regarding appropriateness of class action for \ngovernment benefits litigation) & pp. 1279-80 (certifying class of disabled \nand indigent plaintiffs for several reasons including their inability to obtain \nprivate counsel, judicial economy, finality of judgment binding all parties \nto a decree, and enforceability through contempt or supplemental decree); \nVasquez v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal.3d 800,810 (\"Modem society \nseems increasingly to expose men to ... group injuries for which \nindividually they are in a poor position to seek legal redress, either because \nthey do not know enough or because such redress is disproportionately \nexpensive.\"). \nNo individual plaintiff could or should be the test case for this \ntype of action with its four-year history, numerous dispositive motions, \ncountless discovery and ex-parte motions, writs and this appeal.  Rose, \nsupra, 126 Cal.App.3d at pp. 934-35 (\"We see no basis in law or equity for \nmaking a sacrificial lamb of [plaintiff] or any other individual class \nmember\"). \n60 \n\nEven if a test case presented itself and succeeded, absent \nplaintiffs could not enforce the judgment or decree.  See Miller v.  Woods \n(1983) 148 Ca1.App.3d 862, 872 (\"Class members are not parties to an \nindividual decree.  They cannot enforce such decision by contempt or \nsupplemental decree.\").  Presumably for this reason, among others, \nCalifornia courts certify class actions even where plaintiffs seek a writ of \nmandate, thus proving that a writ of mandate standing alone is not a \nsufficient substitute for a class action.  Reyes, supra, 196 Ca1.App.3d at pp. \n1279-80 (affirming certification of plaintiffs' class despite plaintiffs' \nrequest for peremptory writ of mandate in addition to complaint); Gonzales, \nsupra, 116 Ca1.App.3d at pp. 981, 986 (same). \nAs stated in Rose:  \"We cannot permit such an inequity [as \nthe denial of a motion for class certification] when the very purpose of class \nactions is to open a practical avenue of redress to litigants who would \notherwise find no effective recourse for the vindication of their legal \nrights.\"  126 Cal.App.3d at p. 935. \n3.  The Superior Court lacked support for its holding \nthat Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate superiority. \nThe Superior Court cited Linder, supra, 23 Ca1.4th at p. 446, \nfor the proposition that trial courts are obligated to consider the role of class \nactions in deterring and redressing wrongdoing.  14 JA3607 & 3617-18. \nThe reason Linder imposed that obligation was to ensure that a wrongdoer \n61 \n\nis not allowed to continue wrongdoing \"simply because their conduct \nharmed large numbers of people in small amounts instead of small numbers \nof people in large amounts.\" Linder, supra, 23 Ca1.4th at p. 446.  That \nrationale should have led the Superior Court to certify the class here \nbecause the claims in this case involve conduct that harms large numbers of \npeople in systemic ways that are beyond the means of any individual \nplaintiff to prosecute through years of factual and expert discovery, much \nless trial. \nThe Superior Court also implied that class certification might \nbe improper because of the possibility that the Defendants were subjected \nto external oversight, relying on Caro v. Proctor & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 \nCal.App.4th 644,660.  14JA3607 & 3617-18.  As an initial matter, any \nreliance on Caro would be misplaced because neither Caro nor any other \ncase suggests that executive branch oversight of an agency could preclude a \nclass action where the agency violates the law.  Moreover, in Caro, the \ncourt held that previous judicial decisions against the defendant minimized \nthe availability of monetary damages and mooted plaintiffs' requested \ninjunctive relief.  Id.  Here, the opposite is true.  One reason this action \nbecame necessary is that Defendants failed to voluntarily continue to follow \nthe law and began to backslide after the consent decree in the Coffelt case \nexpired.  12JA3093-94. \nFinally, Basurco v. 2Ft Century Ins. Co. (2003) 108 \n62 \n\nCal.AppAth 110, 120-22, cited by the Superior Court (14JA3607 & 3617), \nis likewise inapposite.  The Basurco court affirmed the denial of class \ncertification for a class of homeowners seeking monetary damages, in part, \nbecause of the trial court's innovative methods of dealing with hundreds of \nsimilar cases that had already been filed, including its issuance of a global \norder that established attorney committees and filing procedures.  Id. at \n121-22.  Here, Plaintiffs seek no individual or monetary relief and there is \nno alternative process or forum capable of granting the mandamus, \ninjunctive and declaratory relief sought to the entire class. \nIn short, no authority supports the Superior Court's holding \nthat Plaintiffs failed to establish the superiority of this class action over any \nalternative. \n63 \n\nVI.  CONCLUSION \nThe Superior Court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification is marked by erroneous legal assumptions that caused the use \nof improper criteria.  The Order should be reversed and the Superior Court \nshould be directed to enter a new order granting Plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification. \nDATED:  August 8, 2006  Protection and Advocacy, Inc. \nBingham McCutchen LLP \nDLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary LLP \n¥ \nJ1tctt \n-eo \nT \nBy: \nMichael  .

It concluded that the state had failed to adequately carry \nout its legal obligations to provide institutionalized Lanterman residents with \nservices and supports in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs, in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.   \n \n  IPP Violations \n \nDOJ found that Lanterman DC has failed to follow its own policies and has \ninadequate policies and practices with regard to the development and \nimplementation of Individual Program Plans (IPPs) and discharge planning. DOJ \ndetermined that the IPP process was generally inadequate with regard to addressing \nresidents’ need for placement in the most integrated setting, as; \n \n•  Critical regional center personnel often do not attend annual IPP \nreviews, thus thwarting any meaningful discussion of community \nalternatives; \n•  In-depth community service assessments are not conducted for all \nLanterman residents; \n•  Teams fail to make and memorialize a considered determination on \nproper placement and whether or not the person opposes such \nplacement; and \n                                           \n1 Pursuant to the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., the United \nStates Department of Justice has the authority to conduct investigations of the conditions of care for individuals with \ndisabilities who have been institutionalized.  DOJ also has the authority to issue plans of correction and seek legal \nremedies for violations of civil rights of individuals who are institutionalized.  42 U.S.C. § 1997a. \n  1\n\n•  IPP teams condition recommendations regarding community \nplacement on the current availability of community services, rather \nthan on the needs of the individuals being assessed. p. 43-49. \n \nDOJ’s findings are similar to plaintiffs’ allegations in CPF v. DDS regarding the \nfailures of the IPP process, such as:  \n   \n•  Regional centers’ failure to attend IPP meetings; \n•  In-depth community assessments are not conducted for all Lanterman DC \nresidents; \n•  Systemic failure to conduct timely and comprehensive assessments necessary to \nidentify the services for which class members are eligible and that could meet \ntheir needs in less restrictive, more integrated community settings; and \n•  IPP teams’ conditioning recommendations regarding community placement on \nthe current availability of community services, rather than on the needs of the \nindividuals being assessed. \n \nThe Number of People Dying at Lanterman Was Greater Than the \nNumber of People Moving to the Community \n \nDOJ further found a reduction in the number of individuals moving from \nLanterman to the community in recent years, noting that more people died at \nLanterman than moved to the community. p. 44. These findings are similar to \nplaintiffs’ allegations in CPF v. DDS that the decrease in community movement \nrecommendations since 1998 is based not on the needs and choices of the \nindividual residents but, rather, on the lack of a mandate from DDS, inadequate \nindividualized IPP planning by regional centers and DC staff, and/or lack of \nsufficient fiscal resources for the development of quality living arrangements and \nancillary supports. \n \n  Minimal Remedial Measures \n \nDOJ identified the following minimal remedial measures to provide services to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities in the most integrated settings \nappropriate to their needs:   \n•  Conduct interdisciplinary assessments with people who have adequate \ninformation about community-based options;  \n•  Develop and implement transition plans for individuals who want to move to \nthe community and for whom a more integrated setting would be appropriate; \n  2\n\n•  Develop and implement a protocol to address outstanding issues and concerns \nwith the State’s regional centers that may impede, limit, or delay placement of \nresidents into more integrated community settings, and  \n•  Reform the IPP process to better ensure that the teams make informed and \nproper decisions with regard to the most integrated setting for each resident. p. \n55-56. \n \nFailure to Provide Safe Living Conditions & Adequate Treatment \n \nDOJ found that Lanterman fails to provide its residents with a reasonably safe \nliving situation. Between 2003 and 2004, at least 275 allegations of abuse and \nneglect against residents were made. The most horrifying incident occurred in \n2002, when A.Z. “died of blunt force trauma after being stomped repeatedly in his \nbedroom at Lanterman.” There was evidence that both the roommate and a psych. \ntech. were responsible, but the psych. tech. was not charged and the roommate was \nfound to be too mentally impaired to be charged.  p. 4.   \n \nDOJ found that residents regularly face harm in their day-to-day lives.  Between \n2003 and 2004, there were 1,681 incidents, of which 233 were lacerations (61 \nrequiring sutures) and at least 67 were fractures. Some residents sustained genital \nlacerations, a topic that has been the report of a recent PAI public report.  DOJ felt \nthat it was unclear how so many serious injuries could occur at a facility \nresponsible for keeping residents safe, but expressed particular concern that the \ncauses of the injuries were, in so many situations, found to be “unknown,” \nsuggesting lack of safety and lack of appropriate supervision. DOJ found a number \nof problems regarding the incident reporting system, including failure to track \nincidents, failure to report incidents in a timely manner, and adequacy of incident \ninvestigations.  \n \nTraining and Behavioral Services, Restraints, and Psychiatric Care \n \nPeople with developmental disabilities who reside in institutions have a right to \nminimal adequate training.2 229 Lanterman residents with behavioral problems \nreceived training and associated psychological and behavioral services through a \nformal behavioral program. But Lanterman fails to provide adequate, appropriate \nservices.  DOJ found that “[t]his deficiency contributes to poor resident outcomes, \nincluding poor progress in treating problem behaviors, increasing risk for highly \n                                           \n2 Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, at 322 (1982).   \n  3\n\nrestrictive interventions, increased risk for injury and abuse, and decreased \nopportunity for placement in the most integrated setting.”  p 12. \n \nThe following is an example of a client who was poorly served by Lanterman: \n \n“H.A. is a 27-year-old man who was admitted to Lanterman at age 13 for treatment \nof his behavior problems. However, it does not appear that the facility has made \nmuch, if any, progress in addressing his behavior over the past 14 years. During his \nstay at Lanterman, he has developed serious self-injurious behavior, such as hitting \nhis head. Through self-injury, H.A. recently detached the retina in one of his eyes.  \nBetween January and October 2004, as a result of his uncontrolled behaviors, he \nhas also suffered seven other significant injuries. Prior to the hospitalization for his \ndetached retina, H.A. averaged between 139 and 357 episodes of self-injurious \nbehavior each month. Between January and October 2004, staff imposed 5644 \nhighly restrictive interventions on him. … His behavior program includes the use \nof a helmet and arm splints. He also receives three separate psychotropic \nmedications. Despite the magnitude of his injuries and the high rate of use of \nhighly restrictive interventions, Lanterman failed to update or change his \nbehavioral assessment or behavior treatment plan at any time during this period. \nGenerally accepted professional standards mandate that this should have occurred. \nMoreover, his team has not recommended H.A. for placement in a more integrated \nsetting because of his high rate of uncontrolled behaviors. Thus, the facility’s \nfailures may be prolonging his behavior and may be denying him access to \nplacement in a more integrated setting [emphasis added].”  p. 12.   \n \nHealth Care Services  \n \nDOJ found that Lanterman failed to provide residents with adequate medical care.  \nGeneral medical care and nursing care were found to be deficient, both in terms of \ndirect services and in terms of oversight. The lack of nutritional and physical \nmanagement and lack of adequate occupational and physical therapy services \n“place residents at great risk for injury or death.” p. 29.   \n \n  \n \n \n \nF:\\DOCS\\ELLEN\\Supported  Life\\2006\\DOJ Lanterman Report Summary.doc \n  4",

THIS MOTION \nCONCERNS THE USE AND EXCHANGE OF \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE \nCOURT SUPERVISED DISCOVERY PROCESS. \nTHE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSIONS \nINVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE \nREGIONAL CENTERS AND THE STATE \nDEFENDANTS ARE NOT DEPOSITIONS UNDER \nC.C.P. 2025.010 ET SEQ. IN ADDITION, THE \n32 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nDOCUMENTS THAT ARE BEING ALLEGEDLY \nVIEWED AND EXCHANGED WERE \nAPPARENTLY EXCHANGED VOLUNTARILY \nBETWEEN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE \nSTATE DEFENDANTS AND WERE NOT \nCOMPELLED UNDER C.C.P. 2031.010 ET SEQ. \nGIVEN THESE FACTS, THE COURT NOTES \nTHAT PLAINTIFFS’ REMEDY MIGHT BE A \nSEPARATE ACTION FOR DAMAGES OR \nINJUNCTION UNDER WELFARE AND \nINSTITUTIONS CODE 4518. ALTHOUGH THE \nUSE (OR ABUSE) OF INFORMATION IN THE \nCONDUCT OF LITIGATION IS NORMALLY \nHANDLED BY THE COURT THAT IS \nMANAGING THE CASE, CEDARS-SINAI MED. \nCTR. V. SUPERIOR COURT (1998) 18 CAL. 4TH \n1, IN THIS SITUATION THE INFORMATION \nWAS NOT OBTAINED UNDER COURT \nSUPERVISION, THE COURT HAS NOT \nIMPOSED ANY LIMITS ON THE EXCHANGE OR \nUSE OF INFORMATION THAT IS OBTAINED \nOUTSIDE THE DISCOVERY PROCESS, AND THE \nLEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED AN EXPRESS \nREMEDY FOR DISCLOSURES OF \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. THAT SAID, \nTHE PARTIES SEEK TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES \nIN THE CONTEXT OF A MOTION FOR A \nPROTECTIVE ORDER AND THE COURT WILL \nDO SO. MERITS. THIS MOTION CONCERNS \nCOMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE \nREGIONAL CENTERS AND THE STATE \nDEFENDANTS. THE “STATE DEFENDANTS” \nARE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL \nSERVICES (DDS), THE CALIFORNIA \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (DHS), \nAND THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH, \nALL OF WHICH ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY \n(HHSA). THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE \n(DOF) IS ALSO A “STATE DEFENDANT.” AT \nISSUE IS WHETHER WELFARE AND \nINSTITUTIONS CODE 4514 RESTRICTS THE \nSHARING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nAMONG THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE \nSTATE DEFENDANTS WHEN THEY ARE \nCO-DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION THAT \nCONCERNS THAT CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION. LACHES/WAIVER/SANCTIONS \nREGARDING PAST CONDUCT. THE COURT \nWILL NOT IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE \nSTATE DEFENDANTS OR THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS FOR THEIR PAST CONDUCT OR \nLIMIT THEIR USE OF INFORMATION \nOBTAINED BEFORE THE ORDER ON THIS \nMOTION. THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY THIS \nMOTION FIRST CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF \nPLAINTIFFS IN OR BEFORE OCTOBER 2003 \n33 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nAND PLAINTIFFS RAISED THOSE ISSUES WITH \nDEFENDANTS IN OCTOBER 2003. PLAINTIFFS \nARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES \nOF THEIR DELAY IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO \nTHE COURT. THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE OR \nAFFECT ANY SEPARATE ACTION UNDER \nWELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS 4518. \nGUIDELINES FOR FUTURE CONDUCT. THE \nCOURT FINDS THAT THE DISCLOSURE AND \nUSE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY \nTHE REGIONAL CENTERS IS LIMITED BY \nWELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE 4514. \nTHE LEGISLATURE IMPOSED LIMITS ON THE \nDISCLOSURE AND USE OF CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION AND THOSE LIMITS APPLY \nEVEN WHEN THE REGIONAL CENTERS FIND \nTHEMSELVES AS CO-DEFENDANTS WITH THE \nSTATE DEFENDANTS. THE COURT HAS \nCONSIDERED, AND REJECTS, THE ARGUMENT \nOF THE STATE DEFENDANTS THAT THE \nCOURT SHOULD CONSIDER THE \nPRACTICALITIES OF JOINT DEFENSE AND THE \nBURDEN THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED IF THE \nDEFENDANTS COULD NOT SHARE \nINFORMATION INFORMALLY AMONG \nTHEMSELVES. SECTION 4514 SETS \nLIMITATIONS ON DISCLOSURE AND \nEXCHANGE OF INFORMATION, AND IT IS NOT \nRELEVANT TO THIS MOTION WHETHER \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THAT STATUTE WOULD \nIMPOSE A BURDEN ON THE DEFENDANTS. \nTHE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN, HOWEVER, \nEXCHANGE RECORDS AND DISCUSS \nINFORMATION IF IT IS PERMITTED BY THE \nEXCEPTIONS TO SECTION 4514. SECTION \n4514(B). THE COURT FINDS THAT SECTION \n4514(B) IS APPLICABLE TO THE SITUATION \nPRESENTED. SECTION 4514(B) STATES THAT \nA REGIONAL CENTER MAY EXCHANGE \nRECORDS AND DISCUSS INFORMATION \n“WHEN THE PERSON WITH A \nDEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY, WHO HAS THE \nCAPACITY TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT, \nDESIGNATES INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM \nINFORMATION OR RECORDS MAY BE \nRELEASED, EXCEPT THAT NOTHING IN THIS \nCHAPTER SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO COMPEL \nA PHYSICIAN, PSYCHOLOGIST, SOCIAL \nWORKER, MARRIAGE AND FAMILY \nTHERAPIST, NURSE, ATTORNEY, OR OTHER \nPROFESSIONAL TO REVEAL INFORMATION \nTHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO HIM OR HER IN \nCONFIDENCE BY A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE \nPERSON UNLESS A VALID RELEASE HAS BEEN \nEXECUTED BY THAT FAMILY MEMBER.” THE \nWAIVER DOCTRINE THAT NORMALLY \nAPPLIES TO THE PRODUCTION OF DISCOVERY \n34 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nIS NOT APPLICABLE IN THIS SITUATION \nBECAUSE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE \nSTATE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT SEEKING TO \nOBTAIN OR EXCHANGE THE INFORMATION \nIN THE DISCOVERY PROCESS. HOWEVER, BY \nFILING THIS LAWSUIT, THE PLAINTIFFS \nEFFECTIVELY AGREED THAT INFORMATION \nOR RECORDS RELEVANT TO THE CLAIMS IN \nTHIS CASE COULD BE RELEASED TO THE \nREGIONAL CENTERS AND THE DDS FOR \nPURPOSES RELATED TO THIS LAWSUIT. THE \nRESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE OR \nEXCHANGE OF INFORMATION FROM FAMILY \nMEMBERS WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT. \nSECTION 4514(C). THE COURT FINDS THAT \nSECTION 4514(C) IS APPLICABLE TO THE \nSITUATION PRESENTED. SECTION 4514(C) \nSTATES THAT A REGIONAL CENTER MAY \nEXCHANGE RECORDS AND DISCUSS \nINFORMATION “TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY \nFOR A CLAIM, OR FOR A CLAIM OR \nAPPLICATION TO BE MADE ON BEHALF OF A \nPERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL \nDISABILITY FOR AID, INSURANCE, \nGOVERNMENT BENEFIT, OR MEDICAL \nASSISTANCE TO WHICH HE OR SHE MAY BE \nENTITLED.” THIS LAWSUIT QUALIFIES AS “A \nCLAIM (cid:0) FOR AID, (cid:0) , GOVERNMENT \nBENEFIT, OR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO \nWHICH [A PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL \nDISABILITY] MAY BE ENTITLED.” THE \nIMPLICIT ISSUE IS WHETHER THIS SECTION \nAPPLIES ONLY WHEN THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL \nASSISTANCE FOR PERSONS WITH \nDEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR ALSO \nAPPLIES WHEN REGIONAL CENTERS ARE \nSEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY \nHAVE ALREADY PROVIDED THE REQUIRED \nASSISTANCE TO PERSONS WITH \nDEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE COURT \nHOLDS THAT THE INTENT OF THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE INQUIRY \nFOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, THE STATUTE \nDOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE INTENT OF \nTHE REGIONAL CENTERS IS A FACTOR. \nSECOND, IF INTENT WERE A FACTOR, THE \nSTANDARD WOULD BE UNWORKABLE \nBECAUSE A REGIONAL CENTER COULD START \nEVALUATING A CLAIM INTENDING TO TAKE \nONE COURSE OF ACTION THEN CHANGE ITS \nAPPROACH AS INFORMATION BECAME \nAVAILABLE. THE COURT FINDS THAT SECTION \n4514(N) PERMITS THE INFORMAL EXCHANGE \nOF RECORDS AND DISCUSSION OF \nINFORMATION BETWEEN AND AMONG THE \nREGIONAL CENTERS AND THE STATE \n35 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nDEFENDANTS IN CONNECTION WITH \nEVALUATING THE CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFFS \nIN THIS CASE FOR AID AND GOVERNMENT \nBENEFITS. SECTION 4514(F). SECTION \n4514(F) IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE \nSITUATION PRESENTED. SECTION 4514 (F) \nSTATES THAT A REGIONAL CENTER MAY \nEXCHANGE RECORDS AND DISCUSS \nINFORMATION “TO THE COURTS, AS \nNECESSARY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF \nJUSTICE.” THIS SECTION WOULD PROBABLY \nPERMIT THE PRODUCTION OF INFORMATION \nAND RECORDS IN DISCOVERY (BECAUSE \nDISCOVERY IS UNDER COURT SUPERVISION) \nAND WOULD PERMIT THE COURT TO ORDER \nTHE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS AND \nINFORMATION. THE FACTUAL SITUATION IS, \nHOWEVER, THE INFORMAL EXCHANGE OF \nINFORMATION AMONG PARTIES OUTSIDE \nTHE FORMAL DISCOVERY PROCESS. IF THE \nINFORMATION WERE EXCHANGED IN THE \nFORMAL DISCOVERY PROCESS, THEN \nPLAINTIFFS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO \nRECEIVE ALL DOCUMENTS EXCHANGED AND \nTO PARTICIPATE IN ALL COMMUNICATIONS \nWITH WITNESSES. SECTION 4514(I). SECTION \n4514(I) IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE \nSITUATION PRESENTED. SECTION 4514 (F) \nSTATES THAT A REGIONAL CENTER MAY \nEXCHANGE RECORDS AND DISCUSS \nINFORMATION “TO THE COURTS AND \nDESIGNATED PARTIES AS PART OF A \nREGIONAL CENTER REPORT OR ASSESSMENT \nIN COMPLIANCE WITH A STATUTORY OR \nREGULATORY REQUIREMENT, INCLUDING, \nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, [VARIOUS \nCOMPLIANCE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS].” \nTHIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE \nFACTUAL SITUATION HERE BECAUSE THE \nINFORMAL EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION \nARE NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING A \n“REGIONAL CENTER REPORT OR \nASSESSMENT.” SECTION 4514(N). SECTION \n4514(N) IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE \nSITUATION PRESENTED. THE FIRST SENTENCE \nOF SECTION 4514(N) STATES THAT REGIONAL \nCENTERS CAN DISCLOSE INFORMATION AND \nRECORDS “TO AUTHORIZED LICENSING \nPERSONNEL WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY, OR \nWHO ARE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES \nOF, THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \nSERVICES, AND WHO ARE LICENSED OR \nREGISTERED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, (cid:0) AS \nNECESSARY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR \nDUTIES TO INSPECT, LICENSE, AND \nINVESTIGATE HEALTH FACILITIES AND \nCOMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES, AND TO \n36 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nENSURE THAT THE STANDARDS OF CARE \nAND SERVICES PROVIDED IN THESE \nFACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE AND \nAPPROPRIATE AND TO ASCERTAIN \nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES AND \nREGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FACILITY IS \nSUBJECT.” THE PURPOSE OF THIS LAWSUIT IS \nTO ENSURE THAT “THE STANDARDS OF CARE \nAND SERVICES PROVIDED IN [THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS] ARE ADEQUATE AND \nAPPROPRIATE AND [COMPLY] WITH THE \nRULES AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE \n[REGIONAL CENTERS ARE] SUBJECT.” THE \nCOMMUNICATIONS AT ISSUE, HOWEVER, DO \nNOT APPEAR TO BE BETWEEN THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE BOTH “[1] \nAUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES OF, THE \nSTATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES” \nAND [2] LICENSED OR REGISTERED HEALTH \nPROFESSIONALS.” THE INFORMAL \nCOMMUNICATIONS WERE WITH \nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE DDS, THE DMH, \nAND THE DOF AS WELL AS WITH \nREPRESENTATIVES OF THE DHS. IN \nADDITION, DEFENDANTS MAKE NO \nARGUMENT THAT THE PERSONS IN THE \nINFORMAL MEETINGS WERE “LICENSED OR \nREGISTERED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.” \nTHEREFORE, THIS SUBSECTION IS NOT \nAPPLICABLE. EFFECT OF PROTECTIVE ORDER. \nTHE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE DDS DO \nNOT APPEAR TO BE SHARING INFORMATION \nDESIGNATED AS “CONFIDENTIAL CONSUMER \nINFORMATION” UNDER PARAGRAPH 1 OF \nTHE PROTECTIVE ORDER WITH PERSONS \nWHO ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SEE THAT \nINFORMATION UNDER PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE \nPROTECTIVE ORDER. THEREFORE, THERE \nDOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A VIOLATION OF \nTHE PROTECTIVE ORDER. OTHER ISSUES. THE \nARGUMENT OF DEFENDANTS CONCERNING \nTHE LITIGATION PRIVILEGE (CIVIL CODE \n47(B)) DOES NOT APPEAR RELEVANT TO THIS \nMOTION. THE LITIGATION PRIVILEGE \nPROTECTS PERSONS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY \nFOR THEIR ACTIONS IN EARLIER LITIGATION. \nTHIS MOTION CONCERNS THE COURT’S \nCONTROL OVER HOW THE PARTIES \nEXCHANGE INFORMATION IN THE COURSE \nOF LITIGATION, NOT CIVIL LIABILITY FOR THE \nIMPROPER USE OF INFORMATION. THE \nCOURT DOES NOT ADDRESS WHETHER CIVIL \nCODE 47(B) WOULD BE A DEFENSE TO A \nCLAIM UNDER WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS \nCODE 4518 UNDER THE FACTS PRESENTED. \nDocket Entry: TR - MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE \nORDER - DENIED \n37 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v.

DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nIS THE IDENTITY OF STATE EMPLOYEES WHO \nPARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE \nBCP AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE BCP \nPROCESS. THE COURT HAS CONSIDERED THE \nFACTORS IDENTIFIED IN EVIDENCE CODE \n1040(B)(2) AND WEIGHED (1) THE STATE’S \nNECESSITY FOR PRESERVING THE \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION \nWITH (2) THE NECESSITY FOR DISCLOSURE IN \nTHE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. THE COURT HAS \nALSO CONSIDERED THE RECENT \nAMENDMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA \nCONSTITUTION, ARTICLE I, SECTION 3, IN \nPROPOSITION 59, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT \nTHE COURT TO NARROWLY CONSTRUE \nEVIDENCE CODE 1040(B)(2) BECAUSE IT \nLIMITS THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO \nINFORMATION CONCERNING “THE CONDUCT \nOF THE PEOPLE’S BUSINESS.” THE COURT \nDOES NOT ADDRESS WHETHER PLAINTIFFS \nMAY TAKE THE DEPOSITIONS OF THE \nIDENTIFIED STATE EMPLOYEES OR THE \nSCOPE OF ANY SUCH DEPOSITIONS. \nINTERROGATORIES THAT SEEK \nINFORMATION BASED ON UNDEFINED AND \nARGUABLY UNCLEAR TERMS. SI# 91-92, \n106-109. GRANTED AS TO 91 AND 92.

IS GRANTED AND THE PRIOR ORDER IS MODIFIED. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IS PROCEDURALLY PROPER. PROCEDURALLY, THE \nCOURT RETAINS DISCRETION TO MODIFY ITS ORDERS. KERNS V. CSE INS. \nGROUP (2003) 106 CAL. APP. 4TH 368, 388 (”TRIAL COURTS HAVE THE \nINHERENT POWER TO RECONSIDER AND CORRECT THEIR OWN INTERIM \nDECISIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE”). THE COURT \nHAS REVIEWED ITS ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 6, 2003, AND FINDS IT TO \nBE LESS THAN CLEAR. THEREFORE, CLARIFICATION IS PROPER. \nMODIFICATION OF THE PRIOR ORDER AT THIS TIME IS APPROPRIATE \nBECAUSE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STATED THEY INTEND TO SEEK WRIT RELIEF. A \nMOTION BY A PARTY TO RECONSIDER STAYS THE TIME IN WHICH TO FILE \nAN APPEAL, C.R.C. 3(D), AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE COMMENT TO \nC.R.C. 3(D) STATES THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE RULE IS “TO ENCOURAGE \nRECOURSE TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR RELIEF FROM AN APPEALLABLE \nORDER; IF GRANTED, SUCH RELIEF WOULD OBVIATE THE NEED FOR AN \nAPPEAL.” APPLYING THE SAME LOGIC TO THIS SITUATION, IT IS \nAPPROPRIATE FOR THE COURT TO CLARIFY ITS PRIOR ORDER SO THAT A \nWRIT CAN BE AVOIDED, OR, IF TAKEN, CAN FOCUS ON A CLEARLY \nPRESENTED ISSUE. THE COURT OBSERVES THAT THE MOTION TO CLARIFY \nDOES NOT EXTEND THE TIME IN WHICH TO FILE A WRIT. BENSIMON V. \nSUPERIOR COURT (TARRANT APPAREL GROUP) (12/4/03), 03 C.D.O.S. \n10417. THE COURT’S PRIOR ORDER HELD ONLY THAT PLAINTIFFS COULD \nNOT OBTAIN A WRIT OF MANDATE TO COMPEL THE DDS TO CONFORM ITS \nPOLICIES AND PRACTICES TO THE LANTERMAN ACT. THE COURT MODIFIES \nTHE PRIOR ORDER REGARDING THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION. THE \nMODIFICATION IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nADJUDICATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT ORDER COMMINGLED ISSUES \nRELATING TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE FORM \n41 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nOF RELIEF. MCDOWELL V. WATSON (1997) 59 CAL. APP. 4TH 1155, 1159, \nHOLDS THAT THE GRAVAMEN, OR ESSENTIAL NATURE, OF A CAUSE OF \nACTION IS DETERMINED BY THE PRIMARY RIGHT ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN \nVIOLATED. THE PRIMARY RIGHT AT ISSUE IN THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nIS THAT DEFENDANTS ALLEGEDLY HAVE FAILED TO FUND AND PROVIDE \nCERTAIN SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE LANTERMAN ACT. \nMCDOWELL ALSO HOLDS THAT “THE NATURE OF THE RELIEF SOUGHT \nDOES NOT DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION BECAUSE \nTHE VIOLATION OF ONE PRIMARY RIGHT MAY ENTITLE THE INJURED \nPARTY TO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF RELIEF. (cid:0) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS A \nREMEDY AND NOT, IN ITSELF, A CAUSE OF ACTION . . . .” 59 CAL.APP.4TH \nAT 1159. THE PRAYER FOR RELIEF IN THE COMPLAINT STATES THAT \nPLAINTIFFS SEEK TO ENJOIN FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF THE LANTERMAN \nACT (PRAYER, PARA 8), A WRIT OF MANDATE TO COMPEL DEFENDANTS \nTO COMPLY WITH THEIR MINISTERIAL DUTIES UNDER THE LANTERMAN \nACT (PRAYER, PARA 12), AND AN INJUNCTION COMPELLING DEFENDANTS \nTO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES (PRAYER, PARA 13). THE PRIOR ORDER IS \nMODIFIED TO STATE THAT SUMMARY ADJUDICATION IS GRANTED ON THE \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION ONLY INSOFAR AS IT SEEKS WRIT RELIEF. \nPLAINTIFFS’ FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION IS NOT DISMISSED AT THIS TIME, \nAND PLAINTIFFS MAY CONTINUE TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY \nRELIEF AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS FOR THEIR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF \nTHE LANTERMAN ACT. THE COURT REAFFIRMS THAT PLAINTIFFS HAVE \nNOT STATED A MERITORIOUS REQUEST FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE TO \nCOMPEL THE DDS TO CONFORM ITS POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO THE \nLANTERMAN ACT. THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION CONCERNS THE OVERALL \nFUNDING AND OPERATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL \nSERVICES AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THIS CLAIM DOES NOT CONCERN \nDISCRETE POLICIES OR MINISTERIAL DUTIES AND CANNOT BE PURSUED \nTHROUGH A WRIT OF MANDATE. BY WAY OF DICTA, THE COURT \nOBSERVES THAT WHERE THE DDS HAS ADOPTED DISCRETE POLICIES, THEN \nIT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR AGGRIEVED PERSONS TO SEEK A WRIT OF \nMANDATE TO COMPEL THE DDS TO SET ASIDE THOSE POLICIES. CLEMENTE \nV. AMUNDSON (1998) 60 CAL. APP. 4TH 1094, 1096-1097. SIMILARLY, \nWHERE DISCRETE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DENIED DISCRETE SERVICES, \nTHEN IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK A WRIT \nOF MANDATE TO COMPEL A SERVICE PROVIDER TO COMPLY WITH A \nPROVISION OF THE LANTERMAN ACT. MASON V. OFFICE OF ADMIN. \nHEARINGS (2001) 89 CAL. APP. 4TH 1119 (PROCEEDING BY WRIT OF \nMANDATE). THIS IS NOT, HOWEVER, SUCH A CASE. ORDINARILY A TRIAL \nCOURT CAN ONLY SUMMARILY ADJUDICATE AN ENTIRE CAUSE OF ACTION. \nC.C.P. 437C(F)(1). GIVEN THE BREADTH OF THE COMPLAINT AND THE \nCOMPLEX NATURE OF THIS CASE, THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY TO ISOLATE \nAND ADJUDICATE A FORM OF RELIEF SOUGHT ON A CAUSE OF ACTION. \nC.R.C. 1800; VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. V. SUPERIOR COURT (2001) \n94 CAL.APP.4TH 695, 704-705 (COURTS MANAGING COMPLEX CASES \n“HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE WHATEVER EXCEPTIONAL MANAGEMENT \nACTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO [AVOID PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS \nON THE COURT OR THE LITIGANTS AND TO EXPEDITE THE CASE, KEEP \nCOSTS REASONABLE, AND PROMOTE EFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING BY THE \nCOURT, THE PARTIES, AND COUNSEL].”); LILIENTHAL & FOWLER V. \nSUPERIOR COURT (1993) 12 CAL.APP.4TH 1848 (WHERE CAUSES OF \nACTION ARE COMMINGLED IN A COMPLAINT, THE TRIAL COURTS MAY \n42 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nPARSE THE CLAIMS AS PLEAD INTO SEPARATE CAUSES OF ACTION). THE \nPRIOR ORDER DOES NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF PLAINTIFFS’ CAUSE OF \nACTION UNDER THE LANTERMAN ACT. DEFENDANTS AND PLAINTIFFS DID \nNOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE LANTERMAN ACT CLAIM IN THEIR \nPAPERS. THE PRIOR ORDER DOES NOT ADDRESS WHETHER THE COURT \nCAN ISSUE AN INJUNCTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE \nLANTERMAN ACT. DEFENDANTS RAISED THIS ISSUE IN FOOTNOTES, SO IT \nWAS NOT SQUARELY PRESENTED TO THE COURT. (D OPENING AT P8 FN 2; \nD OPPO AT 27-28; D REPLY AT P7, FN 1.) UNILOGIC, INC. V. BURROUGHS \nCORP. (1992) 10 CAL. APP. 4TH 612, 624 FN 2. THE STATE SUGGESTED \nTHAT IT COULD FILE A NEW MOTION TO ADDRESSES WHETHER PLAINTIFFS \nMAY OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION, \nAND THE COURT WILL ENTERTAIN SUCH A MOTION. IF THE NEW MOTION \nIS A MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION, THE PARTIES ARE \nENCOURAGED TO MEET AND CONFER REGARDING WHETHER IT IS \nAPPROPRIATE TO SHORTEN THE STATUTORY BRIEFING SCHEDULE. THE \nCOURT NOTES THAT THE ISSUE OF WHETHER PLAINTIFFS MAY OBTAIN \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION PRESENTS THE \nFOLLOWING SUB-ISSUES (AMONG OTHERS): (1) IS A WRIT PROCEEDING \nUNDER C.C.P. 1085 IS THE EXCLUSIVE MEANS TO COMPEL ACTION BY THE \nSTATE; (2) IS A WRIT PROCEEDING UNDER C.C.P. 1085 IS THE EXCLUSIVE \nMEANS TO PROHIBIT ACTION BY THE STATE; (3) IS THERE A MEANINGFUL \nDISTINCTION BETWEEN ORDERS MANDATING OR COMPELLING THE STATE \nTO TAKE SPECIFIED ACTIONS AND ORDERS PROHIBITING THE STATE FROM \nTAKING SPECIFIED ACTIONS; (4) DO PLAINTIFFS SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN \nTHIS CASE THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE RELIEF THEY SEEK \nBY WRIT OF MANDATE; AND (5) IF THE COURT CANNOT ORDER \nSYSTEMWIDE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LANTERMAN ACT AS SOUGHT IN \nTHE COMPLAINT, ARE PLAINTIFFS WITHOUT A REMEDY? THE ORDERS ON \nTHE MOTIONS FOR JOINDER WERE NOT PROPER. SEVERAL REGIONAL \nCENTERS FILED MOTIONS TO JOIN IN THE MOTION OF THE DDS FOR \nSUMMARY ADJUDICATION AND THE COURT GRANTED THOSE MOTIONS \nFOR JOINDER. PLAINTIFFS NOW ARGUE THAT THE ORDERS GRANTING THE \nMOTIONS FOR JOINDER WERE IMPROPER BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT \nSUPPORTED BY MEMORANDA OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES AND \nSEPARATE STATEMENTS OF UNDISPUTED FACTS. CCP 437C(B); VILLAGE \nNURSERIES V. GREENBAUM, 101 CAL. APP. 4TH 26, 46-47; FRAZEE V. SEELY \n(2002) 95 CAL. APP. 4TH 627, 636. PLAINTIFFS ARE CORRECT. THE STATE’S \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION CONCERNED THE LANTERMAN \nACT CLAIM AGAINST THE STATE. THE COURT INCORRECTLY CONCLUDED \nTHAT THE LANTERMAN ACT CLAIM AGAINST THE STATE WAS IDENTICAL \nTO THE LANTERMAN ACT CLAIM AGAINST THE REGIONAL CENTERS. A \nFURTHER REVIEW OF THE STATUTE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE STATE AND \nTHE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES TO PLAY UNDER THE \nLANTERMAN ACT. THEREFORE, THE COURT’S PRIOR ORDER REGARDING \nTHE STATE DOES NOT COMPEL THE CONCLUSION THAT PLAINTIFFS \nCANNOT OBTAIN WRITS OF MANDATE TO REQUIRE THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS TO COMPLY WITH THE LANTERMAN ACT. THE PRIOR ORDERS \nGRANTING THE MOTIONS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO JOIN IN THE \nMOTION OF THE DDS FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION ARE VACATED. THE \nMOTIONS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO JOIN IN THE MOTION OF THE \nDDS FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION ARE DENIED. IF THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS INTEND TO SEEK SUMMARY ADJUDICATION ON THE FIRST CAUSE \n43 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nOF ACTION, THEY MUST FILE THEIR OWN MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY \nADJUDICATION. PRIOR TO FILING ANY SUCH MOTIONS, THE REGIONAL \nCENTERS ARE DIRECTED TO MEET AND CONFER WITH PLAINTIFFS TO \nSTRUCTURE THE BRIEFING SO THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS FILE A \nCOMMON BRIEF THAT ADDRESSES ALL COMMON ISSUES AND (IF \nNECESSARY) LIMITED SEPARATE BRIEFS THAT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF \nSPECIFIC REGIONAL CENTERS. THE COURT WILL NOT CERTIFY THIS MATTER \nUNDER C.C.P. 166.1. PLAINTIFFS SUGGEST THAT THE PRIOR ORDER \nSHOULD BE CERTIFIED FOR APPELLATE REVIEW UNDER C.C.P. 166.1. IN \nTHE COURT’S OPINION, CERTIFICATIONS UNDER C.C.P. 166.1 SHOULD BE \nRESERVED FOR EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS AND UNRESOLVED ISSUES OF \nLAW. FROM THE COURT’S PERSPECTIVE, THE DECISION THAT PLAINTIFFS \nCANNOT OBTAIN A WRIT OF MANDATE DIRECTING THE DDS TO CONFORM \nITS POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO THE LANTERMAN ACT WAS BASED ON \nTHE APPLICATION OF SETTLED LAW TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE \nCOMPLAINT. THE COURT OF APPEAL MAY, OF COURSE, THINK OTHERWISE \nAND ENTERTAIN ANY WRIT PETITION. FURTHER PROCEEDINGS PLAINTIFFS \nARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE THEIR MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION BY \nJANUARY 9, 2004, AS REQUIRED BY THE CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER \nDATED NOVEMBER 23, 2003. ON A MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, \nTHE COURT MUST CONSIDER THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AND DETERMINE FOR \nEACH CLAIM WHETHER PLAINTIFFS CAN REPRESENT SIMILARLY SITUATED \nPERSONS. COMMON ISSUES MAY PREDOMINATE FOR SOME CLAIMS AND \nNOT FOR OTHERS AND PLAINTIFFS MAY BE TYPICAL REPRESENTATIVES \nFOR SOME CLAIMS BUT NOT FOR OTHERS. FLETCHER V. SECURITY PACIFIC \nNAT’L BANK (1979) 23 CAL. 3D 442 (ANALYZING CLASS CERTIFICATION \nSEPARATELY FOR CONTRACT CLAIMS AND UCL CLAIMS). THEREFORE, \nPLAINTIFFS MAY DEFER THE FILING OF THEIR MOTION FOR CLASS \nCERTIFICATION UNTIL AFTER IT IS DETERMINED WHAT CLAIMS WILL \nPROCEED. THE CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE REMAINS SET FOR \nMARCH 12, 2004, AT 10:00 AM. Docket Entry: TR - MOTION RE: \nCLARIFICATION - GRANTED IN PART \n \n11/06/2003    Document Description: THIS TENTATIVE RULING IS ISSUED BY JUDGE       \n  RONALD M. SABRAW MOTION OF DDS FOR JUDGMENT ON THE \nPLEADINGS ON THE SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION IS GRANTED. DDS \nASSERTS THAT PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO STANDING UNDER 42 USC 1983 TO \nPURSUE THE SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION. THE SEVENTH CAUSE OF \nACTION ARISES UNDER 42 USC 1983 AND ALLEGES A VIOLATION OF THE \nFEDERAL MEDICAID LAWS. IN GONZAGA UNIV. V. DOE (2002) 536 U.S. 273, \nTHE SUPREME COURT RECENTLY RESTATED THE STANDARD FOR WHETHER \nA CLAIM CAN BE ENFORCED THROUGH 42 USC 1983. THE ULTIMATE \nDETERMINATION IS WHETHER CONGRESS INTENDED TO CREATE A RIGHT. \nIN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION, THE COURT USES A THREE-PART TEST \nFOR GUIDANCE IN DETERMINING WHETHER A STATUTORY PROVISION \nCONFERS AN ENFORCEABLE FEDERAL RIGHT. FIRST, CONGRESS MUST \nHAVE INTENDED THAT THE PROVISION BENEFIT THE PLAINTIFF. SECOND, \nTHE RIGHT MUST NOT BE “VAGUE AND AMORPHOUS.” THIRD, THE \nSTATUTE MUST UNAMBIGUOUSLY IMPOSE A BINDING OBLIGATION ON \nTHE STATES. GONZANGA EXPANDED ON PREVIOUS LAW BY STRESSING \nTHE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A RIGHT AND A BENEFIT. THE COURT STATED, \n“SECTION 1983 PROVIDES A REMEDY ONLY FOR THE DEPRIVATION OF \n“RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES, OR IMMUNITIES SECURED BY THE CONSTITUTION \n44 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nAND LAWS” OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS RIGHTS, NOT THE \nBROADER OR VAGUER “BENEFITS” OR “INTERESTS,” THAT MAY BE \nENFORCED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THAT SECTION.” ID AT 283. \nGONZAGA REVIEWED SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER \nCONGRESS INTENDED TO CREATE A RIGHT; (1) THE “TEXT AND STRUCTURE \nOF A STATUTE;” (2) THE EXISTENCE OF “RIGHTS-CREATING” LANGUAGE; \n(3) WHETHER THE STATUTE ADDRESSES “INSTITUTIONAL POLICY AND \nPRACTICE” OR “WHETHER THE NEEDS OF ANY PARTICULAR PERSON HAVE \nBEEN SATISFIED.” THE COURT CONCLUDED, “[I]F CONGRESS WISHES TO \nCREATE NEW RIGHTS ENFORCEABLE UNDER § 1983, IT MUST DO SO IN \nCLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS TERMS -- NO LESS AND NO MORE THAN \nWHAT IS REQUIRED FOR CONGRESS TO CREATE NEW RIGHTS \nENFORCEABLE UNDER AN IMPLIED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.” ID AT \n290-291. DDS ARGUES THAT MEDI-CAL BENEFITS ARE BENEFITS, NOT \nRIGHTS. IN SABREE V. HOUSTON (E.D. PA. 2003) 245 F.SUPP.2D 653, THE \nCOURT APPLIED GONZAGA AND HELD THAT THE MEDICAID STATUTES \nREQUIRING THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WITH “REASONABLE \nPROMPTNESS” DID NOT CONFER INDIVIDUAL FEDERAL RIGHTS THAT \nCOULD BE ENFORCED UNDER 1983. SEE ALSO MAC V. BETIT (D.UTAH, \nAUGUST 26, 2003) 2003 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 16059, 2003 WL 22119134 \n(REACHING SAME CONCLUSION REGARDING OTHER MEDICAID \nPROVISIONS,). PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT BEFORE AND AFTER GONZANGA \nTHE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE HELD THAT MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES COULD \nSTATE CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 1983. IN BRYSON V. SHUMWAY (1ST CIR \n2002) 308 F.3D 79, THE COURT HELD THAT THERE IS A SECTION 1983 \nCAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM THE “REASONABLE PROMPTNESS” \nPROVISION OF 42 USC 1396A(A)(8). IN RABIN V. WILSON-COKER (D.CONN \n2003) 266 F. SUPP. 2D 332, 341-342, THE COURT REACHED A SIMILAR \nCONCLUSION, AND NOTED THAT IN 1996 “CONGRESS CONSIDERED A \nPROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE STRIPPED MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES OF A \nRIGHT TO SUE IN FEDERAL COURT UNDER SECTION 1983 BUT THE LAW AS \nENACTED CONTAINS NO SUCH STRIPPING PROVISION. THIS INDICATES \nTHAT CONGRESS CHOSE NOT TO DISTURB THE RIGHT TO SUE THAT \nBENEFICIARIES WERE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE UNDER PRIOR LAW.” OTHER \nTHAN THE ABOVE, THERE ARE PRESENTLY FEW FEDERAL GUIDEPOSTS \nREGARDING HOW GONZAGA APPLIES TO MEDICAID CLAIMS. THERE ARE \nNO CALIFORNIA GUIDEPOSTS. THEREFORE, THE COURT IS GUIDED \nPRIMARILY BY THE LANGUAGE OF GONZAGA ITSELF. THE COURT FINDS \nTHAT MAC V. BETIT, SUPRA, HAS A PERSUASIVE APPLICATION OF \nGONZAGA TO THE MEDICAID PROVISIONS. THE COURT HOLDS THAT \nMEDI-CAL BENEFITS ARE BENEFITS, NOT RIGHTS, AND THAT PLAINTIFFS \nCANNOT PURSUE THEIR CLAIMS UNDER 42 USC 1983. FIRST, THE \nGONZAGA COURT STATED THAT FOR A STATUTE TO CONFER A PRIVATE \nRIGHT OF ACTION, THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE MUST BE “ ‘PHRASED IN \nTERMS OF THE PERSONS BENEFITED.’ “ ID. AT 284. THE AUTHORIZING \nPROVISION OF THE MEDICAID ACT DOES NOT CONTAIN RIGHTS- CREATING \nLANGUAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROVISION PROVIDES: “FOR THE PURPOSE \nOF ENABLING EACH STATE, AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE UNDER THE \nCONDITIONS OF EACH STATE, TO FURNISH (1) MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ON \nBEHALF OF FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND OF AGED, BLIND \nOR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS, WHOSE INCOME AND RESOURCES ARE \nINSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COSTS OF NECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES, \nAND (2) REHABILITATION AND OTHER SERVICES TO HELP SUCH FAMILIES \n45 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nAND INDIVIDUALS ATTAIN OR RETAIN CAPABILITY FOR INDEPENDENCE OR \nSELF- CARE, THERE IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO BE APPROPRIATED FOR \nEACH FISCAL YEAR A SUM SUFFICIENT TO CARRY OUT THE PURPOSES OF \nTHIS SUBCHAPTER. THE SUMS MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THIS SECTION \nSHALL BE USED FOR MAKING PAYMENTS TO STATES WHICH HAVE \nSUBMITTED, AND HAD APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY, STATE PLANS FOR \nMEDICAL ASSISTANCE.” 42 USC 1396. THIS STATUTE MERELY ENABLES \nSTATES TO ADMINISTER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR THE INTENDED \nBENEFICIARIES AND AUTHORIZES PAYMENT TO STATES PARTICIPATING IN \nTHE MEDICAID PROGRAM; IT DOES NOT CREATE AN UNMISTAKABLE \nENFORCEABLE RIGHT IN THOSE BENEFICIARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE \nCOURT HAS REVIEWED THE FOLLOWING MEDICAID ACT PROVISIONS \nEXPRESSLY CITED IN PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT: 42 USC 1396A(A)(8) - \nMEDICAL ASSISTANCE MUST BE FURNISHED WITH REASONABLE \nPROMPTNESS. 42 USC 1396A(A)(10)(B) - MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE \nEQUALLY AVAILABLE TO ALL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. 42 USC \n1396A(A)(30)(A) - METHODS AND PROCEDURES SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT \nTO ENLIST PROVIDERS SO THAT CARE IS AVAIALBEL TO THE EXTENT SUCH \nCARE AND SERVICE SIS AVAILABLE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. 42 USC \n1396N(C )(2)( C) - IF STATES OFFER HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED \nSERVICES TO THE MENTALLY RETARDED UNDER A WAIVER OF THE \nSTATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, THE STATES MUST INFORM INDIVIDUALS OF \nTHE FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITAL, NURSING HOME, AND OTHER \nCARE. 42 USC 1396N(D)(2)( C) - IF STATES OFFER HOME AND COMMUNITY \nBASES SERVICES UNDER A WAIVER OF THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, \nTHE STATES MUST INFORM INDIVIDUALS OF THE FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES \nTO HOSPITAL, NURSING HOME, AND OTHER CARE. NONE OF THESE \nSTATUTES CONTAINS THE RIGHTS-CREATING LANGUAGE SPECIFIED IN \nGONZAGA. THE STATUTES ADDRESS “INSTITUTIONAL POLICY AND \nPRACTICE” NOT “WHETHER THE NEEDS OF ANY PARTICULAR PERSON \nHAVE BEEN SATISFIED.” SECOND, THE MEDICAID ACT SPECIFICALLY \nPROVIDES THAT IF THE SECRETARY FINDS THAT A STATE AGENCY FAILS TO \n“COMPLY SUBSTANTIALLY” WITH THE PROVISIONS IN THE ACT IN \nADMINISTERING THE STATE PLAN, THE SECRETARY IS TO NOTIFY THE \nSTATE AGENCY THAT IT WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE MEDICAID FUNDS \nUNTIL THE SECRETARY IS CONVINCED THAT THE STATE AGENCY IS \nCOMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS IN THE ACT. 42 USC 1396C. THUS, THE \nSTATUTE MERELY DESCRIBES WHAT STATES MUST DO TO ENSURE \nCONTINUED FUNDING AND AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY TO WITHHOLD \nOR LIMIT MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO A STATE IN VIOLATION OF ANY \nPROVISIONS WITHIN THAT SUBSECTION. IT DOES NOT, HOWEVER, GIVE \nRISE TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARIES OF \nTHE MEDICAID ACT. THE SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION IS DISMISSED. \nDocket Entry: TR - MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS GRANTED \nIN PART W/O LEAVE TO AMEND \n \n11/06/2003    Document Description: THIS TENTATIVE RULING IS ISSUED BY JUDGE       \n  RONALD M. SABRAW MOTION OF DDS FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF \nLANTERMAN ACT CAUSE OF ACTION (FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION) IS \nGRANTED. THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION SEEKS A WRIT UNDER CCP 1085. \nHUTCHINSON V. CITY OF SACRAMENTO (1993) 17 CAL. APP. 4TH 791, 796, \nSETS OUT THE GENERAL LAW ON WHEN THE COURT MAY AND MAY NOT \nISSUE A WRIT. “A WRIT OF MANDATE WILL LIE TO ‘COMPEL THE \n46 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nPERFORMANCE OF AN ACT WHICH THE LAW SPECIFICALLY ENJOINS, AS A \nDUTY RESULTING FROM AN OFFICE, TRUST, OR STATION’ (cid:0) IN CASES \n‘WHERE THERE IS NOT A PLAIN, SPEEDY, AND ADEQUATE REMEDY, IN THE \nORDINARY COURSE OF LAW.’ [A] WRIT WILL NOT LIE TO CONTROL \nDISCRETION CONFERRED UPON A PUBLIC OFFICER OR AGENCY. TWO \nBASIC REQUIREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE WRIT: (1) \nA CLEAR, PRESENT AND USUALLY MINISTERIAL DUTY UPON THE PART OF \nTHE RESPONDENT AND (2) A CLEAR, PRESENT AND BENEFICIAL RIGHT IN \nTHE PETITIONER TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT DUTY. (cid:0) MANDATE WILL \nNOT ISSUE TO COMPEL ACTION UNLESS IT IS SHOWN “THE DUTY TO DO \nTHE THING ASKED FOR IS PLAIN AND UNMIXED WITH DISCRETIONARY \nPOWER OR THE EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT.” THE COURT HAS REVIEWED \nTHE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION SEEKING A WRIT TO COMPEL DEFENDANTS \nTO CARRY OUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LANTERMAN ACT. THE \nCOURT FINDS THAT THE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS DO NOT DEFINE \nWITH ANY SPECIFICITY THE DUTIES THAT DEFENDANTS ARE TO PERFORM. \nTHE GENERAL NATURE OF THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION PRECLUDES WRIT \nRELIEF. WOMEN ORGANIZED FOR EMPLOYMENT V. STEIN (1980) 114 CAL. \nAPP. 3D 133, 139-140. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATUTES \nAND REGULATIONS COULD BE CONSTRUED TO PROVIDE DIRECTION TO \nDEFENDANTS, THE DIRECTION REQUIRES DEFENDANTS TO EXERCISE THEIR \nDISCRETION. AGAIN, THIS PRECLUDES WRIT RELIEF. SKLAR V. FRANCHISE \nTAX BOARD (1986) 185 CAL. APP. 3D 616. 626. PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT A \nGRANT OF THIS MOTION AND THE DENIAL OF WRIT RELIEF WOULD BE \nCONTRARY TO ASSOCIATION FOR RETARDED CITIZENS (ARC) V. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES (1985) 38 CAL. 3D 384, \nWHERE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT IN A BUDGET CRISIS \nTHE DIRECTOR OF THE DDS COULD NOT ORDER THAT FUNDS BE SPENT ON \nPRIORITY SERVICES TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER SERVICES AND INSTEAD \nHAD TO FUND ALL THE SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE LANTERMAN ACT \nUNTIL THE MONEY RAN OUT. PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT ARC SUPPORTS THE \nPROPOSITION THAT THE LANTERMAN ACT REQUIRES DISCRETE ACTS THAT \nCAN BE ENFORCED BY THE COURTS. THE COURT FINDS ARC \nDISTINGUISHABLE ON TWO GROUNDS. FIRST, IT AROSE IN THE CONTEXT \nOF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, NOT A WRIT, SO IT DID NOT ADDRESS \nTHE LIMITATIONS OF WRIT RELIEF PRESENTED IN THIS CASE. SECOND, THE \nCOURT WAS ENJOINING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SPENDING DIRECTIVES \nFROM THE DDS TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS, NOT MANDATING THE DDS \nAND THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES. IN \nADDITION, ARC AFFIRMS THAT ALTHOUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE \nNO DISCRETION AT ALL IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO IMPLEMENT AN \nIPP, THEY HAVE “WIDE DISCRETION” IN DETERMINING HOW TO \nIMPLEMENT IT. SEE 62 OP. ATTY GEN. CAL. 229, 630 (”THE LEGISLATURE \nHAS INDICATED THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE TO HAVE WIDE \nDISCRETION IN DETERMINING THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY PROVIDE \nTHEIR SERVICES” AND “APPROVAL BY THE DEPARTMENT [OF PURCHASES \nBY THE REGIONAL CENTERS] WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE LEGISLATIVE \nINTENT EXPRESSED IN SECTION 4648 SUBDIVISION (B) THAT THE \nREGIONAL CENTERS DETERMINE WHAT SERVICES TO PURCHASE TO BEST \nACCOMPLISH A CLIENT’S PROGRAM PLAN.”) THE COURT HOLDS ONLY \nTHAT PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT MANDATE ENFORCEMENT OF THE \nLANTERMAN ACT THROUGH A WRIT PROCEEDING UNDER CCP 1085. THE \nCOURT DOES NOT ADDRESS WHETHER DEFENDANTS ARE IN COMPLIANCE \n47 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nWITH THE LANTERMAN ACT OR WHETHER IT CAN BE ENFORCED \nTHROUGH OTHER MEANS. THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION IS DISMISSED. \nDocket Entry: TR - MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION - GRANTED \n \n11/06/2003    Document Description: THIS TENTATIVE RULING IS ISSUED BY JUDGE       \n  RONALD M. SABRAW THE MOTION OF REGIONAL CENTER OF ORANGE \nCOUNTY TO JOIN IN MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION IS GRANTED. \nTHE UNDERLYING MOTION WAS GRANTED. Docket Entry: TR - MOTION \nFOR JOINDER - GRANTED \n \n03/28/2003    Document Description: THIS TENTATIVE RULING IS ISSUED BY JUDGE       \n  RONALD M. SABRAW MOTION OF PLAINTIFF TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF \nDOCUMENTS WAS INITIALLY HEARD ON OCTOBER 24, 2002, AND THE \nMOTION WAS THEN REFERRED TO DISCOVERY REFEREE KATHERINE \nGALLO. MS. GALLO HAS SUBMITTED HER RECOMMENDATION TO THE \nCOURT AND DEFENDANTS HAVE OBJECTED TO THE RECOMMENDATION. \nTHE COURT HAS READ (1) THE RECOMMENDATION OF MS. GALLO, AND \n(2) THE BRIEFING AND EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY THE PARTIES IN SUPPORT \nOF AND OPPOSING THE RECOMMENDATION. THE COURT HAS REVIEWED \nTHE DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO MS. GALLO. AS REQUIRED BY ROCKWELL \nINTERNAT. CORP. V. SUPERIOR COURT (1994) 26 CAL. APP. 4TH 1255, \n1269-1270, THE COURT HAS INDEPENDENTLY CONSIDERED THE REFEREE’S \nFINDINGS AND THE OBJECTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PARTIES BEFORE \nACCEPTING OR REJECTING THE REFEREE’S RECOMMENDATIONS. THE \nCOURT HAS CONSIDERED THE FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN EVIDENCE CODE \n1040(B)(2) AND WEIGHED (1) THE STATE’S NECESSITY FOR PRESERVING \nTHE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION WITH (2) THE NECESSITY \nFOR DISCLOSURE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. THE STATE HAS ARGUED \nTHAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, INCLUDING ITS AGENCIES AND \nDEPARTMENTS, MUST BE ABLE TO DISCUSS PRIORITIES AND BUDGET \nPROPOSALS CANDIDLY WITHOUT PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THE STATE NOTES \nTHAT THERE IS EXTENSIVE LOBBYING AND DISCLOSURES IN THE \nLEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THE STATE ALSO ASSERTS THAT THIS CASE \nCONCERNS HOW THE DDS ACTUALLY USES ITS ALLOCATED MONEY, NOT \nWHAT THE DDS MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH MORE MONEY IF IT HAD BEEN \nALLOCATED. PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT THE INFORMATION SOUGHT IS \nRELEVANT TO THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE THE DDS’S BUDGET DOCUMENTS \nDEMONSTRATE WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE RELEVANT STATE \nAGENCY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED AND HOW THEY PROPOSED TO USE \nTHOSE RESOURCES. PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER WAY \nTO GET THIS INFORMATION. THE COURT HAS CONSIDERED THAT \nPLAINTIFFS MUST SHOW HEIGHTENED RELEVANCE TO OVERCOME THE \nCLAIM OF PRIVILEGE, NOT JUST REGULAR C.C.P. 2017(A) RELEVANCE. THE \nCOURT HAS CONSIDERED THAT THE STATE’S EXECUTIVE BRANCH MUST BE \nABLE TO HAVE CANDID INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS, AND HAS NOT ORDERED \nTHE STATE TO PRODUCE CORRESPONDENCE, E-MAILS, AND SIMILAR \nDOCUMENTS. THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT FORMAL PROPOSALS AND \nRESPONSES BE PRODUCED BECAUSE THEY CONSTITUTE THE CONSIDERED \nAND MORE FORMAL POSITIONS OF THE RELEVANT AGENCIES AND \nDEPARTMENTS. THE COURT FINDS THAT PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO OTHER WAY \nTO GET THIS INFORMATION. THE COURT ADOPTS RECOMMENDATION # 3 \nOF DISCOVERY REFEREE KATHERINE GALLO, WITH THE FOLLOWING \nEXCEPTIONS: (1) PAGE 35:23-25 IS CHANGED TO STATE THAT PLAINTIFFS \n48 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST v. DEPARTMENT OF..., 2002038715 (2002)   \n \n \nMUST SERVE A LIST OF ALL DOCUMENTS THEY CLAIM ARE NOT IN \nCOMPLIANCE WITH C.C.P. 2031(G) WITHIN 14 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE \nDOCUMENT FROM THE STATE, AND (2) PAGE 36:1-5 IS CHANGED TO \nSTATE THAT THE STATE MUST PRODUCE THE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS \nAND AN AMENDED PRIVILEGE LOG IN COMPLIANCE WITH C.C.P. 2031(G) \n14 DAYS OF SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. THEREFORE, THE UNDERLYING \nMOTION OF PLAINTIFFS IS GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \nDEFENDANT IS DIRECTED TO CONTACT THE CLERK OF DEPARTMENT 22 AT \n(510) 272-6157 TO ARRANGE A PICK UP DATE FOR THE DOCUMENTS THAT \nWERE SUBMITTED TO THE DISCOVERY REFEREE KATHERINE GALLO AND IN \nTURN, GIVEN TO THE COURT.

      "text": "CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, Plaintiff(s), v. DEPARTMENT..., 2002 WL 32820139...   \n \n \n \n \n2002 WL 32820139 (Cal.Superior) (Trial Motion, Memorandum and Affidavit) \nSuperior Court of California. \nLos Angeles County \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, Plaintiff(s), \nv. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, Defendant(s). \nNo. 02-038715. \nJuly 10, 2002. \nOrder \nDemurrer to Complaint Overruled \nProtection & Advocacy Inc., Attn: Goldblatt, Ellen S., 433 Hegenberger Road, Suite 220, Oakland, CA 94621 \nState of California - Attorney General’s, Office, Attn; Carson, Susan M, 455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000, San \nFrancisco, CA 94102-7004 \nThe Demurrer to Complaint filed for Department of Developmental Services (DDS) was set for hearing on 06/13/2002 at \n10:00 AM in Department 22 before the Honorable Ronald M, Sabraw, The Tentative Ruling was published and was \ncontested. \n  \nThe matter was argued and submitted, and good cause appearing therefore, \n  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: \nThe tentative ruling is affirmed as follows: Demurrer of Defendants to the Petition for Writ of Mandate and Verified \nComplaint is decided as follows: \n  \nDemurrers to fifth cause of action alleging violation of state constitutional rights (paras 251-254) the sixth cause of action \nalleging violation of federal constitutional rights (paras 255-261) are OVERRULED. \n  \nThe fifth and sixth causes of action each commingle several different theories of constitutional law. The state law claim \nconcerns the right to personal liberty under Article 1, Section 1, substantive and procedural due process under Article 1, \nSections 1 and 7(a), equal protection under Article 1, Section 7(a), and the right of association under Article 1, Section 7(a). \nThe federal law claim concerns substantive and procedural due process and the liberty interest under the due process clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, the right of association under the First Amendment, and equal protection under the equal \nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n  \nOn a demurrer, the Court may not parse Plaintiff’s claims. A demurrer must eliminate an entire cause of action and does not \nlie to a portion of a cause of action. PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1680, 1682-83. Therefore, a cause \nof action survives if any portion of the cause of action survives. \n  \nDefendants argue, accurately, that individuals do not have a Constitutional due process right to be placed in the least \nrestrictive environment or in a community setting. The Constitution does require, however, that professional make a reasoned \nrecommendation to place an individual in a restricted environment. The Constitution requires that “the courts make certain \nthat professional judgment in fact was exercised.” Youngberg v. Romeo (1982) 457 U.S. 307, 319-320. The Petition and \nComplaint allege that professionals fail to conduct adequate assessments and fail to do individualized program planning. \n1 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, Plaintiff(s), v. DEPARTMENT..., 2002 WL 32820139...   \n \n \n(Complaint at 111, 113d, 172-175.) \n  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot assert a Constitutional claim that individuals cannot be placed in institutions if \nrequired by budgetary and resource constraints. Addressing Constitutional and ADA claims, the Court in Williams v. \nWasserman (D.Md. 2001) 164 F. Supp. 2d 591, 627, held “While the State may not confine patients to mental institutions \nwho do not belong there simply because it is financially or politically expedient to do so... it is sufficient if a state acts \nreasonably to implement community placement, without arbitrary or undue delay in light of legitimate budget constraints and \nthe competing demands of other disabled citizens.” Plaintiffs argue that other federal courts have held that professional \njudgment may be lacking if either the professional decision or the actual placement after a decision is made are based on the \navailability of resources. Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty (W.D.N.C. 1988) 699 F.Supp. 1178, 1195 and 1202 (para 10) \n(Noting “tendency among human service professionals in the state psychiatric institutions to conform their recommendations \nfor treatment or habilitation of class members to the constraints imposed by the state’s inadequate service delivery system, \nrather than to exercise true professional judgment.”); Lelsz v. Kavanagh (N.D, Tex. 1987) 673 F. Supp. 828, 835 (“When \nprofessionally acceptable judgments are not effectuated because of administrative ineptitude or insufficient funds, the \ninadequacy of care is not removed from judicial purview simply because the initial judgments made by professionals were \nproper.”) The Petition and Complaint allege that defendants place individuals based on resource and fiscal restraints rather \nthan professional judgment. (Complaint at 111, 113e and f, 164-171, 176-180.) \n  \nThere is little California law directly addressing the Constitutional issues raised in this complaint. Therefore, prudence \ndictates that the demurer be overruled so the Court can visit the issue on a fully developed factual record. In addition, \nvirtually  all  of  the  California  and  Federal  case  law  on  the  subject  of  the  due  process  implications  of  medical \ninstitutionalization is at the summary judgment or trial phase. Therefore, the Court holds that the Complaint adequately states \ndue process claims under the California and United States Constitutions. \n  \nHaving found that the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action adequately allege due process claims, the Court does not need to \nreach whether Plaintiff has adequately plead claims regarding equal protection and the right to association. \n  \nThe State of California is a proper party to the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action. Under the \nLanterman  Development  Disabilities  Services  Act,  the  State  of  California  accepts  a  responsibility  for  persons  with \ndevelopmental disabilities and an obligation with it much discharge. Welf & Inst. Code § 4501; Association for Retarded \nCitizens v. Department of Developmental Services (1985) 38 Cal,3d 384, 393 (“[T]he [Lanternan] Act clearly defines the \nright of the developmentally disabled person to be provided with services and the corresponding obligation of the state to \nprovide them. Indeed, sections 4501 and 4502 clearly speak in terms of the responsibility of the state and the rights of \npersons with developmental disabilities.”) \n  \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n2 \n ",

      "title": "State Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Affirmative Defenses",
      "text": " \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3667292...   \n \n \n \n \n2006 WL 3667292 (Cal.Superior) (Trial Motion, Memorandum and Affidavit) \nSuperior Court of California. \nAlameda County \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, \nv. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES (DDS), et al., Defendants. \nNo. 2002-038715. \nJanuary 11, 2006. \nComplex Litigation \nState Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Affirmative Defenses \nJudge: Ronald M. Sabraw. \nI. INTRODUCTION \n  \nPlaintiffs have moved for judgment on the pleadings as to each of the 14 affirmative defenses pled in State defendants’ \nAnswer to the Fifth Amended Complaint.1 The motion is made on the ground that each affirmative defense fails to state facts \nsufficient to constitute a defense. Code Civ. Proc. § 438(c)(1)(A).2 The motion is curious for at least two reasons. First, each \naffirmative defense includes (but is generally not limited to) the standard language used to plead these defenses. While this \nmay leave defendants open to the charge of using “boilerplate” language, the language is “boilerplate” precisely because it \nhas successfully served the function, in thousands of cases, of giving the plaintiffs in those cases adequate notice of the \ndefenses raised. \n  \nSecond, each of the 14 affirmative defenses were among the 24 affirmative defenses pled in response to the original \ncomplaint. Plaintiffs propounded form interrogatories which addressed, inter alia, the factual basis for each defense. State \ndefendants served Supplemental Responses to those interrogatories in May 2003.3 Plaintiffs voiced no dissatisfaction with \nthese answers and did not bring a motion to compel additional responses. (Hewitt Decl., ¶ 4.) Accordingly, it is fair to assume \nthat plaintiffs believed they had obtained a satisfactory statement of the factual basis for each defense. Although this \ndiscovery may not legally preclude plaintiffs from bringing a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on purported \ndeficiencies in the factual allegations supporting each defense, it certainly calls into question exactly what is being \naccomplished by the present motion, other than extra and wholly unnecessary work for the court and the defendants. \n  \nII. ARGUMENT \nA. Legal Standard. \nAs plaintiffs correctly point out, the same legal standard applies when testing the sufficiency of an affirmative defense as \napplies in determining whether a cause of action is stated. In determining the sufficiency of pleadings, California courts are \nbecoming increasing liberal - in some cases approximating the notice pleading standards of federal courts. Weil & Brown, \n1 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3667292...   \n \n \nCal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial ¶ 6:128 (2005). The objective is to provide fair notice of the claim or defense being \nasserted. “There is no need to require specificity in pleadings because ‘modern discovery procedures necessarily affect the \namount of detail which should be required in pleading.’ Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719.” Ludgate Ins. \nCo. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608. Similarly, the level of specificity required depends on the \nlevel of knowledge which the opposing party can be assumed to have. Jackson v. Pasadena City School Dist. (1963) 39 \nCal.2d 876, 879 (“The particularity required in pleading facts depends on the extent to which the defendant in fairness needs \ndetailed information that can be conveniently provided the plaintiff; less particularity is required where he defendant may be \nassumed to have knowledge of the facts equal to that possessed by the plaintiff. [Citation.]”) In this regard, there is no dispute \nthat Protection and Advocacy, Inc., one of plaintiffs’ attorneys, is unquestionably extremely knowledgeable about programs \nfor persons with developmental disabilities in California. \n  \nB. The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Should Be Denied. \nDuring four years of litigation, plaintiffs have already undertaken extensive discovery, including discovery directed at the \naffirmative defenses, and therefore can be assumed to have knowledge of the pertinent facts. Consequently, fair notice does \nnot require a more particularized statement of the affirmative defenses. On this ground alone, the motion for judgment on the \npleadings should be denied. \n  \nA review of each affirmative defense further confirms this conclusion.4 \n  \n1. Failure to state a cause of action. \nThis defense presents only legal issues, i.e, the legal sufficiency of the facts pled by plaintiffs to state the various causes of \naction alleged in the complaint. It does not turn on facts alleged, or not alleged, by defendants. Consequently, the defense \ncannot be challenged on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. Moreover, plaintiffs cite no \nauthority for their contention that the defense must specify, for each cause of action, the element of the cause of action that is \nallegedly “missing.” (Plaintiffs’ Memo, p. 2:13-15.) Clearly, plaintiffs have no need for this information in the answer. If \ndefendants bring a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to one or more causes of action, plaintiffs will know what the \nalleged legal deficiency is and will have a full opportunity to respond. \n  \n2. Waiver, estoppel. \nPlaintiffs memorandum at pages 2-3 inexcusably fails to quote the entire Second Affirmative Defense, which alleges waiver \nand estoppel. In its entirety, that defense states “Certain plaintiffs and putative class members have waived, relinquished, and \nor abandoned, and are equitably estopped to assert any claim for relief against State Defendants regarding the allegations \ncontained in the Complaint because, inter alia, they have elected to stay in institutions and/or have explicitly or impliedly \nrefused community placement.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion, the actual language of the \naffirmative defense does assert the facts which provide the grounds for asserting waiver and/or estoppel. \n  \n3. Res judicata/collateral estoppel. \nAs the third affirmative defense states, the res judicata/collateral estoppel defense is based on the decision in Sanchez v. \nJohnson, a decision with which the plaintiffs are completely familiar. Whether, and to what extent, the final judgment in that \ncase (which has now been affirmed by the Ninth Circuit) precludes this action is almost entirely a question of law. To \nrequire, as plaintiffs suggest, that defendants plead the particular elements of res judicata and collateral estoppel would \naccomplish nothing. Rather, it would essentially require that the issues be briefed in the answer. As written, the affirmative \n2 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3667292...   \n \n \ndefense gives plaintiffs fair notice. If State defendants bring a motion based on these theories, plaintiffs will be able to \nrespond. \n  \n4. Uncertainty. \nThe defense of uncertainty asserts that some of the complaint’s allegations, as pled, are not sufficiently definite and \ncomprehensible. The defense therefore presents only legal issues and does not turn on facts alleged or not alleged by \ndefendants. Moreover, the defense, as written, identifies particular paragraphs of the complaint which are allegedly uncertain. \nThe defense thus provides adequate notice to plaintiffs. \n  \n5. Claims subject to other actions already pending. \nThis defense is based on the fact that some of the plaintiffs and putative class members have writ proceedings pending or \nresolved. However, because plaintiffs have represented to the court that they are not seeking to establish liability or obtain \nrelief on behalf of individual plaintiffs or individual putative class members, State defendants drop this defense without \nprejudice. \n  \n6. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies. \nThis defense is based on plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust the fair hearing procedures established by the Lanterman Act. Again, \nbecause plaintiffs have consistently stated that they are not seeking to establish liability or obtain relief on behalf of \nindividual plaintiffs or individual putative class members, State defendants drop this defense without prejudice. \n  \n7. No equitable relief/adequate remedy at law. \nAlthough the Seventh Affirmative Defense does not expressly state the nature of plaintiffs’ adequate legal remedy that \nforecloses equitable relief, it has been no secret from the outset of this case that defendants contend that the fair hearing \nprocedures in the Lanterman Act provide named plaintiffs and putative class members with an adequate means of insuring \nthat they are placed in the appropriate and least restrictive environment - the sole objective of the “systemic” injunctive and \nequitable relief sought by plaintiffs. If the court deems it necessary, State defendant will amend the Seventh Affirmative \nDefense to so state. \n  \n8. Statute of limitations. \nThe uncertainty about which of defendants’ alleged actions or omissions will be asserted by plaintiffs in their attempt to \nestablish liability results in uncertainty about the dates those actions or omissions occurred. Consequently, it is virtually \nimpossible to plead the statute of limitations defense with more specificity. However, if the court deems it necessary, State \ndefendants request permission to amend the Eighth Affirmative Defense to plead the code sections which could give rise to a \nstatute of limitations defense. \n  \n9. Fundamental alteration. \n3 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3667292...   \n \n \nAgain plaintiffs’ memorandum inexcusably fails to quote the entire Ninth Affirmative Defense. That defense states “The \nrelief, as sought in the Petition/Complaint, is barred because it would require State Defendants to fundamentally alter \nsubstantial portions of California’s services and programs because, inter alia, to provide the class-wide relief sought by \nplaintiffs relating to community placement and related issues would result in the allocation of available resources that is \ninequitable, given the responsibility the State Defendants have undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse \npopulation of persons with developmental disabilities, as well as other persons dependent on the State for all or part of their \ncare.” When the language of the entire defense is examined, it is clear that it properly pleads the ultimate facts which support \nthe assertion that the relief sought would result in a fundamental alteration under the standards set forth in Olmstead v. L.C., \n527 U.S. 581, 605-606 (1999). It should also be noted that a more detailed statement of the facts supporting the defense is not \npossible now because plaintiffs have articulated widely varied versions of the relief they would seek everything from a \nrequest for a non-specific order simply requiring defendants to develop a “plan” for deinstitutionalization to the very \nparticularized relief pled in the prayer. Finally, the extent to which the fundamental alteration defense may apply to causes of \naction other than the ADA raises legal issues which need not be addressed in the affirmative defense, and, in any event, are \nnot subject to challenge for an alleged failure to pled sufficient facts to state a defense. \n  \n10. Conduct of other persons. \nWhether or not “the conduct of other persons” is an affirmative defense, the assertion is adequately pled in light of plaintiffs’ \nknowledge of how the system of care for persons with developmental disabilities is structured in California and in light of the \nanswers to form interrogatories. (See Exh. B to the Hewitt Decl.) As plaintiffs are obviously aware and as the interrogatory \nanswers make explicit, the functions of assessment, community resource development, and community placement - matters at \nthe heart of plaintiffs’ claims - are carried out under the Lanterman Act primarily by the regional centers. Whether, and to \nwhat extent, this fact is a defense to State defendants’ possible liability under one or more of the 68 provisions of the \nLanterman Act, or the other statues or constitutional provisions that have been allegedly violated, is a legal issue that is not \nrequired to be briefed in the answer. \n  \n11. No ministerial duties. \nWhether a duty is “ministerial” and therefore subject to mandate under section 1085 is a legal issue and thus does not depend \non any factual allegations alleged in the affirmative defense. Moreover, defendants take the position that each of the alleged \n“actions” pled in paragraph 230 of the Lanterman Act claim and in the Medicaid cause of action (i.e., those matters allegedly \nsubject to mandate) are not ministerial. Therefore, even if there is some requirement to identify the specific actions in the \naffirmative defense as plaintiffs assert, that has been accomplished. \n  \n12. Relief inconsistent with Medicaid state plan. \nThis affirmative defense raises a legal issue - is the relief sought inconsistent, as a matter of law, with the federally mandated \nMedicaid state plan. Until plaintiffs settle on the exact relief they plan to seek, defendants cannot, and should not, be required \nto be more specific. \n  \n13. Failure to demonstrate entitlement to services. \nIf this is not an affirmative defense, but a denial of specific factual allegations in the complaint, as contended by plaintiffs, \nthen it is simply surplusage and arguably subject to a motion to strike, but not subject to a motion for judgment on the \npleadings based on an alleged failure to allege sufficient facts to constitute a defense. In addition, it is State defendants’ \nposition that each plaintiff is being provided the services and supports to which he/she is entitled, as set forth in his/her IPP. \n4 \n \n\n \n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3667292...   \n \n \nTherefore, more detailed factual allegations are unnecessary to give plaintiffs adequate notice of defendants’ position. This is \nespecially true given the lack of specificity in the complaint about the alleged services and support each plaintiff has \npurportedly been denied. In short, generalities beget generalities. \n  \n14. All placements appropriate. \nJudgment on the pleadings should be denied on this affirmative defense for the same reasons it should be denied on the \nThirteenth Affirmative Defense. \n  \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings on each of State defendants’ 14 affirmative defenses \nshould be denied. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  A copy of the portion of State Defendants’ Answer setting forth the affirmative defenses is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration \n  of Henry Hewitt in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on Affirmative DEFENSES (“Hewitt Decl.”) \n \n2  See Plaintiffs’ Memo, p. 2:4-7. \n   \n3  A copy of the portion of the Supplemental Responses addressing the affirmative defenses is attached as Exhibit B to the Hewitt \n  Declaration. The responses are titled by the number of the affirmative defenses. Because the numbering changed with the reduction \ndefenses from 24 to 14, the current numbers are shown in handwriting next to corresponding number in the responses. For \nexample, current affirmative defense No. 5 was No.7 in the original answer and in the answers to form interrogatories. \n \n4  If the court grants the motion as to any of the affirmative defenses, State defendants request that the court grant them leave to \n  amend. \n \n \n   \n \n \n5 \n ",

On April 24, Judge Robert Freedman granted final approval of the \nsettlement agreement in Capitol People First et al v. Department of Developmental \nServices et al.  \n \nDavid Engberg, president of the self-advocacy organization and lead organizational \nplaintiff Capitol People First said, \"This lawsuit was a voice for people in institutions \nwho couldn't speak for themselves.”   \n \nThe case was litigated by Disability Rights California, with Bingham McCutchen LLP \nand DLA Piper US LLP as pro bono counsel.  Barbara Dickey, lead attorney from \nDisability Rights California, explained, “The settlement terms spell out coordinated and \nlong-term actions to support each and every institutionalized Californian with \ndevelopmental disabilities who chooses to live in a smaller, more integrated community \nsetting.” \n \nThe settlement will benefit all people with developmental disabilities in California who \nreside in, or are at risk of placement in, institutions-- defined in the lawsuit as public or \nprivately-run facilities for 16 or more individuals.  The settlement will continue and \nimprove efforts made by the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and the 21 \nRegional Center defendants during the course of the seven-year litigation, which \ninclude expansion of funding and opportunities for community living, as well as the \nrecent closure of one state-run institution, Agnews Developmental Center. \n \nThe settlement provides for additional funds for case management to assist class \nmembers in state-run institutions called developmental centers (DC); improved \ninformation to class members and training for DC staff about community living options; \nincreased state-level coordination of services for people diagnosed with developmental \n\nand mental health disabilities; and continued funding and program efforts to provide \ncommunity living alternatives for class members. \n \nChris O’Connor, attorney with Bingham McCutchen, said of the settlement, “Today \ncaps seven years of work towards finding the best possible ways for the state of \nCalifornia to fulfill the promise made to Californians with developmental disabilities \nunder the state’s Lanterman Act, which requires that people with developmental \ndisabilities must have the opportunity to live in community settings where appropriate.” \n \nDLA Piper attorney Michael Schwartz added: “We are pleased that this settlement \nsignificantly enhances community living options for people with developmental \ndisabilities and also provides improvements to the infrastructure of these programs.”   \n \nThe lawsuit was filed in January 2002, seeking to ensure that Californians with \ndevelopmental disabilities had access to the services they need to live in and \nparticipate as members of their communities, and avoid unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. The class includes the approximately 2,300 children and adults who \nlive in DCs and the 4,500 people who live in privately-owned institutions housing 16 or \nmore, such as skilled nursing facilities and other large congregate facilities.    \n \nThe lawsuit was brought in Alameda County Superior Court by sixteen individual \nplaintiffs who resided in, or were at risk of placement in, developmental centers or \nother institutions; three organizational plaintiffs (Capitol People First, California Alliance \nfor Inclusive Communities, and The Arc of California); and two taxpayer plaintiffs who \nasserted that the State is spending tax dollars unlawfully by continuing to \ninstitutionalize individuals who could live successfully in community homes. \n \nTony Anderson of The Arc of California said, “This settlement will give consumers and \ntheir families more information to make choices about receiving the services they need \nto live healthy and successful lives in their home communities.” \n \nThe lawsuit was settled against all defendants, including the State of California; the \nDepartments of Developmental Services (DDS), Health Care Services (DHCS), Mental \nHealth (DMH); and the 21 local non-profit Regional Centers (which contract with DDS).  \nIn addition, the Intervenors, California Association of State Hospital Parent Councils for \nthe Retarded (CASH/PCR), California Association for the Retarded (CAR), and several \nindividual DC residents, by way of their family members, also support and have signed \nthe settlement agreement. \n \n \n \n \nFor more information and background, go to www.disabilityrightsca.org. \n \n ",

This case presents the important question of the \nability of plaintiffs to pursue broad injunctive relief class actions. \nAmici are California nonprofit organizations dedicated to advancing and \nprotecting the civil rights of minority groups, persons with disabilities, and other \nclasses protected by anti-discrimination laws through the class action process. \nAmicus The Impact Fund is a nonprofit foundation that provides funding, \ntraining, and co-counsel to public interest litigators across the country, assisting in \nemployment discrimination and other cases.  It offers training programs, advice \nand counseling, and amicus representation to nonprofit organizations regarding \nclass action and related issues.  It is also a California State Bar Legal Services \nTrust Fund Support Center, and provides services to legal services projects across \nthe state.  The Impact Fund is Lead Counsel in Dukes v.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., \n222 F.R.D. 137 (N.D. Cal. 2002), and other major class action lawsuits. \nAmicus American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California is the \nregional affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, a nationwide, nonprofit \nnonpartisan membership organization dedicated to the defense and promotion of \nthe guarantees of individual liberties secured by the federal and state constitutions. \nAmicus Asian Pacific American Legal Center is the largest, most diverse \nlegal service and civil rights organizations focusing on Asian Pacific Americans in \nthe United States.  Since its founding in 1983, its legal and community services \nhave had a far reaching impact at the local level, where much of its work is \n\nfocused, as well as at the state and national level, particularly in the areas of \nemployment discrimination, voting rights, and language rights. \nAmicus Equal Rights Advocates is a San Francisco-based human and civil \nrights organization dedicated to protecting and securing equal rights and economic \nopportunities for women and girls through litigation and advocacy.  Since its \ninception in 1974 as a teaching law firm focused on sex-based discrimination, \nERA has undertaken difficult impact litigation that has resulted in establishing \nnew law and provided significant benefits to large groups of women. \nAmicus Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay \nArea is a civil rights and legal services organization devoted to advancing the \nrights of people of color, low-income individuals, immigrants and refugees, and \nother underrepresented persons.  The Lawyers' Committee is affiliated with the \nLawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington, D.C. which was \ncreated at the behest of President Kennedy in 1963.  In 1968, the Lawyers' \nCommittee was established by leading members of the private bar in San \nFrancisco. \nAmicus Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund is the \nleading nonprofit Latino litigation, advocacy and educational outreach institution \nin the United States.  Established in 1968, MALDEF's mission is to foster sound \npublic policies, laws and programs to safeguard the civil rights of the 40 million \nLatinos living in the United States and to empower the Latino community to fully \nparticipate in our society.  MALDEF achieves its mission by concentrating its \nefforts in the areas of employment, education, immigration, and political access. \nMALDEF has litigated numerous class action cases since the organization's \nfounding. \nAmicus Public Advocates, Inc. is a nonprofit, public interest law firm and \none of the oldest public interest law firms in the nation.  Public Advocates uses \ndiverse litigation and non-litigative strategies to handle exclusively policy and \nimpact cases to challenge the persistent, underlying causes and effects of poverty \n2 \n\nand discrimination.  Public Advocates was co-counsel in Serrano v. Priest, 18 Cal. \n3d 728 (1976), a major class action lawsuit seeking injunctive relief. \nAmicus Western Center on Law and Poverty is California's oldest and \nlargest state support center for the State's neighborhood legal aid programs.  The \nWestern Center has frequently brought and won class actions on behalf of \nthousands of persons in suits with statewide impact.  See, e.g., Serrano v. Priest, \n18 Cal. 3d 728 (1976) (invalidating state school finance system); Hunt v. Superior \nCourt, 21 Cal. 4th 984 (1999) (counties must base health care eligibility standards \non ability to pay).  Western Center would not have been capable of achieving \nvictories for these plaintiffs without the ability to bring broad injunctive relief \nclass actions. \nThese organizations and the undersigned attorneys are familiar with the \nquestions involved in this case and the scope of their presentation.  We submit that \nadditional briefing is necessary and appropriate and thus request leave to file the \nattached brief. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBY~ \n~ad \nSeligman \nTHE IMPACT FUND \nAttorney for Amici Curiae \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of \nNorthern California \nAsian Pacific American Legal Center \nEqual Rights Advocates \nLawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of \nthe San Francisco Bay Area \nMexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund \nPublic Advocates \nWestern Center on Law and Poverty \n3 \n\n1  Civil No. 113168 \nst \nIN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA \nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT \nDISTRICT THREE \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., \nPlaintiffs/Petitioners, \nv. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, et al., \nRespondents/Defendants, \nv. \nCALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STATE HOSPITAL/PARENT \nCOUNCILS FOR THE RETARDED, et al., \nIntervenors. \nBRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE THE IMPA  CT FUND, AMERICAN \nCIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, ASIAN \nPACIFIC AMERICAN LEGAL CENTER, EQUAL RIGHTS \nADVOCATES, INC., LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL \nRIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, MEXICAN \nAMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE &  EDUCATION FUND, PUBLIC \nADVOCATES, INC., WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND \nPOVERTY IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER CAPITOL PEOPLE \nFIRST, ET AL. \nPetition from the Superior Court of Alameda County, \nThe Honorable Ronald M.

This conclusion fundamentally \nmisconstrued the nature of this action and should be reversed.  Amici submit this \nbrief because the trial court's error, if not corrected, would make litigation of \nmany critical systemic and pattern and practice cases all but impossible. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THERE ARE NO INDIVIDUAL ISSUES IN A SYSTEMIC \nCLASS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ACTION \nIn assessing whether common questions predominate, the focus must be on \nthe nature of the claim asserted and the theory of recovery.  Sav-On Drug Stores, \nInc. v.  Superior Court, 34 Cal. 4th 319,327 (2004).  In this case, the only relief \nsought is injunctive and declaratory relief.  Such relief is required, plaintiffs \nallege, in part because of California's systemic failure to exercise proper oversight \nand to enforce statutory and regulatory mandates to place class members in less \nrestrictive settings. \nCourts have consistently held that class certification is particularly \nwarranted where the focus of the case is systemic conduct and remedies.  In such \ncases, there are only common questions to resolve.  See Gonzales v. Jones, 116 \nCal. App. 3d 978,984 (1981) (noting that where the harm at issue in the case was \nthe result of a systemic governmental practice, \"only as a class can the rights of all \nthe recipients be protected\"); see also Califano v.  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701 \n(1979) (noting that class certification was appropriate especially where \"[i]t is \nunlikely that differences in the factual background of each claim will affect the \noutcome of the legal issue\"); Armstrong v. Davis,  275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. \n\n2001); Baby Neal ex reI. Kanter v.  Casey, 43 F.3d 48,57 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting \nthat cases in which \"plaintiffs request declaratory and injlmctive relief against a \ndefendant engaging in a common course of conduct toward them, and there is \ntherefore no need for individualized determinations of the propriety of injunctive \nrelief,\" are particularly well-suited for class certification).1 \nThe California Supreme Court noted that \"many cases have recognized that \na class action is a 'peculiarly appropriate' vehicle for providing effective relief \nwhen, as here, a large number of applicants or recipients have been improperly \ndenied governmental benefits on the basis of an invalid regulation, statute or \nadministrative practice.\"  Employment Dev. Dept. v. Superior Court, 30 Cal. 3d \n256,265 (1981) (citing, inter alia, Califano, 442 U.S. at 701; Gonzales, 116 Cal. \nApp. 3d at 984-85).  \"These and many other authorities demonstrate that a class \naction is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some \npoint be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for \nrecovery or as to the amount of his or her damages.\"  Id.  (emphasis added). \nEssentially, plaintiffs' theory in this case is that there has been a pattern and \npractice of failure to meet statutory and regulatory mandates.  See Petitioners' \nOpening Brief at 28-30.  Plaintiffs challenge defendants' systemic policies and \npractices and the systemic effect of those policies and practices on plaintiffs' \nrights under state and federal law.  This claim is not novel-there is a well \nestablished framework for assessing such claims in the class action context. \nThe California Supreme Court has urged trial courts to be procedurally \nI \ninnovative and \"incorporate procedures from outside sources in determining \nwhether to allow the maintenance of a particular class suit. More specifically, we \nhave directed them to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  City of \nSan Jose v.  Superior Court, 12 Cal. 3d 447,453 (1974); see also Sav-On, 34 Cal. \n4th at 339; Bell v. Am. Title Ins.  Co., 226 Cal. App. 3d 1589, 1603 (1991); Lowry \nv.  Obledo, III Cal. App. 3d 14,22 (1980). \n2 \n\nContrary to the trial court's assumption that class relief is precluded by individual \nissues that arise for each class member, such issues do not even arise in assessing \nclass wide liability and injunctive relief. \nThe pattern and practice model was comprehensively described in \nInternational Brotherhood o/Teamsters v.  United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977).2  In \nthat nationwide employment discrimination case, the United States alleged that the \ndefendant company had a pattern and practice of employment discrimination \nagainst minority applicants and would-be applicants for truck driver positions. \nThe Court explained that at the liability stage of the case, the government must \nprove \"more than the mere occurrence of isolated or 'accidental' or sporadic \ndiscriminatory acts.  It had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that \nracial discrimination was the company's standard operating procedure-the \nregular rather than the unusual practice.\" Id at 336.  The government made this \nshowing through a combination of statistical and anecdotal evidence.  Id.  at 337-\n38. \nAt the liability stage of a pattern and practice case, the plaintiffs need not \noffer \nevidence that each person for whom it will ultimately seek relief was \na victim of the employer's discriminatory policy.  Its  burden is  to \nshow  that  such  a  policy  existed.  The  burden  then  shifts  to  the \nemployer to defeat a prima facie showing of a pattern or practice by \ndemonstrating that the  Government's proof is  either inaccurate or \ninsignificant. \nId.  at 360. \nThe point is that at the liability stage of a pattern or practice trial, the \nfocus  often  will  not  be  on  individual  hiring  decisions.  While  a \n2 Although Teamsters was not a class action, the Supreme Court has confirmed \nthat \"the elements of a prima facie pattern-or-practice case are the same in a \nprivate class action.\"  Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank, 467 U.S. 867, 876 n.9 (1984). \n3 \n\npattern might be demonstrated by examining the discrete decisions \nof  which  it  is  composed,  the  Government's  suits  have  more \ncommonly  involved  proof of the  expected  result  of a  regularly \nfollowed discriminatory policy. \nld. at 360 n.46.  In other words, the liability stage focuses on the defendant's \npolicy as it applies to the entire class. \nIf the defendant fails to rebut the prima facie case, liability is established \nand the trial court determines the appropriate remedy.  \"Without any further \nevidence from the Government, a court's finding of a pattern or practice justifies \nan award of prospective relief.  Such relief might take the form of an injunctive \norder against continuation of the discriminatory practice ....\"   ld. at 361 \n(emphasis added); see also Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank ofR  ichmond, 467 U.S. \n867, 876 (1984) (\"[A] finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination itself \njustifies an award of prospective relief to the class ....\" ).  Importantly, such relief \nis issued without any requirement of assessing the claims of individual class \nmembers.  If individual relief is sought, \"a district court must usually conduct \nadditional proceedings after the liability phase of the trial to determine the scope \nof individual relief.\"  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 36l.3 \nThe Teamsters pattern and practice approach has been approved by the \nCalifornia Supreme Court.  See Sav-On, 34 Cal. 4th at 333-34 & n.6.  Because \nSav-On was not a discrimination case, the California Supreme Court's \nendorsement of the pattern and practice approach indicates that it is applicable to \nthe full range of potential class cases.  See id. (\"California courts and others have \nin a wide variety of contexts considered pattern and practice evidence, statistical \nIn such additional proceedings, all class members are presumed entitled to relief, \n3 \nbut a defendant can defeat individual relief by proving that an individual was \ndenied an employment opportunity for a lawful reason.  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at \n431-32 \n4 \n\nevidence, sampling evidence, expert testimony and other indicators of a \ndefendant's centralized practices in order to evaluate whether common behavior \ntowards similarly situated plaintiffs makes class certification appropriate.\"); see \nalso Alch v.  Superior Court, 122 Cal. App. 4th 339, 379-381 (2004) (applying \nTeamster's pattern and practice theory in California Fair Employment & Housing \nAct case); Reyes v. Bd. a/Supervisors, 196 Cal. App. 3d 1263, 1279 (1987) \n(holding that whether County applied an unlawful process in terminating General \nAssistance benefits did not require examining facts of each class member but \ncould be determined through review of evidence about \"standard practices \nfollowed in making ... decisions, as well as a sampling of representative cases\" \n(emphasis in original)).  Here, too, plaintiffs have offered common evidence of \ndefendants' practices and policies sufficient to establish common factual issues \nand the illegality of defendants' conduct.  E.g.; Petitioners' Opening Brief at 41-\n46.  Plaintiffs' intended use of expert testimony, statistics, and sampling evidence \nis consistent with recognized methods of proof in class litigation.  See, e.g., Sav \nOn, 34 Cal. 4th at 333 & n.6; Reyes, 196 Cal. App. 3d at 1279. \nThe trial court erroneously assumed that \"individual inquiries\" would be \nnecessary in order to provide class relief.4  The court never explained how or why \nsuch individual inquiry would be necessary in order to establish an overall illegal \npolicy or practice, or to issue systemic injunctive relief.  Contrary to the \nassumption of the court, plaintiffs do not seek individualized relief at all.  As \nplaintiffs repeatedly emphasize, they seek only systemic relief; any individual \nentitlement claims would be handled post-judgment through established \nadministrative processes.  E.g., Petitioners' Opening Brief at 32,47. \nThe trial court's decision is ambiguous, however, since the court suggests that an \n4 \n\"alternative approach\" focusing on whether the defendant \"acted or refused to act \non grounds generally applicable to the class\" would establish commonality. \nOpinion at 9.  Inexplicably, however, the court rejected this approach and opted \nfor what it called the \"standard commonality analysis.\"  Id.  at 14. \n5 \n\nIndividual facts may arise where individual relief-such as damages or \nperson-specific injunctive relief-is sought.  That is why \"additional proceedings\" \nmay be necessary in pattern and practice cases where such individual relief is \nsought.  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 361.  In this case, however, no such relief is \nsought.  Just as the cOUli in Teamsters did not need to determine the individual \ndiscrimination claims of class members to issue injunctive relief, the trial court in \nthis case may order systemic relief without addressing whether any individual \nclass member was denied appropriate placement. \nII.  THE TRIAL COURT'S APPROACH WOULD PRECLUDE \nSYSTEMIC RELIEF IN MANY CASES \nThe approach taken by the trial court is inconsistent with many of the \nhistoric systemic class action cases in California.  In Serrano v. Priest, 18 Cal. 3d \n728 (1976) for example, the California Supreme Court affirmed injunctive relief as \na remedy for the state government's systemic failure to finance the public schools \nin a nondiscriminatory manner.  The individual issues relating to each child's \neducational needs were irrelevant to this determination.  Likewise, in Hunt v. \nSuperior Court, 21 Cal. 4th 984 (1999), the Court upheld an injunction requiring a \ncounty to base health care eligibility standards on the ability of residents to pay. \nSee also White v. State of California, 195 Cal. App. 3d 452,456 (1987) (allowing \nclass of developmentally disabled children to pursue claim for injunctive relief \nagainst state officials to remedy failure to spend federal Education for \nHandicapped Children funds on their education).  In each of those cases, \nindividual issues could have been raised, such as the need of each child for \nparticular school services or the ability of residents to pay.  The focus of the \nlitigation, however, was system-wide, and therefore such individual issues were \nirrelevant. \n6 \n\nSimilarly, federal courts recognize that not all cases involving individuals \nnecessarily implicate individual issues.  As the Third Circuit has noted, although it \nmay be true that \"each plaintiff here has his or her own circumstances,\" they all \nshare the common circumstance of being affected by the actions or inactions of the \nstate.  Baby Neal, 43 F .3d at 61.  Such \"[i]ndividual factual differences do not \naffect the central allegation that the [State] violates various statutory and \nconstitutional rights in its provision of child care services to the class.\" Id. \nCourts have also issued broad injunctive relief in many cases such as this \none, involving failure of a governmental entity to enforce statutory obligations on \nthose it supervises.  For example, in Raymond v. Rowland, 220 F.R.D. 173 (D. \nConn. 2004), the district court certified a class seeking broad injunctive relief for \nthe failure of the governmental entity to institute policies and procedures and \notherwise comply with its statutory mandates.  The class of disabled recipients of \nstate aid programs alleged that the Department of Social Services failed to adopt \nand codify policies and procedures to accommodate disabled people in accessing \nand maintaining eligibility for such programs.  The court noted that the plaintiffs \nalleged a \"lack of systemic process\" and therefore satisfied the commonality prong \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).  Id.  at 179.  Furthermore, the court noted \nthat cases \"alleging systemic failure of governmental bodies to properly fulfill \nstatutory requirements\" are appropriate for class certification under Rule 23(b )(2). \nId.  at 181. \nLikewise, a class of homeless children challenged the failure of state and \nlocal governments to fulfill their federal statutory obligations to assure that \nchildren of homeless individuals had access to free and appropriate public \neducation.  Nat'l Law Ctr. on Homelessness & Poverty, R.J v. New York, 224 \nF.R.D. 314, 316-18 (E.D.N.Y. 2004).  Again, because the plaintiffs challenged \n7 \n\nsystemic failure of government entities to comply with and enforce their statutory \nmandates, and because the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to rectify that \nproblem, class certification was appropriate. \nIn Young v.  Pierce, 544 F. Supp. 1010 (E.D. Tex. 1982), plaintiffs \nchallenged the failure of the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) to operate a program for subsidized housing that was free of \nracial discrimination.  Although HUD did not actively segregate subsidized \nhousing, its inaction perpetuated a system of segregation.  Id.  at 1030-31.  The \ndistrict court granted injunctive relief against HUD.  Young v. Pierce, 640 F. Supp. \n1476 (E.D. Tex. 1986).5  Similarly, in Miller v.  Carson, 563 F.2d 757 (lith Cir. \n1977), a broad injunction was granted against state and local officials for failure to \noperate the prisons properly.  As an example, the court granted an injunction \nagainst the Secretary of the Florida Department of Offender Rehabilitation for \nfailure to promulgate rules prescribing standards for the operation of the jail.  Id.  at \n758-59. \nAs these cases demonstrate, class treatment has been approved to remedy \nsystemic discrimination or other governmental failures through class actions and \nsystem-wide injunctions.  In any of these cases, one could have argued that an \nindividual's entitlement to relief turned on individually specific facts.  Yet this \nwas no bar to class certification of injunctive relief claims. \n5 The Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded for reconsideration of the scope of the \ninjunction but did not deny that the injunction was appropriate.  Young v. Pierce, \n822 F.2d 1368 (5th Cir. 1987). \n8 \n\nCONCLUSION \nCalifornia's public policy encourages the use of class actions.  Sav-On, 34 \nCal. 4th at 340.  The need for class litigation is particularly manifest where class \nmembers face systemic problems that cannot be redressed by individual litigation. \nThe trial court order denying class certification should be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy __  _______________  _ \n~~~ \nBra  Seligman \nTHE IMPACT FUND \nAttorney for Amici Curiae \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of \nNorthern California \nAsian Pacific American Legal Center \nEqual Rights Advocates \nLawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of \nthe San Francisco Bay Area \nMexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund \nPublic Advocates \nWestern Center on Law and Poverty \n9 \n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH \nCALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT, RULE 14(c)(1) \nI, BRAD SELIGMAN, declare that: \nI am Executive Director of The Impact Fund, counsel for mnici curiae in \nthe above-captioned case. \nI certifY that the forgoing Brief of Amici Curiae is at least thirteen point \nfont and contains 2520 words, including footnotes,  as  counted by the Microsoft \nWord program used to generate this brief. \nI declare under penalty ofpet:.jury, under the laws of the State of California, \nthat the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on September 27,2006, at Berkeley, CA. \nBrad Seligman \n\nPROOF OF SERVICE \nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA \nCOUNTY OF ALAMEDA \nI, the undersigned do hereby declare that I am over the age of eighteen, and am not \na party to this action.

The proposed class \nincludes the approximately 3,000 regional center consumers who live in \ndevelopmental centers and the 4,500 consumers who live in other large congregate \ninstitutions housing 16 or more including skilled nursing facilities and large private \nICFs and CCFs. \n \nSettlement Agreement Will Result in Opportunities for People to \nReceive More Integrated Supports of Their Choice \n \nThe individual and organizational plaintiffs and Kern, Redwood Coast, Tri-\nCounties, and Valley Mountain Regional Centers are pleased to have arrived at a \nsettlement of the CPF case which they all agree supports the goals of the \nLanterman Act and other laws that people with developmental disabilities should \nlive in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual need.  \n \nIn the Settlement Agreement these four regional centers have agreed to do the \nfollowing over the six year term of the settlement: \n \n•  Reduce Total Number Of DC Residents  -- Assist many of their \ndevelopmental center residents to move to quality community homes with \nthe supports they need and choose and deflect other individuals from DC \nplacement, all through the Community Placement Plan process, such that \neach regional center will have a reduced total number of DC residents at the \nend of six years; \n \n•  Conduct Comprehensive Community Needs Assessments with each of \ntheir consumers who live in other large institutional settings (such as skilled \nnursing facilities, sub-acute facilities, psychiatric hospitals, ICF/DDs and \nCCFs that house 16 or more) over the next four years; \n \n  1\n\n•  Encourage Downsizing -- Meet annually with the operator of each large \nprivate institution serving only people with developmental disabilities in \ntheir service areas to encourage the program to downsize to one or more \nliving arrangements housing no more than six individuals and discuss the \npossibility of obtaining downsizing funding from DDS; and \n \n•  Meet the Needs of Named Plaintiffs -- Provide special help to the named \nplaintiffs served by these regional centers.  \n \nIn exchange, the four regional centers will not have to be part of the CPF litigation. \nThere are additional reporting and technical terms to the settlement. A hearing \nregarding the Settlement Agreement has been scheduled, requesting the court to \nissue a Judgment in the case approving the Settlement Agreement and retaining \njurisdiction over the case during the term of the settlement.   \n \nClass Certification Is Denied and Action is Stayed Pending Appeal \n \nPlaintiffs moved the court to certify the proposed class – meaning that the court \nwould rule the 16 named plaintiffs could pursue the case on behalf of themselves \nand other individuals with common concerns.  Although many similar disability \nrights cases across the nation and in California have been certified for class \ntreatment, unfortunately the trial court in the CPF case denied class certification.  \n   \nPlaintiffs believe the trial court is wrong and have appealed the denial of class \ncertification.  The entire case is on hold, called “stayed”, while the appeals court \nconsiders this issue. There is no definite timeline by which the appeal will be \ndecided, but it could take many more months to be resolved.   \n \nDisability Rights Amici Support Plaintiffs’ Appeal \n \nWe are pleased to report that two amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs have \nbeen filed in support of plaintiffs by prestigious disability rights and legal services \nagencies. These agencies felt strongly that the trial court’s decision denying class \ncertification was wrong.  One amicus brief was submitted by Washington \nProtection and Advocacy System, Public Interest Law Foundation, National \nDisability Rights Network, and Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund.  \nThe other was submitted by the Impact Fund, American Civil Liberties Union of \nNorthern California, Asian Pacific American Legal Center, Equal Rights \nAdvocates, Inc., Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay \n  2\n\nArea, Mexican American Legal Defense & Education Fund, Public Advocates, \nInc., and Western Center on Law and Poverty. \n \nBackground of the Case \n \nThe CPF v. DDS case has been hotly contested for almost five years, with \ndefendants filing dozens of motions and several appeals challenging the case.  At \nthe 2005 Supported Life conference, we reported that after years of wrangling, the \ncourt of appeal had ruled against defendants and had decided to allow plaintiffs’ \nMedicaid and Lanterman Act causes of action to go forward. \n \nToday, over 7,000 people with developmental disabilities still needlessly remain in \nlarge public and private institutions.  The time they lose confined in institutions is \nirretrievable—it is time that could and should be used to acquire skills, develop \nindependence, and participate as members of their communities.  Every year, \nhundreds more find themselves at risk of placement in an institution due to the lack \nof community supports, including crisis intervention services. \n \nThe Plaintiffs \n \n•  The 16 individual plaintiffs seek to represent a class of over 7,000 \nCalifornians with developmental disabilities who reside in, or are at risk of \nplacement in, developmental centers or other institutions and who have \nurgent needs for quality, stable community living arrangements.   \n•  The three organizational plaintiffs are Capitol People First (a self-advocacy \norganization), California Alliance for Inclusive Communities, and Arc \nCalifornia. \n•  The two taxpayer plaintiffs assert that the State is spending tax dollars \nunlawfully by continuing to institutionalize individuals who could live \nsuccessfully in community homes. \n \nThe Defendants \n \nThe lawsuit is filed against the State; the California Health and Human Services \nAgency; the Departments of Developmental Services (DDS), Health Services, \nMental Health, and Finance; and the 21 local non-profit Regional Centers (which \ncontract with DDS). \n \n  3\n\nThe Intervenors  \n \nThe Court granted supporters of the large state developmental centers permission \nto join the lawsuit—called intervention.  Intervenors are CASH-PCR, an \norganization composed, in part, of vendor organizations which broke away from \nCalifornia Arc and several individual developmental center residents—by way of \ntheir family members.  The Judge limited the issues Intervenors are allowed to \nraise in the case to ensuring that the legal ability of parents and guardians to \nparticipate in the planning process and the ability of professionals to recommend \nplacement in developmental centers are not adversely affected by this case. \n \nLegal Theories \n \nThe lawsuit alleges that defendants are violating both state and federal statutory \nand constitutional rights that guarantee people with developmental disabilities the \nchoice and opportunity to live as part of, rather than apart from, our neighborhoods \nand communities.  Plaintiffs’ claims are based on: \n \n•  The Lanterman Act, which the California Supreme Court said creates an \nentitlement to a sufficient array of services to support integration of people \nwith developmental disabilities into the mainstream of community life.  \nAss’n for Retarded Citizens—Cal. V. DDS, 38 Cal.3d 384 (1984). \n \n•  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other state and federal laws \nthat prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability.  The U.S.  Supreme \nCourt ruled that institutionalizing individuals with disabilities when \ncommunity services can meet their needs is disability-based discrimination \nthat violates the ADA.  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \n \n•  Federal Medicaid laws, which require that people be informed of, allowed \nthe choice of, and promptly provided with, community service alternatives. \n \n•  Fundamental state and federal constitutional rights, including the right to \nliberty, privacy, and freedom of association. \n \nF:\\DOCS\\ELLEN\\Supported  Life\\2006\\Capitol People First Update 9-30-06.doc \n \n  4",

Before Trial ¶ 6:459 (2001)  .................................   1 \n   \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe State Defendants’ Answer is defective. It contains fourteen boilerplate affirmative defenses, many of which are not \naffirmative defenses at all, and none of which contain any factual allegations to support them. \n  \nPlaintiffs have a right to know the basis for the State Defendants’ asserted defenses. They cannot conduct meaningful \ndiscovery into those defenses unless and until the State Defendants allege some factual bases to support them. Moreover, \nPlaintiffs do not believe that the State Defendants have any good faith bases to allege most of their defenses. Plaintiffs thus \nbelieve that this motion should narrow the issues actually at issue for trial. For those reasons, Plaintiffs move for judgment on \nthe pleadings pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 438(c), and respectfully request that the Court strike the \nState Defendants’ defective affirmative defenses. \n  \nII. ARGUMENT \nA. The State Defendants’ Answer “Does Not State Facts Sufficient To Constitute A Defense To The Complaint.” \nTo plead an affirmative defense, the State Defendants must allege the ultimate facts, not mere legal conclusions. Their \npleading burden is identical to a plaintiff’s burden to plead the ultimate facts constituting the cause of action. 5 Witkin, Cal. \nProc. (4th ed. 1997), Plead § 1009, p. 463; Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial ¶ 6:459 (2001). \n  \nAs the court explained in S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen, 226 Cal. App. 2d 725, 732 (1964), “the determination whether an \nanswer states a defense is governed by the same principles which are applicable in determining if a complaint states a cause \nof action.” See also FPI Dev., Inc. v. Nakashima, 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 384 (1991) (answer must aver facts “as carefully and \nwith as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint”). \n  \nThe “purpose of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is to test the sufficiency of the pleadings.” Shin v. Kong, 80 Cal. \nApp. 4th 498, 502-03 (2000). Plaintiffs are entitled to test the sufficiency of the State Defendants’ affirmative defenses to \ndetermine which ones have a legitimate basis and will be actual defenses contested at trial. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim \nW., 160 Cal. App. 3d 326, 333 (1984) (affirming judgment on the pleadings for plaintiff where defendant’s “answer failed to \n... set up affirmative matter constituting a defense”). \n  \nThe State Defendants’ First through Fourteenth Affirmative Defenses fail to “state[] facts sufficient to constitute a defense” \nto any of the nine claims asserted against them in the Fifth Amended Complaint,1 and thus are subject to a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n1. Purported First Affirmative Defense - Failure to State a Cause of Action \nThe purported First Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that the “Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action against State Defendants.” State Defendants’ Answer To Fifth Amended Petition For Writ of \nMandate, filed April 8, 2005 (“Ans.”), at 15. This affirmative defense alleges no facts. Furthermore, it does not indicate what \nelements - if any - are missing from any of the causes of action alleged in the Fifth Amended Complaint. It is worth noting \nthat this Court, in its January 6, 2005 Order, already rejected this defense as it applies to Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action for \nviolation of the Lanterman Act and Seventh Cause of Action for violation of the Medicaid Act. If there were any legal defects \nwith respect to any of Plaintiffs’ other causes of action, the State Defendants could have (and would have) challenged them \n3 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs/Petitioners, v...., 2005 WL 4976054...   \n \n \nduring the more than three years since Plaintiffs brought this action. \n  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § \n438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n2. Purported Second Affirmative Defense -Waiver, Estoppel and/or Laches \nThe purported Second Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that “[P]laintiffs have waived, relinquished, and/or \nabandoned, and are equitably estopped to assert any claim for relief against State Defendants regarding the allegations \ncontained in the Complaint.” Ans. at 15. \n  \nThe equitable defense of waiver requires the “intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.” See \nHarper v. Kaiser Cement Corp., 144 Cal. App. 3d 616, 619 (1983) (citations omitted). The State Defendants have failed to \nplead any facts demonstrating that Plaintiffs intentionally relinquished any known right. As a result, the State Defendants \nhave failed to plead the requisite elements of the defense of waiver, and have failed to inform Plaintiffs what they supposedly \ndid that could constitute such a waiver. \n  \n“The elements of the doctrine” of estoppel are “that (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must \nintend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it was so \nintended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.” \nCounty of Los Angeles v. City of Alhambra, 27 Cal. 3d 184, 196 (1980) (citing City of Long Beach v. Mansell, 3 Cal. 3d 462, \n488-89 (1970)). The State Defendants plead no facts which show that they relied on any representations or conduct of the \nPlaintiffs or that any such reliance was either reasonable or detrimental. \n  \nThe equitable defense of laches may bar relief for those parties that “neglect their rights” to the “disadvantage or prejudice of \nother parties.” 11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987), Equity, §§ 14-15, pp. 690-92. The State Defendants have \nalleged no facts showing any “neglect” of any kind on Plaintiffs’ part, nor do they allege any facts establishing that State \nDefendants were disadvantaged or prejudiced by any conduct by Plaintiffs. \n  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § \n438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n3. Purported Third Affirmative Defense - Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel \nThe purported Third Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that “[P]laintiffs’ claims, in whole or in part, are barred \nby the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.” Ans. at 15. \n  \nThe prerequisite elements for the defense of res judicata are: (1) a claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a \nclaim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding; (2) the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the \nparty against whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding. Brinton v. \nBankers Pension Servs., Inc., 76 Cal. App. 4th 550, 556 (1999). To raise the defense of res judicata, the defendant must \nspecifically identify the prior final judgment which bars the present action. 5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (4th ed. 1997), Plead § 1055, \np. 505. “When a judgment or order of a court is conclusive, the judgment or order must be alleged in the pleadings if there be \nan opportunity to do so.” Civ. Proc. Code § 1908.5. The State Defendants’ Answer does not allege facts which would tend to \nestablish any of the elements of res judicata. Although it lists by title the Sanchez v. Johnson case, it does not identify any \nclaims or issues that were adjudicated to a final judgment that would bar this lawsuit, nor does it allege the parties to that \naction. \n  \nThe defense of collateral estoppel requires that: (1) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party in the \nprior proceeding; (2) the issue decided at the previous proceeding is identical to that which is sought to be relitigated; and (2) \nthe previous proceedings resulted in a final judgment on the merits.” People v. Sims, 32 Cal. 3d 468, 484 (1982). The State \nDefendants’ Answer does not allege any facts which would establish any of the elements of collateral estoppel. \n  \n4 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs/Petitioners, v...., 2005 WL 4976054...   \n \n \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § \n438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n4. Purported Fourth Affirmative Defense - Uncertainty \nThe purported Fourth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended \nComplaint “are uncertain,” and cites to several paragraphs in the Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended Complaint. Ans. at 15. The State \nDefendants do not articulate what it is about Plaintiffs’ allegations that is uncertain. Thus, the State Defendants have not \nsatisfied their burden to allege this defense “as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of \naction and are alleged in the complaint.” Nakashima, 231 Cal. App. 3d 384. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for \njudgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n5. Purported Fifth Affirmative Defense - Claims Are Subject To Other Actions Already Pending \nThe purported Fifth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred “because such claims \nare subject to other actions litigated in other courts, e.g. writ proceedings in individual cases and Richard S.” Ans. at 15. \nState Defendants’ allegations do not contain a proper allegation that the actions are pending, rather it alleges that they were \n“litigated.” \n  \nThe defense that other actions are pending is a plea in abatement that must be “specific and factual.” 5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. \n(4th ed. 1997), Plead § 1074, p. 522. “It should identify the former action and state when it was brought, what the cause of \naction was, what relief was demanded, and the facts of its pendency.” Id. (citing Fresno Planing Mill Co. v Manning, 20 Cal. \nApp. 766, 768 (1912). Since pleas in abatement are generally disfavored, “[s]etting up the plea in general terms is \nineffective.” Id.; see, e.g., California Trust Co. v. Gustason, 15 Cal. 2d 268, 273 (1940) (granting demurrer to defense \nbecause answer “does not state when the other action was brought, what the cause of action was, nor what relief was \ndemanded.”). The State Defendants have not met their strict burden of specifically pleading this defense. The State \nDefendants have not identified any pending action, when such action was brought, what causes of action purportedly overlap \nwith the present action, what relief was demanded, nor any specific facts of the pendency of any other action. \n  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § \n438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n6. Purported Sixth Affirmative Defense - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies \nThe purported Sixth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred because “Plaintiffs’ \nclaims, and those of the putative class,... have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.” Ans. at 15. \n  \nThe defense of exhaustion of administrative remedies relies upon the rule that where an administrative remedy is provided by \nstatute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act. Campbell v. \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 35 Cal. 4th 311, 321-322 (2005). There are “numerous exceptions to the rule including \nsituations where the agency indulges in unreasonable delay, when the subject matter lies outside the administrative agency’s \njurisdiction, when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm, when the agency is incapable of \ngranting an adequate remedy, and when resort to the administrative process would be futile because it is clear what the \nagency’s decision would be.” Green v. City of Oceanside, 194 Cal. App. 3d 212, 222 (1987). \n  \nThe State Defendants allege no facts which would raise even an inference that the defense of exhaustion of administrative \nremedies would bar Plaintiffs’ claims. The State Defendants do not allege which, if any, statutes require exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies, nor for which of Plaintiffs’ nine causes of action those purported administrative remedies apply. \nMoreover, the State Defendants do not allege any specific facts tending to show that Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust any or \nall administrative remedies. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be \ngranted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n5 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs/Petitioners, v...., 2005 WL 4976054...   \n \n \n  \n7. Purported Seventh Affirmative Defense - No Equitable Relief \nThe purported Seventh Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that equitable relief is barred “because plaintiffs are \nnot entitled to any relief, but even if they were entitled to relief, plaintiffs have an adequate remedy of law and cannot \notherwise establish the elements necessary to obtain equitable relief.” Ans. at 15. \n  \n“The rule in this state is that injunctive ... relief will not be granted where there is a plain, complete, speedy, and adequate \nremedy at law.” Flying Dutchman Park, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 93 Cal. App. 4th 1129, 1138 (2001). \nNoticeably absent from the State Defendants’ Seventh Affirmative Defense is any factual allegation setting forth what other \nremedy at law Plaintiffs may have, and how that remedy would be complete and adequate to address Plaintiffs’ claims. Thus, \nthe State Defendants have fallen well short of alleging this defense “as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which \nconstitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint.” Nakashima, 231 Cal. App. 3d at 384. For these reasons, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n8. Purported Eighth Affirmative Defense - Statute of Limitations \nThe purported Eighth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that each of Plaintiffs’ claims “is barred by the \napplicable statute of limitations.” Ans. at 15. \n  \nIn pleading the defense of statute of limitations, the defendant must specifically cite the statutory code section which bars the \ncause of action. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 458. Failure to specially plead the statute of limitations defense results in a waiver of \nthe defense. 5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (4th ed. 1997), Plead §§ 1043-1047, pp. 491-498. The State Defendants do not cite any \nspecific statutes of limitations, nor do they identify the causes of action to which their Eighth Affirmative Defense applies. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § \n438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n9. Purported Ninth Affirmative Defense - Fundamental Alteration \nThe purported Ninth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that the relief sought by Plaintiffs “is barred because it \nwould require defendants to fundamentally alter substantial portions of California’s services and programs ... result[ing] in an \nallocation of available resources that is inequitable.” Ans. at 15-16. \n  \nThe defense of fundamental alteration applies to claims arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). See \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 605-606 (1999). “Factors that are relevant to the fundamental alteration defense ... include \nbut [are] not limited to the state’s ability to continue meeting the needs of other institutionalized [persons] for whom \ncommunity placement is not appropriate, whether the state has a waiting list for community placement, and whether the state \nhas developed a comprehensive plan to move eligible patients into community care settings.” Id. In asserting that the relief \nsought by Plaintiffs is barred by the fundamental alteration defense, the State Defendants ignore the fact that aside from their \nADA cause of action, Plaintiffs have eight other causes of action to which the fundamental alteration defense is inapplicable. \nMoreover, the State Defendants have not alleged any facts tending to show that the fundamental alteration defense would \napply to Plaintiffs’ ADA claim. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should \nbe granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n10. Purported Tenth Affirmative Defense - Conduct of Other Persons \nThe purported Tenth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that “to the extent the Complaint alleges violations of \nlaw, those alleged violations are the result of conduct or omissions of persons other than the State Defendants.” Ans. at 16. \n  \nThis is not a recognized affirmative defense, but rather a denial of specific factual allegations made in Plaintiffs’ Fifth \n6 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs/Petitioners, v...., 2005 WL 4976054...   \n \n \nAmended Complaint. Moreover, the State Defendants do not allege any specific facts tending to show that the violations of \nlaw alleged in Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended Complaint were the result of the conduct of other persons. For these reasons, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n11. Purported Eleventh Affirmative Defense - No Ministerial Duties \nThe purported Eleventh Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that plaintiffs’ “writ of mandate under the \nLanterman Act and the Medicaid Act is barred because the actions plaintiffs seek to compel are not ministerial.” Ans. at 16. \nThis is not a recognized affirmative defense. In any event, this Court and the Court of Appeal have already held that \nmandamus will lie even where the duty sought to be enforced is not purely ministerial. E.g., January 6, 2005 Order. \nMoreover, the State Defendants do not specify which actions, if any, are not ministerial. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n12. Purported Twelfth Affirmative Defense - Relief Inconsistent With State Plan \nThe purported Twelfth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that “the relief requested is barred, in whole or in \npart, because it is inconsistent with the federally mandated and approved Medicaid state plan.” Ans. at 16. This is not a \nrecognized affirmative defense, but rather a denial of specific factual allegations made in Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended \nComplaint. Moreover, the State Defendants do not allege any specific facts tending to show that the relief sought by Plaintiffs \nis inconsistent with any federally mandated and approved Medicaid state plan. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for \njudgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n13. Purported Thirteenth Affirmative Defense - No Entitlement \nThe purported Thirteenth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred “because to the \nextent that the Complaint alleges entitlement to services or programs which are not being provided, some or all plaintiffs or \ntheir representatives have themselves failed to demonstrate entitlement to such programs or services.” Ans. at 16. This is not \na recognized affirmative defense, but rather a denial of specific factual allegations made in Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended \nComplaint. Moreover, the State Defendants do not allege any specific facts tending to negate Plaintiffs’ allegations that they \nare entitled to certain programs and services. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this \ndefense should be granted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \n14. Purported Fourteenth Affirmative Defense - All Placements Appropriate \nThe purported Fourteenth Affirmative Defense alleges in conclusory terms that Plaintiffs claims are barred “because at all \nrelevant times, placements of plaintiffs and the putative class members were based upon professional judgment and/or were \nappropriate under prevailing practice.” Ans. at 16. This is not a recognized affirmative defense, but rather a denial of specific \nfactual allegations made in Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amended Complaint. Moreover, the State Defendants do not allege any facts \ntending to negate Plaintiffs’ specific allegations concerning the inappropriate placement of the representative plaintiffs and \nputative class members. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to this defense should be \ngranted. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code § 438(c)(1)(A). \n  \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the \npleadings and strike the State Defendants’ defective affirmative defenses. \n  \n7 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Plaintiffs/Petitioners, v...., 2005 WL 4976054...   \n \n \nFootnotes \n \n1  Moreover, State Defendants fail to indicate to which of the nine causes of action - if any - each defense supposedly applies. This \n  alone is a reason to grant the motion. \n \n \n   \n \n \n8 \n ",

Ct. No. 2002-038715) \nCOUNCILS FOR THE RETARDED et   \nal., \n           Interveners and Respondents. \n \n  Nearly 15 years after passage of the landmark Lanterman Developmental \nDisabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act),1 a group of persons with developmental \ndisabilities sued the Department of Developmental Services (Department) and other \ndefendants to secure their entitlement to community living arrangements under the \nLanterman Act.  (Coffelt v. Department of Developmental Services (Super. Ct. S.F. \nCity and County, 1994, No. 916401) (Coffelt).)  In 1994, Coffelt was resolved with a \nstipulated class action settlement.  \n                                            \n1  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4500 et seq.  All further statutory \nreferences are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated. \n  1\n\n \n  The current lawsuit2 is the second major suit prosecuted to enforce the right of \npersons with developmental disabilities to live in the least restrictive environment \ncommensurate with their needs, thereby avoiding unnecessary institutionalization.  \nThe focus is on the systemic failure of the state agencies and regional centers to \nprovide proper oversight and enforce constitutional, statutory and regulatory mandates \nto place individuals in less restrictive community settings when appropriate.  Only \ninjunctive and declaratory relief is sought.  Cognizant that individualized outcomes \nwere not being sought, the trial court nonetheless concluded that proof would focus on \nthe individual circumstances of class members.  Denying class certification, the court \ndetermined that appellants demonstrated ascertainability, numerosity, typicality and \nadequacy of counsel but failed to establish commonality, adequacy of class \nrepresentation and superiority.  As we explain, the court based its decision on \nimproper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions.  Accordingly, we reverse the \njudgment. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Overview of Legal Framework \n  Enacted in 1977, the Lanterman Act establishes a comprehensive scheme for \nproviding services to people with developmental disabilities.3  The stated policy of the \n                                            \n2  Plaintiffs and appellants are 16 representative plaintiffs, two taxpayer plaintiffs \nand three organizational plaintiffs.  State defendants and respondents are the Department \nand its director, sued in his official capacity; the Health and Human Services Agency and \nits secretary, sued in her official capacity; the Department of Health Services and its \ndirector, sued in her official capacity; the Department of Finance and its acting director, \nsued in his official capacity; and the Department of Mental Health.  Regional Center \ndefendants and respondents are the 21 regional centers in this state.  \n3  The term “developmental disability” refers to “a disability that originates before \nan individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, \nand constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. . . .  [T]his term shall include \nmental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.  This term shall also include \ndisabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require \ntreatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not \n  2\n\n \nlegislation is to establish “[a]n array of services and supports . . . which is sufficiently \ncomplete to meet the needs and choices of each person with developmental \ndisabilities, regardless of age or degree of disability, and at each stage of life and to \nsupport their integration into the mainstream life of the community.  To the maximum \nextent feasible, services and supports should be available throughout the state to \nprevent the dislocation of persons with developmental disabilities from their home \ncommunities.  [¶] Services and supports should be available to enable persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities to approximate the pattern of everyday living available to \npeople without disabilities of the same age.”  (§ 4501.) \n  The Lanterman Act enumerates legal rights of persons with developmental \ndisabilities.  (§ 4502.)  These include the “right to treatment and habilitation services \nand supports in the least restrictive environment” and the “right to dignity, privacy, \nand humane care,” with treatment, services and supports provided in natural \ncommunity settings to the maximum extent possible.  (§ 4502, subds. (a) & (b).)  As \nour Supreme Court stated in Association for Retarded Citizens v. Department of \nDevelopmental Services (1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 391:  “[T]he Act defines a basic right \nand a corresponding basic obligation:  the right which it grants to the developmentally \ndisabled person is to be provided with services that enable him to live a more \nindependent and productive life in the community; the obligation which it imposes on \nthe state is to provide such services.” \n                                                                                                                                            \ninclude other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.”  (§ 4512, \nsubd. (a).) \n  Nearly one-third of the developmentally disabled persons served in California have \na diagnosis of two or more disabilities and approximately 10 percent are dually diagnosed \nwith both a developmental disability and a mental health condition.  \n  3\n\n \n  A network of 21 regional centers4 is responsible for determining eligibility, \nassessing needs and coordinating and delivering direct services to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their families within a defined geographical area.  \n(§ 4620 et seq.)  Designed on a service coordination model, the purpose of the regional \ncenters is to “assist persons with developmental disabilities and their families in \nsecuring those services and supports which maximize opportunities and choices for \nliving, working, learning, and recreating in the community.”  (§ 4640.7, subd. (a).)  \nThe Department allocates funds to the centers for operations and the purchasing of \nservices, including funding to purchase community-based services and supports.  \n(§§ 4620, 4621, 4787.) \n  The Department is the designated state agency with “jurisdiction over the \nexecution of the laws relating to the care, custody, and treatment of developmentally \ndisabled persons . . . .”  (§ 4416.)  Accordingly, it is charged with (1) monitoring the \nregional centers to ensure that they comply with federal and state law, and (2) taking \naction to support the centers in achieving compliance and in providing “high quality \nservices and supports to consumers[5] and their families.”  (§§ 4434, subds. (a) & (b), \n4500.5, subd. (d), 4501.) \n  The specific rights of persons with developmental disabilities and the \ncorresponding obligations of the state are determined through an individual program \nplan (IPP) procedure that meets common statutory requirements.  (§§ 4646-4648.)  \nThe IPP is developed by a planning team that includes the consumer, his or her legally \nauthorized representative, and one or more regional center representatives.  (§ 4512, \nsubd. (j).)  The goals and objectives developed through the IPP process should \n                                            \n4  The Department contracts with private nonprofit corporations to establish and \noperate regional centers.  The nonprofit corporations must meet governing board criteria \nthat ensure a diverse and representative membership knowledgeable of, or interested in, \ndevelopmental disabilities.  (§§ 4621, 4622.) \n5  “Consumer” is defined as “a person who has a disability that meets the definition \nof developmental disability . . . .”  (§ 4512, subd. (d).) \n  4\n\n \nmaximize opportunities for the individual to be part of community life; enjoy \nincreased control over his or her life; acquire positive roles in community life; and \ndevelop the skills to accomplish the same.  (§ 4646.5, subd. (a)(2).)  In securing \nservices to implement the IPP, the highest preference is afforded services and supports \nthat allow minors to live with their families and adults to live as independently as \npossible in the community.  (§ 4648, subd. (a)(1)-(2).) \n  The Department directly operates seven public institutions (developmental \ncenters) which house approximately 3,000 of the state’s more than 200,000 persons \nwith developmental disabilities.  (See §§ 4440, 4440.5.)  Approximately 4,600 persons \nlive in other institutions.   \nB.  Community Placement Plan \n  The Lanterman Act includes provisions to create and implement a community \nplacement plan (CPP) process designed to move individuals with developmental \ndisabilities from the developmental centers to the community.  (§ 4418.25.)  The \nDepartment is responsible for establishing policies and procedures for development of \nannual CPP’s by each regional center and allocates funds for implementation.  \n(§ 4418.25, subds. (a) & (d).)  Under the CPP mandate the regional centers must \nidentify consumers for possible transition to community living arrangements, \ncoordinate with the developmental centers and other entities on an IPP process to \nensure a successful transition, and develop a supporting budget to accomplish the goal.  \n(§§ 4418.25, 4418.3.)  The CPP provides for dedicated funding for regional centers to \nmove selected persons from developmental centers to the community, and to prevent \ndevelopmental center placement in the first instance.  (§ 4418.25, subds. (b) & (d).) \nC.  Agnews Closure Plan \n  In 2005, the Department submitted a plan to the Legislature calling for the \nclosure of Agnews Developmental Center (Agnews) by June 30, 2007.  The Bay Area \nregional centers collaborated in this effort by engaging in the individualized planning \nand resource development and other activities authorized in their CPP pursuant to \nsection 4418.25.  The Agnews closure plan proposes “an enhanced community service \n  5\n\n \ndelivery system in the Bay Area that can meet the needs of the majority of Agnews’ \nresidents.”  To that end the plan provides for development of new resources and \ninnovative programs, including a sustainable increase in appropriate housing.   \nD.  Coffelt \n  In 1991, the Coffelt class action was brought against the Department and others \nchallenging the state’s implementation of the Lanterman Act on many fronts.  The \nparties stipulated to a class action settlement in 1994.  The settlement included \ncertification of a settlement class comprised of developmental center residents \nrecommended for community placement, and required systemic reforms as well as a \nnet reduction in 2,000 persons in the developmental center population over a five-year \nperiod.  \n  During the settlement period, the developmental center population declined by \nmore than the targeted amount, but thereafter movement of individuals from these \ninstitutions to the community settings slowed considerably.  In the words of a \nDepartment employee:  “[A]fter the Coffelt settlement agreement was over, the \npressure was off. . . .”  \nE.  The Present Litigation \n  Appellants filed suit in January 2002.  The fifth amended complaint is the \noperative pleading, filed in July 2005.  The proposed class is defined as follows:  “All \nCalifornia residents with a developmental disability, as defined in . . . section 4512(b), \nwho are (or become) institutionalized,[6] and those who are at risk[7] of being \n                                            \n6  Under this definition, the term “institutions” refers to public, licensed or certified \nfacilities, including developmental centers, as well as an array of other public and private \nfacilities with a capacity of 16 or more persons.  \n7  A person is “at risk” of being institutionalized when “the regional center \ndetermines, or is informed by the consumer’s parents, legal guardian, conservator, or \nauthorized representative that the community placement of [the] consumer is at risk of \nfailing, and that admittance to a state developmental center is a likelihood.”  (§ 4418.7, \nsubd. (a).)  As well, for purposes of the class definition, persons at risk of \ninstitutionalization also include those meeting the same criteria with respect to \n  6\n\n \ninstitutionalized, in congregate residential facilities having a capacity of 16 or more \nindividuals.”  \n  The preamble to the fifth amended complaint sets forth the nature of the \ncontroversy permeating the nine causes of action:8  “Thousands of Californians with \ndevelopmental disabilities are needlessly isolated and segregated from mainstream \nsociety in large congregate public and private institutions.  Every year hundreds more \nfind themselves at risk of institutionalization due to the lack of appropriate community \nsupports and crisis intervention.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to restore their legal \nrights to freedom from such institutionalization and to live, with appropriate supports, \nin our neighborhoods. [¶] The current circumstances violate [f]ederal and [s]tate law.  \nIn the [Lanterman Act] . . . California created an entitlement for people with \ndevelopmental disabilities to an array of services and supports sufficiently complete to \nmeet their needs and choices, to support their integration into the mainstream life of \nthe community and to enable them to approximate the pattern of everyday living \navailable to people without disabilities. . . .  Despite this mandate, thousands of people \nwith developmental disabilities are unnecessarily institutionalized because the [s]tate \nand the regional centers have failed in their obligation under the Lanterman Act to \ndevelop and provide community-based alternatives.”  \n                                                                                                                                            \nnondevelopmental center institutions.  Finally, the class definition encompasses \nindividuals who are released from a developmental center for provisional placement for \none year, as these individuals have an “automatic right of return” to the developmental \ncenter during that period.  (§ 4508.)  \n8  The causes of action are:  (1) violation of Lanterman Act entitlement to \nnoninstitutional community living arrangements based on individual need; (2) deprivation \nof rights under state nondiscrimination laws (Gov. Code, § 11135; Welf. & Inst. Code, \n§ 4502); (3) deprivation of rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) \n(42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.); (4) violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.); (5) violation of state constitutional rights; (6) violation of federal \nconstitutional rights; (7) violation of the Medicaid Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.); \n(8) unlawful and unfair business practices against regional center defendants; and \n(9) illegal expenditure of taxpayer money.  \n  7\n\n \n  The preamble goes on to introduce the ADA and the holdings in Olmstead v. \nL.C. (1999) 527 U.S. 581, 600, that (1) “unjustified institutional isolation of persons \nwith disabilities is a form of discrimination”; and (2) states are required to provide \ncommunity based treatment when, among other factors, the placement can be \nreasonably accommodated (id. at p. 607).  Continuing, the preamble states:  “[I]n \nviolation of the ADA, California has failed to take adequate steps to reduce the \nunnecessary institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities at a \nreasonable pace. [¶] Unnecessary segregation also contravenes other [s]tate and \n[f]ederal statutory rights as well as fundamental constitutional rights, including the \nrights to liberty, privacy and freedom of association. [¶] In spite of these rights and \nobligations, state and regional center defendants do not do adequate assessments of \nindividuals’ ability to benefit from community living, do not do adequate program \nplanning, and therefore, do not develop sufficient quality programs to meet the needs \nof people with developmental disabilities.  Because of defendants’ policies and \npractices, and because California continues to under-fund its community service \nsystem, there is a continuing shortage of stable, quality community living \narrangements and ancillary supports that would enable people with developmental \ndisabilities to achieve their potential for independence and integration into the \ncommunity.  The further and inevitable result of defendants’ conduct is the continued \nunnecessary institutionalization of thousands of people with developmental \ndisabilities.”  \n  Appellants requested declaratory and injunctive relief as well as orders pursuant \nto a writ of mandate compelling defendants to comply with enumerated duties.  \nF.  Appellants’ Evidence and Claims \n  According to appellants’ evidence, respondents have acknowledged that the \nvast majority of class members could live in less restrictive settings with appropriate \nsupports and services.  One Department official indicated “it is possible to serve the \nmajority of people in the community if the appropriate resources are there and if the \ncapacity of the community exists as a general principle.”  When queried about the \n  8\n\n \npercentage of people in developmental centers who could live in the community with \nappropriate supports and services, another Department official responded \n“100 percent” and agreed that people with the most significant support challenges can \nbe served in noninstitutional settings.  One regional center director stated his belief \nthat “everyone who is in the developmental center can be served in a community \nsetting.”  Another testified that “all of the approximately 125 people that reside at the \ndevelopmental center from the [catchment] area are capable of living in the \ncommunity successfully.”  \n  Appellants point to the Agnews closure plan as a model demonstrating the \nfeasibility of moving a substantial majority of developmental center residents to less \nrestrictive, community placements.  The populations served by other developmental \ncenters are similar, yet no plans are afoot to close or otherwise transition large portions \nof the residents of those institutions to community settings.  Thus, according to \nappellants, except for the Agnews closure plan, the CPP’s, as implemented by regional \ncenters and the Department, are “woefully inadequate” in meeting the least restrictive \nenvironment mandate of the Lanterman Act and other laws.  \n  And, although the Department is responsible for establishing policies and \nprocedures for the annual CPP’s developed by the regional centers, it has not \ndeveloped “a priori standards as such” for determining whether CPP placement goals \nare adequate.  The Department has never directed a regional center to raise its \nplacement goal, but it has requested that a center lower its goal.  \n  The Department has developed an incentive system whereby operational dollars \nwill be withheld proportionally from a regional center if it does not meet its placement \ngoals.  In fact, this system can work as an incentive for regional centers to seek fewer \nplacements than possible in order to avoid penalties for trying harder.  At least one \nregional center penalized under this system subsequently reduced the number of \nplacements in its CPP by half to avoid a future penalty.  The CPP manager for that \ncenter called the allocation system “very troubling.”  \n  9\n\n \n  Lyn Rucker, with decades of national as well as international experience \nworking with government agencies and the courts to develop and implement systems \nthat promote community services for individuals with developmental disabilities, \ndeclared that under the CPP process “except for residents of [Agnews], the majority of \ndevelopmental center residents will have to wait for decades for an opportunity to live \nin the community at the pace currently being achieved in California.”  As an example, \nSonoma Developmental Center is the largest developmental center with a population \nof 754 as of August 31, 2005.  This institution averages 20 community placements a \nyear.  Nonetheless, Sonoma Developmental Center serves a population of persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities that are no more severe than those in Agnews, where 85 \npercent of residents will move to the community under the closure plan.  \n  In addition to residents of developmental centers, another 4,462 persons live in \nother congregate institutions.  Although the CPP applies only to those residing in \ndevelopmental centers or who are at risk of developmental center placement, the CPP \n“is not intended to limit the department’s or regional centers’ responsibility to \notherwise conduct assessments and individualized program planning, and to provide \nneeded services and supports in the least restrictive, most integrated setting in accord \nwith the [Lanterman Act].”  (§ 4418.25, subd. (b).)  Nevertheless, there is no policy or \nplanning process comparable to the CPP process for reducing the number of \nconsumers living in large, nondevelopmental center congregate institutions.  \nMoreover, the Department does not require regional centers to have a plan for \ndeflecting people for admission to these facilities.  \nG.  Motions to Intervene and for Class Certification \n  Early in the litigation, 10 developmental center residents who wished to remain \nin institutions and two organizations representing parents, conservators and friends of \ndevelopmental center residents moved to intervene.9  Interveners argued that the \n                                            \n9  The organizations are California Association of State Hospital/Parent Councils \nfor the Retarded (CASH/PCR) and California Association for the Retarded (CAR).  \n  10\n\n \ninterests of plaintiffs were hostile to their interests, plaintiffs were not adequate \nrepresentatives, and the relief they sought would impair the rights of those persons \nwhose needs are best met in a developmental center.  Granting leave to intervene, the \ncourt limited the complaint in intervention to ensuring “that the legal rights of parents \nand guardians to participate in the planning process and the ability of professionals to \nrecommend placement in development centers are not adversely affected by any \njudgment in this action.”   \n  Appellants filed the motion for class certification that is the subject of this \nappeal in September 2005.  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that \n(1) appellants could not satisfy the element of commonality because the issues dictated \na concentration on the individualized circumstances of class members; (2) appellants \nhad not demonstrated that they would adequately represent the interests of all putative \nclass members or that the interests of interveners would be protected adequately by \ntheir presence in the litigation; and (3) the wrongs asserted could not readily be cured \non a classwide basis, but the hearing procedure under section 4700 et seq. would be \neffective for redress of individual grievances.  This appeal followed. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Certification Requirements; Standard of Review \n  Code of Civil Procedure section 382 permits class actions “when the question is \none of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are \nnumerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court . . . .”  The \ncertification question does not inquire whether the action is factually or legally \nmeritorious.  Rather, the proponent of certification must establish the existence of a \nwell-defined community of interest among class members.  (Lockheed Martin Corp. v. \nSuperior Court (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, 1104.)  The community of interest \n                                                                                                                                            \nCASH/PCR claims that of the approximately 3,120 residents in the developmental centers, \nnearly half have a family member, friend or conservator who is affiliated with the \norganization.  \n  11\n\n \nrequirement embraces three factors:  (1) common questions of law or fact that \npredominate over questions affecting individual members; (2) class representatives \nwith claims or defenses that are typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who \ncan adequately represent the class.  (Ibid.) \n  As well, in assessing the appropriateness of certification trial courts are charged \nwith carefully weighing the respective benefits and burdens of class litigation to the \nend that maintenance of the class action will only be permitted where substantial \nbenefits accrue to the litigants and the court.  (Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) \n23 Cal.4th 429, 435.)  This obligation entails considering the role of the class action \nmechanism in deterring and redressing wrongdoing.  (Id. at pp. 445- 446.)  Further, the \nsubstantial benefits analysis raises the question whether a class action is superior to \nindividual lawsuits and other alternative procedures for resolving the controversy.  \n(Basurco v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 110, 120-121; Caro v. \nProctor & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 660-661. \n  Trial courts have wide discretion with regard to class certification.  Thus we \nwill not overturn the lower court’s certification decision which is supported by \nsubstantial evidence unless it (1) used improper criteria; or (2) made erroneous legal \nassumptions.  (Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470; Reese v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1229, 1233.)  We do not decide in \nthe first instance whether the requested class is appropriate.  Rather, our job is to \ndecide whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying certification.  (Reese, \nsupra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1233.)  A certification ruling not supported by substantial \nevidence will not stand.  (Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 29 Cal.4th \nat p. 1106.)  By the same token, even if the decision denying certification is supported \nby substantial evidence, we will reverse if it is based on improper criteria or incorrect \nassumptions.  (Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 436.) \n  12\n\n \nB.  Commonality \n  1.  Introduction \n  It is the burden of the proponent of class certification to show, with substantial \nevidence, that common questions of law or fact predominate over questions affecting \nindividual members.  (Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 29 Cal.4th at \npp. 1104, 1106.)  And whether such substantial evidence exists involves analysis of \nwhether the proponent’s “theory of recovery”  is likely to prove compatible with class \ntreatment.  (Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 327 \n(Sav-On).) \n  The trial court delivered a ruling on the issue of commonality that was marked \nby contradictions and inconsistencies.  While acknowledging that appellants were \nseeking only systemic relief, and not individual solutions to individual problems, it \nnonetheless insisted on defining the claims asserted in the litigation with respect to the \n“common discrete wrongs[10] that affect individual class members.”  Thus, instead of \nfocusing on the similar but broader list of common legal and factual questions which \nappellants provided, and the proof offered for the same, the court seized instead on \nappellants’ examples of typicality to define discrete wrongs common to each \nindividual which it concluded demanded individualized inquiries. \n  Compounding this error, the trial court filtered the analysis and considerations \nrequired to address these issues solely through the lens of the individual and his or her \nIPP, rather than taking a broader, systemic view concentrating on respondents’ \npolicies and practices.  Upon undertaking its examination of discrete wrongs, the court \nconcluded that common issues of fact would not predominate because the deficiencies, \n                                            \n10  These wrongs, as set out by the court, were (1) failure to provide understandable \ninformation in the IPP process; (2) failure to provide adequate assessments in the IPP \nprocess; (3) basing IPP recommendations on factors unrelated to the needs and choices of \nthe individuals concerned; (4) failure to provide timely services and supports; and \n(5) failure to provide adequate community resources.  \n  13\n\n \nvariables and pertinent lines of inquiry would be individualized.  Respondents cling to \nthis single-minded approach on appeal.  \n  Additionally, in choosing to focus on discrete wrongs, the court relied \nsubstantially on J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez (10th Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d 1280, 128911 \n                                            \n11  There, plaintiffs pursued a theory of systemic failure in their effort to structurally \nreform New Mexico’s system for evaluating and treating children with developmental and \nmental disabilities who were in the state’s custody.  Parting ways with the Third Circuit’s \ndecision in a similar case (Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey (3rd Cir. 1994) 43 F.3d 48 \n(Baby Neal)), the court upheld the refusal to certify a class because there was no single \nconstitutional or statutory claim common to the named plaintiffs and putative class \nmembers.  (J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, supra, 186 F.3d at pp. 1288-1289.) \n  Baby Neal was a federal class action in which the named plaintiffs sought \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against officials responsible for operating Philadelphia’s \nchild welfare system. Numerous federal and state statutory and constitutional violations \nwere alleged. The district court denied class certification under rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure (hereafter rule 23(b)(2)) because each plaintiff was faced with his \nor her individual circumstances and needs and thus the class could not complain about a \nsingle common injury (Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 54).  (Rule 23(b)(2) is a route to \ncertification where “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”)  Reversing, the \ncircuit court explained that the differences in the factual background of each claim are \nunlikely to affect the outcome of the legal issue, especially “where plaintiffs request \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against a defendant engaging in a common course of \nconduct toward them, and there is therefore no need for individualized determinations of \nthe propriety of injunctive relief.  [Citation.]  Indeed, [rule 23](b)(2) classes have been \ncertified in a legion of civil rights cases where commonality findings were based primarily \non the fact that defendant’s conduct is central to the claims of all class members \nirrespective of their individual circumstances and the disparate effects of the conduct.”  \n(Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 57.)  With respect to the matter at hand, the court ruled:  \n“Plaintiffs have alleged that systemic failure causes the DHS to violate various mandates \nunder federal statutory and constitutional provisions.  Because the children in the system \nare comparably subject to the injuries caused by this systemic failure, even if the extent of \ntheir individual injuries may be affected by their individual circumstances, the challenge to \nthe system constituted a legal claim applicable to the class as a whole.  An order forcing \nthe DHS to comply with their statutory and constitutional mandates would constitute relief \ngenerally applicable to the entire putative class.”  (Id. at p. 64.) \n  14\n\n \nwith its refusal “to read an allegation of systemic failures as a moniker for meeting the \nclass action requirements. . . .  For a common question of law to exist, the putative \nclass must share a discrete legal question of some kind.”  Nevertheless, the court also \nacknowledged that under California law, courts can take an aggregate approach to \nplaintiffs’ claims.  Specifically, the court itself noted that in Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th \nat page 324, the Supreme Court did not separately analyze various statutory and \ncommon law claims because all claims focused on whether class members were \nmisclassified as exempt from overtime laws.  (See also Mendoza v. County of Tulare \n(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 403, 407, 417 [rejecting defendants’ assertion that plaintiff-\nprisoners’ right to relief based on 10 causes of action alleging numerous state and \nfederal statutory and constitutional violations simply amounted to aggregation of \nindividual claims].) \n  In an effort to accommodate appellants’ theory of the case, the court went on to \nspell out what it called an “alternate approach” for class claims seeking only injunctive \nand declaratory relief and centering on whether appellants demonstrated that \nrespondents “ ‘acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.’  \n[(rule 23(b)(2).]”12  (See fn. 11, ante.)  And, not surprisingly, it concluded that a \n                                                                                                                                            \n  The Ninth Circuit recently relied on Baby Neal in a California prisoners’ rights case \nunder the ADA, Rehabilitation Act and Fourteenth Amendment, concluding that \n“commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy \nthat affects all of the putative class members.  [Citations.]  In such circumstance, \nindividual factual differences among the individual litigants or groups of litigants will not \npreclude a finding of commonality.  [(See Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 56).]  Certainly \nthe differences that exist here do not justify requiring groups of persons with different \ndisabilities, all of whom suffer similar harm from the Board’s failure to accommodate their \ndisabilities, to prosecute separate actions.”  (Armstrong v. Davis (9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d \n849, 868.) \n12  In the absence of relevant state precedent, trial courts are urged to follow the \nprocedures set forth in rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for conducting class \nactions.  (Green v. Obledo (1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 145-146.)  As we have no specific \nstatutory provision detailing procedures for class plaintiffs pursuing only injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief, the trial court appropriately looked to rule 23(b)(2) for guidance. \n  15\n\n \ndifferent result would occur if the spotlight were on respondents’ policies instead of \nthe class members’ claims.  Nonetheless, and puzzlingly, the court rejected an \napproach centered on respondents’ common policies and practices generally \napplicable to all putative class members.  It reasoned that such a focus would require \nthe trier of fact to pay significant attention to how the policies and practices affect \neach class member through the development, content and implementation of \nindividual IPP’s, and thus the use of sampling or statistical proof would be restricted.  \nWe conclude that the trial court ignored or misunderstood the guiding principles of \nCalifornia law on the commonality question and thus based its denial of certification \non improper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions. \n  2.  Sav-On Sets the Standard \n  Sav-On teaches that in resolving whether there is substantial evidence to \nsupport the trial court’s certification order, “we consider whether the theory of \nrecovery advanced by the proponents of certification is, as an analytical matter, likely \nto prove amenable to class treatment.”  (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 327.)  As part \nof this process, we consistently look to the allegations in the complaint and the \ndeclarations of attorneys representing the class.  (Ibid.) \n  Sav-On concerned allegations that the drugstore chain misclassified employees \nas exempt from overtime laws and thus failed to pay overtime compensation owing to \nthe plaintiffs.  Despite the defendant’s argument that determination of any liability for \nunpaid overtime compensation depended on making individual computations, the \nplaintiff produced substantial evidence that the defendant’s policy and practice was \none of deliberate misclassification and that due in part to operational standardization, a \nuniform classification policy based solely on job descriptions resulted in widespread \nde facto miscalculation.  (Save-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 328-329.)  Overturning the \nCourt of Appeal’s denial of class certification, the Supreme Court held that even \nallowing for individual damage determinations, either of the plaintiffs’ theories was \namenable to class treatment.  (Id. at pp. 329-330.)  Thus, while calculation of \nindividual damages might be required down the road, this possibility did not foreclose \n  16\n\n \ntaking common evidence on the misclassification issues.  (Id. at p. 332.)  Moreover, \nthe court emphasized the community of interest requirement for certification does not \nmandate that class members have uniform or identical claims.  (Id. at p. 338.)  \nFurther, in deciding whether the commonality requirement has been satisfied, courts \nmay consider pattern and practice, statistical and sampling evidence, expert testimony \nand other indicators of a given defendant’s classwide practices in order to assess \nwhether that common behavior toward similarly situated plaintiffs renders class \ncertification appropriate.  (Id. at p. 333.) \n  Similarly, in Reyes v. Board of Supervisors (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1263, 1278-\n1279,13 a government benefits case attacking a county’s practice of depriving general \nrelief recipients of benefits, the reviewing court explained that the necessity for class \nmembers to establish eligibility and damages individually did not mean that individual \nfact questions predominated.  It also rejected the defendant’s argument that even if the \ncounty had a common duty, proof of whether it actually administered the program in \nquestion improperly depended on individual factual determinations.  Rather, the \npropriety of the county’s actions could be established by reviewing regulations, \ntestimony of employees, and a sampling of representative cases.  (Ibid.) \n  So, too, a community of interest was found in a prisoners’ right case despite the \ncounty’s assertion that any right to relief depended on facts peculiar to each prisoner’s \ncase, thereby amounting “to a mere aggregation of individual claims.”  (Mendoza v. \nCounty of Tulare, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at p. 417.)  Instead, to establish a right to a \nremedy, the plaintiffs could focus on the defendants’ actions and omissions.  If the \ntrial court ultimately found statutory and/or constitutional violations, declaratory and \ninjunctive relief would redress systemic violations common to the class \nnotwithstanding that some would apply only to individuals.  (Id. at p. 418.) \n                                            \n13  Reyes was cited with approval and relied on in Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at \npages 333, footnote 6, and 334. \n  17\n\n \n  3.  Appellants Met the Standard \n  Here, as in the above cases, appellants’ theory of recovery, as gleaned from the \npleadings and declarations, focuses on the common practices, policies, acts and \nomissions of the state actors and regional centers.  The overarching theme is that there \nis a pattern and practice of failure to meet constitutional, statutory and regulatory \nmandates to provide services and place class members in less restrictive settings, and \nthe systemic effect of this failure is to impinge plaintiffs’ rights under state and federal \nlaw.  As stated without ambiguity in their memorandum supporting class certification:  \n“[P]laintiffs are not asking for individual relief for the thousands of members of the \nclass—each of whom, obviously, does have unique needs.  Rather, plaintiffs seek to \ncompel those state and local entities responsible for providing, as an ‘entitlement,’ a \n‘ “ pattern of facilities and services . . . sufficiently complete to meet the needs of each \nperson with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or degree of handicap, and at \neach stage of life” [citation]’ to put in place the procedures, practices and \ninfrastructure that will ensure that they carry out these obligations to class members.  \nThe systemic relief plaintiffs seek could not be obtained on a case-by-case basis.”  \n  In this same memorandum, appellants also detailed the legal and factual issues \ncommon to the class.  Common legal issues were threefold:  (1) Whether respondents’ \npolicies and procedures violate the rights of class members under various enumerated \nstate and federal statutes to avoid unnecessary institutionalization and receive services \nin the least restrictive, most integrated setting consistent with their needs and choices; \n(2) whether policies and procedures resulting in actual or potential unnecessary \ninstitutionalization violate or place at risk class members’ constitutional rights; and \n(3) whether regional centers’ violations of these rights also violate Business and \nProfessions Code section 17200.  Common factual issues were described this way:  \n(1) Whether respondents “properly conduct individualized assessments by qualified \nprofessionals that are sufficiently person-centered and comprehensive to determine the \ncommunity-based services” necessary to end or prevent unnecessary \ninstitutionalization; (2) whether respondents provide or ensure development of such \n  18\n\n \nservices and options so that class members for whom institutionalization is not \nnecessary actually receive the services to which they are entitled in a timely manner; \nand (3) whether defendants conduct the oversight and monitoring responsibilities \ndesigned to prevent violations of class members’ federal and state rights.  \n  We reiterate that these common issues were framed more broadly than the \nexamples appellants offered to illustrate typicality which the court relied on to base its \nidentification and discussion of  “discrete alledged wrongs.”  Appellants’ typicality \nevidence was generated from declarations of plaintiffs and their guardians whereas the \ncommonality evidence was generated from expert testimony and the testimony of \nrespondents’ staff.   \n  In support of certification and the underlying assertion that proof of systemic \ndeficits in respondents’ policies and practices was amenable to class treatment as \nrequired by Sav-On, appellants submitted pattern and practice evidence including \ntestimony from respondents about their policies and practices; admissions; documents; \nstatistics; expert testimony; and sampling.  They also explained their intended use of \nstatistics and additional sampling for trial.  For example, challenging the legal \nsufficiency of the assessment process, appellants identified as a common factual issue \nwhether respondents used proper standards and criteria for conducting the \nassessments.  They presented expert testimony and deposition testimony from the \nranks of respondents’ professionals on this point.  Further, appellants explained that at \ntrial experts would show that respondents’ policies do not take into account all the \nappropriate standards, and through sampling a subset of IPP’s, this phenomenon \nwould be illustrated.  As well, appellants showed that respondents used sampling for \ncompliance monitoring and evaluation purposes, including sample IPP reviews.   \n  As another example, for the common factual issue of whether respondents \nprovide or ensure development of community-based services and placement options, \nappellants likewise presented expert testimony and testimony from the ranks of \nrespondents’ professionals on this point.  Again, appellants explained that statistical \n  19\n\n \nsampling of individual records could be submitted to confirm and corroborate what \nhad been forthcoming through testimony.  \n  Additionally, appellants proffered common evidence in support of their theory \nof illegality, namely that after the Coffelt settlement period ended, the “pressure was \noff” and respondents lacked the motivation to continue the pace of community \nplacement despite acknowledging that the vast majority of plaintiffs could live in less \nrestrictive settings with appropriate services and supports.  The parties’ experts dueled \non the issue of why there was a decreased pace of community placements after Coffelt \nand whether the present community placement system was sufficient to address the \nissue of unnecessary institutionalization.  However, resolution of this dispute goes to \nthe question of the legality of respondents’ behavior, and does not involve the kind of \nindividual factors that erroneously concerned the trial court. \n  4.  The Trial Court Erroneously Discarded Appellants’ Theory of Recovery and \nRejected Standard Methods of Proof \n  Rejecting a focus on respondents’ classwide conduct despite the suitability of \nthis approach where only declaratory and injunctive relief is sought to remedy \nallegedly illegal practices and policies, the court adhered to the misguided assumption \nthat significant individual inquiries would be necessary to provide class relief.  By \ndiscarding out of hand appellants’ pattern and practice evidence, the trial court turned \nits back on methods of proof commonly allowed in the class action context.  Over the \nyears, numerous courts have approved the use of statistics, sampling, policies, \nadministrative practices, anecdotal evidence, deposition testimony and the like to \nprove classwide behavior on the part of defendants.  (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at \np. 333; Employment Development Dept. v. Superior Court (1981) 30 Cal.3d 256, 265-\n266; Alch v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 339 [noting that in employment \ndiscrimination class actions, plaintiffs “ ‘normally seek to establish a pattern or \npractice of discriminatory intent by combining statistical and nonstatistical evidence, \nthe latter most commonly consisting of anecdotal evidence of individual instances of \ndiscriminatory treatment’ ”]; Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th \n  20\n\n \n715, 750 [referring to statistical sampling as “a different method of proof” and “a \nparticular form of expert testimony”]; Reyes v. Board of Supervisors, supra, \n196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279; Stephens v. Montgomery Ward (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d \n411, 421 [commonality requirement satisfied with statistical data and analysis].) \n  The court’s assumption that the individualized nature of each IPP “would \nrestrict the use of sampling or statistical proof at trial” was incorrect.  This \nassumption, if followed to its logical conclusion, would turn all pattern and practice \nclass litigation upside down.  It suggests that the trier of fact would have to look at \neach person’s IPP to see if a proper assessment was conducted, proper \nrecommendations were made, appropriate community services were available, etc.  \nFollowing this flawed logic, if at some critical mass of individual inquiries it appeared \nthat a pattern and practice of deviating from statutory and constitutional promises was \nemerging, then plaintiffs would have made their case.  On the other hand, consistent \nwith California law, appellants’ theory of recovery and approach is to reveal the \npatterns and practices in the first instance, through expert testimony, admissions, \nstatistical proof, documentary evidence and the like, and then support the findings \nwith corroborative, anecdotal evidence and sampling. \n  The court misunderstood the nature of practice and pattern litigation and \ntherefore based its determination that common factual and legal issues did not \npredominate on improper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions.  These errors led \nthe court to prejudge the merits of appellants’ case.  Either sampling is valid and \nreliable, or it is not.  Either statistical proof is compelling and convincing, or it is not.  \nThese inquiries go to the merits—the quantum of proof appellants are able to amass.  \nIt is not the trial court’s role to become enmeshed with the merits of the underlying \naction, or to concern itself with which side’s experts are more qualified.  At the class \ncertification stage, the concern is whether the evidence plaintiffs will offer is \n“sufficiently generalized in nature.”  (In re Cipro Cases I & II (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th \n402, 412-413.)  Here, appellants only proffered evidence that was generalized in \nnature. \n  21\n\n \nC.  Adequacy of Representation \n  1.  Guiding Principles \n  The adequacy of representation component of the community of interest \nrequirement for class certification comes into play when the party opposing \ncertification brings forth evidence indicating widespread antagonism to the class suit.  \n“ ‘The adequacy inquiry . . . serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named \nparties and the class they seek to represent.’  [Citation.]  ‘. . .  To assure “adequate” \nrepresentation, the class representative’s personal claim must not be inconsistent with \nthe claims of other members of the class.  [Citation.]’  [Citation.]”  (J.P. Morgan & \nCo., Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 195, 212.)  To resolve the \nadequacy question the court “will evaluate ‘the seriousness and extent of conflicts \ninvolved compared to the importance of issues uniting the class; the alternatives to \nclass representation available; the procedures available to limit and prevent unfairness; \nand any other facts bearing on the fairness with which the absent class member is \nrepresented.’  [Citation.]”  (Id. at p. 213.) \n  While it is true that the putative representative cannot adequately protect the \nclass if his or her interests are antagonistic to or in conflict with the objectives of those \nhe or she seeks to represent, a party’s claim of representative status will only be \ndefeated by a conflict that “ ‘goes to the very subject matter of the litigation.’ ”  \n(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 470.)  Thus, antagonism per \nse by members of a class will not automatically preclude certification, given the state’s \npolicy of encouraging the use of the class action device.  (Id. at p. 473.)  As the \nRichmond court pointed out, “ ‘[d]ifferences which do not raise questions as to the \nvery legitimacy of the class action process, . . . but which merely reflect variances in \nview as to the proper outcome of a suit, do not provide reason for a court to refuse to \nhear a class suit.’ ”  (Ibid., quoting Developments—Class Actions (1967) 89 Harv. \nL.Rev. 1318, 1490 (Developments).)  Thus, where factual circumstances differ, or \nclass members disagree as to the proper theory of liability, the trial judge, through \nresort to subclasses, intervention, and the like, may incorporate class differences into \n  22\n\n \nthe litigation process and afford all members their due in deciding the proper outcome.  \n(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 475 citing Developments, at \npp. 1490-1492.)  “ ‘Even if differences among class members are more fundamental, \nhaving to do with the type of relief which should be sought . . . , judicial \naccommodation appears to provide a sufficient mechanism for protection of absentee \ninterests.  So long as the dispute concerns the outcome of litigation, the trial judge is in \na position to isolate differing positions, judge their validity in light of the substantive \nlaw governing the case, and shape the outcome of the suit to give the various class \ninterests the weight to which the law entitles them.’ ”  (Richmond v. Dart Industries, \nInc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 475, quoting Developments, supra, 89 Harv. L.Rev. at \npp. 1490-1492.) \n  2.  The Trial Court’s Ruling \n  Treating the adequacy of representation issue, the trial court stated:  “This is a \npeculiar case because the Court can safely presume that all the class members would \nlike thorough IPPs and the best services possible.  The problem arises because each \ndisabled person is different and ‘the best services possible’ for one person may not be \nappropriate for another person.  The named plaintiffs have consistently asserted that \neach class member is entitled to live in the least restrained setting and that many will \nbenefit from being removed from large institutions and placed into community \nsettings.  The Intervenors, however, argue that for many members of the class ‘the best \nservices possible’ are in large institutions and that it would be detrimental to place \nthem in community settings.  [¶] . . . [¶] . . . The Court has already permitted the \nIntervenors to appear in this action, and they have had the opportunity to participate in \nall court proceedings.  The presence of the Intervenors protects their interests because \nthey could present evidence and make arguments to the trier of fact.  [¶] The Court has \nalso considered that because this case concerns systemwide injunctive relief, the \nIntervenors cannot elect to opt-out of the class.  If the Court provides systemwide \ninjunctive relief, then the policies of the [Department] and the regional centers will \nhave to change and those changes will necessarily affect all persons in the system. \n  23\n\n \n[¶] The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (1) they will \nadequately represent the interests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the \ninterests of the Intervenors can be adequately protected by their presence in this case.  \nThis conclusion is based on a balancing of interests and case management concerns \nand is not directed at the integrity or competence of the named plaintiffs.”  \n  3.  Analysis \n  We initially observe that in terms of the numerical strength of the interveners, \nthere are only 11 individuals, less than .01 percent of the class.  Interveners \nCASH/PRC and CAR are both nonprofit, advocacy organizations.  The organizational \ninterests of these groups, while contributing an important voice, cannot in themselves \nconjure up a conflict within the class.  CASH/PRC also asserts that nearly half of the \ndevelopmental center residents have a family member, friend or conservator who is \naffiliated with the organization.  Even if it were shown that interveners in fact \nrepresented the interests of these residents, such representation would extend to less \nthan 20 percent of the class.  Moreover,  membership or affiliation with CASH/PRC \ndoes not equal agreement with CASH/PRC’s position in this litigation.14  \nAdditionally, while the Lanterman Act does demonstrate an intent to include family \nmembers and conservators in the decision-making process affecting persons with \ndisabilities (see §§ 4502.1, 4500.5), it provides them scant concrete rights.15  (See \n§§ 4505, 4514.5, 4508.)  Indeed, under the Lanterman Act it is the individual with a \n                                            \n14  In connection with its motion to intervene and opposition to appellants’ motion \nfor class certification, CASH/PRC submitted declarations, claiming that its members were \nin uniform opposition to (1) the claims and relief sought by appellants “at least where \nrelatives and conservators of CASH/PCR members are concerned” as well as \n(2) appellants’ attempt to certify a class.  Appellants correctly objected to these statements, \ninserting hearsay, foundational, relevancy and inadmissible opinion objections, but the trial \ncourt never ruled on the objections.  \n15  Their consent is required for electoconvulsive therapy or behavior modification \n(§ 4505) as well as provisional placement in a regional center (§ 4508).  Additionally, \npursuant to section 4514.5, family members are entitled to certain information about a \nresident’s status. \n  24\n\n \ndevelopmental disability—not his or her family, friends, or conservator—who is \nafforded all the legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed by the United States and \nCalifornia Constitutions.  (§ 4502.)  No matter how well intentioned parents and \nconservators may be, they cannot exert their influence to curtail or deny the due \nprocess rights of persons with developmental disabilities.  (See In re Hop (1981) \n29 Cal.3d 82, 93-94.) \n  More to the point of the adequacy analysis, the liability question posed by this \nlawsuit is whether defendants’ policies and practices comply with the law with respect \nto assessments, the IPP process and the array of services and placements available to \nafford community placement and services where appropriate.  Interveners have \nregistered their disagreement with appellants’ view that certain policies and practices \nof defendants are unlawful, but this concern goes to the merits of appellants’ claim, \nnot to the issue of certification.  In other words, this disagreement does not comprise \nantagonism that will defeat certification.  Interveners have no legitimate interest, and \nthus can register no legitimate opposition, to a legal effort to enforce the Lanterman \nAct, the ADA, etc.  Interveners have no legitimate interest in furthering any \ncontinuing violations of the law, or in preventing other class members from seeking \nsystemic relief to correct any violations found by the court.  Whether these laws have \nbeen violated is for the court to decide, with the help of interveners.  As the court \nacknowledged, interveners can protect their interests by presenting evidence and \nmaking arguments to the trier of fact.  \n  It is true, as the trial court articulated, that interveners and appellants have \ndifferent philosophical perspectives on the issue of institutionalization.16  However, \n                                            \n16  Respondents and interveners also make much of the fact that in opposing \nintervention, appellants stated that the interests of the organizational and parent \nrepresentatives “are potentially and actually in conflict with the interests of the plaintiffs \nand the putative plaintiff class.”  Thereafter ensued a discussion of federal and state case \nlaw concerning actual and potential conflicts of interests that courts have articulated as \nexisting between institutionalized individuals and family members.  To be clear, appellants \naddressed conflict between the parent and organizational interveners and the putative class.  \n  25\n\n \nphilosophical differences do not amount to legally cognizable antagonism in this case \nparticularly where, as here, in attempting to make a fool-proof case of antagonism, \ninterveners have consistently overstated, misstated and exaggerated appellants’ \nposition and the relief sought.  As a consequence, the trial court made erroneous \nassumptions about the heart of this litigation. \n  For example, interveners asserted and continue to assert that appellants “seek to \nend all institutional care in California, and advocate placement of all persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities in small, community-based programs.”  The referenced \npages of the complaint alleged that thousands of Californians with developmental \ndisabilities are unnecessarily institutionalized, but in no manner does the complaint \nassert that institutional care should be ended.  And again, interveners insisted below \nthat appellants “seek to move nearly every individual currently living in a \n[developmental center] into a community care facility” and repeat here that appellants \nhave so stated their intention to do that.  The pages interveners reference make it clear \nthat the relief sought in this lawsuit would not dictate the outcome of the process for \nany individual class member and spoke of avoiding unnecessary institutionalization, \nnot of moving everyone to the community.  \n  The trial court perceived the differing philosophical perspectives as a chasm: \nOn the one hand are the named plaintiffs who assert class members’ entitlement to live \nin the least restrictive environment appropriate to the circumstances, and take the \nposition that many will benefit from moving from large institutions to a community \nsetting.  On the other hand are interveners who argue that for many the best services \nare available in institutions and community placement would be detrimental.  These \ndiffering perspectives do not comprise a legal conflict because they are not \ncategorical—rather, they represent “half-full” and “half-empty” variations on the \ntheme of residential placement.  As the trial court understood, both views share the \n                                                                                                                                            \nAppellants did not assert any interest that conflicted with interveners who are actual \nputative class members. \n  26\n\n \ncommon, overarching goal of ensuring the proper and thorough development of IPP’s \nand the availability of services to meet each class member’s needs.  There is no \nconflict between that overarching goal and the subject matter of this lawsuit, namely \nwhether respondents’ policies and practices violate legal mandates calling for \nplacement options and support services in the least restrictive environment \ncommensurate with personal needs. \n  It appears that the trial court was particularly concerned with the reality that \ninterveners could not opt out because the relief sought was systemwide injunctive \nrelief which, if provided, everyone would have to live with.  Interveners stress that \nmore cohesiveness within a class is required when the remedy is limited to injunctive \nand declaratory relief, citing Barnes v. America Tobacco Co. (3d Cir. 1998) 161 F.3d \n127, 142-143.  First, the plaintiffs in Barnes pursued certification of a medical \nmonitoring class under rule 23(b)(2); they did not pursue institutional reform.  Second, \nwhat the court and interveners overlook is the fact that interveners, as well as the state \nactors and regional centers, would be part of the effort forging any systemwide \nsolution to any documented unlawful practices or policies.  Differences among class \nmembers about the type of relief sought and the outcome of the litigation can be \naccommodated by the trial judge whose job is to give the various class interests the \nproper weight under the applicable substantive law.  (Richmond v. Dart Industries, \nInc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 473, citing Developments, supra, 89 Harv. L.Rev. at \npp. 1490-1492.)  In addition, we repeat that the subject matter of this case and the \nreforms pursued are not about the actual outcomes of an individualized IPP process, \nincluding individualized determinations about placement. \nD.  Superior Means for Resolving the Litigation \n  Finally, consistent with the misunderstanding that marked its decision on \ncommonality, the trial court ruled that the alleged wrongs could not readily be cured \non a classwide basis and that the fair hearing procedure set forth at section 4701 et seq. \nan adequate substitute for resolving appellants’ claims.  This ruling cannot stand.  \n  27\n\n \nNonetheless, respondents and interveners continue to cling to the notion that \nindividual action will solve the core issues defined in this litigation.   \n  Respondents and interveners are unable, or unwilling, to grasp the “big picture” \nnature of this litigation.  Appellants’ position is this:  Before the outcome of improved \nindividualized assessment, services and community supports tailored to the unique \nneeds of each person with a developmental disability can be realized, the policies that \nundergird decisionmaking and allocation of resources must be changed.  As we \nexplain, the class action mechanism is the only alternative that can achieve this end. \n  The Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedures are designed generally to decide \n“all issues concerning the rights of persons with developmental disabilities to receive \nservices under [the Lanterman Act].”  (§ 4706, subd. (a).) Any applicant for or \nrecipient of services, or his or her authorized representative, “who is dissatisfied with \nany decision or action of the service agency which he or she believes to be illegal, \ndiscriminatory, or not in the recipient’s or applicant’s best interest” is afforded the \nopportunity for a statutory fair hearing.  (§ 4710.5, subd. (a).) \n  Appellants have sought systemic mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief—\nrelief that the fair hearing process cannot provide.  By definition, design, structure and \nscope, the Lanterman Act fair hearing procedure is for individual adjudication of \nclaims and is thus unavailable for, and/or incapable of, delivering classwide systemic \nrelief.  No one disputes, for example, that a hearing officer presiding over the fair \nhearing procedure adjudicates individual claims and grievances and cannot grant the \nrequested injunctive relief.  Moreover, should an individual petition for writ of \nmandate on a test case basis, any resulting writ would constitute an inadequate remedy \nbecause class members are not parties to an individual decree and could not enforce \nthe writ by contempt or supplemental decree.  (Miller v. Woods (1983) \n148 Cal.App.3d 862, 872.)  The class action mechanism thus is favorable in this \ninstance because it affords finality of judgment binding on all parties and the \nenforceability of class judgments through contempt or supplemental decrees. \n  28\n\n \n  Further, without class treatment there could be multiple actions that would \nburden the litigants and the courts with cumulative and excessive expenses, discovery \nefforts and evidence.  We recognize that the devices of joinder, consolidation, \nintervention and the test case are available in the context of multiple litigation, and the \nDepartment specifically points out that putative class members could intervene in a \ntest case to ensure that a writ of mandate was properly enforced.  First, the outcome of \na motion to intervene would not be a foregone conclusion.  Second, these devices are \ninsufficient to vindicate legal rights because their use is premised on a group of parties \nwith the economic and general wherewithal, willingness and ability to look after their \nown interests individually through individual suits.  (Rose v. City of Hayward (1981) \n126 Cal.App.3d 926, 934-935.) \n  The very nature of this class cries out for a class treatment and a systemic \napproach because the individuals whose rights allegedly have been violated are \npersons with cognitive or other severe disabilities, many without the resources to \nundertake the complex and daunting task of suing the myriad agencies involved in the \ndelivery of services.  The reviewing court in Reyes v. Board of Supervisors, supra, \n196 Cal.App.3d at page 1270, footnote 6, said it well:  “ ‘It is well settled that class \nactions are an appropriate procedure in government benefit cases where statutes and \npolicies are likely to have an impact upon a broad class of recipients. . . .’  [Citation.]  \n[C]lass actions for injunctive or declaratory relief serve the additional objectives \nparticularly important in government benefits litigation, including institutional \nchanges, ‘facilitating enforcement of a favorable judgment, and protecting the interests \nof affected class members from the burden of bringing individual actions to establish \nthe applicability of a decision for their benefit.  [Citation.]’  [Citation.]” \nIII.  DISPOSITION \n  The order denying class certification cannot stand because it was based on \nimproper criteria and incorrect legal assumptions.  Had the trial court properly \nanalyzed appellants’ theory of recovery and approach, it would have found \ncommonality.  Had it understood the type of conflict that will defeat adequacy of \n  29\n\n \nrepresentation, it would not have concluded that appellants failed to establish this \nelement.  And finally with these proper understandings it would have recognized that \nthe class action was the only way to resolve appellants’ claims.  Therefore, we reverse \nthe judgment and direct that the trial court certify the class. \n \n \n \n \n \n              _________________________ \n              Reardon, Acting P.

Ct. No. 2002-038715) \n   \nMajority Opinion \n  \nNearly 15 years after passage of the landmark Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act),1 a group \nof  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  sued  the  Department  of  Developmental  Services  (Department)  and  other \ndefendants to secure their entitlement to community living arrangements under the Lanterman Act. ( Coffelt v. Department of \nDevelopmental Services (Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, 1994, No. 916401) ( Coffelt).) In 1994, Coffelt was resolved with a \nstipulated class action settlement. \n  \nThe current lawsuit2 is the second major suit prosecuted to enforce the right of persons with developmental disabilities to live \nin the least restrictive environment commensurate with their needs, thereby avoiding unnecessary institutionalization. The \nfocus is on the systemic failure of the state agencies and regional centers to provide proper oversight and enforce \nconstitutional, statutory and regulatory mandates to place individuals in less restrictive community settings when appropriate. \nOnly injunctive and declaratory relief is sought. Cognizant that individualized outcomes were not being sought, the trial court \nnonetheless concluded that proof would focus on the individual circumstances of class members. Denying class certification, \nthe court determined that appellants demonstrated ascertainability, numerosity, typicality and adequacy of counsel but failed \nto establish commonality, adequacy of class representation and superiority. As we explain, the court based its decision on \nimproper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment. \n  \nI. Background \n1 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \n  \nA. Overview of Legal Framework \n  \nEnacted  in  1977,  the  Lanterman  Act  establishes  a  comprehensive  scheme  for  providing  services  to  people  with \ndevelopmental disabilities.3 The stated policy of the legislation is to establish “[a]n array of services and supports … which is \nsufficiently complete to meet the needs and choices of each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or \ndegree of disability, and at each stage of life and to support their integration into the mainstream life of the community. To \nthe maximum extent feasible, services and supports should be available throughout the state to prevent the dislocation of \npersons with developmental disabilities from their home communities. [ ¶ ] Services and supports should be available to \nenable persons with developmental disabilities to approximate the pattern of everyday living available to people without \ndisabilities of the same age.” ( § 4501.) \n  \nThe Lanterman Act enumerates legal rights of persons with developmental disabilities. ( § 4502.) These include the “right to \ntreatment and habilitation services and supports in the least restrictive environment” and the “right to dignity, privacy, and \nhumane care,” with treatment, services and supports provided in natural community settings to the maximum extent possible. \n(  §  4502,  subds.  (a)  &  (b).)  As  our  Supreme  Court  stated  in  Association  for  Retarded  Citizens  v.  Department  of \nDevelopmental Services (1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 391: “[T]he Act defines a basic right and a corresponding basic obligation: the \nright which it grants to the developmentally disabled person is to be provided with services that enable him to live a more \nindependent and productive life in the community; the obligation which it imposes on the state is to provide such services.” \n  \nA network of 21 regional centers4 is responsible for determining eligibility, assessing needs and coordinating and delivering \ndirect services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families within a defined geographical area. ( § 4620 et \nseq.) Designed on a service coordination model, the purpose of the regional centers is to “assist persons with developmental \ndisabilities and their families in securing those services and supports which maximize opportunities and choices for living, \nworking, learning, and recreating in the community.” ( § 4640.7, subd. (a).) The Department allocates funds to the centers for \noperations and the purchasing of services, including funding to purchase community-based services and supports. ( §§ 4620, \n4621, 4787.) \n  \nThe Department is the designated state agency with “jurisdiction over the execution of the laws relating to the care, custody, \nand treatment of developmentally disabled persons … .” ( § 4416.) Accordingly, it is charged with (1) monitoring the \nregional centers to ensure that they comply with federal and state law, and (2) taking action to support the centers in \nachieving compliance and in providing “high quality services and supports to consumers5 and their families.” ( §§ 4434, \nsubds. (a) & (b), 4500.5, subd. (d), 4501.) \n  \nThe specific rights of persons with developmental disabilities and the corresponding obligations of the state are determined \nthrough an individual program plan (IPP) procedure that meets common statutory requirements. ( §§ 4646-4648.) The IPP is \ndeveloped by a planning team that includes the consumer, his or her legally authorized representative, and one or more \nregional center representatives. ( § 4512, subd. (j).) The goals and objectives developed through the IPP process should \nmaximize opportunities for the individual to be part of community life; enjoy increased control over his or her life; acquire \npositive roles in community life; and develop the skills to accomplish the same. ( § 4646.5, subd. (a)(2).) In securing services \nto implement the IPP, the highest preference is afforded services and supports that allow minors to live with their families \nand adults to live as independently as possible in the community. ( § 4648, subd. (a)(1)-(2).) \n  \nThe Department directly operates seven public institutions (developmental centers) which house approximately 3,000 of the \nstate’s more than 200,000 persons with developmental disabilities. (See §§ 4440, 4440.5.) Approximately 4,600 persons live \nin other institutions. \n   \nB. Community Placement Plan \n  \nThe Lanterman Act includes provisions to create and implement a community placement plan (CPP) process designed to \nmove individuals with developmental disabilities from the developmental centers to the community. ( § 4418.25.) The \nDepartment is responsible for establishing policies and procedures for development of annual CPP’s by each regional center \nand allocates funds for implementation. ( § 4418.25, subds. (a) & (d).) Under the CPP mandate the regional centers must \nidentify consumers for possible transition to community living arrangements, coordinate with the developmental centers and \n2 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nother entities on an IPP process to ensure a successful transition, and develop a supporting budget to accomplish the goal. ( \n§§  4418.25,  4418.3.)  The  CPP  provides  for  dedicated  funding  for  regional  centers  to  move  selected  persons  from \ndevelopmental centers to the community, and to prevent developmental center placement in the first instance. ( § 4418.25, \nsubds. (b) & (d).) \n   \nC. Agnews Closure Plan \n  \nIn 2005, the Department submitted a plan to the Legislature calling for the closure of Agnews Developmental Center \n(Agnews) by June 30, 2007. The Bay Area regional centers collaborated in this effort by engaging in the individualized \nplanning and resource development and other activities authorized in their CPP pursuant to section 4418.25. The Agnews \nclosure plan proposes “an enhanced community service delivery system in the Bay Area that can meet the needs of the \nmajority of Agnews’ residents.” To that end the plan provides for development of new resources and innovative programs, \nincluding a sustainable increase in appropriate housing. \n   \nD. Coffelt \n  \nIn 1991, the Coffelt class action was brought against the Department and others challenging the state’s implementation of the \nLanterman Act on many fronts. The parties stipulated to a class action settlement in 1994. The settlement included \ncertification of a settlement class comprised of developmental center residents recommended for community placement, and \nrequired systemic reforms as well as a net reduction in 2,000 persons in the developmental center population over a five-year \nperiod. \n  \nDuring the settlement period, the developmental center population declined by more than the targeted amount, but thereafter \nmovement  of  individuals  from  these  institutions  to  the  community  settings  slowed  considerably.  In  the  words  of  a \nDepartment employee: “[A]fter the Coffelt settlement agreement was over, the pressure was off… .” \n   \nE. The Present Litigation \n  \nAppellants filed suit in January 2002. The fifth amended complaint is the operative pleading, filed in July 2005. The \nproposed class is defined as follows: “All California residents with a developmental disability, as defined in … section \n4512(b), who are (or become) institutionalized,6 and those who are at risk7 of being institutionalized, in congregate residential \nfacilities having a capacity of 16 or more individuals.” \n  \nThe preamble to the fifth amended complaint sets forth the nature of the controversy permeating the nine causes of action:8 \n“Thousands of Californians with developmental disabilities are needlessly isolated and segregated from mainstream society \nin large congregate public and private institutions. Every year hundreds more find themselves at risk of institutionalization \ndue to the lack of appropriate community supports and crisis intervention. Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to restore their legal \nrights to freedom from such institutionalization and to live, with appropriate supports, in our neighborhoods. [ ¶ ] The current \ncircumstances violate [f]ederal and [s]tate law. In the [Lanterman Act] … California created an entitlement for people with \ndevelopmental disabilities to an array of services and supports sufficiently complete to meet their needs and choices, to \nsupport their integration into the mainstream life of the community and to enable them to approximate the pattern of \neveryday living available to people without disabilities… . Despite this mandate, thousands of people with developmental \ndisabilities are unnecessarily institutionalized because the [s]tate and the regional centers have failed in their obligation under \nthe Lanterman Act to develop and provide community-based alternatives.” \n  \nThe preamble goes on to introduce the ADA and the holdings in Olmstead v. L.C. (1999) 527 U.S. 581, 600, that (1) \n“unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination”; and (2) states are required to \nprovide community based treatment when, among other factors, the placement can be reasonably accommodated ( id. at p. \n607). Continuing, the preamble states: “[I]n violation of the ADA, California has failed to take adequate steps to reduce the \nunnecessary institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities at a reasonable pace. [ ¶ ] Unnecessary segregation \nalso contravenes other [s]tate and [f]ederal statutory rights as well as fundamental constitutional rights, including the rights to \nliberty, privacy and freedom of association. [ ¶ ] In spite of these rights and obligations, state and regional center defendants \ndo not do adequate assessments of individuals’ ability to benefit from community living, do not do adequate program \nplanning, and therefore, do not develop sufficient quality programs to meet the needs of people with developmental \n3 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \ndisabilities. Because of defendants’ policies and practices, and because California continues to under-fund its community \nservice system, there is a continuing shortage of stable, quality community living arrangements and ancillary supports that \nwould enable people with developmental disabilities to achieve their potential for independence and integration into the \ncommunity. The further and inevitable result of defendants’ conduct is the continued unnecessary institutionalization of \nthousands of people with developmental disabilities.” \n  \nAppellants requested declaratory and injunctive relief as well as orders pursuant to a writ of mandate compelling defendants \nto comply with enumerated duties. \n   \nF. Appellants’ Evidence and Claims \n  \nAccording to appellants’ evidence, respondents have acknowledged that the vast majority of class members could live in less \nrestrictive settings with appropriate supports and services. One Department official indicated “it is possible to serve the \nmajority of people in the community if the appropriate resources are there and if the capacity of the community exists as a \ngeneral principle.” When queried about the percentage of people in developmental centers who could live in the community \nwith appropriate supports and services, another Department official responded “100 percent” and agreed that people with the \nmost significant support challenges can be served in noninstitutional settings. One regional center director stated his belief \nthat “everyone who is in the developmental center can be served in a community setting.” Another testified that “all of the \napproximately 125 people that reside at the developmental center from the [catchment] area are capable of living in the \ncommunity successfully.” \n  \nAppellants point to the Agnews closure plan as a model demonstrating the feasibility of moving a substantial majority of \ndevelopmental center residents to less restrictive, community placements. The populations served by other developmental \ncenters are similar, yet no plans are afoot to close or otherwise transition large portions of the residents of those institutions to \ncommunity settings. Thus, according to appellants, except for the Agnews closure plan, the CPP’s, as implemented by \nregional centers and the Department, are “woefully inadequate” in meeting the least restrictive environment mandate of the \nLanterman Act and other laws. \n  \nAnd, although the Department is responsible for establishing policies and procedures for the annual CPP’s developed by the \nregional centers, it has not developed “a priori standards as such” for determining whether CPP placement goals are adequate. \nThe Department has never directed a regional center to raise its placement goal, but it has requested that a center lower its \ngoal. \n  \nThe Department has developed an incentive system whereby operational dollars will be withheld proportionally from a \nregional center if it does not meet its placement goals. In fact, this system can work as an incentive for regional centers to \nseek fewer placements than possible in order to avoid penalties for trying harder. At least one regional center penalized under \nthis system subsequently reduced the number of placements in its CPP by half to avoid a future penalty. The CPP manager \nfor that center called the allocation system “very troubling.” \n  \nLyn Rucker, with decades of national as well as international experience working with government agencies and the courts to \ndevelop and implement systems that promote community services for individuals with developmental disabilities, declared \nthat under the CPP process “except for residents of [Agnews], the majority of developmental center residents will have to \nwait for decades for an opportunity to live in the community at the pace currently being achieved in California.” As an \nexample, Sonoma Developmental Center is the largest developmental center with a population of 754 as of August 31, 2005. \nThis institution averages 20 community placements a year. Nonetheless, Sonoma Developmental Center serves a population \nof persons with developmental disabilities that are no more severe than those in Agnews, where 85 percent of residents will \nmove to the community under the closure plan. \n  \nIn addition to residents of developmental centers, another 4,462 persons live in other congregate institutions. Although the \nCPP applies only to those residing in developmental centers or who are at risk of developmental center placement, the CPP \n“is  not  intended  to  limit  the  department’s  or  regional  centers’  responsibility  to  otherwise  conduct  assessments  and \nindividualized program planning, and to provide needed services and supports in the least restrictive, most integrated setting \nin accord with the [Lanterman Act].” ( § 4418.25, subd. (b).) Nevertheless, there is no policy or planning process comparable \nto the CPP process for reducing the number of consumers living in large, nondevelopmental center congregate institutions. \n4 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nMoreover, the Department does not require regional centers to have a plan for deflecting people for admission to these \nfacilities. \n   \nG. Motions to Intervene and for Class Certification \n  \nEarly in the litigation, 10 developmental center residents who wished to remain in institutions and two organizations \nrepresenting parents, conservators and friends of developmental center residents moved to intervene.9 Interveners argued that \nthe interests of plaintiffs were hostile to their interests, plaintiffs were not adequate representatives, and the relief they sought \nwould impair the rights of those persons whose needs are best met in a developmental center. Granting leave to intervene, the \ncourt limited the complaint in intervention to ensuring “that the legal rights of parents and guardians to participate in the \nplanning process and the ability of professionals to recommend placement in development centers are not adversely affected \nby any judgment in this action.” \n  \nAppellants filed the motion for class certification that is the subject of this appeal in September 2005. The trial court denied \nthe motion, concluding that (1) appellants could not satisfy the element of commonality because the issues dictated a \nconcentration on the individualized circumstances of class members; (2) appellants had not demonstrated that they would \nadequately represent the interests of all putative class members or that the interests of interveners would be protected \nadequately by their presence in the litigation; and (3) the wrongs asserted could not readily be cured on a classwide basis, but \nthe hearing procedure under section 4700 et seq. would be effective for redress of individual grievances. This appeal \nfollowed. \n  \nII. Discussion \n  \nA. Certification Requirements; Standard of Review \n  \nCode of Civil Procedure section 382 permits class actions “when the question is one of a common or general interest, of \nmany persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court … .” The \ncertification question does not inquire whether the action is factually or legally meritorious. Rather, the proponent of \ncertification must establish the existence of a well-defined community of interest among class members. ( Lockheed Martin \nCorp. v. Superior Court (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, 1104.) The community of interest requirement embraces three factors: (1) \ncommon questions of law or fact that predominate over questions affecting individual members; (2) class representatives with \nclaims or defenses that are typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class. ( Ibid.) \n  \nAs well, in assessing the appropriateness of certification trial courts are charged with carefully weighing the respective \nbenefits and burdens of class litigation to the end that maintenance of the class action will only be permitted where \nsubstantial benefits accrue to the litigants and the court. ( Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435 .) This \nobligation entails considering the role of the class action mechanism in deterring and redressing wrongdoing. ( Id. at pp. 445- \n446.) Further, the substantial benefits analysis raises the question whether a class action is superior to individual lawsuits and \nother alternative procedures for resolving the controversy. ( Basurco v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 110, \n120-121; Caro v. Proctor & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 660-661. \n  \nTrial courts have wide discretion with regard to class certification. Thus we will not overturn the lower court’s certification \ndecision which is supported by substantial evidence unless it (1) used improper criteria; or (2) made erroneous legal \nassumptions. ( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470; Reese v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (1999) 73 \nCal.App.4th 1225, 1229, 1233.) We do not decide in the first instance whether the requested class is appropriate. Rather, our \njob is to decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying certification. ( Reese, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. \n1233.) A certification ruling not supported by substantial evidence will not stand. ( Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court, \nsupra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1106.) By the same token, even if the decision denying certification is supported by substantial \nevidence, we will reverse if it is based on improper criteria or incorrect assumptions. ( Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co., supra, 23 \nCal.4th at p. 436.) \n   \nB. Commonality \n   \n1. Introduction \n5 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \n  \nIt is the burden of the proponent of class certification to show, with substantial evidence, that common questions of law or \nfact predominate over questions affecting individual members. ( Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 29 Cal.4th \nat pp. 1104, 1106.) And whether such substantial evidence exists involves analysis of whether the proponent’s “theory of \nrecovery” is likely to prove compatible with class treatment. ( Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th \n319, 327 ( Sav-On).) \n  \nThe trial court delivered a ruling on the issue of commonality that was marked by contradictions and inconsistencies. While \nacknowledging that appellants were seeking only systemic relief, and not individual solutions to individual problems, it \nnonetheless insisted on defining the claims asserted in the litigation with respect to the “common discrete wrongs10 that affect \nindividual class members.” Thus, instead of focusing on the similar but broader list of common legal and factual questions \nwhich appellants provided, and the proof offered for the same, the court seized instead on appellants’ examples of typicality \nto define discrete wrongs common to each individual which it concluded demanded individualized inquiries. \n  \nCompounding this error, the trial court filtered the analysis and considerations required to address these issues solely through \nthe lens of the individual and his or her IPP, rather than taking a broader, systemic view concentrating on respondents’ \npolicies and practices. Upon undertaking its examination of discrete wrongs, the court concluded that common issues of fact \nwould  not  predominate  because  the  deficiencies,  variables  and  pertinent  lines  of  inquiry  would  be  individualized. \nRespondents cling to this single-minded approach on appeal. \n  \nAdditionally, in choosing to focus on discrete wrongs, the court relied substantially on J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez (10th Cir. \n1999) 186 F.3d 1280, 128911 with its refusal “to read an allegation of systemic failures as a moniker for meeting the class \naction requirements… . For a common question of law to exist, the putative class must share a discrete legal question of some \nkind.” Nevertheless, the court also acknowledged that under California law, courts can take an aggregate approach to \nplaintiffs’ claims. Specifically, the court itself noted that in Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at page 324, the Supreme Court did not \nseparately analyze various statutory and common law claims because all claims focused on whether class members were \nmisclassified as exempt from overtime laws. (See also Mendoza v. County of Tulare (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 403, 407, 417 \n[rejecting defendants’ assertion that plaintiff-prisoners’ right to relief based on 10 causes of action alleging numerous state \nand federal statutory and constitutional violations simply amounted to aggregation of individual claims].) \n  \nIn an effort to accommodate appellants’ theory of the case, the court went on to spell out what it called an “alternate \napproach” for class claims seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief and centering on whether appellants demonstrated \nthat respondents “‘acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.’ [(rule 23(b)(2).]”12 (See fn. 11, ante.) \nAnd, not surprisingly, it concluded that a different result would occur if the spotlight were on respondents’ policies instead of \nthe class members’ claims. Nonetheless, and puzzlingly, the court rejected an approach centered on respondents’ common \npolicies and practices generally applicable to all putative class members. It reasoned that such a focus would require the trier \nof fact to pay significant attention to how the policies and practices affect each class member through the development, \ncontent and implementation of individual IPP’s, and thus the use of sampling or statistical proof would be restricted. We \nconclude that the trial court ignored or misunderstood the guiding principles of California law on the commonality question \nand thus based its denial of certification on improper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions. \n   \n2. Sav-On Sets the Standard \n  \nSav-On teaches that in resolving whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court’s certification order, “we \nconsider whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is, as an analytical matter, likely to prove \namenable to class treatment.” ( Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 327.) As part of this process, we consistently look to the \nallegations in the complaint and the declarations of attorneys representing the class. ( Ibid.) \n  \nSav-On concerned allegations that the drugstore chain misclassified employees as exempt from overtime laws and thus failed \nto pay overtime compensation owing to the plaintiffs. Despite the defendant’s argument that determination of any liability for \nunpaid overtime compensation depended on making individual computations, the plaintiff produced substantial evidence that \nthe defendant’s policy and practice was one of deliberate misclassification and that due in part to operational standardization, \na uniform classification policy based solely on job descriptions resulted in widespread de facto miscalculation. ( Save-On, \nsupra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 328-329.) Overturning the Court of Appeal’s denial of class certification, the Supreme Court held \n6 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nthat even allowing for individual damage determinations, either of the plaintiffs’ theories was amenable to class treatment. ( \nId. at pp. 329-330.) Thus, while calculation of individual damages might be required down the road, this possibility did not \nforeclose taking common evidence on the misclassification issues. ( Id. at p. 332.) Moreover, the court emphasized the \ncommunity of interest requirement for certification does not mandate that class members have uniform or identical claims. ( \nId. at p. 338.) Further, in deciding whether the commonality requirement has been satisfied, courts may consider pattern and \npractice, statistical and sampling evidence, expert testimony and other indicators of a given defendant’s classwide practices in \norder to assess whether that common behavior toward similarly situated plaintiffs renders class certification appropriate. ( Id. \nat p. 333.) \n  \nSimilarly, in Reyes v. Board of Supervisors (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1263, 1278-1279,13 a government benefits case attacking \na county’s practice of depriving general relief recipients of benefits, the reviewing court explained that the necessity for class \nmembers to establish eligibility and damages individually did not mean that individual fact questions predominated. It also \nrejected the defendant’s argument that even if the county had a common duty, proof of whether it actually administered the \nprogram in question improperly depended on individual factual determinations. Rather, the propriety of the county’s actions \ncould be established by reviewing regulations, testimony of employees, and a sampling of representative cases. ( Ibid.) \n  \nSo, too, a community of interest was found in a prisoners’ right case despite the county’s assertion that any right to relief \ndepended on facts peculiar to each prisoner’s case, thereby amounting “to a mere aggregation of individual claims.” ( \nMendoza v. County of Tulare, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at p. 417.) Instead, to establish a right to a remedy, the plaintiffs could \nfocus on the defendants’ actions and omissions. If the trial court ultimately found statutory and/or constitutional violations, \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief would redress systemic violations common to the class notwithstanding that some would \napply only to individuals. ( Id. at p. 418.) \n   \n3. Appellants Met the Standard \n  \nHere, as in the above cases, appellants’ theory of recovery, as gleaned from the pleadings and declarations, focuses on the \ncommon practices, policies, acts and omissions of the state actors and regional centers. The overarching theme is that there is \na pattern and practice of failure to meet constitutional, statutory and regulatory mandates to provide services and place class \nmembers in less restrictive settings, and the systemic effect of this failure is to impinge plaintiffs’ rights under state and \nfederal law. As stated without ambiguity in their memorandum supporting class certification: “[P]laintiffs are not asking for \nindividual relief for the thousands of members of the class—each of whom, obviously, does have unique needs. Rather, \nplaintiffs seek to compel those state and local entities responsible for providing, as an ‘entitlement,’ a ‘” pattern of facilities \nand services … sufficiently complete to meet the needs of each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or \ndegree of handicap, and at each stage of life” [citation]’ to put in place the procedures, practices and infrastructure that will \nensure that they carry out these obligations to class members. The systemic relief plaintiffs seek could not be obtained on a \ncase-by-case basis.” \n  \nIn this same memorandum, appellants also detailed the legal and factual issues common to the class. Common legal issues \nwere threefold: (1) Whether respondents’ policies and procedures violate the rights of class members under various \nenumerated state and federal statutes to avoid unnecessary institutionalization and receive services in the least restrictive, \nmost integrated setting consistent with their needs and choices; (2) whether policies and procedures resulting in actual or \npotential unnecessary institutionalization violate or place at risk class members’ constitutional rights; and (3) whether \nregional centers’ violations of these rights also violate Business and Professions Code section 17200. Common factual issues \nwere described this way: (1) Whether respondents “properly conduct individualized assessments by qualified professionals \nthat are sufficiently person-centered and comprehensive to determine the community-based services” necessary to end or \nprevent unnecessary institutionalization; (2) whether respondents provide or ensure development of such services and options \nso that class members for whom institutionalization is not necessary actually receive the services to which they are entitled in \na timely manner; and (3) whether defendants conduct the oversight and monitoring responsibilities designed to prevent \nviolations of class members’ federal and state rights. \n  \nWe reiterate that these common issues were framed more broadly than the examples appellants offered to illustrate typicality \nwhich the court relied on to base its identification and discussion of “discrete alledged wrongs.” Appellants’ typicality \nevidence was generated from declarations of plaintiffs and their guardians whereas the commonality evidence was generated \nfrom expert testimony and the testimony of respondents’ staff. \n7 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \n  \nIn support of certification and the underlying assertion that proof of systemic deficits in respondents’ policies and practices \nwas amenable to class treatment as required by Sav-On, appellants submitted pattern and practice evidence including \ntestimony from respondents about their policies and practices; admissions; documents; statistics; expert testimony; and \nsampling. They also explained their intended use of statistics and additional sampling for trial. For example, challenging the \nlegal sufficiency of the assessment process, appellants identified as a common factual issue whether respondents used proper \nstandards and criteria for conducting the assessments. They presented expert testimony and deposition testimony from the \nranks of respondents’ professionals on this point. Further, appellants explained that at trial experts would show that \nrespondents’ policies do not take into account all the appropriate standards, and through sampling a subset of IPP’s, this \nphenomenon would be illustrated. As well, appellants showed that respondents used sampling for compliance monitoring and \nevaluation purposes, including sample IPP reviews. \n  \nAs another example, for the common factual issue of whether respondents provide or ensure development of community-\nbased services and placement options, appellants likewise presented expert testimony and testimony from the ranks of \nrespondents’ professionals on this point. Again, appellants explained that statistical sampling of individual records could be \nsubmitted to confirm and corroborate what had been forthcoming through testimony. \n  \nAdditionally, appellants proffered common evidence in support of their theory of illegality, namely that after the Coffelt \nsettlement period ended, the “pressure was off” and respondents lacked the motivation to continue the pace of community \nplacement despite acknowledging that the vast majority of plaintiffs could live in less restrictive settings with appropriate \nservices and supports. The parties’ experts dueled on the issue of why there was a decreased pace of community placements \nafter Coffelt and whether the present community placement system was sufficient to address the issue of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. However, resolution of this dispute goes to the question of the legality of respondents’ behavior, and does \nnot involve the kind of individual factors that erroneously concerned the trial court. \n   \n4. The Trial Court Erroneously Discarded Appellants’ Theory of Recovery and Rejected Standard Methods of Proof \n  \nRejecting a focus on respondents’ classwide conduct despite the suitability of this approach where only declaratory and \ninjunctive relief is sought to remedy allegedly illegal practices and policies, the court adhered to the misguided assumption \nthat significant individual inquiries would be necessary to provide class relief. By discarding out of hand appellants’ pattern \nand practice evidence, the trial court turned its back on methods of proof commonly allowed in the class action context. Over \nthe years, numerous courts have approved the use of statistics, sampling, policies, administrative practices, anecdotal \nevidence, deposition testimony and the like to prove classwide behavior on the part of defendants. ( Sav-On, supra, 34 \nCal.4th at p. 333; Employment Development Dept. v. Superior Court (1981) 30 Cal.3d 256, 265-266; Alch v. Superior Court \n(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 339 [noting that in employment discrimination class actions, plaintiffs ” ‘normally seek to establish a \npattern or practice of discriminatory intent by combining statistical and nonstatistical evidence, the latter most commonly \nconsisting of anecdotal evidence of individual instances of discriminatory treatment”’]; Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2004) \n115 Cal.App.4th 715, 750 [referring to statistical sampling as “a different method of proof” and “a particular form of expert \ntestimony”]; Reyes v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1279; Stephens v. Montgomery Ward (1987) 193 \nCal.App.3d 411, 421 [commonality requirement satisfied with statistical data and analysis].) \n  \nThe court’s assumption that the individualized nature of each IPP “would restrict the use of sampling or statistical proof at \ntrial” was incorrect. This assumption, if followed to its logical conclusion, would turn all pattern and practice class litigation \nupside down. It suggests that the trier of fact would have to look at each person’s IPP to see if a proper assessment was \nconducted, proper recommendations were made, appropriate community services were available, etc. Following this flawed \nlogic, if at some critical mass of individual inquiries it appeared that a pattern and practice of deviating from statutory and \nconstitutional promises was emerging, then plaintiffs would have made their case. On the other hand, consistent with \nCalifornia law, appellants’ theory of recovery and approach is to reveal the patterns and practices in the first instance, through \nexpert testimony, admissions, statistical proof, documentary evidence and the like, and then support the findings with \ncorroborative, anecdotal evidence and sampling. \n  \nThe court misunderstood the nature of practice and pattern litigation and therefore based its determination that common \nfactual and legal issues did not predominate on improper criteria and erroneous legal assumptions. These errors led the court \nto prejudge the merits of appellants’ case. Either sampling is valid and reliable, or it is not. Either statistical proof is \n8 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \ncompelling and convincing, or it is not. These inquiries go to the merits—the quantum of proof appellants are able to amass. \nIt is not the trial court’s role to become enmeshed with the merits of the underlying action, or to concern itself with which \nside’s experts are more qualified. At the class certification stage, the concern is whether the evidence plaintiffs will offer is \n“sufficiently generalized in nature.” ( In re Cipro Cases I & II (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 402, 412-413.) Here, appellants only \nproffered evidence that was generalized in nature. \n   \nC. Adequacy of Representation \n   \n1. Guiding Principles \n  \nThe adequacy of representation component of the community of interest requirement for class certification comes into play \nwhen the party opposing certification brings forth evidence indicating widespread antagonism to the class suit. “‘The \nadequacy inquiry … serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.’ \n[Citation.] ‘… To assure “adequate” representation, the class representative’s personal claim must not be inconsistent with \nthe claims of other members of the class. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” ( J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 113 \nCal.App.4th 195, 212.) To resolve the adequacy question the court “will evaluate ‘the seriousness and extent of conflicts \ninvolved compared to the importance of issues uniting the class; the alternatives to class representation available; the \nprocedures available to limit and prevent unfairness; and any other facts bearing on the fairness with which the absent class \nmember is represented.’ [Citation.]” ( Id. at p. 213.) \n  \nWhile it is true that the putative representative cannot adequately protect the class if his or her interests are antagonistic to or \nin conflict with the objectives of those he or she seeks to represent, a party’s claim of representative status will only be \ndefeated by a conflict that “‘goes to the very subject matter of the litigation.”’ ( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 \nCal.3d at p. 470.) Thus, antagonism per se by members of a class will not automatically preclude certification, given the \nstate’s policy of encouraging the use of the class action device. ( Id. at p. 473.) As the Richmond court pointed out, \n“‘[d]ifferences which do not raise questions as to the very legitimacy of the class action process, … but which merely reflect \nvariances in view as to the proper outcome of a suit, do not provide reason for a court to refuse to hear a class suit.”’ ( Ibid., \nquoting  Developments—Class  Actions  (1967)  89  Harv.  L.Rev.  1318,  1490  (  Developments).)  Thus,  where  factual \ncircumstances differ, or class members disagree as to the proper theory of liability, the trial judge, through resort to \nsubclasses, intervention, and the like, may incorporate class differences into the litigation process and afford all members \ntheir due in deciding the proper outcome. ( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. 475 citing Developments, \nat pp. 1490-1492 .) “‘Even if differences among class members are more fundamental, having to do with the type of relief \nwhich should be sought …, judicial accommodation appears to provide a sufficient mechanism for protection of absentee \ninterests. So long as the dispute concerns the outcome of litigation, the trial judge is in a position to isolate differing \npositions, judge their validity in light of the substantive law governing the case, and shape the outcome of the suit to give the \nvarious class interests the weight to which the law entitles them.”’ ( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. \n475, quoting Developments, supra, 89 Harv. L.Rev. at pp. 1490-1492.) \n   \n2. The Trial Court’s Ruling \n  \nTreating the adequacy of representation issue, the trial court stated: “This is a peculiar case because the Court can safely \npresume that all the class members would like thorough IPPs and the best services possible. The problem arises because each \ndisabled person is different and ‘the best services possible’ for one person may not be appropriate for another person. The \nnamed plaintiffs have consistently asserted that each class member is entitled to live in the least restrained setting and that \nmany will benefit from being removed from large institutions and placed into community settings. The Intervenors, however, \nargue that for many members of the class ‘the best services possible’ are in large institutions and that it would be detrimental \nto place them in community settings. [ ¶ ] … [ ¶ ] … The Court has already permitted the Intervenors to appear in this action, \nand they have had the opportunity to participate in all court proceedings. The presence of the Intervenors protects their \ninterests because they could present evidence and make arguments to the trier of fact. [ ¶ ] The Court has also considered that \nbecause this case concerns systemwide injunctive relief, the Intervenors cannot elect to opt-out of the class. If the Court \nprovides systemwide injunctive relief, then the policies of the [Department] and the regional centers will have to change and \nthose changes will necessarily affect all persons in the system. [ ¶ ] The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated \neither (1) they will adequately represent the interests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the interests of the \nIntervenors can be adequately protected by their presence in this case. This conclusion is based on a balancing of interests \n9 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nand case management concerns and is not directed at the integrity or competence of the named plaintiffs.” \n   \n3. Analysis \n  \nWe initially observe that in terms of the numerical strength of the interveners, there are only 11 individuals, less than .01 \npercent of the class. Interveners CASH/PRC and CAR are both nonprofit, advocacy organizations. The organizational \ninterests of these groups, while contributing an important voice, cannot in themselves conjure up a conflict within the class. \nCASH/PRC also asserts that nearly half of the developmental center residents have a family member, friend or conservator \nwho is affiliated with the organization. Even if it were shown that interveners in fact represented the interests of these \nresidents, such representation would extend to less than 20 percent of the class. Moreover, membership or affiliation with \nCASH/PRC does not equal agreement with CASH/PRC’s position in this litigation.14 Additionally, while the Lanterman Act \ndoes demonstrate an intent to include family members and conservators in the decision-making process affecting persons \nwith disabilities (see §§ 4502.1, 4500.5), it provides them scant concrete rights.15 (See §§ 4505, 4514.5, 4508.) Indeed, under \nthe Lanterman Act it is the individual with a developmental disability—not his or her family, friends, or conservator—who is \nafforded all the legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions. ( § 4502.) No \nmatter how well intentioned parents and conservators may be, they cannot exert their influence to curtail or deny the due \nprocess rights of persons with developmental disabilities. (See In re Hop (1981) 29 Cal.3d 82, 93-94.) \n  \nMore to the point of the adequacy analysis, the liability question posed by this lawsuit is whether defendants’ policies and \npractices comply with the law with respect to assessments, the IPP process and the array of services and placements available \nto  afford  community  placement  and  services  where  appropriate.  Interveners  have  registered  their  disagreement  with \nappellants’ view that certain policies and practices of defendants are unlawful, but this concern goes to the merits of \nappellants’ claim, not to the issue of certification. In other words, this disagreement does not comprise antagonism that will \ndefeat certification. Interveners have no legitimate interest, and thus can register no legitimate opposition, to a legal effort to \nenforce the Lanterman Act, the ADA, etc. Interveners have no legitimate interest in furthering any continuing violations of \nthe law, or in preventing other class members from seeking systemic relief to correct any violations found by the court. \nWhether these laws have been violated is for the court to decide, with the help of interveners. As the court acknowledged, \ninterveners can protect their interests by presenting evidence and making arguments to the trier of fact. \n  \nIt is true, as the trial court articulated, that interveners and appellants have different philosophical perspectives on the issue of \ninstitutionalization.16 However, philosophical differences do not amount to legally cognizable antagonism in this case \nparticularly where, as here, in attempting to make a fool-proof case of antagonism, interveners have consistently overstated, \nmisstated and exaggerated appellants’ position and the relief sought. As a consequence, the trial court made erroneous \nassumptions about the heart of this litigation. \n  \nFor example, interveners asserted and continue to assert that appellants “seek to end all institutional care in California, and \nadvocate placement of all persons with developmental disabilities in small, community-based programs.” The referenced \npages  of  the  complaint  alleged  that  thousands  of  Californians  with  developmental  disabilities  are  unnecessarily \ninstitutionalized, but in no manner does the complaint assert that institutional care should be ended. And again, interveners \ninsisted below that appellants “seek to move nearly every individual currently living in a [developmental center] into a \ncommunity care facility” and repeat here that appellants have so stated their intention to do that. The pages interveners \nreference make it clear that the relief sought in this lawsuit would not dictate the outcome of the process for any individual \nclass member and spoke of avoiding unnecessary institutionalization, not of moving everyone to the community. \n  \nThe trial court perceived the differing philosophical perspectives as a chasm: On the one hand are the named plaintiffs who \nassert class members’ entitlement to live in the least restrictive environment appropriate to the circumstances, and take the \nposition that many will benefit from moving from large institutions to a community setting. On the other hand are interveners \nwho argue that for many the best services are available in institutions and community placement would be detrimental. These \ndiffering perspectives do not comprise a legal conflict because they are not categorical—rather, they represent “half-full” and \n“half-empty” variations on the theme of residential placement. As the trial court understood, both views share the common, \noverarching goal of ensuring the proper and thorough development of IPP’s and the availability of services to meet each class \nmember’s needs. There is no conflict between that overarching goal and the subject matter of this lawsuit, namely whether \nrespondents’ policies and practices violate legal mandates calling for placement options and support services in the least \nrestrictive environment commensurate with personal needs. \n10 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \n  \nIt appears that the trial court was particularly concerned with the reality that interveners could not opt out because the relief \nsought was systemwide injunctive relief which, if provided, everyone would have to live with. Interveners stress that more \ncohesiveness within a class is required when the remedy is limited to injunctive and declaratory relief, citing Barnes v. \nAmerica Tobacco Co. (3d Cir. 1998) 161 F.3d 127, 142-143. First, the plaintiffs in Barnes pursued certification of a medical \nmonitoring class under rule 23(b)(2); they did not pursue institutional reform. Second, what the court and interveners \noverlook is the fact that interveners, as well as the state actors and regional centers, would be part of the effort forging any \nsystemwide solution to any documented unlawful practices or policies. Differences among class members about the type of \nrelief sought and the outcome of the litigation can be accommodated by the trial judge whose job is to give the various class \ninterests the proper weight under the applicable substantive law. ( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.3d at p. \n473, citing Developments, supra, 89 Harv. L.Rev. at pp. 1490-1492.) In addition, we repeat that the subject matter of this \ncase and the reforms pursued are not about the actual outcomes of an individualized IPP process, including individualized \ndeterminations about placement. \n   \nD. Superior Means for Resolving the Litigation \n  \nFinally, consistent with the misunderstanding that marked its decision on commonality, the trial court ruled that the alleged \nwrongs could not readily be cured on a classwide basis and that the fair hearing procedure set forth at section 4701 et seq. an \nadequate substitute for resolving appellants’ claims. This ruling cannot stand. Nonetheless, respondents and interveners \ncontinue to cling to the notion that individual action will solve the core issues defined in this litigation. \n  \nRespondents and interveners are unable, or unwilling, to grasp the “big picture” nature of this litigation. Appellants’ position \nis this : Before the outcome of improved individualized assessment, services and community supports tailored to the unique \nneeds of each person with a developmental disability can be realized, the policies that undergird decisionmaking and \nallocation of resources must be changed. As we explain, the class action mechanism is the only alternative that can achieve \nthis end. \n  \nThe Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedures are designed generally to decide “all issues concerning the rights of persons \nwith developmental disabilities to receive services under [the Lanterman Act].” ( § 4706, subd. (a).) Any applicant for or \nrecipient of services, or his or her authorized representative, “who is dissatisfied with any decision or action of the service \nagency which he or she believes to be illegal, discriminatory, or not in the recipient’s or applicant’s best interest” is afforded \nthe opportunity for a statutory fair hearing. ( § 4710.5, subd. (a).) \n  \nAppellants have sought systemic mandamus, injunctive and declaratory relief—relief that the fair hearing process cannot \nprovide. By definition, design, structure and scope, the Lanterman Act fair hearing procedure is for individual adjudication of \nclaims and is thus unavailable for, and/or incapable of, delivering classwide systemic relief. No one disputes, for example, \nthat a hearing officer presiding over the fair hearing procedure adjudicates individual claims and grievances and cannot grant \nthe requested injunctive relief. Moreover, should an individual petition for writ of mandate on a test case basis, any resulting \nwrit would constitute an inadequate remedy because class members are not parties to an individual decree and could not \nenforce the writ by contempt or supplemental decree. ( Miller v. Woods (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 862, 872.) The class action \nmechanism thus is favorable in this instance because it affords finality of judgment binding on all parties and the \nenforceability of class judgments through contempt or supplemental decrees. \n  \nFurther, without class treatment there could be multiple actions that would burden the litigants and the courts with cumulative \nand excessive expenses, discovery efforts and evidence. We recognize that the devices of joinder, consolidation, intervention \nand the test case are available in the context of multiple litigation, and the Department specifically points out that putative \nclass members could intervene in a test case to ensure that a writ of mandate was properly enforced. First, the outcome of a \nmotion to intervene would not be a foregone conclusion. Second, these devices are insufficient to vindicate legal rights \nbecause their use is premised on a group of parties with the economic and general wherewithal, willingness and ability to \nlook after their own interests individually through individual suits. ( Rose v. City of Hayward (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 926, \n934-935.) \n  \nThe very nature of this class cries out for a class treatment and a systemic approach because the individuals whose rights \nallegedly have been violated are persons with cognitive or other severe disabilities, many without the resources to undertake \n11 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nthe complex and daunting task of suing the myriad agencies involved in the delivery of services. The reviewing court in \nReyes v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at page 1270, footnote 6, said it well: “‘It is well settled that class \nactions are an appropriate procedure in government benefit cases where statutes and policies are likely to have an impact \nupon a broad class of recipients… .’ [Citation.] [C]lass actions for injunctive or declaratory relief serve the additional \nobjectives particularly important in government benefits litigation, including institutional changes, ‘facilitating enforcement \nof a favorable judgment, and protecting the interests of affected class members from the burden of bringing individual actions \nto establish the applicability of a decision for their benefit. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” \n  \nIII. Disposition \nThe order denying class certification cannot stand because it was based on improper criteria and incorrect legal assumptions. \nHad the trial court properly analyzed appellants’ theory of recovery and approach, it would have found commonality. Had it \nunderstood the type of conflict that will defeat adequacy of representation, it would not have concluded that appellants failed \nto establish this element. And finally with these proper understandings it would have recognized that the class action was the \nonly way to resolve appellants’ claims. Therefore, we reverse the judgment and direct that the trial court certify the class. \nReardon, Acting P.

P...   \n \n \n2  Plaintiffs and appellants are 16 representative plaintiffs, two taxpayer plaintiffs and three organizational plaintiffs. State \n  defendants and respondents are the Department and its director, sued in his official capacity; the Health and Human \nServices Agency and its secretary, sued in her official capacity; the Department of Health Services and its director, sued in \nher official capacity; the Department of Finance and its acting director, sued in his official capacity; and the Department of \nMental Health. Regional Center defendants and respondents are the 21 regional centers in this state. \n \n3  The term ‘developmental disability’ refers to ‘a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, \n  continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual… . [T]his \nterm shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling \nconditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals \nwith mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.’ ( § 4512, \nsubd. (a).) \nNearly one-third of the developmentally disabled persons served in California have a diagnosis of two or more disabilities \nand approximately 10 percent are dually diagnosed with both a developmental disability and a mental health condition. \n \n4  The Department contracts with private nonprofit corporations to establish and operate regional centers. The nonprofit \n  corporations must meet governing board criteria that ensure a diverse and representative membership knowledgeable of, or \ninterested in, developmental disabilities. ( §§ 4621, 4622.) \n \n5  ‘Consumer’ is defined as ‘a person who has a disability that meets the definition of developmental disability … .’ ( § 4512, \n  subd. (d).) \n \n6  Under this definition, the term ‘institutions’ refers to public, licensed or certified facilities, including developmental \n  centers, as well as an array of other public and private facilities with a capacity of 16 or more persons. \n \n7  A person is ‘at risk’ of being institutionalized when ‘the regional center determines, or is informed by the consumer’s \n  parents, legal guardian, conservator, or authorized representative that the community placement of [the] consumer is at risk \nof failing, and that admittance to a state developmental center is a likelihood.’ ( § 4418.7, subd. (a).) As well, for purposes \nof the class definition, persons at risk of institutionalization also include those meeting the same criteria with respect to \nnondevelopmental center institutions. Finally, the class definition encompasses individuals who are released from a \ndevelopmental center for provisional placement for one year, as these individuals have an ‘automatic right of return’ to the \ndevelopmental center during that period. ( § 4508.) \n \n8  The causes of action are: (1) violation of Lanterman Act entitlement to noninstitutional community living arrangements \n  based on individual need; (2) deprivation of rights under state nondiscrimination laws (Gov. Code, § 11135; Welf. & Inst. \nCode, § 4502); (3) deprivation of rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.); (4) \nviolation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.); (5) violation of state constitutional rights; (6) \nviolation of federal constitutional rights; (7) violation of the Medicaid Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.); (8) unlawful and \nunfair business practices against regional center defendants; and (9) illegal expenditure of taxpayer money. \n \n9  The organizations are California Association of State Hospital/Parent Councils for the Retarded (CASH/PCR) and \n  California Association for the Retarded (CAR). CASH/PCR claims that of the approximately 3,120 residents in the \ndevelopmental centers, nearly half have a family member, friend or conservator who is affiliated with the organization. \n \n10  These wrongs, as set out by the court, were (1) failure to provide understandable information in the IPP process; (2) failure \n  to provide adequate assessments in the IPP process; (3) basing IPP recommendations on factors unrelated to the needs and \nchoices of the individuals concerned; (4) failure to provide timely services and supports; and (5) failure to provide \nadequate community resources. \n \n11  There, plaintiffs pursued a theory of systemic failure in their effort to structurally reform New Mexico’s system for \n  evaluating and treating children with developmental and mental disabilities who were in the state’s custody. Parting ways \nwith the Third Circuit’s decision in a similar case ( Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey (3rd Cir. 1994) 43 F.3d 48 ( Baby \n14 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl. L. P...   \n \n \nNeal)), the court upheld the refusal to certify a class because there was no single constitutional or statutory claim common \nto the named plaintiffs and putative class members. ( J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, supra, 186 F.3d at pp. 1288-1289.) \nBaby Neal was a federal class action in which the named plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against officials \nresponsible for operating Philadelphia’s child welfare system. Numerous federal and state statutory and constitutional \nviolations were alleged. The district court denied class certification under rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure (hereafter rule 23(b)(2)) because each plaintiff was faced with his or her individual circumstances and needs and \nthus the class could not complain about a single common injury ( Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 54). (Rule 23(b)(2) is a \nroute to certification where ‘the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole.’) Reversing, the circuit court explained that the differences in the factual background of each claim are unlikely to \naffect the outcome of the legal issue, especially ‘where plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief against a \ndefendant engaging in a common course of conduct toward them, and there is therefore no need for individualized \ndeterminations of the propriety of injunctive relief. [Citation.] Indeed, [rule 23](b)(2) classes have been certified in a \nlegion of civil rights cases where commonality findings were based primarily on the fact that defendant’s conduct is \ncentral to the claims of all class members irrespective of their individual circumstances and the disparate effects of the \nconduct.’ ( Baby Neal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 57.) With respect to the matter at hand, the court ruled: ‘Plaintiffs have alleged \nthat systemic failure causes the DHS to violate various mandates under federal statutory and constitutional provisions. \nBecause the children in the system are comparably subject to the injuries caused by this systemic failure, even if the extent \nof their individual injuries may be affected by their individual circumstances, the challenge to the system constituted a \nlegal claim applicable to the class as a whole. An order forcing the DHS to comply with their statutory and constitutional \nmandates would constitute relief generally applicable to the entire putative class.’ ( Id. at p. 64.) \nThe Ninth Circuit recently relied on Baby Neal in a California prisoners’ rights case under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act \nand Fourteenth Amendment, concluding that ‘commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide \npractice or policy that affects all of the putative class members. [Citations.] In such circumstance, individual factual \ndifferences among the individual litigants or groups of litigants will not preclude a finding of commonality. [(See Baby \nNeal, supra, 43 F.3d at p. 56).] Certainly the differences that exist here do not justify requiring groups of persons with \ndifferent disabilities, all of whom suffer similar harm from the Board’s failure to accommodate their disabilities, to \nprosecute separate actions.’ ( Armstrong v. Davis (9th Cir. 2001) 275 F.3d 849, 868.) \n \n12  In the absence of relevant state precedent, trial courts are urged to follow the procedures set forth in rule 23 of the Federal \n  Rules of Civil Procedure for conducting class actions. ( Green v. Obledo (1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 145-146.) As we have no \nspecific statutory provision detailing procedures for class plaintiffs pursuing only injunctive and declaratory relief, the trial \ncourt appropriately looked to rule 23(b)(2) for guidance. \n \n13  Reyes was cited with approval and relied on in Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pages 333, footnote 6, and 334. \n   \n14  In connection with its motion to intervene and opposition to appellants’ motion for class certification, CASH/PRC \n  submitted declarations, claiming that its members were in uniform opposition to (1) the claims and relief sought by \nappellants ‘at least where relatives and conservators of CASH/PCR members are concerned’ as well as (2) appellants’ \nattempt to certify a class. Appellants correctly objected to these statements, inserting hearsay, foundational, relevancy and \ninadmissible opinion objections, but the trial court never ruled on the objections. \n \n15  Their consent is required for electoconvulsive therapy or behavior modification ( § 4505) as well as provisional placement \n  in a regional center ( § 4508). Additionally, pursuant to section 4514.5, family members are entitled to certain information \nabout a resident’s status. \n \n16  Respondents and interveners also make much of the fact that in opposing intervention, appellants stated that the interests \n  of the organizational and parent representatives ‘are potentially and actually in conflict with the interests of the plaintiffs \nand the putative plaintiff class.’ Thereafter ensued a discussion of federal and state case law concerning actual and \npotential conflicts of interests that courts have articulated as existing between institutionalized individuals and family \nmembers. To be clear, appellants addressed conflict between the parent and organizational interveners and the putative \nclass. Appellants did not assert any interest that conflicted with interveners who are actual putative class members. \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n15 \n \n\n¶ 148,454 CAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST ET AL., PLAINTIFFS..., Labor & Empl.

Plaintiffs do not have a constitutional right to residential services in the community, state defendants \nhave not violated their rights to free expression and association by providing services to them in the developmental centers as \nopposed to in small community settings. And, plaintiffs have failed to even identify a similarly situated group let alone show \nthat they are receiving unequal treatment as compared to such a group in violation of equal protection. \n  \nMoreover, all of plaintiffs’ complaints can be adequately addressed under the other causes of action alleged. The Lanterman \nAct sets forth California’s comprehensive scheme for providing services and supports for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities, and plaintiffs have alleged several violations under the Act that mirror their allegations of constitutional \nviolations. Additionally, they have stated causes of action under the American with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the \nMedicaid Act regarding the same allegations they assert under the constitutional provisions. In sum, plaintiffs have not \nsufficiently  alleged  facts  which  establish  that  state  defendants  have  violated  any  provision  of  either  the  California \nConstitution or the U.S. Constitution. Accordingly, state defendants’ demurrers to the fifth and sixth causes of action must be \nsustained. Moreover, the State of California is not a proper party against which injunctive relief can be sought, and therefore, \nthe demurrer as to the State as a defendant must be sustained. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF PERTINENT FACTS \nIn alleging that all defendants - state defendants and regional center defendants - have violated their rights under Article 1, \nsections 1 and 7(a) of the California Constitution, plaintiffs state: “Defendants’ policies and practices which are challenged in \nthis action have resulted and will result in the indefinite and inappropriate institutionalization of plaintiffs and class \nmembers.” (Complaint, ¶ 254.) They specifically contend that they have personal liberty interests protected under Article 1, \nsection 1 which include “a fundamental interest in habilitation - that is, the right to achieve one’s maximum potential”; that \n“[t]he State must provide treatment and services in a manner which least drastically curtails the freedom of the individual; \nthat “[inappropriate institutionalization constitutes a form of physical restraint...”; that “[inappropriate confinement in public \nand private institutions infringes on plaintiffs’ and class members’ fundamental freedom to associate by preventing them \nfrom living in the community.”; and that “[t]he unnecessary and inappropriate segregation in public and private institutions of \npersons with developmental disabilities... whose needs could be met in less restrictive placements in the community” violates \nthe equal protection under section 7(a) of Article 1. (Complaint, ¶ 254(a-e).) \n  \n3 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820000...   \n \n \nWith regard to their claims that defendants have violated their rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th \nAmendment as well as their right to freedom of expression and association under the 1st Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution, plaintiffs allege that they “have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in receiving minimally adequate or \nreasonable care and services and in being free from undue restraint, including the right to be free of confinement in an \ninstitution, when professional judgment recommends that institutionalization is not necessary.” (Complaint, ¶ 257.) They \nspecifically claim that defendants deprive them of their fundamental liberty interests in that they “have been denied \nminimally adequate habilitation and/or been subject to undue restraint by being confined in institutional settings when they \ncould  live  successfully  in  small  integrated  community  homes;”  that  many  plaintiffs  and  class  members  “remain \ninstitutionalized due to the lack of adequate community resources which can meet their individual needs”; that the failure of \nregional  center  professionals  or  Individual  Program  Plan  (“IPP”)  teams  have  substantially  departed  from  accepted \nprofessional judgment standards where they have failed to recommend plaintiffs or class members be placed in the \ncommunity; and that defendants have violated the injunction in Richard Set al. v. DDS where they have failed to recommend \ncommunity placement based on family objections. (Complaint, ¶ 258 (a)-(d).) \n  \nPlaintiffs have also alleged that defendants have violated their freedoms of expression and association under the 1 st \nAmendment “by preventing them from living in the community, thereby restricting their ability to participate in community \nactivities and associate with non-disabled members of the community including family and friends.” (Complaint, ¶ 259.) \nAnd, they allege that defendants have violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment “by establishing, \nencouraging and otherwise sanctioning programs, policies and practices that.have excluded, separated and segregated people \nwith developmental disabilities from society without any rational basis.” (Complaint ¶ 260.) \n  \nARGUMENT \n.I. \nPLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGE FACTS THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THAT STATE \nDEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED ARTICLE 1, SECTIONS 1 AND 7(A) UNDER THE CALIFORNIA \nCONSTITUTION. \nA. Plaintiffs Have Failed To Sufficiently Allege Facts That Establish State Defendants Have Violated Article 1, Section \n1. \nArticle 1, section 1 provides: \nAll people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and \nliberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness and privacy. \n  \nPlaintiffs allege that this provision of the California Constitution guarantees them a \n  \n  \n“fundamental interest in habilitation- that is, the right to achieve one’s maximum potential.” (Complaint, ¶ 254.) However, \nwhat plaintiffs truly seek is to impose a mandatory duty on state defendants to provide them with opportunities to achieve \ntheir maximum potential. This is evident from the relief requested which includes ordering state defendants to “[d]evelop, \nexpand, and make available with dispatch a sufficient array of integrated, stable quality community living arrangements....” \n(Complaint, Relief Requested, 13(i).) Plaintiffs would also require state defendants to “[m]ake available a friend-advocate to \neach plaintiff and member of the plaintiff class to assist each in securing the substantive and procedural protections \naforesaid....” (Complaint, Relief Requested, 13 (v).) \n  \nHowever, there is no affirmative duty on state defendants to provide for “liberty,” “safety,” “happiness” or “privacy”; only \nthat they not interfere with a citizen’s right to exercise their rights. (See, e.g., Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School \nDistrict (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 1224, 1238.). \n  \n4 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820000...   \n \n \nIn Clausing, the plaintiff, a developmentally and physically disabled student, brought a class action against teachers, the \nschool district, and the local board of education, alleging that the teacher repeatedly subjected plaintiff and those like him to \nphysical, psychological, verbal abuse, beatings and public humiliation. Plaintiff further alleged that the school district \nauthorized or failed to prevent the abuse by the teacher. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that Article 1, section 1 of the \nCalifornia Constitution, prohibited defendants from carrying out a “policy” which allegedly authorized teachers in the district \nto humiliate students by depriving them of their right of privacy. (Id.) The Court of Appeals in upholding the trial court’s \nsustaining of the defendants’ demurrer stated: \nAlthough citizens have a private cause of action against public entities for violation of the right to privacy, no case has ever \nheld that California Constitution, article 1, section 1, imposes a mandatory duty on public entities to protect a citizen’s right \nto privacy. The constitutional mandate is simply that the government is prohibited from violating the right.... \n  \n  \n(Id. (emphasis in original).) \n  \nAccordingly, given that California courts have never interpreted Article 1, section 1, to impose a mandatory duty on public \nentities to protect a citizen’s right to privacy, plaintiffs cannot state any facts that would support a violation of Article 1, \nsection 1. Therefore, state defendants’ demurrer to plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action with regard to the violation of Article 1, \nsection 1 must be sustained without leave to amend. \n  \nB. Plaintiffs Have Failed To Sufficiently Allege Facts That Establish That State Defendants Have Violated The Due \nProcess Clause Under Article I, Section 7(a). \nPlaintiffs further allege in the fifth cause of action that defendants have violated their rights pursuant to Article 1, section 7(a) \nof the California Constitution. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that “inappropriate institutionalization constitutes a form of \nphysical restraint and violates the guarantees of Article 1, section 1 and section 7(a) which establish substantive and \nprocedural  protections  against  unreasonable  bodily  restraint.”  (Complaint,  ¶  254.)  Plaintiffs  also  allege  that  “[t]he \nunnecessary and inappropriate segregation in public and private institutions of persons with developmental disabilities, \nincluding plaintiffs and class members, whose needs could be met in less restrictive placements in the community, denies \nthese individuals equal protection under the laws in violation of Art.l §7(a).” (Id.) Article 1, section 7(a) of the California \nConstitution provides in pertinent part: \nA person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without the due process of law or denied equal protection of the \nlaws;.... \n  \n  \nIn order to determine whether a person’s due process right has been violated, the California Supreme Court has held that four \nfactors must be considered. The factors are: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of \nan erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probative value, if any, of additional or \nsubstitute procedural safeguards, (3) the dignitary interest in informing individuals of the nature, grounds and consequences \nof the action and enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible governmental official, and (4) the \ngovernmental interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail. (People v. Ramirez (1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 269; see also Rains v. Belshe \n(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 157, 178; Cramer v. Gillermina R. (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 380, 388.) \n  \nHere, plaintiffs have alleged merely that [i]nappropriate institutionalization constitutes a form of physical restraint....” \nHowever, plaintiffs fail to allege any facts with regard to the other three Ramirez factors to show how the State’s procedures \nare insufficient to protect their due process rights. Accordingly, as plaintiffs have failed to properly plead a violation of due \nprocess based on their placement in developmental centers or large community-based facilities, or with respect to undue \nrestraint, state defendants’ demurrer to the fifth cause of action with regard to due process violation must be sustained \nwithout leave to amend, \n  \nC. Plaintiffs Have Not Allege Sufficient Facts To Establish That State Defendants Have Violated The Equal Protection \n5 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820000...   \n \n \nClause. \n“The first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a \nclassification affecting two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.” (Cramer, 125 Cal, App. 3d at 387, \nciting In re Eric J. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530.) “A classification ‘must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some \nground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly \ncircumstanced shall be treated alike.” (Cramer, 125 Cal.App, 3d at 387, citing Reed v. Reed (1971) 404 U.S. 71,76.) Here, \nplaintiffs have failed to allege that the state has adopted a classification affecting two or more similarly situated groups in an \nunequal manner. \n  \nTherefore, as plaintiffs fail to properly allege the basic elements required to prove a violation of equal protection under the \nCalifornia Constitution, state defendants demurrer to the equal protection portion of the fifth cause of action must be \nsustained without leave to amend. \n  \nII. \nPLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGE FACTS THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THAT STATE \nDEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS UNDER THE 1ST AND 14THY AMENDMENTS OF \nTHE U.S. CONSTITUTION. \nA. Plaintiffs Have Failed To Allege Sufficient Facts To Show That State Defendants Have Violated The Due Process \nClause Of The 14th Amendment. \n“The Due Process Clause contains a substantive component that bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions \n‘regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them,”’ Foucha v. Louisiana (1992) 504 U.S. 71, 80. “The \ntouchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government.” (County of Sacramento v. \nLewis (1998) 523 U.S. 833, 845.) Where the plaintiff challenges the actions of a government executive, “only the most \negregious official conduct can be said to be ‘arbitrary’ in the constitutional sense.” (Id. at 846.) Mere negligence is never \nsufficient for substantive due process liability. (See Daniels v. Williams (1986) 474 U.S. 327.) Under Lewis, substantive due \nprocess liability attaches only to executive action that is “so ill-conceived or malicious that it ‘shocks the conscience.”’ ( \nMiller v. City of Philadelphia (3d Cir. 1999) 174 F.3d 368,375, quoting Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846.) “The exact degree of \nwrongfulness necessary to reach the ‘conscience-shocking’ level depends upon the circumstances of a particular case.” \n(Miller, 174 F.3d at 375.) \n  \nIn Youngbergv. Romeo (1982) 457 U.S. 307, 315-22, the Supreme Court concluded that substantive due process under the \nFourteenth  Amendment  imposes  duties  on  states  concerning  the  care  and  training  they  are  obligated  to  provide \ninstitutionalized individuals under their care. The states are obligated under the Due Process Clause to provide safe living \nconditions, freedom from bodily restraint, and minimally adequate training. (Id. at 319-320.) The duty to train is limited to \nsuch training as “an appropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure [an individual’s] safety and to facilitate his \nability to function free from bodily restraints.” (Id. at 324.) Finally, the Supreme Court established in Youngberg that the \nstates are required to make certain that professional judgment is being exercised in making those decisions concerning the \ncare and training of institutionalized individuals. (Id. at 321.) \n  \nThe plaintiff in Youngberg was a profoundly retarded man with an IQ of between eight and ten who had been committed to a \nstate hospital after his mother could no longer care for him. (Id at 309.) While in the state hospital, Romeo suffered numerous \ninjuries, some self-inflicted and some inflicted by other residents. (Id. at 310). Romeo’s mother brought a section 1983 action \non his behalf, alleging that hospital officials knew that Romeo was being injured but failed to institute appropriate \npreventative measures, that the defendants improperly restrained Romeo for prolonged periods, and that the defendants were \nnot providing Romeo with appropriate treatment or training for his mental retardation. (Id. at 311.) \n  \nThe Third Circuit ruled that the jury instructions failed to properly define the scope of Romeo’s constitutional rights and held \nthat the standards were couched in terms of “compelling necessity,” “substantial necessity,” and “least intrusive alternative.” \n6 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820000...   \n \n \nThe Supreme Court found that the standards articulated by the Third Circuit majority imposed too great a burden on the state. \n(Id. at 321-22.) The Court concluded that “the Constitution only requires that the courts make certain that professional \njudgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable \nchoices should have been made.” (Id.) The Court emphasized that a decision, “if made by a professional, is presumptively \nvalid; liability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision \non such a judgment.” (Id. at 323.)1 \n  \nIn this action, plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated their right to substantive due process by denying them \n“minimally adequate habilitation” or subjecting them to “undue restraint” because defendants have confined them to \ninstitutional settings “when they could live successfully in small integrated community homes.” (Complaint, ¶ 258(a).) \nAlleging that “community services provide a better quality of life,” plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that the federal constitution \nincorporates a “fundamental liberty interest in being able to move into the community” and guarantees the plaintiffs a right to \n“seek their release from institutions without arbitrary procedures.” (Complaint ¶¶ 154-163,257.) However, plaintiffs do not \nhave a constitutional right to have the state provide services to them in the community. At most, they have a substantive right \nto safety and minimal training to ensure undue bodily restraint in the institution. Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to \nsupport a cause of action for violation of substantive due process under the 14th Amendment. \n  \nB. Plaintiffs Have Failed To Allege Sufficient Facts That State Defendants Have Violated Their 1st Amendment \nRights To Freedom Of Expression And Association. \nThere are two forms of constitutionally protected “freedom of association.” Under one, the Court has recognized “choices to \nenter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the State because of \nthe role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme.” (Roberts v. \nUnited States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.) Under the other, “the Court has recognized a right to associate for the \npurpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment - speech, assembly, petition for the redress of \ngrievances, and the exercise of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association of this kind as an indispensable \nmeans of preserving other individual liberties.” (Id. at 618.) \n  \n“The Court has long recognized that, because the Bill of Rights is designed to secure individual liberty, it must afford the \nformation and preservation of certain kinds of highly personal relationships a substantial measure of sanctuary from \nunjustified interference by the State.” (Id, at 618 (citations omitted).) Only close personal relationships such as with family \nare protected. (Id. at 619-20; see also Freeman v. City of Santa Ana (9th Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 1180, 1887 (customers of a bar \nnot close personal relationship).) \n  \nIn this action, plaintiffs have alleged that “[d]efendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and class members to the \nfreedoms of expression and association by the First Amendment by preventing them from living in the community, thereby \nrestricting their ability to participate in community activities and associate with non-disabled members of the community \nincluding family and friends.” (Complaint ¶ 259.) First, they have no 1st Amendment right of association with members of \nthe general public. Second, they have failed to allege any facts that show that state defendants are precluding them from \nmaintaining  close  relationships  with  family  and  friends.  Simply  alleging  that  it  would  be  easier  to  maintain  those \nrelationships if they lived in a small community-based setting is not enough. Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to \nmaintain a cause of action for violation of the 1st Amendment right of association. \n  \nC. Plaintiffs Have Failed To Allege Sufficient Facts To Establish That State Defendants Have Violated Their Rights \nUnder The Equal Protection Clause Of The 14th Amendment. \n“The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment commands that no State shall ‘deny to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws,’ which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” \n(City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 439, citing Plyler v. Doe (1982) 457 U.S. 202, 216. “The \n7 \n \n\nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820000...   \n \n \nfirst step in equal protection analysis is to identify the [defendants’] classification of groups.”’ (Freeman at 1187 (citation \nomitted).) “To accomplish this, a plaintiff can show that the law is applied in a discriminatory manner or imposes different \nburdens on different classes of people.” (Id. (citation omitted).) “Once the plaintiff establishes governmental classification, it \nis necessary to identify a ‘similarly situated’ class against which the plaintiff’s class can be compared.” (Id., citing Attorney \nGeneral v. Irish People, Inc. (D.C. Cir. 1982) 684 F.2d 928, 946 (“Discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum; it can be found \nonly in the unequal treatment of people in similar circumstances”).) \n  \nHere, plaintiffs have not alleged a class of persons to which they are similarly situated. In fact, they merely allege that \n“[djefendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and class members secured by the Equal Protection Clause... by \nestablishing, encouraging and otherwise sanctioning programs, policies and practices that have excluded, separated and \nsegregated people with developmental disabilities from society without any rational basis.” (Complaint § 260.) In other \nwords, they allege discrimination in a vacuum; they have not even identified a similarly situated group. Thus, plaintiffs have \nnot alleged sufficient facts to establish that state defendants have violated their right to equal protection under the 14th \nAmendment. \n  \nIII. \nTHE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT A PROPER PARTY AGAINST WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED. \nPlaintiffs sue “the State of California” as a defendant in the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth causes of \naction in plaintiffs’ complaint. In cases for declaratory and injunctive relief the “State” as opposed to an agency or officer is \nnot a proper party against which relief may be granted. State v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal.Sd 237, 255. In State, plaintiffs \napplied for a permit from the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission (“Commission”) to develop land within the \ncoastal zone. The Commission denied their permit and plaintiffs filed a petition in the superior court for a writ of mandamus \nand other relief against the State of California, the Commission, its members and two Commission employees. The \nCommission demurred to the petition on a variety of grounds including that the State of California was mis-joined as a \ndefendant and that the petition failed to state a cause of action as to the State with respect to some of the causes of action. The \nCalifornia Supreme Court sustained defendant’s demurrers challenging the State of California as a defendant. The Court held \nthat only the Commission could grant the relief requested, which was to set aside its decision, and therefore the State was not \na proper defendant. (Id.) The Court next sustained demurrers to the fourth and fifth causes of action because they did not \ncontain allegations that established any right to declaratory relief against the State, finding that the only declaratory relief \navailable was against the Commission acting as the agent of the State. (Id.) In the instant case, the plaintiffs seek declaratory \nrelief against the State of California, which may only be granted by an agent of the State and not by the State itself. \nAccordingly, state defendants respectfully request that this Court sustain a demurrer to the State of California as a defendant \nin the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth causes of action as it is not a proper party in this matter. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nFor all the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to establish violations under Article 1, sections 1 \nand 7(a) under the California Constitution or under the 1st and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, state \ndefendants’ demurrers to the fifth and sixth causes of action must be sustained without leave to amend. Additionally, as the \nState of California is not a proper party against which relief may be granted, the demurrer to the State of California as a \ndefendant in the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action must also be sustained without leave to \namend. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  .

Thousands of Californians with developmental disabilities are needlessly isolated and \n4  segregated from mainstream society in large congregate public and private institutions.  Every year \n5  hundreds more find themselves at risk of institutionalization due to the lack of appropriate \n6  community supports and crisis intervention.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to restore their legal rights \n7  to freedom from such institutionalization and to live, with appropriate supports, in our \n8  neighborhoods. \n9  2.  The current circumstances violate Federal and State law.  In the Lanterman \n10  Developmental Disabilities Services Act (“Lanterman Act”), for example, California created an \n11  entitlement for people with developmental disabilities to an array of services and supports \n12  sufficiently complete to meet their needs and choices, to support their integr ation into the \n13  mainstream life of the community and to enable them to approximate the pattern of everyday living \n14  available to people without disabilities.  Ass’n for Retarded Citizens – Cal. v. DDS, 38 Cal.3d 384 \n15  (1984).  In order to fulfill its mandate, t he State established 21 local non-profit regional centers \n16  which are obligated to prepare individual program plans jointly with each person and develop the \n17  needed service resources under the supervision of, and with funding from, the Department of \n18  Developmental Services (DDS).  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4500, et seq.  Despite this mandate, thousands \n19  of people with developmental disabilities are unnecessarily institutionalized because the State and \n20  the regional centers have failed in their obligation under the Lanterman Act to develop and provide \n21  community-based alternatives. \n22  3.  In 1990, President Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \n23  establishing one of the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities in our nation’s \n24  history.  42 U.S.C. § 12100, et seq.  In enacting the ADA, Congress found that “historically, society \n25  has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such forms of \n26  discrimination ... continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(z).  \n27  The United States Supreme Court held that, under the ADA, unnecessary institutionalization is \n28  discrimination based on disability and required that States take actions to ensure that people with \n \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n1 \n \n\n \n1  disabilities who can be served in integrated, non-isolated settings are actually served in such settings.  \n2  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  It is over two years since the  Olmstead decision was issued, \n3  yet, in violation of the ADA, California has failed to take adequate steps to red uce the unnecessary \n4  institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities at a reasonable pace. \n5  4.  Unnecessary segregation also contravenes other State and Federal statutory rights as \n6  well as fundamental constitutional rights, including the rights to liberty, privacy and freedom of \n7  association. \n8  5.  In spite of these rights and obligations, state and regional center defendants do not do \n9  adequate assessments of individuals’ ability to benefit from community living, do not do adequate \n10  program planning, and, therefore, do not develop sufficient quality programs to meet the needs of \n11  people with developmental disabilities.  Because of defendants’ policies and practices, and because \n12  California continues to under-fund its community service system, there is a continuing shortage of \n13  stable, quality community living arrangements and ancillary supports that would enable people with \n14  developmental disabilities to achieve their potential for independence and integration into the \n15  community.   The further and inevitable res ult of defendants’ conduct is the continued unnecessary \n16  institutionalization of thousands of people with developmental disabilities. \n17  6.  By this action, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class they represent, on \n18  behalf of their organizations and members, on behalf of the general public, or as taxpayers, seek to \n19  enforce those statutory and constitutional rights that guarantee that people with developmental \n20  disabilities have the choice and opportunity to live as part of, rather than apart from, our \n21  neighborhoods and communities. \n22  7.  Plaintiffs’ needs are urgent.  The time they spend waiting for appropriate community \n23  living arrangements represents an irretrievable loss – it is time which could and should be used to \n24  acquire skills and develop independence in community settings and participate as members of their \n25  communities. \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 2 \n \n\n \n1  II. \n2  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3  8.  Jurisdiction of this Court is conferred, pursuant to the California Constitution Article 6 \n4  section 10, because plaintiffs seek equitable relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 526, \n5  527 and 1085.  Venue in the Superior Court for Alameda County is appropriate pursuant to Code of \n6  Civil Procedure sections 395(A) and 395.5 in that this is an action in which defendants reside  in \n7  different counties, including Alameda, and in which defendants’ breaches of their obligations \n8  occurred in different counties, including Alameda.  Venue is also appropriate under Code of Civil \n9  Procedure section 401(1) in that this is an action against the State and its Departments and such \n10  action may be commenced in any county, including Alameda, where the Attorney General has an \n11  office. \n12  III. \n13  PARTIES \n14  Representative Petitioners/Plaintiffs \n15    Adolph Angulo \n16  9.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Adolph Angulo is a 45-year-old man who is a client of Tri-\n17  Counties Regional Center (TCRC).  He has resided in various large private and public institutional \n18  settings for most of his life because defendants failed to locate or develop the community supports \n19  he needed.  Due to his disabilities, including profound retardation, Down’s Syndrome, and diabetes, \n20  Mr. Angulo requires staff assistance with personal hygiene and all activities of daily living.  He is \n21  able to distinguish what he likes and dislikes.  If made to do something he does not like, he resists \n22  and voices his displeasure.  He responds to things he likes by smiling and laughing and is able to \n23  follow basic instructions and respond to requests.  Mr. Angulo appears in this action through his \n24  guardian ad litem, Janice Vogliardo.   \n25  10.  In October 1999, Mr. Angulo finally moved to a 6-bed community home, but shortly \n26  thereafter he was hospitalized, determined to have diabetes, and developed aspiration pneumonia.  \n27  Consequently, he was placed on a ventilator and a gastronomy tube was inserted.  TCRC sought to \n28  place him at Lanterman Developmental Center (DC), but, with assistance from the Lanterman \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 3 \n \n\n \n1  Regional Project, he was deflected to another 6-bed home.  Mr. Angulo did well at this home, \n2  however, in a few months he developed further respiratory issues which resulted in a tracheostomy \n3  tube being inserted.   \n4  11.  Mr. Angulo was not able to return to his prior home, although they wanted him to, \n5  because they were not licensed to do tracheostomy care.  Thus, in April 2000, Mr. Angulo was \n6  admitted to Lanterman DC where he remains today.  At Lanterman, Mr. Angulo suffered a fall while \n7  unsupervised which resulted in the loss of two teeth.  \n8  12.  The Los Angeles County Superior Court has held hearings on Mr. Angulo’s status \n9  almost every month.  Court orders require TCRC to report regularly on Mr. Angulo’s “placement \n10  status.”  TCRC’s plan was to wait for Mr. Angulo to be weaned from his tracheostomy tube so he \n11  could return to his prior home.  However, no efforts were made to locate or develop providers who, \n12  with appropriate funding and supports, would be willing and able to handle his present combination \n13  of medical and behavioral needs.  In fact, community services can and should be provided  to people \n14  with these conditions. \n15  13.  One and a half years later, treatment has not resulted in Mr. Angulo being weaned \n16  from the tracheostomy tube, and he remains in the DC only because the system has failed to provide \n17  him with community care that can meet his unique needs. \n18  Harry Asprey \n19  14.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Harry Asprey is a 49-year-old man who has resided at Porterville \n20  DC for 42 years and is a client of Central Valley Regional Center.  Mr. Asprey has profound \n21  retardation, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and is becoming blind.  Moving to the community has \n22  never been attempted or considered for Mr. Asprey, although he is cooperative and does not require \n23  extraordinary services.  Mr. Asprey was originally placed in the DC by his parents at age seven.  His \n24  placement has never been reviewed by a court.  Mr. Asprey appears in this action through his \n25  guardian ad litem, Tolley Gorham. \n26  15.  Mr. Asprey’s verbal communication is limited, but he interacts with staff by \n27  mimicking them, smiling, or reaching out to touch their hands.   Mr. Asprey shows dislike of an \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 4 \n \n\n \n1  activity by frowning, pulling away, or standing and pacing in a circle.  Mr. Asprey works well with \n2  staff.  He requires assistance with activities of daily living.  \n3  16.  When very frustrated, Mr. Asprey sometimes engages in self-injurious behaviors such \n4  as slapping himself or biting his upper arms.  This happens most frequently when he is interrupted in \n5  the middle of performing a compulsive ritual, is in a crowded or noisy situation, or finds another \n6  client occupying his preferred seat.  Each of these antecedents would be mitigated in a family -scale \n7  community home where he could receive more individualized attention.   \n8  17.  Mr. Asprey’s most recent Individual Program Plan (IPP), dated March 2001, lists the \n9  services that he would require were he to live in the community.  Primarily, these are a home suited \n10  for the blind with four or fewer residents, 24-hour awake-staff, and specialists he could see for his \n11  medical and behavioral issues.  The inclusion of these services in Mr. Asprey’s IPP  acknowledges \n12  the feasibility of living in the community for him.  Yet, while these services are fairly readily \n13  available, Mr. Asprey is not considered “recommended for community placement” and there are no \n14  plans to assist him to move.  In fact, Mr. Asprey’s Central Valley Regional Center service \n15  coordinator did not even attend his last annual IPP meeting.  \n16    Edson Cruz \n17  18.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Edson Cruz is a 17 year-old man who has resided at Fairview \n18  Developmental Center since March 2001 and is a client of Central Valley Regional Center (CVRC).  \n19  Mr. Cruz is profoundly retarded, has attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autistic with severely \n20  challenging behaviors.  His maladaptive behaviors include shredding fabrics, grabbing others, and \n21  resisting by dropping to the ground and refusing to get back up.   Mr. Cruz appears in this action \n22  through his guardian ad litem and father, Juan Cruz.   \n23  19.  Mr. Cruz is nonverbal but will respond to attention and affection with smiles, hand \n24  clapping and eye contact.  Mr. Cruz requires assistance with most activities of daily living and all \n25  self-care needs.  Mr. Cruz is able to complete simple chores when asked to do so and is especially \n26  good at weeding.  He likes to be outdoors playing ball, swimming, and taking long walks.  \n27  20.  For most of his life, Mr. Cruz lived with his mother in a monolingual Spanish speaking \n28  household.  As he became older and stronger at 15 years old, Mr. Cruz’s challenging behaviors \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 5 \n \n\n \n1  increased and his needs exceeded his mother’s ability to provide for him.  CVRC  did not have an \n2  available home for minors with his behaviors and sought to commit him to Fairview DC.  With the \n3  assistance of the regional project, Mr. Cruz was deflected to the crisis home for children which has \n4  only two residents, 2:1 staffing during the day and professional support to address behavioral \n5  challenges.  Minors usually live at the home for 3 months during which time the regional center is \n6  expected to develop a community home and the individual’s behavior can be stabilized.  \n7  21.  Mr. Cruz lived at Central Valley Crisis House for approximately six months.   Mr. Cruz \n8  did well at the crisis home, and his behavior progressed.   Although he still made some attempts at \n9  aggression and property destruction, staff found that he responded to them when they se t limits.  \n10  Once Mr. Cruz learned how to communicate his needs effectively, his behavioral problems began to \n11  decrease in frequency.  During this time, he also attended school four hours per day.   \n12  22.  As they are intended for short term stays, Mr. Cruz could no  longer remain in the crisis \n13  home.  In the discharge summary, the crisis home stated “Edson displays the potential for being able \n14  to function in a less restrictive environment than a DC.”  CVRC had failed, however, to develop a \n15  similar permanent home or provide additional 1:1 staffing and clinical supports to a current provider.  \n16  Mr. Cruz was thus forced to go to Fairview DC far from his family who cannot visit him.  \n17  Furthermore, he could not be served on the unit where other minors at Fairview reside.  Inst ead, he \n18  was placed on an adult unit where he does not have an appropriate peer group.  \n19  23.  Mr. Cruz has inappropriately been institutionalized at Fairview solely because CVRC \n20  has not located or developed a community home, similar to the crisis house, where he c ould \n21  successfully live.  His parents clearly wish for him to be close to them.  Yet, Mr. Cruz remains at \n22  Fairview DC, very far from his parents in Fresno and with non -Spanish speaking adults. \n23  David Kelty \n24  24.  Plaintiff/Petitioner David Kelty is a 36-year-old man who currently resides at Casa \n25  Carmen, a private, 110 bed institution licensed as a community care facility.  Mr. Kelty is a client of \n26  Inland Regional Center.  Mr. Kelty has mild retardation, full autistic syndrome, and a history of \n27  seizures which have been controlled by medication.  Mr. Kelty appears in this action through his \n28  mother and guardian ad litem, Roberta Kelty.   \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 6 \n \n\n \n1  25.  Mr. Kelty is social and has a great memory.  He appears to remember everyone he \n2  meets and directions to every place that he has ever be en.  He is able to prepare simple meals on his \n3  own using the stove and microwave.  Mr. Kelty is literate and likes to watch programs on C -SPAN.  \n4  He enjoys traveling and spends time at the local library.   \n5  26.  Mr. Kelty had his own home, with supports, for almos t two years until his apartment \n6  was broken into and vandalized.  Unfortunately, Inland Regional Center and Mr. Kelty’s supported \n7  living provider failed to repair this damage and was evicted.  Consequently, he began bouncing \n8  between his mother’s home and se veral other facilities until finally landing at Mountain View Manor \n9  for approximately two years.  When this institution closed in 2000, Mr. Kelty moved to Casa \n10  Carmen.  \n11  27.  Mr. Kelty has lived independently in the past and has clearly expressed a desire to liv e \n12  on his own again.  Yet, Inland Regional Center is not currently working on plans for Mr. Kelty to \n13  return to a supported living situation and he remains needlessly institutionalized.  \n14    Kimberly McAnnelly \n15  28.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Kimberly McAnnelly is a 26-year-old woman who has resided at \n16  Sonoma DC since 1998 and is a client of North Bay Regional Center.  Ms. McAnnelly is dually \n17  diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and mild retardation.  Since the age of 5, she has been \n18  in a series of state hospitals  for the mentally ill and/or developmental disabilities and has spent time \n19  in McClaren Children’s Center.  Ms. McAnnelly appears in this action through her guardian ad \n20  litem, Edwina Taylor. \n21  29.  Ms. McAnnelly is social and easily engages in conversation.  She willingly \n22  participates in many different activities.  Ms. McAnnelly is able to make choices for herself and \n23  communicate her needs and desires appropriately.  She is developing a sense of care for others and \n24  enjoys being helpful.  She exercises independence to the degree that she can within Sonoma DC and \n25  would like to live in a community setting closer to her family.  She keeps in consistent contact with \n26  her family and friends through phone calls and letters. \n27  30.  When Ms. McAnnelly is disappointed or upset, she ma y exhibit aggressive behavior \n28  toward others, as well as harmful behavior to herself.  Her program at Sonoma DC inadvertently \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 7 \n \n\n \n1  encourages these behaviors.  She has no peers on her residence because Sonoma DC does not have a \n2  unit for those who are dually diagnosed.  Most of her behavioral problems occur at the end of \n3  activities, when she is faced with returning to her unit, or within a short time after she has returned to \n4  her unit.  She is on a Step program, which denies her privileges if she is not reaching h er goals.  Ms. \n5  McAnnelly is told that she must meet many requirements in her training program before she can be \n6  considered for placement.  When she witnesses others advancing in levels while she remains unable \n7  to move toward community living, she both lashes out at them and abuses herself.  \n8  31.  Ms. McAnnelly has never been appropriately assessed and considered for moving to a \n9  community home, as her team has imposed inappropriate “readiness” criteria.  Moreover, there is a \n10  dearth of services for people with dual diagnoses in the community.  Thus, she unnecessarily \n11  remains in an institutional setting, which exacerbates her challenges. \n12  Andre Mills  \n13  32.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Andre Mills is a 17-year-old who has resided at Porterville DC \n14  since August 2000, and is a client of Kern Regional Center.  He has mild retardation, a mild bilateral \n15  hearing loss, speech impediments including a stutter and impulsivity problems.  His mother was a \n16  poly-substance abuser during her pregnancy with Mr. Mills and he was removed from her care  and \n17  raised by his grandmother from the age of nine months.  Mr. Mills appears in this action through his \n18  grandmother and guardian ad litem, Fannie Mae Robinson.  \n19  33.  Mr. Mills was in special education classes throughout his schooling, but was not \n20  identified as developmentally disabled until he was fifteen.  Thus, he received no regional center \n21  services during his childhood.  Mr. Mills disliked being teased by his peers for stuttering.  He was \n22  often suspended from school and was arrested for stealing a bicycle in 1999.  He was placed in \n23  juvenile hall, then in a children’s group home, was returned to juvenile hall and then transferred to \n24  Porterville. \n25  34.  Mr. Mills’ strengths include his independence in daily living skills (he can cook \n26  simple meals and make purchases), his cooperative attitude and motivation to succeed.  He is on the \n27  highest level of his unit’s point system and takes pride in being an officer in the unit government.  \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 8 \n \n\n \n1  35.  Mr. Mills’ planning team at Porterville has identified the services he would need to be \n2  successful in the community, including: a small 4-6 person group home near his grandmother, \n3  speech therapy, anger and behavior management, mental health services and crisis intervention.  \n4  Because his regional center has no space available in a home of this  type for minors, Mr. Mills \n5  remains inappropriately institutionalized at Porterville behind two 16-foot tall security fences \n6  patrolled by peace officers.  He is not able to leave the secure area without an escort and is not able \n7  to leave the Porterville campus for any community outings. \n8    Alana Ridgeway \n9  36.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Alana Ridgeway is a 46-year old Regional Center of Orange \n10  County (RCOC) client.  She has mild retardation, cerebral palsy, spina bifida and uses a wheelchair.  \n11  She has a history of depression with schizo-affective disorder.  Ms. Ridgeway appears in this action \n12  through her guardian ad litem and family friend, James Roberts.  \n13  37.  Ms. Ridgeway is an alert personable expressive woman who enjoys interacting with \n14  others.  She has a good sense of humo r and loves cartoons.   She is able to communicate verbally her \n15  wants, needs and preferences.  She wheels herself around and likes attending community activities. \n16  38.  While successfully living in a small group home, she attended an adult educational day \n17  program.  She was a confident, enthusiastic student who always “did her best.”  She was helpful and \n18  would assist her classmates with tasks.  She read poetry, participated in dramatic readings, \n19  improvisional acting and was an imaginative storyteller.  During music classes, she learned the \n20  autoharp and did not hesitate to sing out.   \n21  39.  Due to her family’s concerns regarding the quality of care Ms. Ridgeway was \n22  receiving at her home, they asked for her to be moved.   Instead of finding a new appropriate \n23  community home, RCOC referred her to a large skilled nursing facility (SNF), where she did not \n24  have a peer group.  Ms. Ridgeway repeatedly states she does not like interacting with the older \n25  residents who she has very little in common with.  In addition, her day program  activities ended \n26  when she was transferred.   \n27  40.  At the SNF, Ms. Ridgeway exhibits behavioral challenges that the staff are not \n28  equipped to address.  Thus, she has repeatedly been admitted to and released from the psychiatric \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 9 \n \n\n \n1  unit of the local hospital.  Most recently, the SNF did not hold her bed for the entire hospital stay, \n2  and she was sent to another similarly large SNF where she resides today.   \n3  41.  Ms. Ridgeway has been and still can be served in a small community home setting, \n4  with supports that meet her physical and mental health needs, but she remains inappropriately \n5  institutionalized due to the lack of available community homes. \n6    Avery Russell \n7  42.  Petitioner/Plaintiff Avery Russell is a 45-year-old man who has been residing at \n8  Agnews DC since 1999 and is a client of Far Northern Regional Center.   He has Prader Willi \n9  Syndrome, a condition that keeps him from being able to control his appetite, consequential obesity, \n10  diabetes, depression, and osteoporosis, as well as mild retardation.  Mr. Russell brings this action on \n11  his own behalf. \n12  43.  Mr. Russell is a sociable person who carries on conversations and is generally polite \n13  and considerate.  He is independent in daily living tasks and capable of sustained and meaningful \n14  employment.  He enjoys being paid for his work.   Mr. Russell currently has a paid job making beds \n15  on his residence and he self-initiated recycling cans and bottles for money.  He shops for personal \n16  items on community outings. \n17  44.  A psychological evaluation of Mr. Russell describes Prader Willi Syndrome as being \n18  characterized by an “insatiable appetite” and says that, “eating governs his life.” Mr. Russell’s \n19  planning team states that his dietary restriction appears as an antecedent to virtually all of his \n20  behavioral problems.  Agnews DC has not been able to contain Mr. Russell’s eating habits.  In fact, \n21  within one year of admission to Agnews DC in 1999, Mr. Russell gained more than 62 pounds \n22  bringing him to a weight of over 350 pounds.  Agnews staff feel they have tried numerous \n23  techniques to help him lose weight and none have worked.  \n24  45.  Mr. Russell has clearly expressed his desire to live in a community home for \n25  sometime.  He does not feel safe at Agnews as he has been injured by other residents; nor does he \n26  have many peers who can share his interests.  \n27 \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 10 \n \n\n \n1  46.  At his IPP meeting of October 2000, Mr. Russell was told that movement to the \n2  community would not be explored until he weighed less than 300 pounds and his behaviors had \n3  decreased.  The very nature of Mr. Russell’s disability was thus keeping him confined.   \n4  47.  Mr. Russell was not satisfied and sought a writ of release from the Superior Court of \n5  Santa Clara.  The court granted the writ in October 2001, stating that Agnews DC is not the least \n6  restrictive environment possible for Mr. Russell.  However, Mr. Russell remains inappropriately \n7  institutionalized as living arrangements with appropriate supports has not been located or developed \n8  by his regional center. \n9    Melbert Schanzenbach \n10  48.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Melbert Schanzenbach is a 78-year-old man who has resided at \n11  Sonoma DC since 1993 and is a client of Alta California Regional Center (ACRC).  Mr. \n12  Schanzenbach has moderate retardation and a lymph edema condition in one leg, which necessitates \n13  that he use a walker to get around and be seen three times a week in a physical ther apy clinic.  Mr. \n14  Schanzenbach appears in this action through his guardian ad litem, Merry Edwards.    \n15  49.  Mr. Schanzenbach communicates using basic words in both English and German.  He \n16  has considerable freedom to come and go from his unit independently.  He es pecially enjoys going \n17  to work and loves anything mechanical.  Mr. Schanzenbach also enjoys outings and behaves \n18  appropriately while in the community.   \n19  50.  In June 2001, Mr. Schanzenbach’s IPP Team determined that “there is currently no \n20  viable option for Melbert on any residence within SDC.”  Mr. Schanzenbach’s program director \n21  emphasized that placement outside of Sonoma DC as soon as possible was “essential and crucial.”  \n22  51.  The IPP Team determined Mr. Schanzenbach would succeed in a supported living \n23  arrangement.  ACRC had been pursuing group homes in which Mr. Schanzenbach’s team felt he \n24  would regress.  Mr. Schanzenbach would like to move to supported living and his brother, sister -in-\n25  law, and nephew support this.  Moving to the Sacramento area would also allow fo r his 80-year-old \n26  relatives to visit him more often.  The Sonoma County Superior Court is requiring ACRC to report \n27  monthly on their progress in developing a community home. \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 11 \n \n\n \n1  52.  Yet, more than six months later Mr. Schanzenbach remains at Sonoma DC solely \n2  because ACRC has not located or developed a supported living provider and the medical supports he \n3  needs to successfully move to a community home. \n4    Jimmy White \n5  53.  Plaintiff /Petitioner Jimmy White is a 60-year-old man who has resided in institutions \n6  for most of his life.  He currently resides at Sonoma DC and is a client of Regional Center of the \n7  East Bay.  Mr. White is mildly retarded and has borderline personality disorder; however, it is his \n8  Pica disorder, a compulsion to swallow inedible objects, which has resulted in his \n9  institutionalization.  Mr. White is very social and is able to engage in moderately complex \n10  conversation.  He is proud of his work at the institution's laundry and has accumulated $900 in his \n11  workshop savings account.  Mr. White appears in this action through his guardian ad litem, Areta \n12  Guthrey. \n13  54.  There is no peer group for Mr. White at Sonoma which matches his intellectual ability.  \n14  Staff at Sonoma believes that Mr. White’s ingestion of foreign objects may be interpreted as a \n15  coping mechanism used for surviving in an environment that he has very little control over and is \n16  aimed at obtaining more attention and independence.  Episodes of Pica occur most often when Mr. \n17  White feels that his desires are being ignored.  When his needs are met, his episod es of Pica have \n18  greatly decreased and even stopped for long periods of time.  \n19  55.  Mr. White consistently expresses his desire to live in the community.  In June 2000, \n20  the Sonoma County Superior Court requested that Mr. White's treatment team meet and outline the \n21  structural conditions which would allow him to be released from Sonoma DC into a community \n22  option where he could reside safely.  In July 2000, the team agreed on a list of supports Mr. White \n23  would need in the community, including a 1:1 staff ratio which he currently receives in the DC. Yet, \n24  by May 2001, no progress had been made and Mr. White filed a writ with the Court seeking \n25  appropriate community services.  In July 2001, his IPP team met to clarify placement planning \n26  issues and determined that customized supported living arrangements would best meet Mr. White's \n27  unique needs.  The team anticipated that the intensity of Mr. White's needs would decrease in such a \n28  setting commensurate with his increased personal satisfaction. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 12 \n \n\n \n1  56.  Over the summer, Regional Center of the East Bay contacted supported living \n2  agencies in its area and was told they were full and had lengthy waiting lists.  Instead of developing \n3  the services Mr. White requires, the regional center has kept Mr. White’s writ from Court review by \n4  continually requesting postponement on the grounds that there continues to be no appropriate \n5  provider available to meet his needs.  Thus, despite the efforts of Mr. White, the recommendations of \n6  his team and the actions of the Court, Mr. White remains inappropria tely institutionalized.  \n7    Shawn Woodward-Katz \n8  57.  Plaintiff/Petitioner Shawn Woodward-Katz is a 20-year-old man who has resided at \n9  Fairview DC since 1998 and is a client of San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center.  He has mild \n10  retardation, a variety of mental health diagnoses, including oppositional-defiant disorder, and a long \n11  history of disability-related behavioral problems.  He appears in this action through his guardian ad \n12  litem, Patricia Blumenthal.   \n13  58.  Mr. Woodward-Katz is extremely verbal with an extensive voc abulary and is able to \n14  articulate his feelings, wants and needs.  He has awareness of his behavioral issues.  He is friendly \n15  and outgoing.  Mr. Woodward-Katz attends a public high school in a special education program.  \n16  59.  Mr. Woodward-Katz has not been well-served by a variety of social services system \n17  throughout his life.  He was removed from his mother early in life, made a ward of the court and \n18  placed in a series of foster homes.  When he was nine, he was moved to a stable foster home with \n19  Mr. and Mrs. H.  In 1993, when his foster father died, he became extremely upset and his acting out \n20  resulted in his arrest and removal from the Hs’ home.  Mrs. H and his foster brother continue to be \n21  involved in Mr. Woodward-Katz’s life. \n22  60.  In 1994, Mr. Woodward-Katz was placed in a state psychiatric hospital, Camarillo \n23  State Hospital, where it was determined for the first time that he had a developmental disability.  Mr. \n24  Woodward-Katz moved to another state psychiatric hospital, Metropolitan State Hospital, in 1997, \n25  and in 1998, he was confined for six months in MacLaren Children’s Center, a juvenile detention \n26  facility which is not intended to provide long term services.  During these years, his formal \n27  education was limited. \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 13 \n \n\n \n1  61.  Since his arrival at Fairview, Mr. Woodward-Katz has repeatedly expressed his \n2  feelings that he is inappropriately placed.  He is one of the youngest and most able (high -\n3  functioning) men on his unit so he does not have a peer group.  He tends to tease the less able \n4  residents, resulting in behavioral problems.  He typically prefers to socialize with staff and his \n5  behaviors are exacerbated when his favorite staff leave.  \n6  62.  In May 2001, Mr. Woodward-Katz filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking to leave \n7  Fairview.  Mr. Woodward-Katz and Ms. Blumental, his advocate, requested San Gabriel/Pomona \n8  Regional Center to obtain an assessment for supported living services so he could move to his own \n9  apartment near his foster mother.  In supported living, Mr. Woodward -Katz would not have less-able \n10  housemates, could control his own schedule and have a voice in selecting his own staff.  This would \n11  mitigate his behavioral challenges.  The Fairview planning team supported this request and agreed \n12  that Mr. Woodward-Katz is ready to move to the community.  The court has continued the writ  \n13  hearing awaiting results of the assessment. \n14  63.  More than six months later, an adequate assessment for supported living services has \n15  not been obtained and Mr. Woodward-Katz remains frustrated and depressed by his inappropriate \n16  institutionalization.  \n17    Lucien Corpolongo \n18    63 A. Lucien Corpolongo is a twenty-seven-year-old consumer of Harbor Regional Center   \n19  (HRC) and became a resident of Intercommunity Care Center, a large Nursing Facility (“Nursing \n20  Facility”) with locked main doors and perimeter fences, in May  2005.     \n21    63 B. With a dual diagnosis of a developmental disability (mild retardation) and a psychiatric \n22  disability (often diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder), Mr. Corpolongo is eligible for both mental \n23  health services and regional center services.  Nonetheless, due to a lack of coordination between \n24  these two systems, Mr. Corpolongo does not receive the services and supports that he needs.    \n25    63 C. Immediately prior to being admitted to the Nursing Facility, Mr. Corpolongo spent five \n26  months inappropriately placed in the acute psychiatric ward of Pacific Oaks Hospital.  On \n27  information and belief, Mr. Corpolongo resided at this hospital for far longer than was medically \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 14 \n \n\n \n1  necessary; the hospital, designed for short-term stays, provided high doses of psychiatric medication, \n2  with no appropriate treatment regimen.     \n3    63 D. On April 26, 2005, Pacific Oaks Hospital, frustrated by HRC’s failure to provide \n4  services to Mr. Corpolongo, called Doug Corpolongo (Mr. Corpolongo’s father), threatening to \n5  abandon Mr. Corpolongo at HRC’s offices. This crisis was averted, but Mr. Corpolongo remained at \n6  the hospital without a stable living situation for nearly another month.  \n7    63 E. Finally, the alternative that HRC offered Mr. Corpolongo was a Nursing Facility, an \n8  institutional setting not designed to meet his unique needs as a young man with a dual diagnosis.  \n9  Mr. Corpolongo wants to live with peers in an integrated community setting, but on information and \n10  belief, the Nursing Facility where he has been placed is designed to  house confused, wandering, \n11  geriatric people.  Mr. Corpolongo enjoys having independence:  his ability to carry on a \n12  conversation, feed himself, perform all hygiene and grooming requirements, and prepare non-cooked \n13  food testify to the inappropriateness of the Nursing Facility placement. \n14    63 F.  Mr. Corpolongo is represented in this action by his father, conservator, and guardian \n15  ad litem, Doug Corpolongo.   \n16    Sharon Forster \n17    63 G. Sharon Forster, a sixty-five-year-old consumer of Golden Gate Regional Center \n18  (“GGRC”), has lived at Burlingame Healthcare Center, a large Nursing Facility, since January 11, \n19  2004.  Cerebral palsy impairs Ms. Forster’s speech, mobility, and use of her hands; she also has \n20  asthma.  She uses an electric wheelchair and needs assistance with transfers to and from her \n21  wheelchair, although she helps by bearing some weight on her legs.  \n22    63 H. Ms. Forster, unlike other residents of the Nursing Facility, is not cognitively impaired; \n23  most other Burlingame residents have dementia or some other red uction in cognitive function, so \n24  Ms. Forster lives surrounded by people who either are non-verbal or cannot communicate \n25  meaningfully with her.  Despite the fact that most of its 250 residents use wheelchairs, Burlingame \n26  has only two elevators, making it challenging for residents to access the outside world.  An ardent \n27  fan of San Francisco Giants baseball, Ms. Forster is often frustrated when Burlingame staff insist on \n28  putting her to bed at 9:30 p.m., in the middle of televised Giants games.  \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 15 \n \n\n \n1    63 I. Ms. Forster is a warm, outgoing person with many friends.  Her interests and hobbies \n2  include reading novels, dancing, listening to music, swimming, and going to parties at the Veterans’ \n3  Memorial Center.   \n4    63 J. Ms. Forster moved to Burlingame after living for two  years in San Mateo Medical \n5  Center, an acute-care hospital, after undergoing surgery.  Inappropriately placed at the hospital for \n6  almost two years after she had recuperated from surgery and was ready for discharge, Ms. Forster \n7  could not be released because GGRC found no placement for her.  She was finally informed by \n8  GGRC that the only available placement was a nursing facility, and she has been at Burlingame ever \n9  since.   \n10    63 K. Prior to hospitalization, Ms. Forster lived independently in her own Redwood Ci ty \n11  home for over fifty years, first with her mother, then with an attendant.  She was able to move about \n12  the community as she pleased.  Ms. Forster is a well-known and an active member of her \n13  community.  Her biggest dream is to return to a community residence with supports so that she can \n14  make her own decisions about where to go, what to eat, what time to go to bed, and other matters, \n15  rather than being reliant on Burlingame staff.  \n16    Jacob Ashbrook Myers \n17    63 L. Jacob Ashbrook Myers is a twenty-six-year-old consumer of North Bay Regional \n18  Center (“NBRC”).  He has been a resident of Sonoma DC since August 2000.  Prior to moving to a \n19  DC, Mr. Myers lived first at home with his parents, then at two group homes in the community.  \n20    63 M. Mr. Myers has been diagnosed with autism, mild to moderate retardation, diabetes, \n21  traits associated with conduct disorder, spondylosis causing back pain, and seizure disorder.  \n22  Compared to the population of individuals with autism, Mr. Myers has relatively good receptive \n23  language skills and is able to express his needs and desires verbally.    \n24    63 N. For years, Mr. Myers has stated a strong preference for living on his own, as he does \n25  not like crowded situations and is very sensitive to stimulation; at Sonoma, he lives with at least 20 \n26  people and is exposed to a great deal of stimulation.  Mr. Myers dislikes chaotic, noisy, crowded \n27  environments where he is in close contact with others, but thrives in structured, interesting, engaging \n28  environments where he can exercise independence and dec ision-making ability.  \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 16 \n \n\n \n1    63 O. DC staff support Mr. Myers’ consistently expressed wish to move into an integrated \n2  setting in the community; however, neither the DC nor NBRC has taken appropriate action to find a \n3  community home for Mr. Myers.  Finally, Mr. Myers filed a writ seeking release from the DC; the \n4  court granted his writ in September 2004, yet NBRC still failed to take sufficient action to assist him \n5  in moving into the community.  Indeed, NBRC attempted to find an appropriate community living \n6  arrangement for Mr. Myers only when it was at risk of being found in contempt of court, in both \n7  December 2004 and March 2005. \n8    63 P. Mr. Myers is represented in this action by his guardians ad litem:  his mother (Kay \n9  Ashbrook) and his father (Ray Myers), who also  serve as his limited conservators. \n10    John Pineda \n11    63 Q. John Pineda is a forty-year-old consumer of Kern Regional Center who has lived at \n12  Porterville DC for 10 years and previously lived for many years at Camarillo DC.  Mr. Pineda has \n13  profound retardation, blindness, insulin-dependent diabetes, a history of seizures, and a severe \n14  hearing impairment; he uses a wheelchair.  While he cannot speak, he can use simple signs, yells, \n15  and cries to indicate his likes and dislikes and can respond to loud, simple reque sts.  \n16    63 R. Because of the nature or severity of his disability, Mr. Pineda cannot express his choice \n17  with respect to living arrangements; however, he never made a decision to be placed at a DC, and the \n18  legal presumption should be that he would choose to live in the most integrated setting in which his \n19  needs can be met, rather than to remain unnecessarily institutionalized.  Moreover, it is clear that Mr. \n20  Pineda often prefers to be alone and does not like crowded, noisy environments or others invading \n21  his space, situations often encountered in a DC.  Mr. Pineda’s family does not oppose his moving to \n22  an appropriate community setting.   \n23    63 S. According to his assessment planning team, Mr. Pineda would benefit from moving to \n24  a community home.  Kern Regional Center has included Mr. Pineda in its Community Placement \n25  Plan but is having difficulty locating or developing the resources that are necessary to meet his \n26  health needs as an insulin-dependent diabetic.  Kern Regional Center’s attempt to place Mr. Pineda \n27  in a small Intermediate Care Facility/Developmental Disabilities-Nursing has been stymied by State \n28  Defendant California Department of Health Services.  Kern Regional Center has also explored other \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 17 \n \n\n \n1  placements, but necessary resources are difficult to find in  his community.  Since Mr. Pineda does \n2  not need to be institutionalized, defendants must develop an appropriate community living \n3  arrangement that can meet his needs. \n4    63 T.  Mr. Pineda is represented in this action by his guardian ad litem, Deborah A. \n5  Dorfman.  \n6       Jane Schuster \n7    63 U. Jane Schuster is a forty-three-year-old consumer of Alta California Regional Center \n8  (“Alta”), and has been a resident of Gardens Healthcare, a large Intermediate Care \n9  Facility/Developmental Disabilities institution (“ICF/DD institution”), since August 1983.  She has \n10  expressed an interest in moving out of the ICF/DD institution for years, but has not received \n11  appropriate support from Alta. \n12    63. V. Ms. Schuster, who has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, spastic bladder, \n13  gastroesophageal reflux disorder, a psychiatric disability, and mild to borderline retardation, uses a \n14  power wheelchair.  She has good receptive communication skills, talks understandably, and is a very \n15  sociable person with strong family support. \n16    63. W. Having expressed a strong interest in moving into the community for several years, \n17  Ms Schuster is particularly eager to move to a supported living arrangement  – a home of her own \n18  with supports.  Her requests have been approved by the Alta Supported Living Services c ommittee.  \n19  Nonetheless, Alta views movement to the community as a long -term goal.  On information and \n20  belief, Alta has made no attempt to locate or develop supported living services for Ms. Schuster.  \n21  Instead, Alta has applied inappropriate readiness criteria, requiring Ms. Schuster to improve her \n22  continence prior to community placement and to manage her moods more effectively.  Supported \n23  living services are available “regardless of the degree of disability.”  Welf. Inst. Code § 4689; thus, \n24  Ms. Shuster should be able to move to supported living without waiting to meet the readiness criteria \n25  imposed by Alta. \n26    63 X.  Ms. Schuster is represented in this action by her guardian ad litem, Tony Anderson.  \n27 \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 18 \n \n\n \n1  Taxpayer Petitioners/Plaintiffs \n2  64.

Each of the regional center defendants is a recipient of state and federal funds and \n5  administers, oversees and, in limited circumstances, provides services funded under Title XIX.  \n6  103.  Petitioners/plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of \n7  respondents/defendants sued herein as Does 1 through 100 inclusive, and therefore, sue these \n8  defendants by such fictitious names.  Plaintiffs will amend this complaint to allege their true names \n9  and capacities when ascertained. \n10  104.  Because this action is brought a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, as well \n11  as through a petition for mandamus relief, references to plaintiffs are also references to petitioners, \n12  and references to defendants are also references to respondents. \n13  IV. \n14  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n15  105.  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 382, the representative plaintiffs named \n16  above bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated.  The \n17  plaintiff class consists of all Californians with developmental disabilities, as defined in Welfare and \n18  Institutions Code section 4512(b), who are or will be  institutionalized, and those who are or will be \n19  at risk of being institutionalized, in either public or private facilities including, but not limited to, the \n20  Developmental Centers (DCs), Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Intermediate Care Facilities – \n21  Developmentally Disabled (ICF-DDs), large congregate Community Care Facilities (CCFs), \n22  psychiatric hospitals, or children’s shelters. \n23  106.  The class includes all California residents with developmental disabilities who are \n24  institutionalized or at risk of institutionalization.  All of these class members are entitled, under the \n25  Lanterman Act, the Government Code section 11135, the ADA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n26  Act, the State and Federal Constitutions and/or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, to be informed \n27  of and to adequate assessments of the services which could meet their needs and choices in non -\n28  institutional integrated community settings.  Those class memb ers who can “handle and benefit” \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 26 \n \n\n \n1  from community services and/or live in less restrictive integrated settings are entitled, under these \n2  same laws, to receive appropriate community living options and ancillary supports with reasonable \n3  promptness.  Due to defendants’ policies and practices, many class members have never received \n4  adequate assessments or information, in an understandable form, about community service options.  \n5  Other class members have already been determined, through assessments and/or by their  planning \n6  teams and/or by courts, to need community services.  Yet, due to defendants’ policies, practices and \n7  funding methods, they remain needlessly institutionalized.  Members of the plaintiff class are \n8  suffering and will continue to suffer harm as a result of being denied these mandated assessments \n9  and quality community services. \n10  107.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that over 6,000 people with developmental \n11  disabilities in California are unnecessarily institutionalized or at risk of becoming so, including  a \n12  substantial proportion of the approximately 3,730 current residents of the state-operated DCs and  \n13  the approximately 1,000 current residents of publicly or privately operated nursing facilities.  The \n14  needs and desires of these individuals could appropriately be met in more integrated community \n15  settings.  The size of the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Joinder is \n16  also impracticable because the plaintiff class lacks the knowledge and financial means to maintain \n17  individual actions and because the class includes people who will be unnecessarily institutionalized \n18  or at risk in the future and their identities are unknowable.  \n19  108.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class and the plaintiffs’ claims are \n20  typical of the claims of the class.  These questions include, but are not limited to: \n21  a)  Whether defendants violate the integration mandates of the Lanterman Act, \n22  ADA, section 504 and Government Code section 11135 by requiring plaintiffs to be \n23  segregated and confined unnecessarily in institutional settings in order to receive the living \n24  arrangements and ancillary supports to  which they are entitled, rather than providing those \n25  services in appropriate integrated settings in plaintiffs’ homes and communities.  \n26  b)  Whether defendants violate plaintiffs’ fundamental constitutional rights, \n27  including their rights to liberty, privacy and freedom of association by confining plaintiffs to \n28  segregated institutional settings as appropriate community options are not available; \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 27 \n \n\n \n1  c)  Whether regional center defendants violate Business and Professions Code \n2  section 17200.  \n3  d)  Whether defendants fail to conduct adequate, timely and comprehensive \n4  assessments and develop the person-centered Individual Program Plans necessary to identify \n5  the services for which class members are eligible and that could meet their needs in less \n6  restrictive, more integrated community settings. \n7  e)  Whether defendants fail to ensure that an adequate array of appropriate quality \n8  community living options and the necessary ancillary supports are developed so that class \n9  members may access the services and supports needed to live in non -institutional community \n10  settings. \n11  f)  Whether defendants fail to apply for or allocate adequate funding to enable \n12  defendants DDS and regional centers to conduct  said assessments and develop said resources \n13  and to enable service providers to provide quality services and supports with well-trained, \n14  stable staff. \n15  g)  Whether defendants fail to effectively communicate information concerning \n16  alternatives to institutional care to persons at risk of placement into institutions, to residents \n17  of such institutions, and to their legal representatives, as required, for example, by the \n18  Lanterman Act and Title XIX of the Social Security Act. \n19  h)  Whether defendants fail to inform institut ionalized individuals or persons at \n20  risk of institutionalization of the availability of home and community-based services under \n21  federal Medicaid waiver programs for which they are eligible, to offer individuals a \n22  meaningful choice of home and community-based services in lieu of institutional care and to \n23  provide those services. \n24  i)  Whether defendants fail to offer and provide with reasonable promptness \n25  Medicaid services, including home and community-based waiver services, for which \n26  residents of institutions such as the DCs, SNFs or ICF-DDs, or persons at risk of placement \n27  in such institutions, are eligible and which they need to live in more integrated, community -\n28  based settings.  \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 28 \n \n\n \n1  109.  The claims of the named representative plaintiffs—including claims that defendants \n2  have violated their rights to proper assessments and to receive appropriate living arrangements and \n3  ancillary services in integrated, non-institutional settings—are typical of the class members’ claims.  \n4  These claims arise from the same unlawful and discriminatory policies and practices of defendants. \n5  110.  The representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n6  Plaintiffs will vigorously represent the interests of the unnamed class members and all members of \n7  the proposed class will benefit by the class proposed by the plaintiffs.  The named plaintiffs have no \n8  interests which are in conflict with other class members.  Plaintiffs and the class are represented by \n9  qualified, experienced, and competent counsel. \n10  111.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a \n11  risk of inconsistent or varying adjudication establishing incompatible rules of law for the provision \n12  of services to people with developmental disabilities in California. \n13  112.  Defendants, their agents, employees, and predecessors and successors in office, have \n14  acted, refused to act, or will act, or refuse to act on grounds applicable to the class, thereby making \n15  appropriate final injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a who le. \n16  V. \n17  LEGAL FRAMEWORK \n18  A.  The Lanterman Act Scheme  \n19  113.  The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) is a \n20  comprehensive statutory scheme which sets out the rights of people with developmental disabilities \n21  in California and the responsibilities of the State towards such individuals.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n22  § 4500, et seq.  Under this scheme, plaintiffs are entitled to treatment, services and supports which, \n23  to the maximum extent possible, are provided in natural community settings, and assist them to \n24  achieve the most independent, productive and normal lives possible.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n25  § 4502(a)(b).  Lanterman Act services are intended to meet the needs and choices of each p erson \n26  with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or degree of disability, and to promote his or her \n27  integration into the mainstream of the community.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4501.  Such services must \n28  protect the personal liberty of the individual, be provided with the least restrictive conditions \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 29 \n \n\n \n1  necessary to achieve the purposes of the treatment, services or supports, and enable the individual to \n2  approximate the pattern of every day living available to people without disabilities of the same age.  \n3  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4501, 4502(a)(b), 4750.  \n4  114.  One of the primary purposes of the Lanterman Act is to avoid unnecessary \n5  institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities.  Ass’n for Retarded Citizens–Cal. v. \n6  DDS, 38 Cal.3d 384 (1985) (“ARC”). \n7  115.  The Legislature determined that Lanterman Act services were so unique, they could \n8  not satisfactorily be provided by state agencies.  Thus, direct responsibility for implementing the \n9  Lanterman Act is allocated between the state department, DDS, and twenty-one private non-profit \n10  community agencies, the regional centers, which, pursuant to contracts with DDS, provide services \n11  to individuals who reside or once resided in a specified geographic area.  Welf. & Inst. Code §  4620, \n12  et seq. \n13  116.  Defendant DDS, under the control of its director, defendant Allenby (collectively \n14  referred to as DDS), is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Lanterman Act is fully \n15  implemented.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4416.  Additionally, DDS’ roles include, but are not limited to: \n16  a)  Contracting with, supporting and monitoring regional centers to ensure, inter alia, \n17  that the regional centers operate in compliance with federal and state law, provide high \n18  quality service coordination, services and supports to individuals and their families, and th ose \n19  individuals receive the services and support identified in their individual program plans.  \n20  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4434, 4500.5, 4501, 4620; \n21  b)  Allocating funds to the regional centers for both operations and purchase of \n22  services, including specific funding to purchase community supports for those who are \n23  projected to move into the community from the DCs.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4620, 4787;  \n24  c)  Operating the seven public institutions for people with developmental \n25  disabilities – the DCs. Welf. & Inst. Code § 4440, et seq.; and \n26  d)  Providing staff to assist in the deflection of individuals from placement in and \n27  transition of individuals out of the DCs to community homes.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4418.3, \n28  4418.7.  For this purpose, DDS has created the Regional Resource Development Projects. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 30 \n \n\n \n1  117.  Regional centers are to “assist persons with developmental disabilities and their \n2  families in securing those services and supports which maximize opportunities and choices in living, \n3  working, learning and recreating in the community.”  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4640.7(a). \n4  118.  Regional centers function on a service coordination model, in which each individual \n5  they serve, including plaintiffs and others in the DCs and other public and private institutions, should \n6  have a designated service coordinator who is responsible for planning and providing or ensuring that \n7  needed services and supports are available to the individual and family.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n8  §§ 4640.7(b), 4647. \n9  119.  The centerpiece of the Lanterman Act scheme is the individualized person-centered \n10  planning process through which decisions are made concerning appropriate least restrictive \n11  treatment, services and supports for each person served by a regional center, including those residing \n12  in the DCs and other public and private institutions. \n13  120.  The planning team consists of the person and his/her representatives, the designated \n14  regional center service coordinator, other regional center representatives, if needed, DC staff if the \n15  person resides in a DC, and additional appropriate professionals or service providers by invitation.  \n16  The team jointly prepares a person-centered individual program plan (IPP).  Welf. & Inst. Code \n17  §§ 4418.3, 4512(j), 4646, 4646.5, and 4647. \n18  121.  In order to enable people with developmental disabilities, and their representatives, to \n19  participate meaningfully in the IPP process, DDS and regional centers must provide information in \n20  an understandable form to aid people in making choices.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4502.01.  \n21  122.  The planning process includes the conducting of assessments by qualified individuals \n22  to determine the life goals, capabilities, strengths, preferences, barriers, and concerns or problems of \n23  the individual.  The IPP contains a statement of goals based upon the individual’s needs, preferences \n24  and life choices; a statement of specific objectives for implementing the person’s goals and \n25  addressing his or her needs and a schedule of the type of amount of services and supports to be \n26  provided.  The goals should maximize opportunities and teach skills needed for the person to \n27  develop relationships, be part of community life, increase control over his or her life and acquire \n28  increasingly positive roles in the community.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646.5. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 31 \n \n\n \n1  123.  Planning teams must give the highest preference to those services and supports which \n2  allow minors to live with their families and adults to live as independently as possible in the \n3  community.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(a)(1).  Thus, the planning team is required to consider for \n4  each resident of a DC or other institution whether alternative i ntegrated community services can be \n5  provided.  See also Welf. & Inst. Code § 4509. \n6  124.  In California, services for people with developmental disabilities are an “entitlement.”  \n7  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648; ARC, 38 Cal.3d 384.  Once services or supports are included in an \n8  individual’s IPP, the regional center has a mandatory non-discretionary duty to provide these \n9  services and supports.   The regional center must secure the services specified in the IPP, including \n10  community living arrangements and ancillary supports, by referral or purchase or, if needed services \n11  are not currently available, by program development.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4648(d)(e), 4651, and \n12  4677. \n13  125.  DDS’ authority is limited in that it cannot control the manner in which the regional \n14  center provides services nor can it amend or alter the IPP’s determination of service needs.   ARC, 38 \n15  Cal.3d 384. \n16  126.  Defendants DDS and regional centers have an obligation together and separately to \n17  provide an array of community living arrangements.  Living arrangements include, but are not \n18  limited to, supported living where an adult lives in his/her own home with supports; adult family \n19  homes; alternative/foster family homes for children; and small group homes licensed either as \n20  community care facilities (CCF), or intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled, \n21  designated as habilitative (ICF-DD/H) or nursing (ICF-DD/N).  Minors and adults with \n22  developmental disabilities may also receive family supports when they live with their families.  E.g., \n23  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(a)(9)(A). \n24  127.  Defendants DDS and regional centers must also provide or arrange for the provision of \n25  a broad array of ancillary services that are necessary for an individual to live successfully in the \n26  community including, but not limited to, supported or sheltered employment, day activities, \n27  occupational or physical therapy, adaptive equipment, mental health services, behavioral training \n28  and behavior modification programs, daily living skills training, transportation, assistance in locating \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 32 \n \n\n \n1  a home, education, recreation, community integration supports and specialized medical and dental \n2  care.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4612(b).  (Referred to jointly throughout as “ancillary” services.)  \n3  128.  In order that the mandated array of quality services and supports is avail able.  DDS is \n4  required to establish and maintain equitable systems of payment for the providers of services and \n5  supports, which reflect the actual costs of ensuring high quality, stable services, and ensure that \n6  people live in the least restrictive setting.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4648(a)(5), 4680, 4690, 4697, \n7  4786. \n8  129.  If the services and supports needed by an individual to live in the least restrictive \n9  community setting are not currently available, regional centers are to engage in program \n10  development.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(d)(e).  DDS may be required to provide the services or \n11  supports directly where there are identified gaps in the system of services or where there are \n12  identified consumers for whom no provider will provide the services in his/her IPP.  W elf. & Inst. \n13  Code § 4648(g). \n14  130.  In order that people with developmental disabilities not lose their community homes, \n15  DDS and regional centers are specifically required to provide emergency and crisis intervention \n16  services.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(a)(10).  DDS and regional centers must also arrange for an \n17  assessment of any individual whose community living arrangement is failing causing the likelihood \n18  of admittance to a DC and ensure that the regional center provides needed services and supports on \n19  an emergency basis.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4418.7. \n20  131.  Special attention is paid in the Lanterman Act to the needs of people who are dually \n21  diagnosed – meaning they have a psychiatric disability as well as a developmental disability.  Welf. \n22  & Inst. Code § 4646.  DDS is required to consider, with the Department of Mental Health (DMH), \n23  higher rates for living arrangements for the dually diagnosed. Welf. & Inst. Code § 4681(d).  \n24  Cooperative efforts between regional centers and county mental health agencies are mandated.  \n25  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4696.1(c). \n26  132.  The provision of services under the Lanterman Act is intended to reflect the cost -\n27  effective use of public resources and to assure the maximum use of federal funding.  Welf. & Inst. \n28  Code §§ 4645(a), 4683.  Further, Welfare and Institutions Code section 4657 requires defendants \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 33 \n \n\n \n1  DDS and regional centers to use innovative, economical programs, techniques and staffing to carry \n2  out their obligations to provide services in the least restrictive setting.  \n3 \nB.  Anti-Discrimination Laws:  Americans with Disabilities Act Section 504 and \nGovernment Code Section 11135 \n4 \n133.  In enacting the ADA, Congress was particularly concerned about the unnecessary \n5 \nsegregation and institutionalization of people with disabilities and the resulting lack of full \n6 \nparticipation in and access to community services and activities.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), (a)(5), \n7 \n(a)(8), 28 C.F.R. § 35.130. \n8 \n134.  Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities, such as State defendants, from \n9 \ndiscriminating against the individuals with disabilities that they serve.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12132.  \n10 \nDiscrimination under the ADA includes the segregation and isolation of persons with disabilities \n11 \nfrom society as a result of unnecessary institutionalization.   Olmstead v. LC, 527 U.S 581 (1999). \n12 \n135.  The regulations promulgated under Title II specifically provide that “a public entity \n13 \nshall administer services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n14 \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  In the section-by-section \n15 \nanalysis that accompanied issuance of Title II’s binding regulations, the Attorney General defined \n16 \n“integrated setting” as “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact  with \n17 \nnondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible ... “  56 Fed. Reg. 35705 (Jul. 26, 1991).  \n18 \n136.    The ADA regulations also specify a variety of requirements to ensure \n19 \nnondiscrimination, including the provision of access, modification of practices and policies, and the \n20 \nprovision of auxiliary aides and services.  28 C.F.R. Part 35.  The regulations prohibit the defendants \n21 \nfrom administering programs in a discriminatory manner.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i). \n22 \n137.  The regulations also prohibit discrimination caused by providing different or separate \n23 \nservices to individuals based on the severity of their disability, unless necessary for the services to be \n24 \neffective.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iv). \n25 \n138.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, on which the ADA is modeled, s ets forth similar \n26 \nprotections against discrimination by recipients of federal funds, such as the State and regional \n27 \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 34 \n \n\n \n1  center defendants herein, including prohibiting unnecessary segregation.  29 U.S.C. §  794, et seq., 45 \n2  C.F.R. § 84.4 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51.  \n3  139.  California law also contains similar protection against discrimination by the State and \n4  by the State and recipients of state funds, such as the regional center defendants herein, including the \n5  requirement to provide services in the most integrated setting possible.  Gov’t Code § 11135.  \n6  Government Code section 11135(b) says that state law provides at least the same protections as are \n7  available under the ADA and its implementing regulations, but may provide even stronger \n8  protections. \n9  C.  The Medicaid Scheme \n10  140.  Medicaid is a federal program administered jointly by the federal and state \n11  governments to provide medical services to low-income persons pursuant to Title XIX of the Social \n12  Security Act, and to provide health, rehabilitation and other services to help them attain or retain \n13  capability for independence or self care.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq.  Over 50% of the cost of \n14  medical care through Medicaid is federally funded.  65 Fed. Reg. 69560 (2000).  \n15  141.  The purpose of Title XIX of the Social Security Act is to “enabl[e] each State ... to \n16  furnish ... rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain \n17  capacity for independence or self-care.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396. \n18  142.  The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (previously known as the \n19  Health Care Financing Administration) of the United States Department of Health and Human \n20  Services (HHS) is the agency which administers Medicaid at the federal level.  A state’s \n21  participation in Medicaid is voluntary.  States that choose to participate in the Medicaid program \n22  receive federal matching funds for their Medicaid program.  To receive federal funds, states must \n23  comply with the requirements of the federal Medicaid Act and with the federal regulations g overning \n24  state Medicaid programs promulgated by the HHS.  42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq.; 42 C.F.R. § 430, et \n25  seq.  Each state must submit an appropriate Medicaid plan to CMS.   \n26  143.  California participates in the Medicaid program called “Medi-Cal.”  Welf. & Inst. \n27  Code § 14000, et seq.  Medi-Cal is administered by defendant Bontá, the Director of DHS, the state \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 35 \n \n\n \n1  agency responsible for administering Medi-Cal mandatory, optional and waiver services.  42 U.S.C. \n2  § 1396a(a)(5); Welf. & Inst. Code § 14137; 22 Cal. Code Regs. § 50004.   \n3  144.  Medi-Cal must “provide such safeguards as may be necessary to assure ... such care \n4  and services will be provided, in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best \n5  interests of the recipients.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(19). \n6  145.  Title XIX requires states that participate in the Medicaid program to make certain \n7  mandatory medical assistance benefits available.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  These mandatory \n8  services include, inter alia, inpatient hospital services, physician’s services, and nursing facility \n9  services.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(D). \n10  146.  In addition to these mandatory services, Medi-Cal, also provides optional benefits, \n11  such as funding for intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (“ICF/MR”).  42 U.S.C. \n12  §§ 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a)(15); Welf. & Inst. Code § 14007.9. \n13  147.  Federal law authorizes some federal rules to be “waived” so that a state can provide \n14  and receive federal reimbursement for extra Medi-Cal services to a targeted group of individuals \n15  who would otherwise qualify for Medi-Cal funded long-term care.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1).  Waiver \n16  services allow individuals who would otherwise require care in an institution to receive services in \n17  their own homes or in home -like settings in the community.  42 C.F.R. § 441.300.   \n18  148.  The purpose of Title XIX’s home and community-based waivers is to encourage states \n19  to provide services to assist individuals with disabilities to avoid institutionalization.  \n20  a)  Title XIX  requires that persons with disabilities who live in or are at risk of \n21  being placed in an institution be informed of and given a meaningful choice of “feasible \n22  alternatives” available under the waivers.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(C),  42 C.F.R. §§ \n23  435.217, 441.302(d)(1)-(2).  \n24  b)  A State must offer waiver services to eligible individuals with “reasonable \npromptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).   \n25 \nc)  Title XIX also requires participating states to “provide such methods and \n26 \nprocedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available \n27 \nunder the plan… as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 36 \n \n\n \n1  care and services…” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(a).  In requiring states to provide methods and \n2  procedures of payment “to safeguard against unnecessary utilization,” Congress intended to \n3  “provid[e] suitable alternatives to institutional care.”  113 Cong. Rec. 11417 (1967).  The \n4  Committee Report to Title XIX stressed “assuring that patients are receiving appropriate care \n5  in an appropriate setting--frequently in a lower cost facility or setting.”  S. Rep. No. 744, \n6  90th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1967), reprinted at 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2866, 3029.  \nVI. \n7 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n8 \n9  A.  Community Services Provide A Better Quality Of Life \n10  149.  Plaintiffs and class members in this action have a variety of  developmental disabilities, \n11  including mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism.  Many plaintiffs have a “dual diagnosis,” \n12  meaning they have both a developmental disability and  a psychiatric diagnosis. \n13  150.  By definition, under the Lanterman Act, a develop mental disability manifests itself \n14  prior to the age of 18 and substantially limits a person’s functioning in one or more major life areas \n15  such as mobility, communication and/or basic daily living skills.  It is now well established that all \n16  people with developmental disabilities can learn—academically, vocationally, socially and \n17  otherwise—and that their learning advances most when done in integrated community settings.  It is \n18  also in integrated surroundings that people with developmental disabilities have t he fullest \n19  opportunity to exercise and apply their personal, social and work skills. \n20  151.  In recognition of this knowledge, California, pursuant to the Lanterman Act, has \n21  developed in the past four decades a system of community-based living options, day services and \n22  ancillary supports including specialized health services, transportation, behavioral and integration \n23  supports to serve people with developmental disabilities.  California, which, at one time, had a \n24  reputation as a pioneer among states in the development of community services for people with \n25  developmental disabilities now lags behind the nation in the provision of community services.  \n26  152.  While California still operates seven public institutions for people with developmental \n27  disabilities – the DCs – several of which are among the nation’s largest, at least ten other states have \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 37 \n \n\n \n1  expanded their community services sufficiently in the last decade to close all of their state \n2  institutions for people with developmental disabilities.  \n3  153.  Current research and practice have shown that persons with developmental disabilities \n4  can, with appropriate support, live in integrated community settings.  Professional researchers who \n5  study what happens to the quality of life of people with developmental disabilities when they move \n6  from large congregate care settings to community living have consistently concluded that people are \n7  better off when they leave large congregate care settings for community living in small, family -scale \n8  homes. When properly staffed and supported, these programs provide a level of service far superior \n9  to segregated institutions.  People with developmental disabilities develop independence, \n10  occupational skills, and an enhanced sense of self worth when they live among other people without \n11  disabilities, and are able themselves to live, work and participate as members of their communities.   \n12  154.  The experiences of several states, including California, have shown that the needs of \n13  people with severe developmental disabilities, including those with severe physical, behavio ral and \n14  medical needs, can be safely and adequately met in integrated, community-based settings.  \n15  Nationwide, empirical studies, including studies conducted in California by defendants and their \n16  agents, of what happens to institutional residents when they  move to appropriate community settings \n17  show that people with severe needs gain the most from individually -structured community services. \n18  155.  DDS and regional center defendants and their executive staff have admitted that \n19  people with developmental disabilities should be served in the most integrated setting possible and \n20  that, with proper supports, almost all of the people in the DCs would do well in a smaller community \n21  setting.  \n22  156.  As a result of the 1994 settlement of a previous class action lawsuit, Coffelt, et al. v. \n23  DDS, et al., San Francisco Superior Court No. 91640, state agencies and regional centers (who are \n24  also defendants in this case), made efforts at moving people out of and deflecting people from \n25  admission to the DCs, resulting in a net reduction in the  DC population of 2,452 people between the \n26  years 1993 and 1998.  The individuals who moved from the DCs to the community during the \n27  Coffelt term included persons with the full spectrum of disabilities and severity of disability.   \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 38 \n \n\n \n1  157.  The Coffelt settlement was funded by over $334 million of additional federal funds \n2  generated by expansion of California’s Medicaid developmental disability home and community-\n3  based waiver. \n4  158.  A multi-year longitudinal research study of the people who moved from the DCs to the \n5  community and those who moved to alternative community living arrangements demonstrated a \n6  significant improvement in quality of life.  Center for Outcome Analysis Studies, 1994-2000, \n7  Berkeley Planning Associates Study, 1997.  \n8 \nB.  Thousands of Californians with Developmental Disabilities Are \nUnnecessarily Institutionalized \n9 \n10  159.  In June 1998, at the end of the Coffelt settlement period, DDS documents indicated \n11  2,214 of the approximately 3900 DC residents were recommended and waiting for movement to \n12  community homes.  Yet, in Fiscal Years 1998/99 and 1999/00, only 144 and 125 DC residents \n13  moved to community homes while 158 and 165 people, were respectively, admitted to the DCs in \n14  those years. The net population of the DCs was slightly lowered only because of the deaths of people  \n15  residing in the DCs. In Fiscal Year 2000/01 the regional centers had a placement goal of 200 people, \n16  but only 128 people moved and 115 were admitted to the DCs.   \n17  160.  In December 1999, DDS documents indicated that 1,528 of the 3,852 DC residents \n18  were still recommended and waiting for movement to community homes.  Plaintiffs allege, on \n19  information and belief, that the decrease in community recommendations since 1998 is based not on \n20  the needs and choices of the individual residents but, rather, on the lack of a m andate from DDS, on \n21  inadequate individualized IPP planning by regional centers and DC staff, and/or a lack of sufficient \n22  fiscal resources for the development of quality community living arrangements and ancillary \n23  supports. \n24  161.  On information and belief, there are many DC residents throughout the state who have \n25  had writs granted, pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code sections 4800 -4801, ordering their \n26  release to appropriate community living arrangements; however, they remain in the DCs because \n27  their regional centers have not located or developed the needed services.  \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 39 \n \n\n \n1  162.  For Fiscal Year 2001/02, the regional centers’ collective goal for moving people from \n2  the DCs to the community is only 243.  Each of the twenty-one regional centers was allowed by \n3  DDS to set its own placement goal, yet some regional centers that have over 100 of their clients \n4  residing in a DC set goals of moving 5 or fewer people to the community.   Four months into the \n5  2001/02 Fiscal Year, only 55 DC residents have moved out and, at the same time, 7 7 others have \n6  been admitted to the DCs. \n7  163.  The vast majority of institutionalized individuals with developmental disabilities could \n8  and would choose to live in small homes in natural communities if quality supports and services \n9  were available to them.  On information and belief data show that: \n10  a)  Approximately 3,730 people live in the seven DCs. While most of the people who \n11  reside in the DCs have severe disabilities, there are many more people living successfully in \n12  the community with disabilities of equal severity.  \n13  b)  Approximately 1,000 people live in skilled nursing facilities, including \n14  approximately 100 children.   \n15  c)  Over 1,200 live in Intermediate Care Facilities – Developmentally Disabled (ICF-\n16  DDs) which house over 16 and often 50 to 100 people. \n17  d)  Many hundreds live in Community Care Facilities (CCFs) that house over 16 and \n18  often 50 to 100 people.  \n19  e)  Many individuals are inappropriately sent to acute psychiatric hospitals and/or \n20  remain in such settings long beyond the time when it is medically appropriate.  \n21  f)  Minors with developmental disabilities who are wards of the state often end up in \n22  children’s shelters which cannot meet their needs. \n23  164.  The unnecessary segregation and isolation of people with disabilities in these \n24  institutions severely diminishes their everyday life activities, including family relations, social \n25  contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment. \n26  165.  On information and belief, well over 400 hundred more people with developmental \n27  disabilities are “at risk” of institutionalization each year due to the lack of community services and \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 40 \n \n\n \n1  crisis intervention supports which could meet their challenging needs. Many of those \"at risk\" end up \n2  in institutions.  \n3  166.  State and regional center defendants and their executive staff ha ve failed to carry out \n4  professional recommendations and, in some instances, court orders for movement to the community \n5  and discharge from institutions because adequate numbers and varieties of appropriate community \n6  services are unavailable.  \n7  C.  Inadequate Individualized Planning \n8  167.  On information and belief, far greater numbers of individuals would be referred by \n9  their IPP teams for movement from public and private institutions to small integrated community \n10  homes if the assessment and planning process was conducted in compliance with the Lanterman Act \n11  and other laws. \n12  168.  On information and belief, IPP planning teams at the DCs do not conduct IPPs \n13  consistently with the standards of the Lanterman Act and the state and federal anti -discrimination \n14  laws and constitutions.  For example: \n15  a)  Individuals frequently are not provided with information in an understandable \n16  form (including experiential information) on the variety of possible community living \n17  options; \n18  b)  Many IPP teams discuss the issue in terms of the individual’s “readin ess” to live \n19  in the community rather than appropriately assessing the services and supports the individual \n20  would need to live successfully in the community;  \n21  c)  In spite of the clear Lanterman Act mandate, regional center service coordinators \n22  attend IPP meetings in the DCs less than 50% of the time even where the regional center is \n23  also the conservator; \n24  d)  Partially as a result of the absence of regional center representatives, there is often \n25  no professional at the IPP meeting with an understanding of the scope and variety of \n26  community living options; \n27  e)  In violation of the April 2000 injunction in  Richard S et al. v. DDS et al. v. Bell, \n28  et al, Federal District Court for the Central District of California (SACV 97-219-GLT), many \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 41 \n \n\n \n1  individuals in the DCs are not seriously considered for movement to a community home \n2  because of objections from their family members; \n3  f)  Even when the IPP team does recommend movement to the community, an \n4  adequate individualized discussion of the services and support the individual prefers and \n5  needs upon movement is often not conducted and the individual is simply slated for \n6  movement to a certain category of existing services.  \n7  169.  On information and belief, IPP planning teams for residents of private and non-state \n8  operated public institutions also do not conduct IPP meetings consistently with requirements of state \n9  and federal law.  For example: \n10  a)  Individualized assessments of the non-institutional services which could support a \n11  person are not conducted; \n12  b)  Individuals are not meaningfully informed of their right to choose integrated less-\n13  restrictive community supports and/or HCB waiver services; and \n14  c)  When it appears there is no readily available non-institutional alternative, \n15  consideration is not given to developing innovative alternatives or expanding existing \n16  services that could meet the person’s needs and choices.  \n17  170.  As a result of the inadequate individualized IPP process, many people are not \n18  recommended for movement to a community home and/or fail to understand their rights to choose to \n19  move to a community home and/or are moved to living arrangements that are not the least restrictive \n20  and most integrated. \n21  D.  Lack Of An Adequate Array Of Community Services \n22  171.  Defendants’ policies, practices and underfunding have resulted in a community service \n23  system which cannot meet its mandate to provide a sufficient array of quality community living \n24  arrangements responsive to the individualized needs and choices of people with developmental \n25  disabilities.  Nor is there adequate availability of needed ancillary supports such as hea lth and mental \n26  health care, meaningful quality day programs and crisis services.  This lack of services appears to be \n27  most acute for children and adolescents with behavioral challenges, people with dual diagnoses and \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 42 \n \n\n \n1  people with health care needs.  As a re sult, people are needlessly institutionalized or at risk of \n2  institutionalization.  For example: \n3  a)  When a person needs community services not currently available in his/her \n4  regional center’s geographic area, the regional centers frequently conduct fruitless “ statewide \n5  searches” and then institutionalize the individuals.  Instead, regional centers should issue \n6  requests to local providers to modify or expand their service capacity to provide the needed \n7  services. \n8  b)  The lack of mandated crisis services, which can assist people to remain in their \n9  current living arrangements, frequently results in individuals being inappropriately taken to \n10  county-run psychiatric hospitals where they often remain institutionalized for prolonged \n11  periods without medical justification. \n12  c)  There is a dearth of homes for people with dual diagnoses.  No higher rates for \n13  such homes have been set in spite of statutory authority.  Nor is there adequate cooperation \n14  between community mental health agencies and regional centers.  Moreover, DDS and DMH \n15  have failed to collaborate and provide technical assistance when requested by local agencies \n16  as mandated by the Lanterman Act.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4696.1(c). \n17  172.  The population of California’s state institutions for people with developmental \n18  disabilities (the DCs) tends to be persons with severe disabilities.  Similarly, the people with \n19  developmental disabilities who reside in private skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and psychiatric \n20  hospitals tend to be people with severe disabilities.  The residents of these institutions remain \n21  isolated because defendants have not developed a sufficient number of appropriate small community \n22  living arrangements with the services and supports to meet their needs and have not developed the \n23  needed ancillary supports in the community, e.g., medication management, nursing supports, and \n24  mental health services for the dually-diagnosed. \n25  173.  Many community residential providers are unable to successfully serve people with \n26  severe disabilities because they are unable to pay wages and benefits which attract staff who are \n27  competent and trained to provide supervision, treatment and support to people with severe \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 43 \n \n\n \n1  disabilities.  Under defendants’ current system, persons with severe disabilities often remain isolated \n2  in large institutions, or are at great risk of being placed into institutions. \n3  174.  DDS and many regional center defendants and their executive staff have admitted that \n4  existing community services do not have the capacity to serve adequately all of the people now \n5  institutionalized in California. \n6  175.  Defendant regional centers have publicly admitted they are unable to develop needed \n7  crisis, medical, dental, psychiatric, day program and residential options.  E.g., Association of \n8  Regional Centers Agencies, Planning for a Unified Developmental Disabilities Service System, \n9  2000. \n10  E.  The Developmental Disabilities System is Funded by Both State General \nFunds and Title XIX Medicaid Funds  \n11 \n12  176.  The Lanterman Act entitlement to services is funded by a combination of state general \n13  fund dollars and federal financial reimbursements through regular Title XIX Medi-Cal funds and \n14  through Title XIX home and community-based waivers and other sources.  Services in institutions \n15  and in the community receive federal financial participation through Medicaid.  For example, on \n16  information and belief: \n17  a)  Services in the DCs are funded approximately 50% by state general fund dollars \n18  which are in DDS’ budget and 50% by Medicaid reimbursements so long as the DCs are \n19  certified by CMS; \n20  b)  Services in both the large congregate ICF-DDs and SNFs and in family-scale ICF-\n21  DD/Hs and ICF-DD/Ns are funded 50% by state general fund dollars which are in DHS’ \n22  budget and 50% by Medicaid reimbursements; \n23  c)  Community services, including small community care facilities, supported living, \n24  day programs and many ancillary services can be funded either by 100% state general fund \n25  dollars or by 50/50 general fund and Medicaid home and community-based waiver dollars.  \n26  The general fund dollars that regional centers use to purchase services go through the DDS \n27  budget; and \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 44 \n \n\n \n1  d)  Regional center service coordination activities are funded by 50/50 general funds \n2  and Medicaid targeted case management funds. \n3  177.  Defendant DHS, as the single state agency responsible to the federal government \n4  (CMS) on how California administers its Medi-Cal program including home and community-based \n5  (HCB) waivers, has the authority to request additional waivers or expansion of current HCB waivers.  \n6  178.  The HCB waiver services currently available under the Medi-Cal program which are \n7  most relevant for people with developmental disabilities are: \n8  a)  Developmental Disability (DD) Waiver for which Medi-Cal eligible individuals \n9  who have a developmental disability may qualify if they require Intermediate Care Facility \n10  for Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR) level of care which includes I CF/MR units at the DCs and \n11  ICF-DDs.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22 § 51343, et seq.  A five year DD waiver was approved \n12  by CMS with a rising population cap from 45,094 in 2001 to 50,754 in 2006.  DHS has an \n13  agreement with DDS so that DDS and the regional centers are responsible for the day-to-day \n14  administration of the DD Waiver.  DHS regularly reviews how the DD Waiver is being \n15  administered locally to insure federal requirements are being met.  \n16  b)  Nursing Facility (NF) Waiver for which Medi-Cal eligible individuals qualify if \n17  they:  (i) would otherwise require nursing facility level of care for at least 90 consecutive \n18  days; (ii) are over age 65 or disabled; and (iii) have a physical disability.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. \n19  22 § 51344(c).   \n20  179.  On information and belief, at present there are 14,165 open places on the DD Waiver \n21  which could be used by plaintiff class members moving from institutions, or at risk of \n22  institutionalization.  However, there is a lack of available community resources so individuals \n23  eligible for and desiring waiver services remain in institutions. \n24  180.  On information and belief, the current NF Waiver approved by CMS can serve only \n25  500 people and all of the places are filled.  The NF Waiver serves many individuals outside the \n26  developmental disabilities system as well as those within.  The approximately 2,000 regional center \n27  clients who live in either NF units at the DCs or private SNFs have no current waiver places \n28  available. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 45 \n \n\n \n1  181.  On information and belief, community-based services, whether funded with state \n2  dollars or waiver dollars, are more cost-effective than institutional care. \n3  182.  On information and belief, California ranks 49th in its per capita expenditures for the \n4  provision of home and community-based “waiver” services and 48th in its total provision of home \n5  care.  \n6  183.  California’s waiver expenditures per beneficiary were the lowest in the nation at an \n7  average of $21,356 during 2000. \n8  F.  Disproportionate Allocation of Funds on Institutional Care \n9  184.  On information and belief, California provides over three billion dollars annually to \n10  institutionalize people with disabilities, including people with developmental disabilities, at great \n11  human and economic cost to the state.  \n12  185.  California spends a mere 20% of its overall Medicaid lo ng-term care dollars on home \n13  and community-based care, with the vast majority of money supporting institutional care.  \n14  186.   California serves approximately 170,000 people in its community services system for \n15  people with developmental disabilities as compared to the approximately 3800 people who are \n16  served in the seven DCs. Yet, on information and belief, approximately 25% of California's \n17  developmental disabilities budget goes to the 2% of the people in the DCs.   \n18  187.  On information and belief, in Fiscal Year 2001/2002, California spends $169,646 on \n19  average per resident per year in the DCs.  The average expenditure for a person living in the \n20  community is less than one-sixth of this amount. \n21  188.  Direct care staff in the DCs are state civil service employees.  On information  and \n22  belief, in 1999, the average annual salary for a community direct care worker in California was \n23  $18,500, while the annual salary for direct care workers in the DCs ranges from $36,000 to $52,000.  \n24  Moreover, in the last two years, when unemployment was  at a low in California, defendants \n25  provided newly recruited and hired workers at several DCs permanent \"recruitment and retention\" \n26  bonuses of $300 to $700 dollars a month on top of the state pay scale.  Defendants also offered two-\n27  years of community college tuition.  No such bonuses, salary supplements or education benefits have \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 46 \n \n\n \n1  been made available by defendants to attract workers in the community, even in high cost areas such \n2  as Silicon Valley.   \n3  189.  The low wages and lack of benefits for direct service worker s results from the \n4  underfunding of the community system by defendants.  In turn, the low uncompetitive wages and \n5  lack of benefits makes it difficult for community service providers to recruit and retain qualified, \n6  competent staff to support people with developmental disabilities.  On information and belief, staff \n7  turnover in community services averages 50% and ranges up to 100%.  High staff turnover yields \n8  instability and contributes to a lack of quality and the inability of services to address the needs of  \n9  those with the most challenging disabilities. \n10  190.  The condition of the physical plants at the five older DCs is deteriorating.  Vanir \n11  Construction Management, a private consultant under contract to DDS, issued a report in 1998 \n12  indicating that it would require $1.4 billion to bring the DCs into compliance with life, safety and \n13  health requirements, seismic safety and ADA accessibility mandates.  Even if brought up to code, \n14  significant ongoing funding would be needed to maintain these old facilities.  On informat ion and \n15  belief, in Fiscal Year 2001/2002, $27 million was appropriated for DC infrastructure needs.  \n16  191.  Pursuant to Budget Trailer bill language enacted as part of the Fiscal Year 2000/01 \n17  budget, DDS was required to issue a report to the Legislature by March 1 , 2001 identifying a range \n18  of options to meet the future needs of individuals currently served by, or who will need services \n19  similar to those provided in, the DCs.  Stats. 2000, Ch.93, § 104. \n20  192.  Following issuance of the Vanir Report and in response to the Tr ailer bill language, \n21  DDS convened a task force made up of stakeholders from all parts of the system (e.g., consumers \n22  and family from the DCs and community, regional centers, DC staff and unions, advocates, \n23  community service providers) to address the need to develop alternatives to current state institutional \n24  services.  DDS put forward five principles upon which to proceed with restructuring DC services, as \n25  follows: \n26  a)  No major capital outlays to rebuild DCs; \n27  b)  People will live in homes of 4 persons or less; \n28  c)  Capture and extend DC resources into the community; \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 47 \n \n\n \n1  d)  Leverage the proceeds from the sale of DC lands to create new resources in the \n2  system; \n3  e)  Conduct highly individualized personal assessments and resource development \n4  before a person moves to the community.  \n5  193.  The March 2001 report required by the Legislature has not been issued.  On \n6  information and belief, the report was completed by DDS and submitted to defendant DHS and/or \n7  defendant CHHS; however, either DHS or CHHS has stopped its issuance.   \n8  194.  Defendants DDS and Allenby and DDS’ executive staff have admitted that more \n9  people could move out of the DCs to community settings if the developmental disabilities system \n10  had more resources.  Plaintiffs allege that restructuring DC services and leveraging the resources \n11  from the sale of DC lands, as initially proposed by DDS and approved by the system stakeholders, \n12  would create such additional resources from within the developmental disabilities system. \n13  G.  Underfunding of the Community System  \n14  195.  The need for additional community resources is clear.  Studies of the community \n15  service system by the California Bureau of State Audits and by private consultants to the defendants \n16  have found that the system is underfunded. \n17  196.  In 1998, the Legislature required DDS, in collaboration with system stakeholders, to \n18  review the service delivery system and make recommendations to, inter alia, improve the quality of \n19  services, maximize cost effectiveness while emphasizing quality, variety and flexib ility in the \n20  delivery of services and develop performance-based consumer-outcome driven rate systems.  Welf. \n21  & Inst. Code §§ 4690.4 and 4697.  The process established by DDS to implement this mandate came \n22  to be known as “Service Delivery Reform.”  DDS, regional centers, consumers, families, service \n23  providers and advocates met many times over more than two years to review the service delivery \n24  system.  However, the process had stalled and new rate systems effectively linking funding to the \n25  achievement of consumer outcomes have not been put in place.  Nor have other elements of Service \n26  Delivery Reform such as improved quality assurance, personal outcomes evaluation and revised \n27  service and staff requirements been operationalized. \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 48 \n \n\n \n1  197.  In Fiscal Year 2001/2002, there were no rate increases for community providers of \n2  developmental disabilities services. \n3  198.  In spite of legislative mandates and the variations in cost levels around California, \n4  geographic differentials in rates have never been implemented. \n5  199.  Regional center operations are also underfunded meaning, inter alia, that service \n6  coordination, which is central to the Lanterman Act process, is not provided effectively.  \n7  200.  On information and belief, defendants DOF and acting Director Genest have exercised \n8  their budgetary authority in an manner which hinders and/or prevents state agency defendants \n9  CHHS, DHS and DDS and their Directors and regional center defendants from fulfilling their legal \n10  obligations under the Lanterman Act, state and federal anti-discrimination laws, Title XIX, and the \n11  State and Federal Constitutions. \n12  201.  Community services will remain more cost-effective than institutional care even if \n13  regional center allocations and service provider rates are raised.  On information and belief, other \n14  states which have deinstitutionalized successfully have spent 80% of the cost of institutional care to \n15  serve previously institutionalized people in the community.  California spends only about 50%. \n16  H.  California Has Not Developed An Olmstead Plan \n17  202.  The plaintiff class members in this action include people who are fully able to “handle \n18  and benefit from community settings,” Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), but are retained in \n19  institutions or at risk of institutionalization because of inadequate assessments of their needs and/or \n20  inadequate person-centered planning and because stable, quality community living arrangements and \n21  the necessary array of ancillary supports are not available to them.  \n22  203.  In the Olmstead decision, the United States Supreme Court suggested that one way \n23  states could demonstrate compliance with the ADA integration mandate is by developing  a \n24  comprehensive, effective plan to  move people with disabilities who do not require \n25  institutionalization into the community at a reasonable pace.  \n26  204.  In a series of letters beginning in January 2000, the federal Secretary of Health and \n27  Human Services and the Directors of the Health Care Financing Administration (now CMS) and the \n28  Office of Civil Rights wrote to State Governors and Medicaid Directors challenging them to \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 49 \n \n\n \n1  undertake Olmstead planning and offering a variety of technical assistance and incentives to the \n2  states. \n3  205.  CAIC and California Arc, plaintiffs in this action, joined with other advocacy \n4  organizations in California in writing to and meeting with representatives of the Governo r, the \n5  state’s Long Term Care Council and DDS, asking them to take action to implement  Olmstead. \n6  206.  In May 2003, State defendants issued what is purported to be an  Olmstead plan; \n7  however, it does not meet the requirements for such a plan as contemplated by ei ther the Olmstead \n8  case or CMS in that it is not comprehensive and does not include reasonable timelines for assessing \n9  all people with developmental disabilities in institutions or for moving those people who are \n10  unnecessarily institutionalized into integrated, community-based settings.  Moreover, much of the \n11  plan is conditional and only selected provisions are being implemented.  As a result, State \n12  defendants have yet to comply with  Olmstead.  \n13  207.  The regional center defendants in 2000, through the Association of Regional Center \n14  Agencies, adopted a Strategic Plan for a Unified System which embraces the concepts of the \n15  Olmstead decision; however, they cannot implement the plan without actions and funding from the \n16  State defendants. \n17  VII. \n18  STATE ACTION \n19  208.  Defendants State, CHHS, DDS, DHS, DOF, DMH, Belshé, Allenby, Bontá, and \n20  Genest are all state entities, state officials, or agents or employees of the state.  State defendants’ \n21  actions with respect to the actions and omissions complained of herein are within the scope of their \n22  authority as state employees and officials and are thereby under color of state law.    \n23  209.  Defendant regional centers are, by statutory mandate, responsible for providing \n24  support and services to people with developmental disabilities within the communities of this state, \n25  an area that has traditionally been a governmental function.  The regional centers have no \n26  independent existence apart from the state; rather through contract, funding, extensive regulation and \n27  legislative oversight the state has insinuated itself into a position of such interdependence that the \n28  regional centers may be fairly treated as the state itself for purposes of state action.   \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 50 \n \n\n \n1  VIII. \n2  ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n3  210.  Defendants' actions, as alleged herein, have resulted in, and will continue to result in \n4  irreparable injury to plaintiffs and class members caused by their unnecessary isolation and \n5  segregation in institutions and the denial of appropriate, quality community living arrangements and \n6  ancillary supports to which they are entitled.  Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at \n7  law. \n8  211.  An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants, in that plaintiffs claim \n9  that defendants have violated their rights under t he Lanterman Act, the ADA, and other state and \n10  federal anti-discrimination laws, the State and Federal Constitutions, Title XIX of the Social \n11  Security Act and Business and Professions Code sections 17200, and defendants deny all such \n12  contentions. \n13  212.  Unless the requested relief is granted, the three organizational plaintiffs’ missions will \n14  be thwarted as set forth above, and plaintiffs and class members will be denied the services and \n15  supports that would allow them to live in their local communities.  Without t he availability of such \n16  services and supports, plaintiffs and class members will continue to live in unnecessarily restrictive \n17  institutional settings and suffer harm, including deprivation of personal autonomy and personal \n18  freedoms and of the opportunity to live more independent, productive and normal lives.  Taxpayer \n19  plaintiffs are and will continue to be injured by the unlawful expenditure of tax monies.  \n20  IX. \n21  ENTITLEMENT TO MANDAMUS RELIEF \n22  213.  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, respondents/defendants have the \n23  clear present and ministerial duty to act in accord with state and federal law and the United States \n24  and California Constitutions as set forth above.  Where respondents/defendants are lawfully required \n25  to exercise their discretion in carrying out their duties, respondents are bound to exercise such \n26  discretion within proper limits and under a correct interpretation of the law.  Common Cause of \n27  California v. Board of Supervisors, 49 Cal. 3d 432, 442 (1989) (“[m]andamus may issue [] to \n28  compel an official both to exercise his discretion (if he is required by law to do so) and to exercise it \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 51 \n \n\n \n1  under a proper interpretation of the applicable law.”);  Young v. Gannon, 97 Cal. App. 4th 209, 221 \n2  (2002) (“[w]here a public official is required by law to exercise his or her discretion, mandamus will \n3  lie to compel the official to exercise his or her discretion under a proper interpretation of the law.”)    \n4  The responsibilities and duties of respondents/defendants which are subject to mandamus relief \n5  include, but are not limited to, ensuring that the plaintiff class receives services in the least \n6  restrictive, most integrated community settings, performing adequate assessments and person-\n7  centered IPP meetings to determine the least restrictive, most integrated comm unity settings for \n8  plaintiffs, giving adequate information to plaintiffs regarding their choice of services, and providing \n9  adequate funding to develop a sufficient number of quality community services necessary to meet \n10  the needs and choices of people with all types and levels of disability, all as required by the \n11  Lanterman Act, the ADA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Government Code section 11135, \n12  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the State and Federal Constitutions, and Business and \n13  Professions Code section 17200.  Although respondents have had and currently have the capacity \n14  and ability to discharge their duties, as set forth above, in a manner consistent with all applicable \n15  state and federal laws and the California and United States Constitutions, respondents have failed \n16  and refused to do so and/or abused their discretion in performance of such duties, and/or exercised \n17  their discretion under an improper interpretation of the law.  \n18  214.  Petitioners have no plain speedy and adequate remedy at law for r espondents’ actions \n19  complained of above.  \n20  215.  Petitioners and each of them are beneficially interested in respondents’ discharge of \n21  their obligations as set forth herein and suffer irreparable injury from defendants’ failure to discharge \n22  their obligations. \n23  X. \n24  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n25  (Violation of Lanterman Act Entitlement To Non-Institutional Community Living \n26  Arrangements Based On Individual Need) \n27  216.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n28  217.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against all defendants. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 52 \n \n\n \n1  218.  The individual plaintiffs and class members are people with developmental disabilities \n2  as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 4512(a) and are consumers of a specific regional \n3  center defendant. \n4  219.  The Lanterman Act charges the regional center defendants with responsibility for \n5  providing service coordination and securing services and supports for people with developmental \n6  disabilities.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4640 et seq.  The regional center defendants are responsible for \n7  assessing each consumer’s needs and developing and implementing individual program plans \n8  (\"IPPs\") which are individually-tailored to meet those needs by,  inter alia, securing the services and \n9  supports each individual needs to be integrated int o the mainstream of community life.  Welf. & Inst. \n10  Code §§ 4646 - 4648.1.  Defendants DDS and Allenby are responsible for ensuring that the \n11  Lanterman Act is fully implemented and that regional centers provide services in compliance with \n12  the requirements and principles of the Lanterman Act (e.g., Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4416, 4434, \n13  4500.5,4620 and 4629). \n14  220.  State defendant DDS is the operator of the developmental centers (\"DCs\") (Welf. & \n15  Inst. Code § 4400, et seq.), and thus is responsible for providing direct care and services to persons \n16  with developmental disabilities who reside in DCs.  In this capacity, DDS is jointly -responsible with \n17  regional center defendants for assessing each DC resident’s needs and for developing and \n18  implementing IPPs which are individually-tailored to meet those needs.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n19  §§ 4418.3, 4646, 4646.5.  With respect to DC residents and individuals at risk of placement in the \n20  DCs, however, defendant DDS and the DDS-administered Regional Resource Development \n21  Programs (RRDPs) often fail to develop IPPs recommending community placement and/or \n22  identifying the community services and supports which would allow DC residents and individuals at \n23  risk to avoid DC placement to successfully live in less restrictive settings.    \n24  221.  With respect to residents of non-DC institutions, and people at-risk of placement in \n25  non-DC institutions, DDS has failed to adequately assist and monitor regional centers to ensure that \n26  they fulfill their responsibilities under the Lanterman Act, including their compliance with the \n27  mandate that consumers be afforded opportunities to live and remain in the least restrictive setting.   \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 53 \n \n\n \n1  222.  State defendants CHHS, DHS, DMH and DOF have directly and/or indirectly impeded \n2  DDS and regional center efforts to fulfill their responsibilities to prevent unnecessary \n3  institutionalization and enable class members to live in non-institutional settings. \n4  A.  DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE STATE DEFENDANTS FOR \nVIOLATIONS OF THE LANTERMAN ACT. \n5 \n223.  The State defendants, including DDS, in DDS’s capacity as the dep artment within the \n6 \nCHHS Agency with responsibility for implementing and ensuring regional center compliance with \n7 \nthe Lanterman Act, and as the operator of the DCs, have violated specific ministerial duties set forth \n8 \nin the Lanterman Act.  Additionally, the  State defendants have violated numerous other sections of \n9 \nthe Lanterman Act by exercising their discretion under an improper interpretation of the law.  \n10 \n/// \n11 \n/// \n12 \n1.  Violations of Ministerial Duties.  \n13 \n{The allegations in Paragraph 224(a)-(f) have been dismissed by the Court.  \n14 \nThese allegations are included to preserve Plaintiffs' right to seek appellate review of the \n15 \ndismissal of these allegations.} \n16 \n224.  The State defendants have violated ministerial duties set forth in the Lanterman Act by \n17 \ntheir policies, practices, actions and omissions including, but not limited to: \n18 \na.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to conduct required activities to deflect \n19 \nclass members from placement in DCs.  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.7(b) \n20 \nrequires the RRDPs, which are administered and staffed by State defendant DDS, to perform \n21 \nthree ministerial tasks whenever a regional center provides notice that a community \n22 \nplacement is at risk of failing and admission to a DC is a likelihood.  The RRDPs shall:  (1) \n23 \nimmediately arrange for an assessment of the situation; (2) attend an emergency IPP planning \n24 \nteam meeting to discuss additional supports and services; and (3) follow up with the regional \n25 \ncenter as to the success of any recommended interventions.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n26 \nbelieve that State defendant DDS, in its capacity as the administrator of the RRDPs, has \n27 \nviolated Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.7(b) by failing to arrange for immediate \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 54 \n \n\n \n1  assessments and attend emergency planning meetings, and by failing to follow up with \n2  regional centers as to the success of any recommended interventions;  \n3  b.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to make available aggregate data on the \n4  outcomes of efforts to assist at-risk consumers to remain in the community and on regional \n5  center performance under their Community Placement Plans (\"CPPs\").  Welfare and \n6  Institutions Code sections 4418.25 (c) and 4418.7(d), respectively, mandate that State \n7  defendant DDS \"shall” collect and make available upon request aggregate data on regional \n8  center performance under their CPPs and on implementation of the deflection requirements \n9  of section 4418.7.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendant DDS has violated \n10  sections 4418.25(c) and 4418.7(d) by failing to collect and/or make available aggregate data \n11  on these matters; \n12  c.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to monitor and assist the regional centers to \n13  ensure they fulfill their responsibilities under the Lanterman Act.  Welfare and Institutions \n14  Code sections 4434(b), 4434(c), 4434(d), 4629, 4635 and 4651(b), among others, set forth \n15  State defendants' mandatory responsibility to monitor, assist and support the regional centers \n16  in complying with their contracts and the provisions of the Lanterman Act.   These sections \n17  of the Lanterman Act -- viewed together, as required by California law, and/or viewed \n18  separately -- give rise to a ministerial duty on the part of State defendant DDS to \n19  communicate regularly with regional centers, to respond to regional centers' requests for \n20  guidance and/or assistance, and to monitor regional centers’ compliance with the provisions \n21  of their contracts and the Lanterman Act.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n22  defendant DDS has violated sections 4434(b), 4434(c), 4434(d), 4629, 4635 and 4651(b) by \n23  failing to monitor and assist the regional centers;  \n24  d.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to hold individual planning meetings with \n25  the \"planning teams\" of plaintiff class members residing in the DCs as required by,  inter alia, \n26  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b)&(c), 4512(j), 4646, 4646.5 and 4647.  The \n27  Lanterman Act requires that a \"planning team\" jointly develop an individual program plan for \n28  every person eligible for regional center services.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4646(c) & 4646(d).  \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 55 \n \n\n \n1  The Lanterman Act defines the \"planning team\" as a group which includes \"one or more \n2  regional center representatives, including the designated regional center service coordinator.\"  \n3  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4512(j); see also Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4647(a) & 4646.5(b) \n4  (mandating regional center participation in the IPP process and setting forth planning team \n5  duties including periodic review of all IPPs.).  Welfare and Institutions Code sections \n6  4418.3(b) and 4418.3(c) make State defendant DDS responsible for convening planning team \n7  meetings for DC residents and ensuring that those planning teams develop IPPs consistent \n8  with the mandates of sections 4646 and 4646.5.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n9  defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b) and 4418.3(c) \n10  by routinely convening planning team meetings for DC residents that are not attended by one \n11  or more regional center representatives, including the designated regional center service \n12  coordinator;  \n13  e.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to collaborate for the care and treatment of \n14  persons with dual diagnoses as required by Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4510 and \n15  4681.1(d).  Section 4510 requires that State defendants DDS and DMH jointly develop and \n16  implement a statewide program for encouraging the establishment of sufficient numbers and \n17  types of living arrangements, including community living arrangements, to meet the needs of \n18  persons served by both departments.  In developing this program, State defendants DDS and \n19  DMH are commanded to consult with specific organizations and agencies, including the \n20  League of California Cities, the County Supervisors Association of California.  Welf. & Inst. \n21  Code § 4510.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendants DDS and DMH have \n22  violated section 4510 by failing to hold interagency meetings for developing a statewide \n23  program and by failing to consult with the organizations specified in subsections (a) through \n24  (c).  Section 4681.1(d) further requires that State defendants DDS and DMH \"shall\" work \n25  together to establish criteria upon which higher rates may be fixed for the provision of \n26  services and supports to dually diagnosed persons.  While State defendants DDS and DMH \n27  have limited discretion in establishing the ultimate criteria, the duty to meet and work \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 56 \n \n\n \n1  together to establish such criteria is ministerial.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n2  defendants DDS and DMH have failed to work together as required by section 4681.1(d);  \n3  f.  {Preserved For Appeal}  Failing to develop IPPs recommending community \n4  placement of DC residents over the objection of family members or conservators.  Welfare \n5  and Institutions Code section 4646(d) provides that family members and/or conservators may \n6  be included in the decision-making process, but commands that \"[i]ndividual program plans \n7  shall be prepared jointly by the planning team.\"  In addition, permitting family members or \n8  conservators to unilaterally veto community placement recommendations violates DC \n9  residents’ due process rights and the permanent injunction issued in  Richard S. et al. v. DDS \n10  et al. v. Bell et al. (U.S. District Court Case No. SACV 97-219-GLT; CD Cal. 2000).  State \n11  defendant DDS, by virtue of its participation on IPP planning teams for DC residents (Welf. \n12  & Inst. Code §§ 4418.3(c)), has a ministerial duty to ensure that IPPs are prepared jointly by \n13  the planning team.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendant DDS has violated \n14  section 4646(d) by permitting family members and conservators of DC residents to, in effect, \n15  unilaterally prevent community placement of DC residents who could live in less restrictive \n16  settings. \n17  2.  Violations of Statutory Requirements. \n18  225.  The Lanterman Act contains numerous individual provisions which grant the State \n19  defendants discretion in carrying out their duties thereunder.  California law requires that these \n20  individual provisions be construed in light of the overall purpose of the Lanterman Act statutory \n21  scheme.  See People v. Morris, 46 Cal. 3d 1, 16 (1988) (\"Statutory language should not be \n22  interpreted in isolation, but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part, \n23  in order to achieve harmony among the other parts\"); People v. Hammer, 30 Cal. 4th 756, 762-63 \n24  (2003) (Courts must \"harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the \n25  particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole\").  \n26  a.  The Integration Mandate Forms a Hard Boundary \nfor Acts of Discretion Set Forth in Specific Sections \n27  of the Lanterman Act. \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 57 \n \n\n \n1  226.  The paramount purpose of the Lanterman Act is  furthering the right of each person \n2  with developmental disabilities to be integrated into the community to the greatest extent possible.  \n3  The California Supreme Court has construed the Lanterman Act and found that “[t]he purpose of the \n4  statutory scheme is twofold:  to prevent or minimize the institutionalization of developmentally \n5  disabled persons and their dislocation from family and community, and to enable them to \n6  approximate the pattern of everyday living of nondisabled persons of the same age and to lead more \n7  independent and productive lives in the community.”  ARC, 38 Cal. 3d at 388.  Through the IPP \n8  process, “the developmentally disabled person on an individual basis receives, as an entitlement, \n9  services that enable him to live a more independent and  productive life in the community.”  Id. at \n10  392 (emphasis added). \n11  227.  The Lanterman Act’s core right to integration is set forth initially in sections 4501 and \n12  4502.  Through section 4501, the State of California accepts “responsibility for persons with \n13  developmental disabilities and an obligation to them which it must discharge.”   Section 4502 \n14  provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified person by reason of having a developmental disability shall \n15  be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n16  any program or activity, which receives public funds.”  Through section 4502, the Legislature grants \n17  persons with developmental disabilities the “right to treatment and habilitation services in the least \n18  restrictive environment.”  Id. § 4502(a).  Section 4502(b) further requires that “[t]o the maximum \n19  extent possible, treatment, services, and supports shall be provided in natural community settings.”  \n20  The California Supreme Court confirmed that “sections 4501 and 4502 clearly speak in terms of the \n21  responsibility of the state and the rights of persons with developmental disabilities.”  ARC, 38 Cal. \n22  3d at 393.  The Lanterman Act is replete with additional references to the requirement to promote \n23  integration into the mainstream of community life and to provide community-based services, \n24  including Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.25, 4418.3, 4418.7, 4500.5, 4501, 4502, \n25  4502.1, 4507, 4509, 4512(b), 4640.7, 4646(a), 4646.5 (a)(1)&(2), 4648(a)(1) & (2), 4685, 4688, \n26  4689, 4691, 4697, 4750, and 4790.  These provisions work together to form an integration mandate. \n27  “[T]he Act defines a basic right and a corresponding basic obligation:  the right which it grants to the \n28  developmentally disabled person is to be provided with services that enable him to live a more \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 58 \n \n\n \n1  independent and productive life in the community; the obligation which it imposes on the state is to \n2  provide such services.”  ARC. 38 Cal.3d at 392. \n3  228.  The Lanterman Act as a whole, and each of its individual provisions, mus t be \n4  construed liberally so as to give effect to the primary purpose of integration.  California courts agree \n5  that “remedial statutes such as the Lanterman Act must be liberally construed to effectuate the \n6  purposes for which they were enacted.”  Clemente v. Amundson, 60 Cal. App. 4th 1094, 1102 (1998); \n7  see also Hansen v. Department of Social Services, 193 Cal. App. 3d 283, 290 (1987) (holding that \n8  “laws governing welfare programs are to be liberally interpreted and actively enforced”);  California \n9  Association of Health Facilities v. Department of Health Services, 16 Cal. 4th 284, 295 (1997) (“a \n10  remedial statute . . . is to be liberally construed on behalf of the persons it is designed to protect.”).  \n11  229.  The Lanterman Act’s primary right to integration – as stated by the California \n12  Supreme Court and in sections 4501, 4502 and elsewhere in the Act – provides a hard boundary for \n13  any acts of discretion performed by the persons, agencies and/or others charged with carrying out its \n14  provisions.  Discretion must be exercised with the constant goal of preventing or minimizing \n15  institutionalization and enabling people with developmental disabilities to lead more integrated, \n16  independent and productive lives in the community.  As set forth below, the State defendants have \n17  violated specific statutes by failing to exercise their discretion under a proper interpretation of the \n18  Lanterman Act. \n19  b.  Liability of the State Defendants for Violation of \nStatutory Requirements.   \n20 \n230.  Plaintiffs allege that the State defendants, through their policies and practices, acts and \n21 \nomissions, have violated the Lanterman Act by carrying out their duties and obligations under an \n22 \nimproper interpretation of the Lanterman Act:  an interpretation that ignores the right of each person \n23 \nwith developmental disabilities to treatment and services in the least restrictive environment in \n24 \nwhich his or her needs can be accommodated.  See Welf. & Inst. Code § 4502(a); ARC, 38 Cal. 3d at \n25 \n393 (setting forth core \"rights\" and \"responsibilities\" of the Lanterman Act).  The State  defendants' \n26 \nviolations include, but are not limited to: \n27 \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 59 \n \n\n \n1  a.  Failing to ensure that IPPs are prepared with the constant goal of placing each \n2  resident of public and/or private institutions in the least restrictive environment in which his \n3  or her needs can be accommodated and deflecting individuals at risk from institutional \n4  placement.  The Lanterman Act states that IPPs “shall include” a statement of goals, based on \n5  the individual’s needs, preferences and life choices, and objectives “which should maximize \n6  opportunities for the consumer to . . . be part of community life in the areas of community \n7  participation, housing, work, school, and leisure . . ..”  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646.5(a)(2).  \n8  The IPP must include a schedule of the type and amount of services and sup ports to be \n9  purchased or otherwise obtained in order to achieve the IPP goals.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n10  § 4646.5(a)(4).  State defendant DDS is responsible for convening planning meetings and the \n11  preparing IPPs for residents of DCs, as described in section 4646 .5.  Welfare and Institutions \n12  Code section 4646(d) commands that IPPs \"shall be prepared jointly by the planning team.\" \n13  With respect to the preparation of IPPs for residents of State-operated DCs, \"[t]he planning \n14  team shall include developmental center staff knowledgeable about the service and support \n15  needs of the consumer.\"  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4418.3(c).  In addition to employing DC staff \n16  and RRDP staff who directly participate in the preparation of IPPs for DC residents and \n17  individuals at risk of DC placement, State defendant DDS has authority over the IPP \n18  preparation process for all regional center consumers by virtue of its duty to monitor the \n19  regional centers' compliance with the Lanterman Act and to support and assist the regional \n20  centers in carrying out their duties.  See Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4434, 4629, 4635 & 4651(b).  \n21  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendant DDS has violated Welfare and \n22  Institutions Code sections 4646 and 4646.5 by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder \n23  with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment;  \n24  b.  Failing to ensure that IPPs are modified to reflect court determinations that a \n25  DC is no longer the least restrictive appropriate placement in which the individual ’s needs \n26  can be accommodated and failing to ensure implementation of IPPs reflecting such court \n27  determinations.  Placements in DCs that are not voluntary must be pursuant to court order \n28  following a hearing meeting stringent due process requirements.  In re Hop, 29 Cal.3d 82 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 60 \n \n\n \n1  (1981).  When a court determines — either in reviewing a prior commitment order or in \n2  reviewing a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code \n3  sections 4800-4801 -- that a DC is no longer the least restricti ve appropriate placement in \n4  which a DC resident’s needs can be accommodated, the Lanterman Act requires that the IPP \n5  be modified to reflect the individual’s current needs.   E.g., Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646.5(b) \n6  (requiring that IPPs be modified as necessary in response to the persons achievement or \n7  changing needs).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that DDS has violated section \n8  4646.5(b), and its responsibility to ensure regional center compliance with state law (as \n9  provided in Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4416, 4418.25, 4434, 4620, 4629, 4635 \n10  and 4651(b)), by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with the constant goal of \n11  providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n12  c.  Failing to ensure the adequate assessment of community-integrated service \n13  and support options and failing to develop IPPs identifying the community services and \n14  supports which would allow individuals to move to or remain successfully living in less \n15  restrictive settings. The Lanterman Act requires that each resident’s IPP include an \n16  assessment, performed by qualified individuals, of the services which could support them in \n17  non-institutional, community settings.  Welf & Inst. Code §§ 4418.3, 4418.7, 4646.5, 4647 & \n18  4648 (a) (1).  While the regional centers are primarily responsible for assessing community-\n19  integrated service and support options, in the case of DC residents, State defendant DDS \n20  employs DC staff who convene planning meetings, conduct assessments and directly \n21  participate as members of IPP planning teams.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4418.3(c).  For \n22  individuals at risk of placement in the DCs, the DDS -administered RRDPs have \n23  responsibility for assessment, IPP development and follow-up until a consumer's living \n24  arrangement is stable.  Welf & Inst. Code §§ 4418.7.  Additionally, State defendant DDS has \n25  authority over these assessments and the IPP preparation process for all regional center \n26  consumers residing in institutions and for people at risk of placement in an institution by \n27  virtue of its duty to monitor the regional centers' compliance with the Lanterman Act and to \n28  support and assist the regional centers in carrying out their duties.  See Welf. & Inst. Code \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 61 \n \n\n \n1  §§ 4434, 4629, 4635 & 4651(b).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendant \n2  DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3, 4418.7, 4646, 4646.5, 4647 \n3  and 4648(a)(1) by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with the constant goal of \n4  providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n5  d.  With respect to DC residents, failing to develop IPPs recommending \n6  community placement and failing to implement IPP recommendations for community \n7  placement over the objection of family members or conservators.  The Lanterman Act \n8  requires that decisions of IPP planning teams be made \"jointly.\"  Welf. & Inst. Code \n9  § 4646(d).  Permitting conservators and family members of DC residents to, in effect, \n10  unilaterally prevent community placement of DC residents who could live in less restrictive \n11  settings is inconsistent with the Lanterman Act IPP process and the integration mandate.  In \n12  addition, permitting family members or conservators to unilaterally veto community \n13  placement recommendations violates DC residents’ due process rights and the permanent \n14  injunction issued in Richard S. et al. v. DDS et al. v. Bell et al. (U.S. District Court Case No. \n15  SACV 97-219-GLT; CD Cal. 2000).  State defendant DDS employs DC staff who convene \n16  planning meetings and directly participate in the preparation of IPPs as members of planning \n17  teams.  E.g., Welf. & Inst. Code § 4418.3(c).  Moreover, State defendant DDS has authority \n18  over the IPP preparation process at DCs as the entity that operates the DCs and by virtue of \n19  its duty to monitor the regional centers' compliance with the Lanterman Act and t o support \n20  and assist the regional centers in carrying out their duties.  See Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4434, \n21  4629, 4635 & 4651(b).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendant DDS has \n22  violated Welfare and Institutions Code section 4646(d) by failing to exercise its discretion \n23  thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive \n24  environment;  \n25  e.  Failing to afford class members the opportunity to make meaningful choices, \n26  including but not limited to choices regarding where and with whom they live.  The \n27  Lanterman Act requires that every public or private agency that serves persons with \n28  developmental disabilities shall provide those individuals with the opportunity to exercise \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 62 \n \n\n \n1  decision-making skills and make meaningful choices concerning their own lives.  Welf. & \n2  Inst. Code §§ 4418.3(d), 4502.1, 4646, 4646.5.  State defendant DDS deprives class members \n3  of these rights by, for example, failing to provide them with information in an understandable \n4  form, including experiential information, on the variety of possible alternatives to \n5  institutions.  Moreover, State defendant DDS, by virtue of its monitoring and support \n6  functions, has failed to ensure that regional centers meet these obligations.   See Welf. & Inst. \n7  Code §§ 4434, 4629, 4635 & 4651(b).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n8  defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(d), 4502.1, 4646 \n9  and 4646.5 by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with the constant goal of provi ding \n10  services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n11  f.  Depriving plaintiffs and the class they represent of the opportunity for \n12  integration into the mainstream of community life by failing to maintain sufficient quality, \n13  stable, community living arrangements and ancillary supports to adequately provide for the \n14  needs and choices of class members who currently reside in public and private institutions, \n15  and who are at risk of placement in an institutional setting. Welfare and Institutions Code \n16  sections 4418.25, 4418.5, 4512(b), 4513, 4648, 4651(b), 4652, 4677, 4669.2, 4680, 4685, \n17  4685.1, 4688, 4689, 4689.1, 4690, 4696, 4696.1 and 4787 provide for placement in \n18  community living arrangements, including home-based arrangements, provide for the \n19  development of innovative resources to meet consumers’ needs and require the State and \n20  regional center defendants to maintain, develop and adequately fund a sufficient array of \n21  quality, community living arrangements and ancillary supports to ensure that class members  \n22  can be served in least restrictive community settings.  When necessary to expand the \n23  availability of needed services, regional centers may, for example, solicit providers through \n24  requests for proposals, request funds for the start-up costs of new services and use creative \n25  service delivery models.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4648 (e) & 4418.25.  With the approval of \n26  DDS, regional centers may develop service delivery alternatives outside the confines of other \n27  provisions of law.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4669.2.  Additionally, DDS may “where there are \n28  identified gaps in the system of services and supports or where there are identified consumers \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 63 \n \n\n \n1  for whom no provider will provide services and supports contained in his or her individual \n2  program plan” provide the supports directly.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(g).  Plaintiffs are \n3  informed and believe that State defendant DDS does not make use of community service \n4  models, and does not ensure that defendant regional centers fully and effectively utilize \n5  available community service models, expand the availability of current service models and \n6  develop new and innovative resources, which would enable class members to live \n7  successfully in non-institutional settings.  Thus, plaintiffs are informed and believe that the \n8  State defendants have violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.25, 4418.5, \n9  4512(b), 4513, 4648, 4651(b), 4652, 4677, 4669.2, 4680, 4685, 4685.1, 4688, 4689, 4689.1, \n10  4690, 4696, 4696.1 and 4787 by failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the \n11  constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment;  \n12  g.  Failing to fully and effectively obtain and utilize community-based waiver \n13  services for those class members eligible for such services.  State defendants DDS, DHS and \n14  CHHS are responsible for identifying and maximizing utilization of federal funding and other \n15  sources of funding for community-based services, including utilizing community-based \n16  waiver services for eligible class members.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4651(b), 4659, 4683, \n17  4780.  Though the State defendants have limited discretion in making use of available \n18  funding sources, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State defendants DDS, DHS and \n19  CHHS have violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4651, 4659, 4683 and 4780 by \n20  failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and \n21  supports in the least restrictive environment; \n22  h.  Failing to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to deflect people at risk of \n23  institutionalization from placement in an institution.  Welfare and Institutions Code section \n24  4418.25(b) makes State defendant DDS responsible for approval and monitoring of \n25  community placement plans which ensure \"deflection of selected individuals from \n26  developmental center placement.\"  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.7(b) states \n27  State defendant DDS  “shall” ensure that regional centers provide needed services and \n28  supports on an emergency basis. Additionally, Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4434, \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 64 \n \n\n \n1  4629, 4635 and 4651(b) make State defendant DDS responsible for monitoring and \n2  supporting the regional centers in ensuring that all consumers receive adequate assessments, \n3  crisis services and supplemental supports as required by Welfare and Institutions Code \n4  sections 4646, 4646.5, 4648(a)(9)-(10) &(e), 4685(c)(2) and 4696.1.  By virtue of its \n5  monitoring and support function, and its administration of the RRDPs, State defendant DDS \n6  is also responsible for ensuring that consumers whose community placement is at risk of \n7  failing receive an immediate assessment of any further services and supports which would \n8  make the placement successful, as well as emergency and crisis intervention services to assist \n9  in maintaining the consumer in the living arrangement of his or her choice.   Welf. & Inst. \n10  Code §§ 4418.7, 4648(a)(10) & 4696.1.   Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n11  defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.25(b), 4418.7, \n12  4646, 4646.5, 4648(a)(9)-(10), 4648(e), 4685(c)(2) and 4696.1 by failing to exercise its \n13  discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least \n14  restrictive environment; \n15  i.  Approving community placement plans (\"CPPs\") that set inordinately low \n16  goals for placing individuals in community settings.  State defendant DDS is responsible for \n17  developing criteria for the regional centers' annual CPPs, which are \"not intended to limit \n18  [DDS's] or the regional centers' responsibility … to provide needed services and supports in \n19  the least restrictive, most integrated setting in accord with the Lanterman\" Act.  Welf. & Inst. \n20  Code §§ 4418.25(a)-(b).  Section 4418.25(c) mandates that State defendant DDS review and \n21  approve regional centers' CPPs in light of \"each regional center's current developmental \n22  center population and their corresponding placement level, as well as each regional center's \n23  need to develop new and innovative service models.\"  Section 4418.25(c) further commands \n24  that State defendant DDS hold the regional centers accountable for the developm ent and \n25  implementation of their approved plans.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n26  defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.25 by failing to \n27  exercise its discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports in \n28  the least restrictive environment; \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 65 \n \n\n \n1  j.  Failing to recommend adequate funding for unmet systemic needs for resource \n2  development to enable people living in institutions to move to less restrictive, more \n3  integrated living arrangements.  The Lanterman Act requires that the State Council on \n4  Developmental Disabilities, in consultation with DDS, recommend to State defendant DOF \n5  the level of program development funding to be included in the Governor's Budget. This \n6  recommendation must be based upon information provided by the regional center defendants, \n7  who are required to regularly identify and assess unmet systemic needs. Welf. & Inst. Code \n8  § 4677(b) & (e); see also Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4648(d)-(g).   DDS may allocate funds from \n9  the Program Development Fund, with the consultation of the State Council, to provide the \n10  resources necessary to initiate needed, but unavailable, priority services/ programs. Welf. & \n11  Inst. Code § 4677(a) & (e). Thus, State defendant DDS is responsible for the identificati on \n12  and funding of unmet systemic needs both directly, through its consultation with the State \n13  Council on Developmental Disabilities, and indirectly, by virtue of its duty to monitor and \n14  assist the regional centers in carrying out their responsibilities und er the Lanterman Act.  \n15  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4434, 4629, 4635 & 4651(b).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that \n16  State defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4677 and 4648(d)-\n17  (g) by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services \n18  and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n19  k.  Failing to collaborate to ensure that class members with dual diagnoses are \n20  provided with the supports needed to live in least restrictive community settings.   The \n21  Lanterman Act requires defendants DDS and DMH to jointly develop and implement a \n22  statewide program for encouraging the establishment of sufficient numbers and types of \n23  living arrangements, including community living arrangements, as necessary to meet  the \n24  needs of persons served by those departments.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4510.  The Lanterman \n25  Act also mandates that State defendant DDS collaborate with DMH to establish criteria by \n26  which higher rates may be fixed for living arrangements for people who are  dually diagnosed \n27  with a mental disorder and to provide solutions for the care and treatment of the dually \n28  diagnosed when local agencies request assistance.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4681.1(d).  Section \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 66 \n \n\n \n1  4696.1(c) says that defendants DDS and DMH \"shall collaborate\" to provide a statewide \n2  perspective and technical assistance to local service regions when local problem resolution \n3  mechanisms have been exhausted and state level participation has been requested by both \n4  local agencies. Additionally, Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4434, 4629, 4635 and \n5  4651(b) make State defendant DDS responsible for monitoring and supporting the regional \n6  centers in complying with their responsibilities under Welfare and Institutions Codes sections \n7  4696 and 4696.1 to cooperate with county mental health agencies and obtain needed mental \n8  health services for class members with dual diagnosis.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe \n9  that State defendants DDS and DMH have violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections \n10  4510, 4681.1(d) and 4696.1 by failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the \n11  constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment;  \n12  l.  Failing to establish adequate systems of payment for providers of services and \n13  supports which reflect the actual costs of ensuring high quality, stable services, including \n14  geographic differentials.  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4648(a)(5), 4680, 4681.1 \n15  and 4690 require that State defendant DDS establish and maintain  payment systems for the \n16  services and supports identified in a consumer’s IPP.  “The system shall include a provision \n17  for a rate to ensure that the provider can meet the special needs of consumers and provide \n18  quality services and supports in the least restrictive setting as required  by law.”  Welf. & Inst. \n19  Code § 4648(a)(5).  Sections 4680, 4681.1, 4690, 4697(a)(1) and 4786 also establish \n20  parameters for payment systems.  Section 4681.1(b)(2) states payment systems for group \n21  homes should take into account geographic differentials.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe \n22  that State defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4648(a)(5), \n23  4680, 4681.1, 4690, 4697(a)(1) and 4786 by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with \n24  the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment;   \n25  m.  Failing to request the allocation of  sufficient funds to the regional centers to \n26  carry out their mandated responsibilities.  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4434(b) & \n27  (c), 4620, 4621 and 4629 require that the State, through defendant DDS, contract with and \n28  fund regional centers to carry out their statutorily mandated responsibilities, including \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 67 \n \n\n \n1  conducting assessments and developing and implementing IPPs to enable consumers to live \n2  in non-institutional, community-based settings whenever appropriate.  Plaintiffs are informed \n3  and believe that State defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections \n4  4434(b) & (c), 4620, and 4629 by failing to exercise its discretion thereunder with the \n5  constant goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment;  \n6  n.  Failing to adequately communicate with and monitor the regional centers to \n7  ensure they fulfill their responsibilities under the Lanterman Act.   Welfare and Institutions \n8  Code sections 4416, 4418.25, 4434, 4620, 4629, 4635 and 4651(b), among other sections of \n9  the Act, mandate that State defendant DDS support and monitor the regional centers and, if \n10  necessary, take corrective actions to ensure full compliance with federal and  State law, \n11  including the requirement that services and supports be provided to each consumer in the \n12  least restrictive environment in which his or her needs can be accommodated.  Plaintiffs are \n13  informed and believe that State defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code \n14  sections 4416, 4418.25, 4434, 4620, 4629, 4635 and 4651(b) by failing to exercise its \n15  discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least \n16  restrictive environment;  \n17  o.  Proposing budget allocations that disproportionately allocate funds for \n18  developmental disabilities services to institutional care rather than to community services in \n19  violation of the Lanterman Act mandates for least restrictive services and for cost -effective \n20  services.  The Lanterman Act requires that State defendants provide funding for persons with \n21  developmental disabilities in a cost-effective manner, with special preference given to \n22  community services and supports.  E.g., Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4512(b), 4646(a), \n23  4648(a)(6)&(11), 4669.75(d).  For class members in the DCs whose needs could be met in \n24  the community, in most instances, the cost of DC placement far exceeds the cost of \n25  community-based services and supports.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the State \n26  defendants have violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4512(b), 4646(a), 4648(a)(6) \n27  &(11), and 4669.75(d) by failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant \n28  goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 68 \n \n\n \n1  p.  Failing to ensure that defendants DDS and Director Allenby conduct their \n2  activities and provide services, and properly fund and supervise the regional centers in \n3  compliance with Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4400 et seq. and the Lanterman Act.  \n4  The Secretary of the CHHS Agency has supervisory power over, and is directly responsible \n5  to the Governor for, the operation of DDS.  Gov’t Code §  12850.  Defendants CHHS Agency \n6  and its Secretary, defendant Belshé (who has succeeded Secretary Johnson) is respons ible for \n7  sound fiscal management of DDS, for reviewing and approving its budget, and for ensuring \n8  that the director of DDS maintains control of the administrative, fiscal and program \n9  performance of DDS.  Gov’t Code § 12850.6.  Defendant Belshé is also required to review \n10  the operation and performance of DDS, and to seek to improve its operation.   Id.  Further, \n11  defendant Belshé is responsible for reporting to the Governor when changes in the \n12  organization or operation of the agency are necessary, and to report to the Governor on \n13  efforts taken to ensure that the agency’s programs are properly administered and the goals of \n14  the agency accomplished.  Gov’t Code §§ 12851, 12852.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe \n15  that State defendants CHHS Agency and Belshé have violated Government Code sections \n16  12850, 12850.6, 12851 and 12852 by failing to properly ensure that defendant DDS is \n17  meeting its responsibilities, and have interfered with DDS’s ability to meet its responsibility \n18  to ensure implementation of the Lanterman Act.  This includes failing to approve the \n19  allocation of or proposals for sufficient funds to enable DDS and regional center defendants \n20  to provide integrated community-based services and supports to class members who need \n21  such services and supports.  To the extent that this duty requires the exercise of discretion, \n22  defendants CHHS Agency and Belshé have misinterpreted and violated the Lanterman Act \n23  by failing to exercise their discretion with the constant goal of providing services and \n24  supports in the least restrictive environment; \n25  q.  Failing to exercise budgetary authority in a manner which permits State \n26  defendants CHHS Agency, DDS, DHS, DMH and the regional center defendants to fulfill \n27  their legal obligations under state and federal law, including the Lanterma n Act.  State \n28  defendant DOF and its director have the general power of supervision over all financial \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 69 \n \n\n \n1  policies of the state and are charged with ensuring that the rights and interests of the state are \n2  conserved.  Gov’t. Code § 13070.  DOF must approve all requests for additional funding \n3  submitted by DDS.  DOF is also required to work with the agencies and departments of the \n4  state government to consult with and assist them in managing the funds budgeted to them in a \n5  cost effective manner.  Gov. Code § 13877 et. seq.  DOF is required to carry out its \n6  responsibilities in a manner that enables the other State defendants to conduct their activities \n7  and provide services in compliance with the Lanterman Act.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n8  believe that State defendant DOF and its director have failed to take steps necessary to \n9  provide funding to DDS and other State defendants sufficient to ensure that State defendants \n10  and regional center defendants can conduct their activities and provide services in \n11  compliance with the Lanterman Act.  To the extent that their duties require the exercise of \n12  discretion, State defendant DOF and its director have misinterpreted and violated the \n13  Lanterman Act by failing to exercise their discretion with the constant goal of providing \n14  services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n15  r.  Failing to support State defendant DDS in its efforts to implement the \n16  provisions of the Lanterman Act.  State defendants DHS and its director, defendant Bontá, \n17  have hindered DDS in its efforts to imple ment the provisions of the Lanterman Act by their \n18  actions and omissions as the single state agency for the administration of Medicaid services \n19  in California.  DHS and its director have  power to supervise every phase of the \n20  administration of health care services and medical services in order to secure full compliance \n21  with state and federal laws.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 10740.  DHS has the power to work as an \n22  agent of and in cooperation with the federal government to acquire additional funds for the \n23  implementation of state health programs.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 10748.  Medicaid services in \n24  California (called Medi-Cal) are administered by defendant Bontá, the Director of DHS, the \n25  state agency responsible for administering Medi-Cal mandatory, optional and waiver \n26  services.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5); Welf. & Inst. Code § 14137.  Defendant DHS, as the \n27  single state agency responsible to the federal government (CMS) on how California \n28  administers its Medi-Cal program including HCB waivers, has the authority to request \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 70 \n \n\n \n1  additional waivers or expansion of current HCB waivers. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 10740 and \n2  10748. State defendant DHS’s actions and omissions include, but are not limited to, failing to \n3  apply for administrative costs, expansion of population caps and/or service definitions in \n4  Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver programs, including, but not limited to, the \n5  Developmental Disabilities and Nursing Facility A/B Waivers.  As a result of these actions \n6  and omissions, federal funds available to provide community-based services to many \n7  institutionalized persons with developmental disabilities have not been accessed by the State.  \n8  Defendants DHS and Bontá have misinterpreted and violated the Lanterman Act by failing to \n9  exercise their discretion with the constant goal o f providing services and supports in the least \n10  restrictive environment; \n11  s.  Failing to make available aggregate data on the outcomes of efforts to assist \n12  at-risk consumers to remain in the community and on regional center performance under \n13  their Community Placement Plans (\"CPPs\").  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.25 \n14  (c) and 4418.7(d), respectively, mandate that State defendant DDS \"shall” collect and make \n15  available upon request aggregate data on regional center performance under their CPPs and \n16  on implementation of the deflection requirements of section 4418.7.  Plaintiffs are informed \n17  and believe that State defendant DDS has violated sections 4418.25(c) and 4418.7(d) by \n18  failing to collect and/or make available aggregate data on these matters.  To the  extent that \n19  the duty to collect and/or make available aggregate data involves the exercise of discretion, \n20  the State defendants have violated sections 4418.25(c) and 4418.7(d) by failing to exercise \n21  their discretion with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least \n22  restrictive environment; \n23  t.  Failing to hold individual planning meetings with the \"planning teams\" of \n24  plaintiff class members residing in the DCs as required by,  inter alia, Welfare and \n25  Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b)&(c), 4512(j), 4646, 4646.5 and 4647.  The Lanterman \n26  Act requires that a \"planning team\" jointly develop an individual program plan for every \n27  person eligible for regional center services.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§  4646(c) & 4646(d).  The \n28  Lanterman Act defines the \"planning team\" as a group which includes \"one or more regional \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 71 \n \n\n \n1  center representatives, including the designated regional center service coordinator.\"  Welf. \n2  & Inst. Code § 4512(j); see also Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4647(a) & 4646.5(b) (mandating \n3  regional center participation in the IPP process and setting forth planning team duties \n4  including periodic review of all IPPs.).  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b) and \n5  4418.3(c) make State defendant DDS responsible for convening planning team meetings fo r \n6  DC residents and ensuring that those planning teams develop IPPs consistent with the \n7  mandates of sections 4646 and 4646.5.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that State \n8  defendant DDS has violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b) and 4418.3(c) \n9  by routinely convening planning team meetings for DC residents that are not attended by one \n10  or more regional center representatives, including the designated regional center service \n11  coordinator.  To the extent that the convening of planning team mee tings involves the \n12  exercise of discretion, State defendant DDS has violated sections 4418.3(b) and 4418.3(c) by \n13  exercising its discretion in a manner that ignores the statutory command that a \"planning \n14  team\" shall include \"one or more regional center repre sentatives, including the designated \n15  regional center service coordinator.\"  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4512(j). \n16  u.  {Plaintiffs preserve the right to seek appellate review of the dismissal of \n17  this allegation.}  Plaintiffs incorporate every allegation set forth above and allege that each \n18  and every allegation above states a claim for violation of \"a clear, present, and ministerial \n19  duty.\"  Unamed Physician v. Board of Trustees,  93 Cal. App. 4th 607, 618  (2001).  The \n20  Lanterman Act is a remedial statute enacted for the purpose of redressing \"social, medical, \n21  economic, and legal problems of extreme importance.\"  Welf. &  Inst. Code § 4501.  \n22  “[R]emedial statutes such as the Lanterman Act must be liberally construed to effectuate the \n23  purposes for which they were enacted.”  Clemente v. Amundson, 60 Cal. App. 4th 1094, 1102 \n24  (1998).  Thus, sections of the Lanterman Act that state what \"may\" or \"should\" be done are \n25  enforceable as clear, present, ministerial duties.  See Hayes v. County of Los Angeles, 99 Cal. \n26  74, 80 (1893) (“[w]here the statute directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or for \n27  the public good, the word ‘may’ is the same as the word ‘shall.’  Where persons or the public \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 72 \n \n\n \n1  have an interest in having the act done by the public body,  may in such a statute means \n2  shall.”); People v. Ledsema, 16 Cal. 4th 90, 95 (1997) (same). \n3  3.  Violations Based Upon Exercise of Quasi-Legislative \nPower. \n4 \n231.  In light of the Court's direction that Plaintiffs' allegations meet a stringent standard of \n5 \nspecificity, Plaintiffs do not presently allege that the State defendants have enacted plans and/or \n6 \nregulations which violate the Lanterman Act.  However, discovery is ongoing and Plaintiffs reserve \n7 \nthe right to amend their Petition for Writ of Mandate to conform to pr oof that the State defendants \n8 \nhave improperly exercised quasi-legislative power. \n9 \nB.  DIRECT LIABILITY OF THE REGIONAL CENTER \n10  DEFENDANTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE LANTERMAN \nACT. \n11 \n232.  Plaintiffs' claims against the regional center defendants are not limited by the \n12 \nseparation of powers principles which command that any action seeking to compel official action by \n13 \nState officials must sound in mandamus.  See Common Cause, 49 Cal. 3d at 442 (holding that \n14 \nmandamus is the only method for obtaining judicial compulsion of officia l acts).  The regional center \n15 \ndefendants are private non-profit corporations which contract with State defendant DDS to provide \n16 \nservices and supports to people with developmental disabilities.  See Welf. & Inst. Code § 4640, et \n17 \nseq. \n18 \n233.  Plaintiffs' claims against the regional center defendants sound in mandamus, however \n19 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief are also available for any proven violations of the Lanterman Act by \n20 \nthe regional center defendants.  See ¶¶ 210-212 (setting forth basis for injunctive and declaratory \n21 \nrelief). \n22 \n1.  Violations of Ministerial Duties.         \n23 \n234.  The regional center defendants have violated ministerial duties set forth in the \n24 \nLanterman Act by their policies, practices, actions and omissions including, but not limited to:  \n25 \na.  Failing to attend all planning team meetings and transition conferences for \n26 \nresidents of DCs.  Section 4646 (c) provides that an individual program plan “shall” be \n27 \ndeveloped for any person eligible for regional center services and section 4646(d) requires \n28 \n  that individual program plans “shall” be prepared jointly by the planning team.  Section \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 73 \n \n\n \n1  4512(j) defines the \"planning team\" as a group which includes \"one or more regional center \n2  representatives, including the designated regional center service coordinator.\"  Section \n3  4647(a) identifies participation in the individual program plan process as one of the required \n4  regional center service coordination activities necessary to implement individual program \n5  plans.  Section 4646.5(b) provides that individual program plans “shall” be periodically \n6  reviewed and modified and further provides that such reviews “shall” be done “by the \n7  planning team.”  Section 4418.3(e) requires that participants in transition conferences “shall” \n8  include a regional center representative.  Viewed together, as required by California law, \n9  and/or viewed separately, these sections of the Lanterman Act obligate regional center \n10  representatives to attend and participate in all planning team meetings.  Plaintiffs are \n11  informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated these and other \n12  Lanterman Act provisions by failing to attend planning team meetings and transition \n13  conferences for residents of developmental centers; \n14  b.  Failing to conduct individualized planning according to the mandatory criteria \n15  set forth in, inter alia, Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4646 and 4646.5, which \n16  includes an assessment of the services that would support individuals in the least restrictive \n17  setting.  Section 4646(c) provides that an individual program plan “shall” be developed for \n18  any person eligible for regional center services.  Section 4646.5 specifies matters that “shall” \n19  be included in the individual program plans described in section 4646.  Section 4646.5(a)(1) \n20  requires the “[g]athering of information and conducting assessments to determine the life \n21  goals, capabilities and strengths, preferences, barriers, and concerns or problems of the \n22  person with developmental disabilities.”  Based on the assessment process, section \n23  4646.5(a)(2) requires, for example, that the regional centers develop IPPs that \"shall include\" \n24  a statement of goals designed to maximize opportunities for the consumer to \"be part of \n25  community life in the areas of community participation, housing, work, school, and \n26  leisure….\"  Section 4646.5(a)(4) further requires regional centers to create a schedule of the \n27  type and amount of services and supports to be purchased or otherwise obtained by the \n28  regional center in order to achieve the IPP goals described in section 4646.5(a)(2).  Plaintiffs \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 74 \n \n\n \n1  are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated sections 4646 and \n2  4646.5 by failing to conduct assessments of class members for purposes of including in all \n3  IPPs a statement of goals designed to maximize opportunities for community integration, and \n4  by failing to develop IPPs for class members that include a statement of such goals or a \n5  schedule of services and supports needed to achieve those goals; \n6  c.  Failing to implement Plaintiffs' and class members' IPPs that specify services \n7  needed for movement to non-institutional, community living arrangements or to avoid \n8  placement in an institution.   Section 4648(a) states that regional centers “shall secure \n9  services and supports that meet the needs of the consumer, as determined in the consumer’s \n10  individual program plan.”  Citing section 4648, the California Supreme Court affirmed the \n11  non-discretionary requirement that regional centers implement all IPPs by holding that, while \n12  regional centers have discretion in determining how to implement individual pr ogram plans, \n13  they \"have no discretion at all in determining whether to implement [IPPs]:  they must do \n14  so.\"  ARC, 38 Cal. 3d at 390.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center \n15  defendants have violated section 4648, as construed by the Ca lifornia Supreme Court, by \n16  failing to implement IPPs that specify services needed for movement into less restrictive \n17  settings or deflection from institutions; \n18  d.  Failing to follow the criteria set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section \n19  4648(a) in securing services and supports for consumers.  Section 4648 sets forth the \n20  activities regional centers “shall” conduct to achieve the objectives of each person’s \n21  individual program plan.  Section 4648(a) requires that the regional center “shall” secure \n22  needed services and supports.  Section 4648(a)(1) requires that regional centers \"shall give \n23  highest preference to those services and supports which would allow minors with \n24  developmental disabilities to live with their families, adult persons with developmental \n25  disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community, and that allow all \n26  consumers to interact with persons without disabilities in positive meaningful ways.\"  Section \n27  4648(a)(2) specifies that regional centers \"shall first consider services a nd supports in natural \n28  community, home, work and recreational settings.\"  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 75 \n \n\n \n1  the regional center defendants have violated section 4648 by failing to give primary \n2  consideration, if any consideration at all, to services and supports which would maximize \n3  community integration; \n4  e.  Failing to hold annual meetings with county mental health directors.  Welfare \n5  and Institutions Code section 4696.1(d) commands that regional center directors ”shall” meet \n6  with county mental health directors \"as needed but no less than annually\" to review the \n7  effectiveness of interagency collaboration, address outstanding policy issues between the \n8  agencies, and establish direction and priorities for future collaboration.  Plaintiffs are \n9  informed and believe that the regional center defendants have failed to hold at least annual \n10  meetings with county mental health directors as required by section 4696.1(d); \n11  f.  Failing to develop IPPs recommending community placement and failure to \n12  implement IPP recommendations for community placement of developmental center \n13  residents over the objection of family members or conservators.  Welfare and Institutions \n14  Code section 4646(d) provides that family members and/or conservators may be included in \n15  the decision-making process, but commands that \"[i]ndividual program plans shall be \n16  prepared jointly by the planning team.\"  In addition, permitting family members or \n17  conservators to unilaterally veto community placement recommendations violates DC \n18  residents’ due process rights and the permanent injunction issued in  Richard S. et al. v. DDS \n19  et al. v. Bell et al. (U.S. District Court Case No. SACV 97-219-GLT; CD Cal. 2000).  \n20  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated section \n21  4646(d) by permitting family members and conservators of DC residents to, in effect, \n22  unilaterally prevent community placement of DC residents who could live in less restrictive \n23  settings; \n24  g.  Failing to ensure deflection from placement in an institution by providing \n25  emergency and crisis intervention services as mandated by, inter alia, Welfare and \n26  Institutions Code sections 4648(a)(2) and 4648(a)(10).  Section 4648(a)(2) requires that, in \n27  implementing individual program plans, regional centers “shall” first consider services and \n28  supports in the community.  Section 4648(a)(10) commands that \"[c]risis services shall first \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 76 \n \n\n \n1  be provided without disrupting a person's living arrangement.  If crisis intervention services \n2  are unsuccessful, emergency housing shall be available in the person's home community.\"  \n3  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated sections \n4  4648(a)(2) and 4648(a)(10) by failing to provide emergency and crisis intervention services \n5  in consumers’ own homes and the community when consumers are at risk of placement in an \n6  institution; \n7  h.  Failing to conduct required activities to deflect class members from placement \n8  in DCs.  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.7 commands that regional centers \n9  immediately notify the RRDP to arrange for an immediate assessment of the need for \n10  additional services and supports and to conduct IPP meetings with RRDP staff whenever a \n11  community placement is at risk of failing and admittance to a state DC is a likelihood.  \n12  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have failed to adhere \n13  to the process described in section 4418.7 whenever a community placement of a consumer \n14  is at risk of failing; \n15  i.  Failing to identify and pursue all possible sources of funding and failing to \n16  disseminate information and training to all service coordinators regarding the availability and \n17  requirements of federally funded and private insurance programs as mandated by Welfare \n18  and Institutions Code sections 4659(a) and 4659(d)(2).  Section 4659(a) mandates that \n19  regional centers identify and pursue all possible sources of funding for consumers receiving \n20  regional center services.  In order to make full use of all available resources, section \n21  4659(d)(2) commands that regional centers disseminate information about federally funded \n22  and private insurance to all service coordinators.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the \n23  regional center defendants have not complied with the directives of sections 4659(a) and \n24  4659(d)(2). \n25  2.  Violation of Statutory Requirements.   \n26  235.  The Lanterman Act contains numerous individual provisions which grant the regional \n27  center defendants discretion in carrying out their duties thereunder.  California law requires that \n28  these individual provisions be construed in light of the overall purpo se of the Lanterman Act \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 77 \n \n\n \n1  statutory scheme.  See People v. Morris, 46 Cal. 3d 1, 16 (1988) (\"Statutory language should not be \n2  interpreted in isolation, but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part, \n3  in order to achieve harmony among the other parts\"); People v. Hammer, 30 Cal. 4th 756, 762-63 \n4  (2003) (Courts must \"harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the \n5  particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole\").  \n6  236.  Plaintiffs allege that the regional center defendants, through their policies and \n7  practices, have violated the Lanterman Act by carrying out their duties and obligations under an \n8  improper interpretation of the Lanterman Act:  an interpretation that ignores the ri ght of each person \n9  with developmental disabilities to treatment and services in the least restrictive environment in \n10  which his or her needs can be accommodated.  See ¶¶ 226-229 above (detailing core rights and \n11  minimum requirements of Lanterman Act); also Welf. & Inst. Code § 4502(a); ARC, 38 Cal. 3d at \n12  393 (setting forth core \"rights\" and \"responsibilities\" of the Lanterman Act).  These violations may \n13  be remedied by issuance of a writ of mandate and/or through injunctive and/or declaratory relief.  \n14  The regional center defendants' violations include, but are not limited to: \n15  a.  Failing to conduct assessments and develop IPPs with the constant goal of \n16  placing each resident of public and/or private institutions in the least restrictive environment \n17  in which his or her needs can be accommodated and deflecting individuals at risk from \n18  institutional placement.  The Lanterman Act requires that IPPs developed by regional centers \n19  or DDS “shall include” a statement of goals, based on the individual’s needs, preferences and \n20  life choices, and objectives “which should maximize opportunities for the consumer to . . . be \n21  part of community life in the areas of community participation, housing, work, school, and \n22  leisure . . ..”  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646.5(a)(2).  The Lanterman Act also requires that, in \n23  securing community services and supports, regional centers “shall give highest preferences to \n24  those services and supports which would allow minors with developmental disabilities to live \n25  with their families, adult persons with developmental disabilities to live as independently as \n26  possible in the community, and that allow all consumers to interact with persons without \n27  disabilities in positive meaningful ways.”  Welf. & Inst. Code §  4648(a)(1).  In implementing \n28  IPPs, regional centers “shall first consider services and supports in natural community, home, \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 78 \n \n\n \n1  work and recreational settings.”  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4648(a)(2).  Plaintiffs are informed \n2  and believe that the regional center defendants have violated the IPP process requirements i n \n3  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4646.5(a)(2), 4648(a)(1) and 4648(a)(2) by failing to \n4  exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports \n5  in the least restrictive environment; \n6  b.  Failing to modify IPPs to reflect court determinations that a DC is no longer \n7  the least restrictive appropriate placement in which the individual’s needs can be \n8  accommodated.  When a court determines — either in reviewing a prior commitment order \n9  or in reviewing a petition for writ o f habeas corpus pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code \n10  sections 4800-4801 — that a DC is no longer the least restrictive appropriate placement in \n11  which a DC resident’s needs can be accommodated, the Lanterman Act requires that the IPP \n12  be modified to reflect the individual’s current needs.  E.g., Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646.5(b) \n13  (requiring that IPPs be modified as necessary in response to the persons achievement or \n14  changing needs).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that regional centers have violated \n15  section 4646.5(b) by failing to develop or implement IPPs in accord with such court orders, \n16  thereby failing to exercise their discretion with the constant goal of providing services and \n17  supports in the least restrictive environment; \n18  c.  Failing to adequately assess community-integrated service and support options \n19  and failing to develop IPPs identifying the community services and supports which would \n20  allow individuals to move to or remain successfully living in less restrictive settings.  The \n21  Lanterman Act requires that each resident’s IPP include an assessment, performed by \n22  qualified individuals, of the services which could support them in non -institutional, \n23  community settings.  Welf & Inst. Code §§ 4418.3(b)-(h), 4509, 4646.5,4647 and 4648(a)(1).  \n24  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated Welfare \n25  and Institutions Code sections 4418.3(b)-(h), 4509, 4646.5, 4647 and 4648(a)(1) by failing to \n26  exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and  supports \n27  in the least restrictive environment; \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 79 \n \n\n \n1  d.  With respect to DC residents, failing to develop IPPs recommending \n2  community placement and failing to implement IPP recommendations for community \n3  placement over the objection of family members or conservators.   The Lanterman Act \n4  requires that decisions of IPP planning teams be made jointly.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4646(d).  \n5  Permitting conservators and family members of DC residents to, in effect, unilaterally \n6  prevent community placement of DC residents who could live in less restrictive settings is \n7  inconsistent with the Lanterman Act IPP process and the integration mandate.  In addition, \n8  permitting family members or conservators to unilaterally veto community placement \n9  recommendations violates DC residents’ due process rights and the permanent injunction \n10  issued in Richard S. et al. v. DDS et al. v. Bell et al. (U.S. District Court Case No. SACV 97-\n11  219-GLT; CD Cal. 2000).  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center \n12  defendants have violated Welfare and Institutions Code section 4646(d) by failing to exercise \n13  their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the \n14  least restrictive environment; \n15  e.  Failing to afford class members the opportunity to make meaningful choices, \n16  including but not limited to choices regarding where and with whom they live.  The \n17  Lanterman Act requires that every public or private agency that serves persons with \n18  developmental disabilities shall provide those individuals with the opportunity to e xercise \n19  decision-making skills and make meaningful choices concerning their own lives.  Welf. & \n20  Inst. Code §§ 4502.1, 4646, 4646.5.  The regional center defendants deprive class members \n21  of these rights by, for example, failing to provide them with informat ion in an understandable \n22  form, including experiential information, on the variety of possible alternatives to \n23  institutions.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have \n24  violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4502.1, 4646 and 4646.5 by failing to \n25  exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing services and supports \n26  in the least restrictive environment; \n27  f.  Depriving plaintiffs and the class they represent of the opportunity for \n28  integration into the mainstream of community life by failing to maintain sufficient quality, \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 80 \n \n\n \n1  stable, community living arrangements and ancillary supports to adequately provide for the \n2  needs and choices of class members who currently reside in public and private institutions , \n3  and/or who are at risk of placement in an institutional setting. Welfare and Institutions Code \n4  sections 4418.25, 4418.5, 4512(b), 4513, 4648, 4651(b), 4652, 4677, 4669.2, 4680, 4685, \n5  4685.1, 4688, 4689, 4689.1, 4690, 4696, 4696.1 and 4787 provide for placement in \n6  community living arrangements, including home-based arrangements, provide for the \n7  development of innovative resources to meet consumers’ needs and require the State and \n8  regional center defendants to maintain, develop and adequately fund a sufficient array of \n9  quality, community living arrangements and ancillary supports to provide for class members \n10  to be served in least restrictive community settings.  When necessary to expand the \n11  availability of needed services, regional centers may, for example,  solicit providers through \n12  requests for proposals, request funds for the start-up costs of new services, and use creative \n13  service delivery models.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4648 (e) & 4418.25.  Wtih the approval of \n14  DDS, regional centers may develop service delivery alternatives outside the confines of other \n15  provisions of law.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4669.2.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that \n16  regional center defendants fail to fully and effectively utilize available community service \n17  models, expand the availability of current service models and develop new and innovative \n18  resources, which would enable class members to live successfully in non -institutional \n19  settings.  Thus, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have \n20  violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.25, 4418.5, 4512(b), 4513, 4648, \n21  4651(b), 4652, 4677, 4669.2, 4680, 4685, 4685.1, 4688, 4689, 4689.1, 4690, 4696, 4696.1 \n22  and 4787  by failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of \n23  providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n24  g.  Failing to fully and effectively obtain and utilize community-based waiver \n25  services for those class members eligible for such services.  The regional center defendants \n26  are responsible for identifying and maximizing utilization of federal funding and other \n27  sources of funding for community-based services, including utilizing community-based \n28  waiver services for eligible class members.  Welf. & Inst. Code § 4659.  Though the regional \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 81 \n \n\n \n1  center defendants have limited discretion in making use of available funding sources, \n2  plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated Welfare \n3  and Institutions Code section 4659 by failing to exercise their discretion with the const ant \n4  goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n5  h.  Failing to take all necessary steps to deflect people at risk of \n6  institutionalization from placement in an institution.  The Lanterman Act requires regional \n7  centers to conduct adequate assessments and provide needed services and supports, including \n8  crisis services and supplemental supports, to enable consumers to remain in the least \n9  restrictive, most integrated setting in which their needs can be accommodated.  Welf. & Inst. \n10  Code §§ 4646, 4646.5, 4648(a)(9) & (a)(10), 4685(c)(2) & 4696.1(b)&(d).  In addition to \n11  these overall requirements, whenever a community placement of a consumer is at risk of \n12  failing and admittance to a state developmental center is a likelihood, the Lanter man Act \n13  requires the regional center to notify and collaborate with the DDS-administered RRDPs on \n14  an immediate assessment, on conducting an IPP and on the provision of needed additional \n15  emergency services until the consumer’s living arrangement is stable.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n16  §§ 4418.7 .  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have \n17  violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4418.7, 4646, 4646.5, 4648(a)(9) & (a)(10), \n18  4685(c)(2), and 4696.1(b)&(d) by failing to exercise their discretion with the constant goal of \n19  providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n20  i.  Submitting community placement plans (\"CPPs\") that set inordinately low \n21  goals for placing individuals from the DCs in community settings, failing  to request \n22  sufficient resources for placement and deflection, and failing to fully implement approved \n23  CPPs.  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4418.25 mandates that regional centers submit \n24  annual CPPs identifying selected DC residents for movement to  community settings, \n25  identifying the funding needed for comprehensive assessments and community supports, and \n26  identifying services needed for deflection.  The review criteria of section 4418.25(c) makes \n27  clear that each regional center must develop its plan  light of its \"current developmental center \n28  population and their corresponding placement level, as well as each regional center's need to \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 82 \n \n\n \n1  develop new and innovative service models.\"  Regional centers are to be held accountable for \n2  development and implementation of their approved plans.  Id.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n3  believe that regional center defendants have violated Welfare and Institutions Code section \n4  4418.25 by failing to exercise their discretion thereunder with the constant goal of providing \n5  services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n6  j.  Failing to provide specialized services for class members with dual diagnoses \n7  in order that they may live in least restrictive community settings.  The Lanterman Act \n8  requires that the regional center defendants coordinate with county mental health agencies to \n9  plan for and deliver services and supports to people with dual diagnoses.  Welf. & Inst. Code \n10  §§ 4696, 4696.1.  Regional centers are required to develop memoranda of understanding \n11  addressing specific issues and to meet with local health directors at least annually to review \n12  the effectiveness of interagency collaboration, address outstanding policy issues between the \n13  agencies, and establish direction and priorities for future collaboration.  Welf. &  Inst. Code \n14  § 4696.1(b)&(d).  Further, regional centers may request higher rates for residential living \n15  arrangements for people who are dually diagnosed (Welf. & Inst. Code § 4681.1(d)), and \n16  may seek to negotiate higher than normally permissible rates for s ervices, including \n17  psychiatric services, that people with dual diagnoses may need (Welf. & Inst. Code \n18  § 4669.2(a)(3)). Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have \n19  violated Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4681.1(d), 4669.2(a)(3), 4696 and 4696.1 by \n20  failing to exercise their discretion with the constant goal of providing services and supports \n21  in the least restrictive environment; \n22  k.  Failing to maintain the staffing and/or expertise necessary to ensure that class \n23  members have the supports they need to move to or remain successfully living in less \n24  restrictive settings.  Welfare and Institutions Code section 4640.6(g) requires that regional \n25  centers, pursuant to their contracts, must have, or contract with, staff possessing exp ertise in \n26  the areas of, inter alia, community integration, housing, criminal justice, family support, and \n27  quality assurance.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional centers provide \n28  inadequate expertise and assistance in these areas and have thus violated Welfare and \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 83 \n \n\n \n1  Institutions Code section 4640.6(g) by failing to exercise their discretion with the constant \n2  goal of providing services and supports in the least restrictive environment; \n3  l.  Failing to adequately identify unmet systemic needs for resource development \n4  to enable people living in institutions to move to less restrictive, more integrated living \n5  arrangements.  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4648(d), (e), (f) & (g), and 4677(b) \n6  require that the regional center defendants identify services and supports needed but currently \n7  unavailable so that services and supports are developed to support consumers in integrated \n8  settings.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the regional center defendants have violated \n9  Welfare and Institutions Code sections 4648(d), (e), (f) & (g), and 4677(b) by failing to \n10  exercise their discretion with the constant goal of providing services and supports in the least \n11  restrictive environment; \n12  C.  ALL DEFENDANTS ARE INDISPENSABLE PARTIES WITH \nRESPECT TO ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE LANTERMAN \n13  ACT. \n14  237.  All of the defendants have an interest relating to this action because all of the \n15  defendants play key roles in the administration and delivery of services and supports to Californians \n16  with developmental disabilities.  All of the defendants are so situated that the disposition of the \n17  action in the absence of any of the defendants may impede their ability to protect their interest, or \n18  may leave any of the remaining parties subject to the risk of incurring obligations that are \n19  inconsistent with the systems and procedures set forth in the Lanterman Act.  \n20  238.  Because all of the defendants play key roles and work together in the administration \n21  and delivery of services and supports to Californians with developmental disabilities, complete relief \n22  cannot be accorded in the absence of any of the defendants. \n23  XI. \n24  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n25  (Deprivation of Rights Under State Non-Discrimination Law) \n26  239.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above  \n27  240.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against all defendants.  \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 84 \n \n\n \n1  241.  Pursuant to California Government Code section 11135 and Welfare and Institutions \n2  Code section 4502 and the implementing regulations, any program or activity which receives State \n3  financial assistance or that is funded by the State, including the State itself, is prohibited from \n4  discriminating against a person with a physical or mental disability and is required to provide \n5  services in the most integrated setting possible. \n6  242.  Plaintiffs and class members are persons with disabilities within the meaning of \n7  Government Code section 11135 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 4502. \n8  243.  Defendants operate programs and activities that are funded directly by the State .  \n9  244.   Defendants DDS and regional centers have discriminated against those class members \n10  who reside in institutions in violation of Government Code section 11135 by failing to provide \n11  services in the most integrated setting possible even though in many cases  these defendants have \n12  determined or recommended that class members could be served in less restrictive residential \n13  settings in the community. \n14  245.  All defendants, by their policies, practices, and methods of administration—including \n15  those related to assessment of needs, funding, rate-setting, and program development—have failed to \n16  identify the services that would enable individual plaintiffs and class members to live in the most \n17  integrated settings appropriate and failed to ensure the availability of sufficient community programs \n18  to meet the long-term care needs of plaintiffs and class members.  The result of defendants’ conduct \n19  is unnecessary segregation and isolation of plaintiffs and class members, and the risk of unnecessary \n20  institutionalization for some class members, in violation of Government Code section 11135 \n21  requiring that services be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \n22  individuals with disabilities. \n23  246.  In addition, while defendants provide many people with less se vere developmental \n24  disabilities appropriate residential services in non-institutional community-based settings, class \n25  members who have more severe disabilities, including those with challenging behaviors, dual \n26  diagnoses, or medical conditions, are disproportionately denied the same opportunities.  Defendants \n27  have thereby additionally violated Government Code section 11135 by discriminating against \n28  plaintiffs and class members based on the severity of their disabilities. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 85 \n \n\n \n1  XII. \n2  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n3  (Deprivation of Rights Under the Americans with Disabilities Act) \n4  247.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n5  248.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against defendants Belshé, Allenby, \n6  Bontá and Gage who are public agency directors responsible for the operation of a public entity, \n7  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. sections 12131(1)(A) and (B). \n8  249.  Plaintiffs and class members are “qualified individuals with a disability” within the \n9  meaning of 42 U.S.C. section 12131(2), in that they have a physical and/or mental impairment which \n10  substantially limits one or more major life activities, including their ability to live independently \n11  without support. \n12  250.  Defendants are obligated under the ADA to administer their programs in a manner that \n13  supports rather than undermines the availability of an integrated community service delivery system.  \n14  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(3); 35.130(d). \n15  251.  Defendants Belshé, Allenby, Bontá and Genest violate Title II of the ADA by utilizing \n16  methods of administration that subject qualified people with disabilities to discrimination on the \n17  basis of disability in, inter alia, failing to properly assess the services and supports that would enable \n18  plaintiffs to live in the community, failing to utilize available sources of funding  for community \n19  services, favoring institutional care over community care in the allocation of funds, and failing to \n20  inform plaintiffs of community living options and ancillary services. \n21  252.  Defendants Belshé’s, Allenby’s, Bontá’s, and Genest's policies and pra ctices—\n22  including those related to assessment, funding, rate-setting and program development—have failed \n23  to ensure the availability of community programs sufficient to meet the needs of plaintiffs and class \n24  members and have made the creation of a sufficient number and variety of integrated community \n25  living options and ancillary services all but impossible.   These defendants have thereby \n26  discriminated against those class members who reside in institutions and those who are at risk of \n27  institutionalization in violation of Title II of the ADA by failing to provide services in the most \n28  integrated setting appropriate even when plaintiffs and class members have been recommended for \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 86 \n \n\n \n1  more integrated community living arrangements.  Defendants Belshé, Allenby, Bontá, a nd Genest \n2  thereby violate Title II of the ADA and implementing regulations including, but not limited to, the \n3  ADA’s integration mandate, which requires that such services be provided in the most integrated \n4  setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n5  253.  In addition, while defendants provide many people with less severe developmental \n6  disabilities appropriate in non-institutional community living arrangements, class members who \n7  have more severe disabilities, including those with challenging behaviors, dual diagnoses, or medical \n8  conditions, are disproportionately denied the same opportunities.  Defendants Belshé, Allenby, \n9  Bontá, and Genest have thereby additionally violated Title II of the ADA by discriminati ng against \n10  class members based on the severity of their disabilities.  \n11  XIII. \n12  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n13  (Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n14  254.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above  \n15  255.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against all defendants. \n16  256.  Plaintiffs and class members are \"otherwise qualified individuals with a disability\" \n17  under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended—29 U.S.C. section 794 and \n18  implementing regulations—in that they have mental and/or physical disabilities which substantially \n19  limit their ability to live independently without adequate supports and meet the essential eligibil ity \n20  requirements for long-term care under Medi-Cal and other state and local programs.  \n21  257.  Defendants are recipients of federal financial assistance within the meaning of 29 \n22  U.S.C. section 794(b), including federal Medicaid (Medi-Cal) funds and targeted case management \n23  funds under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.   \n24  258.   Defendants have denied plaintiffs and class members access to the array of \n25  community services they need and, instead, have offered them services only if they are confined in \n26  segregated facilities, thereby excluding them from participation in, denying them the benefits of, and \n27  otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under programs and activities receiving federal financial \n28  assistance, in violation of section 504 and its implementing regulatio ns \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 87 \n \n\n \n1  259.  Unnecessary segregation and isolation of people with disabilities in institutions \n2  constitutes unlawful discrimination under section 504.  Yet, as set forth previously, defendants have \n3  perpetuated the segregation of plaintiffs and class members in large  institutions and placed class \n4  members who need out-of-home care at risk of institutionalization, in violation of section 504.   \n5  260.  The population of California’s state institutions, large SNFs, ICF-DDs, and psychiatric \n6  facilities who have developmental disabilities tends to be persons with severe disabilities, including \n7  dual diagnoses.  These people remain isolated in institutions because of defendants’ policies and \n8  practices and underfunding which restrict the development of stable, quality community services  for \n9  people with severe disabilities. \n10  261.  Under defendants’ system, persons with severe disabilities remain isolated in large \n11  institutions, or are at great risk of moving to institutions.  Defendants have therefore further \n12  discriminated against plaintiffs and class members based on the severity of their disabilities by \n13  denying community services to people with severe disabilities or challenging needs in violation of \n14  section 504. \n15  262.  Defendants have further violated section 504 by discriminating against plaintiffs and \n16  class members by utilizing criteria and methods of administration that discriminate against people \n17  with disabilities as set forth previously.  Defendants’ policies and practices preclude the availability \n18  or provision of integrated, community programs even when such programs constitute the most \n19  integrated setting appropriate to class members’ needs.  Defendants’ criteria and methods of \n20  administering developmental disability services have caused the continued, unnecessary segregation \n21  and isolation of people with developmental disabilities in large public and private institutions. \n22  XIV. \n23  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  (Violation of State Constitutional Rights) \n25  263.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above.  \n26  264.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against all defendants. \n27  265.  Article 1, section 1 of the California Constitution guarantees to every citizen of the \n28  State the fundamental right to be free and independent, to e njoy and defend life and liberty, and to \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 88 \n \n\n \n1  pursue and obtain safety, happiness, and privacy.  Article 1, section 7(a) of the California \n2  Constitution provides that “[a] person may not be deprived of ... liberty ... without due process of \n3  law or denied equal protection of the laws …” \n4  266.  Defendants’ policies and practices which are challenged in this action have resulted \n5  and will result in the indefinite and inappropriate institutionalization of plaintiffs and class members.  \n6  These policies and practices thereby violate the rights guaranteed plaintiffs and class members under \n7  Article 1, sections 1 and 7(a) for the following reasons: \n8  a)  The personal liberty interests protected under Article 1, section 1 include a \n9  fundamental interest in habilitation – that is, the right to achieve one’s maximum potential.  \n10  The policies and actions of defendants have prevented plaintiffs and class members from \n11  achieving their maximum potential by, inter alia, denying them the opportunity to acquire \n12  skills, and causing them to lose skills that would enable them to achieve greater \n13  independence and become more productive members of society. \n14  b)  The State must provide treatment and services in a manner which least drastically \n15  curtails the freedom of the individual.  By failing to ensure that plain tiffs and class members \n16  receive services under the least restrictive conditions necessary to meet their individual \n17  needs, defendants have violated and continue to violate class members’ right to personal \n18  liberty guaranteed under Article 1, section 1. \n19  c)  Inappropriate institutionalization constitutes a form of physical restraint and \n20  violates the guarantees of Article 1, sections 1 and 7(a) which establish substantive and \n21  procedural protections against unreasonable bodily restraint. \n22  d)  Inappropriate confinement in public and private institutions infringes on \n23  plaintiffs’ and class members’ fundamental freedom to associate by preventing them from \n24  living in the community, thereby restricting their ability to participate in community \n25  activities and associate with non-disabled members of the community, including family and \n26  friends. \n27  e)  The unnecessary and inappropriate segregation in public and private institutions \n28  of persons with developmental disabilities, including plaintiffs and class members, whose \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 89 \n \n\n \n1  needs could be met in  less restrictive placements in the community, denies these individuals \n2  equal protection of the laws in violation of Art. 1, §7(a).  Moreover, the inappropriate \n3  segregation and confinement of class members in public and private institutions adversely \n4  affects their fundamental rights, including the rights to liberty, privacy, and freedom of \n5  association, thereby further denying them rights to due process and equal protection of the \n6  laws guaranteed under the California Constitution. \n7  XV. \n8  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n9  (Violation of Federal Constitutional Rights) \n10  267.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n11  268.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against all defendants. \n12  269.  Plaintiffs and class members have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in \n13  receiving minimally adequate or reasonable care and services and in being free from undue restraint, \n14  including the right to be free of confinement in an institution, when professional judgment \n15  recommends that institutionalization is not necessary.  Plaintiffs and class members also have a \n16  fundamental liberty interest in being able to move to the community and seek their release from \n17  institutions without arbitrary procedures.  Thus, plaintiffs and class members have the right to an \n18  assessment of the appropriateness of community services by qualified professionals who have \n19  knowledge of the possible variety of community living options and ancillary services and no conflict \n20  of interest. \n21  270.  The policies, practices, actions and omissions of defendants deprive plaintiffs of their \n22  fundamental liberty interests in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n23  including, but not limited to: \n24  a)  Plaintiffs and class members have been denied minimally adequate habilitation \n25  and/or have been subject to undue restraint by being confined in institutional settings when \n26  they could live successfully in small integrated community homes; \n27  b)  Many individual plaintiffs and class members have been recommended by their \n28  IPP teams, including state and regional center professionals, for movement from public or \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 90 \n \n\n \n1  private institutions to less restrictive community homes, yet they remain institutionalized due \n2  to the lack of adequate community resources which can meet their individual  needs; \n3  c)  The state and/or regional center professionals on the IPP teams of other plaintiffs \n4  and class members residing in public and private institutions have failed to recommend them \n5  for movement to community homes; however, frequently these decisions substantially depart \n6  from accepted professional judgment standards and practices in that the professionals making \n7  placement recommendations; for example, were not qualified, lacked sufficient knowledge of \n8  community options and/or made decisions based on factors other than whether the \n9  individual’s needs could be met in a more integrated community setting; and  \n10  d)  The arbitrary failure to recommend or consider plaintiffs or class members for \n11  movement to a community home is a substantial departure from professional judgment, \n12  standards and practices including, but not limited to, the failure to recommend an individual \n13  for movement to the community based on the objections of his/her family or conservator in \n14  violation of the injunction in  Richard S et al. v. DDS et al. v. Bell, et al, Federal District \n15  Court for the Central District of California (SACV 97-219-GLT). \n16  271.  Defendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and class members to the freedoms of \n17  expression and association secured by the First Amendment by preventing them from living in the \n18  community, thereby restricting their ability to participate in community activities and associate with \n19  non-disabled members of the community including family and friends.  \n20  272.  Defendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and class members secured by the \n21  Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by establishing, encouraging and otherwise \n22  sanctioning programs, policies and practices that have excluded, separated and segregated people \n23  with developmental disabilities from society without any rational basis. \n24  273.  In all of this, defendants have, under color of state law, regulation, usage or ordinance, \n25  deprived plaintiffs and class members of rights, privileges or immunities secured to them by the \n26  Constitution or laws of the United States in violation of 42 U.S.C. section  1983. \n27  XVI. \n28  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 91 \n \n\n \n1  (Violation of Title XIX:  Medicaid) \n2  274.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n3  275.  This cause of action is brought by all plaintiffs against State defendants. \n4  276.  Defendants oversee and are responsible for administering and providing Medi-Cal, a \n5  program of medical aid and services to people in California, some of whom have developmental \n6  disabilities, that is governed by the Medicaid Act, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and by \n7  Welfare & Institutions Code section 14000 et seq. \n8  277.  Plaintiffs and class members are eligible for Medi-Cal Home and Community-based \n9  (HCB) waiver services. \n10  278.  Defendants’ policies and practices violate the rights of plaintiffs and class members \n11  including, but not limited to: \n12  a)  Failing to determine whether it is necessary and desirable for them to remain in \n13  the DCs and other Title XIX facilities, as required by 42 C.F.R.  section 456.609(b); \n14  b)  Failing to review adequately the appropriateness of their continued placement in \n15  the DCs and other Title XIX facilities in which they reside and failing to determine the \n16  feasibility of meeting their needs through alternative non-institutional services, as required by \n17  42 C.F.R. section 456.609(c); \n18  c)  Failing to inform them of the non-institutional HCB waiver alternatives to Medi-\n19  Cal funded DCs, SNFs, ICF-DDs and other large ICF/MR facilities as required by 42 \n20  U.S.C. sections 1396n(c)(2)(C) and 1396n(d)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. section 441.302(d)(1); \n21  d)  Failing to offer a meaningful choice between segregated institutional care and \n22  appropriate integrated community services because a sufficient array of quality community \n23  services, including those specified in HCB waivers, does not in fact exist, as required by 42 \n24  U.S.C. sections 1396n(c)(2)(C) and 1396n(d)(2)(C), 42 C.F.R. section 441.302(d)(2); \n25  e)  {This allegation has been dismissed by the Court.  Plaintiffs preserve the \n26  right to seek appellate review of the dismissal of this allegation.}  Failing to ensure the \n27  provision of necessary safeguards to assure that care and services are provided in a manner \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 92 \n \n\n \n1  consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients, in \n2  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(19). \n3  f)  Failing to provide HCB waiver services with reasonable promptness, as required \n4  by 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(a)(8), 42 C.F.R. section 435.930(a); \n5  g)  Failing to furnish community services comparably to all eligible individuals, as \n6  required by 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(a)(10)(B);and \n7  h)  Failing to use methods and procedures, including funding, necessary to safeguard \n8  against unnecessary utilization of institutional services and enlist enough providers so that \n9  community services are available as required by 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(a)(30)(A) and in \n10  violation of Congressional intent to “provid[e] suitable alternatives to institutional care.”  113 \n11  Cong. Rec. 11417 (1967).     \n12  279.  As a result, plaintiffs and class members are at risk of being, or continue to be \n13  unnecessarily institutionalized. \n14  280.  Defendants, through defendants DHS and Bontá, have failed to apply for expansion of \n15  the HCB Nursing Facility waiver sufficient to meet the needs of eligible individuals throughout the \n16  state, including plaintiffs and class members, so that feasible community alternatives are available \n17  promptly to people with nursing needs in violation of 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(a)(8), 42 C.F.R. \n18  section 435.930(a), and 42 U.S.C. section 1396n(c)(2)(C), Welfare & Institutions Code section \n19  14137. \n20  281.   {This allegation has been dismissed by the Court.  Plaintiffs preserve the right to \n21  seek appellate review of the dismissal of this allegation.}  In all of this, defendants have, under \n22  color of state law, regulation, usage or ordinance, deprived plaintiffs and class members of rights, \n23  privileges or immunities secured to them by the Constitution or laws of the United States in violation \n24  of 42 U.S.C. section  1983. \n25  282.  Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law for defendants’ actions \n26  complained of above. \n27 \n28 \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 93 \n \n\n \n1  283.  Petitioners and each of them are beneficially interested in respondents’ discharge of \n2  their obligations as set forth herein and suffer irreparable injury from defendants’ failure to discharge \n3  their obligations. \n4  284.  {This allegation has been dismissed by the Court.  Plaintiffs preserve the right to \n5  seek appellate review of the dismissal of this allegation.}  In all of this, defendants have violated \n6  their clear, present, and ministerial duty pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 \n7  to act in accordance with state and federal law.  \n8  285.  In all of this, defendants have violated their obligation pursuant to California Code of \n9  Civil Procedure section 1085 to exercise their discretion within proper limits and under a correct \n10  interpretation of the law. \n11  XVII. \n12  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n13  (Unlawful & Unfair Business Practices) \n14  286.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n15  287.  This cause of action is brought by the named representatives plaintiffs, organizational \n16  plaintiffs, taxpayer plaintiffs and/or on behalf of the general public against the regional center \n17  defendants. \n18  288.  Regional center defendants have committed and continue to commit numerous \n19  unlawful business practices as defined by Business and Professions Code section 17200 by engaging \n20  in policies and practices, that violate the Lanterman Act, state and federal laws prohibiting \n21  discrimination on the basis of disability and constitutional protections as set forth in the causes of \n22  action one through six above. \n23  289.  Defendant regional centers have committed and continue to commit unfair business \n24  practices as defined by Business and Profession Code section 17200 by conducting their business in \n25  a manner that is injurious to the plaintiffs and members of the class, by unnecessarily  segregating \n26  them in institutional settings, the resulting substantial injury plaintiffs and class members suffer is \n27  not outweighed by the utility of defendants’ practice, and is not something that the plaintiffs or class \n28  members could have easily avoided. \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 94 \n \n\n \n1  290.  Defendant regional centers’ unlawful and unfair business practices are enjoinable \n2  pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17200. \n3  XVIII. \n4  NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n5  (Illegal Expenditure of Taxpayer Money) \n6  291.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate every allegation and paragraph set forth above. \n7  292.  This cause of action is brought by the taxpayer plaintiffs against all defendants. \n8  293.  Defendants have expended tax moneys and threaten and will continue to spend tax \n9  moneys in an illegal manner as set forth in causes of act ion one through seven above. \n10  294.  There is no provision in law for plaintiffs, as taxpayers, to receive money damages for \n11  unlawful government conduct. \n12  295.  Money damages are extremely difficult to ascertain. \n13  296.  Money damages would not adequately compensate plaintiffs, as taxpayers, for \n14  unlawful government conduct. \n15  297.  Plaintiffs are without a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of \n16  the law to compel defendants to enforce and comply with the legal requirements described herein.   \n17  298.  Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury unless and until \n18  this Court enjoins the defendants from continuing their illegal conduct. \n19  299.  An actual controversy has arisen between plaintiffs and defendants as set forth in \n20  causes of action one through seven. \n21  300.  A judicial declaration is necessary so that the parties may ascertain their rights in this \n22  controversy. \n23  RELIEF REQUESTED \n24  1.  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to grant the following relief:  \n25  2.  Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing jurisdiction until \n26  defendants are in full compliance with every order of this Court.  \n27  3.

As to defendants Belshé, Allenby, Bontá and Genest, declare that defendants’ policies, \n16  practices, acts and omissions, as set forth above, discriminate against plaintiffs and class members \n17  on the basis of disability, and on the basis of severity of disability, by utilizing methods of \n18  administration, applying policies, and engaging in practices that result in unnecessary segregation \n19  and institutionalization in violation of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations.  \n20  6.  As to the State defendants, declare that defendants’ policies, practices, acts and \n21  omissions as set forth above deny plaintiffs their rights to reasonable promptness, equal access, and \n22  freedom of choice of community services in violation of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and its \n23  implementing regulations and 42 U.S.C. section 1983. \n24  7.  As to the regional center defendants, declare that defendants’ unfair and/or unlawful \n25  conduct constitutes unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of Business and Professions \n26  Code section 17200. \n27  8.  Enjoin all defendants, their officers, agents, employees, successors, and all other \n28  persons in active concert or participation with any of them from further violation of plaintiffs’ and \n \nFIFTH AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT/ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  / NO. 2002-038715 \n 96 \n \n\n \n1  class members’ rights under the Lanterman Act,  Government Code section 11135, section 504 of \n2  the Rehabilitation Act, the California Constitution and the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \n3  section 1983. \n4  9.

Dept.:  22 \n12 \n13 \n14 \nThe motion of PlaintifTs for class certification came on for hearing on December 22, \nIS \n2005, in Department 22 of this Court, the Honorable Ronald M. Sabraw presiding.  Counsel \n16 \nappeared on behalf of Plaintiffs and on behalf of Defendants.  After consideration of the points \n17 \nand authorities and the evidence, as well as the oral argument of counsel, IT IS ORDERED: The \n18 \nmotion of Plaintiffs for class certification is DENIED \n19 \n20 \n21  LEGAL FRAMEWORK - STANDARD APPROACH. \n22 \nClass actions in California are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 382, \n23 \nauthorizing such suits \"when the question is one of a common or general interest, of many \n24 \npersons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the \n25 \ncourt.\" \n26 \n\nClass certification under the UCL is determined under the standards in C.c.P. 382.  The \n2  COUli must inquire into numerosity, ascertainability, whether common questions of law or fact \n3 \npredominate, whether the class representatives have claims or defenses typical of the class; and \n4 \nwhether the class representatives can represent the class adequately.  Linder, 23 Cal.4th at 435. \n5 \nOther relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward \n(, \nultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the \n7 \nclass approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.  Linder, 23 CalAth \n8 \nat 435.  In addition, the trial cOUIi may assess the advantages of alternative procedures for \n9 \n10  handling the controversy.  Basurco v. 21 sf Century Ins. Co. (2003) 108 Cal. App. 4th 110, 120-\nII  122; Caro v.  Procter & Gamble Co.  (I993) 18 Cal. App. 4th 644, 660-662.  It is plaintiffs' \n12 \nburden to support each of the above factors with a factual showing.  See Hamwi v. Citinational-\n13 \nBuckeye Inv. Co. (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 462. \n14 \nThe Court is vested with discretion in weighing the concerns that affect class \n15 \ncertification.  Sav-on Drug Stores Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 326, 336. \n16 \n\"[BJecause group action also has the potential to create injustice, trial courts are required to \n17 \n18  'carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class-action \n19  only were substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the cOllli's.' Linder v.  Thri/iy Oil Co. \n20 \n(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435. \n21 \n22 \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK - WHEN ONLY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SOUGHT. \nThe Court has considered that Plaintiffs are seeking systemwide injunctive relief only and \n24 \nare not seeking individualized relief.  C.C.P. section 382 does not include specific standards and \n25 \nanalytical categories such as those found in F.R.C.P. 23 and California case law provides little \n26 \n2 \n\nguidance on whether the standard for class certification is different depending on whether the \n2  claims are for injunctive relief (as under 23(b)(2»  or for monetary and injunctive relief (as under \n3 \n23(b)(3».  Consistent with the direction in Say-On that the trial courts should adopt innovative \n4 \nprocedures, the Court has considered whether a different class certification analysis is \n5 \nappropriate when, as here, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief only.  Bell v. American Title Ins. Co. \n6 \n(1991) 226 Cal. App. 3d 1589, 1603-1609 (applying analytical categories of the federal rules in \n7 \nCalifornia class action). \n8 \nThe Court's analysis when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief would be different in the \n9 \n10  following patiiculars.  The commonality analysis would be, as suggested by Plaintiffs, focused \nII  more on the actions of the defendant than on whether those actions have a common effect on \n12 \neach of the Plaintiffs.  Walters v.  Reno (9th Cir., 1998) 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (\"Although common \n13 \nissues must predominate for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), no such reqllirement exists \n14 \nunder 23(b )(2).  It is sufficient if class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally \n15 \napplicable to the class as a whole.\"); Bynum v. District o/Columbia (D.C. 2003) 214 F.R.D. 27, \n16 \n37 -38 (certifYing class under 23(b )(2) based on a consistent pattern of activity of overdetaining \n17 \n18  inmates even though the circumstances of each detention differed).  The Court would not address \n19  variations in damages because damages would not be sought.  Mendoza v. County of Tulare \n20 \n(1982) 128 Cal. App. 3d 403, 418-419.  The Court would not address variations in individual \n21 \ninjunctive relief because Plaintiff would be seeking injunctive relief on the system level and not \n22 \nas applied to specific individuals.  Baby Neal/in' & by Kanter v Casey (Jrd Cir., 1994) 43 F.3d \n23 \n48,64 (\"The district court will thus not need to make individual, case-by-case determinations in \n24 \norder to assess liability or order relief.  Rather, the court can fashion precise orders to address \n25 \nspecific, system-wide deficiencies and then monitor compliance relative to those orders.\")  The \n26 \n3 \n\nCourt would also pay closer attention to the adequacy analysis because individual absent class \n2  members would not be permitted to opt out of the class and seek inconsistent injunctive relief \n3 \nand think more carefully about whether classwide injunctive relief is the best means to address \n4 \nand remedy the alleged wrongdoing. \n5 \n6 \nDEFINING THE CLAIMS ASSERTED. \n7 \nClass certification is determined with reference to the claims asserted and the court may \nR \ntake into account whether a class is appropriate for each claim.  Hicks v. Kaufman & Broad \n9 \nIII  Home Corp. (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 908, 916 fn22 and 917-918.  In this case, the Plaintiffs and \nII  Defendants approach the claims very differently. \n12 \nPlaintiffs take a collective approach to their claims rather than focusing on discrete legal \n13 \ntheories or discrete alleged wrongs.  (P reply at 7: I 0-18.)  This approach was adopted by the trial \n14 \ncourt in Marisol A. by Forbes v.  Giuliani (2nd Cir., 1997) 126 F Jd 372, where the trial court \n15 \ncertified a class and held that the common question of law was \"whether each child has a legal \n16 \nentitlement to the services of which that child is being deprived\" and the common question of \n17 \nIX  fact was \"whether defendants systematically have failed to provide these legally mandated \n19  services.\"  The trial court \"determined that the myriad constitutional, regulatory, and statutory \n21l \nprovisions invoked by the plaintiffs are properly understood as creating a single scheme for the \n21 \ndelivery of child welfare services\" and that the failure of that single scheme was a \"super-claim\" \n22 \ncommon to all members of the class.  The Second Circuit deferred to the trial cOUli's discretion \n23 \nin certifying a class but also noted that it might unfairly prejudice the defendants if the case were \n24 \ntried without the use of subclasses to refine the claims. \n25 \n26 \n4 \n\nDefendants argue that the Court must review the legal theories identified in the Fifth \n2  Amended Complaint and groups them in four categories: (1) Lanterman Act (cause of action 1); \n3 \n(2) Disability discrimination (causes of action 2, 3, and 4); (3) Constitutional violations \n4 \ninalienable rights, due process, equal protection (causes of action 5 and 6); and (4) Medicaid \n5 \n(cause of action 7),  This approach is more consistent with California law.  This approach was \n6 \nalso noted with approval in.!B. by Hart v.  Valdez (lO'h Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d 1280, 1289, where \n7 \nthe Plaintiffs alleged \"that systemic failures in the defendants' child welfare delivery system deny \n8 \nall members of the class access to legally-mandated services which plaintiffs need because of \n9 \n10  their disabilities.\" The Court found that an allegation of systematic failures does not create a \n11  common legal issue and stated \"For a common question of law to exist, the putative class must \n12 \nshare a discrete legal question of some kind.\" \n13 \nThis Court will not adopt the Guliani \"super-claim\" approach because it would lead to an \n14 \ninherently unmanageable trial.  The Court finds that it is more appropriate in this motion and in \n15 \nthis case to focus on the alleged wrongs than on the discrete legal theories alleged.  California \n16 \nSupreme Court authority suggests that either approach is pel111issible.  Compare Sav-On, 34 \n17 \n18  Cal.4'h at 324 (Court did not analyze separately the claims under the Labor Code, the UCL, and \n19  the common law because all claims concerned whether putative class members were \n20 \nmisclassified as exempt from the overtime laws) with Fletcher v. Security Pacific National Bank \n21 \n(1979) 23 Cal.3d 442, 447-454 (Court separately analyzed contract and fraud UCL claims even \n22 \nthough both claims concerned bank's uniform practices in calculating interest). \n23 \nThe discrete alleged wrongs at the center of Plaintiffs' claims concern primarily the \n24 \ndevelopment and implementation ofindividual Program Plans (\"IPPs\").  These wrongs are: (I) \n25 \nfailure to provide understandable information in the IPP process; (2) inadequate assessments in \n26 \n5 \n\nthe IPP process, (3) basing IPP recommendations on factors (institutional inertia and budget \n2  considerations) unrelated to the needs and choices of the disabled persons; (4) failure to provide \nJ \ntimely services and supports as suggested by IPPs; and (5) failure to develop adequate \n4 \ncommunity resources.  Plaintiffs and Defendants both focused on these alleged wrongs. (P \n5 \nMoving at 22; D Oppo at 14-18.) \n6 \n7 \nPRACTICALITY OF BRINGING ALL CLASS MEMBERS BEFORE THE COURT \n8 \n(NUMERIOSITY). \n9 \n10  Defendants do not contest numerosity.  The Court finds that the proposed class is \nII  numerous (approximately 7,800 persons). \n12 \n13 \nASCERTAINABILITY \n14 \nA class must be defined in temlS of objective characteristics and common transactional \n15 \nfacts making the ultimate identification of class members possible.  Hicks v.  Kaujinan and Broad \n16 \nHome Corp. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 908, 915; Barloid v.  Glendale Federal Bank (2000) 81 Cal. \n17 \n18  App. 4th 816, 828.  If the proposed class is not ascertainable, then the Court can and should \n19  redefine the class if the evidence suggests that a redefined class is ascertainable.  Hicks, 89 \n20 \nCaI.App.4!i1 at 916, fn 18.  At this stage of the proceedings a plaintiff is not required to establish \n21 \nthe existence and identity of class members.  Reyes v.  Board olSupervisors (1987) 196 \n22 \nCal.App.3d 1263, 1275. \n23 \nPlaintiffs' proposed class is ascertainable. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' proposed class \n24 \ndefinition is adequate.  It defines the members of the class in terms ofo bjective characteristics \n25 \nand common transactional facts that will make the ultimate identification of class members \n26 \n6 \n\npossible.  Plaintiffs did not suggest subclasses based on particular alleged failures in the system \n2  (all persons who did not get an IPP within X days) or based on alleged failures by individual \n3 \nRegional Centers (all persons served by Regional Center Y). \n4 \n5 \nCOMMONALITY - STANDARD APPROACH \n6 \nPlaintiffs' burden on moving for class certification is to show that common issues of fact \n7 \nand law predominate.  Lockheed Martin COfp. v. Superior Court (2003) 29 Cal.4'h 1096, 1108. \n8 \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that common factual issues \n9 \n10  predominate.  The trier of fact will need to consider in substantial measure how the policies \nII \naffect the individual class members.  There is no way for the trier of fact to find that Defendants \n12 \nhave failed to meet their statutory obligations without examining how individuals have been \n13 \naffected.  Given the many variables in each person's Individual Program Plan (\"iPP\"), the Court \n14 \nhas serious questions about whether the case could be tried based on anecdotes and statistical \n15 \ndata.  The necessary individual inquiries would overwhelm the common issues. \n16 \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that common legal issues \n17 \n18  predominate.  As held above, the Court will not pen11it Plaintiffs to proceed on a \"super-claim\" \n19  alleging that the DDS/Regional Center system is broken because it consistently fails to place \n20 \npersons in the least restrictive setting.  The Court will follow Hicks, supra, and JB. by Hart v. \n21 \nValdez (lO'h Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d 1280, 1289, and require Plaintiffs to identify common discrete \n22 \nwrongs that affect the individual classmembers.  The Court examines the discrete alleged wrongs \n23 \nidentified by the parties. \n24 \nThe claim that Defendants fail to provide understandable infon11ation in the IPP process. \n2S \n26  The evidence suggests that the IPPs are individualized and that much of the information is \n7 \n\nconveyed orally. This is not a case such as Vasquez v. Superior Court ofS an Joaquin County \n2  (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 800, 810-811, where the defendant had a script and the Court could assume that \n3 \nthe defendant made the same representations to each putative class member.  This case is more \n4 \nlike Hamwi v.  Citinational-Buckeye Inv.  Co. (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 462, 473, where the Court \n5 \ndenied certification because resolution of the contract claims would depend on individual \n6 \ndiscussions the defendant had with substantially all putative class members. \n7 \nThe claim that Defendants made inadequate assessments in the IPP process.  The \nS \nevidence suggests that each IPP is designed by a team of caregivers/specialists for an individual \n9 \n10  putative class member.  Although many IPPs may be inadequate, the evidence suggests that the \nII \nalleged legal deficiencies of each will be different. \n12 \nThe claim that Defendants base IPP recommendations on factors unrelated to the needs \n13 \nand choices of the disabled persons.  As with the above claim, the evidence suggests that \n14 \nalthough the recommendations in IPPs may not be based on the needs and choices of the disabled \n15 \npersons, the allegedly unlawful variables considered will be different for each IPP. \n16 \nThe claim that Defendants fail to provide timely services and supports as suggested by \n17 \nIX  IPPs.  IflPPs were similar, then this could be a common legal issue.  IflPPs were similar, then \n19  Plaintiffs could potentially review IPPs and determine that the Defendants had a common \n20 \npractice of unlawfully failing to provide timely services.  The evidence, however, suggests that \n21 \neach IPP is designed to meet the individual needs of the classmember.  The timing of services \n22 \nand supports will, therefore, be detennined by the circumstances of the individual.  The Court \n23 \ncannot determine that the DDS or a Regional Center acted unlawfully in every case where X \n24 \nservice was not provided to Y individual within Z weeks. \n25 \n26 \n8 \n\nThe claim that Defendants fail to develop adequate community resources.  This is \n2  potentially a common legal issue.  If Plaintiffs could prove that classmembers have a common \n3 \nlegal right to a ce11ain type of community resource and that the Defendants have not developed \n4 \nthe community resource and made it available for classmembers, then Plaintiffs could prevail on \n5 \na legal claim that was common to the class members.  This claim would, however, be dependent \n6 \non first proving that classmembers have a legal right to a certain type of community resource, and \n7 \nthat preliminary inquiry is inherently individualized. \n8 \nTherefore, under the standard commonality analysis, the C0U11 finds that Plaintiffs have \n9 \n10  not demonstrated that common issues of fact and law predominate. \nII \n12 \nCOMMONALITY - ALTERNATE APPROACH. \n13 \nBecause this case involves claims for injunctive relief only concerning alleged \n14 \nsystemwide deficiencies, the Court considers the alternative standard of whether Plaintiffs have \n15 \ndemonstrated that Defendants have \"acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \n16 \nthe class.\"  F.R.C.P.23(b)(2).  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendants \n17 \n18  have \"acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.\"  As in Sav-On, 34 \n19  Ca1.4th at 329-330, there is evidence that the Defendants had policies that were common and \n20 \naffected each member of the putative class.  The change in emphasis from the claims of the class \n21 \nmembers (not common) to the policies of the Defendants (common) leads to a different result. \n22 \n23 \nTYPICALITY OF REPRESENTATION. \n24 \nThe typicality analysis requires only that a named plaintiff share a community of interest \n25 \n26  with the class members and have claims and defenses typical of the class members.  Sav-On \n9 \n\nDrug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 319, 326 (The 'community of interest' \n2  requirement embodies three factors: '\"  (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical \n3 \nof the class; ... ).  The Court can find a named plaintiff to be typical of the class members even if \n4 \nthe named plaintiff s specific factual situation is not the same as the specific factual situation of \n5 \nall the other class members.  Fireside Bank v. Superior Court (2005) 133 Cal. App. 4th 742, 669-\n6 \n772 (named plaintiff held to be typical despite facts regarding how she bought vehicle and how \n7 \nvehicle was repossessed); Daniels v.  Centennial Group, Inc. (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 467, 473 \nR \n(plaintiff can be typical of the class of persons who differ in some particulars where the alleged \n9 \n10  misconduct is common).  A class representative's claims need not be identical to the claims of \nI I \nother class members and it is only required that the representative be similarly situated so that he \n12 \nor she will have the motive to litigate on behalf of all class members.  Classen v.  Weller (1983) \n13 \n145 Cal.App.3d 47, 46. \n14 \nThe individual plaintitTs are disabled persons who are or recently were receiving care \n15 \nfrom the Defendants.  The entity plaintiffs are organizations that represent the interests of their \n16 \nmembers and the members include substantial numbers of disabled persons who are or recently \n17 \n18  were receiving care from the Defendants.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are sufficiently typical \n19  of the class that they can represent the class. \n20 \n21 \nADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION. \n22 \nThe adequacy inquiry concern whether the named Plaintiffs interests are not antagonistic \n23 \nto the interests of the class and have selected counsel qualified to conduct the litigation.  McGhee \n24 \nv.  Bank ofA  merica (l976) 60 Cal.App.3d 442, 450.  See also Lazar v. Hertz Corp. (l983) 143 \n25 \n26  Cal.App.3d 128, 141-142. \n10 \n\nThis is a peculiar case because the Court can safely presume that all the class members \n2  would like thorough IPPs .and the best services possible.  The problem arises because each \n3 \ndisabled person is different and \"the best services possible\" for one person may not be \n4 \nappropriate for another person.  The named plaintiffs have consistently asserted that each class \n5 \nmember is entitled to live in the least restrained setting and that many will benefit from being \n6 \nremoved from large institutions and placed into community settings.  The Intervenors, however, \n7 \nargue that for many members of the class \"the best services possible\" are in large institutions and \nR \nthat it would be detrimental to place them in community settings. \n9 \n10  Class representatives assume a fiduciary responsibility to prosecute the action on behalf \nII \nof the absent parties and the structure of the class action does not normally allow absent class \nmembers to become active parties.  Earley v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1420, \nJ3 \n1434.  Therefore, the Court must be diligent in ensuring that the interests of the named plaintiff \n14 \nand class counsel do not overshadow the interests of the absent class members.  Apple Compuler, \n15 \nInc.  v. Superior Court (2005) 126 Cal. App. 4th 1253,1264-1274.  The Court emphasizes that \n16 \nthis is not a case such as J  P. Morgan & Co., Inc.  v. Superior Court (2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th \n17 \nIX  195, 212-215 (conflict between the interests of the named plaintiffs and certain members of the \n19  class) or Apple Computer, supra (concerns raised about the arguably improper self-interest of the \n21J \nnamed plaintiff and class counsel).  In this case the named plaintiffs are legitimately pursuing \n21 \nclaims that they honestly think are in the best interests of all the absent class members.  The \n22 \nproblem is that reasonable minds can differ and the Intervenors, who represent a sizeable number \n23 \nof absent class members, think that prosecution of the claims is not in their best interest. \n24 \nThe Court has considered whether the intra-class antagonism can be addressed by means \n25 \n26  other than denying class certification.  Addressing this point, Richmond v.  Dart industries, Inc. \nII \n\n(1981) 29 CaL 3d 462, 471-474, states, \"When a class contains various viewpoints, the courts \n2  may ensure that these viewpoints are represented by allowing them to join as interveners ...  or as \n3 \nadditional representatives of subclasses within the full class.  29 CaL3d at 473-474.  The Court \n4 \nhas already permitted the Intervenors to appear in this action, and they have had the opportunity \n5 \nto participate in all court proceedings.  The presence of the Intervenors protects their interests \n6 \nbecause they could present evidence and make arguments to the trier of fact. \n7 \nThe Court has also considered that because this case concerns systemwide injunctive \n8 \nrelief, the Intervenors cannot elect to opt-out of the class.  If the Court provides systemwide \n9 \n10  injunctive relief, then the policies of the DDS and the regional centers will have to change and \nII  those changes will necessarily affect all persons in the system. \n12 \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (I) they will adequately \n13 \nrepresent the interests of all the members of the proposed class or (2) the interests of the \n14 \nIntervenors can be adequately protected by their presence in this case.  This conclusion is based \n15 \non a balancing of interests and case management concerns and is not directed at the integrity or \n16 \ncompetence of the named plaintitTs. \n17 \n18  The Court holds that the named plaintitTs have retained competent counseL \n19 \n20 \nDETERRING AND REDRESSING THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING I ALTERNATIVE \n21 \nPROCEDURES FOR HANDLING THE CONTROVERSY. \n22 \nLinder states that trial courts have an obligation to consider the role of the class action in \n23 \ndeterring and redressing wrongdoing.  23 CaL 4th at 446.  In addition, the Court may consider the \n24 \navailability and suitability of alternative procedures for handling the controversy.  BasurcG.  108 \n25 \n26  CaL App. 4th at 120-122; CarG,  18 CaL App. 4th at 660-662. \n12 \n\nPlaintiffs state that the class settlement in Coffelt v.  DDS, San Francisco Case # 916401, \n2  in 1994 was instrumental in moving disabled persons from institutional to community settings \n3 \nand argue that this case should similarly be certified to proceed as a class action.  Defendants did \n4 \nnot argue in their briefs that an effective oversight mechanism is already in place, but did assert \n5 \nat the hearing that that the DDS and the Regional Centers are subject to extensive oversight and \n6 \nmonitoring ..  Compare Caro v.  Procter & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 Cal. App. 4th 644, 660 (no \n7 \nclass action necessary where defendant had already entered into various consent decrees). \n8 \nCourts have certified classes in cases alleging that government institutions such as \n9 \n10  schools, prisons, and social welfare programs do not adequately meet the needs of the persons \nII \nwho are served by those facilities.  A class action can often be the only effective tool to compel \n12 \ngovernment institutions operated by the Executive branch to meet the obligations imposed on \n13 \nthem by the Legislative branch.  In those cases, however, the class claims are generally discrete \n14 \nand capable of resolution by a court on a common basis.  For example, a court can determine \n15 \nwhether a policy of racial segregation is lawful without examining who is placed in what school \n16 \nor cell for what reason.  Likewise, a court can review a common policy and determine benefits \n17 \n18  are being paid in the proper amounts and at the p'roper times without examining who got what \n19  benefits at what time. \n20 \nIn this case, the Court finds that the alleged wrongs cannot be readily cured on a \n21 \nclasswide basis.  Unlike the policies in other government institutions that were the subject of \n22 \nother class actions, the development and implementation of the IPPs is inherently individualized. \n23 \nIn addition, the Legislature created a hearing procedure for disabled persons to seek relief when \n24 \nthey disagreed with their IPPs and treatment.  W&I4701-4716.  The Court presumes that the \n25 \n26  Legislature considered this to be an effective means for individuals to seek relief. \n13 \n\n2  SUMMARY. \n3 \nIf the Court applies the standard commonality analysis, then it is clear that class \n4 \ncertification is not proper given the individualized factual and legal issues the trier of fact would \n5 \nneed to consider in reaching a decision.  Because the standard commonality analysis is the \n6 \nsoundest basis for its decision, the Court applies this analysis and denies the motion for class \n7 \ncertification. \n8 \nIf the Court were to apply the alternate analysis based on F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2) for class \n9 \n10  claims seeking irljunctive relief only, then the Court would find that Plaintiffs have demonstrated \nII \nthat Defendants have \"acted or retLrsed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.\"  The \n12 \nCourt would, however, still deny the motion for class certification because the claims asserted \n13 \nwould require the trier of fact to pay significant attention to the individual circumstances of class \n14 \nmembers.  The trier of fact cannot avoid the reality that each IPP is individualized in its \n15 \ndevelopment, content, and implementation, and this would restrict the use of sampling or \n16 \nstatistical proof at trial.  The Court finds that the presence of the Intervenors demonstrates that \n17 \n18  different class members have different goals, suggesting that claims should be made on an \n19  individual basis.  Finally, the Legislature created the fair hearing procedure under Welfare and \n211 \nInstitutions Code 4701-4716 and there is no indication that it is not an effective means for \n21 \nindividuals to seek relief. \n22 \n23 \nEVIDENCE \n24 \nExcept as stated otherwise, all evidentiary objections by the parties are OVERRULED. \n25 \n26  The Court notes, however, that its consideration of the evidence is limited to the motion for class \n14 \n\ncertification only and should not be construed as an indication of admissibility in future motions \n2  or at trial. \n3 \n4 \nMOTIONS TO SEAL \n5 \nThe motions to seal are GRANTED.  The Court has signed the proposed orders on the \n6 \nmotions to seal. \n7 \n8 \nFURTHER PROCEEDINGS \n9 \n10  The Court sets a case management conference for January 4,2006, at 2:00 p.m. \nII \nAt the case management conference the parties should also be prepared to discuss (I) \n12 \nwhether Plaintiffs intend to appeal from the class certification order; (2) whether the claims of \n13 \nthe named plaintiffs should be pursued in this action or in separate claims under W &1 470 I et \n14 \nseq.; (3) the nature, scope, and length of time expected to complete any merits related discovery; \n15 \n(4) further motion practice; (5) mediation and settlement possibilities; and (6) setting a trial date \n16 \nfor the individual claims, if any, of the named plaintiffs. \n17 \n,!  \n18 \n\\:···2-~~4!J \n19  Dated: December 10 ,2005 \nJudge Ronald M.

Sabraw. \nDate: February 8, 2006 \n  \nTime: 9:00 am. \n  \nDept.: 22 \n  \nVarious motions came on for hearing on February 8, 2006, in Department 22 of this Court, the Honorable Ronald M. Sabraw \npresiding. Counsel appeared on behalf of Plaintiffs and on behalf of Defendants. After consideration of the points and \nauthorities and the evidence, as well as the oral argument of counsel, IT IS ORDERED: \n  \n \nMOTIONS OF THE PLAINTIFFS FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS CONCERNING AFFIRMATIVE \nDEFENSES - GENERAL COMMENTS. \nPlaintiffs bring these motions 4 years after Defendants served their answers and notified Plaintiffs of the affirmative defenses. \nAt this point in the case, the parties have had significant time to conduct discovery regarding the factual basis for the \naffirmative defenses. For example, in May 2003 the State Defendants served responses to form interrogatories that set forth \nthe facts, if any, that supported the affirmative defenses. In this context the Court would ordinarily take a dim view of \narguments that the affirmative defenses are not clear or are not supported by factual allegations. \n  \nThese motions are also brought after Court has denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Therefore, the affirmative \ndefenses now relate to the named plaintiffs and not to a putative class of plaintiffs. It is unclear whether the writ relief \nrequested concerns just the named plaintiffs or all the persons who receive services from defendants. In light of the change in \nthe posture of this case, further clarification of the affirmative defenses through the pleadings or I discovery is appropriate. \n  \n \n1 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al, Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3544580...   \n \n \nMOTIONS OF THE PLAINTIFFS FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS CONCERNING AFFIRMATIVE \nDEFENSES - STATE DEFENDANTS. \nAffirmative Defense #1 (Failure to state a claim).

This \ndiscovery motion concerns the original 11 plaintiffs and must be viewed in the context of the current procedural posture of \nthis case. The Court has denied the motion of Plaintiffs for class certification. Defendants are entitled to discovery responses \nthat clarify the claims of each of the 11 originally named plaintiffs. \n  \nThe Court appreciates Plaintiffs’ efforts to use tables in their discovery responses. Where, as here, the parties are collecting \nand sharing significant amounts of information it is often useful to be creative in organizing and presenting information to \nmake it useful and accessible to the parties, the Court, and the trier of fact. \n  \nPlaintiffs must provide supplemental responses that clarify the claims of each plaintiff. There should be a separate response \nfor each named plaintiff that contains information about his or her background (as in Appendix A) together with information \nabout his or her specific claims (an in the “for example” sections of Appendix B). For direct service providers, the responses \nshould state the facts related to each plaintiff (e.g. “The Regional Center did not inform NAME of XYZ in the 2003 IPP \nmeeting in violation of CITE”). Information concerning the named plaintiffs is not equally available to Defendants because \nthe interrogatories are in the nature of contention interrogatories. Even though all parties may have the underlying medical \nrecords, only Plaintiffs know what actions and inactions are the subject of the lawsuit. \n  \nFor claims that are common among all the plaintiffs, there can be a common response. For direct and indirect service \nproviders where the claims of the 11 originally named plaintiffs concern policies and practices, there can be a single, more \ngeneral, response that relates to all plaintiffs (e.g. “The Regional Centers did not provide adequate information to customers \nin violation of CITE;” “The Department of Finance failed to monitor whether the Regional Centers were providing adequate \ninformation to customers as required by CITE”). \n  \nPlaintiffs must provide information concerning the policies and practices for providing services and supports to persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities that may include data compilations or summaries that will ultimately be presented by experts. The \nanticipated use of experts at trial to prove a fact does not preclude all discovery on that fact. Plaintiffs must provide \ninformation that is known currently, but are not required to retain experts to provide responses to interrogatories. If Plaintiffs \nexpect to obtain expert information before trial, Plaintiffs’ discovery responses may state that certain information will be the \nsubject of expert testimony and summarize briefly what Plaintiffs expect the experts to state. \n  \nPlaintiffs must provide data obtained and compiled by counsel. Smith v. Superior Court of San Joaquin County (1961) 189 \nCal. App. 2d 6, 11-12. Plaintiffs must provide responses to contention interrogatories, but are not required to explain the legal \nreasoning behind the contentions. \n  \nIn an effort to limit the administrative burden, Plaintiffs might prepare a draft tentative response for a single plaintiff and \nshare it with the State Defendants before preparing responses for all plaintiffs. \n  \nPlaintiffs  are  not  required  to  update  their  discovery  responses  as  additional  information  becomes  available.  C.C.P. \n2030.310(a). Defendants may request supplemental responses. C.C.P. 2030.070. \n5 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al, Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3544580...   \n \n \n  \n \nMOTION OF STATE DEFENDANTS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL \nINTERROGATORIES, SET #8. \nMotion of State Defendants to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set #8 is GRANTED IN PART. This \ndiscovery motion concerns the 5 additional plaintiffs who were added as parties in the Fifth Amended Complaint as permitted \nby the Court order dated June 24, 2005. Defendants are entitled to discovery responses that clarify the claims of each of the 5 \nadditional plaintiffs. Plaintiffs must provide further responses to Set #8 Special Interrogatories # 3, 4, 10, 11, 17, 18, 19, and \n23. The general guidance regarding Set #7 is applicable to Set #8. \n  \n \nMOTION OF PLAINTIFFS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DEPOSITION QUESTIONS. \nMotion of Plaintiffs to compel further responses to deposition questions is DENIED. This motion concerns the relevance of \nthe information and whether it is protected as “official information” under Evidence Code 1040. \n  \nRelevance. Plaintiffs argue that the decision making process of Defendants is at issue in this case, so information concerning \nthat process is material to the trial. The State Defendants argue that the intent, motive, and attitudes are irrelevant to the case \nbecause either the Defendants are complying with the legal requirements or they are not. \n  \nThe issue of relevance concerns the nature of the claims asserted as well as the parameters of a writ of mandate. Therefore, \nthe Court has reviewed the Fifth Amended Complaint, the Court of Appeal decision dated April 30, 2004, this Court’s order \ndated October 5, 2005, and the Court of Appeal decision dated March 23, 2005. Plaintiffs are seeking a traditional writ of \nmandate under C.C.P. 1085. Plaintiffs assert that Defendants have (1) failed to perform clear, present, and ministerial duties \nand (2) have adopted formal or de facto policies or practices that are in violation of the Lanterman Act. The Plaintiffs claims \nin this case are based primarily on an alleged violations of various statutes and regulations resulting in violation of the \nLanterman  Act.  See  Fifth  Amended  Complaint,  Paragraph  230(a)-(t).  In  addition,  plaintiffs  assert  claims  under  the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act and various federal Medicaid provisions. Plaintiffs do not allege state Defendants have \nimproperly exercised quasi-legislative powers. See Fifth Amended Complaint, Paragraph 231. \n  \nCuriously, Plaintiffs rely on, inter alia,  Ass’n for Retarded Citizens v. Dep’t of Developmental Services, (1985) 38 Cal. 3d \n384, 390-393; and  Bright Dev. v. City of Tracy (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 783, 795. Unlike the claims in Ass’n for Retarded \nCitizens, the claims in this case are not based upon the exercise by Defendants of quasi-legislative administrative powers. \n(See Paragraph 231 of Fifth Amended Complaint.) The holding in Assoc. for Retarded Citizens is that to be valid, \nquasi-legislative administrative action must be within the scope of authority conferred by the enabling statute. And while the \ninterpretation of the administrative agency is to be given great weight regarding its statutory authority, the final responsibility \nfor the interpretation of the law rests with the courts. See Assoc. of Retarded Citizens, supra, at page 390 and 391. The \nSupreme Court goes on to note “Thus, if the court concludes that the administrative action transgresses the agency’s statutory \nauthority, it need not proceed to review the action for abuse of discretion; in such a case, there is simply no discretion to \nabuse.”  Association of Retarded Citizens v. Dept. of Developmental Services, (1985) 38 Cal. 3d 384, at 391. Thus, in the \nquasi-legislative area, the final statutory interpretation rests with the courts and the intent, motive or rationale of the agency \nwould not be relevant. It is simply whether the agency’s action is in or out of compliance with the statute. \n  \nAs noted above, the Plaintiffs claims in this case are based primarily on an alleged violation of the Lanterman Act. See Fifth \nAmended Complaint, Paragraph 230(a)-(t). Plaintiffs challenge state defendants conduct or failure to act. The only relevant \ninquiry is whether the agency’s conduct or failure to act violates the law. Thus, it would appear that the state Defendant’s \nintent, motive, or rationale for its action or inaction are irrelevant to the Court’s inquiry. \n  \n6 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al, Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3544580...   \n \n \nThere is a distinction between the alleged adoption of improper policies and practices (a quasi-legislative administrative \naction) and the application of those policies and practices to individual Plaintiffs (a quasi-adjudicative administrative action). \nMileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 531, 554. The Plaintiffs in this action are not seeking the \nreview of specific administrative decisions under  C.C.P. 1094.5(a) and are not seeking traditional writ review of \nadjudicatory decisions,  Stone v. Regents of University of California 20 (1999) 77 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745. \n  \nBased on the nature of Plaintiffs claims, Defendants’ decision-making process and the rationale for their ultimate decisions \nare not relevant to the duty to perform clear, present, and ministerial duties. Either the Defendants are required to perform the \nministerial duties or they are not required to perform those duties. \n  \nSimilarly, Defendants’ decision-making process is not relevant to whether Defendants have adopted formal or de facto \npolicies or practices that are contrary to the relevant statutes and regulations. If the policies or practices are lawful, then it \ndoes not matter whether they were arrived as through random chance or careful deliberation. It follows then, if the policies or \npractices are not lawful, then they will not become lawful because the Defendants had a lengthy and thorough deliberative \nprocess before reaching an unlawful result. \n  \nDefendants’ contemporaneous rationale for a particular decision would be relevant if Plaintiffs were seeking a writ of \nmandamus asking that the Court review whether a quasi-adjudicative decision was consistent with the agency’s statutory \nauthority and the agency’s policies and practices. For example, whether the administrative record supports the agency’s \ndecision in its development and implementation of an IPP for a particular individual plaintiff. In such an instance the Court \nwould be reviewing the agency’s adjudicative decision in order to determine whether the decision “was arbitrary, capricious, \nor entirely lacking in evidentiary support.” ( Sequoia Union High School Dist. v. Aurora Chart High School (2003) 112 \nCal. App. 4th 185, 195. In the context of reviewing adjudicative decisions,  McBail & Co. v. Solano County Local Agency \nFormation Com. (1998) 62 Cal. App. 4th 1223, 1230, and  Ridgecrest Charter School v. Sierra Sands Unified School \n(2005) 130 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1006-1007, suggest that although agencies are not required to prepare formal written \nstatements concerning each decision, the record of the administrative hearing must adequately reflect the reason and basis for \nthe decision. To the extent that the claims concern matters such as the development and implementation of IPPs for specific \nindividuals, then Plaintiffs could arguably inquire into the rationale for those decisions because they are adjudicative in \nnature. But the claims in this case do not implicate any of state Defendants quasi-adjudicative decisions. \n  \n“Official Information” privilege under Evidence Code 1040. \n  \nThere may be instances where tension exists in writ of mandamus proceedings on the one hand where the Court is required to \nreview the evidence relied on by administrative agencies in making quasi-legislative or quasi-adjudicative decisions, and \nEvidence Code 1040(b)(2) on the other, which protects the deliberative process of government entities. See  Times Mirror \nCo. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal. 3d 1325, 1126; Marylander v. Superior Court (2000) 81 Cal. App. 4th 1119 1126. \nHowever, there appears to be no such tension in the case before the Court. The Plaintiffs claims against the state Defendants \nin the Fifth Amended Complaint are directed at the state’s alleged violation of various statutes and regulations leading to a \nviolation of the Lanterman Act. The state Defendant’s plans, policies, practices and procedures are either in violation of the \nLanterman or they are not. The state Defendants intentions, motives, rationale or desires are simply not relevant to the inquiry \nbefore the Court. \n  \nIn light of the above analysis, the Court offers the following guidelines for the future. Information that concerns the intent, \nmotive, rationale, discussions and the deliberative process of state Defendants is not relevant to the Court’s review and is \npresumptively protected under Evidence Code 1040 to ensure the honest exchange of information within government entities. \nIn contrast, information that concerns the ultimate rationale of Defendants for the decisions at issue is directly relevant to the \nCourt’s review and would not be protected under Evidence Code 1040 because government entities can be legitimately \nexpected to explain the ultimate rationale and bases for their decisions. The final reasons, rationales and determinations of the \nstate Defendants are discoverable. State witnesses may be expected to testify about what the agency’s policies, practices and \nprocedures are, and why such policies are what they are. This would not include, however, the internal discussions, debates, \nand alternatives that did not find their way into the final practices and polices of the agency. Such internal, discussions and \n7 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al, Plaintiffs, v...., 2006 WL 3544580...   \n \n \ndebates are covered by Evidence Code Section 1040. \n  \nAs applied in this case, a deponent can, therefore, be asked why an agency decided to take a certain course of conduct or \nadopted a particular policy. A Defendant may, however, object and elect not to explain how that decision was reached, what \nalternatives were considered, whether there was internal dissent, or refuse to provide other information that concerns the \ninternal decision-making process. To the extent that Defendants assert the “official information” privilege regarding their \ndecision-making processes, the options they considered, their intent, motives, and attitudes, the Court will preclude the \nDefendants from presenting such evidence at trial in defense of Defendants ultimate policies, procedures and practices and \nthe decision-making processes leading to the same. \n  \nCounsel are directed to apply these general principles to the identified deposition questions. If Counsel cannot do so, then the \nCourt will reconsider this matter when the stay is lifted. \n  \n \nMOTIONS TO SEAL \nThe motions to seal are GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed orders on the motions to seal. \n  \n \nMOTION TO STAY. \nOn February 6, 2006, Plaintiffs filed an appeal from the order of the Court denying the motion for class certification. \nTherefore, to the extent the case concerns class claims the case is stayed automatically by C.C.P. 916. \n  \nThe Court GRANTS the motion of Plaintiffs to stay the case in its entirety. The scope of discovery in this case might vary \ndepending on how the appeal is resolved, so discovery will be impeded until the class certification issue is resolved. The case \nhas been pending for four years and Plaintiffs are justifiably concerned about stopping the running of the five year statute \nwhile the appeal is pending. C.C.P. 583.340. \n  \nWhile the stay is in effect Defendants are not required to file the amended answers required by this order and the parties are \nnot required to provide the further discovery responses required by this order. Any motion to lift the stay should propose due \ndates for these outstanding matters. While the stay is in effect, the Court will remain available to assist in voluntary \nsettlement conferences. \n  \n \nFURTHER PROCEEDINGS. \nThe Court sets the next CMC for December 18, 2006, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 22. If the appeal is not resolved at that \ntime, the Court will entertain an informal request to continue the CMC date for 6-9 months. If the appeal is resolved \nsignificantly before that time, the Court will entertain an informal request to set a CMC date promptly after the decision of \nthe Court of Appeal. \n  \n \nDated: March 6, 2006  <<signature>> \n     \n   \n  Judge Ronald M.

They assert that illegal institutionalization does not rise to the level of a \nconstitutional violation, whether state or federal. State Defendants’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of \nTheir Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Verified Complaint (State Defs’ Brief) at 1. In fact, illegal institutionalization most definitely \ninfringes on federal and state constitutional liberty interests. Plaintiffs allege that they and the class they represent are \ninstitutionalized in violation of their substantive due process liberty interest due to defendants’ failure to properly exercise \nprofessional judgment, or to provide residential services and supports in accord with professional judgment. These claims are \nnot only valid they are also typical of claims alleging unlawful institutionalization of people with disabilities raised in similar, \nprimarily federal, actions throughout the country. In addition, as has been alleged in other institutional litigation, unlawful \nand unnecessary segregation and isolation of plaintiffs and class members in institutional settings without any rational basis \nviolates their constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws and infringes on their constitutional rights to freedom of \nexpression and association. The facts alleged in the complaint are more than sufficient to state causes of action under the \nCalifornia and federal Constitutions. \n  \nState defendants also argue that the State of California is not a proper party against which relief may be granted. No authority \nsupports the contention that the State may not be sued for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circumstances of this case. \n  \nFACTS \nState defendants have adequately summarized the pertinent facts as alleged; therefore plaintiffs will not restate them here. \n  \nARGUMENT \n4 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \nI. A DEMURRER MUST BE DENIED IF THE COMPLAINT, ON ITS FACE, STATES A CAUSE OF ACTION. \nA demurrer lies only where the ground for objection to a complaint appears on the face of the complaint or from any matter \nof which the court is required to or may take judicial notice. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a). A general demurrer challenges the \ncomplaint or the particular claim or claims to which it is directed to determine the legal sufficiency of the causes of action \npleaded. The court must overrule the demurrer if any valid cause of action is pleaded. E.g., Gruenberg v. Aetna Insurance \nCo. Inc., 9 Cal.3d 566, 572 (1973). A demurrer is not the proper procedure to challenge the relief sought by an otherwise \nvalid cause of action. Venice Town Council, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 47 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1561-62 (1996). Moreover, a \ngeneral demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action. If there are sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiffs to relief, \nother allegations cannot be challenged by general demurrer. Financial Corp. of America v. Wilburn, 189 Cal.App.3d 764, 778 \n(1987). \n  \nFor the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly \npleaded no matter how unlikely. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint. Serrano \nv. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 (1971); Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co., 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (1981). \n  \nII. PLAINTIFFS HAVE SUFFICIENTLY ALLEGED FACTS TO SUPPORT THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL \nCONSTITUTIONAL CAUSES OF ACTION. \nA. Confinement in an Institution Affects Substantive Liberty Interests. \nCalifornia and federal courts have consistently recognized the impact of involuntary institutionalization of people with \ndisabilities on their fundamental liberty interests. In In re Hop, 29 Cal.3d 82, 89 (1982), the California Supreme Court noted: \n‘[PJersonal liberty is a fundamental interest, second only to life itself...’ [quoting People v. Olivas, 17 Cal.3d 236, 251 \n(1976)]. See also, e.g., Conservatorship ofRoulet, 23 Cal.3d 219, 225 (1979) (Regardless of the purposes for which the \nincarceration is imposed, the fact remains that it is incarceration (citing Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 530, n. 12 (1975)); \nPeople  v.  Burnick,  14  Cal.3d  306,  323  (1975)  (civil  commitment  entails  a  ‘massive  curtailment  of  liberty’  in  the \nconstitutional sense (citing Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509 (1972)). \n  \nThe State Supreme Court has also noted that involuntary confinement is a direct form of physical restraint. And [i]t is beyond \ndispute that a principal ingredient of personal liberty is ‘freedom from bodily restraint’ [citation].... In re Roger S., 19 Cal.3d \n921, 929 (1977). So substantial is the impact of institutional confinement on the liberty interest, that the Court has held that \ninvoluntary confinement in a state psychiatric hospital or state developmental center cannot be effected under the California \nConstitution without the application of criminal due process standards. E.g., Conservatorship of Roulet, 23 Cal.Sd at 224-25; \nIn re Hop, 29 Cal.Sd at 89. \n  \nThe rights plaintiffs seek to protect by this action include substantive rights protected against arbitrary deprivation by the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 1, § 1 of the California Constitution. They encompass the right to \nhabilitation, a right which the State Supreme Court has held is entitled to constitutional protection - i.e., the right of every \ncitizen to have the personal liberty to develop, whether by education training, labor, or simply fortuity, to his or her \nmaximum economic, intellectual, and social level.... It lies at the core of the liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment... and Article 1, section 1 of the California Constitution. Conservatorship of Valerie N., 40 Cal.Sd 143, 162-63 \n(1985). \n  \nB. The Complaint Sufficiently States Causes of Action for Violation of Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Rights \nUnder the California and United States Constitutions. \n1. The Fourteenth Amendment Protects Against Institutionalization Not Based on the Exercise of Reasonable \nProfessional Judgment. \n5 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \nThe mere fact that someone has been institutionalized under proper procedures does not deprive that person of all substantive \nliberty interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315 (1982).1 Institutionalized persons \nhave a constitutional liberty interest in, and substantive due process right to safety, freedom from harm, freedom from undue \nrestraint, and adequate habilitation. Id. at 322. In Youngberg, the Court held that, in determining whether these rights have \nbeen violated, the Constitution only requires that the courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised and \nfurther held that courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by qualified professionals, Id, at 321-22. The Court \nleft it to lower courts to decide what constitutes a departure from professional judgment.2 Id. at 319. \n  \nSince Youngberg, numerous federal appellate and district courts have applied the professional judgment standard and have \nheld that community placement is proper relief for violations of institutional residents’ rights under the Due Process Clause to \nfreedom  from  harm,  freedom  from  undue  restraint  (which  includes  inappropriate  instirutionalization),  and  adequate \nhabilitation.3 E.g., Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990); Clark v. \nCohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3rd Cir. 1986), cert, denied, 479 U.S. 962 (1986); Thomas S. by Brooks v. Morrow, 781 F.2d 367 (4th \nCir. 1986), cert. denied by Kirk v. Thomas S. by Brooks, 476 U.S. 1124, and cert, denied by Childress v. Thomas S., 479 U.S. \n869 (1986); Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hospital and Training School, 757 F.Supp. 1243 (D.N.M. 1990) rev ‘d in part, appeal \ndismissed in part, 964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992); Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, 1987 Westlaw 27104 \n(N.D. Okla.1987); Kirsch v. Thompson, 111 F.Supp. 1077 (E.D. Pa. 1988). \n  \nContinued institutionalization in the face of professional judgment determining that institutionalization is unnecessary has \nbeen held to violate substantive due process rights based on Youngberg. In Messier v. Southbury Training School, 916 \nF.Supp. 133, 140 (D. Conn. 1996), for example, the court, citing Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 \nF.2d 1239, 1249 (2d Cir. 1984), held that whereas ‘there is no constitutional right to community placement,’ a decision to \nkeep a resident in an institutional rather than community setting is only constitutional to the extent that it is a ‘rational \ndecision based on professional judgment,’ The court further held that allegations that defendants failed to consider all \nresidents for possible community placement, as would be required by professional judgment states a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted. Id. \n  \nSimilarly, in Clark v. Cohen, the Third Circuit held that institutionalization of an individual with mental retardation in the \nface of unanimous professional opinion that she should be placed in a far less restrictive environment violated her substantive \nright to appropriate treatment under Youngberg. 794 F.2d at 87. Continued institutionalization in the face of professionals’ \ndetermination that institutionalization was unwarranted, the court held, violated the resident’s substantive due process rights \nbased on Youngberg. Citing Youngberg, the district court in Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center held that \nfreedom from bodily restraint includes the right to be free from confinement in an institution where such confinement is \nshown on a factual basis to be unnecessary. 1987 WL 27104 at 15; see also, Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hospital and Training \nSchool, 757 F.Supp. at 1312 (holding that institutional residents’ Youngberg rights were violated when they remained \ninstitutionalized because appropriate community services were not available, despite the professional judgment of their teams \nthat they should be placed in the community).4 \n  \nSubstantive due process rights are also violated when evidence demonstrates that professional judgment was not, in fact, \nexercised or was exercised by unqualified individuals. Decisions must be made by a person competent, whether by education, \ntraining or experience, to make the particular decision at issue. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323 n.30. \n  \nAnother factor considered on the issue of whether professional judgment has been exercised is adherence to applicable state \nlaw or standards. In Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266,269 (3rd Cir. 1983), for example, the court referred to the state standard \nfor denial of the right to refuse antipsychotic drugs - danger to himself or others. Consideration of the validity of professional \njudgments, the appellate court held, involves application of the applicable state standard. Id.; see also, Brooks v. Pataki, 908 \nF.Supp. 1142,1151-52 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (procedures for transferring people with developmental and psychiatric disabilities \nfrom out-of-state to in-state institutions did not meet professional judgment standard because they were at variance with the \nstate’s previously planned process and with procedures specified in state law); Thomas S.by Brooks v. Flahertyt 902 F.2d at \n252 (finding that professional judgment had not been exercised because the decisions of the treating professionals departed \nfrom accepted standards, including the state’s written policies). \n  \nProfessional judgment has also been found to be lacking in instances where decision-making is based on what resources are \navailable rather than on what is appropriate. The district court in Thomas S., for example, found that severe lack of \n6 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \ncommunity resources for persons with plaintiffs’ needs resulted in unnecessary confinement of plaintiffs in highly restrictive \nsettings and frustrate[d] the exercise of professional judgment by mental health and mental retardation professionals who \nbecame discouraged by the futility, year after year, of recommending services that do not exist. Thomas S. by Brooks v. \nFlaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178,1195 (W.D.N.C. 1988). Professional judgment probably was not exercised if it was ‘modified to \nconform to available treatment rather than appropriate treatment.’ Id. at 1200. See also, Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 673 F.Supp. 828, \n835  (N.D.  Tex.  1987)  (Deference  to  professional  judgment  requires  that ‘the  decision  be  one  based  on  medical or \npsychological criteria and not on exigency, administrative convenience, or other non-medical criteria.’ (Citing Clark v. \nCohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 704 and n.13)). \n  \nCommunity placement has also been ordered upon findings of violations of other Youngberg rights - for example, undue \nrestraint, and/or inadequate habilitation. The Second Circuit has interpreted Youngberg to encompass a right to training \nsufficient to prevent basic self-care skills from deteriorating. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, 737 F.2d at 1250. \nIn  Thomas  S.,  the  district  court  found  that  the  institutions  where  plaintiffs  resided  provided  very  abnormal  living \nenvironments, where class members tended to copy inappropriate behavior and had little hope of maintaining or improving \ntheir self-care skills. They learn to live in an institution, and their ability to be integrated into the community and adapt to \ncommunity life deteriorates. 699 F.Supp. 1193-94. In Homeward Bound, Inc. v. The Hissom Memorial Center, among the \nharm that the court found endemic in the institutional environment were regression and other harm arising from segregation \nand confinement; lack of privacy, including having to spend days together in day rooms and eating in large groups; and loss \nor reduction in skills. 1987 WL 27104 at 20. \n  \n2. Plaintiffs Seek Appropriate Relief on Behalf of Class Members. \nState defendants cite Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d at 1241, and other cases for the unexceptional conclusion that there is no \nconstitutional right to treatment in the least restrictive environment. State Defs’ Brief at 8. The court’s decision in Lelsz, \nhowever, provides no authority for a court to deny relief when it finds that institutional residents are not provided the \nconstitutional minimum standard of habilitation at the institution and that the defendants’ own professional judgment is that \nthey should receive services in another setting. State defendants also cite the appellate decision in Society for Good Will to \nthe Retarded Children v. Cuomo which similarly held that, under the Youngberg standards, no right exists to training in the \nleast restrictive environment. On the other hand, the court held, [w]e may rule only on whether a decision to keep residents at \nSDC is a rational decision based on professional judgment. 737 F.2d at 1249. \n  \nThe relief plaintiffs seek in this case is unquestionably within the traditional equitable powers of the court. As discussed in \nthe previous section, community placement frequently has been held to be appropriate relief for violations of substantive due \nprocess rights resulting from inappropriate institutionalization. A decision concerning the appropriate relief can be rendered \nonly after a determination on the merits.5 \n  \n(3.) State Defendants Owe a Duty to Institutionalized Persons Even if Their Placements Are Deemed Voluntary. \nDefendants also argue that they owe no duty to plaintiffs or class members who have been institutionalized voluntarily.6 State \nDefs’ Brief at 8 and n. 1. As authority, they cite DeShaney v, Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 \n(1989); Fialkowski v. Greenwich Home for Children, Inc., 921 F.2d 459 (3rd Cir. 1990); and Philadelphia Police and Fire \nAss’n, 874 F.2d 156 (3rd Cir. 1989). Regardless of the form of plaintiffs’ and class members’ admissions, the cases cited are \ninapposite. \n  \nThe cases State defendants cite dealt with persons who are not in any form of custody, voluntary or not, of the defendants \nwho were alleged to have harmed them. And even if this court were to find that some class members are not in custody of the \ndefendants, the plaintiffs still would be entitled to relief because the injuries they have experienced are harms caused directly \nby persons acting under color of state law, rather than by private parties as in DeShaney. \n  \nIn Philadelphia Police and Fire Ass ‘n, the state did not participate in the harm experienced by the plaintiffs, either as \ncustodian, supervisor or direct actor. The court held that the state had no// affirmative constitutional duty to continue services \n7 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \nto clients of the county mental retardation program who lived at home with their families. 874 F.2d at 168. None of the \nplaintiffs lived in a residential facility operated by the state or its contractors. \n  \nThe Third Circuit’s opinion in Fialkowski likewise has no applicability here because it dealt with the liability of a defendant \nwho provided no residential service to the plaintiff. Moreover, Fialkowski was decided on summary judgment, not on a \nmotion to dismiss. The decision turned on an analysis of the factual relationship between the state and the service provider. \nThe court noted that the state might have been liable for constitutional violations had the facts established that it was acting \npursuant to a policy - i.e., a ‘deliberate’ or ‘conscious’ choice not to provide training regarding certain potential constitutional \nviolations as opposed to showing only that “an otherwise sound program had occasionally been negligently administered’.... \n921 F.2d at 467. \n  \nMore to the point, other courts addressing the issue on facts similar to those here have held that the voluntary nature of \nadmissions to institutions has no bearing on application of the Youngberg standards. E.g., Thomas S., 699 F.Supp. at 1185; \nSociety for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d at 1245-46 and n. 4; United States v. State of Tennessee, 798 \nF.Supp. 483,487 (W.D. Term. 1992). The California Supreme Court has noted, moreover, that the notion of voluntariness \nwith respect to institutional admissions of people with cognitive impairments is often a fiction. In re Hop, 29 Cal.3d at 90-91. \nEven if relevant, the voluntary versus involuntary nature of plaintiffs’ and class members’ institutional placements is, in any \nevent, a factual matter which cannot be decided on demurrer. \n  \n4. The Complaint Alleges Sufficient Facts to State a Claim for Violation of Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Rights \nUnder the State and Federal Constitutions. \nThe complaint alleges facts that sufficiently state a cause of action for violation of plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights \nunder the Youngberg standard as it has been applied in numerous post-Youngberg cases, including those discussed above. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that defendants fail to exercise professional judgment in making placement recommendations and \notherwise  exercise  professional  judgment  in  a  manner  that  subjects  plaintiffs  to  harm  in  the  form  of  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization (undue restraint) and inadequate habilitation. Assuming the truth of those facts for purposes of a demurrer, \nplaintiffs state a cause of action under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.7 \n  \nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that defendants fail to exercise or act in accord with professional judgment by continuing \nto institutionalize people who are recommended by their planning teams for movement to community homes; and that \ndefendants make recommendations, not based on individual needs and choices, but based on the lack of a mandate from the \nDepartment of Developmental Services, inadequate individual program planning by regional center and institutional staff, \nand/or a lack of sufficient fiscal resources for the development of quality community living arrangements and ancillary \nsupports. E.g., Complaint, fflf 111,113f, 164-171, 258b, 258c. The complaint further alleges that defendants fail to conduct \nadequate assessments and fail to do individualized program planning in accord with standards established in State law - i.e., \nthe Lanterman Act - which, as discussed, courts have found to be a basis for findings that professional judgment has not been \nexercised. E.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 111,113d, 172-175. Plaintiffs further allege that defendants’ policies, procedures, and funding \npractices fail to make available a sufficient array of quality community living arrangements responsive to the individual \nneeds and choices of plaintiffs and class members, circumstances that cases have held frustrate and prevent decision-making \nbased on professional judgment. E.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 113e, 176-180. The complaint also alleges facts supporting the \ncontention that defendants fail to exercise professional judgment with respect to developmental center residents insofar as the \npersons most knowledgeable of community services frequently fail to attend individual program planning meetings. E.g., \nComplaint, ¶¶ 17, 173c, 173d, 258c. In addition, the complaint alleges that decisions are not made in accord with professional \njudgment insofar as recommendations against movement from developmental centers to the community are frequently based \nsolely on the objections of family members or conservators (in violation of the federal court injunction in Richard S. et al, v. \nBell et al.). Complaint, ¶258d. \n  \nPlaintiffs also allege, in accord with Youngberg, that defendants’ policies, practices, acts and omissions deprive plaintiffs of \ntheir fundamental liberty interests in violation of their substantive due process rights by exercising professional judgment in a \nmanner  that  denies  them  minimally  adequate  habilitation  and  subjects  them  to  undue  restraint  through  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization. E.g., Complaint ¶¶ 5, 111, 258a \n  \n8 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the complaint alleges, the named plaintiffs and an untold number of class members remain \nneedlessly institutionalized and, thus, unduly restrained, in violation of their liberty interests protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. E.g., Complaint ¶¶13, 17, 23, 27, 31, 35, 41, 47, 51-52, 58, 62, 68-69. \n  \nC. The Complaint Sufficiently States Causes of Action for Violation of Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Rights Under the \nCalifornia and United States Constitutions. \nSince the day the United States Supreme Court struck down the separate-but-equal doctrine of an earlier era, it has been well-\nsettled that segregation is a component of the discrimination prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), overruling Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). In \nCity of Clebume v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985), the Supreme court applied the principle to people with \ndevelopmental disabilities by ruling that a city could not exclude such persons from a community, barring them from \nestablishing a home there, in the absence of a legitimate state interest or rational explanation. Id.8 at 450. \n  \nUnder Cleburne, the very question posed in a case such as this, where segregation of persons with developmental disabilities \nis in issue, is whether there are indeed legitimate justifications for that segregation such that the state can show that the \nsegregation really does benefit those who are segregated. Citing Brown and Cleburne, the district court in Homeward Bound, \nInc. v. Hissom Memorial Center held that a state practice which segregates people with developmental disabilities from the \ncommunity runs afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if the segregation is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \n1987 WL 27104 at 19. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ federal and state equal protection causes of action are based on the contention that isolating people with \ndevelopmental disabilities in large institutions when their needs could be met in small-scale community living arrangements, \ncannot legitimately be justified as furthering the goal of providing care and habilitation. Plaintiffs have alleged that \ndefendants have violated their equal protection rights by unnecessarily and inappropriately segregating plaintiffs and class \nmembers in public and private institutions, and by establishing, encouraging and otherwise sanctioning programs, policies \nand practices that have excluded, separated and segregated people with developmental disabilities from society without any \nrational basis. Complaint, ¶¶ 254e, 260. State defendants will have an opportunity to establish that there are legitimate \njustifications for that segregation. Proof of these allegations, however, entails factual determinations which cannot be decided \nby demurrer. \n  \nD. The Complaint Sufficiently States Causes of Action for Violation of Plaintiffs’ Rights to Freedom of Expression \nand Association. \nState defendants challenge plaintiffs’ claims to freedom of expression and association under the First Amendment. In fact, \ncourts have found that institutionalization is associated with restrictions on institutionalized persons’ right to associate and \ninteract with members of the community. For example, the district court in Thomas S. found that: \nMembers  of  the  plaintiff  class  have  been  unnecessarily  congregated  and  segregated  together  in  large  institutions. \nConsequently, they are foreclosed from choosing their associates and from socializing with non-handicapped or non-\ninstitutionalized individuals. They are forced to associate almost exclusively with institutionalized, mentally disabled people \nand institutional staff. \n  \nBecause of the lack of services in the community, plaintiffs are essentially compelled to choose between the exercise of their \nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association and participation in a state program of care and habilitation. This pattern of \nsegregation and congregation prohibits free association and leads to further denial of free association because it is self-\nperpetuating. \n  \nThe plaintiffs’ right to freedom of association has been violated, as has their right to habilitation necessary to ensure that \nright. \n  \n  \n9 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \n699 F.Supp. at 1204; cf, Otmstead, 527 U.S. at 601 (holding that, under the ADA, unnecessary institutionalization is a form \nof discrimination on the basis of disability and noting Congress’ judgment that confinement in an institution severely \ndiminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic \nindependence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.). \n  \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the unnecessary segregation of plaintiffs and class members prevents them from living in the \ncommunity, and thereby unjustifiably restricts their ability to participate in community activities and associate with non-\ndisabled members of the community, including family and friends. By their Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action they have \nsufficiently alleged that such restrictions violate their constitutional rights to freedom of association and expression under the \nCalifornia and federal Constitutions. E.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 254d, 259. \n  \nIII. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A PROPER PARTY TO THIS ACTION. \nState defendants do not cite, and plaintiffs have not found, any authority immunizing the State of California from being \nnamed as a defendant in an action for declaratory and/or injunctive relief. Article 3, section 5 of the California Constitution \nprovides that suit may be brought against the State of California. Neither that provision nor any other authority of which \nplaintiffs are aware provides any limitation on the ability of a plaintiff to sue the State of California for injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief. \n  \nIndeed, in Butt v. State of California, 4 Cal.4th 668 (1992), the California Supreme Court affirmed a trial court’s decision to \nissue a preliminary injunction against the State of California in a case involving the inability of a school district to complete \nthe final weeks of a school term due to inadequate financial resources. The Supreme Court held that the trial court properly \nordered the State and its officials to protect the students’ rights because the State of California itself has a duty to provide \neducation. Id. at 704. \n  \nHere, too, it is the State of California itself that has assumed the responsibility to protect the rights of all alifomians with \ndevelopmental  disabilities.  The  Lanterman  Developmental  Disabilities  Services  Act  provides:  ‘  The  State  of \nCalifornia2006455924;0142;1993017236;RT;;; accepts a responsibility for persons with developmental disabilities and an \nobligation which it must discharge. Welf. & Inst. Code § 4501 (emphasis added); see also, Williams v. Macomber, 226 \nCal.App.3d 225, 232 (1990)2006455924;0103;1990179847;RP;;226;232; Ass ‘nfor Retarded Citizens-California v. Dept. of \nDevelopmental Services, 38 Cal.3d 384, 392 (1985)2006455924;0104;1985114764;RP;;233;392 ( [T]he [Lanterman] Act \ndefines a basic right and a corresponding basic obligation: the right which it grants to the developmentally disabled person is \nto be provided with services that enable him to live a more independent and productive life in the community; the obligation \nwhich it imposes on the state is to provide such services. (emphasis added)). As in Butt,2006455924;0143;1993017236;RT;;; \nit is proper to enjoin both the State of California and its agents in this case to ensure that the rights of Califomians with \ndevelopmental disabilities are upheld. \n  \nButt also puts the State defendants’ sole authority - State v. Superior Court, 12 Cal.3rd 237 (1974) - into context because the \ninjunction in Butt would have been reversed if there were a rule barring claims of injunctive and/or declaratory relief against \nthe State of California. State holds only that a demurrer was proper on the facts of that case. The plaintiffs in State sought \nreview of a decision by the Coastal Commission to reject an application for a building permit, hi a paragraph, the Court held \nthat the demurrer as to the State of California should have been sustained because (1) only the Coastal Commission and its \nmembers can set aside the Commission’s prior decision and (2) the complaint contained no allegations establishing any right \nto declaratory relief against the State of California. Id. at 255. Neither rationale has any application here. Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge a single decision of any state agency or commission. Rather, plaintiffs seek relief for the systemic violations of law \nperpetrated by the State of California and certain of its agents against individuals with developmental disabilities. Moreover, \nunlike in State, plaintiffs have alleged (in detail) the basis for their claims against the State of California and the other \ndefendants. \n  \nFinally, it is common practice for injunctive relief to run against the enjoined person and all persons or entities through whom \nthe enjoined person may act, such as its agents. Thus, plaintiffs name the State of California so that any relief they obtain will \nbind the State of California and each of its agents. For example, it would ensure that plaintiffs are protected if they obtain a \n10 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \njudgment that the state agency defendants claim insufficient resources or authority to satisfy. Thus, should the Court sustain \nthe demurrer on this point, plaintiffs may be forced to amend their complaint to name the Governor and other state officials to \nensure that plaintiffs obtain full and complete relief. \n  \nCONCLUSION \nA demurrer must be denied if a complaint or cause of action pleads any valid claim for relief. The facts alleged in the \ncomplaint here are sufficient to state claims under the Due Process Clauses of the California and federal Constitutions many \ntimes over. The complaint states more than sufficient facts concerning defendants’ failure to exercise professional judgment \nto establish violations of plaintiffs’ and class members’ substantive due process rights. State defendants have cited no case \nupholding a motion to dismiss or demurrer with respect to such claims. To the contrary, myriad cases have recognized valid \ndue process claims based on similar factual allegations. Similarly, plaintiffs state sufficient facts to establish claims for \nviolations of their constitutional rights to equal protection, freedom of association and expression. Finally, State defendants \ncite no applicable authority supporting their contention that the State is an improper party to these proceedings. \n  \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that State defendants’ demurrer be denied. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  Plaintiffs herein allege violations of plaintiffs’ substantive, not procedural, due process rights. Therefore, the cases State defendants \n  cite specifying factors for identifying whether procedural due process rights have been violated are inapposite. State Defs’ Brief at \n5-6. The relevant standard here is the one delineated by the United States Supreme Court in Youngberg. \n \n2  m subsequent opinions, the Supreme Court has further qualified that a professional’s judgment must be reasonable. E.g., School \n  Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 288 (1987); see also, Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n \n3  Clausingv. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 221 Cal.App.3d 1224,1238 (1990), cited by State defendants, wherein the court \n  held there was no affirmative duty to protect a citizen’s right to privacy, does not preclude the relief plaintiffs seek. State Defs’ \nBrief at 4. Any effective relief prohibiting or enjoining defendants from violating plaintiffs’ liberty interests through inappropriate \ninstitutionalization must, by necessity, include moving such individuals out of the institution. \n \n4  As the foregoing cases make clear, the protection from undue restraint referred to in Youngberg includes inappropriate \n  institutionalization itself, not merely bodily restraint in the institution as State defendants contend. State Defs’ Brief at 9. See also, \nIn re Roger S., 19 Cal.3d at 929 (holding that involuntary confinement is a direct form of physical restraint and that freedom from \nbodily restraint is a principal ingredient of personal liberty). \n \n5  Although they purport to attack plaintiffs’ due process claim for failure to state a cause of action, in fact, State defendants really \n  attack plaintiffs’ remedy and not their well-pleaded claims which, in this instance, arise under the State and federal Constitutions. \nE.g., State Defs’ Brief at 3-4. The relief that State defendants refer to, however, is based not only on plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims, but also on claims arising under, inter alia, the Lanterman Act, which does in fact impose a mandatory duty to provide \nresidential services and supports in the least restrictive setting. If, after trial or on summary judgment, the Court finds that \ndefendants have violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights as pleaded in the complaint, the Court will then have the duty to formulate \na remedy to correct the violations. Thus, defendants’ motion falls outside the confines of a demurrer, which is limited to claims, \nnot relief. See, e.g., Venice Town Council v. City of Los Angeles, 47 Cal.App.4th at 1561-62. \n \n6  This, of course, begs the factual question, particularly with respect to developmental center residents, as to whether any residents \n  are admitted voluntarily. Strict due process requirements mandate judicial commitment orders for virtually all persons placed in a \ndevelopmental center. See, e.g., In re Hop. Moreover, with respect to any institutional setting, the voluntariness of any choice is \nillusory when, as alleged by this action, appropriate alternatives are not offered or available. \n \n7  Because the California Constitution must meet minimal federal due process standards, plaintiffs also state a viable substantive due \n  process claim based on infringement of the fundamental liberty interest protected by the California Constitution, Article 1, §§ 1 \nand 7. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418,430-31 (1979) (states may adopt different due process standards and procedures, \nso long as they meet the constitutional minimum), In fact, the due process liberty interest under the California Constitution has \nbeen construed to be broader than under the federal Constitution. See, e.g., People v. Ramirez, 25 Cal.3d 260, 265-68 (1979). \n \n11 \n \n\nCapitol PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Petitioners/Plaintiffs, v...., 2002 WL 32820044...   \n \n \n8  While refusing to decide whether they fall into a suspect or quasi-suspect class, the Supreme Court nonetheless recognized that \n  policies that exclude persons with mental retardation may be impermissibly based on prejudice and fear. 473 U.S. at 438, 443-46. \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n12 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n  \nIt is difficult to imagine a claim less suited to class action treatment than this litigation. The proposed class of persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities experience an incredible diversity of disabilities, medical conditions, living conditions and needs. \nCalifornia’s system for persons with developmental disabilities works from the bottom up with services designed for each \nclass member by a team of specialists familiar with their unique needs. Plaintiffs do not challenge clearly defined policies or \npractices which apply uniformly - or even at all - to each proposed class member. Rather, plaintiffs’ unfocused allegations \ncontend generally that defendants’ practices, as carried out in thousands of individual cases, result in overly restrictive \nresidential placements. \n  \nThis case was filed in January 2002 by persons with developmental disabilities and advocacy organizations contending that \ndefendants are violating state and federal anti-discrimination statutes, various constitutional provisions, the state statute \nwhich defines the system of services for persons *2 with developmental disabilities and the federal Medicaid Act. Plaintiffs \nallege that they and other persons with developmental disabilities are unnecessarily institutionalized due to defendants’ \nfailure to conduct adequate assessments and to provide sufficient and timely services in the community. Defendants deny \neach of the plaintiffs’ allegations and vigorously contest that any of the thousands of case-specific decisions regarding any of \nthe class members have resulted in improper institutionalization. \n  \nThe persons affected by defendants’ system of services did not speak with a single voice to the trial court. Ten individuals \nand two organizations of family members, conservators and friends of persons with developmental disabilities intervened in \nthe action to contest the plaintiffs’ position. The intervenors disputed plaintiffs’ view that the “system was broken” and \nvehemently disagreed with the remedies plaintiffs proposed. \n  \nSome four years after the original complaint was filed, plaintiffs moved for class certification. The trial court judge, before \nwhom the case was pending throughout that period, carefully considered the evidence and concluded that the claims raised by \n5 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nthe plaintiffs could not be tried on a class wide basis. The court found that common questions did not predominate over \nindividual ones, that the plaintiffs were not adequate representatives of the putative class and that class members had other \nmechanisms to challenge defendants’ actions, as set forth fully below. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief fails to meet these objections. Indeed, plaintiffs ignore most of the ruling below and misread the \nremainder. Their arguments fail to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. \n  \n*3 II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA. Introduction \nThe trial court’s ruling on the motion for class certification arises in a factual setting unlike any other. Persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities defy easy categorization, especially with regard to the issues raised in this litigation. The system of \nservices designed for them is unique and is as complex and diverse as the population it serves. The trial court concluded that \nthe legal and factual issues raised in plaintiffs’ complaint could not be resolved in the context of a class action lawsuit. To \nunderstand this ruling, it is necessary to review the evidence in the record regarding developmental disabilities and the \nsystem administered by the defendants. \n  \nB. The Lanterman Act System Of Services For Persons With Developmental Disabilities \nIn California, the Lanterman Act (the “Act”) defines the roles of the agencies responsible for persons with developmental \ndisabilities and the mechanisms for delivering services appropriate to each individual’s needs. (Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 4500 \net. seq.)1 The administrative structure is highly decentralized with responsibility for most decisions placed in the hands of \nlocal, non-profit agencies. Because of the wide diversity in population served, the system is built around an individualized \nassessment of each consumer. \n  \nThe Department of Developmental Services (DDS) is the state agency with direct jurisdiction over the operation of \nLanterman Act services. DDS directly provides services in five state-operated developmental centers (DCs) and two \ncommunity- based facilities to approximately 3,100 of the state’s more  *4 than 200,000 persons with developmental \ndisabilities - identified in the Act as “consumers.” (§§ 4512 (d), 4629.). Pursuant to the Act, DDS contracts with 21 \nnon-profit agencies which operate regional centers (RCs) to render services to the vast majority of consumers.2 Under the \nAct, DDS’s role “is basically limited to promoting the cost-effectiveness of the operations of the RCs, and does not extend to \nthe control of the manner in which they provide services or in general operate their programs.” ( Association for Retarded \nCitizens v. Department of Developmental Services (1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 389 - 90.) \n  \nEach RC has a separate management structure and governing board. (§ 4622.) Each RC acts as “a single point of contact” for \nall consumers in a given geographic area. In this capacity, the RCs have comprehensive responsibility to the consumers in \ntheir catchment area; they determine eligibility, assess needs, and coordinate the delivery of services. (§§ 4620, 4643, \n4646-4648.) All consumers, even those who reside in state-owned facilities, are assigned an individual case manager by the \nRC. (§ 4640.6; see also, e.g., 3JS0553, 3JS0710, 3JS0717, 3JS0740.) In most cases, consumers receive services from private \nvendors pursuant to contracts with the RCs. DDS has authorized over 150 different services which RCs may purchase on \nbehalf of consumers from residential care, to transportation, to recreation. ( Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 17 § 54342.) \n  \nC. The Population Served \nRCs serve a population of incredible diversity. The term “developmental disability” is a very broad one; it refers to a severe \nand chronic disability that is *5 attributable to a mental or physical impairment that begins before an individual reaches \n6 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nadulthood. The qualifying disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions \nclosely related to mental retardation or requiring similar treatment. (§ 4512(a).) \n  \nThe persons served by defendants suffer from a wide variety of disabilities. (2JS0359.) Nearly a third suffer from a \ncombination of two or more disabilities. (2JS0359.) The level of retardation statewide among consumers ranges from none or \nunknown to profound. (2JS0359.) Many face significant challenges such as problems with vision, hearing and ambulation. \nApproximately 10% are dually diagnosed with both a developmental disability and a mental health condition. (2JS0360.) \n  \nBecause the term “developmental disability” includes such a broad spectrum of conditions, the persons served by defendants \nexhibit very different abilities for independent living. The proposed class includes persons who need minimal supervision and \ntravel freely on public transportation. (2JS0360, 2JS0382.) It also incorporates persons who are nonverbal and require care in \nnursing  facilities  for  very  severe  medical  conditions.  (2JS0361,  2JS0374.)  Some  disabilities  cause  threatening  or \nself-injurious behaviors severe enough to endanger the person’s life. (3JS0687, 3JS0695.) No two consumers exhibit the \nsame strengths and weaknesses or require the same services. \n  \nD. The Assessment Process \nBecause of the highly complex and variable nature of the consumers’ disabilities, California, pursuant to the Lanterman Act, \nassesses the needs of each consumer on an individual basis. The core of the system is the Individual Program Plan (IPP). The \nIPP must be prepared and reviewed and, if necessary, modified at least every three years, and must include an *6 assessment \nof the consumer’s capabilities and problems; a statement of time-limited objectives for improving his or her situation; a \nschedule of the type and amount of services necessary to achieve these objectives; and a schedule of periodic review to insure \nthat the services have been provided and the objectives have been reached. (§ 4646.) \n  \nEach IPP is the product of an interdisciplinary team specifically constituted for each consumer. The team consists of the \nconsumer, his/her family, conservator, and/or guardian, the RC service coordinator and any other person that the consumer or \nthe family wishes to have as a member of the team. As the name implies, the interdisciplinary team includes appropriate \nprofessionals who are familiar with the consumer. (§ 4512(j).) The make up and membership of the planning team will \nobviously differ from consumer to consumer. \n  \nThe IPP is developed “through a process of individualized needs determination.” (§ 4646(b).) DDS’s Individual Program \nPlan Resource Manual (“IPP Manual”) directs planning teams to use “person-centered” planning methods and encourages \nteams to determine consumer choices even for those who can articulate choices only with difficulty. (2JS0361-362.) The IPP \nManual requires teams to “consider whether there are any current or potential health and safety risks to the individual that \nwould affect their desired life and living arrangement.” (Ibid.) Team members must balance “freedom of choice and the \nsafety and health of the individual” and “personal liberty and the expectations of society to conform to social norms.” (Ibid.) \nThe balance achieved will be “different for each individual.” (Ibid.) \n  \nFor persons living outside of a DC, RCs have the responsibility to conduct the IPP planning process. (Ibid.) DDS does not \nhave the power *7 to substitute its judgment for that of the RC as to decisions made in any IPP. ( Association for Retarded \nCitizens v. DDS, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 390.) For persons living in DCs, the IPP planning team will typically include \nprofessionals  who  are  state  employees  such  as  physicians,  psychologists,  social  workers,  therapists,  and  psychiatric \ntechnicians. (See, e.g., 2JS0430, 3JS0585.) \n  \nE. Types of Residential Settings \nConsumers live in a wide variety of residential settings, most commonly in their own or their parents’ home or in small group \nsettings. (JA2350-1; see also  Sanchez v. Johnson (9th Cir. 2005)416 F.3d 1051, 1065-1066.) The class proposed by the \nplaintiffs  consisted  of  all  persons  living  in  settings  which  plaintiffs  designated  as  “institutions.”  The  only  common \ncharacteristic is that they have a capacity of 16 or more. (4JA1086.) Therefore, they include a wide range of disparate \n7 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nsettings. (6JA1548-1550.) The remaining facilities are privately owned and include skilled nursing facilities, community care \nfacilities, and psychiatric treatment centers. (2JS0388-0394.) The level and types of care vary from non-medical supervision \n(community care facilities) to intensive skilled nursing (sub-acute) to locked facilities for the care of seriously emotionally \ndisturbed children (community treatment facilities). (Ibid.) \n  \nF. The Community Placement Plan and Deinstitutionalization \nThe Lanterman Act has created a Community Placement Plan (CPP) designed to move consumers from DCs to the \ncommunity. (§ 4418.25; 9JA2402.) Under the CPP, RCs identify consumers they intend to move into the community and \ndevelop budgets to carry out the transition. (9JA2403.) There is no limit on the number of persons that a RC can place on its \nCPP budget. (9JA2272.) Since its inception in fiscal year 2001/2, the CPP has pumped $150 million new funding into the \nprocess of deinstitutionalization; *8 this year’s CPP budget is $73,800,000. (9JA2403-2404.) DDS expends as much as \n$275,000 per consumer per year to provide services and supports in the community. (9JA2403.) \n  \nNew resources for persons with developmental disabilities are constantly being developed through the efforts of RCs. \n(2JS0364.) RCs receive funding for staff to identify services that are needed and to encourage the creation of new programs \nand to develop new vendors. (See, e.g., 9JA2295-2306.) \n  \nAt the time of the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class, the most recent statistics showed that defendants provided \nservices  to  204,777  consumers.  (9JA2381.)  Despite  unprecedented  growth  in  caseload,  the  system  of  services  has \nstrengthened its ability to serve persons in community settings. In the fiscal year during which the motion was heard, the state \nbudgeted $2.9 billion to serve consumers in the community, nearly 80% of whom live in their own home. (2JS0364-5.) In the \n12 years preceding the motion, the percentage of consumers living in “institutions” as defined by plaintiffs underwent a \nsteady decline from nearly 11% to under 4%. (2JS0365, 9JA2339-40, 9JA2381-7.) \n  \nTABLE \nTABULAR OR GRAPHIC MATERIAL SET FORTH AT THIS POINT IS NOT DISPLAYABLE \n*9 Looking at California’s efforts to serve persons with developmental disabilities in the least restrictive environment, the \nNinth Circuit found California’s efforts at deinstitutionalization to be “genuine, comprehensive and reasonable.” ( Sanchez \nv. Johnson, supra, 416 F.3d at 1067.) \n  \nG. Administrative Remedies to Challenge Institutional Status \nThe overwhelming majority of consumers in DCs were placed there as the result of an order of a Superior Court, typically \npursuant to sections 6500 et. seq. or  In re Hop (1983) 29 Cal.3d 82.(9JA2341, 9JA2263-2264.) Therefore, these \nconsumers are already subject to the jurisdiction of a superior court. Moreover, consumers, their conservators or their \nauthorized representatives may bring a request for fair hearing to challenge any aspect of the his/her assessment and services \nas reflected in his/her IPP, including institutionalization. (Welf. & Inst. Code § § 4700 et seq.) Persons in DCs may also seek \ndeinstitutionalization by writ of habeas corpus. (9JA2264.) \n  \nH. Claims Raised In Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleges generally that “thousands” of persons with developmental disabilities are “needlessly isolated \nand segregated” in “public and private institutions.” (4JA0942) The complaint alleges failures on the part of all 21 RCs and \nnumerous state agencies in all aspects of their operations. Plaintiffs contend that defendants fail to conduct adequate \nassessments and do not “develop sufficient quality programs.” (4JA0943) The complaint uses similarly expansive language \n8 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nin describing the manner in which defendants have allegedly violated state and federal law including Lanterman Act, ADA, \nsection 504, Government section 11135, various constitutional provisions, Medicaid Act, and a taxpayer action. \n  \n*10 I. Motion for Intervention \nOn November 20, 2002, 10 DC residents who wished to remain in institutions and two organizations representing parents, \nconservators and friends of DC residents filed a motion to intervene. (1JA0077-145.) Intervenors vehemently disagreed that \nplaintiffs were adequate representatives for the class, and argued that the relief sought by plaintiffs would impair the \nfundamental rights of those persons whose needs are best met in an institution. (1JA0087.) \n  \nPlaintiffs opposed the motion for intervention contending in part that family members and conservators do not have “a legally \ncognizable interest” in opposing institutional residents’ constitutional and “statutory rights to receive services in integrated \nsettings when their needs can be appropriately met outside the confines of a state institution.” (1JA0267.) Therefore, they \ncontended that intervenors’ interests “are potentially and actually in conflict” with the interests of plaintiffs and the putative \nclass. (1JA0265.) On January 28, 2003, the court granted the motion to intervene. \n  \nJ. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \nPlaintiffs filed their motion for class certification that is the subject of this appeal on September 29, 2005. Plaintiffs argued \nthat their complaint addresses “policies and practices [that] affect every member of the plaintiff class.” (1JS0007.) However, \nplaintiffs’ motion is not consistent in its description of the policies and practices at issue. Plaintiffs listed the alleged common \npolicies, procedures and policies in an attachment to their motion. (Ibid.) The list covers 13 items in nearly two pages of \nsingle-spaced type. (1JS0035-36.) Many items, such as “failing to engage in ... interagency coordination,” allocating “a \ndisproportionate amount of resources on *11 institutional services in relation to community services,” and interference by \nother  state  defendants  in  the  efforts  by  DDS  and  RCs  to  “fulfill  their  responsibilities  to  prevent  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization,” are not discussed at all in the remainder of the memorandum. (Ibid.) Elsewhere, plaintiffs describe 11 \n“deficiencies in defendants’ systems-planning and resource development efforts” which they could establish by “common \nproof.” (1JS0013-14.) Some of the 11 deficiencies, such as failing to keep “waiting lists” and failing to “systematically \ncollect data on gaps in the array of available services” are not included in the attachment. (Ibid.) At one point, plaintiffs state \nthat there are six “factual and legal issues common to the class” and at another they list five different ways in which the class \nmembers have suffered “deprivations typical of those experienced by the entire class.” (1JS0023-24, 1JS0027.) While there is \nsome overlap, none of the lists use the same definitions or include the same factual or legal issues. The simplest description \ngiven by the plaintiffs describes two “pervasive practices” of: \n1) failing to adequately assess for and identify the services and supports that would enable class members to live in more \nintegrated non-institutional settings; and \n  \n2) failing to develop and/or provide sufficient community-based services and supports and living options to enable class \nmembers who do not need to be institutionalized to live in the most integrated settings appropriate. \n  \n  \n(1JS0025.) \n  \nPlaintiffs’ motion was accompanied by deposition testimony of state and RC staff regarding their personal opinions and/or \nexperience and declarations of class members or their guardians ad litem each describing in detail their complaints against a \nparticular RC or DC. (1JS0123-238.) In addition, plaintiffs provided excerpts of depositions of 14 individuals including *12 \nemployees of DDS, various RCs and client advocates. (1JS0276, 5JA 1107-1339) The testimony included opinions and \nconclusions based on the deponents’ experiences. Finally, plaintiffs submitted some documentary evidence such as data from \nDDS on population, consumer characteristics and spending, a plan for the closure of a DC, and an article on funding levels \nsponsored by the California Alliance for Inclusive Communities, one of plaintiffs. (5JA1102-1355, 6JA1356-1466.) \n  \n9 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nK. Defendants’ and Intervenors’ Opposition \nState defendants’ opposition argued that the claims of named plaintiffs were not typical of the class; indeed, that the class \nmembers did not share typicality with each other as to the claims raised in the complaint. (2JS0370-375.) In addition, \ndefendants argued that the claims made by plaintiffs were not subject to common proof. (2JS0375-384.) The opposition \nincluded declarations from RC and DC staff familiar with each of plaintiffs which contradicted the version of facts provided \nby  plaintiffs.  (2JS0560-563,  2JS0524-573,  3JS0574-65??,3JS0685-745.)  Attachment  B  to  state  defendants’  opposition \nsummarized the factual controversies between the parties to demonstrate the wide spectrum of highly individualized disputes \nin the record. (2JS0395-424.) State defendants submitted a declaration from an expert in developmental disabilities who \nstated that the propriety of institutionalization was not subject to group analysis; “it is not possible to resolve [the] issue \nraised  by  plaintiffs-whether  inadequate  assessments  and  insufficient  community  resources  lead  to  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization - without considering the facts of each consumer’s case.” (3JS0684) \n  \nSeventeen RCs filed a joint opposition. (8JA 1963-1988.) Emphasizing the tremendous diversity among class members, the \nRCs argued that the *13 plaintiffs’ theories could not be resolved in a class action. (Ibid.) Because the decisions at issue were \ndecided on an individualized basis, these RCs argued that existing administrative and judicial remedies were superior. \n(8JA1975-1976.) The RCs also filed declarations from RC staff regarding numerous representative consumers who lived in a \nvariety  of  institutional  settings,  and  exhibited  a  wide  variety  of  conditions  and  abilities  for  independent  living. \n(2JS0280-351.) The reasons for their institutionalization and the restrictiveness of their residential settings differed widely. \n  \nIntervenors opposed the motion for class certification on the ground that plaintiffs could not adequately represent the class \nand that there was no community of interest among the class members. (8JA 1989-2001.) They filed declarations from \npersons regarding family members who had lived both in community settings and in DCs. Each declared that their relatives \nhad experienced a better quality of life in DCs. (8JA2030-2031, 8JA2058-2059, 8JA2064, 8JA2069) They believed that DC \noffered greater opportunities for consumers to have contact with the community than in small group homes, and that DCs \nconstituted the “least restrictive environment” for their family members. (8JA2031, 8JA2055, 8JA2080-2081) \n  \nL. Plaintiffs’ Reply \nPlaintiffs contested the facts related by state defendants as to each of the class members, and submitted their own table in \nresponse to Attachment B to state defendants’ opposition, which purported to describe “defendants’ errors” as to each named \nplaintiff.  (10JA2652-2661.)  Plaintiffs’  table  also  included  summaries  of  evidence  as  to  individual  class  members  to \ndemonstrate  “their  commonality  and  typicality.”  (10JA2643,  10JA2662-2679.)  The  table  summarized  evidence  under \nheadings that paraphrased some, but not all, *14 of plaintiffs’ contentions of allegedly common illegal practices. Each \ncontention was supported by evidence relating to a different set of class members. No one contention applied to all class \nmembers. (Ibid.) Each summary of evidence relied on factual allegations regarding the individual class members which were \ndisputed by defendants.3 \n  \nIn response to intervenors’ opposition, plaintiffs stated in part that intervenors’ brief “expresses a pro-institutionalization \nideology which is irrelevant to the resolution of Plaintiffs’ motion or any other issue in this case.” (10JA2690.) \n  \nM. The Order Denying Class Certification \nOn January 30, 2005, the trial court issued its order denying the motion for class certification. It first considered the impact of \nthe fact that plaintiffs were seeking systemwide injunctive relief on its legal analysis. The court stated that the commonality \nanalysis would be “focused more on the actions of the defendant than on whether those actions have a common effect on each \nof the Plaintiffs.” (14JA3608.) Nor would the court have to address variations in individual injunctive relief. (Ibid.) However, \nbecause absent class members would not be allowed to opt out, the court would “pay closer attention to the *15 adequacy \nanalysis” and “think more carefully about whether class wide injunctive relief is the best means to address and remedy the \nalleged wrongdoing.” (14JA3609.) \n  \n10 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nCiting  Hicks v. Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 908, 916 and 917-918, the court stated that class \ncertification is determined “with reference to the claims asserted ....” (Ibid.) The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that \ncertification be determined by a “super-claim” approach as adopted by the trial court in  Marisol A. By Forbes v. Giulani \n(2nd Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d 372. (14JA3609-3610.) The court also refused to follow the approach argued by defendants that the \ncourt analyze each legal theory raised in the complaint separately even though this approach “is more consistent with \nCalifornia law.” (14JA3610.) Instead, the court concluded it was more appropriate to focus on “the alleged wrongs than on \nthe discrete legal theories alleged.” (Ibid.) \n  \nThe court found that “the discrete alleged wrongs at the center of Plaintiffs’ claims concern primarily the development of \nIPPs.” (Ibid.) The court identified the five central alleged wrongs as: 1) failure to provide understandable information in the \nIPP process; 2) inadequate assessments in the IPP process; 3) not basing IPP recommendations on the needs and choices of \nthe disabled persons; 4) failure to provide timely services and supports as suggested by IPPs; and 5) failure to develop \nadequate community resources. (14JA3610-3611.) The court noted that both plaintiffs and defendants focused their analysis \non these categories of issues. (Ibid.) \n  \nThe court examined the issue of commonality under two different approaches. First, in what it described as the “standard \napproach,” the court determined that plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating that *16 common issues of law and \nfact predominated, citing  Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, 1108. (14JA3611.) \n  \nThe court also analyzed the requirement of commonality under the  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) test, which \nthe court described as an “alternate approach.” (14JA3614.) The court found there was evidence that “Defendants had \npolicies that were common and affected each member of the putative class.” (Ibid.) However, even under the federal test, the \ncourt concluded that class certification would be improper. “The trier of fact cannot avoid the reality that each IPP is \nindividualized in its development, content, and implementation, and this would restrict the use of sampling or statistical proof \nat trial.” (14JA3619.) \n  \nThe court concluded that plaintiffs did not satisfy the requirement that they be adequate representatives of the class because \nof the significant conflict between plaintiffs and intervenors. (14JA3615-3617.) The court considered the fact that absent \nclass members could not opt out and that the systemic changes plaintiffs sought in defendants’ policies would affect all \npersons in the system. As a result, the court concluded that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they were adequate \nrepresentatives of the class or that the interests of intervenors would be adequately protected if the class were certified. (Ibid.) \n  \nFinally, the court determined that the wrongs alleged by plaintiffs “cannot be readily cured on a class wide basis.” (Ibid.) The \ncourt also found that the fair hearing procedure under § § 4701-4716 was an effective means for individuals to seek relief. \n(14JA3618-3619.) \n  \n*17 III. ARGUMENT \nA. Standard of Review in the Court of Appeal \nThis court is limited to determining whether the superior court abused its discretion in denying class certification; “[a]ny \nvalid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.” ( Caro v. Proctor & Gamble Co. (1993) 18 \nCal.App.4th 644, 655-656.)4 Generally, the court of appeal will “not disturb a trial court ruling on class certification which is \nsupported by substantial evidence unless (1) improper criteria were used ...; or (2) erroneous legal assumptions were made ...” \n( Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470, citations omitted.) “Because trial courts are ideally situated \nto evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action, they are afforded great discretion in granting or \ndenying certification.” ( Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435.) \n  \n11 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nB. The Requirements for Class Certification \nSection 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizes class suits when “the question is one of a common or general interest, \nof many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.” In order to \nmaintain a class action, there must exist “ascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest among the class \nmembers. The community of interest requirement embodies three factors: (1) predominant common questions of law or fact; \n(2) class representatives with claims or *18 defenses typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately \nrepresent the class.” ( Richmond, supra, 29 Cal.3d at 470, citations omitted.) C. The Trial Court Correctly Found That \nPlaintiffs Had Failed to Meet Their Burden of Establishing Commonality The trial court properly found that common issues \nof law and fact did not predominate and that plaintiffs could not adequately represent the class, and that an alternative \nprocedure exits to address plaintiffs’ claims. \n  \n1. The legal standard \nPlaintiffs’ brief on appeal is remarkable in what it fails to address. While plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s ruling that their \nclaims lack commonality, no where do they discuss the standard under California law. Plaintiffs’ brief seems to proceed on \nthe mistaken assumption that all they must do is merely allege that the class shares common claims in order to meet this \nrequirement. However, California law requires that courts examine the evidence that will actually be heard on plaintiffs’ \nclaims to determine whether the common questions predominate. \n  \nThe proponent of class certification bears the burden of showing “that questions of law or fact common to the class \npredominate over the questions affecting the individual members.” ( Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court (2001) 24 \nCal.4th 906, 913.) Therefore, plaintiffs were required to demonstrate to the trial court “that the questions which they will be \nrequired to litigate separately are not numerous or substantial ....” ( Osborne v. Subaru of America, Inc. (1988) 198 \nCal.App.3d 646, 653-654, citations omitted.) Certification is properly denied where “the individual questions to be decided \nmay prove too complex, numerous and substantial to allow the class action... or the benefits to be gained may not be \nsignificant enough to justify imposition *19 of a judgment binding on absent parties.” (Ibid.) Furthermore, a class action \n“will not be permitted... where there are diverse factual issues to be resolved, even though there may be many common \nquestions of law.” (Ibid.) \n  \nIn order to accurately measure whether there is predominance, the court must necessarily consider the elements of plaintiffs’ \nclaims. “In order to determine whether common questions of fact predominate the trial court must examine the issues framed \nby the pleadings and the law applicable to the causes of action alleged.” ( Hicks, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at 916,footnotes \nomitted.) The focus of the court’s analysis “is on what type of questions - common or individual - are likely to arise in the \naction,” and whether “the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is, as an analytical matter, likely to \nprove amenable to class treatment.” ( Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 327.) \n  \nUltimately, the question faced by the court is a practical one. The court must determine “whether ... the issues which may be \njointly tried, when compared with those requiring separate adjudication, are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance \nof a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.” (Id. at 326.) \n  \nAs a result, the court must scrutinize the record to determine whether commonality exists. As the supreme court has \nemphasized, the moving party’s burden “is not merely to show that some common issues exist, but rather, to place substantial \nevidence in the record that common questions predominate.” ( Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 29 \nCal.4th 1096, 1104, citations omitted, italics original.) In Lockheed, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in the form of medical \nmonitoring for a class of residents who had been exposed to toxins from drinking water contaminated by defendants’ *20 \nmanufacturing plant. The court concluded that plaintiffs could demonstrate through common proof that defendants owed a \nduty to plaintiffs and that defendants had acted negligently in disposing of toxic chemicals. (Id. at 1108-9.) However, the \nLockheed plaintiffs’ claims required them to show that “the need for future monitoring is a reasonably certain consequence of \n[the] toxic exposure.” (Id. at 1109.) On this point, the court concluded that “plaintiffs have not placed in the record sufficient \n12 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nevidence to warrant the trial court’s concluding that they are likely to be able to make that demonstration with common \nproof.” (Ibid.) \n  \nIn contrast, the supreme court affirmed a trial court’s order certifying a class in Sav-On. As in Lockheed, the court’s \nconclusion was based on its examination of the evidentiary record: \nPresuming in favor of the certification order, as we must, the existence of every fact the trial court could \nreasonably deduce from the record we cannot say it would be irrational for a court to conclude that, tried \non plaintiffs’ theory, questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions \naffecting the individual members. \n  \n  \n( 34 Cal.4th at 329,internal quotations and citations omitted.) The court specifically noted that it was not necessary to \n“conclude that plaintiffs’ evidence is compelling, or even that the trial court would have abused its discretion if it had \ncredited defendant’s evidence instead.” (Id. at 331.) Nor was it relevant whether “the trial court believing other evidence, or \ndrawing other reasonable inferences, might have reached a contrary conclusion.” (Ibid., internal quotation omitted.) \n  \nThus, the appellate court’s role on this question is to determine “whether the record contains substantial evidence to support \nthe trial court’s predominance finding ....” ( Lockheed, supra, 29 Cal.4th at 1106.) The trial *21 court’s analysis of the \nrecord is entitled to deference; “where a certification order turns on inferences to be drawn from the facts, reviewing court \nhas no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial  court.” (Sav-On, 34 Cal.4th at 328, citation omitted.) \n  \n2. The trial court’s conclusion that the issues raised in plaintiffs claims are not subject to common proof is supported \nby the record \nAmong the most egregious of the misstatements in plaintiffs brief is the contention that the trial court “did not analyze any of \nPlaintiffs’ legal claims or specify why any particular claim lacked commonality.” (AOB at 33.) In fact, the trial court \nanalyzed the evidence as to each of plaintiffs’ claims and explained why individual questions overwhelmed the common \nquestions. (14JA3612-36144.) Plaintiffs’ brief largely ignores this portion of the order, which the trial court labeled “the \nstandard approach” and the “soundest basis for decision.” (14JA3619.) Significantly, plaintiffs’ opening brief does not even \nattempt to argue that the trial court lacked substantial evidence for concluding that common issues did not predominate.5 Also \nincorrect is the statement by plaintiffs that the trial court erroneously concluded that “systemic violations were insufficient to \nestablish commonality.” (AOB at 36.) The trial court did not announce a rule against class action treatment of allegations of \nunlawfulness in the administration of programs for persons with developmental disabilities. Instead, the trial court concluded \nthat the issues raised by plaintiffs in this litigation did not meet the requirement of commonality. A review of the record \nbefore the trial court amply supports *22 this conclusion. As demonstrated in the following sections, the trial court’s \nconclusion that common questions do not predominate as to each claim raised by the plaintiffs is supported by the record.6 \n  \na. Plaintiffs’ claim that defendants fail to provide understandable information \nGiven the innumerable individual factors that affect this aspect of plaintiffs’ claims, it is no wonder that the court found no \ncommonality. Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding “inadequate” information are not limited to any one representation or class of \nrepresentations. The evidence demonstrated that class members receive information throughout their lives from a variety of \nofficial sources from state employees at developmental centers, RC case managers, independent advocates and social \nworkers. (9JA2408-2409.) Both DDS and individual RCs provide written and web-based information for consumers \nregarding their rights and options under the system of services. (Ibid.) Furthermore, the information and the manner in which \nit will be provided depends on circumstances unique to the consumer. In answers to interrogatories, plaintiffs acknowledged \n13 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nthat the type of information that needs to be provided “will obviously vary depending on the consumer.” (9JA2248-2257.) A \ncourt examining plaintiffs’ claim on this issue could not apply the same standard in each case; the ability of consumers to \nunderstand and their experiences vary widely. Some class members are profoundly retarded and non-verbal while others \nsuffer from mild retardation and are highly verbal. (2JS371, 395-397.) Nor can plaintiffs’ allegations be tested by reviewing \nrecords. Plaintiffs’ expert, Lyn Rucker, testified that *23 in order to determine whether the defendants had provided adequate \ninformation it would be necessary to conduct interviews of the consumer, staff, and family asking “what information was \nprovided to you and what did you really want to know.” (9JA2279.) \n  \nWhile plaintiffs’ opening brief contends that their claims are all about “systemic” issues, their “common evidence” of \n“common  practices  and  polices”  allegedly  resulting  in  class  members  receiving  inadequate  information  is  highly \ncase-specific. (AOB at 43-44.) Plaintiffs do not-and cannot-contend that DDS has adopted policies that prohibit, restrict or \nimpair the free flow of information. The DDS IPP Manual directs all publically funded agencies to “provide relevant \ninformation in an understandable form” to consumers and their families including “visual and experiential information” such \nas visits to different types of living arrangements and job prospects. (2JS371-372.) The only evidence cited by plaintiffs in \nthe AOB in support of their theory that there is a common policy is the testimony of a Clients’ Rights Advocate at one \ndevelopmental center. She stated that in some cases information is provided in a “very understandable form”; in other cases it \nis not. (6JA1586.) In their motion to the trial court, plaintiffs cited declarations regarding instances in which plaintiffs alleged \nthat individual consumers had failed to receive adequate information about services. (10JA2662-2664.) The complaints share \nlittle in common. In five cases, plaintiffs allege the consumers did not receive “experiential” information regarding the \nservices and supports in the community. (10JA2662.) In another five instances, plaintiffs believe the consumers should have \nreceived information about specific services such as  “supported living” or “Bates homes.” (10JA2663-2664.) In the \nremaining six cases, the plaintiffs state generally that consumers were not given information *24 on services and supports \nthat would address their needs. (10JA2662-2664.) However, plaintiffs do not describe what information should be given or in \nwhat form. \n  \nFurthermore, defendants submitted declarations of developmental and RC staff that countered the testimony submitted by \nplaintiffs. A few examples are sufficient to demonstrate the facts of each case were hotly contested. For instance, plaintiffs \nclaim that one consumer lived for “four years in institutions without being provided information on what community supports \nand services would address [her] needs.” (10JA2662.) Defendants submitted the declaration of the consumer’s case manager \nwho stated that the consumer suffers from cerebral palsy, but is not cognitively impaired and has participated in numerous \nmeetings with medical providers and other agencies to discuss her living arrangements. (8JA1958.) Plaintiffs cite the \ntestimony of the mother of another consumer who claimed she did not receive information about services that would have \npermitted her daughter to come home from a sub-acute medical facility. (10JA2663.) Defendants’ declaration states that the \nconsumer’s physician repeatedly told the consumer’s parents that she could not be moved to a lower level of care because of \nher fragile and unstable medical condition including the need for a ventilator. (3JS707.) When the consumer’s condition \nstabilized and she was weaned from the ventilator, the RC arranged for the consumer to be moved to live with her parents. \n(3JS707-708.) Plaintiffs contend that a third consumer did not receive “basic information about what community resources, \nsupport groups and agencies were available to assist him with community living.” (10JA2663.) Defendants counter that the \nconsumer had sufficient information to make his own decisions about community placement. His team felt that he should be \nplaced in a group *25 home; however, he stated a strong preference for living in his own apartment. (2JS0562.) The RC \ncontracted with a private agency that located housing and provided supports to permit him to live in his own home. (Ibid.) \n  \nThus, an examination of the evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that this claim cannot be established through \ncommon proof. The trial court correctly determined that “[t]he evidence suggests that the IPPs are individualized and that \nmuch of the information [about community placements] is conveyed orally.” (14JA3613.) The court properly noted that the \nevidence is entirely different from that in  Vasquez v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 811-813. There, defendant’s \nsalesmen delivered a memorized, standard sales pitch based on a printed narrative and sales manual. This was sufficient to \ngive rise to a common issue of whether the defendants had made false statements. Instead, the nature of plaintiffs’ evidence is \nmore similar to that in  Hamwi v. Citinational-Buckeye Inv. Co. (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 462, 473, where liability turned on \nthe representations made by lessors to a class of tenants. The court denied class action status because each lease was the \nproduct of individual discussion, and the interpretation of the contract “in each individual instance would involve a separate \ntrial of the issue of meaning based upon extrinsic evidence of those discussions.” (See also  Brown v. Regents of the \nUniversity of California (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 982, 989.) \n14 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \n  \nb. Plaintiffs’ claim that defendants make inadequate assessments in the IPP process \nLike their first claim, plaintiffs’ contentions regarding assessments are very generalized complaints concerning a highly \ncomplex and individualized process. IPPs are the products of interdisciplinary teams convened specially for each consumer. \nNo standard form is employed. As demonstrated by copies *26 of IPPs submitted to the trial court, each IPP includes a \ndetailed analysis of the consumer including medical history and behavioral, cognitive and social functioning. (See, e.g., \n2JS0430-44, 3JS0585-596, 3JS0622-627.) The recommendations of the IPP are tailored to the needs of each consumer and \nthe plan of services and supports is unique to each individual. (Ibid., 3JS0656.) \n  \nPlaintiffs’ complaints regarding the assessment process are non-specific and open ended. (AOB at 29.) They do not base their \nclaim on the explicit policies of the defendants, nor do they identify specifically where the defendants’ assessments have \ngone awry. \n  \nPlaintiffs support their contention that they proffered “common evidence” with only two citations. (AOB at 42.) Neither \ncitation would support a conclusion that common issues predominate. In the first, a former employee of DDS declared that \nstaff at the developmental center where she worked placed “too much emphasis on assessments of an individual’s needs” and \nthat staff had an “institutional bias” without citing any examples. (6JA 1473.) The second citation has nothing to do with the \nIPP process at all, it is to the deposition of a RC director who testified regarding the process for developing the RC’s CPP. In \nany event, the claim that IPP’s are not “comprehensive” can be tested only by reviewing individual cases.7 \n  \nBased on this record, the trial court properly concluded that common issues do not predominate. Noting that “each IPP is \ndesigned by a team of caregivers/specialists for an individual putative class member,” the “alleged *27 legal deficiencies of \neach will be different.” (13JA3613.) The evidence submitted by plaintiffs fully supports the trial court’s observation. The \ncomplaints of inadequate assessment raised on behalf of each plaintiff and putative class member involve a series of highly \nindividualistic factual disputes. \n  \nThe lack of any common thread to the disputes over assessments dooms any effort to resolve plaintiffs’ claims by class \naction. Even if plaintiffs could demonstrate that any one assessment was inadequate, that finding would have no application \nto any other class member given the particularized facts underlying each determination. Where the findings as to the liability \nof defendants to one class member cannot be extrapolated to other class members, then it is appropriate to deny class \ncertification. ( Dunbar v. Albertson’s Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1432.) \n  \nc. Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendants base IPP recommendations on factors unrelated to the needs and choices of the \nclass members \nPlaintiffs contend that defendants have a practice of making placement recommendations on “improper” considerations such \nas the “availability of services” and family objections to placement. (AOB at 42.) This contention cannot be resolved on \ncommon proof. Plaintiffs cannot identify any written policy or directive that requires that interdisciplinary teams employ the \nallegedly improper criteria. The very existence of the supposed policy, a point which is denied by defendants, can only be \ndetermined by reviewing individual cases. Furthermore, even if the criteria were applied, the court would have to determine if \nthe assessment resulted in illegal institutionalization, an issue not amenable to a class-wide adjudication. \n  \nThe “common evidence” of the alleged policy is based entirely on anecdotal testimony consisting of disputes over individual \ncases or hopelessly *28 vague generalized conclusions. (AOB at 42.) For instance, one of plaintiffs’ citations is to deposition \ntestimony about disagreements between a particular individual and a RC regarding the merits of individual community \nfacilities. (6JA1624-1625.) Another citation is to testimony by a RC employee questioning a physician’s decision to require a \ncommunity facility to have oxygen available for a consumer. (6JA1657-1658.) Other testimony cited by plaintiffs is more \nconclusionary. One deponent concluded that DC staff recommended institutional placement out of fear of losing their jobs. \n(7JA 1765.) Another thought that staff had an “institutional bias” because they have worked with individual consumers for a \n15 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nlong time and believe “they’re doing a great job.” (7JA1793.) Plaintiffs allege that DC staff fail to recommend community \nplacement because of the objections of family members. In support of this contention, plaintiffs cite the testimony of one \nadvocate who acknowledges that staff should take the wishes of family into consideration, but that “in some cases” they give \n“more latitude ... than they should.” (6JA 1575.) The same witness acknowledged that this occurs “on an individual basis.” \n(6JA1576.) \n  \nThe inherent unmanageability of plaintiffs’ claims is exemplified in their contention that defendants improperly employ \nsomething they call “readiness criteria” when evaluating placement. (4JA1067.) It is not clear what plaintiffs mean by \n“readiness criteria,” and their witnesses provide different definitions of the term. (9JA2309-2310, 9JA2314, 9JA2318-2319.) \nOthers, including plaintiffs’ own expert Toni Tucker, do not know what the term means. (9JA2336, 9JA2324, 9JA2328, \n9JA2332.) \n  \nEven if the term were defined, a court could not determine whether defendants employ “readiness criteria” or whether it \nresulted in improper *29 institutionalization without deciding highly contested factual disputes in individual cases. For \ninstance, plaintiffs describe four consumers as to whom “inappropriate readiness criteria” have resulted in “unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.”  (10JA2665-2666.)  Defendants  dispute  plaintiffs’  factual  assertions  and  conclusions  as  to  each. \n(3JS0694, 3JS0580-83, 3JS0659-63, 3JS0673-77, 3JS0685-89, 3JS0668-73.) \n  \nThe parties do not agree what the facts are or how to interpret them. These disputes are simply inappropriate for class \ntreatment. More importantly, the propriety of defendants’ actions turns on their professional judgment that the consumer’s \nmedical condition or behaviors make community placement unsafe to the consumer, staff or the public. The trial court \nproperly concluded that there was no commonality in plaintiffs’ contention that defendants employed improper criteria in \ndeveloping IPPs because the “allegedly unlawful variables considered will be different for each IPP.” (14JA3613; see \nMcCullah v. Southern California Gas Company (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 495, 500 (question of whether employer provided \nreasonable accommodation to class of disabled employees not suitable for class certification).) \n  \nd. Plaintiffs’ claim that defendants fail to provide timely services and supports as suggested by IPPs \nThis portion of plaintiffs’ claims is burdened by innumerable individual issues. Plaintiffs’ own evidence is that defendants \ndevelop resources and move consumers from developmental centers to the community “person by person.” (AOB at 43, \nciting 7JA1780.) The claim that defendants have failed to provide services in a timely fashion relies on highly particularized \nfacts and cannot be proven on a class-wide basis. First, the range of services necessary to support class members is incredibly \ndiverse and no two consumers share the same *30 needs. Second, the length of time necessary to develop services will vary \nfrom one consumer to the other. \n  \nIn order to place consumers in the community, defendants have to replicate the services provided in the institution in another \nsetting. These services vary widely among the class members. For instance, one suffers from profound mental retardation, a \nseizure disorder and blindness. He is a very brittle diabetic who requires regular monitoring and currently lives in a skilled \nnursing unit at a developmental center. (3JS0663-664.) Another is a highly verbal young man with mild mental retardation \nwho required treatment in a locked psychiatric facility for mental illness and substance abuse. (3JS734-737.) A third required \nspecialized treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which causes an insatiable appetite and very \nchallenging behavioral needs. (2JS0570-573, 3JS0680.) \n  \nDDS provides funding from the CPP to develop new services if necessary, but they are built around an individual assessment \nof each consumer’s unique needs. (9JA2405.) Nor can plaintiffs’ complaint regarding the time required to develop services \nbe resolved on a class-wide basis. In many cases it is necessary to develop a residence specifically for a particular individual. \n(See, e.g., 3JS0694, 3JS0744-745.) This will have an impact on whether a residence in the community is available. New \ncommunity resources are provided by private vendors who may delay or prevent placement. (1JS0374.) \n  \nThus, the trial court properly concluded that commonality did not exist because of the fact that IPPs are prepared individually \nfor each class member: \n16 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \n*31 The timing of services and supports will, therefore, be determined by the circumstances of the \nindividual. The Court cannot determine that the DDS or a RC acted unlawfully in every case where X \nservice was not provided to Y individual within Z weeks. \n  \n  \n(14JA3613.) \n  \ne. Plaintiffs’ claim that defendants fail to develop adequate community resources \nPlaintiffs contend that defendants have failed to develop a sufficient “array” of services throughout the state sufficient to \ninsure that consumers can receive services in a community setting. The “array” of services necessary to meet the needs of \nclass members is truly breathtaking. Similarly expansive are the unfocused complaints that plaintiffs raise regarding the \navailability  of  community  resources.  As  expected,  every  aspect  of  plaintiffs’  factual  claims  are  subject  to  highly \nindividualized factual disputes. For instance, plaintiffs claim that some institutional residents could live in the community if \nonly defendants developed appropriate community resources. Defendants answer that the consumers have very significant \nmedical and/or behavioral needs which cannot be met outside an institutional setting.. (Compare 10JA2672 to 2JS0452-455, \n3JS0683-684, 3JS0663-665, 3JS0706-708.) In other cases, plaintiffs contend that the services that defendants provided to \nconsumers while they lived in the community were inadequate sometimes causing their institutionalization. Defendants’ \nevidence is that services existed in the community which would have assisted the consumer, but that the consumer’s families \nprevented  defendants  from  delivering  them.  (Compare  10JA2673-2675  to  3JS783-790,  3JS715-722,  3JS728-732, \n3JS0723-727.) \n  \nFurther complicating the commonality analysis is the fact that plaintiffs not only challenge institutionalization in DCs; they \ncontend that class members *32 in any facility with more than 16 beds are improperly institutionalized. There is no \nuniformity as to the reasons class members are admitted to various facilities, the degree to which they are integrated into the \ncommunity, or the reasons they remain in the facilities. Furthermore, the decisions regarding placement in such facilities are \nsolely in the hands of 21 different agencies each of which operates in a completely separate and distinct geographical area of \na state more diverse than most countries. Indeed, the overbreadth of the proposed definition of “institution” completely \nundermines the notion of class certification. The evidence is that RCs treat placements into non-state facilities in very \ndifferent ways. (10JA2458-2564.) \n  \nAll of these factors justified the trial court’s conclusion that this claim would “be dependent on first proving that \nclassmembers have a legal right to a certain type of community resource and that preliminary inquiry is inherently \nindividualized.” (14JA3614.) \n  \n3. Plaintiffs’ Many and Disjointed Arguments Regarding the Trial Court’s Determination That Plaintiffs Had Not \nMet Their Burden Regarding Commonality Should All Be Rejected \nPlaintiffs raise a series of objections to the trial court’s ruling on commonality, much of which involves constructing straw \nmen for the purpose of dispatching them. Plaintiffs’ mischaracterize the trial court’s ruling and then demonstrate how the \ncourt was incorrect to adopt a position it never took. Contrary to plaintiffs’ reading of the ruling below, the trial court’s ruling \nis based on California, and not federal, law; the court did not refuse to aggregate claims; nor did it “find commonality under \nSav-On.” The plaintiffs are wrong when they argue that the court focused improperly on *33 individual issues or that they \nadvanced sufficient evidence of common questions to justify certifying a class. \n  \na. The Claims Analyzed by the Trial Court Were the Claims Identified by the Plaintiffs \n17 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nPlaintiffs level a series of related criticisms against the trial court’s ruling. They contend that the trial court failed to analyze \ntheir motion for class certification in light of their theories of recovery, that it focused on “discrete wrongs” instead of the \naggregate claims of the class and that it improperly relied on evidence plaintiffs submitted in support of typicality rather than \ntheir evidence relating to commonality. None of these arguments accurately reflect the ruling below and all are mistaken. \n  \nThe trial court, as required by California law, determined whether common questions predominated in light of the claims \nasserted by the plaintiffs. (14JA3609, citing  Hicks, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at 916, 917-18.) Plaintiffs cannot credibly \nclaim that the five “alleged wrongs” the trial court analyzed are not in fact their principal claims in this action. A review of \nthe issues, both factual and legal, listed in their moving papers match those analyzed by the trial court. (See 10JA1065-1066, \n1076-1077, 1080.) As plaintiffs themselves described their claims: “Each of plaintiffs’ causes of action is based on the right \nof class members to assessments of the services and supports they need to avoid unnecessary institutionalization and live in \nthe least restrictive environment, and then to receive those services and supports in a timely manner.” (10JA2638.) In other \nwords, the “discrete wrongs” identified by the trial court essentially mirror the factual and legal issues plaintiffs contend are \ncommon. (4JA1066-67, 1076-77, 1080; 10JA2638-2639.) \n  \n*34 Similarly, plaintiffs’ contention that the court below failed to “aggregate” their claims is simply wrong. (AOB at 30-34.) \nIn fact, the five alleged wrongs analyzed by the court were wrongs that plaintiffs claimed affected all class members. \nPlaintiffs should not be heard to complain about the approach the trial court took; it took plaintiffs’ claims as they defined \nthem. Plaintiffs specifically disavowed the approach advocated by defendants. (10JA2637.) The trial court here aggregated \nplaintiffs’ claims - that is, it did not analyze each cause of action - and examined the claims to determine whether they could \nbe established through common proof, as the court did in Sav-On. Therefore, plaintiffs’ claim that the trial court did not \naggregate their claims in contravention of California law is nonsensical. \n  \nAdditionally, plaintiffs’ contention that the trial court erroneously followed  J.B. by Hart v. Valdez (10th Cir. 1999)186 \nF.3d 1280, 1289 for the proposition that “an allegation of systemic failures does not create a common legal issue” and the \n“disallowance” of the “aggregate approach” as “contrary” to California law must also be rejected. (AOB at 31.) Neither the \ntrial court nor the Valdez court held that class actions may not address violations of the law that are “systemic.” However, \ncommonality does not exist merely because plaintiffs allege that it does. As the court in Valdez observed, “We refuse to hold, \nas a matter of law, that any allegation of a systematic violation of various laws automatically meets  Rule 23(a)(2).” \n( 186 F.3d at 1289, emphasis in original.) In reaching this conclusion, the decision in Valdez is completely consistent with \nCalifornia law. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ complaint that the trial court somehow improperly based its decision on facts and evidence that they offered \nregarding the typicality requirement also must be rejected. (AOB at 38.) The trial court was not *35 precluded from \nconsidering any of the evidence submitted by the parties as to any issue when it was determining whether common issues \npredominate. “ ‘[Q]uestions as to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the construction to be put upon it, the inferences \nto be drawn therefrom, the credibility of witnesses ... and the determination of [any] conflicts and inconsistency in their \ntestimony are matters for the trial court to resolve.’ ” ( Sav-On, 34 Cal.4th at 334, quoting  Thompson v. City of Long \nBeach (1953) 41 Cal.2d 235, 246.) Moreover, the trial court did not specifically cite to any particular evidence, but since it \ndenied all the parties’ evidentiary objections, it can be presumed that the court considered all the evidence submitted by the \nparties. \n  \nIndeed, plaintiffs themselves had difficulty distinguishing between evidence that relates to typicality from that which relates \nto commonality. For instance, plaintiffs’ reply brief to the trial court included an Attachment A which purported to be \nsummaries of “common evidence” as to individual plaintiffs and putative class members. (10JA2662-2679.) The table \ncategorized the “common evidence” under broad contentions. The five “discrete wrongs” cited by the trial court closely track \nthe contentions listed in plaintiffs’ Attachment A. Plaintiffs cited the evidence to demonstrate plaintiffs’ and putative class \nmembers’ “commonality and typicality.” (10JA2643.) \n  \nPlaintiffs can hardly fault the trial court for considering the factual issues cited by plaintiffs as “common” in determining \nwhether plaintiffs had satisfied the requirement of commonality. Therefore, their contention that the trial court ignored their \ntheory of liability is completely incorrect. \n18 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \n  \n*36 b. Plaintiffs’ “Pattern and Practice” Evidence Fails to Establish Commonality. \nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred when it “rejected” their “pattern and practice” evidence. (AOB at 39.) In this \ncontention, plaintiffs are off base for two reasons. First, they ignore the standard of review; their burden is not to demonstrate \nthat there was evidence which could have supported the trial court in reaching a contrary result, but whether substantial \nevidence supported the conclusion the court did reach. Secondly, the common evidence they cite is insufficient to prove the \nclaims they raise in this litigation. In fact, the trial court did not err; it properly concluded that, based on all the evidence \nsubmitted by the parties, plaintiffs’ claims could not be proved through common proof. \n  \nPlaintiffs  contend  they  demonstrated  commonality  by  “pattern  and  practice  evidence  consisting  of  testimony  from \nDefendants about their policies and practices, admissions, documents, expert testimony, sampling and other evidence.” (AOB \nat 41.) They also contend that they “described their intended use of statistics and further sampling for trial.” (Ibid.) The \nevidence they cite is insufficient to demonstrate that common questions predominate. \n  \nThe court properly concluded that plaintiffs’ claims could not be proved by statistical or sampling evidence. (14JA3612, \n14JA3619.) With regard to sampling, state defendants’ expert, Richard Scheffler, PhD., testified: “In my opinion, with \nrespect to [plaintiffs’ contentions as described in Attachment 2], it would not be possible under accepted principles of social \nscience research to conduct a study based on such sampling that would provide scientifically reliable results.” (10JA2460.) \nAnother of defendants’ experts, Julia Mullen, expressed the same opinion. (9JA2411.) In response, plaintiffs’ submitted the \n*37 testimony of Lyn Rucker who acknowledged that she is not a statistician and that she had to consult with someone else to \nrender  her  opinions  about  Dr.  Scheffler’s  testimony.  (12JA3097.)  Ms.  Rucker  opined  that  sampling  “could  help  to \ndemonstrate” some of plaintiffs’ allegations, but conceded that, “ contentions, such as defendants’ failure to establish a \nsufficient array of community services to meet the needs of persons in institutions, would not necessarily be proved by \nsampling.” (12JA3099.) Thus, given the testimony of the parties’ experts regarding sampling, the trial court did not err when \nit determined that the case could not be tried based on sampling or statistical proof at trial. (14JA3612, 3619.)8 \n  \nIn view of the evidence submitted by defendants, this court must accept the trial court’s conclusion that plaintiffs’ claims \ncould not be proven by sampling and statistical evidence. State defendants submitted substantial evidence that the claims \nraised by plaintiffs were not subject to statistical proof. Therefore, plaintiffs’ argument that their expert’s testimony should be \nbelieved over that of the state defendants is simply irrelevant. ( Grappo v. Coventry Financial Corp. (1991) 235 \nCal.App.3d 496, 507.) \n  \nMore importantly, an examination of the evidence plaintiffs actually did present to the trial does not establish that common \nissues predominated or that those issues could be established through common proof. The remaining evidence fails to \ndemonstrate  commonality.  (4JA1063-1066.)  The  fact  that  the  majority  of  individuals  could  theoretically  live  in  the \ncommunity or that the state has a plan to close one DC and move the majority of its residents to community homes does not \npertain to whether defendants are failing *38 to perform adequate assessments or failing to create sufficient or timely \ncommunity resources. \n  \nSimilarly, plaintiffs claim that DDS does not maintain “wait lists” for individuals in private institutions and the testimony of a \nstaff member that at Sonoma DC under the new community options guidelines no “referral list” will be maintained does not \ngo to establishing any of plaintiffs’ claims. Again, plaintiffs do not explain how this evidence is common to the class or even \nrelevant to proving their claim that defendants have a practice or policy of failing to provide or ensure the development of \ncommunity-based services. \n  \nIn direct contrast, the plaintiffs in Sav-On proffered evidence that established they could prove their claims with common \nproof. The court identified as the central issue whether certain identical work tasks were “managerial” or “nonmanagerial.” \nThe court noted that this was an issue that could “easily be resolved on a class-wide basis by assigning each task to one side \nof the ‘ledger.’ ” (Id. at 331.) Thus, the Supreme Court concluded: “A reasonable court could conclude that issues respecting \nthe proper legal classification of [these managers’] actual activities, along with issues respecting [Sav-On’s] policies and \npractices and issues respecting operational standardization, are likely to predominate in a class proceeding over any \n19 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nindividualized calculations of actual overtime hours that might ultimately prove necessary.” (Id. at 331.) \n  \nUnlike in Sav-On, this is not a case where the trial court could resolve any of the issues raised by plaintiffs’ complaint by \nexamining evidence common to the class. It simply is not possible for plaintiffs to establish liability against defendants for \nthe alleged violation of dozens of Lanterman Act provisions as well as the ADA, numerous provisions of the Medicaid Act, \nand *39 various federal and state constitutional provisions with proof that is common to the putative class. This not a case \nwhere the salient facts can be placed on one side of a ledger as opposed to another. Thus, the trial court correctly determined: \n“[I]t is clear that class certification is not proper given the individualized factual and legal issues the trier of fact would need \nto consider in reaching a decision.” (14JA3619.) \n  \nc. The trial court did not improperly “focus” on individual issues \nPlaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred by improperly focusing on individual claims as opposed to the system-wide \ndeficiencies they allege. (AOB at 30-31.) However, the trial court did not find -- nor did defendants ever argue -- that class \ncertification should be denied because individuals had different claims or sought different relief. Contrary to plaintiffs’ \nclaims, the trial court did not “focus” on individuals’ placements, the individualized content of their IPPs, or the individuals’ \nright to individual relief. (Ibid.) In fact, the trial court “considered that Plaintiffs are seeking systemwide injunctive relief \nonly and are not seeking individualized relief.” (14JA3607.) Thus, there was never a question that the trial court was \nanalyzing plaintiffs’ claims as seeking class wide injunctive relief, not relief for any individual. \n  \nAccordingly, the cases cited by plaintiffs to support their contention that the trial court improperly focused on individual \nissues  are  inapposite  here.  (AOB  at  24-28.)  Indeed,  the  cases  support  the  trial  court’s  determination  to  deny  class \ncertification. \n  \n*40 In each of those cases (save  Alch v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 339, which did not involve any class \ncertification issues),9 the court determined that the fact that there may be some issues that do not apply to all class members \nor that not all class members would be entitled to relief was not enough to defeat class certification. In each of those cases, \nthe court determined that common issues predominated. For example, in  Mendoza v. County of Tulare (1982) 128 \nCal.App.3d 403, prisoners challenged the conditions in a county jail, claiming that the county was in violation of various \nconstitutional provisions, the Civil Rights Act and the California Penal and Health and Safety Codes. The court determined \nthat although there were some issues that were only applicable to some prisoners, the complaint contained many allegations \napplicable to all persons in custody at the county jail, including the failure to maintain a licensed physician, inadequate \nmedical treatment, failure to allow phone calls to attorneys, and the failure to provide access to an adequate law library. (Id. \nat 417.) Some allegations were only applicable to pretrial detainees and inmate drug addicts. The court concluded: “Although \nthe causes of action set forth in [the] complaint reveal some questions of law that are inapplicable to the class as a whole, \ncommon questions substantially outweigh those applicable only to separate categories of the class.” (Id. at 418.) \n  \nSimilarly, in  Reyes v. Board of Supervisors (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1263, plaintiffs sought certification of a class of \nindividuals who had been denied general relief benefits for failure to comply with work project rules. *41 The only issue \nbefore the court was the legality of the county’s sanctioning process. “This common question requirement is patently satisfied \nhere by the class claim the County has violated state law by failing to distinguish between willful violations of work rules by \ncompetent healthy adults who may be sanctioned and nonwillful violations caused by negligence, inadvertence or mental or \nphysical disability which may not serve as the basis for sanctioning.” (Id. at 1277.) The court concluded that the county’s \nadministrative agency would decide the remaining issues of individual recipient qualification, entitlement and amount of \ndamages. (Ibid.) \n  \nUnlike in Mendoza and Reyes, common issues which can be established through common proof do not predominate in this \ncase. In analyzing the nature of the evidence that would be required to prove plaintiffs’ claims, the trial court determined that \nthe trier of fact would be required “to pay significant attention to the individual circumstances of class members.” \n(14JA3619.) Thus, the trial court did not improperly “focus” on individual cases; it merely examined plaintiffs’ claims and \nthe evidence proffered, and concluded that it could not determine defendants’ liability without considering the facts of \n20 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nthousands of individual cases. \n  \nd. Plaintiffs’ Contention That the Trial Court Found That They Had Met the Test of Commonality under Sav-On Is a \nMisreading of the Ruling Below \nA centerpiece of plaintiffs’ brief is that the “Superior Court held that Plaintiffs had met the test for commonality under \nSav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 24 Cal.4th 319 through evidence that Defendants have acted or refused to \nact on grounds generally applicable to the class.” (AOB *42 at 2.) Plaintiffs misconstrue both the trial court ruling in this case \nand the supreme court’s decision in Sav-On. \n  \nThe first problem with plaintiffs’ contention is that the test that they attribute to the Sav-On decision appears no where in the \ncase. The supreme court in Sav-On stated that the test for commonality in California is whether common issues predominate. \n(24 Cal.4th at 327.) The test described by plaintiffs in their brief is the test under  FRCP 23(b)(2). The phrase “acted or \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class” is not used at all in Sav-On. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ contention is all the more mysterious in light of the trial court’s explicit ruling on commonality. The trial court \nexamined the evidence under what it described as the “standard commonality analysis” described in Sav-On and other \nCalifornia cases, and concluded that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden. (14JA3611, 14JA3612-4, 14JA3619.) \n  \nThe trial court also analyzed whether plaintiffs met the requirement of commonality under the federal rules. It was \nunnecessary for the court to do so. “It is only in the absence of relevant state precedent that courts turn to federal law and \nrule 23 for guidance.” (Stephen v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car (1991)235 Cal.App.3d 806,814, citations omitted, emphasis in \noriginal.) This is especially the case where federal law has a different test for commonality than under California law. A class \naction under  FRCP 23(b)(2) has no predominance or superiority requirement. ( Barnes v. American Tobacco Co. (3rd \nCir.1998) 161 F.3d 127, 143.) However, California courts require that common questions predominate even where the \nplaintiff seeks injunctive relief. (Block v. Major League Baseball (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 538, 544-545.) \n  \n*43 In any event, the court concluded that it would have denied plaintiffs’ motion even under the federal test. Although the \ntrial court found “there is evidence that the Defendants had policies that were common and affected each member of the \nputative class,” it would “still deny the motion for class certification because the claims asserted would require the trier of \nfact to pay significant attention to the individual circumstances of class members.” (10JA3619.) \n  \nD. The Superior Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding That Named Plaintiffs Are Not Adequate Class \nRepresentatives \nIn holding that the named plaintiffs were not adequate class representatives,10 the trial court found: \n  \nIn this case the named plaintiffs are legitimately pursuing claims that they honestly think are in the best interests of all the \nabsent class members. The problem is that reasonable minds can differ and the Intervenors, who represent a sizeable number \nof absent class members, think that prosecution of the claims is not in their best interest. \n  \n(14JA3616.) \n  \nBased on this finding the court concluded: “[T]hat Plaintiffs have not demonstrated either (1) they will adequately represent \nthe interests of all members of the class or (2) the interest of the Intervenors can be adequately protected by their presence in \nthis case.” (14JA3617.) These findings are supported by substantial evidence, are based on proper legal criteria, and should \ntherefore be affirmed. ( Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435-436.) \n  \n*44 Plaintiffs’ assertion that the trial court’s holding is inconsistent with the decision in  Richmond, supra, 29 Cal.3d 462 \n21 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nis incorrect. (AOB at 49-53.) Richmond was an action by a group of homeowners against a developer for its alleged failure to \nprovide adequate infrastructure for the home sites. The homeowners’ association, in which the developer had a controlling \ninterest,  intervened  and  successfully  opposed  class  certification  on  the  ground  that  plaintiffs  were  inadequate  class \nrepresentatives because the association’s survey showed that 6% of the class might be antagonistic to the case. \n  \nThe court defined the “essential question presented” to be whether “antagonism per se by members of a class should \nautomatically preclude certification of a class.” (Id. at 473.) In rejecting such a rule, the court held that where antagonism to \nthe class suit demonstrates a conflict “that goes to the very subject matter of the litigation,” a party is not an adequate class \nrepresentative, unless this antagonism can be removed through the use of subclasses or intervention by the dissident class \nmembers. (Id. at 470-471, citation and internal quotation marks omitted.) \n  \nThus, in  J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 113 Cal.App.4th 195, the court found that conflicts between \nplaintiffs and absent class members precluded class certification in an antitrust suit. Citing Richmond, the court explained that \nwhether a conflict defeats a party’s claim of representative status entails an evaluation of “the seriousness and extent of \nconflicts involved compared to the importance of issues uniting the class; the alternatives to class representation available; \nthe procedures available to limit and prevent unfairness; and any other facts bearing on the fairness with which the absent \nclass member is represented.” (Id. at 212, citation omitted, internal quotation marks omitted.) \n  \n*45 In this case, there is an additional factor that was not at issue in either Richmond or J.P. Morgan: plaintiffs seek only \ninjunctive and declaratory relief. In such a case - in contrast to damage actions like Richmond and J.P. Morgan - the trial \ncourt is not required to provide class members with notice and an opportunity to opt out. ( Holmes v. California Nat’l \nGuard (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 297, 309 fn.8.) Consequently, class members can be bound by an injunction with which they \nvigorously disagree. For this reason, courts require far greater cohesiveness among class members in cases like the present \none. (See, e.g.,  Barnes, supra, 161 F.3d 127 at142-143.) Indeed, the court in Richmond acknowledged the role the right to \nopt-out plays in mitigating possible conflicts by offering “additional protection”: to absent class members who do not wish to \nbe bound by the result of the suit. ( Richmond, supra, 29 Cal.3d at 474.) Likewise, in conjunction with its finding that class \ncertification should not be denied because 6% of the potential class members may be antagonistic, the court stated: “It should \nalso be noted that the trial court will be in a better position to assess the true feelings of the class after court-approved, \nobjectively worded notice is sent to the entire class and the absent members are given an opportunity to elect nonparticipation \nin the lawsuit.” (Id. at 475, fn 10.) \n  \nA leading authority on class actions has explained, in the analogous context of  Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the importance of an opt-out right in assessing the effect of the conflict. A class action under  FRCP 23(b)(3) \nfor damages may avoid the negative impact of conflict among class members because dissenters may opt out, “limiting the \nclass to those who favor the suit.” (1 Newberg on Class Actions, §3:30.) \n  \n*46 1. The conflict between plaintiffs and intervenors goes to the “subject matter of the litigation” \nThe evidence presented to the trial court fully supports a finding that the conflict between intervenors’ position and the aims \nof the named plaintiffs goes to the very subject matter of the case. The deep-rooted and extensive differences between \nintervenors and plaintiffs entirely outweigh the few, if any, issues uniting the proposed class. \n  \nAt the outset of the case, plaintiffs opposed the intervenors’ motion to intervene - a stance which, in itself, demonstrates \nantagonism toward the intervenors. Plaintiffs’ antagonism was made explicit in their opposition memorandum: “The \norganizations’ and parent representatives’ interests are potentially and actually in conflict with the interests of the plaintiffs \nand the putative class.” (1JA0265, emphasis added.) Plaintiffs’ efforts now to show that there is no conflict are disingenuous \nat best. \n  \nPlaintiffs now argue that no conflict exists because, as the trial court recognized, both plaintiffs and intervenors “would like \nthorough assessments and the best service possible.” (AOB at 53.) This is like saying that two antagonistic political parties \n22 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nare not in conflict because each wants “good government.” \n  \nPlaintiffs’ explicit premise is that the present system for providing services to persons with developmental disabilities is \nfundamentally broken and illegal. In their view, the problems are systemic, not individual. (AOB at 32.) Plaintiffs contend \nthat the least restrictive, most appropriate environment for virtually  all persons with developmental disabilities is a \ncommunity, non-institutional setting. Plaintiffs envision the elimination of all “institutions” with more than 16 beds, \nincluding the closure of the DCs. *47 Consequently, the class-wide relief plaintiffs seek is a detailed injunction designed to \nensure that assessments and the provision of services are directed at, and result in, community placements. (4JA1038-41.) In \nshort, the whole point of plaintiffs’ lawsuit is to compel deinstitutionalization. \n  \nIntervenors have a sharply different vision and perspective. While they accept that for some persons with developmental \ndisabilities a community setting is appropriate, they vigorously assert that others are so profoundly impaired that a DC, with \nits centralized, constant protection and care, provides the least restrictive and safest environment, whether or not community \nplacement opportunities become available. (JA2027; JA2031; JA2039; JA2058-59; JA2062-63; JA2069-70; JA2073-2074; \nJA2081-2082.) \n  \nIntervenors contend that the plaintiffs’ broad assertions about the alleged defects in the system are either wrong or highly \nquestionable. For example, a Director of CASH/PCR (a parents group of individuals who reside in DCs and an intervenor \nhere) testified that individuals and their families are given understandable information on community services and supports to \nenable them to make meaningful choices. (JA2040.) He believes that when the IPP recommends DC placement “it is the \nresult of thoughtful consideration by a critical collection of uniquely qualified professionals” and “vigorously disagrees with \nplaintiffs’ contention that the IPP process is fundamentally flawed in favor of DC placement ....” (JA2040-41.) \n  \nAll of the declarations submitted by Intervenors challenged plaintiffs’ view that residing in the community was always \nsuperior to life in the developmental centers. (See JA2058-59; JA2062-63; JA2069; JA2073.) Intervenors also testified about \nexplicit antagonism they experienced with *48 Protection & Advocacy, the lead counsel in this case. (See JA2080-81; \nJA2072.) \n  \nIn sum, the substantial and unrefuted evidence of a fundamental conflict between plaintiffs and intervenors supports the trial \ncourt’s finding that plaintiffs will not adequately protect the interest of the intervenors. \n  \n2. The Number of Intervenors Does Not Preclude a Finding that Plaintiffs Are Inadequate Class Representatives \nPlaintiffs argue that under Richmond representative status is precluded only where a “vast majority” of the putative class is \nantagonistic to the position of the named plaintiffs, and that intervenors fall short because they represent a mere “handful” of \nclass members. (AOB at pp. 51-52.) This argument misconstrues Richmond and is wrong on the facts. \n  \nRichmond confirms that class certification is inappropriate “[w]hen a vast majority of the class perceives its interest as \ndiametrically opposed to that of the named representatives ...” ( Richmond, 29 Cal.3d at 471.) “If a vast majority of the \nclass do not oppose the suit, the minority may have its views presented either as a subclass or as interveners.” (Ibid.) These \nstatements should not be construed as holding that when the dissenters are something less than a “vast majority,” intervention \nor a subclass must, as a matter of law, must be adopted as the solution to the conflict. Instead, the statements should be read \nas a directive that where less than a vast majority dissents, the conflict, when the circumstances warrant, may be mitigated \nthrough the use of subclasses or intervention. This reading properly preserves the trial court’s flexibility to determine - \nwhatever the number of dissenters - whether there are procedures available to prevent unfairness or whether the antagonism, \ndespite the procedures, defeats the plaintiffs’ claim of representative status. \n  \n*49 Plaintiffs make two arguments based on the number of intervenors in relation to the entire class. Neither has merit. They \nfirst assert that intervenors “consist of only 11 individuals” or less than.1% of the 7775 member class.11 (AOB at 51.) This \nargument conveniently disregards the intervenor organizations, CASH/PCR and California Association for the Retarded \nwhich include the families or conservators of half of the approximately 3,100 residents of DCs as members. (JA2040.) \n  \n23 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \nAcknowledging this fact, plaintiffs change tack and argue that when the approximately 4,600 putative class members, who \nreside in non-developmental center facilities, are added to the 3,100 residents of the developmental centers, intervenors’ \npercentage of the putative class drops to about 20%. (AOB at 52.) In addition to the fact that 20% of the proposed class - \napproximately 1,500 consumers - is not a mere “handful” or a small minority, this argument fails to take into account that \nintervenors do not claim to represent the interests of consumers outside the DCs. Thus, to the extent it is relevant, the proper \npoint of comparison is intervenors’ percentage of the DC population - nearly 50%, not their percentage of the entire putative \nclass. \n  \nIn addition, plaintiffs offered no evidence showing how many DC residents and consumers in facilities with 16 or more beds \nagree with the suit’s claims and objectives. It may well be that a relatively small percentage of class members concur with \nplaintiffs. Plaintiffs have not shown otherwise. \n  \n*50 Plaintiffs’ attempt to marginalize the intervenors’ view by arguing that they make up a legally insignificant portion of the \nclass is contradicted by substantial and unrebutted evidence. Accordingly, the trial court clearly did not abuse its discretion \nwhen it concluded that representative status was defeated because the intervenors represent “a sizable number of class \nmembers” who think the prosecution of the action is not in “their best interest.” (14JA3616.) \n  \n3. Intervention Does Not Sufficiently Mitigate the Conflict \nAlthough intervenors are parties to the case, their status does not “cure” the conflict so as to allow plaintiffs to be adequate \nclass representatives. At the heart of the conflict is an unbridgeable philosophical schism on the central issue of what \nconstitutes the “most integrated, least restrictive environment.” Plaintiffs fervently believe that with proper services and \nsupports all DC residents can live in the community. Plaintiffs and their attorneys are determined, through lawsuits, \nlegislation and lobbying, to mold the system to fit this conception. This case is part of that effort. \n  \nIntervenors just as ardently believe that for a large number of consumers the DC provides the most integrated, least restrictive \nenvironment. In their view, community placement for these consumers would be unsafe and result in a marked decrease in \nthe quality of life. \n  \nThis irreconcilable hostility precludes plaintiffs from being accorded representative status, even though intervenors are \nparties. A class action is not a devise to force opposing factions within the class to do battle - one as the class representative \nand one as an intervenor. Rather, it is a procedure that may be used to “sue or defend for the benefit of all,” (Code Civ. Proc. \n§ 382), and only where the party seeking certification establishes “a well-defined *51 community of interest among the class \nmembers.” (Richmond, supra, 29 Cal.3d at470.) Here, plaintiffs seek to impose through a system-wide injunction their view \nof what is “for the benefit of all” in a situation where there is clearly no well-defined community of interest. \n  \nThis  lack  of  cohesiveness  among  class  members  is  all  the  more  important  in  judging  the  adequacy  of  plaintiffs’ \nrepresentation because, given that the suit seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief, intervenors and the members of their \nassociations cannot elect to opt-out of the class. (14JA3617.) Therefore, should judgment be entered for the putative class, \nintervenors would likely be subject to an injunction with which they disagree, as well as the res judicata/collateral estoppel \neffects of the judgment. \n  \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the trial court’s determination that plaintiffs were not adequate representatives is supported \nby substantial evidence and is based on proper legal criteria. This finding should therefore be affirmed. \n  \nE. The Trial Court Did Not Err in Finding that Plaintiffs’ Claims Could Be Addressed Through Alternative Means \nIn assessing the suitability of class certification, the trial court addressed two issues. The court first considered the possible \nrole a class action would play in deterring and redressing alleged government wrongdoing - in this case, primarily \ndefendants’ alleged failure to perform proper assessments and the alleged failure to provide adequate community services. \nThe court next considered the availability of alternatives to a class action for handling the controversy. On the first issue, the \n24 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \ncourt found that “the alleged wrongs cannot be readily cured on a class wide basis.” On the second, the court concluded that \nthe Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedure was an effective means for *52 individuals to seek relief for alleged unlawful \ninstitutionalization.  (14JA3618.)  Both  holdings  are  correct.  Each  follows  from  the  court’s  determination  that  “the \ndevelopment and implementation of the IPPs is inherently individualized”- a proposition with which plaintiffs fully concur. \n(Ibid.) \n  \n1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a class action is not an effective procedure for deterring \nalleged wrongdoing \nIn finding that a class action is not an effective procedure for deterring alleged illegal institutionalization, the trial court \ncontrasted this case with cases in which “the class claims are generally discrete and capable of resolution by a court on a \ncommon basis.” (14JA3618.) In these types of cases, a finding that a policy or practice applicable to all class members is \nillegal results in class-wide injunctive relief that resolves the ultimate issue in the case, e.g., a desegregation plan applicable \nto all class members or an injunction prohibiting the denial of welfare benefits based on a policy that has been unlawfully \napplied to all class members. \n  \nIn  contrast,  in  this  case  it  is  uncontested  that  the  determination  of  whether  a  putative  class  member  is  illegally \ninstitutionalized can be made only after an individualized assessment. It is further uncontested that placement in a less \nrestrictive environment can only be accomplished by the procurement of service and supports tailored to the unique needs of \neach consumer. Thus, the final result sought by this lawsuit requires resolution of issues which, by their very nature, cannot \nbe decided on a class-wide basis. \n  \nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court’s conclusion is wrong because “this case involves conduct that harms large numbers of \npeople in systematic ways that are beyond the means of any individual plaintiff to prosecute through years of factual and \nexpert discovery, much less trial.” (AOB at 62.) This argument *53 misses the point. No matter the exact form of the \nplaintiffs’ proposed systemic injunctive relief, the wrong - alleged illegal institutionalization of individual putative class \nmembers - can, in the end, only be redressed through a process which is individualized. The trial court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in finding that “the alleged wrongs cannot be readily cured on a class wide basis.” \n  \n2. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedure is an \neffective means for putative class members to seek relief \nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedure provides an effective \nmeans for putative class members to seek placement in a less restrictive environment. (14JA3618.) \n  \nAs an integral part of the Lanterman Act, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive and detailed fair hearing procedure. \n(§§4700 et seq.) The Act makes fair hearings the exclusive remedy for issues relating to the provision of services. Thus, \nsection 4706(a) provides that fair hearings are to be used to decide “all issues concerning the rights of persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities to receive services under [the Act].” (Emphasis added.) Consistent with this directive, section \n4710.5(a) confers a right to a fair hearing on any applicant or recipient of services or their authorized representative “who is \ndissatisfied with any decision or action of a service agency12 which he or she believes to be illegal, discriminatory, or not in \nthe recipient’s or applicant’s best interest.” This language certainly encompasses a claim that an individual is improperly \ninstitutionalized (as defined by plaintiffs). \n  \n*54 In addition, the fact that the Legislature has made the fair hearing procedure the exclusive remedy for issues relating to \nthe provision of services counsels strongly against class certification. As correctly noted by the trial court, the enactment of \nthe procedure supports a presumption “that the Legislature considered this to be an effective means for individuals to seek \nrelief.” (14JA3618.) \n  \nPlaintiffs’ arguments relating to the adequacy of fair hearings are without merit. Specifically, they assert that fair hearings \ncannot address or afford the class-wide relief sought in the action. While it may be correct that a hearing officer could not \n25 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \ngrant the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek, this does not mean that the fair hearing procedure is an ineffective remedy. The \nprimary objective of the systemic injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs is individualized assessments aimed at community \nplacements tailored to the unique needs of each individual consumer. For any putative class member who is dissatisfied with \nhis/her current assessment or placement, this objective can be achieved through the Act’s fair hearing process. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on  Ramos v. County of Madera (1971) 4 Cal.3d 685 is misplaced. In Ramos, plaintiffs challenged the \nCounty’s policy of requiring children under age16 to work harvesting grapes as a condition for receipt of AFDC benefits. (Id. \nat 690-691.) \n  \nUnlike in Ramos, the issue in the present case is not whether the Lanterman Act’s fair hearing procedure contemplates class \ninjunctive  relief.  Rather,  individual  fair  hearings  are  an  effective  means  for  challenging  alleged  *55  unlawful \ninstitutionalization - the primary wrong alleged in the complaint. The proposed class-wide relief is not needed to achieve this \nresult.13 \n  \nPlaintiffs also argue that DDS and the other state defendants are not a “service agency” with respect to putative class \nmembers residing in “non-DC institutions,” and therefore these individuals have no fair hearing remedy against the State \ndefendants. (AOB at 55.) Although this assertion is accurate, it is not relevant. It is the RCs, not the state defendants, who are \nresponsible for placing persons in “non-DC institutions.” (2JS361-62.) In this context, the RCs are the “service agencies” for \nthese consumers and as such their assessment and placement decisions can be the subject to a fair hearing. DDS and the other \nstate defendants are not necessary parties. \n  \nAdditionally, plaintiffs contend that class treatment is superior to “thousands of individual actions.” However, these are not \nthe alternatives. Neither the trial court nor defendants are suggesting that each putative class member be required to bring an \naction seeking the relief sought by plaintiffs in this case. Nor, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion, are they contending that one \nclass member bring a test case. (AOB at 59-60.) Instead, the trial court found that the fair hearing process, as opposed to a \nclass action or many individual lawsuits, is an effective remedy for any putative class member who believes he/she should be \nin a less restrictive environment.14 Thus, in the court’s view, *56 the fair hearing process is adequate to achieve what \nplaintiffs themselves state is the objective of this action, namely, “[t]o ensure California’s promise (codified in §§ 4501 & \n4502) to persons with developmental disabilities of an entitlement to an opportunity to live integrated in the community by \nbeing served in the least restrictive setting.” (AOB at 59.) \n  \nPlaintiffs also argue that a class action is needed because “individualized violations are difficult to articulate and prove.” \n(AOB at 60.) If this is true, then plaintiffs have no case. Whatever the alleged “systemic” policies or practices, if plaintiffs \ncannot establish that they result in the unlawful institutionalization of individual putative class members, then plaintiffs’ \ntheory of the case fails. \n  \nPlaintiffs’ further contention that a class is warranted because putative class members are persons with cognitive or other \nsevere disabilities, who do not have the resources to sue all the defendants in this case is inapposite. (Ibid.) Again, the trial \ncourt did not find that individual actions should be pursued; only that the Legislature has determined that the fair hearing \nprocess is an effective and appropriate device for resolving problems that persons with developmental disabilities may have \nwith the nature or type of services being provided to them. \n  \nFinally, plaintiffs assert that a writ of mandate is not a substitute for a class action because class members do not have \nstanding to enforce a writ of mandate if one is obtained by the named plaintiffs. (AOB at 61.) This argument should be \nrejected because non-parties (e.g., putative class members) who contend that a writ of mandate is not being properly enforced \nby the plaintiffs may intervene in the action. (See, e.g.,  Bustop v. Superior Court (1997) 69 Cal.App.3d 66, 70.) \n  \n*57 IV. CONCLUSION \nThis is the kind of case which cannot conceivably be proved on a class wide basis. Defendants do not disagree that class \nactions are appropriate to test the legality of truly uniform governmental policies or practices. However, this is not such a \n26 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \ncase. The trial court’s conclusion that class certification did not serve the interests of the parties, the court or the public was a \nproper one. \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code. \n   \n2  The contracts require RCs to comply with federal and state law. (§ 4629.) The process for terminating a contract is strictly \n  regulated under the Act. (§§ 4629(d), 4632, 4635.) \n \n3  For instance, plaintiffs contend that one developmental center resident was subjected to “inappropriate readiness criteria” because \n  defendants’ planning focuses on “addressing her behaviors to make her ready for transition rather than on assessment and \ndevelopment of community services or supports ...” (10JA2665.) Defendants’ evidence was that the resident has had a consistent \npattern of failed placements, the most recent of which had failed due to her dangerous behaviors, including elopement and \nprostitution. (2JS0400, 3JS0693-696.) In another case, plaintiffs alleged that one class member had been placed in an institution \n“without first conducting an assessment to see if he could be deflected.....” (10JA2668.) Defendants submitted evidence that the \nconsumer voluntarily chose the placement following visits to other facilities and stated afterward that he was happy with the \nplacement and did not want to move. (3JS0599-605.) \n \n4  “The appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. When two or more inferences \n  can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.” \n( Shamblin v. Brattain (1988) 44 Cal.3d 474, 478-479,citations omitted.) \n \n5 \nInstead, plaintiffs concentrate almost exclusively on what the trial court described as- an “alternative approach” under  Federal \n \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). (See 14JA3614, 3619.) \n \n6  The trial court’s selection of these five claims is a fair summary of the legal and factual issues raised by plaintiffs case. \n   \n7  It is difficult to describe the IPPs prepared by defendants which are in the record as anything but comprehensive. (See e.g., \n  2JS0430-444, 3JS0585-596, 3JS0622-627.) Whether they took more or less time than the CPPs described in plaintiffs’ evidence \nand whether they adequately assessed the needs and wants of the consumer can only be determined on a case-by-case basis. \n \n8  Plaintiffs never explained what “statistical” evidence they would submit. \n   \n9  In Alch, the issue before the court was whether a classwide claim under the Fair Employment and Housing Act could be stated. \n  Plaintiffs did not seek, and the court did not rule on whether, the plaintiffs had met their burden under Code of Civil Procedure \nsection 382. \n \n10 \nEstablishing adequacy of representation is an element of the community of interest requirement. ( Lockheed Martin, supra, 29 \n \nCal.4th at 1104.) \n \n11  If this argument had any validity, it would apply equally to the plaintiffs, themselves. There are 16 individual plaintiffs, who \n  constitute .24 % of the class, yet they purport to speak for the entire class. Also, plaintiffs’ math is wrong - 11 is .14% of 7775; not \nless than . %. \n \n12  Section 4704 defines “service agency” as “any developmental center or regional center that receives state funds to provide services \n  to persons with developmental disabilities.” \n \n13  Ramos differs from this case in another important respect. In Ramos, each class members right to AFDC benefits depended upon \n  the resolution of one essential issue - the legality of the work requirement. Here a separate set of issues and facts must be decided \nfor each class member in order to determine whether he/she is unlawfully institutionalized. \n \n14  Furthermore, the number of putative class members or their conservators who actually contend that they are wrongfully \n  institutionalized is unknown. \n \n \n27 \n \n\n \n \nCAPITOL PEOPLE FIRST, et al., Appellants, v...., 2006 WL 3907584...   \n \n \n   \n \n \n28 \n ",
