    "summary": "<p>On August 27, 1998, plaintiff, an advocacy group, filed this lawsuit under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 on behalf of persons with mobility impairments eligible for housing assistance from the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA).  This action was filed against the PHA in the Philadelphia Division of the United States Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff, ADAPT of Philadelphia, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that PHA was violating the Rehabilitation Act.  Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that by not making enough units available in the PHA system handicap-accessible, the PHA, as a recipient of federal funds ran afoul of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p><p>PHA administers public housing benefits in the City of Philadelphia through being a direct provider of housing, as well as issuing Section 8 'vouchers' for low-rent housing.   The total capacity at the time of filing was 20,000 units. 13,000 of those units were in 'high-rise' buildings. 7,000 were in 'scattered-site' buildings which were built into rowhouse-like blocs adjacent to one another. Plaintiffs alleged that there were not enough accessible scattered-site units.</p><p>PHA received block grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for renovation and modernization from 1993 to 1997. Before renovations, PHA had no mobility-impaired accessible scattered-site units. After renovations, PHA only had 22 accessible units. Accessible units for persons with mobility impairments represented only 2.7% of the scattered-site units.</p><p>Implementing regulations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require that if renovations take place in a structure, and the renovation costs 75% or more of the replacement cost of the unit, then 5% of the renovated housing must be \"made accessible for people with mobility impairments.\" 24 C.F.R. § 8.22(b). </p><p>On April 14, 2000, following a non-jury trial, the Court (Judge Harvey Bartle III) entered partial findings of fact to assist the parties in reaching a settlement agreement.  The Court found that PHA was covered by the HUD regulation and was required to make 5% of its scattered-site units accessible to people with mobility impairments, and that furthermore, that the cost of such alterations was not prohibitively expensive. </p><p>On May 20, 2002, the parties entered into a private settlement agreement , which was filed under seal. The entire document is not currently available, so the duration and exact contents of the PHA's obligations under the settlement agreement are unknown at this time. The contents of the settlement agreement are detailed in later litigation to enforce the settlement agreement.</p><p>Under the Settlement Agreement, the PHA was required to construct 248 units accessible to persons with mobility impairments by December 2005 (with 124 to be available in December 2003). The Settlement Agreement also stipulated the locations of the accessible units, with a proviso that if the PHA decided to construct the units elsewhere, it would seek the Plaintiff's approval, which would be given or denied within 15 days of notice.  </p><p>Plaintiffs rejected several 'off-settlement' unit proposals in the \"Tasker Homes\" because plaintiffs believed they were in conventional buildings and not scattered-site units. The PHA sued to enforce the settlement agreement, alleging the Plaintiff's approval was unreasonably withheld. The Court found in the PHA's favor and certified the \"Tasker Homes\" as satisfying the PHA's obligations under the settlement agreement.</p><p>On June 8, 2004, the Court again approved another batch of the \"Tasker Homes\" as satisfying the PHA's settlement obligations after the Court found that the Plaintiffs approval was unreasonably withheld.</p><p>On August 29, 2005, the Court entered an Order following an evidentiary hearing on yet another alleged violation of the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs claimed that the PHA was not taking steps to \"maximize use\" of accessible scattered-site units, in contravention of the Settlement Agreement. The Resident Advisory Board (RAB) moved to intervene as a defendant. The motion was granted, and the RAB presented testimony that the occupants of the units in question were disabled, but not dependent on wheelchairs for mobility.  The Court found violations, but found that they were moot, and encouraged the Plaintiffs to be vigilant in ensuring compliance with the Settlement Agreement.</p><p>During the course of the evidentiary hearing, the PHA filed several interlocutory appeals contesting discovery orders entered by the District Court.  </p><p>On January 9, 2006, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Roth, Fuentes, and Garth), in a published opinion authored by Judge Garth (433 F.3d 353) found that the litigation was piecemeal and that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The Court vacated the appeal.</p><p>On May 11, 2006, The plaintiffs informed the District Court in a letter that the PHA had complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. </p><p>On May 15, 2007, the District Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees as untimely. There has been no litigation following the entry of this order.</p>",

August 29, 2005\nThe court has before it the motion of plaintiffs to\nenforce a Settlement Agreement between the parties.  In addition,\ndefendants have moved to enforce the Settlement Agreement, or, in\nthe alternative to vacate it.  After an extended discovery period\nand much acrimony, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the\nalleged violations.\nI.\nPlaintiffs ADAPT of Philadelphia (\"ADAPT\"), Liberty\nResources, Inc. (\"LRI\"), and several individuals instituted this\naction some seven years ago against the Philadelphia Housing\nAuthority and its director Carl Greene (collectively \"PHA\") for\nviolations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794, and certain regulations which implement § 504, including\n24 C.F.R. §§ 8.23, 8.24, and 8.26, for their failure to provide a\nsufficient number of public scattered-site housing units\naccessible to persons with mobility impairments.  Plaintiffs\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief.  After a non-jury trial\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 2 of 59\nin December, 1999 in which we found in favor of plaintiffs and\nwhile the matter was on appeal, the parties finally entered into\na Settlement Agreement which was approved by the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and then by this court on\nMay 20, 2002.  The Settlement Agreement provided that PHA would\nmake available certain scattered-site housing units for the\nmobility impaired in accordance with an enunciated timetable. \nThe court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.1\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, PHA was to create 248\n\"accessible public housing rental units (which may include\nrentals with sale options for resident households including a\nperson with a mobility impairment),\" at least 124 of which were\nto be \"accessible and otherwise ready for occupancy no later than\nDecember 31, 2003.\"  Settlement Agreement § B at 3.  These units\nwere to be in addition to the five percent accessibility\nrequirement under 24 C.F.R. Part 8.\nThe Settlement Agreement, among other things, requires\nthat PHA \"take reasonable non-discriminatory steps to maximize\nutilization of such units by eligible households that include an\nindividual whose disability requires the accessibility features\nof the particular unit, in accordance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.27.\" \nSettlement Agreement § C at 8.  Section 8.27 provides:\nOccupancy of accessible dwelling units.\n1.  Section G of the Settlement Agreement states:  \"[i]f the\nparties are not able to resolve any dispute, either party may\nseek judicial relief by motion submitted to the Court.\"\n-2-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 3 of 59\n(a)  Owners and managers of multifamily\nhousing projects having accessible units\nshall adopt suitable means to assure\nthat information regarding the\navailability of accessible units reaches\neligible individuals with handicaps, and\nshall take reasonable nondiscriminatory\nsteps to maximize the utilization of\nsuch units by eligible individuals whose\ndisability requires the accessibility\nfeatures of the particular unit.  To\nthis end, when an accessible unit\nbecomes vacant, the owner or manager\nbefore offering such units to a non-\nhandicapped applicant shall offer such\nunit:\n(1)  First, to a current occupant of\nanother unit of the same project,\nor comparable projects under common\ncontrol, having handicaps requiring\nthe accessibility features of the\nvacant unit and occupying a unit\nnot having such features, or, if no\nsuch occupant exists, then\n(2)  Second, to an eligible qualified\napplicant on the waiting list\nhaving a handicap requiring the\naccessibility features of the\nvacant unit.\n(b)  When offering an accessible unit to an\napplicant not having handicaps requiring\nthe accessibility features of the unit,\nthe owner or manager may require the\napplicant to agree (and may incorporate\nthis agreement in the lease) to move to\na non-accessible unit when available.\n24 C.F.R. § 8.27.  Nowhere in the Settlement Agreement is the\nterm \"mobility impairments\" specifically defined.  \nSection P of the Settlement Agreement provides that\n\"[e]very four months, PHA shall provide Plaintiffs with a report\n(with a copy to the Court) regarding the implementation and\nstatus of Paragraph B, Accessible Units, above, and upon\n-3-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 4 of 59\nreasonable request by counsel for Plaintiffs or PHA, counsel\nshall meet to discuss the report.\" \nAfter the December 31, 2003 deadline had passed,\nplaintiffs sought confirmation from PHA that the first group of\naccessible units was ready for occupancy.  Counsel for PHA\nresponded at the end of January, 2004 that 149 units had been\ncompleted but that \"cosmetic finishing is still required on a\nhandful of units.\"  In a letter of March, 2004, PHA counsel wrote\nthat 37 units still required cosmetic finishing and 68 units were\nnot yet occupied. \nOn May 10, 2004, pursuant to a motion by plaintiffs,\nthe court ordered PHA to identify the locations of accessible\nunits constructed under the Settlement Agreement and to furnish a\n\"statement identifying which of these units are not leased to\nhouseholds that have a person with a mobility disability that\nrequires the accessibility features.\"  Plaintiffs' counsel\nthereafter visited a number of these units.  As a result of this\nassessment, plaintiffs filed the instant motion on July 6, 2004\nto enforce the Settlement Agreement on the ground that between 43\nand 53 units identified as accessible had not been leased to\nhouseholds with occupants who required the accessibility\nfeatures.  Specifically, plaintiffs contended that the occupants\nof these units do not require wheelchairs or the additional\nmaneuvering space provided to accommodate wheelchairs in the\nscattered site units.  Plaintiffs alleged that as of the time\ntheir motion was filed 17 units were still unoccupied, 25 were\n-4-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 5 of 59\nnot occupied with a person having a disability requiring the\naccessible features, one address did not exist, and 10 were\n\"uncertain.\"  Plaintiffs also asserted that PHA's delay of more\nthan seven months in filling some of these units with appropriate\nresidents amounted to non-compliance with the Settlement\nAgreement.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  On\nAugust 10, 2004, the court allowed the Resident Advisory Board\n(\"RAB\") to intervene in this action on behalf of residents living\nin PHA housing.  \nAs a result of discovery, plaintiffs shifted their\nposition somewhat, and by the end of the hearing they were\nchallenging the eligibility of residents in 36 accessible units. \nThey also continued to assert that some units, although now\noccupied, were not available for occupancy by the December 31,\n2003 deadline set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  Six of the\n36 challenged units are managed by PHA staff, and the rest are\nmanaged by alternative management entities (\"AMEs\"), which\noperate as leasing agents for PHA at several of the housing sites\nunder the Settlement Agreement.  Each AME has entered into a\nregulatory and operating agreement with PHA requiring the AME to\noperate in accordance with all applicable public housing\nregulations. \nAt the recent hearing on their motion to enforce,\nplaintiffs presented the testimony of architect Robert Thomas, an\nexpert in architectural design and cost issues for accessible\nhousing, including accessibility under the Uniform Federal\n-5-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 6 of 59\nAccessibility Standards (\"UFAS\").  Generally, Mr. Thomas'\ntestimony focused on the ease of adding some accessible features\nto existing public housing.  These standards were created\npursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4151 et\nseq., and were adopted by HUD in 24 C.F.R. Part 40.  Cheryl T.\nWest, a physical therapist who performs home assessments for\npersons with disabilities, also testified as an expert for\nplaintiffs.  Ms. West's opinion was that most of the residents in\nthe contested units did not require all the accessible features. \nDefendants called as a witness Robert S. Ardinger, an expert in\ndisability accessibility and accommodations.  Ms. Margaret B.\nFahringer, the Accessibility Coordinator for PHA, also testified\nfor PHA.  Intervenor RAB presented the expert testimony of Dr.\nDavid A. Lenrow, a physician in the field of rehabilitation\nmedicine.  His testimony emphasized that one must consider the\ntotality of the circumstances in deciding whether a person needed\nthe features of an accessible unit.\nAlthough it was initially anticipated that the\nresidents of the disputed units would be called as witnesses, the\nparties stipulated that written statements by those residents\nwould be admissible in lieu of courtroom testimony.  It was also\nstipulated that the disabled resident of each disputed unit would\nhave testified that he or she \"was personally interviewed by a\nrepresentative of his [or her] landlord prior to placement in\naccessible housing.\"\n-6-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 7 of 59\nII.\nThe central issue before us is whether PHA has violated\nthat provision of the Settlement Agreement which requires it to\n\"take reasonable nondiscriminatory steps to maximize the\nutilization of such units by eligible individuals whose\ndisability requires the accessibility features of the particular\nunit in accordance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.27.\"\nUnder Pennsylvania law, enforceability of a settlement\nagreement is governed by principles of contract law.  See Cambria\nv. Ass'n of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO, No. Civ.A. 03-5605, 2005\nWL 821082, *1 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 5, 2005).  The burden of proof is on\nthe party attempting to enforce the settlement agreement.  Id. \nThe party seeking to demonstrate the breach must do so by a\npreponderance of the evidence.  See Mountbatten Surety Co. v.\nJenkins, No. Civ.A. 02-8421, 2004 WL 2297405, *6 (E.D. Pa. Oct.\n13, 2004) (citing Raganar Benson, Inc. v. Bethel Mart Assocs.,\n454 A.2d 599, 602 (Pa. Super. 1981)).\nIII.\nIn order to apply for public housing under the aegis of\nthe PHA, applicants complete and return a \"pre-application\" or\n\"admissions application.\"  These pre-applications are used by PHA\nin compiling a city-wide waiting list.2  When the applicant\nreaches the top of the waiting list, PHA contacts that person and\ninvites him or her, as \"head of household,\" to come in for a\n2.  This list is separate from the \"Section 8\" housing waiting\nlist.  Section 8 provides a subsidy to lease private housing.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 8 of 59\n\"screening\" interview.  At that interview, the PHA application\nreview specialist confirms information and helps complete the\n\"application\" or \"application packet.\"  PHA gathers information\nabout the applicant's income, credit standing, and criminal\nhistory, if any.  If the applicant qualifies for public housing,\nhe or she is offered a public housing lease, when available. \nThis offer sometimes takes place on \"home selection day,\" where\napplicants get three days to select a unit from a list.  \nFor all PHA sites, applicants are asked, beginning with\nthe pre-application, whether anyone in the household uses a\nwheelchair or otherwise has a disability.  The applicant may\nprovide more information as to any disability by completing a\n\"Notice of Disability Accommodation,\" also called an\naccommodation request form (\"notice\").3  This form may be\ncompleted at the screening interview.  When accessible units,4 or\nunits in compliance with UFAS, become available, PHA is required\npursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 8.27(a) to \"jump\" down the waiting list\n3.  The Notice of Disability Accommodation form asks:  whether\nany household member uses a wheelchair or has a mobility\nimpairment; whether the applicant requests an \"accessible unit\n(wheelchair),\" a \"mobility impaired unit, describe needs,\"\n\"special features/needs\" [includes space to describe, if\napplicant desires], hearing impaired unit, or vision impaired\nunit; grab bars; handheld shower; tub seat; raised toilet seat;\nor grab bar(s) at toilet.\n4.  As set forth in UFAS, \"accessible\" means a unit is located on\nan accessible route, or a continuous unobstructed path connecting\naccessible elements and spaces and complying with the space and\nreach requirements of UFAS, and can be approached, entered, and\nused by individuals with handicaps.  24 C.F.R. § 8.3. \n-8-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 9 of 59\nto find tenants who may require the accessibility features.  This\npractice is also called \"mining\" the waiting list.  \nAs part of the screening process for applicants who\nhave requested accommodations for disabilities, PHA uses a third\nparty \"Verification of Need for Disability Accommodation\" form\n(\"verification\") to ensure the requests are legitimate.5  The \n5.  The verification, signed under penalty of perjury, asks:\n1.   Is the applicant disabled?\n2.

They are given training regarding the\nNotice/Accommodation Request Form and third-party disability\n6.   We note that § 100.202 \"does not prohibit\" inquiries, when\nmade to all applicants regardless of whether they have a\nhandicap, to determine \"whether an applicant is qualified for a\ndwelling available only to persons with handicaps or to persons\nwith a particular type of handicap,\" and \"whether an applicant\nfor a dwelling is qualified for a priority available to persons\nwith handicaps or to persons with a particular type of handicap.\" \n24 C.F.R. §§ 100.202(c)(2)&(3).  Further, the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") Accessibility\nNotices state \"PHA may verify a person's disability ... to the\nextent necessary to ensure that applicants are qualified for the\nhousing to which they are applying ... [and] may require\ndocumentation of the manifestation of the disability that causes\na need for specific accommodation or accessible unit.\"\n-11-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 12 of 59\nverification, transfer applications, and lease riders.7  They are\ntrained on interviewing persons seeking accessible units and on\ndata entry for applicants requesting accessible units and are\ninstructed that illegible or incomprehensible forms must be\nclarified.  Ex. D235.  Although PHA's application review\nspecialists do not seek diagnoses or information regarding the\nextent of an applicant's disability, they seek information about\nthe manifestation of the disability and what accessible features\nare needed.\nAlthough it is \"not required,\" PHA \"would like\" all\nheads of household who move into an accessible unit to sign a\nlease rider or lease addendum, whether or not the person has a\ndisability.  The lease riders provide that if there is no\ndisabled resident in the household, the leaseholder agrees to\nmove upon request of PHA or the AME.\nAs noted above, PHA uses AMEs as leasing agents at\nseveral of the sites counted under the Settlement Agreement\nrather than undertaking the leasing itself.  Each AME also\nprocesses applications for public housing separately and\ndistinctly from the PHA processing, and each is responsible for\nselecting residents and maintaining its own \"site-based waiting\nlist.\"  As is true for the PHA process, applicants submit a pre-\napplication to an AME, but this pre-application is AME-site-\n7.  A non-disabled resident who is assigned an accessible unit is\nasked to sign a lease rider, agreeing to move if a mobility\nimpaired applicant is found.\n-12-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 13 of 59\nspecific.  To address the requirements that the units be leased\nto persons needing the particular features, AMEs utilize the\nnotice and verification forms, described above, in the\napplication process.\nAME staff members are trained by PHA in how they should\nfill accessible units.  PHA retained Mullin & Lonergan Compliance\n(\"M&L\"), a consulting firm with expertise in the requirements of\nthe Fair Housing Act and other similar regulations, to train AME\nstaff on compliance with § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nAdditionally, there is one-on-one training by PHA of new AME\nemployees.  In 2002, PHA and M&L conducted training for the four\noutside companies that run the AMEs:  Pennrose Management,\nInterstate Realty, The Community Builders, and the Philadelphia\nAsset & Property Management Corporation.  This training covered\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, occupation of accessible units,\noutreach to the members of the disabled community, and procedures\nfor compliance with HUD regulations.  Management at each site was\ninformed the site was required to maintain a waiting list of\napplicants who required any kind of mobility-impaired unit.  Also\ndistributed at the AME training was a document entitled \"Section\n504 Compliance and Accessible Units.\"  This document explained\nPHA's policies about what questions may be asked.  It also noted\nthat all applicants should be given the notice of disability\naccommodations form, that AMEs should conduct yearly outreach to\ndisabled individuals, that site-based waiting lists should be\nmaintained and may be \"mined,\" and that all non-disabled\n-13-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 14 of 59\nresidents in accessible units should sign lease riders agreeing\nto move if a mobility impaired applicant is found.\nPHA instructs the AMEs to conduct outreach in order to\nmaintain a well-balanced applicant pool that is separate and\ndistinct from the general PHA waiting list.  As cited by\ndefendants, § 5A of the Housing Act of 1937 permits public\nhousing authorities to maintain site-based waiting lists as long\nas they specify they will do so in their annual plans, which are\napproved by HUD.  42 U.S.C. § 1437c-1(d)(3).  PHA's contractual\nrelationship with each of the AMEs provides for site-based\nwaiting lists and these contracts are approved by HUD.\nPHA retains control over the AMEs, at least with\nrespect to the implementation of the Settlement Agreement.  In at\nleast one instance, PHA directed an AME located at the ML King\nsite to move tenants from an accessible unit who did not qualify\nfor the unit under 24 C.F.R. § 8.27.  \nSeventy-five out of 149 of the existing settlement\nunits are managed by PHA.  In its efforts to fill the accessible\nunits subject to the Settlement Agreement, PHA first offered them\nto current occupants of other units in the same projects or\ncomparable projects under PHA control whom PHA determined had\ndisabilities requiring the accessibility features of the new\nunits and were occupying units without such features.  See 24\nC.F.R. § 8.27.  Unfilled units were then offered to applicants on\nthe waiting list whom PHA had determined had disabilities\nrequiring the features of the new units and who had been\n-14-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 15 of 59\ndetermined to qualify for public housing.  Id.  As noted above,\non at least one occasion, PHA did require an AME to remove an\nimproperly placed household from an accessible unit.\nPHA began taking steps in approximately October, 2001,\nprior to the signing of the Settlement Agreement, to fill the\nsettlement units.  It began by reviewing its list of residents\nwho had requested accommodations requiring transfers to\naccessible units (\"transfer list\").  In addition, the PHA\nAccessibility Coordinator kept what she called a \"working list\"\nof people who had requested transfers and had either gone through\nthe formal transfer screening process or who had informed her\nthat they intended to do so.  The working list tracked requests\nfor the type of unit and location within the city.  The working\nlist was also used to track paperwork and to coordinate with\nhousing managers.  Before it could transfer a household on the\ntransfer or working lists, PHA often had to re-certify the\nhousehold because of some change in status, such as a child\nreaching the age of majority or the acquisition of a live-in\naide.\nOnce the paperwork was completed, PHA would match the\nhouseholds to settlement units with a suitable number of\nbedrooms.  At that point, Ms. Fahringer and Ms. Denise Faulk of\nPHA's Admissions Department began to \"pencil-in\" or assign\nfamilies into settlement units using a spreadsheet.  This\nspreadsheet came into use as early as February, 2003 and was\nupdated at weekly meetings between Ms. Fahringer and Ms. Faulk.\n-15-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 16 of 59\nEmergency situations required transferring some\nhouseholds into settlement units out of order, pursuant to § 8.27\nand PHA Policy Governing Admissions and Continued Occupancy.\nBecause PHA would soon have a large number of\naccessible units, it also looked to new applicants.  Concurrent\nwith its search through the transfer and working lists, it began\nsearching its existing waiting list for families requiring\naccessible housing.  Beyond its existing lists, PHA conducted\noutreach consisting of mailings to between 40 and 70 disabled\nhousing outreach groups.\nApplicants on the waiting list who had requested\naccessible units were coded in the computer system as \"M1\"\napplicants.  PHA's first search in early 2003 found approximately\n350 applicants who were coded as M1.  Prior to 2002, the only\npre-application question pertaining to mobility impairments asked\nabout wheelchair use, so nearly all of the applicants found in\nthis search had claimed to have a family member who used a\nwheelchair.  \nThe first pool of applicants was sent letters informing\nthem that they were at the top of the waiting list.  Each\nreceived the full application and another notice of disability\naccommodation form.  PHA then called applicants in for\ninterviews.  Each contested PHA resident was personally\ninterviewed by a PHA staff member before a lease was extended as\nconfirmed by a stipulation entered into among counsel. \nApplicants who did not actually need accessible units were\n-16-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 17 of 59\ndropped from the list.  For applicants who remained eligible for\naccessible housing, PHA mailed a medical verification form to\ntheir medical providers.\nMost of the third-party verifications for PHA housing\ncompleted by applicants' medical providers in these early stages\nwere reviewed by Ms. Fahringer during her weekly meetings with\nMs. Faulk.  In any case, when the application process including\nthe interview had been completed, the head of admissions or other\nsupervisory-level staff member had to approve the housing\napplicant's eligibility for accessible housing.  This approval\nwas given only after a review of the following information in the\napplicant's file:  application stating there was a disabled\nfamily member; documents showing the disabled individual received\nSSI or SSDI; medical verification form and other medical\ninformation on file; and information on the applicant's\ndisability information (\"DI\") screen in PHA's computer system. \nAt times, additional information gathered from social workers,\nnurses, live-in aides, doctors, and other care-givers was also\nconsidered.\nIn its evidence and argument to the court, PHA uses the\nphrase \"snapshot in time.\"  It contends that its decision to\nplace any particular family into an accessible unit was an\nattempt to make a reasonable accommodation for a specific\nindividual in a non-discriminatory manner using the housing stock\navailable at a particular point in time.  Applicants were pulled\nfrom the waiting list and offered units in the order they had\n-17-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 18 of 59\napplied.  PHA made its determination based on whether or not an\nindividual was eligible for an accessible unit but did not\ncompare applicants' disabilities to one another.\nNot all applicants decided to take the units that were\noffered to them.  In those cases, PHA continued to work its way\ndown the waiting list.  In one case, eleven applicants rejected a\nparticular unit.  Applicants decide to reject units for a variety\nof reasons, such as unit size or location.  Each rejection, of\ncourse, delays the occupancy of the unit.\nSeventy-four of the existing 149 settlement units are\nmanaged by AMEs.  The AMEs followed procedures similar to those\nof PHA.  The first AME settlement units were ready for occupancy\nin October, 2003.  Beginning in March and April of 2003, the AMEs\nbegan their outreach efforts, which consisted of:  mailings\ndirectly to individuals on PHA's transfer and waiting lists and\nto disabled housing advocacy groups; open houses to which\ndisabled housing advocacy groups were invited to bring their\nconstituents; newspaper advertisements; advertisements on signs\nat the individual AME sites; a shopping mall kiosk; and direct\nmailings to particular zip codes.  A typical mailing to advocacy\ngroups included information regarding the availability of\naccessible units.  Interested individuals were told they should\napply directly to the AME site with an enclosed application.  One\nAME mailed notices to persons on PHA's waiting list that its site\nwould be accepting applications.  At least one AME site manager\n-18-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 19 of 59\ncontacted Ms. Fahringer when an accessible unit became available,\nallowing PHA to conduct outreach on behalf of the AME site.\nThe AMEs also used their site-based waiting lists to\nfind applicants who claimed a family member with a mobility\ndisability.  AME site managers personally interviewed the head of\nhousehold for every applicant placed in a settlement unit.  In\nall but one case, the head of household was also the disabled\nindividual.  Additionally, Ms. Fahringer was available to the\nsite managers for questions regarding whether an applicant was\nappropriate for a particular unit.  Each decision to fill an AME\nsettlement unit was reviewed by Ms. Fahringer within four months\nafter the decision was made.  As previously stated, in the case\nof one AME, Ms. Fahringer discovered a non-disabled household had\nbeen placed in settlement units and instructed the site to remove\nthe household and place mobility impaired persons in the units.\nIV.\nAs stated above, plaintiffs currently contest 36\nhouseholds which they contend do not include an individual whose\ndisability requires the accessability features of the unit.  Six\nof these units are managed by PHA and the rest by AMEs.\n-19-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 20 of 59\nA.

PHA notes state\n\"had limp, young person, very heavy.\"  \nL.W.'s statement says L.W. applied to return to the\nCambridge development when it was rebuilt and asked for a home\nwith no steps to accommodate L.W.'s disability.  L.W. has severe\ndegenerative joint disease and obesity, which affect L.W.'s\nability to walk.  L.W. cannot use steps because L.W.'s knees give\nout and cause L.W. to fall.  The arthritis is worst in L.W.'s\nknees and back, and L.W. also has carpal tunnel of the hands. \nL.W. was essentially trapped in a previous second floor apartment\nafter suffering a fall down the stairs there.  All of the one-\nlevel residences at Cambridge have \"handicap features.\"\nB.W. - 1416 Clearview Street #H210\nB.W.'s verification states B.W. has a long-term\nphysical disability that requires accessible housing features or\naccommodations.  All three unit types are circled, but none of\nthe accessible unit features is.  Bathroom features are\nrequested.  The handwritten notes are illegible.  There is a\nDecember, 2004 letter from B.W.'s physician describing her\nincreasing left-sided weakness, difficulty walking, and\noccasional falling.  The letter advises against B.W. moving at\nthat time.  B.W.'s disability accommodation request states \"no\nsteps, can't walk to car without cane ________ doctor will\nconfirm need for caregiver.\"  There is a March, 2005 follow-up\nsummary by B.W.'s physician which states B.W. may have a \"focal\nlesion between lower brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord\"\n-45-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 46 of 59\nand \"vestibular cerebellum.\"  B.W. has imbalance, left leg\nweakness, and a hand tremor. \nB.W.'s personal statement affirms that B.W. had a\nstroke in 1999 and sustained permanent damage to the left side of\nher body, impairing her ability to walk.  B.W. needs a three-\npronged cane to walk and to get up from a seated position.  B.W.\nmust drag her left foot and her gait is unstable.  She falls\nfrequently and has sustained injuries.  She cannot reach\noverhead.  B.W. also has glaucoma and vision problems, which\ncontribute to her difficulty walking.  B.W. relies on the lowered\ncabinets and closet rods and needs to sit at the lowered counters\nto prepare meals.  The bathroom features are also necessary for\nB.W. to be able to take care of her needs.\nS.N. - 1322A Bainbridge Street\nS.N.'s verification states S.N. has a long-term\nphysical disability that requires accessible housing features or\naccommodations.  The disability is expected to last for 12\nmonths, and states that S.N. needs a unit on one level.  The\nmedical provider also stated that S.N. needs bathroom grab bars.\nG.A. - 918 Poplar Street\nG.A.'s verification explains that G.A. has a long-term\nphysical disability and needs a unit on one level and bathroom\ngrab bars.  The medical provider's handwritten notes, to the\nextent they can be deciphered, read \"walks with cane.\"  G.A.'s\nnotice states a household member uses a wheelchair and has a\nmobility impairment.  The notice requests a wheelchair unit and\n-46-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 47 of 59\nbathroom accommodations.  PHA notes state \"disabled - yes, 1st\nfloor - G[rab]B[ars] med doc, CANE, he asked W[heel]C[hair]\nunit.\"\nV.\nAs is obvious, many of the verifications described\nabove have internal inconsistencies that are not resolved in the\nrecords of PHA or the AMEs, PHA's leasing agents.  Furthermore,\nthere are sometimes critical omissions.  It is apparent that\nfrequently medical providers either did not spend sufficient time\nin filling out the verifications carefully or did not understand\nthe forms or their purpose.  In addition, the personal interviews\nby PHA and its leasing agents are not always fully described.  In\nsum, the documentation to support the placement of some occupants\ninto the units in question is clearly inadequate.  Nonetheless,\nrecently prepared personal statements of the residents which have\nbeen introduced into evidence in lieu of their testimony fill in\nthe gaps and make up for those inexcusable deficiencies.\nWith all the heated rhetoric in this action, we must\nnot lose sight of the narrow issue before us.  Our job here is\nnot to reform the PHA, however compelling a goal that may be.\nAgain, our focus is on whether PHA has violated § C of the\nSettlement Agreement which, as noted, provides:  \"PHA shall take\nreasonable non-discriminatory steps to maximize the utilization\nof such units by eligible households that include an individual\nwhose disability requires the accessibility features of the\nparticular unit, in accordance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.27.\"  It is a\n-47-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 48 of 59\nfact specific inquiry.  Plaintiffs take the position that the 36\ncontested units do not house individuals who meet the criteria of\n§ 8.27.  Plaintiffs contend that the individuals in question,\nwhile concededly suffering from some physical handicaps, do not\nuse wheelchairs or do not otherwise need the wider maneuvering\nspaces which these units provide.  Plaintiffs reference the\nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (\"UFAS\"), which are\narchitectural requirements for units for the disabled.  24 C.F.R.\nPart 40, App. A.  These standards, among other things, require\nunits to have features such as wider interior dimensions that\nmake the units accessible to persons using wheelchairs.  They\nalso provide for grab bars and other accommodations in bathrooms,\nkitchen cabinets and counters, and electrical outlets at lower\nheights than for the non-disabled.  The UFAS standards eliminate\nall steps.  Plaintiffs would have us read into § 8.27 the\nrequirement that a person must need the wheelchair features of an\naccessible unit in order to be eligible to occupy it.\nIt is important to emphasize that § 8.27 makes no\nreference to UFAS.  UFAS, we reiterate, delineates the\narchitectural standards for accessible units, while § 8.27 deals\nwith the occupancy of those units.  UFAS provides for the general\ndesign of structures so they can accommodate persons with a full\nrange of disabilities, including those using wheelchairs.  It is\nimperative that these units are built to accommodate wheelchairs\namong other needs since it is difficult, if not impossible, to\nmodify non-accessible units for wheelchairs after they have been\n-48-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 49 of 59\nconstructed.  However, the UFAS standards are not intended to\nregulate who among a group of disabled persons should be assigned\nto live in a particular accessible unit or who among any group of\ndisabled persons should receive priority.\nSection 8.27 says nothing about wheelchairs.  It\nprovides that owners and managers such as PHA \"shall take\nreasonable non-discriminatory steps to maximize the utilization\nof such units by eligible individuals whose disability requires\nthe accessibility features of the particular unit.\"  It does not\nlimit occupancy of accessible units only to wheelchair users or\nto persons who would need all the units' features, and after our\nexamination of the foregoing residents' records and statements,\nit is easy to see why.  The hearing before this court has\ndemonstrated the variation and indeed the uniqueness of each\ndisabled resident's medical and physical condition.  The authors\nof § 8.27 wisely have not attempted to draft a regulation which\nseeks to describe with bright line exactitude who is and who is\nnot eligible for accessible units, or who among those who are\neligible has a more compelling case than someone else.  It is\nessential for any decision to be made based on evaluation of the\nindividual applicant under the totality of the circumstances. \nDrawing a bright line in favor of wheelchair users or those who\nneed the wider spaces to move about would be overly simplistic\nand would exclude innumerable other equally appropriate\nindividuals from housing available pursuant to § 8.27.  The\nwording of § 8.27 obviously shows an appreciation for the vast\n-49-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 50 of 59\narray of mobility and other impairments and the inability to\nanticipate or encompass every possible situation in a regulation. \nWe will not read a wheelchair or similar requirement into § 8.27\nor impose a specific number or percentage of features that an\noccupant must utilize in order to qualify for a unit.  Again, the\nrule of reason and non-discrimination is the touchstone of this\nregulation.\nFor example, E.H. does not use a wheelchair, but\nclearly needs a unit with accessible features.  E.H. lives at\n2326 N. 13th Street, has had three strokes and has a major\nseizure disorder which causes six different kinds of seizures. \nE.H. has had brain surgery, has diabetes and asthma, and is deaf\nin one ear.  E.H. has severe knee and hip arthritis and horrible\npain in the hips and back.  Both knees have been replaced.  E.H.\nhas a history of falling and has been told that another fall\ncould cause paralysis.\nAnother example is L.C., who also does not use a\nwheelchair.  She lives at 744 A South 13th Street.  L.C. has\ncancer of the lungs, larynx, and tonsil, and her voice box has\nbeen removed, preventing her from talking.  She has an open hole\nin her throat and shortness of breath.  L.C. also has severe back\npain, for which she is heavily medicated.  L.C. has extreme\ndifficulty walking and cannot use steps.  She also needs other\nfeatures of the accessible unit.\nFinally, there is V.H. who lives at 814A N. 11th\nStreet.  Again, she does not use a wheelchair.  She cannot climb\n-50-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 51 of 59\nstairs unless someone lifts her badly deteriorated legs for her. \nShe usually uses a walker, but sometimes uses a cane in the\nhouse.  V.H. has emphysema, high cholesterol, and high blood\npressure.  Her right arm is semi-paralyzed and she is on pain\nmedications for her arthritis.  V.H. falls a lot and cannot get\nup by herself after falling, but she does not want to be in a\nwheelchair.  She too needs an accessible unit.\nMore people are seeking public housing than PHA has\nhousing stock.  There are also more applicants with disabilities\nthan there are public housing units with accessible features. \nAvailability of units changes from day to day as do the physical\nconditions of persons on the waiting lists.  Circumstances do not\nremains static.  PHA aptly describes its decisions as being made\nin \"a snapshot in time.\"  Trying to match particular disabled\nindividuals and their families with particular vacant units at\nany particular point in time is a complex matter.  PHA and its\nleasing agents must verify current financial eligibility as well\nas criminal history.  They must consider the nature of the\ndisability, accessibility features needed and family size, as\nwell as the features and size of the available unit.  Their\nefforts are further complicated by the fact that applicants\nsometimes reject a unit because of location or for other reasons. \nThe condition of the unit and the need to transfer persons from\none public housing unit to another due to demolition or to\nemergencies are further considerations.  One can easily\n-51-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 52 of 59\nappreciate the maze of difficulties PHA and its leasing agents\nface in making placement decisions.\nWe recognize that some of the accessibility features,\nsuch as grab bars in the bathrooms, can be added to non-\naccessible units so as to accommodate a person with disabilities. \nPHA has made such modifications in some cases.  However, there\ncannot be a hard and fast rule to require such additions or\nmodifications in every case.  First, an otherwise appropriate\nnon-accessible unit may not be available for modification at the\nexact time an accessible unit is available and needed.  It may,\nfor example, be in a location at a significant distance from\nhealth care providers or family members who help with a person's\ncare or may be inconvenient to public transportation.  It may\nneed repairs which cannot be made immediately.  We cannot dictate\nthat a person is never eligible for an accessible unit simply\nbecause a non-accessible unit somewhere in the PHA system could\nbe modified to accommodate that person.  Again, we must look at\nthe totality of the circumstances and apply a reasonableness\ntest.\nPHA and its leasing agents must necessarily make\njudgment calls about the need for an accessible unit based on the\nmedical and other information including availability.  It is not\nan exact science.  They must make placements in chronological\norder.  They cannot pass over an eligible individual simply\nbecause they may believe that someone down the waiting list may\nbe more deserving.  They must move as quickly as possible so that\n-52-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 53 of 59\nunits do remain vacant for as short a time as necessary.  Again,\nthey act in the real world with all its complications in a\n\"snapshot in time.\"  While the efforts, procedures, and oversight\nof PHA and its leasing agents have not always been optimal and\ntheir record keeping has often been inadequate, we find and\nconclude that plaintiffs have not proven that any of the\noccupants of the 36 units has been placed there in violation of\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Section 8.27 requires PHA to take\n\"reasonable nondiscriminatory steps to maximize the utilization\nof such units by eligible individuals.\"  Each person residing in\nthe units in issue has a disability or disabilities which\n\"require the accessibility features of the particular unit\" in\nwhich he or she is living.  Virtually all the disabled occupants\ncannot negotiate steps, and all need at least some accessible\nfeatures.  Keeping in mind the totality of the circumstances\nincluding the serious medical and physical conditions and the\nhousing needs of the occupants of the 36 units in issue, we\ncannot say PHA or its leasing agents have acted unreasonably in\ncarrying out their regulatory or contractual mandate.  \nFor the court to try to delineate in an order exactly\nwhat medical and physical conditions and other circumstances\nentitle an applicant to scattered site accessible public housing\nand who should have priority among eligible persons would require\nus to micromanage eligibility decisions and to act as a \"super-\nPHA.\"  This is neither required nor authorized under the\n-53-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 54 of 59\nSettlement Agreement or § 8.27 under the present facts.9 \nUnfortunately, there are simply not enough units to accommodate\nall the disabled applicants for public housing.  This\ninsufficiency is at the root of the problem, but it will not be\nsolved by granting the type of procrustean relief sought by\nplaintiffs.\nWe must also address the steps PHA has taken with\nregard to the issue of the timeliness with which PHA created the\nsettlement units, readied them for occupancy, and leased them. \nThe Settlement Agreement directs that \"at least 124 units shall\nbe accessible and otherwise ready for occupancy no later than\nDecember 31, 2003 (\"Phase I\").\"  Settlement Agreement § B. \n\"Ready for occupancy\" is not defined in the Settlement Agreement.\nAlthough the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and\nInspections (\"L&I\") had issued certificates of occupancy for 149\nsettlement units prior to December 31, 2003, PHA sent plaintiffs\na letter on March 4, 2004 stating that 37 of the settlement units\nstill required \"cosmetic finishing\" which was expected to be\ncompleted by the end of that month.  Issues such as thresholds\nthat needed replacing or concrete pads that had to be re-poured\nto make them flush with entries still existed because PHA was\nhaving \"problems getting the contractor to perform.\"  Further,\n9.  We note also that plaintiffs would not have the ability to\nbring this action today under the Rehabilitation Act to enforce\nHUD regulations.  See Three Rivers Ctr. for Indep. Living, Inc.\nv. Hous. Auth. of City of Pittsburgh, 382 F.3d 412, 425 (3d Cir.\n2004).\n-54-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 55 of 59\nPHA encountered problems with vandalism and fires.  Plaintiffs\ncontend that no more than 75 settlement units were actually\noccupied prior to December 31, 2003.\nWe agree with PHA that actual occupancy is not the\nmeasuring stick for compliance with the \"ready for occupancy\"\nprovision of the settlement.  However, it is clear that many of\nthe units were not ready for occupancy by the deadlines as\nrequired under the Settlement Agreement.  We find that PHA\nviolated the December 31, 2003 deadline for not having all 149 of\nthe settlement units \"ready for occupancy\" by that time. \nNonetheless, the motion to enforce was not filed for many months\nafter the deadline, and it is now almost two years later.  All of\nthese units have long since been available for leasing.  The\nmatter is now moot.  We trust that the next group of scattered\nsite accessible settlement units will actually be made \"ready for\noccupancy\" by December 31, 2005 as called for under the\nSettlement Agreement.  PHA should take whatever steps are\nnecessary to ensure that there are no \"cosmetic changes\" or other\nobstacles remaining to be fixed in these units after this\nupcoming deadline.  If these units are not ready by that date,\nnothing herein precludes plaintiffs from promptly seeking the aid\nof the court.\nWe turn to the issue of the long vacancies that\nsometimes occurred after a unit was ready for occupancy.  PHA\nargues that it uses the same efforts to fill the settlement\nhousing as it does its other housing and that \"[i]t is not\n-55-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 56 of 59\nunusual for rental housing in Philadelphia to remain vacant for\nmore than six months between tenants.\"  Post-Hearing Br. of Defs.\nat 99.  PHA points out that up to 13 percent of PHA housing\ngenerally is vacant at one time.  Id.  Some units are turned down\nby successive applicants before they are accepted, and that this\ncreates delay.  Moreover, when an occupant dies and the death\neliminates eligibility of the household to remain living in a\nunit, the PHA allows a period of bereavement before eviction.  It\nmust also make repairs and paint a unit after it becomes vacant.\nWe have great concerns that as much as 13 percent of\npublic housing units sit vacant for up to six months when the\nneed is so compelling.  Yet, due to the lack of a developed\nrecord on this point, we cannot say that PHA has acted\nunreasonably.  All we can do is to encourage PHA to act as\nspeedily as reasonably possible to reduce the vacancy periods. \nDecember 31, 2005 is rapidly approaching, and we fervently hope\nthat PHA is already taking steps to match appropriate applicants\nwith this next wave of accessible settlement housing.\nWe further recommend that PHA direct the AME sites to\nlook to the PHA disability waiting list if and when the AME sites\nhave no disabled applicants on their own lists.  While the AMEs\nmay be permitted by HUD to use site-based waiting lists, our\nconcern is with the occupancy of the settlement units.  We can\nthink of no reason why the AMEs should not consider disabled\napplicants on the PHA waiting list to supplement their own lists. \nMoreover, going forward, we urge PHA to inform all applicants and\n-56-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 57 of 59\ntenants who claim a need for accessible housing that settlement\nunits exist at both PHA and AME sites.\nPlaintiffs also challenge PHA's designation of a\nlimited number of accessible settlement housing for the elderly\nonly.  In our view, this designation is not unreasonable.  There\nare certainly elderly persons who need units with accessible\nfeatures, as this record has demonstrated.  Nothing in the\nSettlement Agreement before us prevents this designation.\nFor all the above reasons, we will deny the motion of\nplaintiffs to enforce the Settlement Agreement.\nWe now address the motion of PHA to enforce the\nSettlement Agreement or alternatively to vacate it.  PHA contends\nthat plaintiffs' conduct has been inconsistent with its terms. \nWe disagree.  Plaintiffs have sought simply to gain information\nthrough discovery and to take action to ensure compliance with\nthe Settlement Agreement.  There is no basis to grant PHA's \nmotion to enforce.\nFinally, PHA argues that there was a mutual mistake by\nthe parties when they entered into the Settlement Agreement.  It\nseeks rescission.  Mutual mistake exists where the parties were\nmistaken as to an existing material fact at the time their\ncontract was executed.  Consol. Rail Corp. v. Portlight, Inc.,\n188 F.3d 93, 96 (3d Cir. 1999).  Among other requirements, the\nmistake must relate to the basis of the agreement and must\nmaterially affect the parties' performance.  Id.  This argument\nis without merit and requires no extended discussion.\n-57-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 58 of 59\nAccordingly, we will also deny PHA's motion to enforce.\n-58-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 300   Filed 08/29/05   Page 59 of 59\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nADAPT OF PHILADELPHIA, et al. : CIVIL ACTION\n:\nv. :\n:\nPHILADELPHIA HOUSING AUTHORITY, :\net al. : NO. 98-4609\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 29th day of August, 2005, based on the\ncourt's findings and conclusion of law set forth in the\naccompanying Memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n(1)  the motion of plaintiffs ADAPT of Philadelphia,\nLiberty Resources, Inc., Marie Watson, Marshall Watson, and Diane\nHughes to enforce the Settlement Agreement (Doc. #152) is DENIED;\nand\n(2)  the motion of defendants Philadelphia Housing\nAuthority and Carl Greene to enforce the Settlement Agreement or,\nin the alternative, to vacate the Settlement Agreement (Doc.\n#157) is DENIED.\nBY THE COURT:\n/s/ Harvey Bartle III         \nJ.",

The threshold question we must answer is whether entry of final judgment — the\nDistrict Court's August 29, 2005 order — now provides appellate jurisdiction over these\notherwise premature appeals from interlocutory discovery orders. Concluding that the\norders from which the instant appeals were taken are not final and appealable orders,\nnotwithstanding the subsequent entry of final judgment, we dismiss the appeals for want\nof appellate jurisdiction.\nI.\nA.\n6 ADAPT of Philadelphia, Liberty Resources, Inc., and several individuals (collectively,\n\"ADAPT\") commenced this action against the Philadelphia Housing Authority and its\nexecutive director Carl Greene (collectively, \"PHA\"), alleging that PHA had not made\navailable a sufficient number of subsidized accessible housing units for persons with\nmobility impairments, in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §\n794, and the implementing regulations thereunder.1  ADAPT prevailed after a bench trial\nin the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. PHA appealed,\nbut before this Court heard the matter, the parties entered into the Agreement, thereby\nresolving all outstanding issues in the litigation. The District Court approved the\nAgreement on May 20, 2002, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Agreement.\n7 Paragraph B of the Agreement required PHA to \"create 248 accessible public housing\nrental units,\" with 124 to be ready for occupancy no later than December 31, 2003 and the\nremaining units to be ready for occupancy no later than December 31, 2005. These units\nwere required \"in addition to units PHA is otherwise required to make accessible in\naccordance with 24 C.F.R. Part 8 (including its 5% accessibility requirements).\"2\n8 Paragraph C of the Agreement required PHA to \"take reasonable non­discriminatory\nsteps to maximize the utilization of [the units created under Paragraph B] by eligible\nhouseholds that include an individual whose disability requires the accessibility features of\nthe particular unit, in accordance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.27.\" Section 8.27 requires owners or\nmanagers of multifamily housing projects to inform eligible individuals of the availability\nof accessible units and to give priority to disabled applicants. See 28 C.F.R. § 8.27.\n9 Paragraph P of the Agreement, entitled \"Reporting and Monitoring,\" required PHA to\nquarterly \"provide [ADAPT] with a report . . . regarding the implementation and status of\nParagraph B, Accessible Units.\" The Agreement also granted both PHA and ADAPT the\nright to seek judicial relief by motion to the District Court in the event of a dispute over\nenforcement of the Agreement.\n10 After the December 31, 2003 deadline had passed, ADAPT sought confirmation from\nPHA that the first group of accessible units had been made available in accordance with the\nAgreement. To this end, ADAPT first sought discovery of the addresses of the accessible\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 2/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\nunits which PHA claimed fulfilled its obligations under Paragraph B of the Agreement.\nAfter successfully obtaining the relevant addresses, ADAPT visited a number of these units\nand determined that several units identified as \"accessible\" had not been leased to tenants\nwho required the various accessibility features. As a result, ADAPT filed a motion to\nenforce the Agreement, alleging that while PHA had created the accessible housing units\nconsistent with the terms of the Agreement, it nonetheless violated Paragraph C of the\nAgreement by failing to lease a significant number of the units to tenants with mobility\nimpairments.\n11 In connection with its motion to enforce, ADAPT filed a series of additional motions,\nseeking to obtain in discovery the medical verifications of the tenants residing in those\nunits. During these discovery disputes, Resident Advisory Board, Inc. (\"RAB\"), a non­\nprofit organization advocating on behalf of residents of tax­subsidized housing,\nintervened in the action, aiming to protect the privacy interests of the affected tenants.\n12 As we discuss below, the District Court issued five discovery orders during the course of\nthe settlement enforcement proceeding, dated as follows: (1) May 10, 2004, (2) September\n3, 2004, (3) November 24, 2004, (4) February 10, 2005, and (5) March 15, 2005.3  PHA\ncomplied with all orders and produced all documents and information. PHA and RAB have\nfiled nine separate appeals from the five discovery orders. Three of those appeals, taken\nfrom the May 10, 2004 and September 3, 2004 orders, have already been dismissed for\nwant of appellate jurisdiction.4  See Adapt of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth.,\n417 F.3d 390 (3d Cir.2005) (\"Adapt I\") (holding that the orders were not final and\nappealable orders). Thus, six appeals remain pending, and it is those appeals which invoke\nour jurisdiction here.\n13 In order to determine our jurisdiction over the instant appeals, it is necessary to\ndescribe the contents and rulings of the District Court's orders which gave rise to each\nappeal. In addition, to put the present appeals in the appropriate jurisdictional\nperspective, we are obliged to visit once again the three appeals (arising from the May 10,\n2004 and September 3, 2004 orders) which had been dismissed earlier by a separate\npanel of this court for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nB.\nThe May 10, 2004 Order\n14 On January 29, 2004, PHA notified ADAPT that it had met the December 31, 2003\ndeadline under Paragraph B of the Agreement. PHA, however, did not provide the\naddresses of the accessible units which it claimed fulfilled its obligations under that\nParagraph. When ADAPT sought those addresses in order to verify compliance with the\nAgreement, PHA refused. ADAPT thereupon filed a discovery motion, styled as a \"motion\nto compel\" disclosure of the addresses in the District Court. PHA opposed the discovery\nmotion, arguing that the Agreement did not require identification of addresses.\n15 On May 10, 2004, the District Court granted ADAPT's motion and entered an order\nrequiring PHA to identify the street addresses of the accessible units created in accordance\nwith the terms of the Agreement. It also required PHA to provide a \"statement identifying\nwhich of these units are not leased to households that have a person with a mobility\ndisability that requires accessibility features.\" PHA moved for reconsideration and a stay\nin the District Court, both of which were denied.\n16 ADAPT's counsel thereafter visited a number of these units, seeking to ascertain\nwhether or not the units were occupied by tenants with mobility impairments. As stated in\ntwo declarations submitted by ADAPT in connection with its motion to enforce the\nAgreement, ADAPT's counsel \"looked in windows\" and \"spoke to neighbors\" to verify\nthese facts. As a result of this assessment, ADAPT filed its motion to enforce the\nAgreement, arguing that a number of units identified as accessible had not been leased to\nhouseholds with occupants who required the accessibility features. ADAPT sought\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 3/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.\n17 Meanwhile, PHA did not seek a stay with this Court, but instead complied with the May\n10, 2004 order and filed an appeal. As stated, that appeal — No. 04­2595 — was dismissed\non jurisdictional grounds in Adapt I. See Adapt I, 417 F.3d at 396.\nThe September 3, 2004 Order\n18 PHA's opposition to ADAPT's first motion to compel disclosure of the addresses was a\nharbinger of things to come. ADAPT filed two more \"motions to compel\" in the District\nCourt based on PHA's alleged failure to comply with its obligations under Paragraph B of\nthe Agreement. In the first of those motions, ADAPT sought the street addresses of each\naccessible residence created pursuant to Paragraph B at the Mount Olivet and Suffolk\nManor public housing projects. In 2003, after the parties had entered into the Agreement,\nPHA asked for ADAPT's consent to substitute units at Mount Olivet and Suffolk Manor for\nunits that PHA had previously identified and agreed to. ADAPT agreed to these\nsubstitutions, which formed the basis of its motion to compel.\n19 In its second motion, ADAPT sought the street addresses of each residence that PHA\nhad made accessible at various public housing projects in accordance with the\nrequirements of 24 C.F.R. Part 8. See supra note 2. Because PHA agreed under the\nAgreement to construct 248 accessible units in excess of its statutory obligations under the\nfive percent accessibility requirement, ADAPT sought confirmation that these statutorily\nrequired units had in fact been made available.\n20 In response, PHA filed a motion to enforce the Agreement, or, in the alternative, to\nvacate the Agreement. PHA argued that ADAPT, in demanding individualized oversight of\nPHA's tenant decisions, was seeking to impose terms that PHA had refused to furnish\nthrough negotiations leading to the Agreement. According to PHA, it was required to\nproduce no more information than that required by Paragraph P of the Agreement, which,\nas previously noted, required PHA to report quarterly \"regarding the implementation and\nstatus of Paragraph B Accessible Units.\" Additionally, PHA argued that ADAPT, in\ndemanding information respecting the units constructed in accordance with 24 C.F.R. Part\n8 (the 5% accessibility requirement), was seeking relief outside the scope of the\nAgreement, which did not concern nor involve 24 C.F.R. Part 8.\n21 Sometime thereafter, RAB intervened, claiming that the requested disclosures would\nviolate the privacy rights of the residents living in the subject units. The District Court,\nhowever, granted both of ADAPT's motions on September 3, 2004. After unsuccessfully\nseeking a stay in the District Court, PHA complied with the order, turning over the\nrelevant information.\n22 PHA then appealed, arguing that the ordered disclosures were beyond the scope of the\nAgreement. RAB separately appealed, arguing that the ordered disclosures violated the\ntenants' privacy rights. Together with the appeal from the May 10, 2004 order (No. 04­\n2595), both appeals — No. 04­3651(PHA) and No. 04­3686(RAB) — were dismissed on\njurisdictional grounds in Adapt I. See Adapt I, 417 F.3d at 396.\n23 The remaining three discovery orders — the District Court's orders dated November 24,\n2004, February 10, 2005, and March 15, 2005, which are the focus of the instant\nconsolidated six appeals — concern certain medical information about the tenants of the\naccessible public housing units. We describe those orders below.\nThe November 24, 2004 Order\n24 ADAPT next sought discovery from PHA concerning the medical and physical conditions\nof the disabled occupants of the units constructed for the mobility impaired in accordance\nwith the Agreement. In particular, ADAPT requested copies of the verifications of mobility\nimpairment relied upon by PHA in making tenant placements for the accessible housing\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 4/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\nunits. To this end, ADAPT served certain interrogatories and requests for production of\ndocuments on PHA. In response, PHA served timely objections and moved for a protective\norder. RAB also moved the District Court for a protective order, contending that the\ndisclosure sought by ADAPT violated the privacy rights of the affected tenants. ADAPT\nthen moved to compel PHA to answer the interrogatories and produce the requested\ndocuments.\n25 As noted above, PHA requires verifications of mobility impairment, which are usually\ncompleted by physicians, before accepting tenants for accessible housing units. The\nverification form consists of a series of \"yes\" or \"no\" questions asking whether the\nindividual seeking public housing requires certain accessibility features for the mobility\nimpaired — i.e., wider doors, lowered sinks and counter tops, and grab bars. Question No.\n5 of the verification form also asks the physician or reporting individual the following:\nPlease provide further information that would assist us to determine the accessible\nhousing features and/or accommodations in housing required by the applicant (i.e.,\nfeatures to accommodate devices and equipment used by the applicant, particular needs\nnot addressed by the features listed above, etc.). We do not require details or information\nabout the nature or extent of the disability.\n26 On November 24, 2004, the District Court granted in part and denied in part RAB's\nmotion for a protective order.5  The District Court ordered PHA to produce the medical\nverifications for the residents of each of the units in question. The District Court also\nordered that the \"verifications produced shall have the residents' names redacted and shall\nbe identifiable by the resident's [sic] initials, unit address, and date residency\ncommenced.\" As an additional privacy protection, the District Court ordered that \"counsel\nfor plaintiffs . . . shall not disclose the information contained in the medical verifications to\nanyone other than their outside experts, who must agree in advance and in writing to keep\nthe information in confidence pending further order of the court.\"\n27 In compliance with the District Court's order, PHA produced the redacted medical\ninformation. PHA (No. 04­4734) and RAB (No. 04­4502) appealed.\nThe February 10, 2005 Order\n28 Based on the redacted verifications produced pursuant to the November 24, 2004\norder, ADAPT determined that 59 residents did not \"require the accessibility features\" of\nthe particular units. Accordingly, ADAPT filed a motion to compel further disclosures\nlimited to these 59 units. Specifically, ADAPT moved the District Court to compel PHA to\nproduce unredacted copies of the same verifications.\n29 On February 10, 2005, the District Court ordered PHA to produce the medical\nverifications for 59 of the 149 units subject to the November 24, 2004 order with only the\nresidents' names redacted — the answers to Question 5 (requiring accessibility features)\nfor the 59 residents \"otherwise shall not be redacted.\" The District Court again required\nthe verifications to be filed under seal and in accordance with the same confidentiality\nterms.\n30 In compliance with the court order, PHA produced the unredacted verifications. PHA\n(No. 05­1727) and RAB (05­1692) then appealed.\nThe March 15, 2005 Order\n31 In its March 15, 2005 order, the District Court ordered PHA to produce the unredacted\ndocuments for five additional units, as well as a chart drawn up by PHA's expert witness.\nAs in the previous discovery orders, the names of the residents were redacted and\ndisclosure was limited to ADAPT's counsel and experts. PHA (No. 05­2080) and RAB (05­\n2079) appealed.\nC.\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 5/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\nThe August 29, 2005 Order (Denying Enforcement of the Agreement)\n32 On August 29, 2005, after all the foregoing nine appeals had been filed and after the\nthree appeals in Adapt I had been dismissed, the District Court entered its final judgment\ndenying all motions to enforce the Agreement. In a thorough opinion, the District Court\nexamined each of the challenged units6  to determine whether PHA had violated\nParagraph C of the Agreement, which required rental to disabled tenants. The District\nCourt considered the following documentation: medical verifications, statements of\npersonal interviews conducted by PHA, and personal statements of the residents\nintroduced into evidence in lieu of their testimony.\n33 In effect, ADAPT had contended that the individuals in question, while suffering from\nsome physical handicaps, did not require the use of wheelchairs and thus did not need the\naccessibility features of the particular units. The District Court, refusing to read a\nwheelchair or similar requirement into the Agreement and declining to establish a rigid\nhierarchy among eligible disabled persons, concluded that PHA, in placing the individuals\nin question, had acted reasonably and in conformity with its obligations under the\nAgreement. Noting that the placement of disabled persons in the subject units was not \"an\nexact science,\" the District Court stated that ADAPT's position would require the court to\n\"micromanage eligibility decisions and to act as a `super­PHA.'\"\n34 Accordingly, the District Court denied ADAPT's motion to enforce the Agreement. In\ndoing so, the District Court also denied PHA's motion to enforce the Agreement, finding\nthat ADAPT merely sought to gain information through discovery to ensure compliance\nwith the Agreement.\nII.\n35 As a result of the judgment by this court dismissing the three earlier appeals, see Adapt\nI, 417 F.3d at 396, we are left with the following appeals to review: 04­4734(PHA), 04­\n4502(RAB), 05­1727(PHA), 05­1692(RAB), 05­2080(PHA), and 05­2079(RAB). All six\nappeals concern the compelled disclosure of medical verifications. At issue is whether we\nhave appellate jurisdiction over these appeals.\n36 With exceptions not relevant here, we may only hear appeals from final judgments of\nthe district courts. See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.7  Discovery orders are not final decisions within\nthe meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291. See, e.g., Smith v. BIC Corp., 869 F.2d 194, 198 (3d\nCir.1989); Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 785 F.2d 1108, 1116 (3d Cir.1986) (\"Discovery\norders, being interlocutory, are not normally appealable.\"); New York v. U.S. Metals\nRefining Co., 771 F.2d 796 (3d Cir.1985). In certain limited circumstances, however,\ndiscovery orders may be reviewed pursuant to the collateral order doctrine of Cohen v.\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), which\nprovides a narrow exception to the general rule permitting appellate review only of final\norders.\n« up\n37 PHA initially argued in its appellate brief that appellate jurisdiction lies under the\ncollateral order doctrine.8  PHA now argues that with the entry of final judgment — the\nAugust 29, 2005 order, we have acquired appellate jurisdiction over these six consolidated\nappeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Contending that entry of the August 29, 2005 order\nconverted the interlocutory orders from which these premature appeals were taken into\nfinal orders, PHA seeks to distinguish Adapt I from the instant appeals.\n38 PHA argues that at the time we dismissed the appeals in Adapt I, no final judgment had\nyet to be entered by the District Court. As a result, finality had not attached to the\ndiscovery orders that had been appealed. PHA now claims that, with the filing of the\nAugust 29, 2005 order, any problems of finality affecting the instant six appeals have been\ncured. In so arguing, PHA relies on a number of precedents from our court, including two\ndecisions in particular: Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, 698 F.2d 179 (3d Cir.1983), and\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html

353\nLazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., 166 F.3d 581 (3d Cir.1999). There, we essentially held that the\npremature appeals in those cases had become effective upon entry of final judgment.\n39 ADAPT, on the other hand, argues that we have no jurisdiction over the six appeals,\nrelying on the Supreme Court's decision in FirsTier Mortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage\nIns. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 111 S.Ct. 648, 112 L.Ed.2d 743 (1991).9  In that case, the Supreme\nCourt construed the specific appellate rule governing premature appeals — Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2) — and held, in unequivocal terms, \"that Rule 4(a)(2) [does\nnot] permit[] a notice of appeal from a clearly interlocutory decision — such as a discovery\nruling or a sanction order under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—to serve\nas a notice of appeal from the final judgment.\" See FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 276, 111 S.Ct. 648\n(emphasis added). ADAPT contends that under FirsTier, the instant appeals suffer from\nthe same problems of finality as the three appeals dismissed in Adapt I.\n40 These six appeals now require us to determine whether discovery orders and other\nsimilar interlocutory orders, if followed by entry of final judgment, qualify as premature\nappeals that may ripen upon entry of judgment.10  We hold that they do not. Accordingly,\nwe are without jurisdiction to reach the merits of the appeals. See Firestone Tire & Rubber\nCo. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 379, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981).\nIII.\nA.\n41 Our decision in Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, 698 F.2d 179 (3d Cir.1983), provides\nthe analytical point of departure for examining the appealability of the six instant appeals.\nIn Cape May Greene, this court held that a premature notice of appeal, filed after\ndisposition of some of the claims before a district court, but before entry of final\njudgment, will ripen upon the court's disposal of the remaining claims. See id. at 184­85.\nThere, the district court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of\nthe defendants. The plaintiff thereupon filed a notice of appeal from the district court's\norder granting summary judgment. However, the defendants had filed a cross­claim,\nwhich had not been adjudicated at the time the notice of appeal was filed. As a result, the\njudgment of the district court was not final. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).11  This court upheld\nits jurisdiction to review the grant of summary judgment against the plaintiff. It did so\nbecause the cross­claim, although not disposed of before the notice of appeal was filed,\nwas adjudicated after the notice of appeal was filed, thereby achieving finality as to all\nclaims. Id. at 184.\n42 The so­called Cape May Greene rule — and its expansive view of appellate jurisdiction\n— has been reaffirmed by this court on multiple occasions.12  Some courts of appeals,\nhowever, have not adhered to such a rule. See, e.g., United States v. Hansen, 795 F.2d 35,\n37­38 (7th Cir.1986) (discussing circuit split on the issue and rejecting Cape May Greene\nrule).\n43 Still other courts of appeals that have followed a rule similar to Cape May Greene have\nrestricted finality in premature cases in light of the Supreme Court's decision in FirsTier,\nwhich, as discussed below, called into question broader understandings of when\npremature appeals may ripen upon entry of final judgment. See Outlaw v. Airtech Air\nConditioning and Heating, Inc., 412 F.3d 156, 160 (D.C.Cir.2005) (\"We agree with\ndecisions concluding that those prior lines of precedent must be limited in light of\nFirsTier.\"); United States v. Cooper, 135 F.3d 960, 963 (5th Cir.1998) (\"[W]e recognize\nthat in light of FirsTier, this expansive view of appellate jurisdiction cannot survive\");\nSerine v. Peterson, 989 F.2d 371, 372 (9th Cir.1993).\n44 But while other jurisdictions have narrowed their holdings involving premature appeals\nin light of FirsTier, we have declined thus far to do the same, holding that the Cape May\nGreene rule has not been overruled by FirsTier. See Lazy Oil, 166 F.3d at 587. We begin\nour analysis with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (\"FRAP\") 4(a)(2).\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 7/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\nB.\n45 FRAP 4(a)(2), as construed by the Supreme Court, allows certain qualifying premature\nappeals to become effective upon entry of final judgment, thus preserving those appeals\nfrom dismissal for failure to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite of finality. FRAP 4(a)(2)\nprovides that \"[a] notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or order—but\nbefore the entry of the judgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of and after the\nentry.\" In FirsTier, the Supreme Court held that FRAP 4(a)(2) \"permits a notice of appeal\nfrom a nonfinal decision to operate as a notice of appeal from the final judgment only\nwhen a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately\nfollowed by the entry of judgment.\" 498 U.S. at 276, 111 S.Ct. 648.\n46 FirsTier involved a notice of appeal that was filed after the district judge announced\nfrom the bench that he was granting summary judgment on all claims, but before the court\nentered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Supreme Court concluded that FRAP\n4(a)(2) operated to make the premature appeal effective after the subsequent entry of\nfinal judgment. As the Court explained, FRAP 4(a)(2) \"was intended to protect the\nunskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but\nmistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the\nactual final judgment.\" Id. In such cases, the Court further explained, \"a litigant's\nconfusion is understandable, and permitting the notice of appeal to become effective when\njudgment is entered does not catch the appellee by surprise.\" Id.\n47 The Court contrasted those situations \"from a clearly interlocutory decision­such as a\ndiscovery ruling or a sanction under Rule 11,\" because a \"belief that such a decision is a\nfinal judgment would not be reasonable.\" Id. Hence, the Court concluded that \"Rule 4(a)\n(2) [does not] permit[] a notice of appeal from a clearly interlocutory decision — such as a\ndiscovery ruling or a sanction order under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n—to serve as a notice of appeal from the final judgment.\" Id. (emphasis added). We have\nheld, however, that there are situations other than those covered by FRAP 4(a)(2) when a\npremature notice of appeal will ripen at a later date. See Lazy Oil, 166 F.3d at 587.\nC.\n48 In Lazy Oil, the precedent on which PHA most heavily relies, we reaffirmed the validity\nof the Cape May Greene doctrine, holding that Cape May Greene had not been overruled\nby FirsTier. Lazy Oil involved an appeal that had been taken from an order of the district\ncourt approving a class action settlement and denying various objectors' motions.\nHowever, in that same order, the district court denied a motion to approve an allocation\nplan for the settlement proceeds. Directly after the order had been entered, objectors filed\na notice of appeal. Two months later, the district court approved a revised allocation plan.\nFinal judgment was then entered and the case closed. Id. at 585.\n49 The question posed in Lazy Oil was \"whether a notice of appeal, filed . . . after a district\ncourt's order approving a class action settlement but before the court enters a final\njudgment approving all aspects (including the allocation) of the settlement, ripens upon\nthe district court's entry of final judgment or is premature and void.\" Id. The Lazy Oil\ncourt exercised jurisdiction over the premature notice of appeal, relying on Cape May\nGreene and holding that our earlier precedents, including Cape May Greene, were not\noverruled by FirsTier. Id. at 586. The court acknowledged \"that Rule 4(a)(2) does not\nsupport the Cape May Greene doctrine when the order from which a notice of appeal is\nfiled is not one that would be final if followed immediately by entry of judgment.\" Id.\nHowever, the court determined that the Cape May Greene rule remained viable because\nFirsTier simply limited the reach of Rule 4(a)(2)'s proviso. Id. at 587. In this court's view, \"\n[FirsTier] did not hold that the Rule 4(a)(2) situation — announcement of a final decision\nfollowed by notice of appeal and then entry of the judgment — is the only situation in\nwhich a premature notice of appeal will ripen at a later date.\" Id.\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html 8/11\n\n6/11/12 433 F.3d 353\nD.\n50 Conceptually speaking, Lazy Oil construed the Cape May Greene rule as broader than\nthe limitations established by FirsTier, thus encompassing more situations than those\nstrictly controlled by FRAP 4(a)(2). Our cases now hold that premature appeals may ripen\nupon entry of final judgment pursuant to two distinct jurisdictional doctrines: (1) the Cape\nMay Greene rule and (2) Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2).13  FRAP 4(a)(2), as\nconstrued in FirsTier, cannot save the present premature appeals, which have their roots\nin discovery orders. See FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 276, 111 S.Ct. 648. That narrows our focus to\nwhether the present appeals can be saved pursuant to the Cape May Greene and Lazy Oil\ndoctrine, which makes no distinction between unalterably interlocutory (discovery) orders\nand orders that would be final upon entry of judgment.\n51 Our decision in Lazorko v. Pennsylvania Hosp., 237 F.3d 242 (3d Cir.2000), is\ninstructive here. In Lazorko, we held that there was no jurisdiction over an appeal from an\naward of sanctions where the district court had yet to quantify the amount of the sanction\nbefore the notice of appeal was filed. Although the district court subsequently entered its\nfinal order on the sanctions award before we heard the appeal, we held that the entry of\nthe final order did not cure the premature appeal and render it timely. In so holding,\nLazorko cited to FirsTier; it did not cite to Cape May Greene or Lazy Oil. Id. at 248.\n52 The present case bears far more similarity to Lazorko than to Cape May Greene or Lazy\nOil. We take pains in emphasizing that none of the cases following Cape May Greene, Lazy\nOil included, involved discovery or similar interlocutory orders. See supra note 12.\nMoreover, as stated in Lazy Oil, the Cape May Greene rule applies where the refusal to\nexercise jurisdiction would elevate a mere technicality above important substantive issues.\nSee Lazy Oil Co., 166 F.3d at 587. That is not the situation here. To the contrary, these\nappeals raise compelling concerns about piecemeal litigation. As we explained in Adapt I:\n53 [T]hese appeals [from discovery orders] are stark examples of why Congress, through\n28 U.S.C. § 1291, has expressed a distaste for piecemeal litigation. PHA has disputed\nseveral issues resolved by the District Court and, without regard for whether they are final\nor whether there exists any exception to the finality rule, seem to have filed a\ncorresponding appeal for each. As a result, this case is being litigated on appeal piece by\npiece, from order to order, seriatim. . . . Litigating cases in this manner is undesirable for\nseveral reasons. It creates delay; it adds to the costs and efforts that must be expended by\nboth the parties and the courts; and, as is prevalent in this case, it diminishes the\ncoherence of the proceedings.\n54 Adapt I, 417 F.3d at 396. As such, the assertion of appellate jurisdiction in the case sub\njudice would do more than overcome a mere technicality — it would invite the very\npiecemeal litigation discouraged by 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n55 Perhaps more importantly, Lazy Oil noted \"that Rule 4(a)(2) does not support the Cape\nMay Greene doctrine when the order from which a notice of appeal is filed is not one that\nwould be final if followed immediately by entry of judgment.\" Lazy Oil Co., 166 F.3d at\n586. That is the precise situation presented by these appeals. Therefore, whatever the\ncontinued viability of Lazy Oil may be, see supra note 13, it cannot control interlocutory\norders such as the discovery orders found here or the sanctions order of the nature found\nin Lazorko.\nIV.\n56 Concluding that the Cape May Greene and Lazy Oil rule is not applicable to discovery or\nsimilar interlocutory orders, we hold that appeals from discovery orders do not qualify as\npremature appeals that may ripen upon entry of final judgment. Accordingly, the six\ninstant appeals, no different from the appeals dismissed in Adapt I, must be dismissed for\nlack of appellate jurisdiction.14\nbulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/433/433.F3d.353.04-4502.04-4734.05-2080.05-1692.05-2079.html

June   , 2004\nBefore the court is a motion of the Philadelphia\nHousing Authority (\"PHA\") to approve certain Phase II units\npursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Release (\"Settlement\nAgreement\") entered into between the plaintiffs and the PHA to\nprovide accessible low income scattered site housing for the\nmobility impaired.  The plaintiffs oppose the motion.\nThis litigation has had a long and tortured history,\nfilled with some very contentious chapters.  At the core of\nplaintiffs' case was the position that the housing for mobility\nimpaired should be spread out among and fully integrated with\nthat for the rest of society.\nThe settlement agreement between the parties provided\nfor a certain number of accessible units to be dispersed\nthroughout the City of Philadelphia.  The housing was to be made\navailable in several phases.  While the Settlement Agreement\nidentified various locations for the accessible housing, it also\nprovided \"[w]ith plaintiffs' consent, which shall not\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 147   Filed 06/08/04   Page 2 of 4\nunreasonably be withheld, PHA may substitute different units for\nany of the units identified above, on a one-for-one basis.\"  If\nthe plaintiffs do not agree to the substitution, the Settlement\nAgreement allowed PHA to seek relief from the court.  PHA is now\nseeking such relief.\nPHA proposes to substitute seven additional townhouses\nand four apartments in a development known as the Tasker Homes in\nplace of units identified in the Settlement Agreement.  The\nTasker Homes consists of 245 rental units which are currently\nbeing constructed.  Of these, 173 will be townhouses.  The\nremaining seventy-two units will be located in a three story\nbuilding for the elderly and near elderly.  This development in\nSouth Philadelphia will cover a six block area bounded by Morris\nStreet, New Hope Street, 21st Street, 29th Street, and Vare\nAvenue.  Under federal law, independent of the Settlement\nAgreement involved here, nine townhouses or 5% of the 173 units\nmust be made accessible to the mobility impaired.  See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 8.22.\nPlaintiffs oppose the substitutions PHA seeks on the\nground that they are concentrated in a small area and thus do not\nconstitute scattered site units.  Plaintiffs also point to prior\nsubstitutions of similarly concentrated housing to which they\nhave agreed in the spirit of compromise and cooperation. \nPlaintiffs are now drawing a line in the sand.\nAfter review of the record, including the photographs\nand descriptions of the Tasker Homes, as well as the obstacles\n-2-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 147   Filed 06/08/04   Page 3 of 4\nwhich PHA faces in implementing the Settlement Agreement, we will\ngrant PHA's motion in part.  We will permit PHA to substitute\nfour townhouses which will bring the total number of townhouses\naccessible to the handicapped at the Tasker Homes to 7.5% of the\ntotal.  We find that this limited substitution fits within the\nconcept of scattered site housing, considering the size of Tasker\nHomes and the fact that it is spread over six blocks.  Similarly,\nwe will allow PHA to substitute three units in the seventy-two\nunit apartment building.  Any further concentration of accessible\nlow income housing for the mobility impaired in the Tasker Homes\nwould defeat the scattered site principle.\nFinally, we note that this ruling is based on the\nparticular facts before us and should not be construed by either\nplaintiffs or PHA as a precedent for the future.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 147   Filed 06/08/04   Page 4 of 4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nADAPT OF PHILADELPHIA, et al. : CIVIL ACTION\n:\nv. :\n:\nPHILADELPHIA HOUSING AUTHORITY, :\net al. : NO. 98-4609\nORDER\nAND NOW, this        day of June, 2004, for the reasons\nset forth in the accompany Memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n(1)  the motion of PHA to approve Phase II Units is\nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part; and\n(2)  PHA may substitute four townhouses for three\napartments only in the development known as Tasker Homes in place\nof units identified in the Settlement Agreement and Release.\nBY THE COURT:\n______________________________\nJ.",

PHA requested plaintiffs' approval of these units nearly seven months \nago, only to have that approval withheld without justification.  There is simply no reason to \nreject beautiful new accessible units in South Philadelphia, and PHA requests that the Court \nexercise its authority to allow them to count towards its Phase II Settlement Agreement \nobligations.i \nTo the extent it would be helpful, PHA would be happy to show the proposed units to the \nCourt and plaintiffs' counsel. \nDSB:96434i.2/PHI223-i46638 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 137   Filed 04/23/04   Page 4 of 9\nFACTS \nAs this Court is aware, in January 2002, the parties to this litigation entered into a \nSettlement Agreement pursuant to which PHA agreed to construct 248 accessible public housing \nunits by December 2005.  See Settlement Agreement, Section A page 3, a true and correct copy \nof which is attached as Exhibit A.  The Agreement provides that PHA was to have constructed \n124 accessible units by December 31, 2003 (\"Phase I\"), and the remaining 124 by December 31, \n2005 (\"Phase II\").  By the Phase I deadline, PHA had gone beyond its obligations under the \nSettlement Agreement and created 149 accessible units.  See letter of Abbe F. Fletman to \nStephen Gold dated January 29,2004, a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit B. \nIn satisfying its obligations under the Settlement Agreement, PHA may offer different \nunits than those specified in the Agreement.  Plaintiffs may not unreasonably disapprove newly \noffered units.  The Agreement states: \nAll 248 of the accessible units ... created by PHA pursuant to this Settlement \nAgreement shall comply with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards \n(\"UFA  S\").  With Plaintiffs' consent, which shall not unreasonably be withheld, \nPHA may substitute different units for any of the units identified above, on a one \nfor -one basis. \nSettlement Agreement, Section B, page 7.  In the event that PHA offers different units than those \nidentified in the Settlement Agreement, \"it shall provide Plaintiffs' counsel ... written \nnotice ....\"   Id.  Plaintiffs have 15 days to agree or disagree with PHA's proposed substitution; \nfailure to disagree constitutes agreement.  Id. \nIn a letter dated September 29,2003, PHA first requested plaintiffs' consent to include 11 \nunits at Tasker Homes as part of Phase II.  A true and correct copy of the September 29,2003, \nletter of Joel Sweet to Stephen Gold and David Kahne is attached as Exhibit C; see page 2. \nTasker Homes is a newly constructed PHA development.  Its first phase comprises 245 rental \nunits spread over six blocks in South Philadelphia bounded by Morris Street, New Hope Street, \nDSB:964341.2IPHI223-146638  2 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 137   Filed 04/23/04   Page 5 of 9\n29th Street, 21 st Street and Yare Avenue.  Of the 245 units, 173 are townhouses?  True and \ncorrect pictures of a typical Tasker Homes townhouse is attached as Exhibit D.  Tasker Homes \nalso includes a three-story, 72-unit building for the elderly and near-elderly.  PHA proposed to \nmake 11 of the Tasker Homes units, seven townhouses and four apartments in the senior \nbuilding, accessible as part of Phase II of the Settlement Agreement.  These 11 units are in \naddition to any units required to be made accessible pursuant to federal regulations.  PHA \nprovided plaintiffs with a rendition of the Tasker Homes townhouses with the September 29, \n2003, letter.  See Exhibit B to September 29 letter.  It also offered to provide further information \nupon request. \nBecause plaintiffs' counsel was traveling, PHA agreed to allow plaintiffs to respond to \nPHA's offer on October 27, instead of by October 13, as required by the Settlement Agreement. \nPlaintiffs' counsel notified PHA by telephone on October 27 of their clients' rejection of the \nTasker Homes units.  In a letter dated October 29,2003, plaintiffs stated, \"Plaintiffs reject the \nTasker Home Development proposal because this is a conventional project and not scattered site \nunits.\" A true and correct copy of the letter of Stephen Gold to Joel Sweet dated October 29, \n2003, is attached as Exhibit E. \nPHA responded on November 4, 2003, that plaintiffs' rejection was unreasonable in light \nof their failure \"to meaningfully inquire[] into the nature of the homes and the community being \ncreated at Tasker.\"  A true and correct copy of the letter of Joel Sweet to Stephen Gold dated \nNovember 4,2003, is attached as Exhibit F.  PHA asked plaintiffs to reconsider their rejection \nand offered additional information on the project.  Id.  Plaintiffs failed to respond. \n2  Under the Settlement Agreement, a \"townhouse\" is \"a building consisting of up to three \ndwelling units that is no more than three stories in height.  The building itself may either \nstand alone or be part of a row or twin grouping, and the units within the building may be \nstacked or adjacent to each other.\"  Settlement Agreement, Section B, page 4. \nDSB:964341.2/PHI223-146638  3 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 137   Filed 04/23/04   Page 6 of 9\nOn April 13, 2004, before burdening this Court with a motion, PHA again requested \nplaintiffs' approval of the 11 units at Tasker Homes.3  A true and correct copy of the letter of \nAbbe F. Fletman to Stephen Gold dated April 13, 2004, is attached as Exhibit G.  In the April 13, \n2003, letter, PHA asked plaintiffs to \"promptly to reconsider their rejection of the Tasker Homes \nunits\" because \"the Tasker Homes units are well-designed low-density townhouses.\"  Id. \nBy letter dated April 20, 2004, plaintiffs did not provide an answer but instead asked: \n\"[W]hat is the bedroom sizes [sic] that are being constructed, where are the 5% units going (with \nregards to bedroom size and type of unit), and what are the proposed bedroom sizes and types of \nhouses that are proposed for the 11 additional units that you request we accept?\"  A true and \ncorrect copy of the April 20, 2004, letter from Stephen F. Gold to Abbe F. Fletman is attached as \nExhibit 1.  PHA already has informed plaintiffs that it proposes to offer 11 new accessible units \nat Tasker Homes.  Nowhere does the Settlement Agreement contain information regarding the \nbedroom size or the exact location of accessible units, or provide any right to plaintiffs to obtain \nthis information.4 \n3  PHA also offered plaintiffs eight additional accessible units at Schuylkill Falls in a letter \ndated February 21,2003.  A true and correct copy of the letter of Joel M. Sweet to \nStephen Gold dated February 21,2003, is attached as Exhibit H.  PHA reiterated this \noffer in the September 29,2003, letter.  See Exhibit B.  In a letter dated October 29, \n2003, plaintiffs' counsel inquired whether the eight units proposed for Schuylkill Falls \nwere in addition to the other 15 provided in the Settlement Agreement.  In a letter dated \nNovember 4,2003, PHA responded that the eight additional units were in addition to the \n15 provided for in the Settlement Agreement, for a total of 23 accessible units at \nSchuylkill Falls.  See Exhibit F. In the April 20 letter, plaintiffs' counsel stated he \n\"assumed that the prior agreement with regards to the size and type of units in Schuylkill \nFalls has not changed, and the distribution remains as we had agreed.\"  See Exhibit I. \nPHA's offer of eight accessible garden-style apartment units has not changed.  PHA \ntherefore assumes plaintiffs have accepted these units. \n4  PHA is concerned about plaintiffs' request for such information because, as explained in \nits response to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Disclosure of Accessible Housing Units, \nplaintiffs seek such information so they can contact PHA residents who live in accessible \nhousing.  These residents are not clients of plaintiffs' counsel and may not wish to be \nOS8:964341 .2/PHI223-146638  4 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 137   Filed 04/23/04   Page 7 of 9\nPHA has properly sought plaintiffs' approval of the Tasker Homes units, has been \nunreasonably denied approval, and therefore seeks relief from this Court. \nARGUMENT \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, PHA may offer units different that the ones identified \nin the Settlement Agreement, and plaintiffs may not unreasonably withhold acceptance. \nSettlement Agreement, Section B at page 7.  PHA has proposed to include 11 new accessible \nunits at Tasker Homes as part of Phase II under the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs have failed \nto articulate any reason to reject these units other than that Tasker Homes is \"a conventional \nproject and not scattered site units.\"  See Exhibit E. \nPHA disagrees.  First, the Settlement Agreement contains no definition of either the term \n\"conventional\" or \"scattered-site.\" Tasker Homes is a mixed-income development that, when \ncompleted, will include home ownership as well as rental units over a number of city blocks. \nSuch a development is hardly \"conventional\" and eventually the rental units will be interspersed \nwith home ownership units. \nSecond, the accessible units being offered are new and well appointed.  They are not in \ntowers.  Instead, they either comply with the definition of \"townhouse\" contained in the \nSettlement Agreement (Section B, at page 4), or are one-bedroom apartments set aside for the \nelderly and near-elderly.  It cannot it really be in the interest of plaintiffs to reject sound new \naccessible units in a mixed-income development that will include home ownership, rental and \nintruded upon.  Moreover, the Settlement Agreement nowhere requires that PHA disclose \nindividual addresses or bedroom configuration to plaintiffs' counsel.  Indeed, PHA \noffered to provide plaintiffs' counsel with a third-party certification that it has created a \nspecific number of accessible public housing rental units that are ready for occupancy. \nPlaintiffs rejected this offer. \nDSB:964341.2/PHI223-146638  5 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB   Document 137   Filed 04/23/04   Page 8 of 9\nsenior housing in favor of old housing stock that was never intended to house the disabled.  This \nis the height of unreasonableness. \nCONCLUSION \nFor all ofthe foregoing reasons, defendant, the Philadelphia Housing Authority, requests \nthat Court approve the inclusion of 11 units at Tasker Homes among the Phase II units under the \nSettlement Agreement. \n4bl.(>  ~ ~~ \nAlan C.

May 15, 2007\nPlaintiff, ADAPT of Philadelphia (\"ADAPT\"),1 filed suit\nagainst defendants, the Philadelphia Housing Authority (\"PHA\")\nand Carl Greene, Executive Director of PHA, on August 27, 1998. \nADAPT alleged violations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), for failure of defendants to provide\na sufficient number of scattered-site housing units accessible to\nlow income individuals with mobility impairments.  See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794, 24 C.F.R. §§ 8.22 and 8.23.  \nThis action has a long and contentious history which is\nrecorded elsewhere and will not be repeated here except as\nnecessary.  On May 20, 2002, the court approved a Settlement\nAgreement in which PHA agreed to provide over a period of several\nyears certain additional scattered-site housing units accessible\nto the mobility impaired.  Now, before this court, is the motion\n1.  The other plaintiffs in the case were, Liberty Resources,\nInc., Marie Watson, Marshall Watson and Diane Hughes.  They are\nnot relevant for present purposes.\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 2 of 16\nof ADAPT for attorneys' fees in connection with its enforcement\nand monitoring of the Settlement Agreement since that date.\nI.\nOn July 26, 2000, after a non-jury trial, we found in\nfavor of ADAPT.  We determined that between 1993 and 1997 PHA was\nrequired under the Rehabilitation Act to provide 269 public\nhousing scattered site units2 accessible for individuals with\nmobility impairments but that it had only made 21 such units\navailable.  ADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-\n4609, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11052 at *5 (E.D. Pa. July 26, 2000). \nPHA was ordered to provide an additional 248 accessible\nscattered-site units for occupancy by September 1, 2004.  Id.\nWhile the matter was on appeal, the parties reached a\nsettlement.  By Order dated May 20, 2002 we approved the\nSettlement Agreement and dismissed the action with prejudice\npursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.  However, we retained jurisdiction \"to enforce the\nterms of the Settlement Agreement and to adjudicate Plaintiffs'\nmotion for attorney's fees and costs.\"  ADAPT of Phila. v. Phila.\nHous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-4609 (E.D. Pa. May 20, 2002); see\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375 (1994). \n2.  \"Scattered site dwelling units are usually located in\nindividual row houses scattered among or surrounded by private\nhomes, although some scattered site units are in houses that are\nadjacent to other PHA scattered site buildings.  Most of PHA's\nscattered site houses have only one dwelling unit, while others\nare divided into two or more different apartments.\"  ADAPT of\nPhila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-4609, 2000 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 5380 at *3 (E.D. Pa. April 14, 2000).\n-2-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 3 of 16\nThe Order also gave ADAPT a sixty day extension of time to file a\nmotion for attorneys' fees and costs.  The parties thereafter\nstipulated to and the court granted a further extension.  ADAPT\nmade its filing on September 4, 2002.  We denied the motion as\nmoot on January 10, 2003 upon receiving notification that the\nparties had resolved the issue over ADAPT's attorneys' fees\nincurred up to May 20, 2002.\nThe Settlement Agreement set forth a schedule for PHA\nto make available the 248 accessible public housing units\nrequired as a result of our July 26, 2000 Memorandum and Order. \nIn what the parties deemed as \"Phase I,\" 124 accessible units\nwere to be completed and ready for occupancy no later than\nDecember 31, 2003.  Under \"Phase II,\" PHA agreed to meet an\noccupancy deadline of no later than December 31, 2005 for the\nremaining 124 units.\nFrom May 20, 2002 to December 31, 2003, the end of\nPhase I, the parties worked together to implement the Settlement\nAgreement.  After the Phase I deadline had passed, ADAPT began to\nsuspect that PHA had not met its obligations, and the cooperative\nnature of the parties' relationship began to deteriorate.\nIn February 2004 ADAPT wrote to PHA to inquire about\nthe status of the Phase I units.  PHA replied on March 4, 2004\nthat it was in compliance except for needed \"cosmetic changes\" to\n37 units.  ADAPT visually inspected some of the Phase I units and\nconcluded that a number of them had not been completed or were\nnot otherwise ready for occupancy.  It then requested that PHA\n-3-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 4 of 16\nprovide the addresses of all 124 Phase I units so that it could\ndetermine whether PHA had adhered to the Settlement Agreement. \nPHA refused.  On April 20, 2004 ADAPT filed a motion to compel,\nseeking the addresses of the 124 Phase I units.  We granted\nADAPT's motion on May 10, 2004.  PHA appealed our decision to our\nCourt of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction.  ADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d\n390 (3d Cir. 2005).\nOn June 25, 2004 ADAPT filed its second and third\nmotions to compel.  In its second motion, ADAPT sought the leases\nfor the 124 Phase I units to verify that PHA had leased the units\nprior to the December 31, 2003 deadline.  ADAPT's third motion to\ncompel sought medical verification forms for occupants of the\nPhase I units to determine if they in fact needed the\naccessibility features of the Phase I units.  On September 3,\n2004 we granted ADAPT's second and third motions to compel. \nADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-4609, 2004\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 19159 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 3, 2004).  PHA again\nappealed our Order and again the appeal was dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction.  ADAPT of Phila., 417 F.3d at 392.\nWhile ADAPT's second and third motions to compel were\npending, it concluded that PHA had not complied with the Phase I\ndeadline.  On July 6, 2004 ADAPT filed a motion to enforce the\nSettlement Agreement, which the court had approved on May 20,\n2002.  It sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  ADAPT\nmaintained that PHA failed to meet the Phase I deadline and that\n-4-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 5 of 16\nthe residents in 36 of the accessible units were not eligible to\noccupy them.  On July 20, 2004 PHA filed its own motion to\nenforce the Settlement Agreement, or, in the alternative, to\nvacate the Settlement Agreement.  \nIn June 2005, this court held a seven day evidentiary\nhearing regarding the motions.  From the time ADAPT filed its\nmotion to enforce until the evidentiary hearing, the parties\nconducted discovery and engaged in extensive motion practice.  On\nAugust 29, 2005, we denied both motions to enforce the Settlement\nAgreement and PHA's alternative motion to vacate.  We held that\nPHA did not violate the Settlement Agreement when it leased units\nto 36 residents that ADAPT challenged as ineligible for mobility\nimpaired housing.  We stated:\nWhile the efforts, procedures, and oversight\nof PHA and its leasing agents have not always\nbeen optimal and their record keeping has\noften been inadequate, we find and conclude\nthat plaintiffs have not proven that any of\nthe occupants of the 36 units has been placed\nthere in violation of the Settlement\nAgreement....Each person residing in the\nunits in issue has a disability or\ndisabilities which \"require the accessibility\nfeatures of the particular unit\" in which he\nor she is living. \nADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-4609, 2005\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 25785 at *66 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 29, 2005).\nWith regard to ADAPT's allegation that PHA failed to\ncomply with the Phase I deadline, we concluded:\nWe find that PHA violated the December 31,\n2003 deadline for not having all 149 of the\nsettlement units \"ready for occupancy\" by\nthat time.  Nonetheless, the motion to\n-5-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 6 of 16\nenforce was not filed for many months after\nthe deadline, and it is now almost two years\nlater.  All of these units have long since\nbeen available for leasing.  The matter is\nnow moot.  We trust that the next group of\nscattered site accessible settlement units\nwill actually be made \"ready for occupancy\"\nby December 31, 2005 as called for under the\nSettlement Agreement.  PHA should take\nwhatever steps are necessary to ensure that\nthere are no \"cosmetic changes\" or other\nobstacles remaining to be fixed in these\nunits after this upcoming deadline.  If these\nunits are not ready by that date, nothing\nherein precludes plaintiffs from promptly\nseeking the aid of the court.\nId. at *69.\nFollowing our August 29, 2005 Memorandum and Order we\nheard nothing from the parties until May 11, 2006 when counsel\nfor ADAPT wrote a letter to the court stating:  \"This letter\nhappily informs the Court that PHA appears to have complied with\nthe December 31, 2005 deadline for construction and occupancy of\nthe required units.  Other than attorney fees for monitoring the\ncourt's Order and Settlement Agreement there are no further\nissues before the Court.\"  Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for\nAttorneys' Fees at Ex. A.\nIt was not until November 21, 2006, over six months\nafter the court received counsel's letter, that ADAPT filed the\nmotion for attorneys' fees that is presently before us.  The\nmotion seeks fees for work performed from May 20, 2002, when this\ncourt approved the Settlement Agreement, until June 23, 2006. \nADAPT argues that it is entitled to attorneys' fees for:  (1)\nenforcement efforts in the amount of $251,046.00; and (2)\n-6-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 7 of 16\nmonitoring efforts in the amount of $299,240.25.  PHA opposes the\nmotion on a number of grounds.\nII.\nUnder the \"American Rule,\" parties are generally\nobligated to bear their own attorneys' fees and costs. \nBuckhannon Bd. & Home Care, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health\n& Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001).  However, statutes may,\nas here, contain fee shifting provisions which allow prevailing\nparties to recover attorneys' fees and costs.  The Rehabilitation\nAct reads, \"In any action or proceeding to enforce or charge a\nviolation of a provision of this title [29 USCS §§ 790 et seq.],\nthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party...a\nreasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"  29 U.S.C.\n§ 794a(b) (emphasis added).  \n\"[P]laintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for\nattorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue\nin litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties\nsought in bringing suit.\"  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n433 (1983) (quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st\nCir. 1978)).  Both enforceable judgments on the merits and court-\nordered consent decrees \"create the material alteration of the\nlegal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of\nattorney's fees.\"  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604 (quoting Texas\nState Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 498 U.S. 792-\n93 (1989)).  However, the Supreme Court cautioned in Buckhannon\nthat \"[o]ur precedents...counsel against holding that the term\n-7-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 8 of 16\n'prevailing party' authorizes an award of attorney's fees without\na corresponding alteration in the legal relationships of the\nparties.\"  Id. at 605 (emphasis in original).  \nIn interpreting Hensley and its progeny, our Court of\nAppeals has held that, in addition to judgments on the merits and\ncourt-ordered consent decrees, a stipulated settlement may confer\n\"prevailing party\" status but only if the court order approving\nthe settlement:  \"1) contains mandatory language; 2) is entitled\n'Order,' 3) bears the signature of the District Court judge, not\nthe parties' counsel; and 4) provides for judicial enforcement.\" \nP.N. v. Clementon Bd. of Educ., 442 F.3d 848, 853 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(internal citations omitted). \nPHA argues that the May 20, 2002 Order approving the\nparties Settlement Agreement was not a consent decree and\ntherefore that ADAPT was not a \"prevailing party.\"  Our Order\nstated:\nPursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., it\nis ORDERED that this case is DISMISSED WITH\nPREJUDICE, on the condition that the parties\ncomply with all terms of their Court-approved\nSettlement Agreement...In accordance with\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Company\nof America, 511 U.S. 375 (1994), the Court\nretains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of\nthe Settlement Agreement and to adjudicate\nPlaintiffs' petition for attorneys' fees and\ncosts.  For purposes of determining an award\nof attorneys' fees and costs, Plaintiffs are\nprevailing parties....\nADAPT of Phila. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., Civ.A. No. 98-4609 (E.D.\nPa. May 20, 2002).\n-8-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 9 of 16\nWe believe that the May 20, 2002 Order, however\ncharacterized, approving the stipulated settlement satisfies the\nfactors enunciated in P.N. v. Clementon.  It contains mandatory\nlanguage, it is entitled \"Order,\" it is signed by this court, and\nit provides for the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the\nterms of the Settlement Agreement.  It even explicitly confers\nprevailing party status on ADAPT. \nIII.\nPHA next argues that ADAPT's motion for attorneys' fees\nis untimely.  Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nprovides, in part:  \nUnless otherwise provided by statute or order\nof the court, the motion [for attorneys'\nfees] must be filed no later than 14 days\nafter entry of judgment; must specify the\njudgment and the statute, rule, or other\ngrounds entitling the moving party to the\naward; and must state the amount or provide a\nfair estimate of the amount sought.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B).  \nRule 54 permits courts to extend the fourteen day time\nlimit.  It must be read, however, in conjunction with Rule 6,\nwhich states:\nEnlargement.  When by these rules or by a\nnotice given thereunder or by order of court\nan act is required or allowed to be done at\nor within a specified time, the court for\ncause shown may at any time in its discretion\n(1) with or without motion or notice order\nthe period enlarged if request therefor is\nmade before the expiration of the period\noriginally prescribed or as extended by a\nprevious order, or (2) upon motion made after\nthe expiration of the specified period permit\n-9-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 10 of 16\nthe act to be done where the failure to act\nwas the result of excusable neglect....\nFed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).\nRule 6 mandates different standards depending upon when\nthe moving party requests an extension of time.  We may exercise\nour discretion with or without a motion before the filing\ndeadline has expired.  The court may therefore act even if the\nmoving party only requests, without the formality of a motion,\nthe court to do so.  If the moving party does not seek an\nextension until after the time limit has expired, the court may\nexercise its discretion only if a motion is made and the moving\nparty proves its failure to comply with the applicable deadline\nwas the result of excusable neglect.  The Supreme Court in Lujan\nv. National Wildlife Federation, discussed the importance of the\npre-deadline, post-deadline distinction, stating:\nRule 6(b) establishes a clear distinction\nbetween \"requests\" and \"motions,\" and the one\ncannot be converted into the other without\nviolating its provisions....  Rule 6(b)(1)\nallows a court (\"for cause shown\" and \"in its\ndiscretion\") to grant a \"request\" for an\nextension of time, whether the request is\nmade \"with or without motion or notice,\"\nprovided the request is made before the time\nfor filing expires.  After the time for\nfiling has expired, however, the court (again\n\"for cause shown\" and \"in its discretion\")\nmay extend the time only \"upon motion.\"  To\ntreat all postdeadline \"requests\" as\n\"motions\" (if indeed any of them can be\ntreated that way) would eliminate the\ndistinction between predeadline and\npostdeadline filings that the Rule\npainstakingly draws.  Surely the postdeadline\n\"request,\" to be even permissibly treated as\na \"motion,\" must contain a high degree of\nformality and precision, putting the opposing\n-10-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 11 of 16\nparty on notice that a motion is at issue and\nthat he therefore ought to respond.\n497 U.S. 871, 896, n.5 (1990).\nWith regard to ADAPT's motion for enforcement fees, PHA\nargues that the clock began to run under Rule 54(d)(2)(B) on\nAugust 29, 2005 when we denied ADAPT's motion to enforce the\nSettlement Agreement.  Thus, according to PHA, ADAPT's motion in\nthis regard had to be filed by September 12, 2005.  We agree.  \nRule 54 states, \"'Judgment' as used in these rules\nincludes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.  A\njudgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of\na master or the record of prior proceedings.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n54(a).  Assuming ADAPT was entitled to attorneys' fees for its\nunsuccessful enforcement efforts, a dubious proposition at best,\nit had fourteen days from the entry of our August 29, 2005 Order\nto file a motion for attorneys' fees related to enforcement.  \nUnlike our May 20, 2002 Order approving the Settlement\nAgreement, the August 29, 2005 Order did not provide for an\nextension of time.  Again, unlike what happened in 2002, the\nparties never stipulated to and ADAPT never sought an extension\nwithin the fourteen day time limit or at any point thereafter. \nADAPT simply filed its motion for enforcement fees over a year\nlater on November 21, 2006.  ADAPT's motion for enforcement fees\nis therefore out of time.\nWe now turn to ADAPT's motion as it relates to\nmonitoring fees.  ADAPT claims that it is entitled to monitoring\n-11-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 12 of 16\nfees for time spent on the three motions to compel discovery and\nits other efforts to determine whether PHA was complying with the\nSettlement Agreement to make available the scattered-site housing\nunits for the mobility impaired over the required three year\nperiod.  We must start again by determining when the Rule\n54(d)(2)(B) clock began to run.  PHA argues that ADAPT was\nrequired to file its motion for monitoring fees by May 25, 2006,\nfourteen days after ADAPT informed the court by letter that PHA\ncomplied with the Phase II deadline.  ADAPT counters that its\nmotion is timely because monitoring activities do not necessarily\nlead to a \"judgment\" that triggers the start of the fourteen day\ntime limit.  Therefore, according to ADAPT, the fourteen day\nfiling period is not mandatory so long as the opposing party has\nnotice of its intention to seek attorneys' fees.\nAssuming for now that ADAPT would be entitled to fees\nfor monitoring, we agree that the fourteen day clock did not\nbegin to run when this court approved the Settlement Agreement on\nMay 20, 2002.  Prevailing parties' motions for post-judgment\nmonitoring fees have been explicitly approved by the Supreme\nCourt.  In Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for\nClean Air, the Supreme Court held that attorneys' monitoring\nefforts can be \"as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief\nfor their client as was all of their earlier work in the\ncourtroom....\"  478 U.S. 546, 558 (1986).  Such efforts can play\na vital role in assuring compliance with court-ordered consent\ndecrees.  See, e.g., Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343 (1999);\n-12-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 13 of 16\nAlderman v. Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp., 725 F. Supp. 861\n(E.D. Pa. 1989). \nPost-judgment monitoring often is a lengthy and arduous\ntask.  At any given time the effort expended by the attorneys to\nassure compliance can rival that leading up to a settlement.  It\nwould be an unwise use of the attorneys' resources and a drain on\njudicial economy to require parties to file motions for\nattorneys' fees after every step in the monitoring process.  \nOn May 11, 2006, ADAPT wrote to the court that its\nmonitoring activity was at an end since PHA was in compliance\nwith the Settlement Agreement's Phase II deadline.  Accordingly,\nthe Rule 54(d)(2)(B) time limit was triggered at least by that\ndate.  Unfortunately, ADAPT did not request in its letter, or\notherwise, additional time in which to file a motion for\nattorneys' fees.  Again this is in contrast to what occurred with\nrespect to ADAPT's claim for attorneys' fees incurred up to\nMay 20, 2002.  At that time it sought an extension to file its\nmotion, and we granted the additional time not only in our Order\nof May 20, 2002 but in a subsequent Order as well.\nADAPT argues that its motion for attorneys' fees\ncomplies with the \"spirit\" of Rule 54 and that the fourteen day\ntime limit should not be mandatory because PHA had notice through\nADAPT's May 11, 2006 letter to the court that it intended to seek\nattorneys' fees.  Furthermore, ADAPT has submitted affidavits\nfrom its attorneys that outline its efforts to resolve the issue\nof attorneys' fees privately without involving the court. \n-13-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 14 of 16\nNonetheless, as far as the record before us is concerned, PHA\nnever agreed to refrain from opposing as untimely a belated\nmotion for attorneys' fees if negotiations broke down.\nWe acknowledge that notice to the opposing party is one\nconcern that Rule 54 was designed to address.  The Advisory\nCommittee note to the 1993 Amendment adding the fourteen day\ndeadline states:  \"One purpose of this provision is to assure\nthat the opposing party is informed of the claim before the time\nfor appeal has elapsed ....\"  Notice, however, is not the only\nconcern expressed in the Advisory Committee note, which goes on\nto say, \"Prompt filing affords an opportunity for the court to\nresolve fee disputes shortly after trial, while the services\nperformed are freshly in mind.\"\nEven if PHA had ample notice of ADAPT's intention to\nfile a motion for attorneys' fees, ADAPT's six month delay in\nactually filing its motion undermines the interest in resolving\nthese disputes while the services are \"freshly in mind.\" \nParticularly in a case such as this, where the motion seeks\nattorneys' fees for enforcement and monitoring efforts going back\nfour years, adjudicating fees in a timely fashion is important. \nSignificant efforts would be involved here to separate ADAPT's\nclaims for enforcement fees from its claims for monitoring\nfees—an endeavor that is more easily done when there is\ncompliance with Rule 54.  \nFinally, ADAPT's assertion that the fourteen day time\nlimit in Rule 54(d)(2)(B) is not mandatory when the opposing\n-14-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 15 of 16\nparty is given notice of its intention to seek attorneys' fees is\nunsupported by case law.  In Schering Corp. v. Amgen, Inc., cited\nby ADAPT, the court held that Rule 54 (d)(2)(B) was not mandatory\nwhere the court had previously denied the defendant's motion for\nattorneys' fees \"with leave to renew at the conclusion of \nSchering's currently contemplated appeal.\"  Civ.A. No. 96-587,\n2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4127 at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 10, 2001).  Rule\n54 states, \"[u]nless otherwise provided by statute or order of\nthe court, the motion [for attorneys' fees] must be filed no\nlater than 14 days after entry of judgment.\"  Rule 54(d)(2)(B)\n(emphasis added).  The rule explicitly allows courts to extend\nthe fourteen day time limit, which the court in Schering chose to\ndo.  At no time, however, were we asked to extend the time, and\nthus, we have never done so.  Accordingly, ADAPT's motion for\nmonitoring fees also comes too late.3\n3.  As a result, we do not reach the question whether ADAPT would\nhave been entitled to monitoring fees had its motion been timely.\n-15-\n\nCase 2:98-cv-04609-HB     Document 318      Filed 05/15/2007     Page 16 of 16\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nADAPT OF PHILADELPHIA, et al. : CIVIL ACTION\n:\nv. :\n:\nPHILADELPHIA HOUSING AUTHORITY, :\net al. : NO. 98-4609\nORDER\nAND NOW, on this 15th day of May, 2007, for the reasons\nset forth in the accompanying Memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED\nthat the motion of plaintiff, ADAPT of Philadelphia, for\nattorneys' fees is DENIED.\nBY THE COURT:\n/s/ Harvey Bartle III         \nC.J.\n-16-",
