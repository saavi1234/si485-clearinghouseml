For at least the past several years, the Multnomah \nCounty Sheriffs Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \n\nthe Multnomah County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe  written  procedures  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriffs  Department,  and  was \npromulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendant Bernie Giusto. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial \nDistrict, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, have recently \nheld  that blanket  strip search policies/practices like those in dispute in this case are \nunconstitutional.  In short, the policy of Multnomah County and the Multnomah County \nSheriffs Department  of  forcing  those  charged  with  minor  crimes  to  undergo  the \nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the Multnomah County Jail is not only clearly \nillegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary. \nRiley Hinds brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class \nmembers he proposes to represent. Mr. Hinds was taken in on a mistaken warrant for a \npurported probation violation on or about July 24,2006. Mr. Hinds was transported to the \nMultnomah County Jail and was at later dates subjected to multiple strip searches, in \nviolation of his right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  He seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of \nthe proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriffs Department's  policies/practices are \nunconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Multnomah County and the Multnomah \n\nCounty Sheriffs Department from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into \ntheir custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Riley Hinds, through counsel, hereby \ncomplains; as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§$  1331  , 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  §$ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction  over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. 9 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs claims  and those  of proposed  class members  occurred  in  this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n21). Plaintiff Riley Hinds (\"Hinds\")  resides in Multnomah County, Oregon.  On or \nabout July 24, 2006, the Clackamas County Sheriffs Office officers took Mr. Hinds into \ncustody and transported him to the Justice Center (MCDC) where he spent four days on a \nwrongfully issued warrant for failure to report for bench probation that was incorrectly \ncoded as formal probation on an underlying misdemeanor.  He was strip and cavity \nsearched on or about July 24,2006. \n\n2c.  Defendant  Multnomah  County  (the  \"County\")  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon.  At all times relevant \nhereto,  the  County, acting through  its Sheriffs Department, was responsible  for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe  Multnomah  County  Jail  and  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Department personnel, including those working \nin  the  Multnomah  County Jail.  In  addition,  at all relevant times,  the  County  was \nresponsib:le for enforcing the rules of the Multnomah County Jail, and for ensuring that \nSheriffs  Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States and of the State of Oregon. \n3.  The Multnomah County Sheriffs Department (the \"Sheriffs Department\") is \na County Sheriffs Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of \nOregon.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Sheriffs Department  was  responsible  for \noperating,  organizing,  overseeing  and  administering  the  Multnomah  County  Jail \n(\"MCJ\").  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriffs Department, together with \nMultnornah  County  was  responsible  for  the  polices,  practices,  supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the MCJ, and was responsible for \nthe appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Department personnel, \nincluding those working in the MCJ.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant \nSheriffs Department, together with Multnomah County, was responsible for enforcing \nthe rules of the Multnomah County Jail, and for ensuring that  Sheriffs Department \npersonnel employed in the MCJ obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States \nand of the State of Oregon. \n\n4.  Defendant Bernie Giusto (\"Sheriff  Giusto\")  is the duly elected Sheriff of \nMultnomah County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre- \ntrial and other detainees over which the MCJ exercises custodial or other control. Sheriff \nGiusto is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n5.  Collectively,  Sheriff  Giusto  will  be  referred  to  as  the  \"Policy  Making \nDefendant.\" \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Multnomah County Jail. \n7.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nMultnomah  County Jail  after  being  charged with misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Multnomah County Jail pursuant \nto  the  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County \nSheriffs Department and  Multnomah  County.  The class period \ncommences on November 8, 2005 and extends to the date on which \nthe Multnomah County Sheriffs Department andlor the County of \nMultnomah are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Multnomah County Jail every month - \nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 3,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n\n10. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number  of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Multnomah County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually . \n11. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by  Defendants7 \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Multnomah \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n12. Plaintiffs claims are typical  of the  claims of the members  of the  Class. \nPlaintiff  and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n13. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no inrerests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n14. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of civil rights litigation. \n\n15. Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the class. \n16. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith  misdemeanor  or  minor  crimes  and  placed  into the  custody  of the  Multnomah \nCounty Jail.  In  short, the  County of Multnomah,  the Multnomah County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the Policy Making Defendants and Multnomah County Corrections Officers \nacted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n17'. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n18. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policy/practice \nof  strip  :searching all  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and \ncommitted to the Multnomah County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the class period. \n19. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder  of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \n\nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to  redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court  system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court  system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n201. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several \nyears. \n21. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks parfial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n22. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and the  Corrections \nOfficers they  supervise, from performing  strip  searches of  arrestees who have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor  crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n23. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of Multnomah,  the  Multnomah \nCounty Sheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written \nandlor de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the \ncustody of the Multnomah County Jail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a \nvisual inspection of their bodies and/or forcing them to submit to a visua'l inspection of \ntheir bod:y cavities) and are placed into jail  clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged  crime  and without the presence  of reasonable  suspicion to believe  that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of this Complaint, strip \nand visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n24. The County of Multnomah, the Multnomah County Sheriffs Department, and \nthe  Policy  Making  Defendants know  that  they  may  not  institute,  enforce  or  permit \nenforcem.ent of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion,  with  this  principle  being  clearly  established  in \nKennedy v. Los Angeles P. D., 901 F2d 702,711, (9th Cir. 1990). \n\n25  The  Defendants'  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated andlor enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n26. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n27. Upon  information and  belief,  the  County  of Multnomah,  the  Multnomah \nCounty  Sheriffs  Department  and  Policy  Making  Defendants  have  promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice \nor custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Multnomah \nCounty Jail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, \nor indeed  suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip \nsearching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to \nthe enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches. \n28. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the A4ultnomah County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishrnent of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not  supported by  reasonable \nsuspicion.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n\n29. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant tlo this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - \neach member of the class, including the named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n30. Mr. Riley Hinds'  experience is representative of the class at large. He was \nstrip and cavity searched on or about July 24,2006. \n3 1. On the above-mentioned occasion, Hinds was moved into a shower area in the \nMultnomah County Jail and ordered to disrobe.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Mr. \nHinds removed all of his clothing, including his underpants. \n32. On each occasion, a Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Hinds to lift his \ntesticles, turn around, bend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while \ncoughing., with the Corrections Officer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Hind's \ngenitals and rectal cavity.  Mr. Hinds was then provided with a jail uniform after taking a \nshower. \n33. On each occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Hinds \nwas concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. \nHinds that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. \n34. On several other occasions during the class period, Hinds was taken to the \nMultnomah County Jail on identical or nearly identical circumstances tc,  that detailed \nabove. \n\n35. As  a  direct and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search conducted \npursuant 'to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, LM~H.i nds has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \n-- \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law \n36. Plaintiff  incorporates by  reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 37. \n37. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by  law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized  suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n38. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Multnomah \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to orderldirect Multnomah County Corrections Officers to \nconduct such searches. \n39. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Multnomah and the Multnomah County Sheriffs Department.  As such, \nthe County of Multnomah is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n40. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Giusto is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Multnomah County Jail, and \n\nis responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit. \nAs such, Giusto is individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n41. Sheriff  Giusto  knew  that  the  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n421. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nCj 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n43. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--  -- \nDemand for Declaratory Judgment \n44. Plaintiff incorporates by  reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 45. \n45. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the County of Multnomah and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directinglconducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Multnomah  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n46. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Multnomah and the \nMultnomah County Sheriffs Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--  -- \nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction \n47. Plaintiff  incorporates by  reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in :paragraphs 1 through 48. \n48. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the County of Multnomah and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directinglconducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Multnomah  County  Jail  without  any \n\nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n49. Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nMultnomah  County  Jail,  with  new  and/or  prospective  members  of  the  Class  being \nsubjected to the harms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n50. The  continuing pattern  of  strip  searching individuals charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequa.te remedy for which does not exist at law. \n51. Plaintiff  demands that the  County of  Multnomah, the  Multnomah  County \nSheriffs :Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Multnomah County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe  County Jail Multnomah absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n52.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous. in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that thieir actions are unconstitutional. \n53. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendant, the County of Multnomah and \nthe  Multnomah  County  Sheriffs Department  have no respect  for the  civil rights  of \nindividual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is \nnecessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that \nthe requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to governrncnt officials in \nMultnomah County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n54. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Riley Hinds, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a \nclass  of  others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  him  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment  against all Defendants, jointly  and severally on Plaintiffs First \nCause  of  Action  detailed  herein,  awarding  Compensatory  Damages  to  each  named \nPlaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \n\nC.  A judgment against Defendant Giusto on Plaintiffs First Cause of Action for \n$1,000,00~0.00i n punitive damages. \nD.  A  declaratory  judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  County  of \nMu1tnoma.h and the  Multnomah  County  Sheriffs Department's  policy,  practice  and \ncustom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Multiromah County \nJail, regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional \nand improper. \nE.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. tj 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \nRespectfully submitted by: \nDated:  November 8, 2007 \n~.konax-dR .

For at least the past several years, the Multnomah \n  1 \n\nCounty Sheriff’s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Multnomah County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe  written  procedures  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriff’s  Department,  and  was \npromulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendant Bernie Giusto. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial \nDistrict, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, have recently \nheld that blanket strip search policies/practices like those in dispute in this case are \nunconstitutional.  In short, the policy of Multnomah County and the Multnomah County \nSheriff’s  Department  of  forcing  those  charged  with  minor  crimes  to  undergo  the \nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the Multnomah County Jail is not only clearly \nillegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary.  \n   Riley Hinds, Sandra Silvia, Alan Hakimoglu, Thomas McCallum,  Amy Munson, \nMichael B. McMullin bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class \nof thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class \nmembers he proposes to represent. Mr. Hinds was taken in on a mistaken warrant for a \npurported probation violation on or about July 24, 2006. Mr. Hinds was transported to the \nMultnomah County Jail and was at later dates subjected to multiple strip searches, in \nviolation of his right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.   Alan Hakimoglu was strip searched on or about November \n  2 \n\n14, 2005 for Trespass 2 and February 25, 2008 for Trespass 2,  Disorderly Conduct 2 \ncharges. Sandra Silvia was strip searched December 11, 2006 on Theft and Forgery \ncharges. Thomas McCallum was strip searched on March 25, 2008 , January 11, 2008 \nand January 5, 2007 on DUI  and DWS charges each time. Amy Munson was strip \nsearched on or about September 7, 2006 for DUI charges.  Michael B. McMullin was \nbooked  and  strip  searched  on  June  14,  2006  and  turned  himself  in  on  a  probation \nviolation on March 3, 2008 and was booked and strip  searched for public protest charges \nof Trespass 2, Assault 4 and Disorderly Conduct. They seek monetary damages for \nthemselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff’s \nDepartment’s  policies/practices  are  unconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding \nMultnomah County and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to \nviolate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs \nRiley Hinds et al, through counsel, hereby complain as follows: \n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n  3 \n\n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiff’s  claims  and  those  of  proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this  judicial \ndistrict. \n \nPARTIES \n \n2b. Plaintiff Riley Hinds (“Hinds”) resides in Multnomah County, Oregon.  On or \nabout July 24, 2006, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office officers took Mr. Hinds into \ncustody and transported him to the Justice Center (MCDC) where he spent four days on a \nwrongfully issued warrant for failure to report for bench probation that was incorrectly \ncoded as formal probation on an underlying misdemeanor.   He was strip and cavity \nsearched on or about July 24, 2006. .   Alan Hakimoglu, a Multnomah County resident, \nwas strip searched on or about November 14, 2005 for Trespass 2 and February 25, 2008 \nfor Trespass 2,  Disorderly Conduct 2 charges. Sandra Silvia, a Multnomah County \nresident, was strip searched December 11, 2006 on Theft and Forgery charges. Thomas \nMCallum, a Marion County resident, was strip searched on March 25, 2008 , January 11, \n2008  and  January  5,  2007  on  DUI  and  DWS  charges  each  time.  Amy  Munson,  a \nClackamas County resident, was strip searched on or about September 7, 2006 for DUI \ncharges. .  Michael B. Mcmullin, a Multnomah County resident, was booked and strip \nsearched on June 14, 2006 and turned himself in on a probation violation on March 3, \n2008 and was booked and strip searched for public protest charges of Trespass 2, Assault \n4 and Disorderly Conduct. \n2c.  Defendant  Multnomah  County  (the  “County”)  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon.  At all times relevant \n  4 \n\nhereto, the County, acting through its Sheriff’s Department, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe  Multnomah  County  Jail  and  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department personnel, including those working \nin  the  Multnomah  County  Jail.    In  addition,  at  all  relevant  times,  the  County  was \nresponsible for enforcing the rules of the Multnomah County Jail, and for ensuring that \nSheriff’s Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States and of the State of Oregon. \n3.  The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is \na County Sheriff’s Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of \nOregon.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Sheriff’s  Department  was  responsible  for \noperating,  organizing,  overseeing  and  administering  the  Multnomah  County  Jail \n(“MCJ”).  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff’s Department, together with  \nMultnomah  County  was  responsible  for  the  polices,  practices,  supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the MCJ, and was responsible for \nthe appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department personnel, \nincluding those working in the MCJ.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant \nSheriff’s Department, together with Multnomah County, was responsible for enforcing \nthe rules of the Multnomah County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel employed in the MCJ obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States \nand of the State of Oregon. \n4.  Defendant Bernie Giusto (“Sheriff Giusto”) is the duly elected Sheriff of \nMultnomah County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-\n  5 \n\ntrial and other detainees over which the MCJ exercises custodial or other control. Sheriff \nGiusto is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n5.  Collectively,  Sheriff  Giusto  will  be  referred  to  as  the  “Policy  Making \nDefendant.” \n  6 \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Multnomah County Jail. \n7.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nMultnomah  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Multnomah County Jail pursuant \nto  the  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County \nSheriff’s Department and Multnomah County.  The class period \ncommences on November 8, 2005 and extends to the date on which \nthe Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County of \nMultnomah are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Multnomah County Jail every month – \nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 3,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n  7 \n\n10. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Multnomah County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n11. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Multnomah \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n12. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the  claims of the members of the Class.  \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n13. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n14. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of civil rights litigation.  \n  8 \n\n15. Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the class. \n16. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith  misdemeanor  or  minor  crimes  and  placed  into  the  custody  of  the  Multnomah  \nCounty Jail.  In  short, the County of Multnomah, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the Policy Making Defendants and Multnomah County Corrections Officers \nacted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n17. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n18. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy/practice \nof  strip  searching  all  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and \ncommitted to the Multnomah County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the class period. \n19. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.    Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \n  9 \n\nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n20. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several \nyears. \n21. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n  10 \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n22. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers they supervise, from performing strip searches of  arrestees who have been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n23. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of  Multnomah,  the  Multnomah \nCounty Sheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the \ncustody of the Multnomah County Jail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a \nvisual inspection of their bodies and/or forcing them to submit to a visual inspection of \ntheir body cavities) and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged crime and  without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of this Complaint, strip \nand visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n24. The County of Multnomah, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department, and \nthe  Policy  Making  Defendants  know  that  they  may  not  institute,  enforce  or  permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion,  with  this  principle  being  clearly  established  in \nKennedy v. Los Angeles P.D., 901 F2d 702, 711, (9th Cir. 1990). \n  11 \n\n25. The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n26. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n27. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  County  of  Multnomah,  the  Multnomah \nCounty  Sheriff’s  Department  and  Policy  Making  Defendants  have  promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice \nor custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Multnomah \nCounty Jail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, \nor indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip \nsearching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to \nthe enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n28. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Multnomah County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.    Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n  12 \n\n29. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – \neach member of the class, including the named Plaintiff – has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Hinds  \n30. Mr. Riley Hinds’ experience is representative of the class at large. He was \nstrip and cavity searched on or about July 24, 2006. \n31. On the above-mentioned occasion, Hinds was moved into a shower area in the \nMultnomah County Jail and ordered to disrobe.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Mr. \nHinds removed all of his clothing, including his underpants.   \n32.  On each occasion, a Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Hinds to lift his \ntesticles, turn around, bend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while \ncoughing, with the Corrections Officer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Hind’s \ngenitals and rectal cavity.  Mr. Hinds was then provided with a jail uniform after taking a \nshower.  \n33. On each occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Hinds \nwas concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. \nHinds that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n34. On several other occasions during the class period, Hinds was taken to the \nMultnomah County Jail on identical or nearly identical circumstances to that detailed \nabove.  \n  13 \n\n35. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Hinds has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Hakimoglu \n36.

On each occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. \nHakimoglu was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Mr. Hakimoglu’s that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n40. On several other occasions during the class period, Hakimoglu was taken to \nthe Multnomah County Jail on identical or nearly identical circumstances to that detailed \nabove.  \n41. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant  to  County  and  Sheriff’s  Department  policy,  practice  and  custom,  Mr. \n  14 \n\nHakimoglu has suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering \nand mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff McCallum \n42. Mr. McCallum’s experience is representative of the class at large. He was \nstrip and cavity searched on or about March 25, 2008 , January 11, 2008 and January 5, \n2007. \n43. On the above-mentioned occasions, McCallum was moved into a shower area \nin the Multnomah County Jail and ordered to disrobe.

On each occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. \nMcCallum was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Mr. McCallum that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n46. On several other occasions during the class period, McCallum was taken to \nthe Multnomah County Jail on identical or nearly identical circumstances to that detailed \nabove.  \n47. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. McCallum \n  15 \n\nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff McMullin \n \n48. Mr. McMullin’s experience is representative of the class at large. Michael B. \nMcmullin was booked and strip searched on June 14, 2006 and turned himself in on a \nprobation violation on March 3, 2008 and was booked and strip searched for public \nprotest charges of Trespass 2, Assault 4 and Disorderly Conduct. \n49. On the above-mentioned occasions, McMullin was moved into a shower area \nin the Multnomah County Jail and ordered to disrobe.  As a Corrections Officer watched, \nMr. McMullin removed all of his clothing, including his underpants.   \n50.  On each occasion, a Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. McMullin to lift \nhis testicles, turn around, bend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat \nwhile coughing, with the Corrections Officer conducting a visual inspection of  Mr. \nMcMullin’s genitals and rectal cavity.

Indeed, no inquiry was made of \nMr. McMullin  that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n  16 \n\n52. On several other occasions during the class period, McMullin was taken to the \nMultnomah County Jail on identical or nearly identical circumstances to that detailed \nabove.  \n53. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. McMullin \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Silvia \n54. Ms. Silvia’s experience is representative of the class at large. She was strip \nand cavity searched on or about December 11, 2006. \n55. On the above-mentioned occasion, Ms. Silvia was moved into a shower area \nin the Multnomah County Jail and ordered to disrobe.

Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 63. \n65. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n66. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff’s rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Multnomah \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to order/direct Multnomah County Corrections Officers to \nconduct such searches.   \n67. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Multnomah and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department.  As such, \nthe County of Multnomah is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n68. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Giusto is responsible for establishing the \npolicies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Multnomah County Jail, and \n  19 \n\nis responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  \nAs such, Giusto is individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class.    \n69. Sheriff  Giusto  knew  that  the  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n70. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n71. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n \n  20 \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n \n72. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 71. \n73. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Multnomah and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Multnomah  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n74. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Multnomah and the \nMultnomah County Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \n \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n75. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 74. \n76. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Multnomah and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Multnomah  County  Jail  without  any \n  21 \n\nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n77. Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the  \nMultnomah  County  Jail,  with  new  and/or  prospective  members  of  the  Class  being \nsubjected to the harms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff.   \n78. The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n79. Plaintiff demands that the County of Multnomah, the Multnomah County \nSheriff’s Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Multnomah County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe  County Jail Multnomah absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n \n \n \n  22 \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n80.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n81. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendant, the County of Multnomah and \nthe Multnomah County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of \nindividual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is \nnecessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that \nthe requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nMultnomah County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n82. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Riley Hinds et al, on behalf of themselves and on behalf \nof a class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant him the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff’s First \nCause  of  Action  detailed  herein,  awarding  Compensatory  Damages  to  each  named \nPlaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n  23 \n\nC.  A judgment against Defendant Giusto on Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action for \n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A  declaratory  judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  County  of \nMultnomah  and  the  Multnomah  County  Sheriff’s  Department’s  policy,  practice  and \ncustom of strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Multnomah County \nJail, regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional \nand improper. \nE.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney’s fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted by: \n \n            S//S Leonard R. Berman \n \nDated:  July 23, 2008       __________________________ \n            Leonard R. Berman, OSB # 96040 \nATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFF AND \nTHE PROPOSED CLASS \n \n \n \n  24 ",

SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n   \nMULTNOMAH COUNTY, BERNIE  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 \nGIUSTO, both individually and in his official   \ncapacity as Sheriff,   \n   \nDefendants. \n \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, defendants  Multnomah County and Sheriff Bernie Giusto \nmove this court for summary judgment against plaintiffs’ complaint. \nPlaintiffs Riley Hinds, Sandra Silvia, Alan Hakimoglu, Thomas McCallum, Amy \nMunson, and Michael McMullin allege that in 2006 they each were processed into the \nMultnomah County Detention Center (“MCDC”), and as part of the process, they were subjected \nto a strip search.   (Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 2b, 30-63).  Plaintiffs contend that the strip searches \nPage 1 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nwere unconstitutional because they were performed pursuant to a “written and/or de facto \npolicy” of performing strip searches on all inmates admitted to MCDC.  (Amended Complaint, \n¶¶ 22, 25, 27, 28, 29).  As a result, plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, in \naddition to declaratory and injunctive relief.    \nDefendants Multnomah County and Sheriff Bernie Giusto now move pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56 for summary judgment against plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety.  Summary judgment \nshould be granted because contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions, Multnomah County does not have \neither a written or a de facto policy of performing strip searches on all individuals who enter \nMCDC.  In the absence of such a blanket policy, plaintiffs’ claims must fail as a matter of law.  \nConsequently, defendants are entitled to summary judgment.    \nA.  Standard of Review \nSummary judgment “shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).  “[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute \nbetween the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary \njudgment.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).   \nAt summary judgment, the court’s function is not to make credibility determinations or to \nweigh conflicting evidence. T.W. Elec. Service, Inc v. Pacific Elec. Contractors, Ass’n, 809 F.2d \n626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).  The court must view the facts in a light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party. Id.  However, if the moving party “meets its initial burden of showing ‘the \nabsence of material fact,’ the burden then moves to the opposing party, who must present \nPage 2 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nsignificant and probative evidence tending to support its claim or defense.”  Intel Corp. v. \nHartford Acc. & Indem. Co., 952 F.2d 1551, 1558 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Richards v. Neilson \nFreight Lines, 810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1987).  If the non-moving party fails to make this \nshowing, the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).    \nI.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nPlaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.1  Plaintiffs claim that \nMultnomah County and Sheriff Giusto2 have “instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom \nor practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Multnomah County Jail \n. . .  and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without \nthe presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or \ncontraband.”  (Amended Complaint, ¶ 23).  Plaintiffs bring their claims under the Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  (Id. at ¶ 22).   Plaintiffs caption their Complaint \nas a class action claim brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  However, no class has been \ncertified.   \nAs set forth below, plaintiffs either misconstrue or grossly mischaracterize the \nMultnomah County Sheriff’s Office’s policy relative to strip searches at MCDC.  Multnomah \n                                                 \n1 42 U.S.C. § 1983 states, in relevant part:  \n \n“Every person who, under color of any statute, or dinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any \nState or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of \nthe United States or other person within the jurisd iction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured \nin an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . . ” \n \n2 Defendant Bernie Giusto no longer is Sheriff of Multnomah County.  The current Sheriff is Bob \nSkipper.  Pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P 235( d),  the  public  officer’s  successor is “automat ically \nsubstituted as a party.”   \nPage 3 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nCounty does not have a blanket and/or de facto strip search policy.  Consequently, the County’s \nstrip search policy survives plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge.  \nA.  Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office’s Strip Search Policy \nMultnomah County, through the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office (“MCSO”), \noperates the following detention facilities: the Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC), \nlocated in downtown Portland; Inverness Jail (IJ), located in Northeast Portland; and the \nMultnomah County Courthouse Jail (MCHJ), located on the 7th floor of the County Courthouse.  \nThe County also owns the Wapato Jail in North Portland, which currently is not operational.  \n(Declaration of Ron Bishop, ¶ 3).   During 2007, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office \nprocessed approximately 40,000 inmates through the County’s detention facilities. (Declaration \nof Ron Bishop, ¶ 4).   All bookings and releases take place at MCDC, which is the County’s \nmaximum security, short-term incarceration facility.  Id.  All individuals booked at MCDC are \nsubjected to a pat-down search at the booking counter.  Id.   \nThe Sheriff’s Office has established written policies concerning strip searches and cavity \nsearches of inmates at the County’s custodial facilities.  (Declaration of Ron Bishop, ¶ 5; \nDeclaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 4; Exhibits 101, 102, and 103).  The objective of the strip search \npolicy is to detect and intercept the introduction of contraband into the jail facility.  (Declaration \nof Ron Bishop, ¶ 5; Declaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 5).   Such contraband usually includes \nweapons, narcotics, tobacco, and cigarettes.  Id.  Preventing the introduction of contraband is \nnecessary to maintain institutional order and security, and to protect jail personnel and the inmate \npopulation.

Often, it is just the mere presence of the contraband within \nthe facility, not its actual use, that causes a disruption and presents a serious risk to the security \nof the facility.  Id.  Contraband is sought after, bartered for, and its mere presence can lead to \nviolence among the jail population.  Id. \nNot all inmates booked and processed into MCDC are subjected to a strip search.  \n(Declaration of Ron Bishop, ¶ 5; Declaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 14).  Consequently, despite the \neffective implementation of the MCSO’s strip search policy, contraband continues to make its \nway into the facility.  Id.  The ability to perform strip searches on those inmates that meet the \nreasonable suspicions standards set forth in the MCSO policy is imperative to detect and \neliminate the transport of drugs, weapons and contraband into the jail environment and to \nmaintain the safety and security of the jail facility, its staff, and the general inmate population.  \nId.   \nThe Sheriff’s Office has implemented a series of policies and procedures for the booking, \nintake, and searching of arrestees and inmates at each of the County’s custodial facilities, \nincluding MCDC.  Id.  Included within those policies is a detailed procedure for performing strip \nsearches and body cavity searches on inmates.  (Exhibits 101 and 102).  Those policies and \nprocedures were in existence in 2006, when plaintiffs were processed into MCDC.  Id.   \n  The County’s strip search policy is set forth in sections CD 07.109.10 et seq. and DC \n12.100.040 et seq. of the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Corrections Division Operations \nPage 5 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nManual.3  (Exhibits 101 and 102).  The purpose of the Sheriff’s search policy is to “prevent the \nintroduction or possession of contraband into a Facility, to ensure the safety and security of staff, \ninmates, the public and the Facility.”  (CD07.109.020; Ex 101).  Under the policy, a strip search \nis defined as “[t]he visual inspection of a nude person to detect contraband or medical conditions.  \nIt includes a visual exam of all body cavities, including genitals and anus.  The person is not \ntouched in any manner during the search unless it is a forced search.”  (CD 07.109.040; Exhibit \n101).   \n  The policy also distinguishes between an arrestee and an inmate.  An inmate is defined as \na person “who has been lodged in the jail for arraignment, trial or transfer.  A person arriving on \na transport for lodging in the jail.  A person serving a sentence while in custody of the Sheriff.”  \n(CD 07.109.040; Exhibit 102, p 2).   An “arrestee,” by contrast, is defined a “person who has just \nentered a Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Corrections Facility for booking.  The person has \nreasonable pretrial release options still available.”  Id.  \n  The sheriff’s policy applicable to strip searches was amended on May 28, 2003 by \nadoption of Special Order 03-25.  (Exhibit 102).   Pursuant to that amended policy, inmates are \nsubject to strip searches in a number of particular situations.   \n“CD07.109.053  Inmate/Arrestee Strip-Searches shall be conducted in a professional \nmanner, so as not to harass the inmate, under the following conditions: \n \n1.  During the initial booking process if there is reasonable suspicion the arrestee or \ninmate is or may be carrying or concealing contraband; \n \n2.  When there is a determination of reasonable suspicion between the booking process \nand the dress-in process based on the criteria outlined in DC12.100.111; \n \n                                                 \n3 The MCSO’s strip search policy has been revised through adoption of Special Orders 03-08, 03-\n25, and 04-08.  Those special orders are included in Ex 102.   \nPage 6 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\n3.  During the dress-in process if there is reasonable suspicion the arrestee or inmate is or \nmay be carrying or concealing contraband, using drugs, is concealing a medical problem \nthat may need treatment, or has been taken into custody for a probation or parole \nviolation;   \n \n4.  When entering the facility from a transport from another correctional or detention \nfacility; \n \n5.  When entering the facility from an outside appointment and/or overnight hospital stay; \n \n6.  When returning to the facility from a pass; \n \n7.  When reporting to serve a sentence; \n \n8.  When being held in-transit for another law enforcement or correctional agency; \n \n9.  When returning from temporary custody with an outside agency; \n \n10.  After a contact visit;  \n \n11.  Before returning to a housing area when assigned as an inmate worker; \n \n12.  At random if the inmate is performing inmate worker responsibilities; \n \n13. Upon entering Disciplinary Segregation, unless the inmate has been strip-searched \nbefore the move and has not been out of the sight of the Escorting Deputies.”   \n \n(Exhibit 102, pp 4-5).   \n \n  A strip search may also be performed based on the corrections officer’s reasonable \nsuspicion.  (Declaration of Ron Bishop).  Pursuant to policy, a strip search may take place during \nthe “initial booking process if there is reasonable suspicion the arrestee or inmate is or may be \ncarrying or concealing contraband,” or when there is a “determination of reasonable suspicion \nbetween the booking process and the dress-in process based on the criteria outlined in DC \n12.100.111.”  (CD07.109.053(1), (2); Exhibit 102, p 4).   The strip search policy was further \namended on May 29, 2003, by adoption of Special Order 03-08, which is attached as Ex 101, and \nprovides:    \nPage 7 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\n“Deputies may assume reasonable suspicion based on the following criteria to include \ninformation provided by the Classification Unit and or the Deputies[’] observations of \narrestee. \n \n1.  Current arrest for drug offense(s), violent felony/misdemeanor offense(s), or use \nof weapons felony charge; \n \n2.  History of drug offenses, violent offenses or use of weapons felony crime arrests; \n \n3.  History of escape; \n \n4.  History of arrests of either charges that indicate a significant probability that the \narrestee would possess or traffic in contraband; \n \n5.  The odor of alcohol, drugs, or chemicals; \n \n6.  When the criminal history cannot be established because the arrestee refuses to \nreveal their identity.”   \n \n(DC12.100.111; Exhibit 101, p 4).4 \n \nOver the course of the years in which the policies have been implemented, the Sheriff’s \nOffice has observed that the visual strip searches are effective both in detecting contraband and \nweapons, and in deterring inmates from bringing contraband and weapons into the jail.  \n(Declaration of Ron Bishop, ¶ 11; Declaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 15).  The strip search is \nsuccessful because it reveals items that are not identified with the standard pat-down search.   \n(Declaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 15).  The ability to perform strip searches on those detainees \nwho meet the reasonable suspicions standards set forth in the MCSO policies is imperative to \nmaintaining the safety and security of the jail facility, its staff, and the general inmate population.  \n(Declaration of Ron Bishop, ¶ 12; Declaration of Andrew Brosh, ¶ 14).   Despite these policies, \nhowever, contraband continues to make its way into the secure jail facility.  (Declaration of \n                                                 \n4 The strip search policy was further amended on March 22, 2004 by S pecial Order 04-08. That \namendment concerned the manner in which the searches were performed.   \nPage 8 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nAndrew Brosh, ¶ 14).   Overall, the MCSO strip search policy successfully fulfills the safety and \nsecurity objections for the jail facility, either through active detection and interception, or as a \ndeterrent, with the least amount of inconvenience or affront to the inmate.  (Declaration of \nAndrew Brosh, ¶ 16).   \n  B.  Multnomah County’s strip search policies are constitutional. \nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that the “right of the \npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \nand seizures, shall not be violated.”   This right has been applied to prisoners; however, the \n“reasonableness of a particular search is determined by reference to the prison context.”  \nMichenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988).   \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 US 520, 561, 60 LEd2d 447, 99 SCt 1861 (1979), the Supreme \nCourt considered for the first time the constitutionality of a jail’s strip search policy under the \nFourth Amendment.  Specifically, the court considered whether a jail’s blanket policy of \nperforming strip searches after a pretrial detainee had a contact visits was constitutional.   \nThe court initially noted that “a detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious \nsecurity dangers” where the “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all \ntoo common an occurrence.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Accordingly, the Court extended “wide-\nranging” deference to the decision making of jail officials, especially on matters concerning “the \nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve \ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”  Id. at 547, 559.   \nIn upholding the jail’s policy as constitutional, the Court cautioned that the “test for \nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical \nPage 9 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\napplication.”  Bell, at 559.  The Court established a test that requires “a balancing of the need for \nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  Courts must \nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Id. at 558. 5  \nThe Ninth Circuit has since applied the balancing test set forth in Bell v. Wolfish to a \nnumber of cases.  In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), cert denied, 471 U.S. 1053 \n(1985), the court considered the constitutionality of a county jail’s policy of strip searching \npersons booked into the county jail on minor traffic offenses.  In assessing the county’s strip \nsearch policy, the court balanced “the security needs of local jail facilities against the private \ninterests of arrestees charged with minor offenses.”  Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.    \nThe court, in concluding that the blanket strip search policy was unconstitutional, stated, \n“we hold that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subject to a strip search only if jail \nofficials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing \ncontraband.”  Id.  The court did provide guidance, however, in identifying factors sufficient to \nestablish reasonable suspicion.  “Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the \nnature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.”   Id. at \n618.   \nLater, in Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 713 (9th Cir. 1990),6 the \ncourt considered the Los Angeles Police Department’s blanket policy requiring all those arrested \non suspicion of having committed a felony to be subject to a strip search.  The plaintiff in \n                                                 \n5 Conversely, in Turner v. Safley, 482 US 78, 89 (1987), the Supreme Court employed a different \ntest,  holding  that “ when  a pr ison  regulation  impinges  on inmates ’  constitutional  rights, the \nregulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interest.”   \n \n6 Reversed on other grounds by Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 971 F.2d 298 (9th Cir 1992).   \nPage 10 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nKennedy was arrested on a grand theft felony charge for withholding her roommate’s personal \nproperty items as collateral for unpaid rent.    \nThe court held that the department’s blanket policy of strip searching all felony arrestees \nviolated the Fourth Amendment.  Significantly, the court found that the non-violent nature of the \nfelony charge did not constitute reasonable suspicion for the search.  Moreover, the \nDepartment’s strip search policies under review were particularly intrusive.7  The court \ncontinued by noting that the strip search of a felony arrestee for contraband or weapons may still \nbe justified based on a “reasonable suspicion” standard.8  Id. at 715.    \nThe inmate’s status within the custodial facility may also determine the precise \nparameters of the search.  The courts have “consistently recognized a distinction between \ndetainees awaiting bail and those entering the jail population when evaluating the necessity of a \nstrip search under constitutional standards.”  See Cottrell v. Kaysville City, Utah, 994 F.2d 730, \n735 (10th Cir. 1993); Fuller v. MG Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1448 (9th Cir. 1991); Logan v. \nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981).  For example, courts have upheld blanket strip \nsearch policies in prison settings.  See Michefelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. \n1988)(holding that frequent routine strip searches in maximum security unit were constitutional); \nRickman v. Avaniti, 854 F.2d 327 (9th Cir. 1988)(holding that prison’s blanket policy strip search \nwith visual body cavity inspection was constitutional); Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694 (9th \nCir. 1997)(holding that unannounced visual body cavity strip search based on drug disciplinary \n                                                 \n7 The Department’s policy was essentially a perfunctory body-cavity search of all felony arrestees.  \nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 711.     \n8 Interestingly, the court in Kennedy cited to Turner v. Safley, 482 US 78, 89 (1987), and implicitly \nendorsed the Turner court’s holding that the strip search policy must  be “reasonably related to the \npenal institution’s interest in maintaining security.”  Kennedy, at 713.    \nPage 11 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nhistory was constitutional).  Accordingly, the status of the individual subjected to the search is \nyet another aspect of the reasonable suspicion analysis.   \nThe reasonableness of the strip search is further based on the manner and place in which \nit is conducted, and the justifications for initiating it.  Bell, 441 US at 559.   The courts have held \nthat the scope of a strip search is “frightening and humiliating” despite “all due courtesy.”  Way, \n445 F.3d at 1160, quoting Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984).  The Multnomah \nCounty Sheriff’s Office is cognizant of the intrusive nature of the strip search.  To accommodate \nthose concerns, the County’s policy directs that all strip searches take place in a private area at \nMCDC, in a separate stalled area.9  In the present case, plaintiffs take no issue with the manner \nin which the strip searches were performed.   \nUnder Bell, the final inquiry is whether the intrusion was justified.  The reasonableness of \na particular search is determined by legitimate government interests such as “maintaining jail \nsecurity, and effective management of [the] detention facility.”  Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, \n933 (9th Cir. 2004).   In the present case, plaintiffs claim that they were each charged with \nmisdemeanor or minor crimes, and that those charges do not support the level of reasonable \nsuspicion required to perform the strip search.   The gravamen of plaintiffs’ claim, however, is \nthat the County has “a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all  \nindividuals who enter the custody of the Multnomah County Jail . . . regardless of the nature of \nthe charged crime.”   (Amended Complaint, ¶ 23).   Plaintiffs’ blanket-policy claim obviates the \nneed to evaluate each claim on a case-by case basis.  Accordingly, the particularized facts unique \n                                                 \n9 The portion of the policy pertaining to the manner the search is performed was amended in March \n22, 2004 by Special Order 04-08.  (Ex 102).     \nPage 12 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nto each plaintiff and the County’s resultant justification for conducting the strip search are not at \nissue.   \nPlaintiffs were not subjected to a strip search based on a blanket written or de facto \npolicy.  To the contrary, the County’s strip search policy is tailored to undertake strip searches \nonly in those situations when the deputies are presented with facts or circumstances – either \nhistorical or present – in which the arrestee or inmate presents with risk factors that may result in \nthe introduction of weapons or contraband in the secure jail facility.  Those facts, considered \ncollectively or standing alone, constitute the individualized level of reasonable suspicion to \njustify the strip search of the particular individual.   \nA search based on an individualized suspicion will pass constitutional muster if it is \nbased on an objectively reasonable belief that the particular inmate is carrying or concealing \ncontraband or weapons.  Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1447 (9th Cir. 1991).   \nReasonable suspicion may be based on a number of factors, such as the nature of the offense, the \narrestee’s appearance and conduct, and any prior arrest or criminal records.  Giles v. Ackerman, \n746 F.2d at 615 (emphasis added).    \nThe County’s strip search policy includes the factors that amount to reasonable suspicion.   \nThe enumerated bases to justify a strip search are factors that are incorporated in the County’s \nstrip search policies. These factors further a legitimate security interest, and weigh heavily in \nfavor of protecting the jail facility, its inmates, and staff from the perils associated with the \nintroduction of contraband and weapons.  “Reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment must \nafford police the right to strip search arrestees whose offenses posed the very threat of violence \nby weapons or contraband drugs that they must curtail in prison.”  Watt v. City of Richardson \nPage 13 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nPolice Dept, 849F.2d 195, 198 (5th Cir. 1988).    The County’s policy is reasonable.  Moreover, \nconsistent with the Supreme Court’s direction in Bell, deference should be given to law \nenforcement authorities when construing the strip search policies.  See also Block v. Rutherford, \n468 US 576, 584 (1984)(prison officials are to be afforded wide-ranging deference in adoption \nand exercise of policies to preserve internal order).    \nThe Ninth Circuit’s ruling in Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2006), \ndoes not alter the analysis or the outcome of the present case.   In Way, the Ninth Circuit held \nthat the strip search of a pre-trial detainee on a misdemeanor drug charge of visible intoxication \nwas unconstitutional.  The search was performed pursuant to the County’s blanket policy of \nperforming searches of all persons arrested on fresh misdemeanor drug charges.   \nWay is distinguishable and does not control the disposition of the present case.  First, the \nstrip search in Way was performed during the booking process on an arrestee facing a \nmisdemeanor charge of visible intoxication. The court found that there existed no facts to \nsupport reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, the arrestee was not processed and admitted into the \ngeneral jail population.  Rather, she was booked and then released.   See also Giles v. Ackerman, \n746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir. 1984)(suspicionless search during booking of individual arrested on \nminor traffic offenses violated Fourth Amendment).   Lastly, the court concluded that the policy \nfailed to be linked in any way to legitimate security concerns.  Way, 45 F.3d at 1161.   \nRecently, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a blanket policy of performing strip searches of all \ninmates classified into the general jail population was unconstitutional. Bull v. City and County \nof San Francisco, 2008 U.S. App LEXIS 18026 (August 22, 2008).  The court’s holding in Bull, \nhowever, does not alter the analysis or the outcome of the present case.   Specifically, the policy \nPage 14 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nat issue in Bull was described by the court as a “blanket policy of strip searching all individuals \nwho were classified for housing in the general jail population, regardless of the crime for which \nthey were charged.”  Id. at 4.  The court’s decision in Bull is perhaps the Ninth Circuit’s most \nfar-reaching ruling pertaining to strip searches.  As in most strip search cases, however, its \nholding is based on “case-specific circumstances.”   Id. at 17.   \nIn the present case, as discussed above, no such blanket policy of performing strip \nsearches exists.  Strip searches are performed based on individualized and case-specific factors \nset forth in the MCSO’s policies.  Moreover, the MCSO’s policies are designed to ensure the \nsafe and orderly operation of the facility and protect inmates and jail staff from the disruptions \nthat occur by the introduction into the jail of contraband or weapons.  The Ninth Circuit has \n“acknowledged the difficult security problems present in some local jail facilities,” and in \ndeference has recognized that the court is “not free to substitute our views on proper jail \nadministration for that of the jails’ actual administrators.”  Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (citing Block v. \nRutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984).  The MCSO’s policy of performing strip searches based on the \nexacting criteria enumerated by the courts does not violate the Fourth Amendment.    \nBecause Multnomah County does not have a written or de facto blanket strip search \npolicy, plaintiffs cannot meet their burden necessary to survive summary judgment.  \nAccordingly, defendants are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Consequently, the court \ndoes not need to consider the issue of qualified immunity or any claims brought pursuant to \nMonell v. Dep’t of Social Services, 436 US 658, 98 SCt 2018, 56 LEd 2d 611 (1978).  Aguilera \nv. Baca, 510 F.3d 1161, 1167 (9th Cir. 2007).    \nPage 15 – DEFENDANTS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nMultnomah County Attorneys \n501 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 500 \nPortland, Oregon 97214 \n(503) 988-3138 \n\nThe MCSO policy speaks for itself.  No genuine issue of material fact is in dispute. \nAccordingly, defendants Multnomah County and Sheriff Giusto are entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, defendants Multnomah County and Sheriff Giusto respectfully \nrequest that this Court grant Summary Judgment in defendants’ favor, and that plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint be dismissed with prejudice.   \n \nDATED this 3rd day of September, 2008.  \nAGNES SOWLE, COUNTY ATTORNEY \nFOR MULTNOMAH COUNTY, OREGON \n \n \ns/ Stephen L.
