      "title": "Class Action Complaint",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTFUCT OF OREGON \nDARRELL ROLLINS, \nboth individually and on behalf of a class of : \nothers similarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nCivil Action Number \nv. \nCLATSOP COUNTY, \nTOM BERGIN, \nboth individually and in his \nofficial capacity as Sheriff, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nDefendants. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured \nto the Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates of America.  For at least the past several years, the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department \nhas had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Clatsop County Jail and are \nplaced in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged.  Upon information \nand belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Clatsop County \nSheriffs  Department,  and  was  promulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically, \nDefendant Tom Bergin. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that \nthey possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial District, as well as \n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, have recently held that blanket strip \nsearch policies/practices like those in dispute in this case are unconstitutional.  In short, the \npolicy of Clatsop County and the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department of forcing those charged \nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Clatsop County \nJail is not only clearly illegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary. \nDarrell  Rollins brings this  action on behalf  of himself, and on behalf  of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate \nthe clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class members he proposes \nto  represent.  Mr.  Rollins was taken  in  on allegations of  Resisting Arrest.  Mr. Rollins was \ntransported to the Clatsop County Jail and was subjected to a strip search, in violation of his right \nagainst unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nHe seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed class, a declaration \nthat  the  Sheriffs  Department's  policies/practices  are  unconstitutional,  and  an  injunction \nprecluding Clatsop County and the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department from continuing to \nviolate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Darrell \nRollins, through counsel, hereby complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction  over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.  $5 \n133 1, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 55 1981 & 1983. \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 8 2201, as it is \n\nfiled  to  obtain  declaratory  relief  relative  to  the Constitutionality of the policies  of  a  local \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue  is proper  under 28 U.S.C.  8  1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiff's claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Darrell Rollins (\"Rollins\")  resides in Wahkiakum County, Washington.  On \nor  about. November  20,  2005,  he was housed  at the  Clatsop  County Jail  for  allegation  of \nResisting Arrest. \n4.  Defendant Clatsop County (the \"County\")  is a county government organized and \nexisting under the laws of the State of Oregon.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting \nthrough  its  Sheriffs  Department,  was  responsible  for  the  policies,  practices,  supervision, \nimplementation  and  conduct  of  all matters  pertaining  to  the  Clatsop  County  Jail  and  was \nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Department \npersonnel. including those working in the Clatsop County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant times, \nthe County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Clatsop County Jail, and for ensuring \nthat Sheriffs Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and of the State of Oregon. \n5.  The Clatsop County Sheriffs Department (the \"Sheriffs Department\")  is a County \nSheriffs Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon. At all times \nrelevant hereto, the Sheriffs Department was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing \nand administering the Clatsop County Jail (\"CTCJ\").  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant \nSheriff  Department, together with Clatsop County was responsible for the polices, practices, \n:j \n\nsupervision,  implementation and  conduct  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  CTCJ,  and  was \nresponsilble for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Department \npersonnel, including those  working in the  CTCJ.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, \nDefendant Sheriffs Department, together with Clatsop County, was responsible for enforcing \nthe  rules of the  Clatsop County Jail, and  for ensuring that  Sheriffs Department personnel \nemployed in the CTCJ obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of \nOregon. \n61.  Defendant Tom Bergin is the duly elected Sheriff of Clatsop County, and, as such, is \na policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the CTCJ \nexercises custodial or other control. Sheriff Bergin is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities. \n7.  Sheriff Bergin will be referred to as the \"Policy Making Defendant.\" \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of  Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly  situated \nindividuials who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Clatsop County Jail. \n9.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Clatsop \nCounty Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of \nprobation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor \ncrimes and were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the Clatsop \nCounty  Jail pursuant to  the policy,  custom and practice  of the  Clatsop \nCounty  Sheriffs  Department  and  Clatsop  County.  The  class  period \ncommences on November 8, 2005 and extends to the date on which the \nClatsop  County  Sheriffs Department and/or  the  County of  Clatsop  are \nenjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, \npractice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall  of  their  respective  affiliates,  legal representatives,  heirs,  successors, \nemployees or assignees. \n10. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n1 I. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  Upon \ninformation and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and violations \nwho are placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail every month  all of whom are \n- \nmembers of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class \ntotals at least 1,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple \noccasions. \n\n12. Upon  information  and belief, joinder  of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause  of  the  large  number  of  class members  and the  fact that  class rrsmbers  are likely \ndispersed over a large  geographical area, with  some members presently residing outside of \nClatsop County  and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n13. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they \nall had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' conducting strip \nsearches  absent  particularized  suspicion.  All  members  of  the  class  were  charged  with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail, and all \nwere illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit. \n14. Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff and \nall members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' course of conduct.  The \nharms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n15. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff has no interests \nthat are (adverset o the interests of the members of the Class. \n16. Plaintiff  has  retained counsel who has  substantial experience and  success  in the \nprosecution of civil rights litigation. \n17. Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or between \ncounsel and members of the class. \n118. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks c1,ass certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \n\nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail.  In short, the County of \nClatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Clatsop \nCounty Corrections Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n19. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n20. Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  exist  as to  all  members  of  the  Class,  and \npredominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only  individual  members of the  Class.  These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policylpractice of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Clatsop County \nJail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period. \n211. A  class  action  is  superior to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder  of all of the individual members of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expensc to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n\n22. Upon  information  and belief,  there  are no  other  actions pending to  address the \nDefendaints'  flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefenda:nts have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several years. \n23. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also seeks \npartial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n24. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits  state officials, \nsuch as tlne Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing \na weapon or contraband. \n25. Upon information and belief, the County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriffs \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de jacto  policy, \ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Clatsop County \nJail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies and/or \nforcing lhem to  submit to a visual inspection of their body cavities) and are placed into jail \nclothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of \nthis Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n26. The County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy \nor  practice  of  conducting  strip  searches without  particularized,  reasonable  suspicion.  This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle \nbeing clearly established in Kennedy v. Los Angeles P. D., 901 F2d 702, 7 11 , (9thC  ir. 1990). \n\n27. The  Defendants'  written  andlor  de facto policy,  practice  and  custom  mandating \nwholesalle  strip  searches of  all misdemeanor  and violation  arrestees has been  promulgated, \neffectualed and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n28. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the particular \ncircumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the particular \ncharacteristics of the arrestees, andlor the circumstances of the arrest. \n2:9. Upon information and belief, the County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriffs \nDepartment and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, andlor \nfailed to  rectify  a written  andlor de facto policy,  practice  or  custom of  strip  searching all \nindividuals placed  into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail and placed into jail  clothing \nwithout any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of \nthe offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest \nwere relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches. \n30. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, including \nthe named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the Clatsop \nCounty Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable \nsuspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted \nfor  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other  innocuous  offenses,  Driving  While  Intoxicated, \nHarassment and Trespassing. \n3 1. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to \nthis written and/or de jucto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - each member of \n\nthe  class,  including  the  named  Plaintiff  - has  suffered  or  will  suffer  psychological  pain, \nhumiliatiion, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Rollins (Clatsop County) \n32. Mr. Darrell Rollins's experience is representative of the class at large.  On November \n20, 2005., Mr. Rollins was strip and cavity searched in the Clatsop County Jail. \n3 3. Mr. Rollins was moved into a shower area in the Clatsop County Jail and ordered to \ndisrobe.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Mr. Rollins removed all of his clothing, including his \nunderpants. \n34. A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Rollins to lift his testicles, turn around, \nbend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while coughing, with the Corrections \nOfficer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Rollins' genitals and rectal cavity.  Mr. Rollins was \nthen provided with a jail uniform after taking a shower. \n35. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. \nRollins was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. \nRollins that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. \n36. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to \nCounty and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Rollins has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- \nUnreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law -- \n37. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated in \nparagraplhs 1 through 37. \n38. The  Fourth  Amendment of the United  States Constitution protects  citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches of  individuals  arrested for  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent  some particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n39. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the United \nStates  Constitution.  Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for  Clatsop  County \nCorrections  Officers to  strip  search Plaintiff  and class members  based  on their  arrests  for \nmisdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to orderldirect Clatsop County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches. \n40. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department.  As such, the County of Clatsop \nis directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n4.1. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff Bergin  is  responsible  for  establishing  the \npolicies  and  procedures  to  be  utilized  in the  operation  of  the  Clatsop  County  Jail,  and  is \nresponsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nRoberts is individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass. \n\n42. Sheriff  Bergin  knew  that  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted  willfully, \nknowing,ly. and with  specific intent to  deprive Plaintiff  and members of the Class of their \nConstitutional rights. \n43. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n4.4. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiff \nand members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--  -- \nDemand for Declaratory Judgment \n45. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 44. \n46. The policy, custom and practice of the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department, the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directinglconducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Clats'op County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons. \n47. Plaintiff  and  members  of  the  Class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a  declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Clatsop and the Clatsop \nCounty Sheriffs Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--  -- \nDemand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction \n4.8. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 48. \n4.9. The policy, custom and practice of the Clatsop County Sheriffs Department, the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directinglconducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Clatsop County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons. \n\n50. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Clatsop County \nJail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have \nalready been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n5 1. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes will \ncause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy \nfor which does not exist at law. \n52. Plaintiff  demands  that  the  County  of  Clatsop,  the  Clatsop  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Clatsop  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmedialtely desist  from strip searching  individuals placed  into the  custody  of the  Clatsop \nCounty Jail  absent  any particularized  suspicion that the  individuals in  question have  either \ncontraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court \nordering as much. \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n53. The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that their \nactions are unconstitutional. \n54. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Clatsop and the Clatsop \nCounty Sheriffs Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual citizens or for the \nrule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy \nMaking Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of the United States \nConstitution also apply to government officials in Clatsop County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n55. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Darrell Rollins, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a class of \nothers similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant him the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs First Cause of \nAction detailed herein,  awarding Compensatory Damages to  each named Plaintiff  and each \nmember of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury and/or the Court on both \nan individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  Bergin  on  Plaintiffs  First  Cause  of  Action  for \n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \n\nD.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Clatsop and \nthe Clatslop County Sheriffs Department's policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity \nsearching all detainees entering the Clatsop County Jail, regardless of the crime charged or \nsuspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to \nstrip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the  search  is  concealing \nweapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney's  fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. 5 1988 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 \nI \nRespectfully submitted by: \n,- \nDated: November 8, 2007 \nLeonard R.

COMPLAINT \n    :  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n      Defendants.    : \n____________________________________:  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured \nto the Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United \nStates of America.  For at least the past several years, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department \nhas had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Clatsop County Jail and are \nplaced in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged.  Upon information \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  1 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 2 of 23    Page ID#: 68\nand belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Clatsop County \nSheriff’s  Department,  and  was  promulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically, \nDefendant Tom Bergin. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that \nthey possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial District, as well as \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, have recently held that blanket strip \nsearch policies/practices like those in dispute in this case are unconstitutional.  In short, the \npolicy of Clatsop County and the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department of forcing those charged \nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Clatsop County \nJail is not only clearly illegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary.  \n  Darrell  Rollins,  Debbi  Davis,  Tyler  King,  Noel  Leroux,  David  Menken,  Stephen \nSchwanbeck,  and Brandi Stephens bring this action on behalf of themselves,  and on behalf of a \nclass of thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class members he \nproposes to represent. Mr. Rollins was taken in on allegations of Resisting Arrest. Mr. Rollins \nwas transported to the Clatsop County Jail and was subjected to a strip search, in violation of his \nright  against  unreasonable  searches  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution.  He seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed class, a \ndeclaration  that  the  Sheriff’s  Department’s  policies/practices  are  unconstitutional,  and  an \ninjunction  precluding  Clatsop  County  and  the  Clatsop  County  Sheriff’s  Department  from \ncontinuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, \nPlaintiff Darrell Rollins, et al through counsel, hereby complains as follows: \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 3 of 23    Page ID#: 69\n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled  to  obtain  declaratory relief  relative  to  the  Constitutionality  of  the  policies  of  a local \ngovernment. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Darrell Rollins (“Rollins”) resides in Wahkiakum County, Oregon.  On or \nabout November 20, 2005, he was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for allegation of Resisting \nArrest.  \n4.  Plaintiff Debbi Davis (“Davis”) resides in  Clatsop County, Oregon.  On or about \nApril  18,  2008,  she  was  housed  at  the  Clatsop  County  Jail  for  allegation  of  Hindering \nProsecution. \n5.  Plaintiff Brandi Stephens (“Stephens”) resides in Clatsop County, Oregon.  On or \nabout March 17, 2006, she was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for being a fugitive on DUI \nand Theft charges. \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  3 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 4 of 23    Page ID#: 70\n6.  Plaintiff Tyler King (“King”) resides in Snohomish County, Washington.  On or \nabout June 16, 2006, he was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for allegation of a fugitive \nwarrant for Assault 2 and Endangering Children. \n7.  Plaintiff Noel Leroux (“Leroux”) resides inClatsop County, Oregon.  On or about \nJanuary 19, 2008, he was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for allegation of DUI. \n8.  Plaintiff David Menken (“Menken”) resides in Clatsop County, Oregon.  On or about \nFebruary t, 2006, he was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for allegation of Resisting Arrest.  \n9.  Plaintiff Stephen Schwanbeck (“Schwanbeck”) resides in Clatsop County, Oregon.  \nOn or about September 21, 2006, he was housed at the Clatsop County Jail for allegation of  \nDUI.  \n10. Defendant Clatsop County (the “County”) is a county government organized and \nexisting under the laws of the State of Oregon.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting \nthrough  its  Sheriff’s  Department,  was  responsible  for  the  policies,  practices,  supervision, \nimplementation  and  conduct  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  Clatsop  County  Jail  and  was \nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel, including those working in the Clatsop County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant times, \nthe County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Clatsop County Jail, and for ensuring \nthat Sheriff’s Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and of the State of Oregon. \n11. The Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is a County \nSheriff’s Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon. At all times \nrelevant hereto, the Sheriff’s Department was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing \nand administering the Clatsop County Jail (“CTCJ”).  At all times relevant hereto, Defendant \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  4 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 5 of 23    Page ID#: 71\nSheriff’s Department, together with Clatsop County was responsible for the polices, practices, \nsupervision,  implementation  and  conduct  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  CTCJ,  and  was \nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel, including those working in the CTCJ.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, \nDefendant Sheriff’s Department, together with Clatsop County, was responsible for enforcing \nthe rules of the Clatsop County Jail,  and for ensuring that Sheriff’s Department personnel \nemployed in the CTCJ obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of \nOregon. \n12. Defendant Tom Bergin is the duly elected Sheriff of Clatsop County, and, as such, is \na policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the CTCJ \nexercises custodial or other control. Sheriff Bergin is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities. \n13.   Sheriff Bergin will be referred to as the “Policy Making Defendant.” \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  5 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 6 of 23    Page ID#: 72\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n14. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip searched upon \ntheir entry into the Clatsop County Jail. \n15. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the Clatsop \nCounty Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, violations of \nprobation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other minor \ncrimes and were or will be strip searched upon their entry into the Clatsop \nCounty Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Clatsop \nCounty  Sheriff’s  Department  and  Clatsop  County.    The  class  period \ncommences on November 8, 2005 and extends to the date on which the \nClatsop County Sheriff’s Department  and/or the County of Clatsop are \nenjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, \npractice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip  searches  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall  of  their  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors, \nemployees or assignees.   \n \n16. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n17. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  Upon \ninformation and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and violations \nwho are placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail every month – all of whom are \nmembers of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class \ntotals at least 1,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple \noccasions. \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 7 of 23    Page ID#: 73\n18. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of \nClatsop County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n19. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that they \nall had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ conducting strip \nsearches  absent  particularized  suspicion.    All  members  of  the  class  were  charged  with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail, and all \nwere illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit. \n20. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff and \nall members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ course of conduct.  The \nharms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n21. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff has no interests \nthat are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n22. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has  substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of civil rights litigation.  \n23. Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts among members of the class, or between \ncounsel and members of the class. \n24. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 8 of 23    Page ID#: 74\nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or \nminor crimes and placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail.  In short, the County of \nClatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Clatsop  \nCounty Corrections Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n25. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n26. Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  exist  as  to  all  members  of  the  Class,  and \npredominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only  individual  members  of  the  Class.    These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy/practice of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Clatsop County \nJail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period. \n27. A  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 9 of 23    Page ID#: 75\n28. Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  no  other  actions  pending  to  address  the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several years. \n29. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also seek \npartial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 10 of 23    Page ID#: 76\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n30. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing \na weapon or contraband. \n31. Upon information and belief, the County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Clatsop County \nJail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies and/or \nforcing them to submit to a visual inspection of their body cavities) and are placed into jail \nclothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of \nthis Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n32. The County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy \nor  practice  of  conducting  strip  searches  without  particularized, reasonable  suspicion.    This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle \nbeing clearly established in Kennedy v. Los Angeles P.D., 901 F2d 702, 711, (9th Cir. 1990). \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 11 of 23    Page ID#: 77\n33. The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom  mandating \nwholesale  strip searches of  all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n34. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the particular \ncircumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the particular \ncharacteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n35. Upon information and belief, the County of Clatsop, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s \nDepartment and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or \nfailed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Clatsop County Jail and placed into jail clothing \nwithout any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of \nthe offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest \nwere relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n36. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, including \nthe named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry into the Clatsop \nCounty Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable \nsuspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip searches are conducted \nfor  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other  innocuous  offenses,  Driving  While  Intoxicated, \nHarassment and Trespassing. \n37. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to \nthis written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – each member of \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 12 of 23    Page ID#: 78\nthe  class,  including  the  named  Plaintiffs  –  has  suffered  or  will  suffer  psychological  pain, \nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Rollins  \n38. Mr. Darrell Rollins’s experience is representative of the class at large.  On November \n20, 2005,  Mr. Rollins was strip and cavity searched in the Clatsop County Jail. \n39. Mr. Rollins was moved into a shower area in the Clatsop County Jail and ordered to \ndisrobe.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Mr. Rollins removed all of his clothing, including his \nunderpants.   \n40.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Rollins to lift his testicles, turn around, \nbend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while coughing, with the Corrections \nOfficer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Rollins’ genitals and rectal cavity.  Mr. Rollins was \nthen provided with a jail uniform after taking a shower.  \n41. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. \nRollins was concealing a weapon or other contraband.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realleg each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 74. \n76. The Fourth Amendment of the United States  Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches  of  individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent  some  particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n77. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff’s rights under the United \nStates  Constitution.    Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for  Clatsop  County \nCorrections  Officers  to  strip  search  Plaintiff  and  class  members  based  on  their  arrests  for \nmisdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to order/direct Clatsop County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.   \n78. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department.  As such, the County of Clatsop \nis directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n79. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Bergin  is  responsible  for  establishing  the \npolicies  and  procedures  to  be  utilized  in  the  operation  of  the  Clatsop  County  Jail,  and  is \nresponsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, \nRoberts is individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the \nClass.    \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  18 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 19 of 23    Page ID#: 85\n80. Sheriff  Bergin  knew  that  strip  search  policy  was  illegal,  and  acted  willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the Class of their \nConstitutional rights. \n81. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n82. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiff \nand members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  19 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 20 of 23    Page ID#: 86\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n \n83. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 82. \n84. The policy, custom and practice of the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department, the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Clatsop County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons. \n85. Plaintiff  and  members  of  the  Class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a  declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Clatsop and the Clatsop \nCounty Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \n \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n86. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nparagraphs 1 through 85. \n87. The policy, custom and practice of the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department, the \nCounty of Clatsop and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Clatsop County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons. \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  20 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 21 of 23    Page ID#: 87\n88. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Clatsop County \nJail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have \nalready been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff.   \n89. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes will \ncause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy \nfor which does not exist at law. \n90. Plaintiff  demands  that  the  County  of  Clatsop,  the  Clatsop  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Clatsop  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the  Clatsop \nCounty Jail absent  any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court \nordering as much. \n \n \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  21 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 22 of 23    Page ID#: 88\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n91.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that they \ncontinue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that their \nactions are unconstitutional. \n92. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Clatsop and the Clatsop \nCounty Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual citizens or for the \nrule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy \nMaking Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of the United States \nConstitution also apply to government officials in Clatsop County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n93. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Darrell Rollins et al, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of a \nclass of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following \nrelief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs’ First Cause of \nAction detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to each named Plaintiff and each \nmember of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury and/or the Court on both \nan individual and a class wide basis.  \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  22 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-01678-KI    Document 16    Filed 09/18/08    Page 23 of 23    Page ID#: 89\nC.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  Bergin  on  Plaintiff’s  First  Cause  of  Action  for \n$1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Clatsop and \nthe Clatsop County Sheriff’s Department’s policy, practice and custom of strip and visual cavity \nsearching all detainees entering the Clatsop County Jail, regardless of the crime charged or \nsuspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nE.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to \nstrip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the  search  is  concealing \nweapons or other contraband. \nF.  A monetary award for attorney’s fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ.
