    "summary": "<p>On September 1, 1987, a group of children under the age of 16 who were non-delinquent status offenders, filed this class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and the Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act against the State of Connecticut in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, and they alleged that the defendants had violated their rights by unlawfully holding them in secure juvenile detention facilities, despite the fact that they were non-delinquent out-of-state juvenile runaways.  The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>On October 9, 1987, the district court (Judge Alan Nevas) certified the plaintiff class.  On February 2, 1988, the court approved a consent decree that had been agreed upon by both sides.  Under the terms of the decree, the defendants agreed that they would no longer deliver non-delinquent juvenile runaways to secure juvenile detention facilities.  They also agreed that if a member of the plaintiff class was delivered by any party to a secure detention facility, they would pick them up from that facility within 6 hours.  They agreed that if a member of the plaintiff class wanted to return to their home state to be with their parent or guardian, but they (and their parent/guardian) lacked the finances to return them to that state, the defendants would file a petition for the child's return under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles.</p><p>On July 7, 1988, the court dismissed the case.</p><p></p>",

The parties herein agree to the follow-\ning provisions:\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n1. This class action was filed September 1, 1987 by Jane\nDoe, a minor by and through her n~~t friend John Doe and by\nElizabeth Doe, a minor by and through her next friend, Brian\nCarlow.\n2. This action challenges defendants' policy and practice\nof detaining out-of-state nondelinquent juvenile runaways in\nsecure juvenile facilities in Connecticut.\n3. Though plaintiffs allege that such detention violates\ntheir federal constitutional and statutory rights, defendants do\nnot admit nor is there a finding that the statutes pursuant to\nwhich such secure detention is allowed, i.e., Conn. Gen. Stat.\n§§ 46b-149(e), 46b-149a, 17-75 et seq., are violative of plain \ntiffs' rights under the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and the Juvenile\nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. §\n5633(a)(12)(A). Plaintiffs reserve the right t~ challenge the\nlegality of these statutes should any member of the plaintiff\nclass be admitted to a secure juvenile facility. Defendants\nreserve all defenses to this action.\n-2-\n\n4. The parties have discussed settlement of the claims in\nthis action and have entered into this agreement for the purpose\nof resolving their dispute.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\n1. Plaintiffs, children under the age of sixteen who are\nnondelinquent status offenders, bring this action to enjoin state\nofficials from incarcerating them in highly secure state juvenile\ndetention facilities merely because they have run away to\nConnecticut from some other state and are subject to the Interstate\nCompact on Juveniles. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive\nrelief challenging C.G.S. §46-149(e), C.G.S. §46b-149a and C.G.S.\n§17-76 on their face and as applied as violative of plaintiffs'\nrights under the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution, the Juvenile Justice Delinquency and\nPrevention Act, 42 U.S.C. §5633(a)(12)(A) (hereinafter \"JJDPA\"), and\n42 U.S.C. §1983.\nII.

She brings this case by her next\nfriend, Brian Carlow.\nDefendants:\n7. Defendant Anthony Milano is and at all times pertinent\nherein has been Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management\n(hereinafter \"OPM\"). Pursuant to C.G.S. §4-65a(a), he is responsible\nfor the management and supervision of the state budget including\nfederal grants received by Connecticut under the JJDPA, 42 U.S.C.\n§5601 et ~., and for juvenile justice planning within the State of\nConnecticut. He is sued in his official capacity.\n8. Defendant John Herrington is and at all times pertinent\n-\nherein has been Supervisor of the HJDC. In this capacity,he is\nresponsible for the day to day care and custody of all juveniles\ndetained at the HJDC. He is sued in his official capacity.\n\n- 3 -\n9. Defendant John Borys is and at all times pertinent herein\nhas been Deputy Director of Juvenile Matters, Superior Court,\nHartford, Connecticut. He is responsible for overseeing the care\nand custody of juveniles at Connecticut's three juvenile detention\ncenters and for reporting to defendant Milano the extent of\ncompliance with that portion of the JJDPA which bars the housing of\naccused and adjudicated status offenders in secure detention or\ncorrectional facilities. 42 U.S.C. §5633(a)(12)(A). He is sued in\nhis official capacity.\n10. Defendant Amy Wheaton is and at all times pertinent herein\nhas been Commissioner of the Department of Children and Youth\nServices (hereinafter \"DCYS\"). Pursuant to C.G.S. §17-415(k), she\nis responsible for acting as administrator of the Interstate Compact\non Juveniles established by C.G.S. §17-76 et ~., having been so\ndesignated by the governor in accordance with C.G.S. §17-77. She is\nalso empowered, pursuant to C.G.S. §46b-120, C.G.S. §46b-149 and\nC.G.S. §17-415(a), to provide services to \"families with service\nneeds,\" which families are defined to include families with children\nunder sixteen years of age who have run away. She is sued in her\nofficial capacity.\n11. Defendant Richard Adamick is a member of the Newington\nPolice Department who, pursuant to C.G.S. §46b-149a, is authorized\nto transport children to the HJDC under the Interstate Compact on\nJuveniles, C.G.S. §17-75 et ~.\n\n- 4 -\nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n12. This action is brought as a class action pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(1) and (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n13. Plaintiffs file this complaint on behalf of themselves and\nall others similarly situated and seek equitable and declaratory\nrelief for the unconstitutional acts of defendants in holding\nnondelinquent juvenile runaways from out-of-state in secure juvenile\ndetention facilities.\n14. The named plaintiffs, Jane Doe and Elizabeth Doe, are\nfourteen year-old children presently incarcerated at the HJDC\npursuant to C.G.S. §46b-149, C.G.S. §46b-149a, and C.G.S. §17-76.\n15. The class plaintiffs seek to represent is composed of all\nnondelinquent children under sixteen years of age who are\nincarcerated by defendants in secure juvenile detention centers\nmerely because they have run away to Connecticut from other states.\n16. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nboth impracticable and impossible. Because juvenile runaways enter\nand leave the State of Connecticut on a daily basis, there is\nconstant fluctuation in the composition and number comprising the\nplaintiff class.\n17. There are questions of law and fact common to the members\nof plaintiff class in that:\n\n- 5 -\na. All members of the class have been or are being deprived\nof rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Ninth and Fourteenth\nu.s.c.\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, the JJDPA, 42\n§5633(a)(12)(A), and 42 U.S.C. §1983.\nb. The claims of the named plaintiffs are representative of\nthe claims presented by the class as a whole, for they have been\ndenied all the rights which have been or may be denied the entire\nclass.\nc. All members of the plaintiff class seek injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief to prevent future violations of their statutory\nand constitutional rights.\n18. The claims of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims of the class in that the constitutional and statutory\ndeprivations caused by defendants and claimed by the named\nplaintiffs are the same as for all other members of the class. The\nnamed plaintiffs, like all other class members, are nondelinquent\nchildren under the age of sixteen who seek to be free from the\nillegal actions of defendants in confining them in a secure juvenile\ndetention center.\n19. The representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class. The named plaintiffs have no\ninterests antagonistic to the class. Further all plaintiffs are\nrepresented by attorneys experienced in federal constitutional\nlitigation.\n\n- 6 -\n20. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members\nof the classes would create a risk of inconsistent or varying\nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class which\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties\nopposing the class.\n21. Defendants have consistently acted and refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class. Thus, final injunctive\nand declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole will be\nappropriate.\nv.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n22. Plaintiff Jane Doe is a fourteen year old juvenile who,\nuntil recently, resided with her mother in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n23. In March 1977, plaintiff Jane Doe's parents, who resided in\nConnecticut at the time, were divorced. Custody was awarded to\nplaintiff Doe's mother by the Superior Court, Hartford, Connecticut,\nsubject to reasonable visitation by the father.\n24. Plaintiff Jane Doe's father, John Doe, presently resides in\nNewington, connecticut with plaintiff Doe's grandmother and\nplaintiff Doe's brother.\n25. On or about August 12, 1987, because of repeated\ndisagreements with her mother, plaintiff Jane Doe left her mother's\nhome without her mother's knowledge or permission and ran away to\nher father's home in Newington, Connecticut.\n\n- 7 -\n26. John Doe willingly accepted plaintiff Jane Doe into his\nhome and began to provide a warm, loving environment for his\ndaughter.\n27. On August 15, 1987, after reporting her daughter missing to\npolice, plaintiff Doe's mother learned of her daughter's\nwhereabouts. This information was immediately transmitted to\nmembers of the Newington Police Department.\n28. On that date, plaintiff Jane Doe was taken into custody as\na runaway by defendant Adamick, an officer of the Newington Police\nDepartment. Defendant Adamick was acting pursuant to C.G.S.\nS46b-149a and C.G.S. S17-76 the Interstate Compact on Juveniles,\nj\nwhich authorizes the holding of a juvenile by Connecticut\nauthorities pending the forwarding of proper requisition papers by\nthe state of origin. Plaintiff Jane Doe was thereafter transported\nby the Newington Police to the HJDC pursuant to C.G.S. S46b-149(e)\nwhich has been interpreted by defendants to allow status offenders\nsuch as plaintiff Doe to be incarcerated in one of the state's three\njuvenile detention facilities.\n29. Upon plaintiff Jane Doe's arrest, John Doe, her father,\nsought to obtain legal custody of plaintiff Jane Doe from his former\nwife. On August 17, 1987, Superior Court JUdge Mary Aspell issued\nan order of temporary custody granting John Doe temporary\nguardianship over plaintiff Doe and allowing plaintiff Doe to stay\n\n- 8 -\nwith her father while formal motions to change custody, from her\nmother to her father, filed August 17, 1987, are heard and\nadjudicated.\n30. Despite this Order, plaintiff Jane Doe currently remains\nincarcerated at the HJDC, having been ordered to remain there by an\nOrder issued by a Superior Court Judge for Juvenile Matters, Judge\nFrederica Brenneman, until a formal hearing pursuant to the\nInterstate Compact on Juveniles is held.\n31. Plaintiff Jane Doe remains incarcerated at HJDC, a locked,\nsecure facility, although she has neither committed nor been charged\nwith committing any criminal offense, nor violated any valid court\norder directed against her.\n32. Plaintiff Elizabeth Doe is a fourteen year old child who is\npresently incarcerated at HJDC as an out-of-state runaway. She is\nheld there pursuant to C.G.S. §§46-149(e) and C.G.S. §17-76, the\nInterstate Compact on Juveniles.\n33. Prior to her incarceration at HJDC, plaintiff Elizabeth Doe\nhad been living in California at the Orangewood Home, a temporary\nshelter for abandoned, abused and neglected children. There is\npresently pending in California a petition of neglect against her\nfather, alleging child abuse.\n\n- 9 -\n34. Plaintiff Elizabeth Doe, at the time of her arrest in\nConnecticut, had not been adjudicated a delinquent either in\nConnecticut or in California.\n35. Defendant Herrington, as Supervisor of the HJDC, supervises\nthe incarceration of children confined therein, including children\nwho are charged with delinquent acts, children adjudicated to be\ndelinquent and awaiting disposition, children who have escaped from\nLong Lane School and are awaiting return there, as well as children,\nsuch as plaintiffs, who are neither charged with nor convicted of\ndelinquent acts but who merely are out-of-state runaways.\n36. Defendant Borys, as Deputy Director of Juvenile Matters,\noversees the care and custody of juveniles at HJDC and the state's\nother two juvenile detention facilities.\n37. The HJDC is a highly secure, regimented institution which\nis similar in many respects to an adult jail.\n38. 'rhe outside doors of the HJDC are locked twenty-four hours\na day. Children, including plaintiffs, are not free to leave the\nbuilding except to go to Court or to other professional appointments\nsuch as for emergency medical treatment and only under escort.\n39. The individual rooms within the facility in which\ndefendants Herrington and Borys incarcerate plaintiffs and others\n\n- 10 -\nsimilarly situated are small and sparsely furnished. The windows\nwithin the rooms cannot be opened from the inside. At various times\nduring the day and at night, plaintiffs are routinely locked in\ntheir rooms in solitary confinement.\n40. Plaintiffs are not allowed to have pens or pencils in these\nrooms. The only items allowed are two books and one set of pajamas.\n41. Plaintiffs and others similarly situated rarely are allowed\noutside. Most of their time is spent in large communal rooms\nwatching TV or playing pingpong.\n42. The temperature in the communal and individual rooms has\nbeen extremely cold. This problem is exacerbated due to defendants\nHerrington and Borys policy of not allowing children in detention to\nwear shoes, sneakers, hats or jackets.\n43. During the current summer months, there is no school\nprogram at the HJDC. When school is scheduled, it consists of only\napproximately thirty-five to forty minutes of tutoring each day.\n44. Visitation for plaintiffs is severely restricted. They are\npermitted to visit only with parents, lawyers, clergy and probation\nofficers. Parents are allowed only during regular visiting hours\nwhich is one hour per day on weekdays and one hour per day on the\nweek-end at the discretion of officials at HJDC. They are not\nallowed to visit with siblings or friends except in extraordinary\n\n- 11 -\ncircumstances. Limited phone calls are allowed to parents, lawyers,\nclergy and probation officers. Other calls are at the discretion of\nthe HJDC.\n45. Plaintiffs have received no individual therapy or\ncounseling from any professional staff on a regular basis since they\nhave been there.\n46. There have been assaults at the facility and some children\nhave made suicidal gestures because of the extreme anxiety they feel\nwhen incarcerated at HJDC.\n47. In 1980, the Connecticut General Assembly enacted \"Families\nwith Service Needs\" legislation, C.G.S. S46b-149, in part to\ndeinstitutionalize status offenders such as plaintiffs and thereby\nbring the State of Connecticut into compliance with the JJDPA which\nrequires that status offenders not be housed in secure detention or\ncorrectional facilities.\n48. Defendant Anthony Milano, as Secretary of OPM, is\nresponsible for the supervision and management of those federal\nmonies disbursed to Connecticut under the JJDPA.\n49. Defendant Milano continues to receive federal funds\npursuant to the JJDPA, but fails to report and prevent the\ncommingling of interstate compact runaways with juvenile delinquents\nas required by JJDPA.\n\n- 12 -\n50. Children who run away within the State of Connecticut are\ntreated differently and more favorably than children, such as\nplaintiffs, who run away into Connecticut from out-of-state although\nboth categories of runaways are status offenders. An intrastate\nrunaway can, inter alia, be referred to defendant Wheaton for any\nvoluntary services provided by DCYS, be committed to the custody of\ndefendant Wheaton, Commissioner of DCYS, pursuant to C.G.S.\n§46b-148, and be placed in his or her own home, in the custody of a\nrelative or in shelter facilities or homes which are not secure, but\nmay not in any circumstance, be housed in a secure detention\nfacility like HJDC.\n51. The shelters in which interstate runaways can be placed are\nstaffed with persons who are specially trained to provide\ncounselling services to such youth until the problems in their\nliving arrangements can be resolved.\n52. The only two groups of status offenders, exempted by state\nstatute from the protections afforded Connecticut status offenders\nto be free of detention in secure facilities are those, like\nplaintiffs, who are detained under the Interstate Compact on\nJuveniles, C.G.S. §17-76, and those who have violated a court order\nspecifically directed at them, C.G.S. §46b-148. Even under C.G.S.\n§46b-148(b), those juveniles who violate court orders can be\ndetained only if a hearing occurs within seventy-two hours\n(excluding weekends and holidays) and there is a judicial\ndetermination that there is no less restrictive alternative.\n\n- 13 -\n53. The incarceration of status offenders such as plaintiffs in\nthe same detention centers as children who are alleged or\nadjudicated as delinquent for criminal acts, punishes rather than\ntreats the child and is not in the best interest of a child from a\nfamily with service needs.\n54. Plaintiffs and others similarly situated are currently\nsuffering irreparable injury and have no adequate remedy at law.\nVI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - Equal Protection\n55. The allegations of paragraphs one through fifty-four are\nincorporated by reference, as though pleaded herein in full.\n56. C.G.S. §46b-149(e), C.G.S. §46b-149a and C.G.S. §§17-75\nthrough 17-81 as written and as here applied by defendants to\nauthorize the detention of plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff\nclass of nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways in secure\ndetention facilities violate the rights of plaintiffs to equal\nprotection of the law in that:\na. nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways are confined\nin secure detention facilities which severely restrict their\nphysical liberty whereas nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways,\nwho run away but remain within the State of Connecticut, are not\nconfined in such facilities;\nb. nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways are confined\nin secure detention facilities without even the judicial findings\n\n- 14 -\nwhich are mandated by C.G.S. §46-l49(e) as a prerequisite to the\nvesting of temporary custody of nondelinquent juveniles in suitable\npersons or agencies;\nc. nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways are confined\nin secure detention facilities without a judicial determination that\nthere is no less restrictive alternative appropriate to the needs of\nthe juvenile and the community whereas, under C.G.S. §46b-148,\ndelinquent juveniles who have violated valid court orders directing\nthem not to run away cannot be held in secure detention facilities\nunless such a judicial determination is made;\nd. nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways can be\nconfined indefinitely in secure detention facilities without any\njudicial determination as to the validity of and need for such\nconfinement whereas, under C.G.S. §46b-148, delinquent juveniles who\nhave violated valid court orders directing them not to run away\ncannot be held in such facilities for more than seventy-two hours\n(excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) without a judicial\nhearing, with continued detention allowed thereafter only upon\njudicial determination that there is no less restrictive alternative\nappropriate to the needs of the juvenile and the community;\ne. Nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways are deprived\nof the rehabilitative services and treatment provided by defendant\nWheaton to nondelinquent juvenile intrastate runaways.\n\n- 15 -\nVII. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION - Due Process\n57. The allegations of paragraphs one through fifty-six are\nincorporated by reference, as though pleaded herein in full.\n58. C.G.S. S46b-149(e), C.G.S. S46b-149a, and C.G.S. §§17-75\nthrough 17-81 as written and as applied by defendants to authorize\nthe detention of plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class of\nnondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways in secure detention\nfacilities violates plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to due\nprocess of law in that:\na. plaintiffs' physical liberty is restricted and\nplaintiffs are confined in secure and penal conditions without any\njUdicial determination of legal wrongdoing by them;\nb. plaintiffs' physical liberty is restricted without any\njudicial determination that such confinement is necessary for\ndefendants to provide rehabilitative care and treatment to them;\nc. plaintiffs' physical liberty is restricted and\nplaintiffs are confined in secure and penal conditions without any\njudicial determination that such confinement is necessary to provide\nrehabilitation to plaintiffs, to protect plaintiffs, or to protect\nsociety;\nd. plaintiffs' physical liberty is restricted without any\njudicial determination that placement of plaintiffs in said\nfacilities is the alternative which is the least restrictive of\nplaintiffs' rights to liberty and to family integrity;\n\n- 16 -\ne. plaintiffs are confined by defendants in secure and\npenal conditions which are restrictive of their liberty yet in which\nno rehabilitative care and treatment is provided to them by\ndefendants to assist them in whatever problems occasioned their run \naway behavior;\nf. defendants' commingling of plaintiffs, who are\nnondelinquent juveniles, together with juveniles who are accused\nand/or convicted of criminal conduct subjects plaintiffs to\npenalties which are constitutionally unwarranted and\ndisproportionate to their actions.\nVIII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION - Family Integrity\n59. The allegations of paragraphs one through fifty-eight are\nincorporated by reference, as though pleaded herein in full.\n60. Defendants' confinement, pursuant to C.G.S. §46b-149(e),\nC.G.S. §46b-149a, and C.G.S. §§17-75 through 17-81, of those members\nof the plaintiff class, who are nondelinquent juveniles who have run\naway from one parent but who are incarcerated in secure detention\nfacilities because they are interstate runaways subject to the\nInterstate Compact on Juveniles, C.G.S. §§17-75 et ~., violates\nsaid plaintiffs' rights to family integrity as guaranteed by the\nFirst, Nint~ and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\n- 17 -\nIX. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION - Unreasonable Seizure\n61. The allegations of paragraphs one through sixty are\nincorporated by reference, as though pleaded herein in full.\n62. Defendants' confinement of plaintiffs in secure detention\nfacilities, pursuant to C.G.S. §46b-149(e), C.G.S. §46b-149a, and\nC.G.S. §§17-75 through 17-81, violates plaintiffs' rights to be free\nof unreasonable seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nX. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION - Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention Act\n63. The allegations of paragraphs one through sixty-two are\nincorporated by reference, as though pleaded herein in full.\n64. C.G.S. §46b-149(e), C.G.S. §46b-149a, and C.G.S. §§17-75\nthrough 17-81 as written and as applied by defendants to authorize\nthe detention of plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class, who\nare nondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways, in secure detention\nfacilities are violative of the JJDPA of 1974, as amended by the\nJuvenile Justice Amendments of 1980, §5601 et ~., and most\nspecifically JJDPA's prohibition on the detention of all status\noffenders in secure detention or correctional facilities, 42 U.S.C.\n§5633(a) (12) (A.).\n\n- 18 -\nXI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWherefore, plaintiffs request that this Court:\n1. Assume jurisdiction over this action.\n2. Certify this case as a class action.\n3. Enter a declaratory judgment declaring that C.G.S.\n§46b-149(e), C.G.S. 46b-149a and C.G.S. §17-76 which allow\nnondelinquent runaways from states other than Connecticut to be\ndetained together with violent and non-violent juvenile delinquents\nin locked juvenile detention facilities are violative, both on their\nface and also as applied, of the First, Fourth, Ninth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, the JJDPA, 42 U.S.C.\n§5633(a)(12)(A), and 42 U.S.C. §1983.\n4. Enter temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions\nenjoining defendants, their agents and successors in office from\nenforcing C.G.S. §46b-149(e), C.G.S. §46b-149a and C.G.S. §17-76\ninsofar as said statutes authorize defendants to incarcerate\nnondelinquent juvenile interstate runaways in secure juvenile\ndetention facilities in Connecticut and enjoining defendants from\ncontinuing to incarcerate members of the plaintiff class in such\nfacilities,\n5. 'Award to plaintiffs their costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n- 19 -\n6. Award to plaintiffs such other and further relief as this\nCourt deems just and proper.\nRespectfully SUbmitted,\nn6\n~1dV \\+z,1AQ. / 5~_( ,Ge-k./l.£M-j\nBY:\nMartha Stone/Shelley Geballe\nConnecticut Civil Liberties\nUnion Foundation\n32 Grand Street\nHartford, CT 06106\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs",

The defendants\n:5 :;;\n.U? this action are Anthony Milano, Secretary, Office of Policy and\nManagement, John Herrington, Supervisor, Hartford Juvenile Detention\nII\nCenter, John Borys, Deputy Director, Juvenile Matters for the State\n\n- 2 -\nof Connecticut Judicial Department, and Amy Wheaton, Commissioner of\nthe Department of Children and Youth Services (collectively referred\nto herein as the \"state defendants\") and Richard Adamick, an officer\nwith the Newington Police Department (referred to herein as\n\"defendant Adamick\"). All defendants were sued in their official\ncapacities only.\n2. This action challenged defendants' policy and practice,\npursuant to C.G.S. §§46b-149(e), 46b-149a, and 17-75 et seg., of\ndetaining out-of-state nondelinquent runaway children in secure\njuvenile facilities in Connecticut. Plaintiffs asserted that\ndefendants' actions violated plaintiffs' federal constitutional\nrights under the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution and plaintiffs' rights under the\nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C.\n§5633(a)(12)(A).\n3. On February 2, 1988, this Court approved a Consent Judgment\nbetween plaintiffs and the state defendants which provided, inte~\nalia, that the state defendants would submit to the Connecticut\nGeneral Assembly in its 1988 Session a bill to amend the challenged\nstate statutes so as to prohibit the continued detention of\nout-of-state nondelinquent runaway children in Connecticut's secure\njuvenile facilities. The Judgment further provided that should this\nbill fail to pass, the Judgment could be reopened and the litigation\nresume.\n\n- 3 -\n4. The Connecticut General Assembly recently passed, and the\nGovernor signed, s.H.B. 5249 - \"An Act Concerning Runaway Juveniles\nfrom Other States\" - which amended the challenged statutes in the\nmanner as agreed to by the plaintiffs and the state defendants.\nThis Act has been designated P.A. 88-214.\n5. Because the challenged practice is now expressly prohibited\nby state law, the plaintiffs and defendant Adamick stipulate to\ndismissal of the action as to defendant Adamick, the sole defendant\nnot bound by the Consent Judgment of February 2, 1988.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nSh~b~a~o:::..l..!:<:le:\"---=-.=..l.----­\nBY:\nMartha Stone\nConnecticut Civil Liberties\nUnion Foundation\n32 Grand Street\nHartford, CT 06106\nAttorney~ for Plaintiffs\n,L7~-\"\"7\ni'':.tc'<''~<.c\n\"'.....__/\nBY:---,..c..,k.~----------+----\nFr nk Borowy\nNassau, Borowy & Grifflth\n66 Cedar Street\nNewington, CT 06111\nAttorney for Defendant Adamick\nII\n\n- 4 -\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nThis is to certify that a copy of the foregoing has been mailed\npostage prepaid to Judith Merrill Earl, Attorney for the State\nDefendants, MacKenzie Hall, 110 Sherman Street, Hartford, CT 06105\n<\n~I~ ~-JJ,.'\nthis day of 1988.\nShelley Geballe\nII",
