    "summary": "<p>In 1977 (and thereafter amended a number of times), the foster children of Jackson Missouri, represented by Children's Rights Inc., and Legal Aid of Western Missouri, filed a class action aimed at reforming the state's child welfare system. The federal complaint charges the Missouri Division of Family Services (DFS) with endangering the lives of children in state custody by failing to properly investigate and monitor foster homes that were found to be unsafe, unsanitary and unsupervised. Plaintiffs alleged that children were exposed to contagious diseases, deprived of medical and psychiatric care, subjected to physical and emotional abuse, and transferred between foster homes inappropriately and without adequate preparation. The action was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. §601 et. seq, and 42 U.S.C  §1302. </p><p>We don't have the early parts of the docket sheet in this case, so do not know the ins and outs of the subsequent litigation.  But in 1983, a settlement agreement was reached mandating top-to-bottom reform of the foster care system. In 1985, DFS sought a modification of the consent decree, which was countered by a contempt motion from the plaintiffs for state failure to implement court-ordered reforms. In 1992, a full trial was held in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Judge Dean Whipple) resulting in a finding of contempt due to a \"lack of commitment to make a good faith effort.\" The court order called for defendants to increase budgets through state lobbying and directed defendants to transfer caseworkers to Jackson County to ease caseloads. G.L. v. Stangler, 873 F. Supp. 252 (W.D. Mo. 1994)</p><p>In response, a new settlement agreement was reached in 1994, following the assessments of an expert panel. The settlement mandated such improvements as training for foster parents and mandatory criminal history and child abuse checks for prospective foster families. In 1995, a monitoring plan was developed in addition to semi-annual compliance reports thereafter.</p><p>Based on defendants' substantial compliance with components of the consent decree, in 2000, the parties renegotiated the decree, allowing the state to exit from some provisions.  On January 30, 2001, the court approved an Amended Decree and Operational Guide.  The amended decree created a permanent community quality assurance committee, which was to take over system monitoring once DFS reached substantial compliance and exited from the decree.</p><p>Over the next ten years, with court oversight, DFS successfully implemented all of the reforms required by prior court order. On February 1, 2006, the court conditionally dismissed the case, court oversight officially ended, and the state agreed to keep in place until 2009 the policies, practices and staff positions created as a result of the lawsuit.</p>",

The \nRevised Operational Guide is intended to act as an implementation plan for the Consent Decree. \nThe definitional section and the purpose statement of the Consent Decree also apply to the \nRevised Operational Guide.  Any ambiguities in the mandates of the Consent Decree are to be \ninterpreted by reference to the Revised Operational Guide. \nThe parties intend to ask the Court to incorporate this modified Consent Decree and the \nattached Revised Operational Guide into a court order which replaces the March 21, 1983, \nConsent Decree, 564 F. Supp. 1030 (W.D. Mo. 1983), and any modifications thereto, and \nsupersedes the Court's Order, dated December 7, 1992, except to the extent the December 7, \n1992 Order substitutes and add parties as defendants.  After the Court incorporates the Modified \nConsent Decree and the Revised Operational Guide, the mandates of the Consent Decree may \nonly be changed with court approval.  The parties agree, however, the mandates of the Revised \nOperational Guide may be changed by mutual consent of the parties without Court authorization \nor approval.  The parties also agree that in exceptional circumstances, class members may be \nexempted from specific requirements of the Consent Decree or Revised Operational Guide on a \ncase-by-case basis by mutual consent of the parties. \nThe parties intend to submit the Framework for the Monitoring Methodology to the G.L. \nv. Stangler Foster Care Consent Decree Committee, representatives of the plaintiffs and \ndefendants, and technical experts and is to be used by them to develop a comprehensive \nmonitoring methodology.  Once it is completed, the parties will ask the Court to incorporate the \nmonitoring methodology into a court order.  After the Court has signed such an order, the \nmonitoring methodology only may be changed with approval from the Court. \nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this Consent Decree is to provide all class members with the child welfare \nservices required by the constitution and the laws of the United States, including, but not limited \nto, protection from harm while in custody of Missouri's Division of Family Services. \nDEFINITIONS \nAdoption Worker:  A social worker as defined herein to whom adoption \nfunctions have been assigned.

Monitoring Committee.  Should \ndefendants' level of compliance with any given standard be no more than five (5) percent below \nthat set forth in the Exit Plan for anyone (1) of the six (6)-month periods defendants shall not be \nprecluded from exiting the Amended Modified Consent Decree. \na.  Defendant's are not precluded from exit based on the failure to implement \nand sustain implementation of the Community Quality Assurance Committee (Amended \nModified Consent Decree § VII) for one (1) one and one-half(1 ~) year period as \ndescribed in, 1 above.  Rather, the defendant's are required to have the Community \nQuality Assurance Committee implemented at the time transfer from all other remaining \nexit requirements has occurred and expiration is imminent.  Lack of adherence to the time \nframes outlined in ~ 3 - 4 of Amended Modified Consent Decree § VII.C does not \nconstitute a lack of complete implementation and subsequently, will not preclude exit. \n2.

While defendants shall make good faith efforts to \nmaintain the designated compliance levels, a drop in compliance levels after the transfer of a \nsection shall not be, by itself, grounds for a motion to enforce the Amended Modified Consent \nDecree or Amended Revised Operational Guide, to hold defendants in contempt or to bar future \nexpiration of the Amended Modified Consent Decree as set forth in the Exit Plan. \n32 \n\nAmended Modified Consent Decree; January 30, 200] \nNotwithstanding the above, plaintiffs may seek to enforce transferred sections or standards if a \ndrop in compliance levels results in a violation of the plaintiff children's constitutional or federal \nstatutory rights.  Nor are plaintiffs precluded from seeking to enforce transferred sections or \nstandards as remedial measures in connection with motions to enforce sections or provisions that \nhave not been transferred. \nc.  The Amended Modified Consent Decree, Amended Revised Operational \nGuide and Amended Monitoring Methodology shall expire, without further order of the court and \nwill be of no further force and effect, sixty (60) days after the transfer of the last section(s) to \nDFS' internal Quality Assurance Unit. \nd.

Plaintiffs reserve the right to move, after receiving the reports with such \nnotification, to bar the transfer of monitoring to the Quality Assurance Unit or to bar expiration of \nthe Amended Modified Consent Decree, Amended Revised Operational Guide and Amended \nMonitoring Methodology on the grounds that defendants are continuing to violate the \nconstitutional or federal statutory rights of plaintiff children or that defendants have not complied \nwith the prerequisites for transfer or expiration. \ne.  The Exit Plan has not included target dates for meeting the compliance \nstandard.  To the extent that any provisions of the Amended Modified Consent Decree, Amended \nRevised Operational Guide or Panel Recommendation referenced in the Exit Plan refers to target \ndates, such dates are not intended to be part of the Exit Plan. \n3.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this lawsuit until the Amended Modified \nConsent Decree, Amended Revised Operational Guide and Amended Monitoring Methodology \nexpire in their entirety pursuant to the terms of the Exit Plan. \nVII.  COMMUNITY QUALITY ASSURANCE COMMITTEE \nA.  Purpose and Responsibilities \nThe Community Quality Assurance Committee (CQA) is to provide permanent external advisory \nand advocacy feedback on the day-to-day judgements made within the Division of Family Services \n(DFS) concerning its functioning.

Further, the CQA's purpose is to ensure, through independent community advocacy, \nthat program, policy and practice improvements gained through the G. L. v. Stangler Amended \nModified Consent Decree are continued and expanded once Court jurisdiction is terminated.  The \nmonitoring function shall include both the information-gathering and the reporting functions of \n33 \n\nAmended Modified Consent Decree; January 30,2001 \nDFS' quality assurance programs. \nChild-specific information shall be gathered during the PDR process and presented, in written \nfonn, along with an initial written report of aggregate findings andlor observations compiled from \nthe review, to the members of the CQA for its review.

The role of these individuals in the review of \nindividual cases shall consist of a review of written case materials and active participation in the \ninterview and ratings processes.  The CQA is to assist DFS in the recruitment ofthese individuals. \nHowever, this does not preclude DFS from utilizing non-Jackson County DFS staff as reviewers \nandlor shadows in the PDR process when community participants are unavailable.  The cadre \nshall meet with the CQA regularly, as defined by the CQA membership. \nB.  MEMBERSHIP OF COMMUNITY QUALITY ASSURANCE COMMITTEE \nThe membership of the CQA shall include 7-8 professionals from child welfare or related \ndisciplines within Jackson County.  The selected membership should encompass a broad spectrum \nof professions so as to create a multi-disciplinary perspective in carrying out the functions of the \nCommittee.  DFS shall attempt to involve medical, educational and service professionals.  Terms \nof membership shall be for 3-5 years with terms staggered so that continuity of membership will \nbe maximized. \nMembers of the CQA are required to attend training related to the PDR process and participate in \none PDR review each year.  This participation includes attendance at the group case \"roll-up\" \nsession and the community presentation on the final day of the review.  Members shall be \nprepared to spend two days in training at their initial appointment.  Subsequent to their \nappointment, members must also commit to 8-10 days of activity per year during the period of \ntheir term.
