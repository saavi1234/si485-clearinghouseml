    "summary": "<p>On August 4, 1999, a group of children in the legal and/or physical custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) filed this lawsuit against the State of New Jersey and DYFS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Represented in part by Children's Rights, Inc., the plaintiffs alleged that DYFS failed to protect them from abuse, failed to provide them with services such as medical care, and failed to provide DYFS caseworkers with adequate resources and training. The plaintiffs claimed these actions violated federal common law and federal statutes. They named, in particular, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 620-27, 670-679; Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996; Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396 et seq; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12131; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that New Jersey and DYFS&rsquo;s actions violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights to association, privacy and family integrity under the First and Ninth Amendments. With the complaint, the plaintiffs also moved for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On October 12, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. On January 27, 2000, U.S. District Judge Garrett E. Brown granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; substantive due process cause of action. The court dismissed the substantive due process claim to the extent it was alleged on behalf of children who were voluntarily in state custody. The court held there was no substantive due process right to &ldquo;not remain in state custody unnecessarily&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be housed in the least restrictive, most appropriate and family-like placement while in state custody.&rdquo; The court also dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; cause of action under the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 because the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were denied the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent on the basis of race, color, or national origin.. The court denied the motion for all the other asserted causes of action, and noted that \"[t]here [was] no term other than tragic to summarize the facts\" alleged in this case. Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476 (D.N.J. 2000).</p>\r\n<p>After some procedural wrangling, in October 2000, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint as well as a modified motion to certify class action. By March 2001, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from conducting an audit of DYFS case records. The court then ordered the defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be entered. On June 28, 2001, the court again denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify class action, concluding that the plaintiffs&rsquo; class definition was overly broad. On July 30, 2001, the plaintiffs again filed a third motion for class certification, which the court granted on March 7, 2002. During this time, on September 28, 2001, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction after determining that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm and that injunctive relief was warranted. The parties proceeded towards trial and commenced discovery.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on January 27, 2003, the New York Times and other newspapers moved to intervene in the case in order to modify the confidentiality orders. The court granted the motions in part for purposes of reporting to the public about the state of the child welfare system. Charlie H. v. Whitman, 213 F.R.D. 240 (D.N.J. 2003). The New York Times published a series of articles focused on the New Jersey child welfare system, including several pieces about the death of Faheem Williams, a seven-year-old boy whose case had been closed by DYFS even though there were outstanding issues of abuse.</p>\r\n<p>Once discovery concluded, on February 27, 2003, the court entered an order referring the parties to mediation and appointed former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Stewart G. Pollack. Through mediation, the parties reached a settlement agreement in July 2003. After a fairness hearing, the court approved the settlement agreement on September 2, 2003. Under the core principles that the foster care placements be as temporary an arrangement as possible, with its goal being to provide to children in out-of-home environment safe permanent placements, the settlement agreement mandated the creation of an expert panel (the New Jersey Child Welfare Panel) which was tasked to begin the planning process for improvements in the child welfare system and overall supervision and technical assistance during the 18 month period. The agreement also set out planning procedures, definition of improved outcomes for children, and review process. Areas of immediate mandates included securing funds ($14.3 million) to hire additional man power, conducting safety assessments, reviewing high-risk facilities individually, reviewing standards for licensing, reviewing hiring processes, among others. The agreement also mandated the appointment of a monitor.</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2004, the plaintiffs moved to appoint a guardian ad litem on behalf of three class members, currently in DYFS custody, to protect their interests in any claims for damages they may have against DYFS. On April 5, 2004, after oral argument on this motion, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to appoint a guardian ad litem. The plaintiffs then moved for $150,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses on September 27, 2004. The court granted that motion on November 5, 2004.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2005, the court-appointed monitor found that the state was making \"seriously inadequate progress\" in implementing the terms of the settlement agreement. During this time, the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (CWA) were granted leave to appear as amicus curiae.</p>\r\n<p>After unsuccessful negotiations between the parties to improve progress levels, in December 2005, the plaintiffs moved to hold the defendants in contempt for noncompliance with the consent decree. However, the newly elected governor created a new cabinet-level children's agency and began new negotiations with the plaintiffs. As a result, the parties modified the settlement agreement in July 2006.</p>\r\n<p>The modified settlement agreement provided for phased implementation. In Phase 1, lasting from July 2006 to December 2008, the state committed to working in collaboration with the Monitor to develop a case practice model that addresses issues of regular case planning, development of individualized service plans, and training for caseworkers. Among the increased services for youth are mental health services, services for LGBTQ+, and regular medical examinations.</p>\r\n<p>Phase II, from January 2009 until termination of the agreement, required completion of certain outcomes based on numerous indicators&mdash;e.g., that all children are safe from abuse and that siblings are placed together. The settlement provided for bi-annual reports by a monitor and established a dispute resolution process. Until November 2015, the monitor filed reports in accordance with the modified agreement.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2015, the second modified settlement agreement was entered. The 2015 agreement identified as areas to be achieved: timely and quality completion of investigations on alleged child abuse and neglect, timely execution of initial and subsequent family team meetings, proper needs assessment, timely and quality planning of cases, proper management of intake/adoption workers' caseloads, proper parent-child/siblings visitations, stable placements (with siblings, where possible), prevention of repeat maltreatment and re-entry to placement, timely discharge to permanent placement, provision of services to support transition and independent living assessment of older youth. The agreement stipulated that the district court would maintain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the second modified settlement until such time as the parties agreed to terminate the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>For the next seven years, the state continued to work to come into compliance with the second modified settlement agreement, and the monitor filed bi-annual status reports regarding the state&rsquo;s progress. These status reports indicate that for the most part, the state continued to make progress, with only a small setback in 2020 because of the pandemic. Finally, on June 20, 2022, parties reached agreement that defendants had come into compliance with the settlement agreement, and submitted an exit plan to the court. The judge signed and entered the exit plan a day later. Under this plan, the parties agreed that it would submit all required data to the monitor by June 30, 2022, and the monitor would issue his final status report by September 30, 2022. Assuming no issues of non-compliance, the court would then set a fairness hearing, at which the case would be dismissed, but the court would retain jurisdiction through June 30, 2023, to adjudicate any breach of the exit agreement. Assuming no breaches, court oversight and jurisdiction over this case would then terminate.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next year, defendants remained compliant with the settlement agreement. Therefore, pursuant to the exit plan, the parties submitted a motion for settlement on March 23, 2023, which the court granted the next day. Following a final hearing, the court dismissed the case on April 25, 2023, terminating its oversight and jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>A year later, between February and April 2024, defendants filed requests for reinstatement of the class action, seeking to compel the court to re-open the case and effectively rescind its approval of the agreed-upon settlement. On April 30, 2024, the court provided its judgment on the defendant&rsquo;s request: The court held that the only basis on which it may consider reopening the case must be, from the terms of the settlement agreement, contained within the exit plan and agreement itself. Finding that defendants&rsquo; plea was not adequately based on those terms, the court declined to consider defendant&rsquo;s request to reopen the case.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants provided notice to the class members, informing them of the terms of the exit agreement. In that letter, defendants noted that members of the class were entitled to object to the terms of the exit agreement by providing written notice of their disagreement to the judge in the matter. One member, representing a minor in the putative class, filed an objection with the court, noting that she sought the extension of federal oversight and for the reinvestigation of foster adoption cases for compliance. The individual re-filed her objections to the exit agreement in November 2024. No further developments have occurred, and the case remains closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Plaintiffs, who are children in the custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), brought suit against the state alleging abuse, neglect, and lack of services. After the New York Times published several articles about the deaths of children in the care of DYFS due to lack of care, in 2003 the state entered into a settlement agreement providing for a systematic overhaul of the state child welfare system.  The court maintained jurisdiction over enforcement of the settlement agreement for the next two decades, while defendants gradually came into compliance with the agreement. In June of 2022, the parties agreed that defendants had come into compliance, and the court ultimately terminated its enforcement jurisdiction on April 25, 2023. This case is now closed.",

These submissions appear to be an effort on your part to contest this Court’s approval of \nthe settlement of Charlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Murphy et al., Civil Action No. 99-3678.  By \nOrder dated March 24, 2023, this Court authorized approval of an exit plan for New Jersey’s \nDivision of Child Protection and Permanency, to terminate the consent decree covering that \nagency.  On April 25, 2023, this Court issued an Order approving the settlement and approving \ndismissal of the case, subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement.  In the \nCourt’s view, the only basis on which this Court can entertain any challenge to the settlement \nagreement and dismissal are contained within the exit plan and settlement agreement themselves.  \nYour submissions do not appear to be based upon, or comply with, any of the terms and \nconditions of the exit plan and settlement agreement, and therefore your application will not be \nentertained and your request to reopen the case is hereby denied.     \n \nSO ORDERED. \n \nVery truly yours, \n \n    s/ Stanley R.

Introduction and Purpose of the Assessment \n \nOne of the most important child protective services functions of a public child welfare agency is \nto receive and to promptly and appropriately respond to  reports of suspected child abuse or \nneglect. Commonly referred to as a State’s child abuse and neglect hotline, the unit responsible \nfor receiving and responding to reports of child abuse and neglect is often the most visible face \nof public child protection. With every call, decisions are made which could potentially affect the \nsafety, well-being and chance for a stable, permanent future of a child and his or her family. The \nmanner, speed and clarity with which a public child welfare system receives, screens and acts on \ncalls to its hotline greatly influences how the community interacts with and perceives a State’s \noverall child protection performance. \n \nAs part of statewide reforms designed to more effectively protect children from abuse or neglect, \nNew Jersey created the State Central Registry (SCR) in July 2004. The SCR , now part of the \nDepartment of children and Families (DCF) replaced a system of locally operated child abuse \nhotlines  in  the  counties  and  was  intended  to  provide  statewide  consistency  in  receiving, \nclassifying, and dispatching reports of suspected child abuse or neglect and assessments for child \nwelfare services.  \n \nSince its inception, the SCR has received a growing number of calls necessitating increased staff \nand support. The SCR start-up and early implementation were not without problems as the State \ndeveloped the staff capacity, the policy, and the training and technology supports for the SCR. \nThe SCR Administrator changed five times in nearly four years, with the current leader in place \nnow for the past one and a half years.  \n \nAs with any such operation that controls the “front door” to the receipt of child welfare services, \nthe public has little tolerance for error. There have been periodic reports that too few calls are \naccepted for follow-up, thus leaving some children at risk. Conversely, the DYFS case managers \nresponsible for investigating allegations or assessing families needs often express concern that \nSCR decisions send too many reports and referrals to the field, with limited distinction between \nthose children that are at true risk of maltreatment from those situations that do not rise to a level \nrequiring an investigation or referral. In addition, over the past year and a half, DYFS case \nmanagers frequently have reported to the Monitor that the documentation they receive from the \nSCR is inadequate or inaccurate and sometimes both. This in turn, they believe, impedes their \ntimely initiation of investigations.  \n \nThis report is the result of an independent assessment of the SCR conducted by the federal court-\nappointed Monitor of New Jersey’s child welfare reforms under the Charlie and Nadine v. \nCorzine Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA). In order to determine the functioning and \nquality of the SCR’s practice, the Monitor undertook a special study of its operation using a \nvariety of methods as described in Appendix A. The Monitor was joined in the assessment by \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 1 \n\n \nrepresentatives of the New Jersey Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) and the Department of \nChildren and Families (DCF) Quality Analysis and Information unit. \n \nThis in-depth assessment of the SCR was conducted as part of the Monitor’s responsibility to \nassess how the State is making progress in its overall operations and delivery of services to the \nchildren and families of New Jersey. The goal is to provide an objective assessment and to make \nrecommendations to DCF for ongoing improvement of the functioning of the SCR.  Specifically, \nthe assessment was designed to answer the following three questions: \n \n1.  Are SCR screening decisions appropriate? \n \n2.  Is SCR screening documentation accurate and sufficiently complete to enable the \nDYFS field office case managers to respond appropriately?  \n \n3.  Is complete and accurate information reaching the DYFS field office case managers \nin a timely manner? \n \nThis assessment is the second formal assessment completed on the New Jersey’s SCR.  In 2005, \nshortly after the SCR was created, the independent Child Welfare Panel created by the original \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. McGreevey Settlement Agreement reviewed SCR operations.1 In \ncontrast  to  the  2005  review,  which  found  multiple  policy,  management    and  operational \nproblems with the SCR, this review found the SCR operations to be well managed, professional \nand appropriately focused on the timeliness and the quality of the response to the public’s \nreports of child maltreatment.  Much has been accomplished in the past three years. Overall, the \nassessment found that: \n \n•  SCR  decision-making  is  sound  and  the  vast  majority  of  screening  decisions  are \nappropriate. The Study Team concurred with the SCR call classification in 92 percent of \nthe calls reviewed and with the assigned response priority for 93 percent of the calls.  \nAfter listening to tape recordings of calls and reviewing written documentation, the \nnumber of cases in which the Study Team came to a different conclusion than the SCR \nwas  small.    The  findings  however  suggest  several  areas  in  which  additional  policy \nguidance and clarification is needed, particularly with respect to handling calls alleging \nmaltreatment  in  institutions  which  require  a  referral  to  the  Institutional  Abuse \nInvestigations Unit (IAIU) and for those reports that need a child welfare assessment, not \nan investigation, but in a urgent time frame.   \n \n•  For  the  vast  majority  of  calls,  screeners  collect  the  information  that  DYFS  case \nmanagers need in order to appropriately investigate complaints and assess families in \nneed of services, although in some cases the documentation forwarded to the field \noffices needs to be more accurate and complete. Over 80 percent of the NJ SPIRIT \nScreening  Summaries  contained  sufficient  information  to  support  the  screening  and \npriority decisions.  \n \n                                                 \n1 New Jersey Child Welfare Panel, Period I Monitoring Report, March 2005 and  Period II Monitoring Report, \nOctober 2005. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 2 \n\n \n•  The SCR completes its work in a timely fashion and the vast majority of reports or \nreferrals reach the field within three hours of a call to the SCR. Eighty (80) percent of \nthe Child Protective Services (CPS) reports and Child Welfare Services (CWS) referrals \nwere sent to the field offices within 3 hours of the conclusion of the call.  \n \n•  The majority of calls were handled thoroughly and professionally by SCR screeners. \nThe SCR has established protocols for training and supervising its workers and has \ndeveloped processes for continuous quality assurance.  These are far more developed and \neffective  than  were  evident  in  2005,  although  there  is  still  room  for  continued \nimprovement.  \n \n•  In addition to using the SCR to receive and process reports of maltreatment and \nrequests for child welfare services, the SCR call and data tracking system is currently \nused to keep track of after hours employees (SPRU workers) and their schedules.  This \nuse of SCR staff time and resources for administrative purposes that are not integral to \nthe functions of the SCR should be reconsidered.  \n \nIn addition to the findings, the report includes recommendations for change.  \n \nThe report is organized into five sections as follows: \n \nSection II. Methodology provides an overview of the Study Team, the types of information \ncollected and how the information was analyzed as part of the assessment. A more detailed \ndescription of the Methodology is in Appendix A. \n \nSection III. Current Hotline Functioning describes the SCR operations as context for the \nassessment. \n \nSection  IV.  Findings  provides  key  findings  related  to  decision-making,  documentation, \ntimeliness and Screener professionalism \n \nSection  V.  Factors  Affecting  Performance  provides  additional  discussion  of  supervision, \ntraining and other issues affecting SCR performance. \n \nSection IV. Recommendations enumerate the Study Team’s recommendations for how the SCR \ncan build on its strengths to make the needed improvements. \n \nAppendix A provides more detail on the methodology. \n \nAppendix B contains copies of the data collection instrument and focus group questions. \n  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 3 \n\n \n \nII.  Methodology \n \nThe SCR assessment was conducted in January 2008. The Study Team consisted of staff of the \nCharlie and Nadine H. federal court-appointed Monitor (The Center for the Study of Social \nPolicy), three representatives from New Jersey’s Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), and a \nrepresentative of the DYFS Quality Analysis and Information Unit. A total of nine professionals \nwere involved in the intensive review.  \n \nThe assessment had multiple components. The primary component involved using a structured \ndata collection instrument to listen to approximately 300 phone calls to the SCR from October \nand November 2007. The sample of 300 was randomly selected from the 34,114 NJ SPIRIT \nScreening  Summaries  generated  during  those  months.  The  SCR  maintains  a  call  recording \nsystem of all calls which permitted this kind of review. The sample size was designed to produce \nno more than a 6 percent margin of error with 95 percent confidence in its results. The Study \nTeam ultimately listened to 294 calls because six of the randomly selected NJ SPIRIT Screening \nSummaries were generated from correspondence rather than phone calls. The calls associated \nwith an additional 28 NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries were excluded from all of the analysis \nbecause call quality was poor, it was an internal administrative call, or it was an outgoing call. \nThe reduction from 300 to 266 was not great enough to affect the statistical margin of error. \n \nFor each of the remaining 266 NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries, the Study Team listened to the \ntaped call and reviewed the documentation in NJ SPIRIT, the State’s automated case processing \nsystem. The data collection instrument allowed reviewers to compare what they heard to written \ndocumentation, to assess whether decisions were made in accordance with law and policy and to \nevaluate the competency and professionalism of the SCR Screener. Appendix B is a copy of the \ndata collection instrument. The data were analyzed using Excel and SPSS2. \n \nIn addition, the Study Team reviewed SCR policy, training materials, Screener job aides and \nother  material  designed  to  support  the  effective  operation  of  the  SCR;  interviewed  senior \nmanagement; conducted focus groups of SCR Supervisors and Screeners; and observed daily \npeer review efforts and supervisory interactions. A more detailed description of the methodology \nis in Appendix A. \n \nDecision-making  at  the  SCR  involves  an  element  of  judgment  and  these  judgments  are \nsometimes made with incomplete information. A limitation of the methodology is that individual \njudgment could vary and people could come to different conclusions for the cases with which the \nStudy Team disagreed. The quality assurance mechanisms applied to the review as outlined in \nAppendix A should resolve concerns about variance in judgment. \n \n                                                 \n2 SPSS was formerly known as the Statistical Package for Social Science \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 4 \n\n \n \nIII.  Current Hotline Functioning  \n \nNew Jersey’s State Central Registry (SCR) is a unit of the DCF Division of Central Operations. \nThe SCR is charged with receiving calls of both suspected child abuse and neglect as well as \ncalls where reporters believe the well-being of families is at risk and needs an assessment, \nsupport, and/or information and referral. To effectively execute this responsibility, the SCR has \nestablished a 24 hour per day, 7 days per week operation that requires multiple shifts of staff and \nSupervisors  and  a  sophisticated  call  management  and  recording  system.  “Call  agents”  or \n“Screeners”3 determine the nature of each caller’s concerns and initiate the appropriate response. \nQuality assurance protocols are in place to evaluate the performance of individual Screeners and \nthe decisions made in response to calls. \n \nA.  Volume and Sources of Calls to the SCR \n \nThe calls received by the SCR cover a wide range of issues. Specifically, individual calls may \nrelay information about the possibility of a child being abused or neglected and/or that a family \nis in need of services. Allegations can be received via the toll-free hotline number of 877-NJ-\nAbuse or in writing. The SCR is also contacted by the general public, family members, DYFS \nfield office staff, and others to request information and service referrals. DCF data indicate that \nthe monthly volume of calls ranged from 15,121 to 18,267 in state fiscal year 2007. Figure 1 \nillustrates the monthly pattern of calls received in that year (from July 2006 through July 2007.)  \n \n \nFigure 1:  Number of Calls to the SCR by Month  \nJuly 2006-July 2007 \n19000\n18500\n18291 18267\n18124\n18000 17947\n17500\n17135\nCalls 17000 16830\nmber of  16500 16676\nNu 16000\n15714 15782\n15500 15589 15523 15551\n15121\n15000\n14500\n14000\nJul-06 Aug-06 Sep-06 Oct-06 Nov-06 Dec-06 Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 May-07 Jun-07 Jul-07\nMonth\n \n Source: DCF Administrative Data \n                                                 \n3 Through out the remainder of this report, the term “Screener” will be used to refer to the staff who answer the \nincoming calls to SCR and make a determination about the action to be taken. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 5 \n\n \nFigure 2 illustrates the referral sources for all child protective services and child welfare services \ncalls received in calendar year 2007.

SCR Call Flow \n \nScreeners  are  responsible  for  accurately  obtaining  information  necessary  to  decide  what \naction(s),  if  any,  should  be  taken  in  response  to  the  caller’s  information  and/or  concern. \nScreeners are not required to obtain information sufficient to determine veracity or to conduct an \ninvestigation; that responsibility is assigned to investigators at the field level in the DYFS field \noffices.  \n \nAfter the Screeners listen to a call and makes a determination as to the appropriate coding to \nclassify  the  call,  they  are  required  to  complete  a  Screening  Summary  in  NJ  SPIRIT.  The \nScreening Summary is to include information sufficient for an investigator to know the type and \nextent of maltreatment to investigate, information to transmit, or services or concerns with which \na family requires assistance and/or a referral.  \n \nAs  shown  in  Figure  3,  depending  on  the  information  or  request  the  caller  presents,  SCR \nScreeners  must  determine  which  classification  best  reflects  the  following  circumstances \nconveyed in the call:  \n•  a report of abuse or neglect in a family that should be accepted for investigation \n(CPS- Family)4 and sent to the appropriate DYFS field office; or \n•  a report of abuse or neglect in an institutional setting that should be accepted for \ninvestigation  (CPS-  IAIU)  and  sent  to  the  appropriate  regional  office  of  the \nInstitutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU); or \n•  a  referral  for  child  welfare  services  that  should  be  accepted  for  assessment  for \nrequested services and sent to the DYFS field office (CWS)5; or \n•  a report about an existing DYFS case that should be referred to the case manager(s) \nalready staffing the case (RI); or \n•  a person seeking a referral to one or more service providers (I&R) or a Screener \ndetermines that a referral is the appropriate response to the concern raised by the \ncaller, or the matter is referred back to the caller for handling (i.e. police calling about \nnon  abuse,  school  calling  about  educational  neglect  but  have  yet  failed  to  take \nappropriate action themselves to address the issue); or \n•  individuals seeking information only (IO); or \n•  a person contacting DYFS who needs information about DYFS operations; or \n•  a report that requires no further action by the SCR coded as No Action Required \n(NAR).6 \n                                                 \n4 These calls are broken down even further based on against whom the allegation is made and where the alleged \nabuse or neglect may have taken place. \n5 A call considered to be a CWS referral that is to be transmitted to one of three counties –Mercer, Passaic, and \nMiddlesex—is sent to those counties as “CWS pending” as part of a pilot program to look at the efficacy of having a \ncommunity agency, rather than DYFS, conduct the assessment of family needs. In these three counties, the counties \nhave the option of making some additional collateral phone calls within 72 hours before deciding to assign it to one \nof its own Intake staff or refer the family to a community agency. These CWS referrals, therefore, are considered \n“pending” and the screening is not considered complete until the field office in these counties makes the decision \nabout referral assignment.  \n6 Four counties (Cumberland, Gloucester, Camden and Salem) were chosen to participate in a pilot called \n“Differential Response” (DR).  The pilot is intended to provide supportive prevention services and promote healthy \nfamily functioning. For those counties, persons calling for Information and Referral and information about family \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 7 \n\n \n \nGeneral criteria for accepting a report of child abuse or neglect include the following7: \n•  the alleged child(ren) victim is less than 18 years of age; \n•  the alleged perpetrator is the child’s parent or guardian, or other person in a care \ngiving role who had custody or control of the child(ren); \n•  there is a specific incident or set of circumstances that suggest the harm or substantial \nrisk of harm to the child(ren) was caused by the child’s parent, guardian or other \nperson in a care giving role who had custody or control of the child(ren); \n•  the alleged child victim(s) has been harmed or is at substantial risk of harm. \n \nReports of child abuse and/or neglect are investigated by DYFS case managers in the field \noffices to determine if further protective action is required. If DYFS believes abuse or neglect is \ndetermined to have occurred, subsequent decisions are made about the kinds of services that \nneed to be put in place to ensure a child’s safety, including the possibility of legal action to \nremove a child from his or her home. Field offices respond to child welfare service (CWS) \nreferrals with an assessment of the family’s strengths and needs and an offer of services which \nthe family may accept or refuse. \n \nIf the call is classified as a Child Protective Services (CPS) report or Child Welfare Services \n(CWS) referral, the Screener must also determine the urgency of the situation and assign a \n“response  priority.”  The  response  priority  establishes  the  time  frame  in  which  DYFS  case \nmanager in the field offices are expected to respond. In either case, DYFS field offices may \ndetermine a more urgent response is needed and act accordingly.   \n \nReports of allegations with the greatest urgency are coded as CPS Immediate.  If a report \nrequiring  an  immediate  response  time  is  taken  during  normal  business  hours,  DYFS  case \nmanagers in the field offices are required to respond by the close of the business day.  If the \nreport is created after normal business hours or on weekends, the assigned Special Response Unit \n(SPRU)  worker  in  the  receiving  DYFS  field  office  will  respond  and,  according  to  written \nmaterials  provided  to  the  Study  Team,  the  expectation  is  that  SPRU  workers  initiate  an \ninvestigation within an hour of receiving the assignment from SCR. Calls alleging abuse or \nneglect that appear to have a lesser degree of urgency are assigned as CPS 24 hours and are \nrequired to be investigated by field investigative staff within 24 hours.  \n \nCalls  that  a  Screener  determines  require  assistance  and  services  for  families,  termed \n“assessments”, are coded as “CWS” referrals. CWS referrals are assigned either a 72 hour or 5 \nday response time, depending on their urgency. However, DYFS policy states that the SCR \nScreener  “after  hours,  on  weekends,  or  during  State  holidays,  may  dictate  a  quicker  field \nresponse” and “an ‘immediate’ response (within two hours) may be appropriate, often in matters \nassigned after hours to SPRU.”8 This enables the family to access services as soon as possible \nwithout needing to wait until the next business day.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nsupports or calls that would otherwise be coded as CWS are directly referred (sometimes through a warm-line \ntransfer) to the DR pilot programs. \n7 See Section 2.I.E. of SCR Revised Operations Manual. \n8 See Section II.209.1, Field Operations Casework Policy and Procedures Manual. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 8 \n\n \nAt the time of the review, there were two pilot projects underway that modified SCR decision-\nmaking and coding for a subset of counties.  Calls referred to the participating counties in the \nDifferential Response (DR) pilot were coded as No Action Required, with another NJ SPIRIT \nfield used for indicating it was actually a Differential Response referral. For all calls involving \nfamilies in the designated counties, the Screener connects the Caller directly with designated \npersonnel in the pilot sites through a telephone transfer.  The counties then proceed to make \ndecisions about the appropriate response to the call.  In the other pilot project, SCR Screeners \ntakes the information from the call about a family or circumstance in one of the counties \nparticipating in the CWS Pending pilot, but if the Screener considers the circumstances meet the \ncriteria for a Child Welfare Services referral, the referral is sent to the appropriate county as a \nCWS Pending referral and the DYFS field office makes the determination as to whether to send \nIntake staff to the home or refer the family to a community agency.  \n \nFigure 3 below depicts the classifications of and subsequent expected response times to calls that \nare received by the Screeners. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 9 \n\n  Figure 3:  \nSCR Call Classification and Flow \n \n \n  RESPONSE \nDETERMINATION RESPONDER\n   PRIORITY\n \n \nCPS ‐  Field \n \nFAMILY  Office \n(cid:131) Immediate \n(cid:131) 24 hour \nCPS ‐  Regional \nIAIU  IAIU \n(cid:131) Immediate \n(cid:131) 24 hour \n  Field \n \nOffice \n  (cid:131) Immediate \nCWS  (cid:131) 72 hour \n(cid:131) 5 day \nField Office in: \n72 hour Pending  (cid:131)  Mercer \n(cid:11)\nStatus \n(cid:131)  Passaic \n(cid:131)  Middlesex\n1‐877‐NJ‐Abuse \nNo  Differential \n Action  Response in: \n(cid:131)  Camden \n(cid:131)  Cumberland \nFor Differential Response, 72 \n(cid:131)  Gloucester \nhours by responding agency \n(cid:131) Salem\nRelated  Field \nInformation  None Office \nInformation  Direct Response \n& Referral  by the Screener \nInformation  Direct Response \nOnly  by the Screener \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 10 \n\n \nC.  Operations  \n \nThere are various levels of staff responsible for the efficient operation of the SCR. The SCR \nAdministrator has the overall responsibility for SCR performance and reports directly to the DCF \nDirector of Central Operations. The lead Casework Supervisor oversees day-to-day screening \noperations, which includes managing staff schedules and supervising screening Supervisors. \nScreeners are organized into units consisting of four to six full time Screeners for every one full \ntime Supervisor. \n \n•  Technology \nThe  SCR  employs  a  sophisticated  telephone  system  that  supports  operations \nmanagement. The call system automatically directs calls to the first available Screener. It \nalso notifies Supervisors of the length of time a call is waiting to be answered and it \nallows the Supervisors to track the availability of Screeners to take calls. Supervisors \nhave the ability to listen in on calls. All calls, both incoming and outgoing, are recorded.  \n \n•  Multiple shifts \nMultiple shifts of Screeners are necessary to provide coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days \nper week. There are approximately nine distinct shifts each day. During the time period \nunder review (October and November 2007), there were 188 designated Screeners, 70 \npercent were full-time employees of the SCR and the remaining 30 percent were part-\ntime staff members primarily working on the evening and weekend shifts.9  At any given \ntime during regular working hours there are typically 35 - 45 Screeners on the call floor \nwho are available to answer phone calls and take reports.  \n \n•  Supervision \nThe  SCR  is  organized  into  multiple  supervisory  units.  Each  Screener  reports  to  a \ndesignated  Supervisor  (SFSS2)  for  general  supervision  on  day-to-day  activities  and \nevaluation.  Supervisors report to Casework Supervisors (SFSS1). \n \nDuring  each  shift,  at  least  one  Supervisor  (SFSS2)  is  designated  as  the  Call  Floor \nSupervisor (CFS) to provide direction to staff on the call floor; review any reports or \nreferrals as a back up to unavailable Supervisors; ensure sufficient staffing patterns; and \ngenerally monitor staff on the call floor. \n \n•  Screener training  \nIn addition to new worker training for all DYFS staff, Screeners receive classroom \ntraining by SCR trainers about SCR policies and protocols for 8 weeks prior to taking any \nSCR calls. On-the-job training involves listening in on Supervisors’ or more experienced \nstaff’s calls to become familiar with expectations. Supervisors evaluate when Screeners \nare ready to take calls on their own, and provide on-going supervision and support as \ndiscussed herein.  \n                                                 \n9 Part‐time staff are DCF employees who work in other operations during the day \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 11 \n\n \nD.  Quality Assurance \n \nAs of the review period (October and November 2007), the SCR had established measures to \nensure consistent decision-making among staff and to ensure that calls that did not appear to \nneed field follow-up (coded variously as “No Action Required (NAR),” or Information and \nReferral (I&R)) were correctly classified. These measures included the following: \n \n•  Two  Screener  “levels”  have  been  created  --  certified  and  uncertified.  Certified \nScreeners are able to transmit reports or referrals to the field without obtaining prior \nsupervisory approval. Screeners are certified through a three-step review process. \nFirst, Supervisors are continually assessing who may be considered for certification \nthrough weekly assessment of general screening abilities.  If a Supervisor determines \nthat a Screener is ready, the certification process continues with two more activities.  \nSupervisors listen to minimally ten randomly selected calls and employ a worker \nevaluation tool that is part or the NICE call recording system to “score” the calls. If a \nScreener receives an average score of 85 from the selected calls, and there are no \nserious errors or omissions, his/her Supervisor may recommend certification. As a \nfinal step, the Casework Supervisor then reviews the Supervisor’s recommendation \nand listens to the same calls selected by the Supervisor and five additional randomly \nselected calls of the recommended Screener. If the Casework Supervisor agrees with \nthe Supervisor, the Screener is certified and NJ SPIRIT is modified to allow the \nScreener  to  transmit  reports  and  referrals  to  the  field  without  obtaining  prior \nsupervisory approval.  Uncertified Screeners are required to get approval from a \nSupervisor  regarding  each  report  or  referral  before  it  is  sent  to  the  field  for \ninvestigation or a child welfare assessment. All Screeners are directed to consult a \nSupervisor any time they are uncertain about (1) whether the information obtained on \nthe call meets the criteria for an abuse or neglect report, or (2) whether DCF should \nbe offering services, and (3) response priority.  \n \n•  According to SCR quality assurance protocol, Supervisors are required to listen to at \nleast two randomly selected recorded calls per week for each certified Screener and at \nleast three randomly selected recorded calls per week for each uncertified Screener to \nevaluate  each  Screener  on  several  dimensions,  including  thoroughness  and \nsequencing of questions, telephone demeanor, and clarity of communication.  \n \n•  Protocol exists to review the NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries of calls coded as not \nrequiring SCR response or field intervention (“NAR” calls -- No Action Required) \nand calls seeking information but not intervention (“I&R” calls – Information and \nReferral) to ensure that all reports have been coded and responded to appropriately.10 \nThe protocol requires that documentation of all NAR and I&R reports received by the \nSCR are reviewed daily by a rotation of SCR Supervisors and their screening units. \nEach morning, reports of calls from the previous day that were coded as not requiring \nDYFS field office intervention are reviewed a second time by a rotating unit of \n                                                 \n10 See Section 7, SCR Operations Manual \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 12 \n\n \nScreeners and Supervisors. Sometimes the coding of calls changes as a result of this \nsecond look, but more often the process confirms the original coding.11  \n \nE.  SCR workload: call type and duration \n \nThe SCR received between 15,000 to 19,000 calls per month in the first half of 2007 and the \ncombined  total  number  of  calls  for  October  and  November  2007  (the  study  period)  was \napproximately 34,000. Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of call types for the 266 NJ SPIRIT \nScreening Summaries in the review sample. Approximately 40% of calls which the Study Team \nreviewed were reporting child abuse or neglect allegations or requesting child welfare services \nand thus were sent to DYFS field offices or to a regional office of the Institutional Abuse \nInvestigations Unit (IAIU) for a response. Thirteen percent of the calls were categorized as \nSPRU calls. These calls were from field office workers in the Special Response Unit (SPRU)12 \nwho were calling to check in for their shifts.13 The other 46 percent of calls were Information \nOnly (IO), Information and Referral (I&R), No Action Required (NAR) or Related Information \ncalls which required no action by DYFS field offices.14  \n \nFigure 4: Percent of Calls by Type \nn = 266 NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries \nADMIN/SPRU\n13%\nInformation Only\n22%\nChild Welfare Services\n9%\nCPS IAIU\nInformation and Referral\n3%\n4%\nNo Action Referral\n4%\nRelated Information\nCPS Family\n17%\n28%\n \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n                                                 \n11 During the review period, the Study Team was able to observe five morning review sessions.

It does \nallow SCR Screeners to dictate a “quicker field response” if the referral is taken after hours, weekends, and State \nholidays.  An “immediate” response is framed as “within 2 hours”. The CWS immediate response referrals indicated \nin Figure 6 were taken after hours or on weekends and all were assigned to SPRU workers either by SCR or at the \nrequest of the field.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 15 \n\n \nIV.  Findings \n \nThis assessment was designed to determine whether: \n \n1.  SCR screening decisions are appropriate; \n2.  SCR screening documentation is accurate and sufficiently complete to enable the \nfield to respond appropriately; and  \n3.  Accurate and complete information is reaching the DYFS field office staff in a timely \nmanner.  \n \nAfter listening to 266 calls17 and comparing them to the NJ SPIRIT documentation, the Study \nTeam  found  the  following  with  regard  to  decision-making,  documentation,  timeliness,  and \nprofessionalism of the SCR.  \n \nA.  Decision-Making \n \n•  The Study Team Reviewers concurred with the SCR call classification in 92 percent of the \ncalls reviewed.  \n \nThe Study Team rated their agreement with the decisions made by the Screener regarding the \nclassification of each call based on what was heard on the recorded call and what was written in \nthe NJ SPIRIT Screening Summary. To ensure consistency among the Study Team Reviewers, a \nsecond Reviewer evaluated every call in which a Study Team Reviewer disagreed with the SCR \nScreeners’ original coding or response priority decision.18  If there was disagreement among the \nteam, a third member listened to the call. \n \nThe Study Team agreed with the Screener’s determinations in 92 percent of the calls that \nrequired  a  determination  (213  of  232).19  The  Study  Team  disagreed  with  the  SCR  call \nclassification or believed there was insufficient information to assess the determination in 19 \ncalls.  \n \nTable 2 below provides a summary by call of the original coding decision and the Study Team’s \ndetermination for the 19 calls in which there was a disagreement. In the Study Team’s judgment, \ntwo calls would be downgraded from CPS to CWS and one would be downgraded from CWS to \nRelated Information. More calls would be upgraded: three from CWS to CPS; two from Related \nInformation to CPS-IAIU; and one from No Action Required to CPS-IAIU.  In addition, as \nshown in Table 2, the Study Team identified several calls where no additional or different field \naction may have been required but they disagreed with how the call was classified based on SCR \n                                                 \n17 The analysis for these findings excluded 34 calls from the 266 calls listened to that were primarily administrative \ncalls related to SPRU staff calling the SCR to report in for work shifts, indicate that they were unable to reach a \nfamily during their shift, or request some other information. This left a total of 232 calls where the Screener had to \ndecide about the nature of the call, its classification and appropriate follow-up action(s). \n18 In addition to the quality assurance check on calls which a Study Team Reviewer disagreed with the SCR \nScreeners’ original coding or response priority decision, ten percent of the completed instruments received a second \nreview by the Monitor to ensure consistency and inter-rater reliability among the reviewers. \n19 The sample of 232 still had a margin of error of +6%. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 16 \n\n \ncriteria.      Finally,  there  were  four  calls  where  the  Study  Team  could  not  assess  Screener \njudgment because of insufficient information for decision-making. \n \nTable 2: Nature of Study Team Disagreement  \nwith the SCR Screeners’ Coding Decision \nn = 19  \nStudy Team \nCase  SCR Code  Study Team Justification \nCode \nDowngrade Calls (3) \n1  CPS Family  CWS  No indication of safety concerns for child in question. Caller stated \nthat teen mother had asked a girlfriend to babysit at school. Baby \nwas released to grandfather with whom mother and infant live. \nCaller stated baby was fine but there were concerns that mother \nmight be using drugs but reporter had not witnessed drug use. No \nindication baby was in danger or at risk.  \n2  CPS Family  CWS  No indication of risk or safety concerns for child in question.  No \nnew allegation on a family with an open case. Mother had just given \nbirth to a 23-week old baby who died shortly after birth due to \nmedical complications unrelated to substance abuse or neglect of the \nmother.  However, mother did test positive for marijuana and mother \nsaid it was from “contact” with her friends who smoke.  Mother has \na child age 3 and half who was with her father while she was in the \nhospital.  Mother had a restraining order against the father of the \ndeceased child. Reporter stated that field office intake worker was \naware of the situation, however the NJ SPIRIT Screening Summary \ndid not reference any previous or current open investigations.   \n3  CWS  RI  There did not appear to be a new allegation; call was related to an \nopen investigation. County case manager asked for a CWS referral \nto enable case manager to interview other children living in the same \nhousehold with a family who had been reported two weeks earlier \nregarding sexual abuse by a family member. \nUpgrade Calls (6)  \n4  CWS- CPS  Educational neglect.  Seven year old child who had not been in \nPending  school for a month, after being sent home with head lice.  Mother \nwould not allow school personnel to see child but reported child \nbroke her hand when it was slammed in a door. Mother could not \nspecify when child would return to school and had not contacted \nschool about child’s missed school work.  At least one younger child \nis in the home. \n5  CWS  CPS  Inadequate Shelter.  At 4:30 in the afternoon, police reported youth \nin station who had been a runaway for two weeks and could not \nreturn to the shelter from which she had run.  SCR appears to have \ncoded CWS but given to local SPRU for immediate follow-up. The \nchild is homeless and in need of services.  In the absence of a policy \nfor CWS immediate code, assigning this to SPRU is a work-around \nthat provided an immediate response, but Study Team judged this \nCPS. \n6  CWS  CPS  Inadequate Supervision.  Abandonment.  Lockout. Custodial care-\ntaker told teen mother to leave her house without helping her to \nmake other living arrangements and was unaware of teen’s location \nat time of call.  Teen’s infant remained with care taker. Care taker \nwants to relinquish legal rights of teen.  Custodial care-taker leveled \nseveral allegations of neglect against teen mother.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 17 \n\n \nStudy Team \nCase  SCR Code  Study Team Justification \nCode \n7  NAR  CPS-IAIU  Environmental Neglect or “placing a child in an environment that is \ninjurious to the health and welfare of the child.” Parent and \nGrandparent calling to complain about a facility where child lived \nMonday through Friday.

Screener sent report to licensing.    \n8  RI  CPS-IAIU  No indication that this case was already open but indication of \nintimidation. Caller reported concern about day care program’s staff \nintimidation of the children by screaming at them and children are \nfearful.  Appears to be coded Related Information because the \nreporter’s sister has as an open CWS case and reporter’s nephew is \nin the day care program. \n9  RI  CPS-IAIU  Inadequate Supervision.  AWOL youth returned to group home and \nalmost immediately started a fight with another resident.  Reporter \ndid not know what started fight.  Reporter indicated that she was on \nthe phone when youth returned to facility and came to see reporter \nbut reporter did not put call on hold or end in order to immediately \naddress youth and her absence so youth went outside and the \naltercation with another youth began.   \nOther Reclassification (4)  \n10  I&R  IO  Reporter accused her daughter’s cheerleading coaches of being \nverbally abusive with offensive language and demeaning attitude \ntoward the teenagers.  Screener advised caller to address concerns \nwith coaches or program that employs them, did not refer the caller \nto any resource. \n11  IO  I&R  Caller was specifically concerned with scheduling someone to come \nspeak with staff on how to report. Screener could have referred caller \nto area office in her locale. Caller put on hold quickly while Screener \ntried to connect all. If coded I and R caller could be referred directly \nto field office for response.  \n12  IO  RI  Caller identified herself as sister of mother in open case. Caller \nindicated she's acting per her conversation with the caseworker on \nher sister's case and identifies the case worker. Caller specifically \nwanted to verify the correct number to contact when she located her \nsister and the child. Screener confirmed that caller should call SCR \nnumber when she locates sister and the child. Screener did not get \nspecifics on case asserted to be open and coding as Information Only \nperhaps created a potential gap. \n13  IO  RI  Reporter calling for second time in four hours because no one had \nyet responded to her earlier call in the evening about a foster youth.  \nThe Foster Parent had “put the youth in the ambulance with a note \nthat she wanted nothing more to do with the youth.”  Without a \nDYFS staff member being there, the reporter said they could not \ninterview, treat, or medicate the youth. This was not a call with a \nnew allegation, but a follow-up to an earlier report. \n14  IO  RI  Caller had called previously and was giving more information on an \nopen investigation. \n15  RI  IO  No indication of open case or ongoing investigation. Caller was \ncalling about school truancy issue but reported that the parents had \ndecided to home school child. \n \n \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 18 \n\n \nStudy Team \nCase  SCR Code  Study Team Justification \nCode \nInsufficient Information To Assess SCR Decision-Making (4) \n16  CPS Family    Police reported that two children, ages 10 and 5 were left alone by \nfather for reportedly 20 minutes during which time there was an \nattempted burglary.  Children were not harmed.  Father had left them \nto drive the baby sitter to her home.  Screener did not ask pertinent \nquestions to determine risk or frequency of harm to children to know \nwhether services or an investigation should be initiated. \n17  RI    Youth in a facility punched the wall with his fist several times and \nwas taken to the Emergency Room where she was found to have \ncontusions.  She then returned to the facility.  Screener did not obtain \nthe circumstances surrounding the youth’s behavior to know if the \nyouth had been inadequately supervised or to know if youth was \nreturning to a potentially risky situation.  This call does not appear to \nhave been referred to IAIU or any investigative staff to collect more \ninformation about the incident.   \n18  RI    Youth calling and asking for someone to “come and get me” at her \nmother’s home.  Screener was unable to gather more information \nbecause of poor phone connection and youth hung-up.  However, it \nwas known that there were 2 prior CPS intakes for this family.  \nStudy team believed this call should have been addressed \nimmediately because it is an open case and the child’s request \nsounded urgent.  \n19  NAR    Anonymous Caller could provide little information.  Alleged that \ninfant was not being fed and clothed properly. Provided father’s \nname and indicated that the family was getting TANF and disability \nand had been involved with DYFS with two other children.  Father \nhas a criminal record.  Believed the family lived in Newton but \nreporter said they moved “a lot.” However, the Screener indicated \nthat they were unable to search in SPIRIT or other data bases \nbecause reporter was not aware of correct names. Caller did not \nprovide any location information.  \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n \nFor the first three calls listed in Table 2, Study Team Reviewers would have downgraded the \ncoding of the call from CPS-Family or Child Welfare Services (CWS) to a (CWS) referral or \nRelated Information code. While all three of these cases require DCF attention, child welfare \nassessments  or  intervention  by  another  DYFS  case  manager  were  appropriate.  CPS \ninvestigations did not appear warranted based on the information in the calls. For example, one \ncaller was concerned about a mother leaving her baby with a girl friend at school and that the \nmother  might  be  using  drugs.  However,  at  the  time  of  the  call,  the  baby  was  with  his \ngrandparents who said they would care for the child and there was no indication offered by the \ncaller that the baby was in immediate danger or at risk. The Screener selected allegations of \n“substantial  risk  of  physical  injury  or  environment  injurious  to  health  and  welfare”  and \n“inadequate supervision” as the CPS allegations to be investigated. An assessment for child \nwelfare services appeared to be more appropriate to the Study Team given that there was no \nindication that the child was at risk.  \n \nThe second call that the Study Team believed could be downgraded from a CPS report to a \nRelated Information call was the situation of a mother of a 3 year old with an open DYFS case. \nThe mother had a child who died at birth, and while she was known to use marijuana, the death \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 19 \n\n \nof the child was not attributed to the marijuana use. There was no information provided by the \ncaller to suggest the 3 year old was at risk of harm, and, in fact, the caller reported that the family \nwatches the child when the mother is with her friends who smoke marijuana.  \n \nThe third call was a DYFS field office case manager asking for a CWS referral to be made back \nto his office to enable him to interview other children in the household of an accused sexual \nperpetrator.  This was not a new allegation, nor was it a request for services by the family.  In \naddition, DYFS was already involved. \n \nFor the next six of the 19 calls listed in Table 2, Study Team Reviewers would have upgraded \nthe  coding  of  the  call  from  CWS,  NAR  or  RI  to  CPS  or  CWS.  A  pattern  among  these \ndisagreements raises concerns about what circumstances require a response from the Institutional \nAbuse  Investigation  Unit  (IAIU).  The  Study  Team  determined  that  three  calls  should  be \nupgraded to CPS- IAIU as the reporters raised questions about the safety and well-being of youth \nin group homes, other foster care settings, or other institutional programs. The circumstances of \nthese three calls are as follows: \n \n•  Caller with concern that staff “conduct/discipline” at a public school in a YMCA-\nsponsored  after  school  K-3  program  was  making  children  fearful  was  coded  as \n“Related  Information”  because  the  reporter,  who  wished  to  remain  anonymous, \nappeared to be the aunt of a child in a family with an open Child Welfare Services \nassessment. However, this call was not an allegation regarding the family, it was an \nallegation regarding the institution/after school program. The information indicated \nthe children were being “screamed at” and “pointed at” which could have supported \nan allegation of intimidation as encompassed by “Substantial Risk of Physical Injury \nor Environment Injurious to Health.” No information appeared to have been sent to \nIAIU.  \n \n•  Call from a group home administrator reporting a fight between two youths that sent \none  youth  to  the  hospital  for  evaluation  of  injuries  was  coded  as  “Related \nInformation” because both youth were in DYFS’s custody. The Screener asked some \nrelevant  questions  which  may  have  supported  an  allegation  of  “inadequate \nsupervision” and attempted to create the scenario (by asking leading questions and \nstating assumptions about what had occurred) that prompted the attack of one youth \non the other. Caller disagreed with Screener’s assumptions and said that the attack \nappeared to be unprovoked. However, the caller said she was talking on the telephone \nat the time of the attack and did not witness it. \n \n•  In a call that was coded “No Action Required”, the caller described a program that \nwas infested with bed bugs. The caller was not satisfied that the program’s response \nwas sufficient because it did not include supplying new mattresses. The caller was \ntold to raise this concern with the program administrator. The child in question was \nnot in DFYS custody and the family did not appear to have any prior involvement \nwith DFYS. The call was discussed with the IAIU Supervisor who suggested that the \nNJ SPIRIT Screening Summary be routed to the Office of Licensing although it was \nnot referred to IAIU for investigation. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 20 \n\n \n \nAmong the remaining three calls that the Study Team determined should be upgraded, all were \nCWS referrals that were judged to be CPS reports.    Finally, there were four calls in which there \nwas insufficient information provided or gathered to enable the Study Review Team to assess the \nSCR decision-making. \n \nIn summary, these findings document that the SCR decision-making regarding the classification \nof calls based on the information received is substantially sound.  However, there remain some \nareas of possible confusion and inconsistency. In each of the staff focus groups conducted by the \nStudy Team, some staff expressed concern that SCR decision-making, especially in some of the \nmore difficult areas, was inconsistent and, to a degree, arbitrary, particularly among Supervisors. \nFor example, Screeners report that some Supervisors interpret policy as requiring an immediate \ninvestigation more often than other Supervisors.  In more than one focus group, Screeners \nreported that they felt that perhaps 20 percent of cases are arbitrarily coded. It is important to \nnote however that the prevalence of this staff perception is not fully supported by the Study \nTeam findings based on the call review. \n \n•  Identifying which calls require IAIU action appears to be particularly challenging to \nScreeners.  \n \nThe Study Team judged that calls should be coded as “CPS-IAIU” and referred to IAIU for \ninvestigation more often than the SCR Screeners. Three of the six calls that were judged to \nrequire an upgrade should have, in the Study Team’s judgment, been routed to IAIU. This \npattern actually matched what was seen in the seven calls in the sample that appeared to be \ncorrectly classified as CPS-IAIU. Four of the seven had initially been coded differently by the \nScreener and were upgraded by a Supervisor. Two of the four were initially coded by Screeners \nas No Action Required; one was coded Child Welfare Services; and it is unclear how the fourth \ncall was initially coded. All four of these calls were upgraded to CPS-IAIU as a result of \nsupervisory review several hours after the initial call and screening decision.  \n \nThe summaries below provide information on the four calls that were initially coded as CWS or \nNAR and eventually changed to an IAIU referral as a result of SCR supervisory review: \n \n•  One call initially coded Child Welfare Services involved sexual contact between 5 \ndifferent children who were placed at a congregate care facility. Three of the five \nchildren were in the custody of DYFS. During the call and through the initial coding, \nthe SCR Screener focused on the child-on-child sexual activity as opposed to the \nlocation in which this activity occurred. This focus resulted in the call initially being \ncoded as a CWS with a 72 hour response instead of a CPS-IAIU. \n \n•  Two calls were initially coded No Action Required.  One of the two calls reported \nthat a child had sex with a counselor while living at a residential facility. The other \ncall  involved  a  teacher  inappropriately  touching  a  13  year  old  child.  Both  were \nupgraded to CPS-IAIU as a result of further supervisory review. \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 21 \n\n \n•  The fourth call involved a physical altercation between an 11 year old child and a \nteacher. The documentation does not indicate how this call was originally coded, but \nafter supervisory review, a new report was generated with a CPS-IAIU coding. \n \nThese findings, coupled with staff comments in the focus groups and the Study Team’s own \njudgments of the calls cited previously, raise questions about criteria for referrals to IAIU in \nparticular.  In the focus groups, Screeners reported a lack of clarity as to the coding of a report of \nabuse or neglect in an institutional setting. A certified Screener summarized the concern by \nsaying that sometimes a report comes in that would be considered in need of immediate action \n(CPS) if the parent was the perpetrator, but is not coded as an abuse or neglect call (CPS-IAIU) \nif the call comes from a facility or is about a foster parent. In fact, some focus group participants \nsaid it was their impression that IAIU consultant staff may be contacted first before a coding \ndecision  is  made  and  sometimes  “challenges”  the  decision  to  code  a  report  “CPS-IAIU,” \nrequesting the report to be downgraded.  \n \n•  Criteria for classifying calls as Child Welfare Services referrals versus “Related \nInformation” are not clear. \n \nSince its inception, the SCR has struggled with what constitutes a CWS referral.20 The analysis \nof the 23 CWS-designated calls in the sample indicate a pattern of either 1) confusion for SCR \nand the field; or 2) concern that assigned DYFS field office case managers would be unable to \nrespond quickly enough to address the emerging urgent child/family circumstances; or 3) both. \nIn addition to the four Child Welfare Services referrals described in Table 2 that the Study Team \nthought should be coded differently, there were seven CWS referrals that appeared to relate to \nopen permanency cases and could possibly have been coded “Related Information” instead. \nAlthough the Study Team did not disagree with the decision-making during the process of \nlistening to the taped calls, this later analysis does raise questions for further follow-up.  \n \nIn five of the seven calls that could have been coded “Related Information,” the SCR assigned an \n“immediate” response time by sending it to a designated SPRU worker. In one instance, it was \nthe field office who asked that referral be “upgraded to SPRU.” The circumstances involved a \nmother with an open permanency case who had just given birth to another child. Because DYFS \nhad previously requested the mother’s prenatal care records, the hospital called to report the birth \nbut reported that the baby was healthy and they had no concerns. This call was on a Saturday. \nThe field office with the open case reported that it actually was on the verge of closing the \nfamily’s case, but wanted a SPRU worker assigned to conduct an assessment that day to ensure \nthat  the  baby  was  safe.  SCR  leadership  report  that  field  staff  sometimes  leave  “special \ninstructions” at SCR in case a call comes in on an open case after hours. The practice is that the \nfield office case manager and Supervisor conference and make a joint decision to leave such \nspecial instructions prior to calling them into SCR. \n \n                                                 \n20 New Jersey Child Welfare Panel, Period I Monitoring Report, March 2005, p 30. and  Period II Monitoring \nReport, October 2005, p36. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 22 \n\n \nOther instances of CWS “immediate” referrals included: \no  A 17-year old youth who had runaway from her placement the previous month \nwas about to be discharged from a hospital emergency room at midnight. \no  Two foster children being transported at midnight to the hospital for treatment \nof bronchitis and needed someone to “sign them in.” Foster mother was with \nthem. \no  A 16-year old youth who had run away from placement two weeks previously \nand was at a police station at 4:30 p.m. The reporting police wanted someone \nto come immediately. \no  A group home director calling at 10:30 p.m. asking for the immediate removal \nof a 17-year old placed in home. The Director believed the youth was a risk to \nhimself and others thus he did not want to wait until the next day to call \nDYFS. \n \n•  For calls not requiring a field response, multiple classification choices are confusing  \n \nThe final set of six coding disagreements listed in Table 2 focused on calls that do not require a \nfield response. Although the Study Team did not agree with the specific coding of these six calls, \nthey were in agreement that none of them required a field office response. For example, in some \ncases “Information Only” calls were judged to more appropriately be “Related Information” to \nexisting cases or investigations because they provided information relevant to open cases or \ninvestigations. The importance of these coding differences may not be that significant although it \nis  possible  that  with  incorrect  coding,  the  timely  transfer  of  important  information  to  the \nappropriate parties is compromised. \n \nThe Study Team Reviewers documented confusion over the difference between Information \nOnly (IO) calls and Information and Referral (I&R) calls. Minutes of the SCR Supervisor \nMeetings reflect a rapid change of policy on this issue. The November 7, 2007 minutes instruct \nSupervisors not to code calls made from SPRU workers (field staff working as first responders \noutside of regular working hours) calling in to schedule shifts as “Related Information” or \n“Information  and  Referral”  calls.  Instead,  Screeners  are  instructed  to  code  such  calls  as \n“Information  Only”  calls.  Less  than  two  weeks  later,  Supervisor  Meeting  Minutes  dated \nNovember 20, 2007 appear to instruct Screeners not to code calls taken from SPRU workers as \n“Information Only” calls.  \n \n•  The Study Team agreed with the assigned response priority for 93 percent of the calls. \n \nIn addition to assessing the appropriateness of the call classification, the Study Team judged \nwhether the assigned response priority appropriately reflected the urgency of the circumstances \nconveyed in the call (e.g. immediate or 24 hours for CPS calls or immediate or 72 hours for \nCWS calls21). The Study Team agreed with the Screener’s assigned response priority in 93 \npercent of the calls (215 of 232). The Study Team disagreed with the SCR response priority for \n17 calls.  \n \n                                                 \n21 SCR policy does not dictate an immediate response priority or criteria for such urgency for CWS calls. However, \nit does indicate that an “immediate response (within 2 hours) may be appropriate, often when assigned to SPRU.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 23 \n\n \nFor 9 of the 17 calls in which there was disagreement, the Study Team’s previously described \ndisagreement with the coding decision also affected the response time priority assignment. For \nexample, a case coded a CWS referral with a 72 hour response time by the Screener was judged \na CPS report with a 24 hour response time by the Study team. This case was a report of a seven-\nyear old child who had attended school one day in September and the first part of October. The \nschool social worker had visited the child’s home on the day of the report, but the mother had not \nallowed the social worker to see the child. The mother said that the child had a broken right hand \nwhich was the reason for missing so much school. The case was coded “CWS,” but it was \nactually passed along to the field office as a “Pending Status” as part of a DCF pilot project. As \npreviously noted, this pilot project allows the field office 72 hours to determine if the referral \nshould be assigned to a field office first responder or to a community agency.  \n \nAnother example involved a child who had run away from a shelter two weeks previously and \nwas in a police station at the time of the call. This incident was determined to be a CWS referral \nand, by policy, the most urgent response would be 72 hours, but since the call came late in the \nday (nearly 5 PM) SCR was able to refer it to a “SPRU” worker who would likely make an \nimmediate response.   The Study Team believed this type of situation should have a definitive \nurgent response, and therefore believed it should be a CPS  immediate response.   \n \nIn four of the 17 calls, Study Team Reviewers agreed with the Screener’s decision regarding its \nstatus as a Child Protective Services report or a Child Welfare Services referral, but believed the \ninformation communicated by the caller suggested a more urgent response than was assigned.   \n \nAs previously described there were four calls where there was insufficient information obtained \nfor the Review Team to confirm Screener classification of the call.  Therefore, the Review Team \ncould not assess the assigned response priorities for these calls.  \n \nTable 3 below shows the change in the level of urgency evaluated to be appropriate by the Study \nTeam. \n \nTable 3: Nature of Study Team Disagreement with  \nThe SCR Screeners’ Response Priority Decision \nn = 17  \nCase  SCR  Study Team  Study Team Justification \nResponse  Response Priority\nPriority \nLess Urgent as a Result of Coding Downgrade (3) \n1  24 hours  72 hours  No indication of risk to the child, no need for heightened \n  response time. \n2  24 hours  Response priority not  Additional information on an open investigation/ case does not \napplicable  require a response time. \n3  72 hours  Response priority not  Additional information on an open investigation/ case does not \napplicable  require a response time.  \nMore Urgent as a Result of Coding Upgrade (6) \n4    72 hours  24 hours  Caller reporting that no one has seen the child in a month, \nrequiring a more immediate response \n5  72 hours  Immediate  Child in need of shelter, caller expressed an urgency requiring \na more immediate response \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 24 \n\n \nCase  SCR  Study Team  Study Team Justification \nResponse  Response Priority\nPriority \n6  72 hours  24 hours  Allegation of teenage mother abandoning newborn, but both \nteenager and newborn in the legal custody of the reporter and \nreporter requested a response as soon as possible \n7  Response  24 hours  Environmental health issues in a facility needed a time certain \npriority not  for follow-up which would require a response by a regional \napplicable  IAIU office. \n8  Response  24 hours  Report of potential abuse in a facility which would require a \n  priority not  response by a regional IAIU office.

Information Collection and Documentation \n \n•  Most of the information necessary for decision-making on whether to code the call a CPS \nreport or a CWS referral was routinely collected by Screeners. \n \nAs noted in the previous discussions, there were a few calls where the Study Review Team \nbelieved the information was insufficient to assess SCR decision-making.  However, in general, \nStudy Team Reviewers found that in 92 percent or more of the calls alleging abuse or neglect22, \nthe SCR Screeners obtained or at least asked for key information critical to supporting decision-\nmaking for coding the call correctly as a CPS report. These key items related to the age of the \nchildren involved (96%); the perpetrator’s identity (96%) and relationship to the child (99%); the \nharm or risk of harm the child suffered (98%); how (95%) and when harm occurred (96%); and \nthe need for immediate medical attention (92%) when circumstances indicated a serious injury. \nIn 5 percent or fewer of the calls, the callers were unable to provide the information requested by \nthe Screener. Figure 8 below displays this information for the calls in the CPS-designated calls in \nthe sample.  \n \nFigure 8: Information Collected by SCR Screeners in Calls coded CPS Reports \nRelated to Call Classification \nn=85 except where noted23 \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nPerpetrator's Relationship to Child 99% 1%\nHarm or Risk of Harm Child Suffered 98% 2%\nPerpetrator's Identity 96% 4%\nAge of All or Some Children (n=82) 96% 4%\nWhen the Harm Occurred 96% 4%\nHow the Harm Occurred 95% 5%\nImmediate Medical Attention (n=12) 92% 8%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \n        Source: SCR Assessment, January 2008 \n \nFor CWS calls, the SCR Screeners collected information on the age of the child (96%) and the \nurgency of intervention (96%) in an overwhelming majority of the calls. Figure 9 below displays \nthe information collected by the SCR Screeners for CWS calls. There were no instances when \nthe caller was unable to or did not provide the requested information. \n                                                 \n22 Conclusions drawn from the subgroup of 85 CPS reports are subject to a larger margin of error than the +/- 6% for \nthe entire sample because the subgroup was not randomly selected from the universe of all CPS reports during the \nperiod and the subgroup is very small. The margin of error is at least +/- 10 percent. \n23 The n varies because the information was determined to be not applicable in some instances. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 26 \n\n \n \nFigure 9: Information Collected by SCR Screeners in Calls coded CWS Referrals \nRelated to Call Classification \nn=23  \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nUrgency of Intervention 96% 4%\nAge of All or Some Children 96% 4%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \n  Source: SCR Assessment, January 2008 \n \n•  Information critical to determining the response priority for CPS calls was collected by \nScreeners less frequently than was needed for call coding. \n \nInformation that could contribute to determining the appropriate response priority to assign to a \nreport was obtained or at least asked for in 62 percent to 91 percent of the calls. As displayed in \nFigure 10, these pieces of information include perpetrator’s access to the child (91%); urgency of \nintervention (77%); frequency of harm or risk of alleged action (73%), how dangerous the \ncurrent situation was (71%); location of child at time of call (71%) and knowledge of domestic \nviolence (61%). In addition to a larger proportion of calls where Screeners did not attempt to \ncollect the information, there was a slightly larger gap between what Screeners asked for and \nwhat callers were able to provide for some elements when compared to the thoroughness of \ninformation collected for classification. For example, callers did not provide the current location \nof the child in 12 percent of the cases where Screeners asked for it and they did not provide any \nresponse to the possibility of domestic violence in 10 percent of the calls when asked by \nScreeners. \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 27 \n\n \nFigure 10: Information Collected by SCR Screeners in Calls coded CPS Reports \nRelated to Response Priority \nn=85 except where noted \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nPerpetrator's Access to Child 91% 9%\nCurrent Location of Child 71% 29%\nUrgency of Intervention (n=84) 77% 23%\nFrequency of Harm/Risk\n73% 27%\nOccurrence\nDanger of Current Situation 71% 29%\nKnowledge of Domestic\n61% 39%\nViolence\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008 \n \n \n•  All of the information needed by DYFS field office case managers to follow up on reports \nand referrals was not captured routinely.  \n \nAs seen in Figure 11 for CPS calls, there were categories of information that the SCR Screeners \ndid not routinely collect which would be helpful for the field to effectively respond to the report, \nalthough perhaps less critical to basic decision-making on classification and response priority. \nLess frequently collected information included the contact information (65%) for the child at the \ntime of the call; whether or not the child had a disability (62%), and the primary language spoken \nby the family (21%).24 Callers were most likely not able to provide a contact number for the \nchild – 16 percent were asked but did not have the information. Likewise callers were not able to \nprovide the number of children in 10 percent of the calls. Soliciting information about the \nfamily’s primary language is not currently required of Screeners although this could prove to be \nimportant information for the investigator. Screeners have the ability to link into a language \ntranslation service if a caller’s primary language is something other than English, but DYFS field \noffice case manager may not have any indication that the family of the alleged victim is not \nEnglish-speaking until they initiate the investigation.  \n                                                 \n24 This is not currently required by SCR policy. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 28 \n\n \n \nFigure 11: Information Collected by SCR Screeners in Calls coded CPS Reports \nRelated to Providing Additional Information to the Field \nn=85 except where noted \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nPrimary Address of Child 92% 8%\nNumber of Children (n=81) 78% 22%\nContact Number of Child 65% 35%\nDisability of Child (n=84) 62% 38%\nPrimary Language 21% 79%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008 \n \nSimilar to the finding for CPS reports, important location and contact information helpful to the \nfield was collected less often for CWS referrals.25 The SCR Screeners collected the family’s \naddress in 87 percent of the calls; in fewer calls information was collected on the current location \n(78%) and contact information (78%) of the family. There was a gap in ability of the callers to \nprovide current location and current contact information, however. In both circumstances 13 \npercent of the callers could not provide the information. The family’s primary language was \ncollected in 26 percent of the calls. Figure 12 depicts this information. \n \nIn CWS referrals, a key piece of information for the field’s response is to know whether the \nfamily in need of services is aware of the referral. Screeners obtained this information in less \nthan half of the calls. They did not ask for it in 52 percent of the calls. However, as described \nearlier under decision-making, approximately one-third of the CWS referrals were related to \nopen cases.  \n \n                                                 \n25 The same caveats regarding conclusions from the CPS report subgroup apply to CWS as well but the margin of \nerror will be even greater. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 29 \n\n \nFigure 12: Information Collected by SCR Screeners in Calls coded CWS Referrals \nRelated to Call Classification \nn=23  \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nFamily's Home Address 91% 9%\nContact Number of Family 78% 22%\nCurrent Location of Family 78% 22%\nNumber of Children 61% 39%\nIf Family Aware of Call to SCR 48% 52%\nPrimary Language 26% 74%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008 \n \n \n•  NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries substantially reflected what was heard on the calls in 72 \npercent of the calls but the accuracy and completeness of documentation remains a \nproblem. \n \nIn general, the SCR Screeners collect the information required to make decisions as to how to \ncode a call and in the majority of cases provide the field sufficient information on which to act. \nHowever,  in  comparing  what  was  heard  on  the  calls  to  the  written  information  that  was \ntransferred to the field through NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries, the information obtained from \nthe caller was not completely documented for more than one-quarter (28%) of the calls. Thus, \nthe documentation of the call did not always contain complete information used by the Screeners \nfor decision-making \n \nWhen the family’s primary language was identified as something other than English, it was \nreflected in the Screener’s narrative of the problem or request from the caller. However, in a \nseparate section of the Screening Summary that allows Screeners to record the family’s primary \nlanguage and indicate if an interpreter is needed, it appears that NJ SPIRIT defaults to “English” \nas the primary language and “no interpreter needed” if the Screener does not actively change it. \nDocumentation of the language issue was highlighted in one CWS example: the reporter spoke \nSpanish and the Screener used the language line to obtain information from the reporter. The \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 30 \n\n \nreporter was requesting services for her 15 year old daughter. The Screener ascertained that the \nreporter’s husband, the youth’s father, spoke Spanish and English and this was reflected in the \nnarrative  of  the  NJ  SPIRIT  Screening  Summary.  However,  the  Screening  Summary  also \nindicates that the family’s primary language is English and no interpreter is needed. Further \ninterviews of the mother may be hampered if the responding case manager is not prepared to \nspeak Spanish. \n \nLikewise,  in  a  CPS-Family  report,  the  narrative  indicated  that  the  child  had  disclosed  the \nallegation of physical abuse to his English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher. The narrative \nalso states very clearly “SPANISH SPEAKING.” Again, however, the NJ SPIRIT Screening \nSummary indicates that the family’s primary language is English and no interpreter is needed. \n \nOther examples of documentation lapse and errors that may be problematic for the field: \n•  Incomplete or inaccurate contact information for Caller or child’s current location. \n•  Incomplete  contact  information  to  coordinate  investigation  with  school  or  law \nenforcement. \n•  Discrepancy in current location of child or family.  \n•  Misspelled street name.  \n \nIn both the CPS and CWS calls, the documentation shortcomings may be a result of workload \nissues and the “time crunch” Screeners report feeling they are often under. Screeners—certified \nand uncertified alike –- strongly indicated that they need more time to complete their written \nreports. Focus group participants articulated different opinions as to how much time Screeners \nbelieve they have to write reports. Some Screeners understand policy to be that once they \ncomplete three CPS phone calls, they are permitted to take an hour to write them all up. Others \ndisagreed that this was the SCR policy. Uncertified Screeners said that new calls were too often \nwaiting “in queue” while Screeners complete reports, and that, despite policy, some Supervisors \ndo not permit Screeners to take time to write and transmit reports after completing three calls. \nFocus group participants told the Study Team that they felt this compromises the accuracy and \nthoroughness of their reports, although they understand the priority of promptly answering all \ncalls. \n \n•  Over 80 percent of the NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries contained sufficient information \nsupporting the coding and/or the response priority. \n \nEven though there was important information missing from the documentation or incorrect \ndocumentation in NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries, the Study Team found that the NJ SPIRIT \nScreening Summary supported the coding of the call in 84% of the calls and supported the \nresponse time priority in 85% of the calls. However, the purpose of the documentation is not \nonly to support decision-making, it is also intended to give the DYFS field office case manager \nknowledge  about  the  circumstances  of  the  incident  or  phone  call  in  order  to  facilitate  the \nappropriate action.  \n  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 31 \n\n \nC.  Timeliness \n \n•  A majority (80%) of the CPS reports and CWS referrals were sent to the field office within \n3 hours from the ending time of the call.  \n \nAccording to SCR staff, the one hour policy with regard to how long an SCR report or referral \nshould take to be sent to the field after a call has been completed is unrealistic and has either \nbeen suspended or is not enforced.  The Study Team was told that when a response time of \n“immediate” is given to a CPS report, a phone call is immediately made to the DYFS field office \nand the formal written report follows shortly thereafter. The Study Team did not have a means \nfor assessing or verifying this practice.  \n \nAs illustrated in Table 4, the Study Team found that 23 percent of calls that were classified as \nreports or referrals reached the field offices within 60 minutes of the Screener completing the \ncall. Another 56 percent reached the field offices within 3 hours of the call ending, for a total of \napproximately 80 percent of calls reaching the field offices within three hours from the time the \ncall ended. \n \nThere were three calls which appear to have taken between 6 and 24 hours to reach the field \noffice. Among these three calls, two appeared to be delayed as a result of supervisory review and \nupgrade  to  CPS-IAIU,  one  alleged  sexual  activity  between  a  youth  and  a  counselor  in  a \nresidential facility and the other alleged child-on-child sex in a facility. For the third call, a CPS \nreport with a 24 hour response priority, there was no apparent reason for a 6 hour time elapse \nbetween the call coming to SCR and the report arriving in the field. \n \nFive reports or referrals appear to have arrived in the field office more than 24 hours after the \ncall to the SCR. In two situations, the delay appears to be the result of supervisory review and \ndecision  to  change  the  initial  coding  to  CPS-IAIU,  arriving  in  the  regional  IAIU  office \napproximately 34 and 52 hours after the phone calls. One call arrived in the field office 28 hours \nafter the SCR call because, according to supervisory review, a new report had to be generated \nbecause the initial report was “linked” incorrectly. The other two cases reflect supervisory \nconsultation, but no clear reasons for delays of 71 and almost 76 hours, respectively.26 \n                                                 \n26 The call that appears to have taken 71 hours to reach the field was a CPS Family Report with a 24 hour response  \nassigned that was called into SCR on a Thursday at 1:12 PM.  Time of Intake was 2:39 that afternoon. It was \nassigned to the receiving local office on the following Sunday at 12:30 PM.  The call that appears to have taken \nalmost 76 hours to reach the field was a CWS Referral with a 72 hour response that was called into SCR on a Friday \nat 12:47 PM. Time of Intake was 2:16 that afternoon.  It was assigned the following Monday afternoon at almost \n5:00 PM and a case conference appears to have been held in the local office that resolved that the case would remain \na CWS referral with a 72 hour response. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 32 \n\n \nTable 4: Time between End of Call and Transmittal to Field Office* \nFor Calls Coded CPS Reports or CWS Referrals - n = 10827 \nTime Screening Summary  Cumulative \nNumber  Percent \n was Sent to Field Office28  Percent \nWithin 1 hour after call ending  25  23%   \nBetween 1 hour and 3 hours after call ending  61  56%  80% \nBetween 3 hours and 6 hours after call ending  13  12%  92% \nBetween 6 hours and 12 hours after call ending  2  2%  94% \nBetween 12 hours and 24 hours after call ending  1  1%  94% \nBetween 24 hours and 76 hours after call ending  5  5%  99% \nMissing data29 1  1%  100% \nTotal 108  100%   \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n \nTable 5 provides the transmittal times for CPS reports alone.

Professionalism and Competence of SCR Screeners \n \nThe Study Team evaluated the Screeners’ professional demeanor on a number of dimensions \nincluding: \n \n1) relevancy and logical sequence of questions to caller,  \nThis dimension measured how well the Screener’s questions followed the flow of \nthe  caller’s  narrative.  Economy  and  effectiveness  of  the  questions  were \nconsidered more important than the quantity of questions. Reviewers listened for \nScreener questions that pertained directly to the reason or circumstance that \nprompted the call and what was needed to form an adequate basis for decision-\nmaking about the call. Reviewers also listened for how the Screener may have had \nto re-direct the caller to keep him/her focused on the pertinent issues.  \n \n2) calmness and objectivity during call,  \nThis dimension focused on the Screener’s tone of voice and exhibition of emotion. \nReviewers listened for such qualities as a conversational tone, Screener speaking \npace, and fluctuation that indicated excitement. \n \n3) empathy, care and concern demonstrated to caller,  \nThis dimension focused on the Screener’s efforts to engage the caller in order to \nobtain the maximum amount of pertinent information. Reviewers listened for the \nuse of reflective listening skills, appropriately but not excessively repeating caller \nconcerns to indicate that they had heard what caller had to say, and a calm, \nengaging voice. \n \n4) direct and clear communication with caller,  \nThis dimension focused on the Screener’s speech pattern. Reviewers listened for \nwhether the Screeners mumbled, spoke too fast, spoke to be clearly heard, and \nused respectful conventions such as “pardon me” to interrupt the caller when \nnecessary. \n \n5) effort to ensure accuracy of information,  \nThis dimension focused on how the Screener attempted to make sure he/she had \nreceived  the  information  as  the  caller  had  provided.  Reviewers  listened  for \nScreener efforts to repeat back information to the caller or asked for spelling or \nnames. \n \n6) respectful call conclusion \nThis dimension focused on how the Screener ended the call.  Was it courteous?  \nDid the Screener say “thank you,” at a minimum? \n \nA three point scale was applied to “rate” Screeners on each of the first five dimensions. A rating \nof “1” was used to indicate that the dimension was completely satisfied; a rating of “2” meant it \nwas partially satisfied; and a rating of “3” meant it was not satisfied. The sixth dimension used a \n“yes”/”no” criteria.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 34 \n\n \n \n•  The majority of calls were handled thoroughly and professionally, but performance on \nsome dimensions needs strengthening. \n \nAs shown in Table 6 below, 72 percent or more of the calls completely met the criteria along all \ndimensions. In nearly all calls Screeners demonstrated calmness and objectivity (91%) and in 93 \npercent of calls, Screeners ended the call respectfully. \n \nThe Screeners appear to need improvement in asking relevant questions in a sequence which \nfollows the flow of the call (72% met criteria) and in summarizing pertinent information back to \nthe  caller  (72%  met  criteria).  Screeners  could  also  improve  their  efforts  to  listen  and \ncommunicate with callers with empathy, care, and concern.  \n \nTable 6: Screener Response to Calls \nn=232 \nNumber  Percent \ny  y \nel y  el y \nScreeners demonstrated  plet tiall No  otal  plet tiall No  otal \nm r T m r T\na a\no P o P\nC C\nRelevancy and logical sequence  5\n168  54  11  232  72%  23%  100% \nof questions of caller  % \nCalmness and objectivity during  2\n211  16  5  232  91%  7%  100% \ncall  % \nEmpathy, care and concern to  4\n181  42  9  232  78%  18%  100% \ncaller  % \nDirect and clear Communication  3\n208  19  65  232  89%  8%  100% \nwith caller Parties  % \n28\nEfforts to ensure accuracy  162    64  22632  72%    100% \n% \n7\nRespectful end to call   213    15  22833  93%    100% \n% \n  Source: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n \n \nExamples of both solid professional performance and those where professionalism was lacking \nwere cited by the Study Team. \n \n                                                 \n32 6 calls were considered not applicable because they were internal calls or, in one case, the caller hung-up before \nScreener could repeat information. \n33 4 calls were considered not applicable because they were internal requests for information. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 35 \n\n \nStudy Team comments about strong performance include: \n \n•  Screener was very thorough and documentation was very accurate.  \n \n•  This Screener is excellent. Assured, firm, engaging and very successful in getting a lot \nof specific information from a caller who preferred to be much vaguer than Screener \nneeded her to be. Model Screener.  \n \n•  Screener was very pleasant and helpful. Screener gave caller good direction and \nasked questions to focus on getting the information that the caller was struggling to \nprovide. \n \n•  Very efficient, courteous handling of call. However, overall quality is compromised \nby documentation.  \n \n•  Screener was logical, respectful and supportive. She asked very good questions and \nsupported the caller during difficult moment when discussing specifics of sexual \nabuse her child has experienced.  \n \n•  Screener politely and clearly obtained needed information but rarely used reflective \nlisting skills.  \n \n•  Screener was great. Found out information from Supervisor to do a warm transfer to \nDifferential Response pilot. When she was given wrong number, she persevered and \neventually connected caller to Differential Response worker in county.  \n \n•  This  Screener  was  excellent  in  steering  caller  to  salient  facts  in  a  clear  but \nempathetic and respectful way.  \n \n•  Screener did excellent job; asked good, clarifying questions of caller. Screener was \nvery empathetic of caller who sounded very concerned for child.  \n \n•  Caller was excitable, sometime rambling, almost always vague. Screener did good \njob in focusing the caller to specific facts and/or allegations. \n \nStudy Team comments about weaker performance include: \n \n•  Twice  the  Screener  exceeded  professional  boundaries  commiserating  with  police \nabout difficult teens (alleged victim was a 15 yr old girl who allegedly had been \nslapped by brother-in-law as a “ wake up call”), noting how glad she was not to have \nteenagers anymore.  \n \n•  Screener exhibited impatience and cut off caller.  \n \n•  Caller was a boy, age 15, who had been kicked out of his adoptive house. The \nScreener displayed no patience; inappropriately hurrying and interrupting.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 36 \n\n \n \n•  Screener could have used more empathetic language. Caller's daughter, son-in-law \nand grandchildren were losing their home and Screener spoke matter-of-factly about \nseparating the family. Screener confused caller with advice about having parents call \nfor help and whether children would be removed from parents due to homelessness. \nCaller was surprised to learn that if you call and ask for help, a possible result would \nbe the separation of children from parents. The Screener was not sympathetic to the \nCatch-22 caller was pointing out.  \n \n•  Caller was from a group home reporting a fight between two teenage residents. The \nScreener did not ask some relevant questions and attempted to create the scenario in \na way that prompted the attack of one girl on the other. The Caller stated that was not \nthe case and that the attack appeared to be unprovoked. The Screener mumbled, as if \ntalking to himself, and was not clear on what he was doing so that caller apologized \nfor her misunderstanding.  \n \n•  Although pertinent information was gathered, the Screener often interrupted caller \nwith questions, and was restating bits and pieces while caller attempted to continue \nwith story as though the Screener was talking to herself out loud as she recorded \ninformation. Care and concern were apparent, as was the interest to get the story \nstraight, although there was more repeating for the sake of recording than reflective \nlistening.  \n \n•  Callers were trying to explain that child will be homeless in 2 days and the Screener \nwas saying there was nothing she could do. Screener took awhile to grasp what \ncaller's concern was about. \n \n•  Screener sounded impatient and asked questions designed to elicit more specific \ninformation in a challenging way to caller.  \n \nE.  The Effect of Screener Certification \n \nAs previously described, the SCR has established two Screener levels – certified and uncertified. \nWithin the study sample, 98 calls were handled by certified Screeners and 134 were handled by \nuncertified Screeners. Focus groups of Screeners expressed frustration that bifurcating the role of \nScreener by skill level was not helpful to morale and did not serve any meaningful purpose. In \naddition, there was a lack of clarity about how Screeners become certified. Those who knew that \nit was the responsibility of Supervisors to rate Screeners and make recommendations noted that \nsome people had not achieved certification status solely because their Supervisors had not had \nthe time to do the rating and prepare the packet for review and approval by the designated case \nwork Supervisor. Therefore the analysis in this section is intended to provide information on the \neffect that Screener certification has on operations. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 37 \n\n \n \n•  Calls handled by uncertified Screeners generally were longer. \n \nAs indicated in Table 7 below, calls handled by uncertified Screeners generally lasted longer. \nThe one exception to this pattern was duration of the calls that were eventually coded “No \nAction Required.” Certified workers spent longer on this type of call.  This finding is not \nsurprising given the required supervisory consultation for uncertified Screener decision-making. \n \nTable 7:  \nCall Duration by Type of Call Resolution and Screener Certification Status \n \nApplicable  Average \nCall Type  Median   \nCalls (#)  Certified Uncertified \n \nCPS  85  11 m  11 m  14 m \n \nChild Welfare  23  15 m  12 m  15 m   \nI & R  70  3 m  4 m  4 m   \nRelated Information  44  7 m  8 m  9 m   \nNo Action Required  10  10 m  17 m  10 m   \nGrand Total  232  7 m  8 m  9 m   \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n \n•  Certified Screeners appear to make more accurate coding and response priority \ndeterminations \n \nThe proportion of calls in the sample handled by uncertified Screeners was 58 percent. However, \nthe  uncertified  Screeners  represented  a  larger  proportion  of  the  23  calls  that  Study  Team \ndisagreed with or could not assess either the coding or the response priority designation. Among \nthe  23  calls,  15  (65%)  were  calls  handled  by  uncertified  Screeners.  This  is  a  particularly \ninteresting finding given that all uncertified decisions must be reviewed by Supervisors. This \nmay be reflective of what focus groups suggested were inconsistencies among Supervisors.  \n \n•  Uncertified Screeners are as thorough as certified Screeners in collecting key pieces of \ninformation for CPS reports \n \nAmong the 85 calls in the sample that were coded as CPS reports, 44 were handled by certified \nScreeners and 41 were handled by uncertified Screeners. Figures 13 and 14 summarize the \nfrequency of information collection by each subgroup of Screeners for the CPS-designated calls \nin the sample. As indicated, neither subgroup was universally better than the other. For example, \ncertified Screeners collected information more often about the child’s current location (80% \ncompared to 61%) while the uncertified Screeners collected information about whether or not a \nchild had a disability (69% compared to 52%). Overall, uncertified Screeners did as well or \nbetter than certified Screeners on 14 of the 18 items listed. In addition to the child’s current \nlocation, certified Screeners more often collected information about when the harm occurred, \ndanger of the current situation, and the family’s primary language. \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 38 \n\n \nFigure 13: Information Collected by SCR Screeners on CPS Calls  \nby Certified Screeners \nn=44 \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nPrimary Language 27% 73%\nKnowledge of Domestic Violence 52% 48%\nPerpetrator's Access to Child 86% 14%\nDisability of Child (n=42) 52% 48%\nImmediate Medical Attention (n=11) 64% 36%\nUrgency of Intervention  75% 25%\nDanger of Current Situation 70% 30%\nHow the Harm Occurred 95% 5%\nFrequency of Harm/Risk Occurrence 70% 30%\nWhen the Harm Occurred 100% 0%\nHarm or Risk of Harm Child Suffered 97% 2%\nPerpetrator's Relationship to Child 98% 2%\nPerpetrator's Identity 95% 5%\nPrimary Address of Child 91% 9%\nContact Number of Child 66% 34%\nCurrent Location of Child 80% 20%\nAge of All or Some Children (n=41) 92% 7%\nNumber of Children (n=42) 71% 29%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100\n%  \n  Source: SCR Assessment, January 2008.\n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 39 \n\n \n \nFigure 14: Information Collected by SCR Screeners on CPS Calls \nby Uncertified Screeners  \nn= 41 \nCollected or Asked For Not Asked For\nPrimary Language 15% 85%\nKnowledge of Domestic Violence 53% 46%\nPerpetrator's Access to Child 95% 5%\nDisability of Child (n=39) 69% 31%\nImmediate Medical Attention (n=4) 100% 0%\nUrgency of Intervention (40) 80% 20%\nDanger of Current Situation 70% 29%\nHow the Harm Occurred 95% 5%\nFrequency of Harm/Risk Occurrence 75% 24%\nWhen the Harm Occurred 93% 7%\nHarm or Risk of Harm Child Suffered 98% 2%\nPerpetrator's Relationship to Child 100% 0%\nPerpetrator's Identity 98% 2%\nPrimary Address of Child  92% 7%\nContact Number of Child 63% 37%\nCurrent Location of Child 61% 39%\nAge of All or Some Children (n=40) 100% 0%\nNumber of Children (n=39) 85% 15%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n  \n  Source: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 40 \n\n \n \n•  CPS reports generated by certified Screeners reach the field offices more quickly than \nthose generated by uncertified Screeners.  \n \nAs shown in Table 8, of the 44 calls handled by certified Screeners, 16 (37%) were received by \nthe field office within an hour compared to 6 (15%) of the 41 calls handled by uncertified \nScreeners. This performance is not unexpected because uncertified Screeners must have their \ndecisions reviewed by Supervisors before they are transmitted to the field. The proportion of \nreports that reached the field within 3 hours is also greater for certified Screeners: 89 percent of \nthe reports from certified Screeners and 78 percent of the reports by uncertified Screeners \nreached the field within 3 hours. \n \nOf the 3 CPS calls which took the longest to be received by the field office, 2 were handled by \nuncertified Screeners.

For  example,  nearly  the  same  proportion  of  each \nsubgroup demonstrated calmness, objectivity, and direct and clear communication. Uncertified \nScreeners, however, appeared to demonstrate more relevancy in their line of inquiry; more \nempathy care and concern; and greater efforts to ensure accuracy. \n \nTable 9: Screener Response to Calls \nSource: SCR Assessment, January 2008. \nCertified (n=98)  Uncertified (n=134) \ny  y \nel y  el y \nScreeners demonstrated  plet tiall No  otal  plet tiall No  otal \nm r T m r T\na a\no P o P\nC C\nRelevancy and logical \nsequence of questions of  67%  30%  3%  100%  76%  19%  5%  100% \ncaller \nCalmness and objectivity \n91%  6%  3%  100%  91%  7%  1%  100% \nduring call \nEmpathy, care and concern \n76%  20%  4%  100%  80%  16%  4%  100% \nto caller \nDirect and clear \nCommunication with caller  91%  7%  2%  100%  89%  9%  2%  100% \nParties \nEfforts to ensure accuracy  69%    31%  100%37  74%    26%  100%38 \nRespectful end to call   93%    7%  100%39  94%    6%  100% \n \n                                                 \n37 Valid calls for calculation is 96 because two calls were considered not applicable since they were internal calls, or \nwere hang-ups \n38 Valid calls for calculation is 130 because 4 calls were not considered applicable. \n39 Valid call for calculation is 94 since 4 calls were not applicable because they were internal requests. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 42 \n\n \nV.  Factors Affecting Performance \n \nA.  Strengths of the SCR \n \nThe operations, daily functioning and decision-making of the SCR was found to be competent \nand professional. It was vastly improved since it was last evaluated by the Child Welfare Reform \nPanel in 2005. The Study Team noted many strengths including: \n \n•  Strong and competent leadership as demonstrated by: \no  Systematic methods of quality assurance, including: \n(cid:131)  daily peer reviews of calls that are not initially sent to the field; and \n(cid:131)  supervisory review and evaluation of calls; \no  Effective use of the available technology; \no  Improved real time supervision through additional call floor Supervisors and \nassignment of a dedicated Casework Supervisor to training and supervision of \npart-time staff; and \no  Improved guidance to Screeners on how to apply the Allegation Based System \nof evaluating and determining reports of child abuse or neglect and child \nwelfare services. \n•  Overall, a high degree of professionalism of administrators and screening staff; \n•  Available technology \no  A sophisticated telephone system that appears to effectively route calls as well \nas assist with staff supervision and management; \no  An  effective  recording  system  that  permits  recall  and  evaluation  of  any \nincoming call to the SCR; and \no  A state of the art management information system that, despite its need for \nregular modifications, is reliable and performs well. \n \nB.  Opportunities for Improvement \n \nDespite the Study Team’s finding that the SCR decision-making in 92 percent of calls reviewed \nwas generally sound and consistent, the Study Team identified several important areas where \nthere are opportunities for improvement. These opportunities include: \n \n•  The  SCR  written  policies,  definitions,  and  expectations.  Although  staff  have \nreceived training and guidance on applying the Allegation Based system and many \nfocus group participants acknowledge improved consistency around CPS reports, \nthere are still inconsistent and ill defined standards and criteria. For example, the \nstandard for accepting a call to the hotline is defined in more than one way.40 There is \nalso no longer an established policy for expected timeliness in transmitting reports to \nthe field. Some focus group participants reported that there is an informal expectation \namong the SCR staff that calls are transferred to investigative staff in the field within \ntwo hours. Others said it was shorter and still others were unaware of any expectation. \n                                                 \n40 E.g. N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10 cited in the introduction to the Field Operations Casework Policy and Procedures Manual at \ntab 2 Section 203.1 of the Manual, where the “reasonable cause to believe” standard is found is in conflict with the \n“circumstances that suggest harm” language in tab 2 Section 208 of the same Field Operations Manual.  \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 43 \n\n \nSome of the confusion over policy indentified in the focus groups may be tied to the \ninconsistency in written policy and other reference material.  \n \nFinally, although DYFS policy at the time of the review allows the field office to \nrespond to a CWS referral sooner than 72 hours, SCR does not appear to have a clear \nset of written criteria for when it should assign a more immediate response time than \n72 hours. The options Screeners have when they believe that the appropriate coding is \nCWS but that a more urgent response time is indicated are to document the request in \nthe narrative, call the DYFS field office to indicate the urgency, and/or send it to the \nSPRU worker assigned which typically generates a more urgent response. Another \ninformal “work around” used by Screeners is to code the call a CPS report and assign \na more urgent response time priority. As indicated in Figure 5, one third of the CWS \nreferrals in the sample were designated as “immediate” by Screeners and sent to \nSPRU staff. Likewise, as indicated by the analysis, Screeners appear to use CWS \nreferrals for open cases when circumstances suggest a more immediate response than \nthe assigned case manager may be able to provide, even though there is nothing in \npolicy to support this use. \n \n•  The SCR Operations Manual. The Study Team found the manual to be outdated, \ndisorganized,  hard  to  use  and  in  need  of  significant  editing,  restructuring  and \nclarification. Even the updated version provided to the Study Team was not current; it \nmakes reference to the old DYFS adoption units called “ARCS” as if they still existed \nand lists a previous Director, Jim Davy, on the cover as the current DYFS Director. \n \n•  Training. The DYFS workforce and others statewide are being intensively trained on \nDCF’s new Case Practice Model. The SCR should be part of that larger training \nprocess. SCR Screeners and staff who are new DCF employees will receive initial \nCase Practice Model training in the Pre-Service new worker training curriculum. \nHowever, other Screeners and staff with more tenure who joined the SCR prior to the \ncurrent Pre-Service training curriculum or transferred in from another unit will not \nhave received Case Practice Model training unless they are included in broader In-\nservice training. \n \nWithin the SCR, a training unit has been designated to provide new Screeners with \nbasic job training and information on the policies current at the time of the training. \nHowever, Screeners report that the primary means of training on new SCR policy or \nDCF  initiatives  is  supervisory  action;  Supervisors  typically  conduct  supervisory \nmeetings  and  distribute  minutes  to  ensure  new  directives  are  disseminated. \nUncertified Screeners report that they often receive changes to policy or updates by \nemail or through paper correspondence, which they experience as haphazard. For \nexample, Screeners reported that they had no formal training when DYFS’s new \nDifferential  Response  initiative  was  introduced  although  according  to  SCR \nAdministrators,  training  was  provided.  Certified  and  uncertified  Screeners  were \nuncertain as to which calls to code as CWS and whether Supervisors were able to \nupgrade a CWS report to one requiring an immediate response. Certified Screeners \nreport that because of this kind of confusion they would sometimes code reports as \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 44 \n\n \nNARs to ensure that they would be evaluated a second time. Finally, some focus \ngroup participants reported that they were never formally trained on NJ SPIRIT and \nthat they had to learn “while doing.” They felt whatever training they had was not \ngiven the priority it should have had, and was “squeezed” in between other priorities. \n \n•  NJ  SPIRIT  functionality.  Although  it  appears  to  be  operating  well,  Screeners, \nespecially certified Screeners and Supervisors who have been at the SCR since before \nintroduction of NJ SPIRIT, reported some loss of critical functionality in searching \nfor  information  and  linkages  with  other  data  systems.  For  example,  a  childcare \nservice provider with offices statewide was coded in NJ SPIRIT as having offices \nonly in Camden, necessitating Screeners to hunt through many addresses to find the \ncorrect location to provide a caller seeking a referral. Until this is corrected, they have \nto “work around” an otherwise simple operation, spending valuable time they could \nhave devoted to calls or reports. SCR leadership reports that these issues are being \naddressed and they expect an early fall 2008 deployment of an enhanced search \nfunction in NJ SPIRIT that will not return multiple instances of the same provider.  \nThis should eliminate the need for Screeners to  scroll through each record \n \nIn addition, new programmatic initiatives designed primarily to be implemented in \nDYFS field offices have had implications for NJ SPIRIT functionality at the SCR and \nit takes time for NJ SPIRIT to catch up to the innovations. Two examples of this are \nthe Differential Response (DR) Pilot and the “CWS Pending” pilot. Both initiatives \nare designed to give the DYFS field offices more autonomy in responding to reports \nand  referrals  from  the  SCR.  However,  NJ  SPIRIT  was  not  designed  with  these \ninitiatives in mind. Therefore, the SCR had to use a code within the “No Action \nRequired” classifications to be able to transmit the NJ SPIRIT Screening Summary to \nthe  DR  pilot  counties  after  the  “warm  transfer”  of  the  callers  to  the  counties. \nLikewise, there was no designated code for “CWS Pending” except to indicate when \na summary was awaiting a supervisory approval. When the pilot was initiated SCR \nSupervisors  found  themselves  with  electronic  “in-boxes”  full  of  “pending” \nsummaries, which in fact had been transmitted to the appropriate field offices to \nassess or refer within 72 hours.  \n \n•  Use of the SCR for administrative functions. In its role as DCF’s only 24-hour per \nday, 7-day per week operation, the Study Team observed an overuse of the hotline for \nadministrative  functions.  Every  call  taken  by  a  Screener  from  a  SPRU  worker \nregistering for a shift or responding to a request for another DCF phone number takes \ntime away from other SCR calls in queue. In addition, Screeners are required to \ncomplete a NJ SPIRIT Screening Summary for each of these calls, which is an \nunnecessary diversion from more urgent calls and screening summaries that need to \nbe  written.  This  is  especially  important  given  the  issues  noted  previously  about \nincomplete documentation and the Screener’s view that some of this is caused by \nexcessive workload demands. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 45 \n\n \n \nVI.  Recommendations \n \nThe Study Team’s recommendations fall into three broad areas: Policy, Operations, and Staff \nDevelopment. \n \nA.  Policy \n \n•  Establish realistic and consistent timeframe expectations for transmittal of reports and \nreferrals to the DYFS field offices and review staffing to ensure adequate resources are \nin place to meet expectations. \n \nThe current expectation for SCR “call turn around” is not clear. The data show that the majority \nof calls take up to three hours from the time the call ends to the time the report reaches the field. \nHowever, the Study Team was consistently told that Screeners call the field immediately when \nthey are about to send a report that requires immediate attention. It is recommended that a clear \nexpectation be set in written policy on the expected timeframes for reports to be transmitted to \nfield staff by report type and response priority time. Along with the expectation should come a \nmeans of measuring how successful SCR is in both meeting the response time and in answering \ncalls promptly. In setting a clear timeframe, steps must be taken to ensure that Screeners have \nsufficient time to accurately document the information they have gleaned from the calls so that \naccurate information can be conveyed to the field in a timely manner. The SCR may want to \nclarify    its  policy  as  to  how  many  calls  Screeners  are  expected  to  take  before  beginning \ndocumentation responsibilities.  It may want to consider a policy of Screeners documenting each \ncall immediately after it is received. The SCR may also want to do its own analysis of this issue, \ninvolving  Screeners  and  Supervisors  alike  to  examine  how  other  states  manage  this  issue. \nIllinois, for example, employs the same Allegation Based system as New Jersey and has chosen \nto set different time frames for reports to reach the field depending on the nature of the call, but \nthere are certainly many ways to establish a set policy on this critical hotline function.41 \n \n•  Continue to clarify CWS referral criteria including formally designating a response \ntime for those CWS referrals that require a more urgent response than 72 hours. \n \nAlthough Child Welfare Services referrals are typically less urgent than allegations of abuse or \nneglect, they are not always. And, there can be a fine line between a family’s need for services \nand an appropriate allegation of child neglect. The difference can be the timing of the response. \nSCR management and Supervisors recognize this challenge and have developed work-around \nmethods to generate faster responses. This should not be dependent on individual Supervisors, \nhowever and it is recommended that the Department consider developing policy and criteria for \ndesignating urgent CWS reports with a shorter response time and effect the change. In addition, \nField Operations and SCR together should clarify whether an “immediate” CWS referral is the \nappropriate mechanism for responding to an urgent need in an open case. \n \n                                                 \n41 Pp.39 – 42 of Illinois Hotline Manual. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 46 \n\n \n•  Clarify policies and criteria for reports of alleged abuse or neglect involving resource \nparents and other institutional providers which by policy are to be directed to the \nspecialized Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) for investigation. \n \nAs indicated by the data, coding reports for IAIU requires greater SCR attention. The reports in \nthe  sample  that  were  appropriately  upgraded  for  an  IAIU  response  by  SCR  Supervisors \ndemonstrate a strength of SCR’s internal quality assurance efforts. However, valuable time was \nused to arrive at the final coding. Reports of youth fighting within a group home must be shared \nwith their respective case managers, but the facilities’ actions or lack of action must also be \nreviewed. The allegation should be the primary criteria for decision-making, not the location of \nthe allegation. It is recommended that the Department further review the types of calls that are \nbeing  coded  Related  Information  and  compare  them  to  those  coded  CPS-IAIU  to  begin \nformulating clearer policies and criteria for screening calls as CPS-IAIU. \n \n•  Streamline classification categories.  \n \nThe Study Team experienced confusion in deciding how to categorize Information and Referral \n(I&R), Information Only (IO) and Related Information phone calls. Screeners do not consistently \ncode calls within these three categories. Some calls coded as IO were really I&R or Related \nInformation calls. Additionally, the data show that around 20 percent or more of the Information \nOnly calls were from DYFS field offices and were made for administrative purposes. As the \npurpose of the SCR is to respond to allegations of abuse or neglect or requests for services or \nreferrals, DCF may want to consider a different mechanism for DYFS field offices to perform \nsome of these administrative tasks. The Study Team recommends at a minimum to eliminate the \nInformation Only (IO) classification. \n \nB.  SCR Operations \n \n•  Reorganize and update operations manual \n \nEditing  the  Operations  Manual  should  include  a  wholesale  updating  of  the  information  it \ncontains so that outdated information is deleted and new information regarding the Differential \nResponse and other pilot programs and information reflecting current policy and practice are \nincluded. We recommend researching other states’ manuals for models, and suggests a close \nexamination of the Illinois hotline manual for its clarity and organization. In addition, this report \nhighlights areas that should also be a primary focus in updating the Operations Manual.  \n \n•  Continue to enhance NJ SPIRIT functionality for SCR  \n \nAs discussed in detail above, Screeners have legitimate concerns about how NJ SPIRIT affects \ntheir work.  Although staff have been creative in developing “work arounds” to the current \nfunctionality challenges and enhancements are planned, the timetable for the enhancements \nshould not be allowed to slip.  NJ SPIRIT limitations for SCR need to be addressed by the \nDepartment in a timely manner. \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 47 \n\n \nIn addition, it is recommended that when the Department is in the planning stages of new pilot \nprojects or their expansion, it incorporates what has been learned from the SCR experience with \nDifferential Response (DR) and the CWS Pending pilot.  Both experiences, as reported by SCR \nleadership, offer some useful reflections.  For the DR pilot, SCR leadership reports that staff \njointly developed a methodology to track DR calls using existing functionality that would not \nrequire changes to NJ SPIRIT, and did so before the implementation of DR.  With regard to the \nCWS pilot, SCR reported raising issues with NJ SPIRIT staff only after the initial deployment to \nfour pilot offices and after the “pending” designation had caused the total pending referrals \nattached to supervisory groups to spike.  As a result, teams from SCR and NJ SPIRIT met to \ndiscuss  how  to  address  the  situation  and  jointly  agreed  that  the  necessary  changes  to  the \napplication could be delayed until the expansion of the CWS pilot to additional areas caused the \nvolume of “pending” referrals to become unmanageable.  According to SCR, this work is slated \nfor design, development, and implementation, and the time frame will be determined by the \ntiming of the expansion of the CWS pilot.     \n \nWithout sacrificing innovation and experimentation to identify best practice for New Jersey, it is \nclear  that  the  complexity  of  interactions  requires  joint  planning  and  communication  when \nconsidering a pilot effort.  This will minimize unintended consequences and help to create \nrealistic expectations for both SCR and the field. \n \n•  Consider developing and using alternative mechanisms for non-urgent business, such as \nSPRU registration or internal DCF queries. \n \nCoupled with the elimination of IO calls, the Department needs to develop a new mechanism for \nSPRU communications. Of the sample NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries reviewed by the Study \nTeam, 34 (13%) were calls relating to after hour investigators (Special Response Unit – SPRU) \nregistering for shifts or indicating that they had been unable to reach family and “re-referring” \nthe report or referral. The SCR Unit has a designated phone number for SPRU staff to call to \nregister, but it appears that calls are also received on the same hotline the public uses.   Although \nthese  calls  are  brief,  they  can  be  a  distraction  to  Screeners  trying  to  get  their  own  work \ncompleted.  In addition, the number of SPRU calls may affect accurate reporting of the volume \nof calls SCR receives. \n \nC.  Staff Development \n \n•  All SCR staff need regular and on-going training opportunities to ensure application of \nSCR polices and practices consistent with the DCF’s Case Practice Model. \n \nCreative,  real  time  teaching  needs  to  be  a  regular  part  of  each  work  week.  In  an  agency \nundergoing significant cultural and operational changes, policies often change. It is, therefore, \nrecommended that the SCR institute regular unit based training opportunities to ensure that all \nScreeners and staff are trained in new policies and practice. Additionally, there needs to be more \nsystematic ongoing in-service training opportunities developed for continued on the job training \nat the SCR for both full time and part time Screeners and Supervisors, particularly when there is \na change in SCR policy or practice.  \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 48 \n\n \nIt is also recommended that SCR leadership respond to staff requests for more in-service training \non New Jersey SPIRIT. Lastly, DYFS is engaged in a statewide intensive effort to train its \nworkforce on DCF’s new Case Practice Model. The Study Team is not aware of any efforts to \ninclude SCR Screeners and staff in that process and it is recommended that all Screeners, their \nSupervisors and other staff have opportunities to be trained on the new Case Practice Model.  \n \n•  Strengthen internal methods to support quality of work and staff competency: \nexpanded peer review and Screener and Supervisor evaluation. \n \nThe SCR currently has three vehicles for ensuring the quality of work: regular supervisory \nreview  of  NJ  Screening  Summaries  written  by  uncertified  Screeners;  systematic  worker \nevaluations using the mechanism that is part of the call recording system; and peer review of \nsummaries that are coded as I&R and I&O. In addition, the Supervisors occasionally engage in \ncase practice reviews of challenging cases. All of these are excellent mechanisms for not only \nquality assurance but also for staff development, but they can be strengthened.  \n \nWorker evaluations and peer review of the “no action” calls could be strengthened in two ways. \nFirst, given the degree of discrepancy that the Study Review Team identified between what was \nheard  on  the  call  and  what  was  documented,  more  attention  is  needed  to  improving \ndocumentation.  Reviews  of  decision-making  should  not  rely  on  taped  calls  only  or  the \ndocumentation only. The daily peer review should consider listening to a sample of the calls in \naddition  to  reviewing  the  documentation  and  should  be  expanded  to  involve  all  levels  of \nscreening staff, and using select calls to model desired practice.  \n \nWith some additional steps, the daily peer review can also become a useful mechanism for \ngathering  data  on  the  consistency  among  staff  and  supervisory  decision-making  and  the \nconsistency of supervisory units doing the peer review. The SCR should consider the following \nsteps: \n \n1.  Aggregate the data from daily peer reviews by supervisory unit.  \n•  This could include how often a particular Screener’s and supervisory unit’s work \nis reviewed.  On its own, this information may not be sufficient to draw definitive \nconclusions, but patterns may help to indicate areas for inquiry and development \n•  It  could  also  include  how  often  a  particular’s  Screener’s  decision-making  is \nquestioned  by  the  peer  reviewers.  Again,  aggregating  this  information  by \nsupervisory  units  may  reflect  some  patterns  worth  investigating  further  for \ndevelopmental purposes. \n2.  Aggregating the decision-making results of the peer review units, by unit.  \nThis could include aggregating all decisions-reviewed by units doing the review for \npatterns. For example, does a particular unit tend to question its peers more often than \nothers? Again, such information should not lead to definitive conclusions but rather \npatterns that trigger further investigation.  \n \nFurthermore, SCR should consider investigating how the worker evaluation protocol that is a \nfeature of the call recording system could be modified to be more tailored to the work of SCR \nrather than a generic telemarketing type of operation. \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 49 \n\n \n \n•  Evaluate the criteria and process for Screener certification and Supervisor \nqualification. \n \nThe decision to certify Screeners to recognize skills and to support more timely transmission of \nreports and referrals to the field is appropriate. Furthermore, it appears that certified Screeners \nmake appropriate decisions more often than uncertified Screeners. However, the Study Team \nfound  little  measurable  difference  between  certified  and  uncertified  Screener  in  terms  of \nthoroughness and professionalism in conducting calls. In addition, the Study Team heard some \nconcerns from staff about the certification process and status. Therefore, it is important for the \nSCR to review its current process and establish clear criteria for certification, perhaps through a \ncommittee of Supervisors and Screeners, including both certified and uncertified. Further, if the \nDepartment  continues  to  allow  less  frequent  supervisory  review  of  decisions  by  certified \nScreeners, it will need to establish procedures for periodic re-certification. \n \nAdditionally,  it  is  important  for  the  SCR  to  review  the  qualifications  for  Supervisors  and \nevaluate their performance. The Study Team found that uncertified Screeners represented a \nlarger proportion of the 23 calls that the Study Team disagreed with or could not assess either the \ncoding or the response priority designation. Given that uncertified decisions must be reviewed by \nSupervisors, this finding may indicate inconsistencies among Supervisors which might pertain to \nboth their qualifications and their performance. Attention must be paid to the process of how \nSupervisors are evaluating their workers, but also to their own decision-making.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page 50 \n\n \nAppendix A: Methodology \n \nThe assessment involved several components.  This appendix provides a detailed description of \neach component. \n \nA.  Call and Documentation Review \n \nThe core component of the assessment was a structured review of a sample of calls and the \ndocumentation produced as a result of the calls.  To accomplish this task, the Study Review \nTeam designed a sampling plan, developed a structured data collection instrument, employed a \nquality  assurance  approach  to  ensure  inter-rater  reliability,  and  developed  a  data  base  for \nanalysis.  These activities were accomplished as follows: \n \n1.  Sample Plan and Implementation. \n \nEvery call received or made on an SCR phone is automatically recorded using the NICE system.  \nScreeners  then  classify  and  document  in  a  Screening  Summary  in  NJ  SPIRIT  (the  State’s \nautomated case processing system) all incoming calls. In designing the sample, the Study Team \nchose to draw the sample from among the NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries rather than the from \namong the taped calls to better ensure the sample would have a sufficient number of useable calls \non which to base analysis and conclusions.  Drawing the sample from among the taped calls \nwould have produced a sample with a percentage of outgoing calls that would not be useful to \nthe purposes of this assessment.  However, drawing a sample from the NJ SPIRT Screening \nSummary data base had limitations as well because these summaries can be generated as the \nresult of correspondence such as a court ordered home evaluation.  Never the less, a sample of \n300 NJ SPIRIT Screening Summaries was randomly selected from 34,114 Screening Summaries \ngenerated between October 1 and November 30, 2007.  \n \nThe sample size was designed to have no more than a 6 percent margin of error with 95 percent \nconfidence.  \n \nBefore beginning data collection, each call that was associated with each of the selected NJ \nSPIRIT Screening Summaries and copied over the calls into a separate file of calls designed for \nuse by the Study Review Team.  Data collection was not completed for 32 Screening Summaries \nin the sample primarily because call quality was poor, it was an internal administrative call, it \nwas an outgoing call, or the Screening Summary selected for the sample was generated by \ncorrespondence rather than a telephone call. This reduction was not great enough to affect the \nmargin of error.  \n \n2.  Data Collection  \n \nA  structured  data  collection  instrument  was  designed  in  collaboration  with  senior  SCR \nmanagement, the Office of Child Advocate, and a member of the DCF Quality Analysis and \nInformation unit. The data collection instrument allowed reviewers to compare what they heard \nto written documentation, to assess whether decisions were made in accordance with law and \npolicy and to evaluate the competency and professionalism of the SCR Screener.  In addition, the \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page A-1 \n\n \nteam  used  the  instrument  to  compare  the  information  provided  by  the  caller  to  what  was \ndocumented in the associated NJ SPIRT Screening Summary.   On-site data collection took place \nJanuary 28-February 4, 2008.   A copy of this structured instrument is in Appendix B. \n \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nThe Study Team trained for the review by discussing each question and its meaning and listening \nto parts or all of several taped calls. In particular, the Study Team spent time reviewing the \ndimensions to be used to assess Screener professionalism. Through this process, behavioral \ncriteria for each rating were thoroughly discussed among Study Team members. This helped \nensure consistency of interpretation among the Study Team. \n \nAll  completed  data  collection  instruments  were  reviewed  for  completeness  and  internal \nconsistency prior to data entry and analysis.  Ten percent of the completed instruments received a \nsecond  review  by  the  Monitor  to  ensure  consistency  and  inter-rater  reliability  among  the \nreviewers.   Reviewers also often consulted with one-another about the circumstances of a call \nand sought clarification from SCR leadership when questions arose. \n \nAdditionally for all instruments in which a Study Team member disagreed with the original the \nSCR determination, a second, and in some cases a third, independent review was completed by \nthe Monitor’s staff.  \n \n4.  Data Analysis \n \nThe data collection instruments were keyed into a format that allowed electronic analysis using \nboth Excel and SPSS42.  These tools allowed the Study Review Team to generate frequencies of \nanswers for pertinent questions.  Team comments were also captured and reviewed to gain \ngreater understanding of the circumstances. \n \nB.  Focus Groups \n \nFive focus groups were held with the assistance of SCR leadership.  These focus groups were \ndesigned to elicit general themes about the SCR operations and polices.  A standard set of topics \nand questions were created for the focus groups. These questions are in the back of Appendix B, \nfollowing the Call review instrument. The focus groups had different compositions, two groups \nconsisted of Supervisors, two other groups were mostly certified Screeners, and one group was \nconducted with all uncertified Screeners.  \n \nC.  Review of Peer-Review and Supervisor Consultation \n \nStudy team members observed the daily peer review of calls that had been screened-out the \nprevious day. During these peer-reviews, the unit on duty for the week reviews the NJ SPIRIT \nScreening Summaries for calls which were classified as No Action Required (NAR) to confirm \nor revise the original Screener’s decision.  \n \n                                                 \n42 SPSS was formerly known as the Statistical Package for Social Science \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page A-2 \n\n \nStudy Review Team members also spent some time on “the call floor” observing SCR activity in \ngeneral and, more specifically, Screener consultation with call floor supervisors.    \n \nD.  Review of Policies, Procedures and Staffing \n \nDCF updated its policies and procedures for the SCR in 2007. The new policies are part of the \nbroad effort to revise many of the State’s policies to implement overall reforms. Study Team \nmembers reviewed the SCR policies, organization charts, staff credentials, position descriptions, \nstaffing schedules, NJ SPIRIT screens and training materials.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe New Jersey State Central Registry:  An Assessment  July 30, 2008 \nCenter for the Study of Social Policy    Page A-3 \n\n   \n \n \nAppendix B-1:  SCR Call Review Data Collection Instrument \n \nObserver Name:          Observation ID:_______________________ \n \n2008 Assessment of the Department of Child and Family Services  \nState Central Registry (SCR)   \n \nHotline Review Tool \n \nConducted by the Center for the Study of Social Policy (court-appointed Monitor for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed in July 2006 by the Honorable \nStanley R. Chesler of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey as Federal \nMonitor of the class action lawsuit Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie. As Monitor, CSSP is \ncharged with independently assessing New Jersey’s compliance with the goals, principles and \noutcomes of the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) 1 aimed at improving the state’s child \nwelfare system.2 \n \nThis report is the 15th monitoring report under the MSA and includes performance data for the \nperiod January 1 through June 30, 2014.  \n \nMethodology \n \nThe primary source of information on New Jersey’s progress are the extensive aggregate and \nback-up data supplied by the DCF and verified by the Monitor.  DCF also provides access to \nstaff at all levels to enable the Monitor to verify activities and performance.  For this report, the \nMonitor was involved in the following additional activities: \n \n  Caseload Data Verification \n \nThe Monitor conducted a telephone survey of 128 workers to verify their individual \ncaseloads during this monitoring period. Findings from this survey are discussed in \nSection XIII—Supporting a High Quality Workforce—of this report. \n \n  Investigations Review \nIn September 2014, the Monitor collaborated with DCF to review a statistically valid \nsample of 313 Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations involving 477 alleged child \nvictims assigned to DCF Local Offices between February 1 and 14, 2014 to assess the \noverall quality of investigative practice.  Findings and key recommendations are \ndiscussed in Section IV—DCF’s Investigative Practice – of this report.  \n \n  Housing, Employment and Education Status Review for Older Youth Exiting Care \n \nIn August 2014, the Monitor collaborated with DCF to review case records of 73 youth \nages 18 to 21 years who exited care between January and June 2014 without achieving \npermanency. The review focused on the education, housing and employment status of \nthese youth to determine if performance met the level required by the MSA. Findings \nfrom the review are discussed in Section XII—Services to Older Youth—of this report.   \n   \n                                                 \n1 Copies of all previous Monitoring Reports can be found at www.cssp.org. \n2 To see the full Agreement, go to \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/documents/home/Modified_Settlement_Agreement_7_17_06.pdf . \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 1 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 12 of 201 PageID: 7546\n \n \n  Family Team Meeting Data Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed 37 cases from February 2014 to verify that workers were properly \nusing and documenting legitimate reasons why the required FTMs did not occur. Further \ndiscussion of current performance is included in Section V – Implementing the Case \nPractice Model – of this report.  \n \n  Visitation Data Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed a small sample of 25 case records from February 2014 of children \nnewly in placement to verify that the children had the requisite two visits from their \ncaseworker during the first two months of the initial or subsequent out-of-home \nplacement. The purpose of the review was to compare data from the case records with \nadministrative data on visits produced by NJ SPIRIT (the CP&P data management \nsystem). The findings from CSSP’s manual audit of these cases was comparable to the \nperformance reported by SafeMeasures version 5 (v5). The Monitor has concluded that \nreporting on the visitation measures can occur using aggregate data from NJ SPIRIT.  \nFurther discussion of current performance is included in Section V—Implementing the \nCase Practice Model—of this report.   \n \n  Other Monitoring Activities \n \nThe Monitor interviewed and/or visited multiple external stakeholders of New Jersey’s \nchild welfare system, including contracted service providers, youth, relatives, birth \nparents, advocacy organizations and judicial officers. The Monitor also periodically \nattends DCF’s ChildStat meetings, statewide Child Fatality/Near Fatality Review Board \nmeetings, adolescent practice forums, Area Director meetings, youth permanency \nmeetings, and participates in statewide Qualitative Reviews. DCF has fully cooperated \nwith the Monitor in notifying them and facilitating their participation in relevant \nactivities.  \n \nStructure of the Report \n \nSection II of the report provides an overview of the state’s accomplishments and challenges. \nSection III provides summary performance data on each of the outcomes and performance \nmeasures required by the MSA in Table 1, Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie Child and Family \nOutcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Summary of Performance as of June 30, \n2014).  \n \nThe remaining sections of the report provide more detailed data and discussion of performance in \nthe following areas:  \n \n  Child protective services activities; including receiving reports and investigating \nallegations of alleged child maltreatment (Section IV); \n  Implementation of DCF’s Case Practice Model (Section V); \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the state has maintained good performance in many areas of the \nModified Settlement Agreement (MSA) and improved in some essential measures of case \npractice.  There are other practice measures, as discussed below, where performance did not \nshow significant change this period despite the state’s efforts to implement improvement \nstrategies and track results.   \n \nThe MSA is structured in two phases. The first phase, focused on building infrastructure and \nstandardizing caseloads while Phase II focuses on quality case practice and outcome measures.  \nThe thrust of current monitoring is on Phase II continued with close monitoring of caseload \nstandards and needs assessment measures from Phase I.  DCF has fully met 29 of the 34 Phase I \nmeasures and partially met three measures. \n \nPhase II of the MSA requires the state to meet 53 performance measures, 4 10 measures require \nthat performance be assessed annually using calendar year data and thus the 2014 performance \non those measures will be included in the next monitoring report.5 (Based on the data from 2012 \nand 2013 calendar years, the State had met two of these and partially met a third measure).  Of \nthe 43 performance measures assessed this monitoring period, as of June 30, 2014, 19 have been \nmet and 8 were partially met.6 In total, DCF has now met 21 of the 53 Phase II MSA \nperformance measures and partially met an additional ten measures. Importantly, DCF has also \nbeen able to maintain performance for nearly all previously met performance measures. 7   \n \nOne performance measure was newly met during this monitoring period: \n \n  Risk Reassessment Within 30 Days of Case Closure in Non-investigative Cases \n(Performance Measure 8c) which requires that in order to ensure safe case closure \nworkers reassess the risk to a child(ren) prior to ending a case.  \n \nAlso noteworthy during this monitoring period is the improvement in performance for visitation \nand adoption measures.  While the MSA performance levels have not yet been met, DCF’s \nimprovement strategies are having a positive effect in these areas.  For example:  \n \n                                                 \n4 Monitoring reports prior to Period XIII referenced 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures.  \n5 These measures include placing of sibling groups together (Measures 25and 26 - MSA III.A.3.b.), stability of \nplacement (Measure 27 -MSA III.A.3.a.), abuse and neglect of children in foster care - met (Measure 30  - MSA \nIII.A.1.a.), repeat maltreatment (Measures 31 and 32- MSA III.A.1.b&c.), re-entry to placement (Measure 33- MSA \nIII.A.2.b.) and discharge from foster care to permanency- partially met (Measure 34a,d,e t) including specific targets \nfor adoption - met (Measure 34(b) - MSA III.A.2.a.). \n6 “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close but has not substantially met the requirement, for example \nmeeting the requirement in the final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has \ntwo or more sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all. See \nfootnote 10 for a more detailed explanation of terms used in this report regarding compliance levels. Performance is \nbased upon the most recent available data through June 30, 2014. \n7 Timeliness of initial case plans (Measure 10) and Independent Living Assessments (Measure 53) declined from \n‘yes’ to ‘partially.’  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 16 of 201 PageID: 7550\n \n  Caseworker visits to children within the first two months of an initial or subsequent \nplacement has improved this period and now partially meets the required level of \nperformance.  These visits are important to support safety, service delivery and placement \nstability and CP&P has shown substantial progress in this area since we have been \ntracking visits as part of the MSA.  In December 2009, performance was 18 percent and \nby June 2014, 92 percent of applicable children had the required number of visits by their \ncaseworker in the first two months after an initial placement or replacement in a new \nresource home.  \n \n  Performance for visits between children and their parents when the permanency goal is \nreunification is also partially met this monitoring period.  Due to new capabilities of \nSafeMeasures v5, DCF is now able to more precisely report on completion of weekly \nvisits between parents and their children and data indicate that in June 2014, 68 percent \nof children had weekly visits with their parents, exceeding the final MSA target of 60 \npercent for that month.  Performance on visits at least every other week was also \nimproved.  Since 2009, there has been pronounced improvement on documented visits \nbetween children in foster care and their parents, an activity that is supported by research \nevidence as important to safe family reunification. Specifically, in December 2009, 11 \npercent of children that month had at least two visits with their parent.  By June 2014, \nperformance was 83 percent.  \n \n  Improvements are also noted in completion of child specific adoption recruitment plans \nfor children within 30 days of a goal change to adoption.  During the previous monitoring \nperiod, only 37 percent of the 147 plans required were completed within 30 days.  For \nthis period, 67 percent of the 78 required plans were completed within 30 days; although \nnot at the final target level of 90 percent, performance has moved significantly in the \nright direction.  \n \n  Improvements were also noted in placement of children with a permanency goal of \nadoption in an adoptive home within nine months of the termination of parental \nrights.  The final target requires this timeframe be met for 75 percent of applicable \nchildren and current performance for the 21 applicable children is now at 62 percent.  \n \nQualitative Review (QR) data for the first six months of CY2014 also indicate improved case \npractice. The overall safety and well-being of children and families were rated as acceptable in \n91 percent of cases reviewed, including a rating of 99 percent for safety in the home and 95 \npercent for physical health of the child reviewed. \n \nIn addition, the Monitor is encouraged by the first six months of QR data for 2014 which is also \nshowing improved system performance in some important measures including the quality of case \nand service planning and meeting the educational needs of children.  \n \nOther accomplishments this monitoring period include: \n \n  The commencement of child protective services investigations within the required \nresponse time for 98 percent of investigations; \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 17 of 201 PageID: 7551\n \n  Increased performance on the timely completion of child protective investigations ( 76% \nwere completed within 60 days in the first six months of 2014, up from 63 percent in the \nprevious nine month monitoring period); \n  Consistent quality performance on nearly all the MSA health care measures that assess \nwhether children in out-of-home placement have dependable access to health care; \n  Solid QR ratings on how children’s out-of-home placement meets their developmental, \nemotional, behavioral and physical needs; and \n  Expansion of DCF’s policies and practices to support adolescents, including older youth \ntransitioning out of care. \n \nThe monitoring report also identifies ongoing challenges and areas of practice where \nimprovements have been slower.  Of concern is the increase this period in both intake and \nadoption worker caseloads, which are now higher than acceptable.  Also there remains a \ncontinuing issue with quality ratings on team formation and functioning and providing services \n,\nto support transitions out of placement.  An area that DCF has targeted for more in-depth review \nand for improvement strategies is the high rate of repeat maltreatment of children and their \nfamily’s re-involvement with CP&P within one year of reunification. Assessing both statewide \nand local office data on this measure has prompted agency leaders and workers to reassess what \nadditional steps and services may be needed to reduce the rate of repeat child welfare \ninvolvement.  \n \nAlthough there remain important MSA outcomes still to be achieved, DCF has demonstrated that \nit is a system that is continually trying to improve itself, as evidenced in no small part by the \nopportunities it has successfully sought to leverage new federal dollars to strengthen its adoption \npractice and to support highly vulnerable sub-populations such as runaway and homeless youth. \nThe state leadership has emphasized and continues its work to further its capacity to effectively \ncollect and use quantitative and qualitative data to access practices and outcomes and adjust or \ndevelop new strategies as needed. \n \nDCF has made a number of new appointments and changes to DCF’s management structure \nduring this monitoring period.  In September 2014, DCF appointed Joseph Ribsam as Deputy \nCommissioner. A previous member of the DCF leadership team, Ribsam will continue to oversee \nlegislative, policy and regulatory work as well as be responsible for the Department’s legal and \npublic affairs, grants management, auditing and communications work. Charmaine Thomas was \nappointed Assistant Commissioner for Community Partnerships. Most recently the Division \nDirector of Family and Community Partnerships, she will oversee the Division on Women \n(DOW), which will now include the Office of Domestic Violence.  DCF also consolidated the \nMiddlesex Area Office and the Union Area Office into one office. Additionally, a high volume \nof recent retirements has provided the state with the opportunity for new staff to move into \nleadership positions as Area Directors and Local Office Managers.  \n \nThe remainder of this summary discusses the strengths and challenges of current performance in \nthe major substantive areas covered by the MSA.  The data on specific performance measures are \nprovided in Table 1 and the full report.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 7 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 18 of 201 PageID: 7552\n \nInvestigation of Alleged Abuse and Neglect  \n \nThe State Central Registry (SCR) continues to operate professionally, efficiently and effectively; \nreports of alleged abuse and neglect are appropriately screened and timely forwarded to the field \nfor investigation. Investigative staff are well trained.  In September 2014, the Monitor with DCF \nassessed the quality of investigative practice in a random sample of 313 CPS investigations \nassigned to DCF Local Offices between February 1 and 14, 2014. Seventy-eight percent of the \ninvestigations were rated as meeting quality standards.  The findings of the review reflect clear \nstrengths in practice around conducting safety and risk assessments, interviewing the mothers of \nalleged child victims and holding both pre and post-investigation caseworker supervisory \nconferences.  As noted in the report, investigations caseloads have risen beyond compliance \nlevels and the Monitor is concerned that unless intake caseloads are reduced, the workload will \nhave a deleterious impact on a worker’s ability to conduct a timely and quality investigation. \n \nImplementation of the Case Practice Model  \n \nDCF continued to focus on improving case practice performance and succeeded in significantly \nimproving performance on holding initial and quarterly Family Team Meetings (FTMs) during \nthis monitoring period.  The state’s strategy of holding bi-weekly conferences among DCF \nleadership, Area Directors and their Local Office managers to review individual performance on \nspecific key indicators has shown results, particularly in improvement in FTM documentation \nand performance and worker visits to children during the first two months of initial or \nsubsequent placement. Current data also demonstrate that DCF is performing better on worker \nvisits with parents when the permanency goal is reunification, while DCF is also continuing to \nassess its data collection and analysis methods in an attempt to accelerate documented \nimprovements in this area.  \n \nNotably, the QR overall ratings for January through June of 2014 for practice and system \nperformance, one indicator of the quality of case practice statewide, show improvement.  \nHowever, certain key QR ratings such as engagement with parents and family teamwork remain \nbelow levels expected by both DCF leadership and the MSA and more work is needed to raise \nratings to anticipated levels and fully realize the principles of New Jersey’s Case Practice Model.  \n \nPlacement of Children in Out-of-Home Care \n \nDCF’s current performance on MSA requirements regarding the appropriate placement of \nchildren in the state’s custody meets many of the MSA targets. Importantly, 96 percent of cases \nexamined through the QR were judged to be acceptable on the appropriateness of a child’s \nplacement.  DCF continued to meet standards on the placement of children in a family-like \nsetting and within placement capacity limits. Sixty-six percent of newly licensed families are \nrelatives of children in care, illustrating sustained improvement in this area.  \n \nTimely Permanency through Reunification, Adoption or Legal Guardianship \n \nDCF continues to exceed the MSA target to finalize adoptions within nine months of an adoptive \nplacement. DCF has also shown improvement since the previous monitoring period in \ncompletion of child specific recruitment plans for applicable children within 30 days of goal \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 8 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 19 of 201 PageID: 7553\n \nchange and in placement of children in an adoptive home within nine months of termination of \nparental rights, although performance still does not meet the required MSA targets.  \n \nHealth and Mental Health Care for Children in Out-of-Home Placement \n \nAs the Monitor has reported consistently over the past three years, DCF’s work through its Child \nHealth Units and with its nurses and health and mental health providers has meant that \nperformance on the MSA’s health and mental health indicators remains strong and that children \nand youth in out-of-home placement have timely access to healthcare services.  The one \ncontinued challenge is ensuring that resource parents receive a child’s health passport within five \ndays of placement. Performance on this measure is 62 percent, well below the final target of 95 \npercent.   However, in 98 percent of cases, the health passport was provided to resource parents \nwithin 30 days of a child entering out-of-home care. \n \nServices to Prevent Entry into Foster Care and To Support Reunification and Permanency  \n \nOver the past six years, DCF has successfully expanded its use of Family Success Centers \n(FSCs), one of its core strategies to support children in their families and communities. FSCs are \nneighborhood-based centers where families can access services when needed and before falling \ninto crisis.  There are currently 52 FSCs statewide, and they continue to be a significant system \nstrength for children, youth and families in New Jersey.  DCF’s Office of Family Support \nServices (OFSS) has provided additional funding to some FSCs in the areas of highest need \n(many of which suffered the effects from Superstorm Sandy) to offer psychosocial and family \nstrengthening events and community building activities.  DCF is also continuing to strengthen its \nwork in the area of domestic violence prevention and treatment.    \n \nServices to Older Youth  \n \nDCF continues to allocate significant energy and resources towards improving the provision of \nservices and supports to adolescents, including those for older youth transitioning out of care. \nThe state has revised policies and practices to support and improve well-being and permanency \noutcomes for these youth. DCF continues to contract for 390 transitional and supportive housing \nslots statewide for youth seeking housing, aging out of care or who are homeless. Further, new \nprograms and improvements to existing educational strategies have been developed to enhance \nacademic performance, attainment and accessibility.   \n \nDespite consistent efforts to improve services for older youth, performance on one MSA measure \npertaining to older youth has declined slightly and for two other measures, no improvements \nwere found this monitoring period. The percentage of youth between the ages of 14 and 18 who \ncompleted Independent Living Assessments dropped slightly below the MSA target of 95 \npercent this monitoring period. Also data for the first six months of 2014 determined that 70 \npercent of older youth cases reviewed using the QR protocol were rated acceptable on services to \nolder youth, below the MSA target of 90 percent. Moderate declines in performance for required \nservices and supports to youth exiting care without achieving permanency were noted as well: \nalthough current data are only available for January through June 2014, the number of youth \nexiting care with a plan for housing fell compared to data for CY2013, and the number of youth \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Its weekly reviews of \nperformance with Local Office management are noteworthy, as are its regular QRs which \nprovide county-level data on the state’s progress in implementing the Case Practice Model. As \nfurther detailed in the report, DCF’s monthly ChildStat meetings model for staff the importance \nof the increased use of quantitative and qualitative data to better understand and improve system \nperformance and outcomes.  \n \nThe Monitor continues to support DCF’s development of its quality assurance and accountability \nprocesses and believes its quality improvement efforts have already demonstrated significant \nimprovement in the quality of care for children, youth and families in New Jersey. \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CHILD AND FAMILY OUTCOME AND CASE PRACTICE PERFORMANCE \nMEASURES \n \nThe Child and Family Outcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Performance \nMeasures) are 53 measures that assess the state’s performance on meeting the requirements of \nthe MSA (see Table 1).8  These performance measures cover the areas of child safety, \npermanency, service planning, child well-being and ongoing infrastructure requirements \npertaining to elements such as caseloads, training and resource family recruitment and retention.  \n \nMany of the measures are assessed using data from NJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures,9 reviewed and \nin many areas independently validated by the Monitor. Some data are also provided through the \nDepartment’s work with Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc. that assists with data analysis. Data \nprovided in the report are as of June 2014, or the most current data available. \n                                                 \n8 The previous monitoring report references 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures.  \n9 SafeMeasures is a data warehouse and analytical tool that allows tracking of critical child welfare indicators by \nworker, supervisor, Local Office area and statewide. It is used by different levels of staff to track, monitor and \nanalyze trends in case practice and targeted measures and outcomes.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

In other instances, the \nMonitor provides a range of data over the monitoring period to better illustrate performance.  More detailed information on DCF performance on specific measures is provided in \nsubsequent sections of the report. \n11 “Yes” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on presently available information, DCF has substantially fulfilled its obligations regarding the requirement under the \nMSA for the majority of the months during January 1 through June 30, 2014 monitoring period. The Monitor has also designated “Yes” for a requirement where DCF is within one \npercentage point of the final target or there are a small number (less than 3) of cases causing the failure to meet the final target. “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close \nbut has not substantially met the requirement, for example meeting the requirement in final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has two or \nmore sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all.  “No” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, DCF has not fulfilled its \nobligation regarding the requirement.  \n12 Where applicable, “” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on data and an understanding of case practice, performance is trending upwards by at least three \npercentage points; “” indicates performance is trending downward by at least three percentage points; “↔” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, there has been no change in \nperformance; “N/A” indicates a judgment regarding direction of change from the previous monitoring period to the current monitoring period cannot be made. The Monitor is \ncomparing performance to the previous monitoring period and has taken into consideration that the previous monitoring period was nine months long (April –December 2013) \nwhile the current one is six months long. \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families                January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The parties agreed that, consistent with \nthe previous monitoring period, while the state is involved in this self-diagnosis and corrective action, the Monitor will continue to assess performance on FTMs by counting only \nthose FTMs that actually occurred. The report’s documented progress therefore includes the number of FTMs that have actually occurred.

Current performance is reported by the average percentage of children who had visits with their parent each week during the month.  This is different than previous periods \nwhen performance was based upon the percentage of children who had four visits during the month with their parent.

New Jersey’s State Central Registry (SCR) \n \nNew Jersey’s State Central Registry (SCR) is charged with receiving calls of suspected child \nabuse and neglect and calls where reporters believe the well-being of families is at risk and an \nassessment, support, and/or information and referral is needed, even though there is no allegation \nof child abuse or neglect. The SCR operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week with multiple \nshifts of staff and supervisors and a sophisticated call management and recording system. \nScreeners at SCR determine the nature of each caller’s concerns and initiate the appropriate \nresponse. This function also includes receiving calls about and investigating allegations of abuse \nand/or neglect in institutional settings (e.g., resource homes, schools and residential facilities).  \nCP&P Local Offices employ investigative staff to follow up on the calls as appropriate. A \nregionally organized Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) is responsible for follow-up \nto investigate allegations of abuse and/or neglect in institutional settings.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Of all the calls received during this monitoring period, 30,312 (35%) calls related to the \npossible need for Child Protective Services (CPS) responses. Of those, screeners classified \n29,718 (98%) reports for investigation of alleged child abuse or neglect. Another 8,912 (10%) \ncalls related to the possible need for Child Welfare Services (CWS) and an assessment of service \nneeds, of which 8,616 (97%) were referred for response. The call, CPS report and CWS \nassessment volumes are similar to those of the same time period in 2013.

Decision-making process based on information gathered and guided by \ntools and supervision \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \n \nPerformance as of June 30, 2014: \n \nBetween January and June 2014, the SCR continued to conduct staff training and quality \nassurance which the Monitor believes has contributed to the overall quality of SCR response. \nSCR enhanced the internal training of newly hired staff by requiring skilled SCR screeners to \ncomplete training status notes on trainee performance related to timeliness of response, \ninformation collection, documentation and decision-making. This process assists with assessing \nthe newly hired staff’s areas of strength and improvement, enabling the training to be tailored to \nthe new hire’s individual skill level.  DCF employees who transfer to SCR continue to receive up \nto 20 days of training with an emphasis on live-call training.78 Newly hired SCR staff spend the \nfinal week of their training period on the designated shift they are assigned. This process permits \nthe supervisor to become an active participant in the screener’s training process.  \n \nDCF continues to focus efforts on leadership training to increase SCR supervisors’ capacity to \naddress complex situations, measure results and assist in the implementation of sustained system \nchange to better support screeners and improve decision-making. In June 2014, three SCR \nscreeners successfully graduated from the DCF/Rutgers School of Social Work’s Violence \nAgainst Women Program. This program is part of DCF’s efforts to increase screeners’ \nknowledge about violence and its impact on children and families.  \n \nQuality assurance remains a priority for the SCR. As previously reported, a Quality Assurance \nPeer Review Team completes a daily review of all reports designated as information and referral \n(I&R)79 generated the previous business day. SCR staff evaluate 75 percent of all I&R calls \nreceived the previous business day to ensure they are properly categorized. Supervisory staff \nmore closely examine the remaining 25 percent of I&R calls for proper decision making and case \npractice. To account for internal bias, reports identified with concerns are reviewed by casework \nsupervisors who were not included in the referral’s decision-making process. The SCR \nadministrator also performs a daily review of randomly selected reports. SCR supervisors also \nreview and evaluate a prescribed number of calls of their staff in order to continually assess the \nscreeners' performance, identify areas in need of improvement and provide on-going training to \n                                                 \n78 All employees at SCR must have prior field experience. \n79 A call is identified as I&R when it has been determined that CP&P intervention is not warranted, and (1) a caller \nis seeking a referral to one or more service providers, (2) a SCR screener determines that a referral is the appropriate \nresponse to the concern raised by the caller or (3) the matter is referred back to the caller for handling (e.g., police \ncalling about non-abuse incident, school calling about educational neglect). \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

During this monitoring period, SCR’s administrative team analyzed trends \nrelated to requests where the intake call was originally coded as I&R, but upon administrative \nreview, was determined that CP&P intervention was warranted, upgrading the call to either a \nCWS or CPS.  The result of this review revealed a need to refocus on and enhance screener \npractices for referrals related to child-on-child sexual activity, requests for services from youth \nages 18 to 21 and requests from out-of-state CPS agencies. A system was put in place requiring \neach screener to conference these types of referrals with a supervisor prior to coding the call. \nAdditionally, SCR instituted case practice forums with supervisory staff to further discuss and \nstrengthen practice for these specific case situations.   \nWork also continued on updating the call management system to allow screeners access to their \nown calls at their desktop via email, enabling them to listen to the call as many times as they \nneed as they write their report and to facilitate supervision. This upgrade allows supervisors to \nimmediately evaluate screeners’ work and supports prompt supervisory feedback to screeners on \ntheir performance.  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This \nlevel of performance meets the MSA standards. \n \nCP&P policy on timeliness of investigations requires receipt by the field of a report within one \nhour of call completion.80  During the month of June 2014, DCF received 4,661 referrals of child \nabuse and neglect requiring investigation. Of the 4,661 referrals, 4,335 (93%) referrals were \nreceived by the field in less than an hour of call completion. An additional 301 (6%) referrals \nwere received by the field between one and three hours after call completion; for a total of 99 \npercent of referrals received by the field within three hours of call completion.  The number of \nreferrals received per month ranged from 4,359 in February 2014 to 5,345 in May 2014.   \n \nCP&P policy considers an investigation “commenced” when at least one of the alleged victim \nchildren has been seen by an investigator.  During the month of June 2014, there were 4,474 CPS \nintakes applicable to this measure.81  Of the 4,474 intakes received, 1,216 intakes were coded for \nan immediate response and 3,258 intakes were coded for a response within 24 hours; 4,385 \n(98%) intakes were commenced within their required response time.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n80 The Monitor currently assesses performance of receipt by the field in a timely manner with a three hour standard.  \n81 Intakes are differentiated from referrals because SCR can receive several referrals related to one incident or in \nother instances, one referral can result in several intakes. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Although at its \nhighest performance level since measurement began in 2009, performance on completions of \ninvestigations within 60 days does not meet the final target.  \n \nA case record review of the quality of CP&P’s investigative practice was conducted in \nSeptember 2014.  This review examined the quality of practice in 313 CPS investigations \ninvolving 477 alleged child victims assigned to DCF Local Offices between February 1 and \nFebruary 14, 2014. 82 \n                                                 \n82 These results have a ± 5% margin of error with 95% confidence.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Key strengths include:  \n \n  Safety and risk assessments were completed in 100 percent of the investigations, \n  Caseworkers interviewed the mother of the alleged child victim in 97 percent of the \ninvestigations and \n  Pre and post-investigation worker/supervisor conference took place in 97 percent of the \ninvestigations. \n \nOverall, recommendations for improvement include clarification through policy, training and \ncoaching of staff and supervisors on some areas of investigative practice and improvement in \ndocumentation of investigative activities and events. The areas for improvement of investigative \npractice found in the review include: \n \n  Reviewing and integrating a family’s prior child protection history through interviews \nwith other CP&P workers as well as other protective authorities.  This was of particular \nsignificance since the family had prior CP&P history in 66 percent of the investigations \nreviewed.  \n  Securing and integrating significant collateral information into investigative decision-\nmaking. Reviewers determined that all applicable collateral information was obtained in \n53 percent of investigations. \n  Interviewing the fathers of alleged child victims during investigations. Reviewers found \nthat 65 percent of fathers where contact information was available were interviewed. \n \n   \n                                                 \n83 Reviewers could select four possible responses to the question of the quality of the investigation which included \ncompletely, substantially, marginally and not at all. Completely and substantially responses are considered as having \nmet quality standards. The results have a +/- 5% marginal error with 95% confidence. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Between 79 and 87 percent of all \nIAIU investigations were open less than 60 days (see Table 2) during the months of January \nthrough June 2014.  \n \nThe MSA does not make any distinction on the type of investigations IAIU conducts based on \nthe allegation or location of the alleged abuse and the 60 day completion standard applies to all \nIAIU investigations. In reviewing IAIU performance, the Monitor requests data separately on \ninvestigations of maltreatment in foster care settings (resource family homes and congregate care \nfacilities) as well as from other settings (e.g., schools, day care).  Table 2 displays IAIU’s \nreported overall investigative timeliness performance for the dates cited and specific \nperformance for resource family homes and congregate care facilities.

IAIU Investigations Corrective Action Monitoring  \n \nEvery IAIU investigation results in a “finding” letter which is sent to a facility or resource home.  \nThis letter cites the investigative conclusion and, if applicable, identifies concerns and requests \ncorrective action. Finding letters pertaining to resource homes, congregate care facilities, \nlicensed child care centers and unregistered child care are all sent to DCF’s Office of Licensing \n(OOL).When a request for corrective action is made, DCF policy requires the facility \nadministrator or the resource home unit responsible for supervising the resource home to develop \nand submit a corrective action plan (CAP) within 30 calendar days of the date on the IAIU \nfinding letter.85  IAIU’s Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) staff are responsible for \nmonitoring the development and implementation of CAPs to assure satisfactory resolution of all \nconcerns identified in the finding letter. CQI staff are also responsible for determining whether \nthe CAP is successfully completed and whether it is approved, disapproved or will remain open \nand pending. All CAPs require the submission of supporting documentation to confirm the plan \nwas implemented and completed. As a result, CAPs remain open until all documentation is \nreceived.  DCF policy does not stipulate time frames for when CQI staff must approve \nsuccessfully completed CAPs. Time frames for the successful completion of CAPs vary \naccording to the elements of the plan. For example, a CAP may include intensive monitoring of a \nresource home for a six month period. In that instance, IAIU’s CQI staff will review \ndocumentation of the six month monitoring to determine whether the identified concerns have \nbeen addressed and, if they are addressed, will approve the CAP as successfully completed.  \n \nBetween January and June 2014, IAIU issued 265 CAP requests involving resource family \nhomes, group homes and residential facilities where children were placed.  Information reported \nfrom the IAIU corrective action database indicate that 192 (72%) of 265 CAPs had been \napproved as successfully completed and 73 (28%) corrective action requests were outstanding or \npending resolution as of June 30, 2014.  \n \nReview of Corrective Action Plans  \n \nThe Monitor reviewed 10 randomly selected CAP requests that resulted from investigation \nfindings between January and June 2014 to look at feedback processes between IAIU and other \ndivisions (e.g. OOL) and to ensure CAPs are being developed and implemented.  The sample \nincluded four resource family homes, two kinship resource homes, one group home, one \ncontracted shelter and two residential facilities. CAPs were developed and submitted to the IAIU \nCQI unit for eight of the 10 requests86; seven of the eight were developed and submitted within \n30 days from the date of the finding letter.  IAIU’s CQI staff accepted all eight CAPs as \nsuccessfully implemented. CAPs from this sample included the following corrective actions: \nmonitoring of resource homes, closing of a resource home, training and re-training of resource \nparents and facility staff on CP&P policies and procedures.  \n \n                                                 \n85 CP&P Policy Manual (4-1-2013). IAIU Remedial Action, Corrective Action and Monitoring, I, A, 700.  \n86 For the two CAPS in the sample that had not been developed and submitted as of June 30, 2014, there was \nevidence of follow-up and subsequent requests by IAIU CQI staff for their development.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 56 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 332   Filed 01/23/15   Page 67 of 201 PageID: 7601\n \n \nAdditionally, the Monitor reviewed five randomly selected CAP requests resulting from \ninvestigation finding letters dated between January and June 2014 which were pending approval \nas successfully completed by IAIU CQI staff 90 days and after the date of the findings letter.  \nThe CAPs pending approval were reviewed to determine the reasons why they remained pending \nand if IAIU staff were following up appropriately on the identified concerns. The sample \nincluded three resource family homes, one residential facility and one group home.  CAPs were \ndeveloped and submitted for two of the five requests. IAIU’s CQI staff did not accept either of \nthe two CAPs as of June 30, 2014 for varying reasons, indicating that the CAP did not \ncomprehensively address all concerns identified and documentation was missing to verify that a \nstaff member was no longer employed with the agency and that a resource home was closed. For \nthe three CAPs in the sample that had not been developed and submitted as of June 30, 2014, \nthere was evidence that IAIU staff had sent letters and emails to supervisors of resource home \nunits and a group home to follow up on the requests for a CAP.    \n \nThe CAPs reviewed appeared to adequately address the incidents which prompted the IAIU \ninvestigation. There was evidence of appropriate communication between divisions in all cases \nreviewed, particularly between IAIU and OOL regarding the licensure of resource homes and \nfacilities under investigation. In addition, IAIU hosts monthly “systems partners” meetings with \nOOL and SCR to ensure that concerns identified during IAIU investigations are communicated \nto all system partners. The Monitor will observe at some of these meetings during the next \nmonitoring period.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

IMPLEMENTING THE CASE PRACTICE MODEL \n \nDCF continues to train on and reinforce high quality case practice according to New Jersey’s \nCase Practice Model (CPM). The CPM is designed to guide and support staff towards a strength-\nbased and family-centered approach that ensures the safety, permanency and well-being of \nchildren. This practice requires engagement with children, youth and families through teamwork \nand crafting individualized case plans with families and children.  \n \nDuring this period, DCF continued its practice of holding weekly conference calls among DCF \nleadership, Area Directors and their Local Office managers to review individual performance on \nspecific key indicators, including visitation, Family Team Meetings (FTMs) and case plan \ndevelopment. These weekly calls encourage more consistent use of quantitative and qualitative \ndata to support positive outcomes for children and families. \n \nThe performance measures discussed below measure progress on some of the CPM activities \nusing data from NJ SPIRIT and data collected during the state’s Qualitative Review (QR) \nprocess, a case review process led by DCF’s Office of Quality discussed in more detail in \nSection XIV.   \n \nA.  Activities Supporting the Implementation of the Case Practice Model \n \nA critical component of CP&P’s CPM is its focus on coaching, facilitating and supervising \nFTMs, where families and their formal and informal supports meet to discuss the families’ \nstrengths and needs and progress toward accomplishing their case plan.  CP&P continues to \nbuild its capacity to hold FTMs, primarily through its Implementation Specialists. CP&P has ten \nImplementation Specialists, one in each area. Their primary responsibility is to provide ongoing \nassistance to staff on FTMs and on the CPM.  Implementation Specialists train and mentor staff \nto serve as facilitators, coaches and master coaches who conduct FTMs and implement the \nCPM.87  They also conduct training at Local Offices tailored to staff needs, particularly on topics \nrelated to effective engagement of families and building appropriate and functioning teams that \nsupport families.  \n \nAs of June 30, 2014, DCF had developed 2,315 staff as FTM facilitators, 328 as coaches and 164 \nas master coaches. Table 3 shows the number of facilitators, coaches and master coaches by \nCP&P area.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n87 Facilitators are trained to conduct Family Team Meetings according to protocol and the principles and values of \nDCF’s CPM. Coaches are CP&P staff of varying levels who are trained specifically to lead FTMs; master coaches \ntrain Local Office and Area staff to become facilitators and coaches.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

At the ChildStat meetings, Local Office leadership \npresent practice issues, including data on key performance indicators from the most recent two \nfiscal quarters compared with statewide data. As additional offices participate in ChildStat, more \nstaff from many levels within DCF have become better able to use data to assess Local Office \nperformance.  During each ChildStat, the Local Offices also present the history and current \nprogress on a case selected for review by the Office of Quality.  During this monitoring period, \n                                                 \n88 Drawn from CompStat in New York City, ChildStat is a process wherein organizations use quantitative and \nqualitative data from multiple contexts to understand and attempt to improve service delivery.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

A revised ChildStat format \nfeatures a focus on the quality of case practice with families where the children remain in the \nhome, the assessment and case planning skill of workers, as well as the extent of collaboration \nwith formal and informal resources available to support families. The Monitor continues to \nregularly attend DCF’s ChildStat meetings as an observer and is impressed with the leadership \nattention to and the high quality of the ChildStat process.  \n \nConcurrent Planning Practice \n \nDCF workers hold case reviews at five and 10 months into a child’s placement for staff to \naddress concurrent planning, a practice commonly used throughout the country in which workers \nengage with families with children in out-of-home placement to reunify children as quickly as \npossible while simultaneously pursuing alternative permanency options should reunification \nefforts fail.  Staff also conduct “enhanced reviews” after a child has been in placement for five \nand 10 months to carry out its concurrent planning as required by the MSA. Enhanced reviews \noccur in all CP&P Local Offices. \n \nStatewide, in June 2014, 91 percent of applicable families had the required five month \nreviews, and 90 percent had the required 10 month reviews. \n \nAs Table 4 reflects, in June 2014, 91 percent of five month reviews due that month were \ncompleted timely statewide.  Between January and June 2014, monthly performance on this \nmeasure ranged from 91 to 98 percent. \n  \nTable 4:  Five Month Enhanced Review \n(January – June 2014) \n \nJANUARY  FEBRUARY  MARCH  APRIL  MAY  JUNE \n \n#  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  % \nReviews \nCompleted  301   98%    333  97%  308   95%  271     97%   235    95%  308     91%   \nw/in Five \nMonths \nReviews Not \nCompleted  7    2%  10  3%  15     5%  7      3%    12      5%   32     9% \nw/in Five \nMonths \nTotals  308  100%  343  100%  323  100%  278  100%  247  100%  340  100% \nSource:  DCF data \n \n \nTable 5 shows that statewide in June 2014, 90 percent of 10 month reviews due that month were \ncompleted timely.

Family Team Meetings and Case Planning \n \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) are intended to work in concert with individualized case \nplanning to support improved results for children and families. Workers are trained and coached \nto hold FTMs at key decision points in the life of a case, such as when a child enters placement, \nwhen a child has a change of placement and/or when there is a need to adjust a case plan.  \nWorking at optimal capacity, FTMs enable families, providers, formal and informal supports to \nexchange information that can be critical to coordinating and following up on services, \nexamining and solving problems and achieving positive outcomes.  Meetings are to be scheduled \naccording to the family’s availability in an effort to get as many family members and family \nsupports as possible around the table. Engaging the family, the core of New Jersey’s CPM, is a \ncritical component of successful family teaming.  \n \nFamily Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings \n \n \n7.  Family Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings:   A family \nteam (involving parents, youth and appropriate formal and informal supports) \nshall meet and plan together. The team should be involved in planning & \ndecision-making throughout a case and have the skills, family knowledge and \nabilities to solve and help to organize effective services for the child and family.  \nQuantitative or \nNumber of family team meetings at key decision points: \nQualitative Measure   \na.  For children newly entering placement, the number/percent who have a \nfamily team meeting within 30 days of entry. \nb.  For all other children in placement, the number/percent who have at least \none family team meeting each quarter. \nc.  Family Teamwork\n \na.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held prior to or within 30 days of entry \nfor 90% of new entries and 90% of pre-placements. \nb.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held for 90% of children at least once \nFinal Target \nper quarter. \nc.  By June 30, 2011, 90% of cases show evidence in QR of acceptable team \nformation and functioning. \n \n \nPerformance as of June 30, 2014: \n \nInitial FTMs \n \nDCF performance on holding initial FTMs is steadily improving although DCF has not yet met \ntargets requiring FTMs for 90 percent of children prior to or within 30 days of a child entering \nfoster care, for pre-placements, and at least once per quarter thereafter.   \n \nFor the past several monitoring periods, DCF leaders have worked with Area Directors, Local \nOffice managers and line staff to both improve worker engagement with parents, to encourage \nparticipation in FTMs, and to improve documentation and data entry to account for legitimate \nreasons why FTMs do not occur (either because the parent is unavailable or because the parent \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The parties agreed that due to data validation challenges, reported \ndocumented progress would include only the number of FTMs that have actually occurred. DCF \npreviously provided the Monitor with data intended to demonstrate its confidence that workers \nwere properly using and documenting legitimate reasons for why the required FTMs are not \noccurring.  In July 2014, the Monitor reviewed a random sample of cases and was not able to \nvalidate that workers were appropriately using the exceptions.89 By agreement, as soon as the \nstate determines that workers are properly using and documenting exceptions, the Monitor and \nDCF will conduct a statistically valid case record review and will report on the findings. \nConsequently, the report continues to show the progress that has been made in the number of \nFTMs actually held, recognizing that the data on these MSA measures understate performance \nbecause it does not yet reflect legitimate exceptions. \n \nAccording to NJ SPIRIT, and counting only those FTMs that actually occurred, in June 2014, out \nof 346 possible FTMs, 257 (74%) occurred within 30 days of a child’s removal; from January to \nJune 2014, monthly performance ranged from 68 to 80 percent. The state’s performance on \nFTMs that occurred has improved from the previous monitoring period, but does not yet meet the \nrequired level of 90 percent.

For example, in \nJune 2014, there were 4,761 applicable100 investigation cases closed; all 4,761 (100%) \ninvestigations had a safety assessment completed prior to investigation closure and all 4,761 \n(100%) investigations had a risk assessment completed prior to investigation completion. \n \nPerformance on conducting a risk reassessment 30 days prior to non-investigative case closure \nwas newly met this monitoring period (see Figure 14). In June 2014, there were 529 applicable101 \ncases closed. Of these 529 cases, 521 (98%) cases had a risk reassessment completed within 30 \ndays prior to case closure; the remaining eight (2%) cases had a risk reassessment completed \nwithin 31 to 60 days prior to case closure. This is an important accomplishment. \n                                                 \n99 In order to be consistent with practice expectations, in May 2012, the parties agreed to revise the final target from, \n“By December 31, 2010, 98% of cases will have a safety and risk of harm assessment completed prior to case \nclosure” to the language stated above, which allows for separate reporting on investigations and non-investigations \ncases.   \n100 In June 2014, an additional 15 investigations were closed; however, those cases were marked as “unable to make \ncontact with children/family” and were excluded from the calculations. \n101Applicable cases include reunification and do not include adoption, kinship legal guardianship or emancipation. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Performance Measures on Caseworker, Parent-Child and Sibling Visits \n \nThe visits of children in foster care with their workers, parents and siblings are integral to the \nprinciples of the CPM and are important events to ensure children’s safety, maintain and \nstrengthen family connections, and increase children’s opportunities to achieve permanency. \n \nDCF’s performance on visits this monitoring period showed important improvements. DCF \npartially met the requirement for monthly caseworker visits to children in out-of-home placement \nand improvements were demonstrated in visits between parents and caseworkers.  Additionally, \ndue to the new capabilities of SafeMeasures v5 which was implemented this monitoring period, \nDCF is able to more precisely report on completion of weekly visitation between parents and \nchildren on a week to week basis for the six month period. Therefore, compliance can now be \nmeasured by the average percentage of children who had weekly visits with their parent each \nweek during the month, not just the number of children who had four visits a month with their \nparent. Due to this change in methodology, it is difficult to make comparisons with previous \nperiods.  \n \nPer agreement with DCF, performance measures related to parent visits with caseworkers and \nparent visits with children do not exclude from calculations those instances where the parent was \nunavailable or because contacts were not required due to documentation concerns. Thus, current \ndata understate actual performance on these measures. \n \nIn recognition of the importance of visits between parents and their children and between \nsiblings, the Children in Court Improvement Committee with membership from DCF, CP&P, \nSCOC, offices of the Law Guardian, the Public Defender, the Attorney General, Administrative \nOffice of the Courts (AOC) and other advocacy organizations developed a Visitation Bench Card \nthat is intended to be used by judges as guidance at hearings and reviews.  The Bench Card, \nwhich was distributed by the AOC to judges statewide in July 2014, highlights relevant \nregulations regarding supervision, frequency and duration, location and additional methods of \ncontact as well as questions a Judge can ask during a court hearing to make decisions regarding \nvisits.   \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Examination of February 2014 data obtained through a manual \naudit and SafeMeasures reporting for the same month indicate that the discrepancy between \ncompliance performance is within three percent; given this finding, the Monitor has decided that \nSafeMeasures data can be appropriately used to report performance for each month this period \nand in the future.   \n \nBetween January and June 2014, performance ranged monthly from 92 to 96 percent of children \nin out-of-home placement with at least one caseworker visit per month in his/her placement (see \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

During the month of June 2014, 92 percent of applicable children had two \nvisits per month during the first two months of an initial or subsequent placement.  Specifically, \nthere were 501 children who were in an initial or subsequent placement and remained in the \nplacement for a full two months; 459 (92%) had documented visits by their workers twice per \nmonth with at least one visit occurring in the placement setting.

Recruitment and Licensure of Resource Family Homes  \n \nDCF’s recruitment and licensure work is designed to provide a sufficient number of family-\nbased settings in which to appropriately place children who need to enter placement. Its focus is \ncurrently on recruiting and licensing more large capacity resource family homes and homes for \nadolescents and for youth who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning or \nIntersex (LGBTQI). The large gains the state has achieved in licensing and placing children in \nkinship homes creates a new challenge: since kinship homes often close once permanency is \nachieved through adoption, kinship legal guardianship status and reunification, DCF must focus \non retention of quality homes and recruiting to more narrowly meet the specific needs of children \nwho cannot be placed with kin.  \n \nDCF recruited and licensed 670 new kinship and non-kinship resource family homes from \nJanuary to June 2014, missing its recruitment target for this period by 18 homes.  Sixty-six \npercent of the newly licensed families were relatives of children in care. \n \nFigure 31:  Number of Licensed Resource Family Homes Compared to Statewide Target \n(January – June 2014) \nTotal = 670 \n \n750\n700\n688\ns\nme 670\no650\nH\nf \no\nr \ne\nb600\nm\nu\nN\n550\n500\nTarget                                                             Actual             \n  Source:  DCF data \n \n \nAs indicated in Figure 31, 440 (66%) of the 670 newly licensed resource family homes during \nthis monitoring period were kinship homes, up from 28 percent in 2007 and reflecting the state’s \ncommitment to exploring kinship care as the preferred placement option. 112 \n   \n                                                 \n112 See Table 12 for total gross and net numbers of resource family homes. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF reported a net \nloss of 172 resource family homes, the first time the state has reported more homes closed than \nlicensed within a monitoring period since the start of the reform effort. DCF attributes this \nchange to increased licensing of kinship resource family homes that tend to close when children \nachieve permanency through adoption, kinship legal guardianship or reunification.  Despite the \nreported net loss this monitoring period, DCF reports that its capacity of resource family homes \ncontinues to exceed the rate of out of home placement needs.  The Monitor will be closely \nmonitoring recruitment and licensing to ensure that DCF maintains sufficient capacity of \nresource family homes, given the recent rise in out-of-home placements.   \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Additional reasons for \nclosing resource homes include a provider’s personal circumstances, such as the health/age of the \nprovider (26%), a move out-of-state (4%) and lack of room for the placement (6%).  Nine \npercent of the resource family home providers did not disclose their reasons for closing their \nhomes. An additional 12 percent of homes were closed for other reasons: abuse or neglect (1%), \ndeath of a provider (1%), a provider’s negative experiences (2%), a provider’s dissatisfaction \nwith CP&P and Office of Licensing (OOL) rules (5%), unmet placement expectations (1%), a \nprovider reaching capacity limitations (1%) and violations of licensing rules (1%).   \n \nDCF is implementing several strategies to reduce resource home closures and to improve \nretention.  Working with Rutgers University, DCF is developing tools to use with its resource \nfamilies to identify areas of concern. With the assistance of Adopt Us Kids, a national \norganization supporting foster and adoptive families, DCF is also developing a Resource Family \nRetention Model for workers to use with families. \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Tables 15 and 16 demonstrate that, \nconsistent with its commitment to license relatives whenever possible, DCF receives more \napplications from kinship family homes than non-kinship homes and that those applications take \nlonger to resolve than the non-kinship family home applications for reasons described in \nprevious reports: once children are placed with relatives there is not as much incentive for \nrelatives to conform to the rigors of the application process.  During the period, for the 773 \nresource family home kinship applications received from July 2013 to December 2013, 386 \n(50%) were resolved within 150 days and 465 (60%) were resolved in 180 days.

Foster and Adoptive Family Services113 (FAFS) assisted DCF by raising awareness of \nthe need for homes for large sibling groups through its website and other social media outlets. \nDCF conducted a special project to help recruit for homes for large sibling groups from its \nexisting pool of licensed resource homes from each Resource Family Unit; all local Resource \nFamily Units reached out to licensed families with a capacity of four to discuss their willingness \nto care for large sibling groups.  \n \nThe state has been using a specialized recruitment strategy to focus attention on identifying, \nrecruiting and licensing these homes, termed “Siblings in Best Settings” or SIBS, which are \ndefined as homes with five or more children or youth. At the end of this reporting period, DCF \nhad 29 SIBS homes, an equivalent number of homes reported at the end of the previous reporting \nperiod; eight SIBS homes were newly licensed between January and June 2014, and eight homes \nleft the SIBs program.114 Recruiting homes for large sibling groups continues to be a priority \nneed. \n \nAssistance from the National Resource Center for Recruitment and Retention of Foster and \nAdoptive Parents (NRCRRFAP) \n \nDCF continued its work with the National Resource Center for Recruitment and Retention of \nFoster and Adoptive Parents at Adopt US Kids (NRCRRFAP) and phased in a market \nsegmentation approach to the remaining nine counties.115  NRCRRFAP’s market segmentation \napproach uses a marketing research tool that helps identify households by geographic area and \nlifestyle characteristics that are most similar to those in which DCF is currently successful in \nplacing children. Local recruiters were trained in the approach and how to apply it to their \nrecruitment efforts and strategies.  DCF is at the beginning stages of quantifying how the market \nsegmentation approach has improved its overall recruitment efforts.   \n \nStaff Training and Skill Development \n \nResource family and licensing staff participated in training opportunities during this monitoring \nperiod, including:  \n \n  PRIDE (Parent Resources for Information, Development and Education) Presentation \nSkills for PRIDE Trainers—this workshop provides the basic skills for developing and \ndelivering effective presentations.  \n  PRIDE Presentation Skills for Recruiters – similar to the workshop for trainers, this \nworkshop provides basic skills for delivering effective presentations for recruiters.    \n                                                 \n113 Foster and Adoptive Family Services is an organization in New Jersey that provides supports and advocacy for \nfoster, adoptive and kinship families. \n114 Eight homes left the SIBS program: six homes downgraded from SIBS status when the children were reunited \nwith their biological parents, one home closed and one home downgraded from SIBS status when the resource \nparents determined the large number of siblings was too difficult to manage. \n115 Bergen, Hudson, Atlantic, Cape May, Union, Hunterdon, Somerset, Warren and Passaic. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Courses include a two day training covering the practice values of SAFE, \na one day training to build or refresh interviewing skills and a course designed to train \nsupervisors.  \n \nResource Family In-service Training  \n \nEvery resource parent is required to complete In-service training to maintain a resource family \nhome license.  The training modalities which are offered to resource parents by FAFS are: on-\nline training, home correspondence courses, county-based workshops and webinars.  Between \nJanuary and June 2014 1,314 resource parents took a total of 3,952 In-service courses. FAFS \noffers a wide variety of topics, including:  \n  \n  Loss and Separation, \n  Post Adoption Issues, \n  Child Safety, \n  Parenting Through Puberty,  \n  Understanding Anger in Children and Adolescents, and \n  Chew on This: A Guide to Diet and Nutrition.  \n \n \n \nB.  Performance Measures on Placement of Children in Out-of-Home Care  \n \nFor several of the outcomes related to placement of children in out-of-home care, the final targets \nare measured at the end of each calendar year.  Consequently, the state’s performance on the \nfollowing placement outcomes is not newly assessed in this report and the most recent \nperformance is from CY 2013 outcomes. \n \n  Performance Measure 25 – Placing Siblings Together:  Of sibling groups of two or three \nsiblings entering custody at the same time or within 30 days of one another, the \npercentage in which all siblings are placed together. \n \nFinal Target – For siblings entering custody in the period beginning July 2012 and \nthereafter, at least 80% will be placed together. \n \nMost Recent Performance – In CY2013, of the 842 sibling groups of two or three \nchildren that came into custody at the same time or within 30 days of one another, 77% \nwere placed together. \n \n  Performance Measure 26 – Placing Siblings Together:  Of sibling groups of four or more \nsiblings entering custody at the same time or within 30 days of one another, the \npercentage in which all siblings are placed together. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Eighty-six of the 90 (96%) child placements were rated acceptable, which is \nexceptional performance.  This assessment considers the child’s needs for family relationships, \nconnections, age, ability, special needs and peer group and whether the living arrangement is \nconsistent with the child’s language and culture. The assessment of appropriateness of placement \nalso considers whether the placement met the child’s needs for emotional support, supervision \nand socialization and addresses special and other basic needs.

Exceptions can \nbe made to these limits as follows: no more than five percent of resource home placements may \nbe made into resource homes with seven or eight total children including the resource family’s \nown children, but such placements can be made as long as there is adherence to the other \nlimitations referred to above.  Any of the limitations may be waived if needed and appropriate to \nallow a group of siblings to be placed together.  \n \nThe Monitor reviews the waivers to population limits DCF has granted during each monitoring \nperiod to validate that they meet the designated capacity limitations.  During this monitoring \nperiod less than one percent of resource home placements were over capacity.  \n \nThe Monitor reviewed the three waivers to populations limits granted between January and June \n2014 and each of these waivers were deemed appropriate. Two waivers were approved for \nchildren to be placed in homes with over four children: one for a child who was related to the \nresource parent and another for a child who had previously been placed in the home and returned \nagain when reunification with family didn’t succeed. Another waiver was approved for a child to \nbe placed in a home with six children because the resource parent’s grandchild had a baby and \nboth were imminently scheduled to leave the home.  \n \nDCF continues to meet the MSA performance target for this outcome.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n117 These data were analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The next day the children were \nmoved from the shelter and placed in separate resource treatment homes, but were reunited into the same treatment \nhome in June 2014. Two additional children were placed in June 2014: one child by an after-hours investigator who \ndid not verify the child’s age and the child was placed into a resource home the next day. A second child under 13 \nwas placed in a shelter in June 2014 when the child refused to return home and DCF could not find a resource home \nthat would meet the family court’s strict conditions of placement for the child, such as no access to the telephone or \ninternet and no male in the home.  The child was reunified by court order following a twelve day placement in the \nall-female setting. It should be noted that there were a total of 5,713 children under 13 in placement in this \nmonitoring period and that three out of the four children under 13 years old placed in shelter were in shelter for one \nday. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF shares this concern and has been \nexamining the issue. Information is being collected through NJ SPIRIT and local reviews of \nchildren who experienced repeat maltreatment are being conducted in order to determine \ncommon themes or practice issues and develop strategies to reduce these occurrences.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n120 DCF has objected to the Monitor’s definition of “qualifying exits” used to analyze this measure.  The Agency \nbelieves that due to the specific exclusion cited in the MSA, the definition of qualifying exits should only exclude \nchildren who run away from placement. The Monitor uses a definition of qualifying exits which excludes from the \ncalculations runaways as well as children who are adopted.  Based on the DCF recommended definition, of all \nchildren who exited in CY2012, 10 percent re-entered custody within one year of the date of exit.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

TIMELY PERMANENCY THROUGH REUNIFICATION, ADOPTION OR \nLEGAL GUARDIANSHIP \n \nAll children—regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity—need and deserve a safe, nurturing \nfamily to protect and guide them. In child welfare work, this is called achieving “permanency” \nand can be achieved through a number of different avenues: safe family reunification is the \npreferred choice, but permanency also includes kinship/guardianship and adoption.  \nAs required by the MSA, the Monitor, in consultation with the parties, developed specific \nmeasures and final targets to determine whether children in custody achieve timely permanency \nthrough reunification, adoption or legal guardianship (Section III.A.2.a). \n \nDuring this monitoring period, although not yet at compliance levels, DCF demonstrated \nimproved performance in the development of child specific recruitment plans within 30 days of \ngoal change to adoption and placement of children in adoptive homes within nine months of \ntermination of parental rights (TPR). Performance fluctuated month to month on filing for TPR \nwithin 60 days of goal change to adoption (this may be attributable to the small number of \napplicable children) and performance does not meet the required target level. DCF continued to \nmeet the MSA target on finalization of adoptions within nine months of placement in an adoptive \nhome.   \n \nIn an effort to further advance adoption practices and outcomes, on September 30, 2014 DCF \nwas awarded a federal grant from the Administration on Children, Youth and Families to secure \npermanent families for children and youth who have waited over 18 months to be adopted.  The \nprogram builds on existing adoption expertise within DCF and will be a collaboration with other \npartner agencies in New Jersey. For example, the Institute for Families at the Rutgers University \nSchool of Social Work will partner with DCF to evaluate and document project outcomes.  \n \nThe state’s performance on the remaining permanency outcomes is not newly assessed in this \nreport as final targets are measured at the end of each calendar year; more recent performance \nwill be assessed in the next monitoring report when these data are available.121 DCF’s most \nrecent performance for each of the MSA five permanency outcomes are bulleted below:  \n \n  Performance Measure 34.a. – Discharged to Permanency: Permanency in first 12 \nmonths: Of all children who entered foster care for the first time in the target year and \nwho remained in foster care for eight days or longer, what percentage was discharged \nfrom foster care to permanency (reunification, permanent relative care, adoption and/or \nguardianship) within 12 months from their removal from home. \n \nFinal Target – Of all children who entered foster care for the first time in CY2011, 50% \nwill have been discharged to permanency (reunification, permanent relative care, \nadoption and/or guardianship) within 12 months from their removal from home.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n121 These data are not available until early 2015.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN OUT-OF-HOME PLACEMENT \n \nThe provision of appropriate health care services to children in DCF’s custody has been a \nprincipal focus of the MSA and the DCF’s reform agenda.  Since June 2011, DCF has generally \nmaintained or improved performance on nearly all performance measures related to health care \nservices.127  These performance measures track DCF’s progress in ensuring that children in out-\nof-home placement receive: \n \n  Pre-placement medical assessments (MSA Section II.F.5); \n  Full medical examinations (known as Comprehensive Medical Examinations or \nCMEs) (MSA Section II.B.11); \n  Medical examinations in compliance with Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis \nand Treatment (EPSDT) guidelines; \n  Semi-annual dental examinations for children ages three and older (MSA Section \nII.F.2); \n  Mental health assessments of children with suspected mental health needs (MSA \nSection II.F.2); \n  Timely, accessible and appropriate follow-up and treatment (MSA Section II.F.2); \nand \n  Immunizations. \n \nThis section provides updates of ongoing efforts to improve policies, staffing and access to \nservices, which are necessary to realize and sustain positive health outcomes for children as well \nas information about the health care received by children in out-of-home placement.128  The \ndelivery of a child’s medical information (through the Health Passport) to a new caregiver within \nfive days of placement in his/her home is also assessed. \n \nDCF regularly carries out a Health Care Case Record Review that analyzes the follow-up care \nchildren receive for concerns identified in CMEs; mental health screenings, assessments and \nfollow-up care; and timely delivery of the health passport to resource parents.  The most recent \ncase record review includes a random sample of children in out-of-home placement who were \nremoved between August 1, 2013 and April 30, 2014 and were in care a minimum of 60 days.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n127 The notable exception is the performance measure requiring 95 percent of caregivers receive a current Health \nPassport within five days of a child’s placement where performance has consistently been below the final tartget. As \nof April 30, 2014, performance is 62 percent. \n128 The Monitor has previously verified health care outcomes through a case record review.

Health Care Delivery System \n \nChild Health Units \n \nThe Child Health Units are a fundamental cornerstone of the provision of health care to children \nin CP&P custody.  These units are in each CP&P Local Office and are staffed with a managing \nClinical Nurse Coordinator, nurse Health Care Case Managers and staff assistants based on the \nprojected number of children in out-of-home placement.  A regional nurse administrator \nsupervises local units for a particular region (aligned with the Area Offices).  DCF worked with \nUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey’s School of Nursing’s François-Xavier \nBagnoud Center (FXB)129 and CP&P Local Offices to build these units.  As part of their duties, \nthese staff members are responsible for tracking and advocating for the health needs of children \nwho enter into out-of-home care.  Since the creation of health care units and assignment of \nnurses to children in out-of-home care, DCF has achieved and sustained substantial results.   \n \nThe Child Health Units are operational in all CP&P Local Offices.  DCF reports that as of June \n2014, staffing goals of the Child Health Units allow for 236 nurses and nurse supervisors and \n100 support staff.  DCF reports that each Local Office is generally fully staffed.  Every child in a \nresource home continues to have a nurse assigned for health care management.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n129 As of July 1, 2013, the University of Medicine and Dentistry merged with Rutgers, The State University of New \nJersey. The UMDNJ-School of Nursing is now Rutgers School of Nursing. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Health Care Performance Measures \n \nPre-Placement Medical Assessment \n \n39. Pre-Placement Medical Assessment:  Number/percent of children receiving pre-\nQuantitative or \nplacement medical assessment in a non-emergency room setting or other setting \nQualitative Measure \nappropriate to the situation.130 \nBy December 31, 2009, 98% of children will receive a pre-placement assessment \neither in a non-emergency room setting, or in an emergency room setting if the child \nFinal Target \nneeded emergency medical attention or the child was already in the emergency room \nwhen CP&P received the referral. \n \n \nFigure 41:  Percentage of Children who Received Pre-Placement Assessment in a \nNon-Emergency Room Setting or Other Settings Appropriate to the Situation \n(June 2009 – June 2014) \n \n100%\nFinal Target \n98% 98% 98% 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% (98%) \n90%\n92%\nn\ne\nr\nd\nhil 80%\nC\nof \nge  70%\na\nnt\ne\nc\nr\ne 60%\nP\n50%\nJun-09 Dec-09 Jun-10 Dec-10 Jun-11 Dec-11 Jun-12 Dec-12 Jun-13 Dec-13 Jun-14\nJun-09    Dec-09    Jun-10    Dec-10    Jun-11   Dec-11   Jun-12         Mar-13           Dec-13   Jun-14\nMonth\nSource:  DCF data \nData in this figure are not point in time for the month but represent performance over the monitoring \nperiod which ends in the month indicated in the figure.   \n \nPerformance as of June 30, 2014: \n \nAll children entering out-of-home care are required to have a pre-placement assessment and the \nvast majority of these assessments should be in a non-emergency room setting (MSA Section \nII.F.5).  Child Health Unit nurses, clinics and sometimes the child’s own pediatrician provide \nthese assessments. \n                                                 \n130 By agreement of the parties, this measure has been redrafted to combine the percentage of PPAs in a non-ER \nsetting and those PPAs conducted in an ER that are appropriate based on the presenting medical needs of the \nchild/youth or because the child/youth was already in the ER when CP&P received the referral.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Of those 2,619 children, 2,223 \n(85%) received the PPA in a non-emergency room setting.  Three hundred and ninety-six (15%) \nreceived a PPA in an emergency room setting. During this period, DCF conducted an internal \nreview of all 396 PPAs that occurred in an emergency room and determined that 375 were \nappropriate for the situation; that is, the child needed emergency medical attention or the child \nwas already in the emergency room when CP&P received the referral.132  Thus, 99 percent of \nchildren received a PPA in a setting appropriate to the situation—85 percent received PPAs in a \nnon-ER setting and an additional 14 percent appropriately received a PPA in an ER setting.133  \nDCF continues to meet the MSA standard regarding appropriate settings for PPAs. \n \n   \n                                                 \n131 Percentage is 100 due to rounding. \n132 In monitoring Period XII, the Monitor reviewed back-up data provided by DCF regarding the PPAs occurring in \nan emergency room setting and agreed with DCF determinations regarding appropriate or inappropriate use of the \nER for PPAs.  In addition, the Monitor’s previous Health Care Case Record Review found that many of the PPAs \noccurring in an ER were because the child had an injury requiring ER treatment or had been brought to the ER by \nthe police or other service provider. \n133 Of 2,619 children receiving PPAs, 2,223 (85%) were in a nonemergency room setting and 375 (14%) were \nappropriately seen in an ER. In addition, for 21 of the 396 children who had their PPA in an ER setting, DCF’s \ninternal review found no evidence to support that the PPA taking place in the ER was appropriate.  Thus, less than \none percent of children received their PPA in an inappropriate setting. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

A CME involves a \ncomprehensive physical, including a developmental history and evaluation, and an initial mental \nhealth screening.134  Mental health screenings determine if a child has a suspected mental health \nneed.135 If a child is suspected to have a mental health need, a full mental health evaluation is \nthen expected to be conducted.  \n \nDCF sustained performance ensuring that 84 percent of children136 received a CME within the \nfirst 30 days of placement and 97 percent of children received a CME within the first 60 days. \n                                                 \n134Another type of CME is the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for Children (CHEC) model which requires a three \npart examination: medical, neurodevelopmental and mental health assessments and can only be administered by a \nlimited number of medical providers in New Jersey.     \n135 In addition to the expectation that mental health screenings occur as part of the CME, DCF directs Health Care \nCase Managers to conduct mental health screenings with children in out-of-home placements who are age two and \nabove and not already receiving mental health services.  Health Care Case Managers conduct these screenings \nwithin the first two weeks of a child’s placement.     \n136 Monitor considers performance met if it is within one percentage point of final target. Final target for this \nmeasure is that 85% of children receive a CME within the first 30 days of placement. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Ninety-one percent of children age two and above \nalso received the required EPSDT well-child examinations (see Figure 45 and Table 24).  This \nperformance is a slight decline as compared to previous monitoring periods and is below the \nMSA final target of 98 percent of children in care for one year or more receiving timely EPSDT \nwell-child examinations.137  However, this slight decline does not negate the sustained access to \nmedical care that children in out-of-home placement are able to receive in the state of New \nJersey.  The Monitor continues to assess compliance with this performance measure as partially \nmet. \n \nNJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures provide reports on when a child receives an EPSDT examination, \nbut neither have the ability to determine whether or not a child is clinically up-to-date with these \nexams. A child may be noted in NJ SPIRIT as not up-to-date if at the EPSDT visit the child was \nsick (children must be well for such visits to be considered EPSDT visits) or the visit was \nmissed, but rescheduled within a close time period.  Also, especially notable for younger \nchildren, once a child is off schedule, they will remain off schedule within DCF’s data system for \nall subsequent EPSDT exams.

This Health Passport records all relevant health history and \ncurrent health status of the child and should be regularly updated and made available to resource \nparents, children (if old enough) and their parents.   \n \nBased on DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record Review of 362 cases, there is evidence that \nHealth Passports are shared with the child’s caregiver within the first five days of placement in \n62 percent of cases (see Table 26) which does not meet the MSA final target.  However, within \n30 days of the placement, DCF data show the Health Passport has been shared with 98 percent of \ncaregivers, consistent with performance from the last two monitoring period.   \n \nThe Health Passport organizes health information from a range of sources including any findings \nof the PPA.  DCF policy requires that the Health Care Case Manager complete the Health \nPassport, which is maintained by the CP&P Local Office Child Health Unit, and provide it to the \nresource parent within 72 hours of the child’s placement.  This is a more stringent policy than the \nMSA requirement that the Health Passport be conveyed to the child’s caregiver within five days. \nHowever, DCF continues to be unable to consistently meet its internal timeframe or the five day \nrequirement set in the MSA. Further, evidence suggests that Health Passports produced within 72 \nhours, or even five days, frequently cannot contain meaningful medical information.  The \nMonitor and parties have met to discuss this measure and consider whether a more effective \nmeasure can be designed that assesses how and in what timeframes meaningful medical \ninformation about children can reasonably be collected and timely shared with their caregivers.  \nNo agreement has been reached as of this time.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

MENTAL HEALTH CARE \n \nDCF continues to work on improving its mental health delivery system by expanding the \nservices and supports under the Division of Children’s System of Care.  DCF also has \nmaintained performance meeting the MSA performance measures requiring that children receive \ntimely mental health assessments and children and youth received appropriate, evidence-based \nmental health services to prevent their entry into CP&P custody. \n \nA.  Mental Health Delivery System \n \nDCF’s Division of Children's System of Care (CSOC) serves children and adolescents with \nemotional, behavioral health, developmental and intellectual disabilities and co-occurring \nconditions.  Beginning in 2012, the provision of services to children with developmental and \nintellectual disabilities, formerly under the purview of the Department of Human Services \n(DHS), transitioned to CSOC. DCF reports an increased use in case management services in part \ndue to the long-term impact of Super Storm Sandy and the expansion of services to youth with \nthe dual diagnosis of developmental and intellectual disabilities and youth with co-occurring \nsubstance abuse challenges.  \n \nIn October 2012 New Jersey received approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (CMS) for a Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver focused, in part, on increasing supports \nfor children and youth who have a risk of hospital level care (children/youth considered to be \nseriously emotionally disturbed). This waiver has two pilot programs—one that focuses on \nchildren and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD pilot) and one that focuses on \nincreasing services for youth with a developmental disability and a behavioral health concern \n(DD/MI pilot).  The ASD pilot has rolled out and now Applied Behavioral Analysis, an \nevidenced based practice for youth with Autism, is available for 200 youth receiving Medicaid.  \nThe DD/MI pilot is intended to provide 200 individuals with care management and intensive in-\nhome services.  DCF reports still working on several components of this pilot. \n \nThe number of children placed out-of-state for treatment remains low. \n \nDCF continues to be successful in minimizing the number of children in CP&P custody placed in \nout-of-state congregate care settings. (MSA Section II.D.2). As of June 30, 2014, there were \nthree youth in out-of-state residential placements. All three youth were in a specialized program \nfor the deaf or hard of hearing.  DCF worked collaboratively with the state’s Department of \nEducation, primarily with staff of New Jersey’s Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, to \ndevelop an in-state program to provide residential mental health treatment for five to eight youth. \nProgram services will be provided by St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center.  DCF reports \nthat during the monitoring period the facility underwent updates and renovations. In November \n2014, renovations were completed and the facility was licensed. As of late-December 2014, DCF \nreports that two of the three youth have been relocated to the new program.  \n   \nFigure 51 shows the number of children placed out-of-state from June 2011 to June 2014.  \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

FFT continues to be available in seven counties: Atlantic, Cape \nMay, Burlington, Ocean, Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem.  For the last quarter of the \nmonitoring period, each program’s average census was 81 percent of the program’s capacity, a \nfive percent increase since the last monitoring period.

Continued Support for Family Success Centers: DCF shall continue to support a \nQualitative Measure  statewide network of Family Success Centers. \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \n \nPerformance as of June 30, 2014: \n \nNew Jersey began developing a network of Family Success Centers (FSCs) in 2007, initially \nwith 21 centers.  Now, in its seventh year, New Jersey has a total of 52 FSCs, at least one in each \nof the 21 counties.  \n \nFSCs are neighborhood-based places where any community resident can access family support, \ninformation and services, and specialized supports that tend to vary depending on the needs and \ndesires of the community in which they are located. Their function is to provide resources and \nsupports before families fall into crisis.  FSCs are situated in many types of settings: storefronts, \nhouses, schools, houses of worship and public housing. Services, which are available to any \nfamily free of charge, range from life skills training, parent and child activities, advocacy, parent \neducation and housing related activities.   \n \nSince Superstorm Sandy in October 2012, New Jersey’s FSCs have become gateways to reach \nfamilies in the counties that were hit the hardest by the storm. FSCs now offer day to day support \nand a place to build and restore community.  With the addition of post Sandy federal support, \nDCF’s Office of Family Support Services (OFSS) has provided additional funding to some FSCs \nin the areas of highest need to offer psychosocial and family strengthening events and \ncommunity building activities.147 \n \nBetween January and June 2014, DCF’s OFSS funded the opening of Oceanside FSC in Atlantic \nCity, one of the areas most severely affected by the storm. Oceanside FSC, which became \noperational in July 2014, is an example of one of the centers that offers individuals and families \nenhanced services, including those mentioned above.  \n \nDCF collects data on the number of individuals and families served by the FSCs.  \nTable 28 shows the unduplicated number of people served by New Jersey’s FSCs from January \nto June 2014. Table 29 shows the contracted services provided by FSCs statewide to people \nbetween January and June 2014. General information and referral and linkage to other services is \nthe most frequently used service, followed by services related to life skills and advocacy.  \n \n                                                 \n147 OFSS provided additional funding to Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, \nMonmouth, Ocean and Union counties. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SERVICES TO OLDER YOUTH \n \nDuring Phase I of the MSA, DCF created and promoted policies to provide continued support \nand services to youth aged 18 to 21.  Beginning in CY2013 and continuing throughout this \nmonitoring period, DCF has been updating policies and practices to provide appropriate \nguidance to workers and other staff to support well-being and permanency for youth while \ninvolved with DCF as well as to achieve better outcomes for youth after they exit care.  \n \nDiscussed below are new developments and updates to current practices and strategies utilized \nby DCF to provide services for older youth in the following areas: housing; education; \nemployment; financial literacy; health care; expectant and parenting youth; LGBTQI services; \nand increasing staff skills.  Following the practice updates, progress toward the Phase II \nperformance measures is provided.   \n \nA.  Updates to Current Practices \n \nHousing  \n \nDuring this monitoring period, DCF contracted for 390 transitional and supported housing slots \nfor older youth who are seeking housing, aging out of care or are homeless; 385 of these slots \nwere used during the monitoring period (see Table 30). The Office of Adolescent Services \n(OAS) reports that data are being collected across the state related to youth housing needs in \norder to plan and make necessary adjustments to existing housing programs.  OAS is continuing \nto work with providers listed on the Adolescent Housing Hub (AHH), a real-time automated \nhousing slot tracking and referral system, to determine how to strengthen use of the system.  In \nMay 2014, three AHH provider focus groups were conducted to identify strategies to improve \nutilization of this system.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Some of these strategies and programs are discussed below. \n \nDCF continues to offer the New Jersey Foster Care (NJFC) Scholars Program, which provides \nassistance with tuition and fees to eligible current and former foster youth148 in order to pursue \npost-secondary education at an accredited two or four year college, university, trade or career \nschool. Data for recent participation are bulleted below:  \n \n  Between January and June 2014 (spring 2014 semester), 349 youth participated in the \nNJFC program; 251 (72%) youth utilized funding. DCF reports the remaining youth did \nnot utilize Scholars program funding because the financial aid provided by their \neducational institutions covered their expenses. \n \n  For the entire 2013-2014 academic year (July 1, 2013 – June 30, 2014), DCF reports that \n367 unduplicated youth participated in the NJFC program; 296 (81%) youth utilized \nfunding during the academic year and the remaining youth did not utilize Scholars \nprogram funding because the financial aid provided by their educational institutions \ncovered their expenses. \n \nThe number of youth enrolled in the Scholars program has increased since the 2011-2012 \nacademic year when 316 students participated. Outreach efforts continue by Foster and Adoptive \nFamily Services (FAFS), the agency which administers the Scholars program.  Between January \nand June 2014, FAFS hosted or participated in 38 outreach events which were attended by a total \nof 268 youth and 131 adults.   \n \nDCF reports that all youth enrolled in the Scholars program received support services through \nProject MYSELF which is administrated by the Transitions for Youth at the Institute for Families \nthrough the Rutgers School of Social Work. Project MYSELF is a multi-service mentoring \nprogram designed to improve academic performance, increase post-secondary education \nretention and completion and develop life skills and competencies. Recently, the “tier-system” \nused by the program to identify youth in need of increased support was updated. The update \ndefines the two tiers as follows:  \n \n  “Tier-One” students are first-year NJFC scholars with below a 2.0 GPA for the previous \nsemester, enrolled in remedial courses and who have had appeals granted to re-enter the \nprogram. These students receive a minimum of bi-weekly contact with at least one face-\nto-face meeting per month. \n \n                                                 \n148 Eligible youth must have a high school diploma or GED and be admitted to a degree or certificate granting post-\nsecondary institution that has been accredited to receive Title IV funding.  Additional eligibility requirements, \nincluding length of time in out-of-home placement or age at adoption, can be found at \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/adolescent/involved/scholars/   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

These students receive a minimum of \nmonthly contact from their support coach by telephone or email.  If needed, crisis \nintervention services can be provided and support coach contact can be increased.  \n \nOf the 367 students served in the 2013-2014 academic year, 227 were “Tier-One” and 140 were \n“Tier-Two” students. \n \nDCF continues to fund the Summer Housing Internship (SHIP) and Summer Internship \nPrograms (SIP) which provide academic, social and cultural opportunities for 60 youth who \nattend post-secondary educational institutions. SHIP also provides housing for youth involved in \nthe child welfare system during the summer school break. The programs extend 11 weeks over \nthe summer months and offer paid internships, skill building groups, recreational activities, one-\non-one mentoring and coaching and a three-credit academic research course through Rutgers \nUniversity. OAS reports an increased demand for this program with almost 100 applications \nreceived for the 60 slots (40 SHIP slots and 20 SIP slots) available the previous registration \nperiod.  \n  \nFinally, the DCF Scholarship Fund was established to provide scholarships to eligible youth who \nhave a high school diploma or GED and have had at least six cumulative months of CP&P \nplacement after age 12. Scholarships provide up to $2,500 per academic year and are intended to \nassist youth who do not qualify for the NJFC Scholars program or youth who participate in the \nNJFC Scholars program and are in need of additional assistance to cover the expense of their \npost-secondary education.  Scholarship applications were initially made available in May 2013 \nand between January and June 2014, 11 students were awarded scholarships through this fund.  \n \nEmployment  \n \nNew this monitoring period, the Youth Employment Coordinator (YEC) within OAS organized \ntraining to staff and providers on utilizing the New Jersey Career Assistance Navigator \n(NJCAN). Training was delivered by the NJ Department of Education in collaboration with the \nJohn J. Heldrich Center. NJCAN is a free, web-based career guidance system that can assist \nyouth in exploring different career paths and planning for necessary educational and skill \ndevelopment tasks for these careers.  YEC facilitated additional presentations and trainings on \nNJCAN at the Quarterly Networking Meeting, Adolescent Practice Forums, Union County \nYouth Recognition Day and Outreach to At-Risk Youth (OTARY) program providers meeting.   \n \nThe YEC assisted with efforts to incorporate youth voice into workforce policy planning and \nformation and drafted a proposal for Casey Family Programs Technical Assistance regarding \nyouth employment practices. Additionally, the YEC collaborated with the U.S. Department of \nLabor, Office of Apprenticeship to conduct presentations to Local Office staff and providers on \napprenticeship programs.    \n \nOTARY programs continue to provide at-risk youth with enhanced educational, vocational and \nrecreational services at 21 sites throughout New Jersey. DCF reports that OAS continues to visit \nthese programs and provide technical assistance and consultation.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As of June 30, 2014, 172 youth were either actively engaged in or completed the \ncourse.  During the 2013-2014 school year, 96 students were fully certified. \n \nMedicaid Extension for Youth Adults  \n \nThe Office of Child and Family Health (OCFH) administers the Medicaid Extension for Youth \nAdults (MEYA) and adjusted the program based upon the new federal health care law which \nbecame effective January 1, 2014. OCFH continues to work with the Division of Medical \nAssistance and Health Services (NJ’s single state Medicaid agency), the DCF Office of \nInformation Technology, OAS and CP&P to design the program and develop a plan for \nimplementation. Work to date includes:  \n \n  development of a new Medicaid code to identify youth between the ages of 18 to 26 who \nare eligible for continued Medicaid;  \n  eligibility determinations for former foster youth and youth who are turning 18 years old \nin the month are completed by NJ SPIRIT;  \n  informational flyer and wallet sized cards with MEYA information have been developed \nand are distributed to Local Offices, provider agencies and other community partners; \n  presentations on the Medicaid extension were made to Area Directors, Local Office \nManagers, adolescent unit workers and provider agencies; and  \n  MEYA support line is available for caseworkers, youth, relatives of youth, provider \nagencies and others.   \n \nRecent data indicate that the majority of youth who exit care needing Medicaid receive Medicaid \nfor at least one month following discharge.  Specifically, of the 157 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 who \nwere discharged from placement between January and June 2014 and needed Medicaid, 149 \n(95%) youth had Medicaid for at least one month. Additionally, between July 1, 2013 and \nDecember 31, 2013, 181 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 were discharged from placement and needed \nMedicaid; 154 (85%) of these youth received Medicaid for at least six months.   \n \nExpectant and Parenting Youth  \n \nIn March 2014, OAS hired an Expectant and Parenting Youth Specialist to identify statewide \ncommunity resources and services gaps for pregnant and parenting teens. A resource guide is \nbeing developed which will include resources for fatherhood programs, nutrition and food \nsupport, child support, home visitation, social services and housing programs.  \n \nServices for LGBTQI Population \n \nThe MSA requires DCF to develop and begin to implement a plan for appropriate service \ndelivery to youth who identify as LGBTQI (MSA Section II.C.4).  DCF has continued to \nimplement strategies and services to meet the needs of this population, primarily through the \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF has identified 160 Safe Space liaisons for all CP&P Local and Area \nOffices. Activities this monitoring period focused on identification of LGBTQI youth and \nfamilies, services and resources, addressing LGBTQI case practice concerns, educating the \npublic, improving Safe Space programming, developing draft policy and a proposal for cultural \ncompetency training for DCF staff. Additionally, OAS has a LGBTQI Coordinator who provides \neducation and consultation to staff and community partners.   \n \nIncreasing Staff Skills \n \nIn September 2012, OAS began offering quarterly training on adolescent policy, practice and \nresources to staff.  The one-day training is mandatory for adolescent supervisors and workers and \nother CP&P staff who work with youth are encouraged to attend. As part of continuous quality \nimprovement efforts, OAS determined during this monitoring period that enhancements and \nupdates to the training curriculum were needed and training was not offered this period. DCF \nreports that training sessions resumed in August 2014.  \n \nIn September 2013, 40 staff were enrolled in the Adolescent Advocacy program—a post-B.A., 15 \ncredit certificate through Montclair State University focused on adolescent advocacy and case \npractice. DCF reports that the program continued to operate as scheduled during this monitoring \nperiod.  \n \nThe OAS provides a variety of technical assistance to the field on adolescent policy and practice.  \nDuring the monitoring period, OAS hosted regional practice forums for cross agency staff in \nMarch and June on topics relevant to adolescent practice.149  Approximately 40 staff attended \neach of the eight forums offered.  Topics discussed at the practice forums included Medicaid \nextension to the age of 26, new structure of the Youth Advisory Boards, permanency initiatives, \neducational initiatives, trauma-informed care, youth engagement, updates on the Children’s \nSystem of Care (CSOC) and employment resources.  These forums also provide an opportunity \nfor OAS to receive feedback from staff on policies and to strategize on efforts to improve \nservices, resources and case practice tools.  \n \nOther Developments  \n \nBeginning in mid-2013, DCF developed a new structure for its Youth Advisory Board (YAB) \nmodel and has been working with the Rutgers School of Social Work for implementation.  \nFifteen YABs have been created statewide as well as one Youth Advisory Council which is \ncomposed of youth from CP&P, CSOC, the Division of Family and Community Partnerships and \nthe Office of Education.  The YABs meet twice a month and activities include identifying topics \nor policy for further study and impact, performing service activities and participation in cultural \nevents. During this monitoring period, YAB youth created a Facebook page; presented at several \nmeetings and forums; and met with the Commissioner and DCF leadership to share policy and \npractice concerns and recommendations including ensuring visitation rooms are warm and \n                                                 \n149 Staff are from CP&P, the DCF Office of Education and the Children’s System of Care, Care Management \nOrganizations. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The goal of this grant is to improve educational, employment, permanency and well-\nbeing outcomes for older youth involved with CP&P.  DCF is currently working on the data \nanalysis and needs assessment component of this project. Specifically, on June 26, 2014, a \nSystems Mapping Event was held with 80 stakeholder participants, including youth with a \nhistory in care, to outline gaps in services and proposed interventions. As part of the data \nanalysis work, a MOU was signed to receive data from NJ’s Housing, Mortgage Finance Agency \nin order to secure Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data.   \n \n \n \nB.  Performance Measures Measuring Services to Older Youth \n \nAs of June 30, 2014, CP&P served 3,018 youth aged 18 to 21; current information indicates that \n465 (15%) youth were living in a CP&P out-of-home placement; 1,549 (51%) youth were living \nin their own homes;150 and 1,004 (33%) youth were receiving adoption or kinship legal \nguardianship subsidies. \n \n   \n                                                 \n150 DCF is further analyzing these data to better understand the exact setting(s) indicated for the youth categorized as \n“living in their own homes” which can include, among other things, youth living with family, youth in independent \nliving.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

In rating these cases, reviewers utilize \nthe standard QR protocol and a list of additional considerations to enhance the protocol to \nexamine additional needs such as planning and supports for youth who identify as LGBTQI, are \nvictims of domestic violence, are pregnant or parenting or are developmentally disabled.  By \nagreement between the Monitor and CP&P, cases were considered acceptable for this measure if \nthe QR ratings were within the acceptable range (4-6) for both the overall Child/Youth and \nFamily Indicator and Practice Performance Indicator.   \n \nFourteen (70%) of the 20 cases reviewed were rated acceptable on both the Child/Youth and \nFamily Indicator and Practice Performance Indicator. Additional cases are scheduled to be \nreviewed in CY2014 and ratings for all cases reviewed during the year will be included in the \nnext monitoring report.   \n \nDCF analyzed the data collected through reviews completed in 2012 and 2013 and developed \nrecommendations and next steps for practice.151  These recommendations and updates provided \nby DCF on implementation are bulleted below:  \n \n1.  DCF should reinforce with its caseworkers the use of the Transition Plans through \nsupervision and practice forums, ensuring that they are reflective of the youth’s needs, voice \nand provide realistic and developmentally attainable goals for success.   \n \nDCF Update: OAS has been working with CP&P, OIT and Policy to update the existing \ntransition plan to include more specific information around certain domains, including \nhousing, education and employment.  The updated plan is called Transitional Plan for YOUth \nSuccess was launched in September 2014 and will be added to NJ Spirit in January 2015. \n \n2.  DCF should strengthen the use of teaming for older youth through supervision, case \nconferencing and coaching, acknowledging different techniques and formats may be \nnecessary.   \n                                                 \n151 Specific findings and recommendations are included in a report released in July 2014.

The emphasis on teaming, conferencing and \nflexible approaches and techniques for engagement will be included in these trainings.    \n \n3.  CP&P staff must integrate both the formal and informal assessment of the needs of the older \nyouth into case planning and reinforce it through supervision and case conferencing.  \n \nDCF Update: OAS reports that the trainings which are currently being updated will include \ninformation on utilizing available assessments to identify and address youth needs.  The \nTransitional Plan for YOUth Success training will also specifically outline the use of the \nIndependent Living Assessment to drive this planning and goal setting process.  \n \n4.  CP&P must pay particular attention to planning with older youth for the upcoming transition \nof living independently from the child welfare system.   \n \nDCF Update: DCF reports that the updated transitional plan will assist staff in having \nconversations and planning with youth around education, employment, housing, life skills, \nhealth, and connections.  \n \n5.  Lifelong and sustaining relationships with committed adults must be strengthened to create \npermanency for older youth.   \n \nDCF Update: OAS reports contracting with several community agencies to provide \npermanency services to youth.  These services work with youth ages 14 to 21 to help the \nyouth achieve relational or legal permanency.  Planning around implementing Permanency \nRoundtables on a more consistent basis has occurred as well.   \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUPPORTING A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE:  CASELOADS AND \nTRAINING \n \nDCF continued to meet average office caseload standards for Permanency and Adoption workers \nand individual caseload standards for permanency workers, and has met the average office \ncaseload standard for Intake workers during this monitoring period. DCF continued to meet \nindividual caseload standards for Permanency workers but did not meet individual caseload \nstandards for Intake, IAIU and Adoption workers.   \n \nAlthough not in this monitoring period, in mid-November 2014, a caseworker was severely \ninjured in an attack by a CP&P client with a knife at the DCF office in the city of Camden. \nFortunately, the worker is recovering but the attack elevated concerns by DCF managers, \nfrontline staff and union officials about safety issues for workers in their offices and when they \nare in the field.  DCF leaders responded quickly in terms of meeting with workers and launching \nefforts to fully understand and address the magnitude of existing challenges to worker safety. A \ncontractor expert in providing trauma support to first responders was immediately deployed to \nmeet with groups of staff. Since the incident, DCF reports that it has also deployed security \nofficers with metal detecting wands at all Local Offices and in some offices has installed panic \nbuttons in meeting rooms and increased the availability of shuttles to transport staff to court. \nDCF policy also includes a buddy system which allows workers with supervisory approval to be \naccompanied by a colleague when they are concerned about going into the field on their \nown.  Although line workers have reported inconsistent processes for approval for use of \nbuddies, DCF leaders have indicated willingness to increase the use of the buddy system to \naddress worker security concerns.  DCF leadership has also launched a more systematic review \nof worker safety issues statewide.  \n \nThe child welfare workers union and some outside advocates have called for rescinding a recent \nchange that occurred in mid-November 2014 to centralize the dispatch of Human Services Police \n(employed by the State Department of Human Services (DHS)), who had previously been housed \nin many DCF Local Offices including Camden, but are now dispatched from three central \nlocations in the state. The assignment of Human Services Police Officers to selected Local \nOffices was one of the early steps taken by the state as part the child welfare reform efforts to \nrecruit and retain a high quality workforce. Prior to this most recent change, the state had 27 \nHuman Services Police Officers stationed during business hours at approximately 20 Local \nOffices.  Under the new policy, Human Services Police are assigned to one of three dispatch \noffices located on state hospital facility grounds and are centrally dispatched via phone and fax \nrequests by Local Offices workers.  These officers are also now expected to be accessible 24 \nhours a day. DHS believes that this change will promote efficiency and provide better overall \nservice.  Some local staff however believe that the presence of these officers at Local Offices \nwas an important support that will be missed.  \n \nGiven the critical importance of addressing safety issues in order to ensure a stable and qualified \nworkforce, DCF officials have launched a review of safety issues at each Local Office and have \nindicated to the Monitor that they will closely track the impact of the recent change in the \ndeployment of Human Services Police. The Monitor has expressed concern that worker safety is \ninextricably related to DCF’s ability to maintain a stable and high quality workforce and that all \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The state \nis now developing a process to track and assess the impact of these recent changes to the \ndeployment of Human Services Police and the effect of new safety initiatives that are being put \nin place.  The Monitor will be closely assessing all of the actions taken over the next few months \nto address the issues raised.   \n \nA.  Caseloads \n \nCaseload compliance is measured by individual caseworker caseloads in each of the functional \nareas (Intake, Permanency, Adoption and IAIU) as well as office standards for CP&P Local \nOffices. Office-wide average caseloads are to comply with the applicable functional area \ncaseload standards in 95 percent of all CP&P Local Offices and at least 95 percent of workers in \neach of the functional areas are to have individual caseloads meeting the designated standard \n(MSA Section III.B.1).

One-hundred sixty workers were selected from those \nactive in June 2014.  All of the 46 CP&P Local Offices were represented in the sample.  The \ninterviews were conducted throughout the months of July and August 2014.  All 160 workers \nwere called.  Information was collected from 128 workers (86% of the eligible sample), located \nin all 46 Local Offices.  Six workers were on extended leave during the period of the calls, and \nwere removed from the sample. Two workers who declined to participate and another four who \nwere newly assigned to their position for less than half of the monitoring period were also \nremoved from the sample. The Monitor attempted contact at least three times for each worker.   \n \nDuring the interviews, workers were asked if their caseloads met caseload standards between \nJanuary and June 2014 and their responses were compared to the caseload information the state \nsupplied for the same period from NJ SPIRIT.  Workers were also asked to report their specific \ncaseload size for the month of June 2014.  The Monitor is satisfied that sufficient information \nwas gathered to verify the accuracy of the state’s caseload reporting and that, in general, NJ \nSPIRIT accurately reflects worker caseloads.  \n \nThe following discussion describes the state’s performance in meeting the office caseload \nstandards and the individual caseload standards.   \n \nDCF met the standard for average office caseloads for all three functional areas during this \nmonitoring period. Figures 55-57 summarize the Period XV performance on meeting Local \nOffices average caseload standards.  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

According to DCF procedure, all CPS family reports and CWS family referrals \nare assigned to Intake workers to investigate and these reports are reflected in caseload reporting \nas one of the eight referrals in the month of the report and as one of the Intake worker’s 12 open \nfamilies for that month. However, when circumstances indicate that a family with an already \nopen permanency case is the subject of a new CPS family report, the work with the family \nbecomes the shared responsibility of both Intake and Permanency workers until the investigation \nis completed.   \n \nIntake workers are assigned a secondary worker designation in NJ SPIRIT on a shared case for a \nfamily who is currently assigned to a Permanency worker. According to DCF, this arrangement \nemphasizes the primary role of the Permanency worker in securing placement, facilitating visits, \nsupporting the family to implement the case plan and coordinating services. It also reflects the \nPermanency worker’s responsibility to provide information to the Intake worker and to link the \nfamily to appropriate services and supports identified during the course of the new investigation, \nthus relieving the Intake worker of the case management responsibility for the case.  Intake \nworkers continue to be responsible for the work required to complete investigative tasks and to \nreach and document an investigative finding.  The designation as a secondary worker is not \nreflected as an open family for the Intake worker’s caseload and is not categorized as an open \nfamily in monthly caseload reports.  Thus, these secondary assignments are counted as one of the \nIntake workers’ eight new referrals assigned in a month, but are not counted as part of their 12 \nopen families in a month.  \n \nDCF reports that Intake supervisors in CP&P Local Offices are expected to appropriately \nmanage the workload of staff in their units and consider an Intake worker’s primary and \nsecondary responsibilities when assigning new referrals.  The following table (Table 32) \nprovides the reported number of secondary assignments to Intake workers by month for this \nmonitoring period.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Specifically, in the month \nof June 2014, 306 (33%) Intake workers received two or more secondary assignments.  Of those \n306 workers, 136 (44%) had a total of 12 open families or less for the month, including their \nsecondary case assignments.   \n \nDuring phone interviews with caseworkers, the Monitor inquired about the prevalence of \nsecondary assignments and their impact on a worker’s workload. Intake workers were asked how \nprevalent secondary assignments are, what effect these assignments have on their workload and \nhow they are measured.  Of the 77 Intake workers interviewed, 71 (92%) reported receiving an \nassignment to investigate a new report on an open permanency case as a secondary worker at \nleast once in the six month period between January and June 2014 and 45 (58%) reported \nreceiving at least one secondary assignment per month. Sixty-eight of the 71 (96%) Intake \nworkers confirmed that their supervisor appropriately counts secondary assignments toward their \neight new referrals for the month.  Forty-three of the 71 (61%) Intake workers interviewed \nresponded that in their opinion, the workload for an investigation on an open Permanency case in \nwhich they are designated as secondary worker is equivalent to, or sometimes more than, the \nworkload for an initial investigation. Workers explained that although Permanency workers may \nhave completed collateral contacts or are able to provide information about the family’s \ncircumstances, every investigation must be approached in the same manner regardless of primary \nor secondary status.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Both Intake and Permanency \nworkers were asked if they received clear policy guidance on their role and on the division of \nlabor for these shared cases.  Of the 71 Intake workers who reported receiving an assignment to \ninvestigate a new report on an open permanency case as a secondary worker, 61 (86%) reported \nreceiving clear policy guidance and 44 (62%) found the division of labor to be clear. Twenty-one \n(68%) of the 31 Permanency workers interviewed reported receiving clear policy guidance and \n20 (65%) found the division of responsibilities to be clear.  The most frequently cited reason by \nboth Intake and Permanency workers for the lack of clarity in the division of responsibilities was \nthe inconsistent application of the policy which varied by supervisor.  \n  \nThe Monitor further examined secondary case assignments during a case record review on the \nquality of investigative practice conducted in September 2014.  This review examined the quality \nof practice of 313 CPS investigations assigned to DCF Local Offices between February 1 and 14, \n2014.  Fifty (16%) of the 313 CPS investigations were intakes on CP&P cases already open for \nservices.  Of those 50 investigations, 32 (64%) were of acceptable quality, which is slightly \nbelow the quality rating of 81 percent for all investigations excluding these 50 cases with shared \nresponsibility. \n \nDCF continues to further examine the process by which secondary assignments are generated, as \nwell as workflow management practices across Local Offices to ensure that intake workload is \nappropriately managed regardless of the combination of primary and secondary assignments.  \n \nThe Monitor remains concerned about the additional workload of these shared cases and will \ncontinue to track incidences of secondary assignments to Intake workers and conduct interviews \nwith workers to determine how significant the impact of a shared case is on an Intake worker’s \nworkload.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n153 CP&P Manual (4-7-2014).

The Monitor’s review of DCF data found that \noverall, two percent of investigations were assigned to non-caseload carrying staff between the \nmonths of January through June 2014.  DCF reports that its policy requires completion of First \nResponder training for all staff prior to intake assignment and that non-caseload carrying staff \nwho are assigned investigations have been trained and receive supervision by the Intake \nsupervisor as they carry out these investigations.  \n \nAs part of the interviews discussed above, Intake workers were asked if there were scenarios in \ntheir office in which non-caseload carrying staff could be assigned an investigation. Twenty-six \nof the 77 workers (34%) reported that there are scenarios in which this takes place.  Respondents \nstated that non-caseload carrying staff with prior investigations experience can be assigned cases \nwhen all Intake workers in a Local Office reach their assignment limit for the month.  This was \nthe most common scenario described.  The most frequently identified job titles for the non-\ncaseload carrying staff who are assigned investigations are Administrative Assistant and \nResource Development Specialist.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n154 Data are provided for investigations assigned within five days of intake receipt date and does not reflect \nadditional assignments to an investigation after those first five days. DCF conducted a review of assignments to non-\ncaseload carrying staff in NJ SPIRIT and found that some investigations had been re-assigned to caseload carrying \nworkers after the initial five days.  As a result, there is potential for the percentage of investigations assigned to non-\ncaseload carrying staff to be lower than 1%.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CP&P trained 85 workers \nduring this monitoring period, 40 of whom were hired in the previous monitoring period. Ten of \nthe 85 workers were trained through the Baccalaureate Child Welfare Education Program \n(BCWEP).157 \n \nThe Monitor verified that the state complied with the MSA (Section II.B.1.b) regarding Pre-\nservice training for workers.  \n \nCase Practice Model Training \n \nDCF continues to train its workforce on the Case Practice Model (CPM), which represents the \nfundamental change in practice in New Jersey.  At this stage in the implementation of the CPM, \nthe only staff who receive CPM training are staff who did not receive CPM training at an earlier \ndate because they were not yet on staff, were on leave when the training was conducted, or not \nyet appointed as supervisors in the case of Module 6, a training for supervisors discussed below. \n \nAs reflected in Table 35, between January and June 2014, the New Jersey Office of Training and \nProfessional Development (Training Academy) trained 81 staff on Module 1 of the CPM.  The \nTraining Academy also trained 99 staff on Module 2.  These are the first two training modules in \nthe six part series. \n \nModules 3 through 6 of the series take place on site in CP&P Local Offices and are conducted by \nthe New Jersey Child Welfare Training Partnership. 158 Between January and June 2014, 93 staff \nwere trained in Module 3, 59 were trained in Module 4 and 47 were trained in Module 5. A total \nof 16 staff were trained in Module 6.159  \n \nThe Monitor verified that staff took CPM training and passed relevant competency exams. \n \n   \n                                                 \n157 BCWEP is a consortium of seven New Jersey colleges (Rutgers University, Seton Hall University, Stockton \nCollege, Georgian Court University, Monmouth University, Kean University and Ramapo College) that enables \nstudents to earn a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree.

Christie – July 1, 2008 through \nDecember 31, 2008, Washington, D.C., pg. 34, the Monitor previously determined that this course of study together \nwith Worker Readiness Training designed by the DCF Child Welfare Training Academy satisfies the MSA \nrequirements. All BCWEP students are required to pass the same competency exams that non-BCWEP students take \nbefore they are permitted to carry a caseload. \n158 The New Jersey Child Welfare Training Partnership is a consortium of three New Jersey colleges and universities \n(Rutgers School of Social Work, Montclair State University Center for Child Advocacy and the Richard Stockton \nCollege of New Jersey) that DCF contracts with to provide In-service Training to CP&P staff.  \n159 Sixteen staff took Module 6 either as make-ups or because they were newly appointed supervisors.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Concurrent planning is the practice of simultaneously planning \nfor more than one permanency outcome for a child in care.  DCF incorporates concurrent \nplanning approaches into FTMs and other family conferences. \n \nAs reflected in Table 34, between January and June 2014, all 89 (100%) out of 89 new CP&P \nworkers were trained in concurrent planning and passed competency exams.  \n  \nThe Monitor verified that the state complied with the MSA (Section II.B.2.d) regarding \nconcurrent planning.  \n \nInvestigation (or First Responder) Training \n \nIn September 2013 First Responders training was expanded into three separate modules covering \nsix days of training.

ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH QUALITATIVE REVIEW AND THE \nPRODUCTION AND USE OF ACCURATE DATA  \n \nQUALITATIVE REVIEW \n \nDCF’s Office of Performance Management and Accountability continues to facilitate statewide \nQualitative Reviews (QRs), led by the Office of Quality.  During this monitoring period, DCF \nreviewed 120 cases from ten counties,161 typically reviewing 12 cases from each county.  The \nreviews focus on the status of children, the status of practice and the functioning of systems in \neach of the counties. For children under 18, the child’s legal guardian is asked to give informed \nconsent for participation in the QR.  Trained review teams of two persons that include DCF staff, \ncommunity stakeholders and Monitor staff review CP&P case records and interview as many \npeople as possible who are involved with the child and family.  Following the QR in each \ncounty, areas of accomplishment and challenges for the system are identified and discussed to \ninform continued case practice improvement. Selected QR results are also used to report on \nseveral MSA requirements and are included in this report.  \n \nTable 36 provides the gender and age of the 120 children reviewed between January and June \n2014. One third (30%) of the children were living with a parent at the time of the review; 70 \npercent of the children lived with a relative or non-relative resource parent. \n \nTable 36:  Qualitative Review Gender and Age Demographics \n(January – June 2014) \n \nGender  #  % \nMale   54  45% \nFemale  66  55% \nTotal  120  100% \nAge  #  % \n4 years or less  47  39% \n5-9 years  21  17% \n10-13 years  19  16% \n14 -17 years  13  11% \n18-21 years  20  17% \nTotal  120  100% \nSource:  DCF, QR Demographics January 2014 – June 2014 \n \n \nDCF reports that across the state, 1,223 people were interviewed to inform the QR data for this \nreporting period.

The QR scores regarding Family Functioning and \nResourcefulness and Progress towards Permanency, while improved, are lagging behind the \noverall status and remained essentially unchanged.  \n \nTable 37:  Qualitative Review Child and Family Status Results \n(January – June 2014) \n \n# Cases  # Cases \nChild & Family Status Indicators  % Acceptable \nApplicable  Acceptable \nSafety at Home  120  119  99% \nSafety in other Settings  120  118  98% \nStability at Home  120  93  78% \nStability in School  77  70  91% \nLiving Arrangement  120  115  96% \nFamily Functioning & Resourcefulness  117  85  73% \nProgress towards Permanency  120  69  58% \nPhysical Health of the Child  120  114  95% \nEmotional Well-Being  120  110  92% \nLearning & Development, Under  Age 5  45  40  89% \nLearning & Development, Age 5 & older  75  69  92% \nOVERALL Child & Family  Status  120  109  91% \n       Source:  DCF, QR results January 2014 – June 2014 \n \n \n                                                 \n162 Interviews are usually conducted individually, either by phone or in person. All efforts are made to see \nchildren/youth in the setting in which they reside. \n163 In previous monitoring reports, under the heading of acceptable, status was further described as either “optimal,”  \n“good,” or “fair.” Unacceptable status was further defined as either “marginal,” “poor,” or “worsening.” Beginning \nthe previous monitoring period, under the heading of acceptable, status was changed to be further described as either \n\"refine” or “maintain.” Unacceptable status was changed to be further described as either “refine” or “improve.” By \nagreement between the Monitor and CP&P, cases were considered acceptable if the QR ratings were within 4 – 6 \nand unacceptable if ratings were within 1 – 3. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Following the QR and based on results, each county develops a \nplan to focus on improving practice in particular areas. The statewide QR process has become a \nroutine part of quality improvement practice in New Jersey and QR data continue to be used to \ninform policy and practice changes. \nNJ SPIRIT \n  \nDCF continues to work to improve data entry, data quality and data reporting through NJ \nSPIRIT.  Additionally, DCF continues to fulfill the MSA requirement to produce agency \nperformance reports with a set of measures approved by the Monitor and post these reports on \nthe DCF website for public viewing (MSA II.J.6).165 \n \nNJ SPIRIT functionality was again enhanced during this monitoring period.  A new feature was \nadded to NJ SPIRIT that provided all supervisors the ability to search for and access an \nindividual staff member’s pending work.  Enhancements were also made to allow supervisors to \nreroute pieces of work from one worker to another when a worker is inactive.  Additionally, NJ \nSPIRIT allows for the extension of Medicaid coverage for qualifying young adults between the \nage of 18 and 26. Qualified candidates with existing DCF Medicaid in NJ SPIRIT are \nautomatically transferred to the new Federal Medicaid program in their 18th or 21st birthday \nmonth.  \n \nThe NJ SPIRIT Help Desk continues to support workers in resolving technical issues. Between \nJanuary and June 2014 the Help Desk closed 15,243 tickets requesting help or NJ SPIRIT IT \nsupport. The Help Desk resolved 7,317 (48%) of the 15,243 closed tickets within one work day \nand an additional 5,945 (39%) tickets within seven work days for a total of 87 percent resolved \nwithin seven work days.   \n \nSafeMeasures \n \nSafeMeasures continues to be used by DCF staff at all levels of the organization to help them \ntrack, monitor and analyze trends in case practice in their own local areas. SafeMeasures allows \nstaff to analyze data by Area Office, county, Local Office, unit supervisor and by case and also \nprovides the staff with quantitative data they can use to identify strengths and diagnose needs to \nimprove outcomes.  \n \nDuring this monitoring period, DCF rolled out an enhanced version of SafeMeasures. The new \nSafeMeasures v5 provides more functionality with customized views and menus to meet the \ncontinuing needs of users. Effective August 1, 2014, staff will use the new version exclusively.  \nDCF has seen a sustained usage of SafeMeasures by staff at all levels.  SafeMeasures is also used \nby executive management to track and monitor targeted outcomes. DCF continues to develop \nnew reports in SafeMeasures to help staff better manage caseloads and worker responsibilities.  \n                                                 \n165 See http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/childdata/  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET  \n \nThe approved FY 2015 state appropriation for the Department of Children and Families, \neffective July 1, 2014, totals $1,095,861,000 and the total budget including federal funds is \nslightly over $1.6 billion.  For the most part, the legislature accepted Governor Christie’s \nproposed budget which includes a slight increase from the 2014 budget (including amounts that \nhad been provided in 2014 supplemental funding).  There are relatively small increases and \nreductions in identified areas within the budget, mostly reflecting budget adjustments from prior \nyears due to utilization patterns.   For example, budgeted funds for foster care were increased by \n$314,000 based on the recent increases in the number of children in foster care.  The legislature \nalso increased funding for Domestic Violence Services, Sexual Assault Services and the Court \nAppointed Special Advocates (CASA) program.  DCF reports that the budget allows for 6,643 \nstaff positions which represents no change from FY 2014. DCF also reports that the FY 2015 \nbudget provide sufficient funds to carry out the state’s responsibilities for child protection, \nchildren’s mental health (CSOC), services to support children in their own homes and in out-of-\nhome placement and to achieve the MSA outcomes related to children’s safety, permanency and \nwell-being.  \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  January 2015 \nMonitoring Period XV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Additionally, the Coutt received a \nletter application dated February 12, 2003 from the Newark Morning Ledger Company, publisher \nor The Star-Ledger (\"The Ledger\"), a New Jersey newspaper, requesting permission to join the \nMotion to Intervene filed by The Times.1  Defendants Christine Todd Whitman'\\ as Governor of \nthe State of New .Jersey; Michde K. Guhl, as Commissioner of the Department of Human \nServices; Charles V .:nti, a~ Director or the Division of Youth and Family Services of the State of \nNew Jersey (\"Defendants\"), however, oppose the Motion and have filed a separate Motion for a \nProtective Order.'1  On February 14, 2003, the Court granted pem1ission to The Ledga to join the \nMotion to Intervene filed by The Times.  On March 3, 2003, the Court granted the The Times' \n1A  s per letlcr application by The !.edger, it will join in !he Motion to Intervene without !I ling separate \npapers and will rely on The Tim,•s' papers for purposes of simplicity pursuant to Local Civil Rule 1.1 (h).  (Robinson \nLetter dated February 12, 2003 at 1) . \n\"The current docket rcnects Christine Todd Whitman as tl1e Governor of New Jersey and while there has \nbeen no .substitution of her as a defendant, the present Governor of New Jersey is James E. McGreevey.  The parties \nhave, on their own, substituted the prior namc<.l defendants with the individuals currently occupying the positions oi' \nthe then Jofcndants.  However, the Court will use the names of the def\\mdants as it appears on the cun'tlnl docket. \n:~Defendants~ lirgumcnts Ln support of a Prokctive Order arc essentially the same as their arguments for \nopposing The Times' Motion to intervene.  Similarly, Plaintiffs' arguments in oppositi.on to Defendants' Motion for a \nProtective Order >tre the same, a.< they llled only one llricl\"as both in suppn11 of 'llle 'times' Motion and in opposition \nto LJefendants' Motion.  Therefore, the Court will address both Motions in this Opinion in the context of the Motion \nto Intervene. \n2 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 3 of 24 PageID: 969\n'·  ,.  1 \nMotion to Intervene and The Ledger's application for intervention for purposes of bei11g heard on \nissues relating to obtaining <tccess to Defendants' documents.4 \nThe Motion ofthe Interveners seck to permit public disclosure of certain records \nproduced in discovery by the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (\"DYFS\").  The \nMotion for a Protective Onlt'r, citing a variety of stale and federal statutes addressing \nconfidentiality ol\" such records and the agreed upon confidentiality order in place, seeks to \npreclude disclosure.  The Collt·t has reviewed the wri!len submissions of the parties and \nconducted oral argument on March 3, 2003 and March 14, 2003. \nFor the reasons that follow, the Motion of the Interveners to disclose Defendants' \ndocuments is granted in part and denied in part, and the Interveners will be provided limited \naccess to the DYFS records after certain reasonable limitations have been met. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn August 4, 1999, Plaintiffs, Charlie and Nadine H., siblings aged eleven and nine, who \nhave been in the custody and care of Division of Youth and Family Services for over l.ive years, \ncommenced this action by filing a 131  page, 409 paragraph Complaint.  In their Complaint, \nPlaintiffs named and discussed twenty other plaintil\"fs, who also have been or are still under the \ncustody and care of DYJ•S.  The Plaintiff Class has been ccrtiticd by the District Court and the \nclass representatives are: Jason, Jennifer, and Patti W., siblings aged ten, eight, and six who were \nremoved from their mother's custody three years ago; D•mnis M. And Denise R., siblings aged \neight and seven who were removed from their mother's custody in 1995; Marco and Juan C., \n4For case or discussion, the Court will refer to The Times and The Ledger as Interveners and their Motion \nand application for intervention as a MotlOtl for Intervention. \n3 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 4 of 24 PageID: 970\nsiblings aged eight and ten who were removed from their mother's (:are for the second time in \n1995; Dolores and Atma G., siblings aged four and seventeen months who have been in DYFS's \ncustody since August 1998; Kyle J ., age one-and-half who has been in roster care since birth; \nRyan, Chri~tophcr, and Melissa H., sibling~ who currently live with their mother despite \nnumerous reports of abuse and neglect; Ricky, Daniel, and Thomas M., siblings who currently \nlive with thdr mother, but have spent most their lives in DYFS custody; and Barry M., age \nseventeen who has been in and out ofDYFS custody since the age of four (\"Plaintiffs or Plaintiti \nClass\") as well as many others who, according to Plaintill's, continue to live under abusive and \nneglectful enviromnents.  Charlie Hand Nadine H  v.  Whitman,  83 F.Supp.2d 476, 480 (O.N.J. \n2000), \nPlaintill's describe the details ol'thc lives of other class members in DYFS'~ care to \nillu~tratc and allege a systemic failure on the part oflhe Defendants to protect the Plaintiffs fi·oJn \nharm and to provide their l'amilics with support and services in order to maintain adequate health \nand safely.  (Compl. ~ 27).  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege atid argue that the failure of the child \nwelfare system is a result of poor management ofDYFS.  (Campi. ~]28). Specifically, Plaintiffs \nallege that the overburdening of DYI'S causes high turnover rates of caseworkers who provide \ndirect services to the children in care.  (Com pl.~ 31 ).  In turn, the turnovers have resulted in gaps \nin providing services to the children in DYFS who eventually fall through the cracks.  Again, \nPlaintiffs' Complaint goes on to describe the effects of these gaps in heart-wrenching detail by \nproviding details of the abuses that the children have endured while in the custody oi'DYFS.  For \nexample, Pl;lintiffs allege sexual, physical and psychological abuses where in one instance, a \nplaintiff was nearly killed.  (See Compl. ~~ 84, 85, !OS,  127, 134, and 74).  Furthermore, \n4 \n\n. \n•  • \n. \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 5 of 24 PageID: 971\n'' \n' \nPlaintitfs allege the lack of medical services and other special needs that Defendants have failed \nto address.  (See Compl. ~'1]93, 105, 107, 122, 131-32, 139, and180).  As the District Court \nnoted, \"there is no other term than tragic to summarize the facts as alleged by Plaintiffs.\" \nCharlie H  and Nadine H, 83 F.Supp.2d at 480. \nMost recently, the tragic death of Faheem Williams and the abuse of his sibli11gs, who \nwere familiar to DYFS, have encouraged the Plaintirli:; and the Interveners to request a \nmodification ol\" the existing Confidentiality Order, which governs disclosure of discovery in this \nclass action.  Plaintiffs argue that in light of the ongoing institutional deficiencies, it is !heir hope \nthat informing the puhlic would place DYFS under public scrutiny and thereby encourage or \nfacilitate a overhaul of the child wellare system to improve the lives of the state's most \nvulnerable children.  T11e Interveners assert the public's right to know in support of their Motion \nand application tor modiiication of!he Confidentiality Order. \nPlaintiffs and the Interveners contend that the existing Conl1dentiality Order is too broad. \nSpecifically, the Interveners seek !o penni! disdosure of the following: (I) public disclosure of \nall discovery materials pertaining to child fatality and near fatality vases without redaction and \n(2) public disclosure of all discovery materials pertaining to living children subject to the \nredaction ofthe names or other identifying in linmalion pertaining to the children and their \nfamilies.  Moreover, the Interveners argue that Defendants have ~ burden or demonstrating that \nthere is good cause to maintain the current Confidentiality Order especially when it involves \nissues of great public concern as here. \nDefendants counter the Jnterveners by slating that disclosure of such sensitive and \nconfidential information will compromise the anonymous reporting of abuse or neglect and \n5 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 6 of 24 PageID: 972\nimpact the privacy of the children and ramilies involved with DYFS.  Defendants argue that the \ninfc>rmation sought by the Plaintiffs and Jntcrveners will only further sensationalize the tragic \ndeath of Faheem Williams rather than to inform the public and lead to meaningful compromise in \nthe current system.  The Interveners reply that it is precisely these potential failures that the \npublic is concerned about and has a right to know before another tragic death occurs.  The \nInterveners argue that the modification they seek will not jeopardize the privacy interests of the \nchildren and fiunilies involved in DYFS but balances those interests and the interests of the \npublic's right to the information.  Finally, Defendants argue that the infbrmation sought by the \nJntervencrs is protected by New Jersey statutes and therefore, simply cannot be compromised \nunless it is for research purposes of individuals involwd in academia or proCessionals it1 the child \nwelfare system. \nTT.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Motion to Intervene \n1.  Standing to Intervene \nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \"third parties have standing to challenge \nprotective orders and confidentiality orders in an effort to obtain access to information or judicial \nproceedings.\"  Pam:y v.  Borough ofStroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1994) (footnote \nomitted).  The Third Circuit has explained that third parties have standing to intervene even \nthough \"they assert rights that 111ay belong to a broad portion of the public at large.

Permissive Intervention \nPursuant to Federal Rule oi'Civil Procedure 24, a person or an entity, who is not a named \nparty in an action, may intervene in lhc interested litigation by serving a motion as provided in \nFederal Rule oi'Civil Procedure 5.  See FED. R. CJV. P. 24(c).  Intervention of right is \ninapplicable here as no statutes confer such a right nor do the Interveners have any requisite \ninterest in the subject oflhe litigation as required by Rule 24(a).  FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a). \nAccordingly, the Court will discuss whether The Timrts' and The [,edger's application~ for \nintervention satisfies the requirement~ of FED. R. Ctv. P. 24(b) which allows permissive \nintervention by an applicant.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) provides in relevant part: \n[u]pon timely application anyone may be permilled to intervene in \nan action ... when an applicant's claim or defense and the main \naction have a question o!'law or fact in common ....

Clearly, The Times and The Ledger have timely filed a Motion to Intervene in the \npresent matter as it relates to the tragic death ofFaheem Williams which sparked further public \ninterest in the welta.re ofNew Jersey's most vulnerable children.  Additionally, in balancing the \npublic's interest to know the status of the children under DYFS' care with any prejudice and \nundue delay The Times' and The LtJdger 's intervention may cause to the parties here, the Court is \nsatislied that there will be minimal, if any prejudice or undue delay as a result of their \nintervention. \nIn addition to liling a timely application for intervention, the Court must consider whether \nThe Times and The Ledger, who arc not parties to the litigation, have a claim or defense that has \na common question of law or fact as the main action.  As publications, The Times' and The \n!.edger's interests arc to disseminate news to the public and they do not have any claim or \n8 \n\n•  • \n.  .C ase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 9 of 24 PageID: 975\n''  .. \ndefense that has a common question of law or fact as the present action between Charlie II. <!11d \nDYFS.  However, as the Third Circuit has interpreted it, Rule 24(b)'s requirement that an \napplicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common may \nhe satisfied if its intervention is for the purpose of challenging a confidentiality or protective \norder.  Here, 1'he Times and The Ledger seek to intervene to do just that, to challenge the existing \nconfidentiality order and to modify it  Essentially, The Times' and The LedJJer 's purpose for \nintervention is to gain greater access to Defendants' case records, and to provide the public with \na more comprehensive view of DYFS, and specifically, the children in its care.  As such, The \nTimes and The Ledger satisfy the Third Circuit's interpretation of Rule 24(h)'s requirement that a \n\"question of law or !act in common\" with the main action is not necessary when the applicant is \nnot an original party to the action and is seeking to challenge the confidentiality order. \nB.  Confidentiality Orders \n1.  Good Cause Analysis \nDistrict Conrts retain the power to modifY or vacate con lldentiality orders that it has \nentered.  See Pansy, 23 F.3d at 7H4-H5, and cases cited therein.  The l'an1y Court explained that \nwhen a party seeks to modify an order of confidentiality, the party \"must come liJrward with a \nreason to modifY the order.\"  See id. at 790.  Once the Court is satist1cd that a reason exists to \nmodify the order, the District Court must then \"use the same balancing test that is used in \ndetermining whether to grant such orders in the first instance, with one ditierence: one of the \nfactors the court should consider in determining whether to modifY the order is the reliance by \nthe original parties on the confidentiality order.\"  Td.  However, the Pansy Court made clear that \nor \nthe original parties' reliance on the protective order or order  confidentiality, is not outcome \n9 \n\n•  • \n.  Case 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 10 of 24 PageID: 976\n,·  r  • \n.,  ' \ndeterminative, but simply, one ol'thc factors the Court is to consider in making its modification \ndetermination.  !d. \nAlso, the burden of showing good cause rests with the party seeking continued \nconfidentiality when the confidentiality order sough! to be modified is an ''umbrella\" \nconfidentiality order.  See Cipollone v.  Uggett Group, Inc., 785 P.2d 1108, 1122 (3d Cir. 1986), \ncert. denied, 484 U.S. 976 (1987).  The Third Circuit explained that \n[ijt is corred that the burden of'justifying the confidentiality of \neach and every document so~tght to b<: covered by a protective \nordef remains on the party seeking the protective order; any other \nconclusion would turn Rule 26(c) on its head.  That do<lS not mean, \nhowever, that the party seeking the protective order must \nnecessarily demonstrate to the court in the tirst instance on a \ndocument-by-document basis that each item should be protected. \nII' is equally consistent with the proper allocation of evidentiary \nburdens for the court to construct a broad ''umbrella\" protective \norder upon a threshold showing by one party (the movant) of good \ncause.  Under this approach, the umbrella order would initially \nprotect all documents that the producing party designated in good \nfaith as confidential.  After the documents fare] delivered ~mdcr \nthis ~tmbrella order, the opposing party could indicated precisely \nwhich documents it believed to be not confidential, and the movant \nwould have the burden of proof of justifying the protective order \nwith respect to those documents. \n!d.; see also Pansy, 23 F.3d at 787 n.l7.  In this case, under the tenns of the Confidentiality \nOrder, parties are allowed access to the DYFS case reeords and may disc.Jose them only to parties \ndesignated under paragraph five of the Order.  (Interim Con11dcntialily Order a11d Stipulation~ \n5).  Furthermore, should Plaintiffs wish to disclose any confidential materials to outside parties, \nthey were to provide written notice to Defendants.  (!d. ,\\7).  In addition, if the parties disagreed \n5 A~ the 'l'hird Circuit ~tatedt Hf pJ rotcctive orders atld orders of eonfidentiality are functionally s·irnllar, and \nrequire similar balancing ... and good cause must be demonstrated to justify the order.\"  Pansy, 23 F.3d at 7R6. \n10 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 11 of 24 PageID: 977\n.. \n.. \nregarding the disclosure, Del\\mdants would have the option of seeking a protective order !'rom \nthe Court within eight days of Plaintiffs' written notice to disclo~e. (!d.). \nAs the final paragraph of the Interim Confidentiality Order and Stipulation states, parties \nnegotiated in good i:1ith but \"failed to reach an agreement as to the form of a protective order\" \nand as a result, Plaintiffs stipulated to the terms of the Order to quickly obtain case records.  (!d. \n\"if  11 ).  Moreover, Plainti !'Is stipulated to the terms with a provision regarding possible future \nmodification of the Order (!d.) <md shortly thereafter Jlled a Motion for modification on May 19, \n2000.  At that time, the District Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion stating that \"pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 26, good cause exists for a protective order in this mater to 'protect a \nparty or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or cxpenset.l'\" \n(Order filed July 21, 2000).  Once again, the burden is upon the party seeking to maintain the \nConfidentiality Order, in this instance, Defendants, to demonstrate why infonnation sought \nshould remain confidential. \nThe Third Circuit in Glenmede Trust Co.  v.  Thompson summarized the Pansy factors to \nbe weighed in making a good cause determination as follows: \nI) whether disclosure will violate any privacy interests; \n2) whether the information is being sought for a legitimate purpose \nor for an improper purpose; \n3) whether disclosure of the inl(>mmtion will cause a party \nembarrassment; \n4) whether confidentiality is being sought over information \nimportant to public health and safety; \n5) whether the sharing or information among litigants will promote \nfaimess and efficiency; \n6) whether a party benefitting from the order of conlidentiality is a \npublic entity or official; and \n7) whether the case involves issues important to the public. \nII \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 12 of 24 PageID: 978\nt  t  >  I  • \n56 F.3d 476, 483 (3d Cir. 1995) (citing and summarizing Pamy, 23 F.3d at 787-91 ).  As noted \nabovt!, in addition to these l'actors, which the Third Circuit has made clear are neither \"mandatory \nnor exhaustive,\" see id, the court must weigh the original parties' reliance on the order of \nconfidentiality to determine whether good cause still exists. \nIn its Pansy analysis, the Interveners contend that when privacy interests of the concerned \nparties are balanced against the benefits of public disclosure, there arc mechanisms provided by \nRule 26(c) that will favor disclosure.  (The Times' Br. at 14).  For example, the Interveners argue \nthat redacting the identifYing information from the case records will be one way to protect the \nprivacy interest but at the same time allow public disclosure.  (!d).  More importantly, the \nInterveners argue that when public entities are involved, such as here, the balance tips in the \npublic favor for obtaining access to the practices and policies of agencies like DYFS.  (!d. at 15· \n16).  Furthermore, Intervener~ argue that public's acce~s to the information they seek arc \nimportant to the health and safely of the children, and to the public that DYfS serve~. (/d. at 16). \nAdditionally, the Interveners argue that this case deals with matters that directly affect public \npolicy which tip~ the balance in tl1e public's favor to gain access to the internal workings of \nDYFS and the children and the families they serve.  (ld). \nOn the contrary, the Defendants argue that New Jersey law does not recognize a public's \nright to kl1ow when it involves children under the care of DYFS.  (Defs.['] Mot. for a Protective \nOrder at 6).  In this vain, the Defendants contend that New Jersey statutes allow disclosure of \nDYFS information only to specified individuals, specifically, professionals who are conducting \nresearch in the field or police onlcers investigating a child abuse or neglect.  (/d.) (citing NJ.S.A. \n12 \n\n• \n• \n''  .  Case 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 13 of 24 PageID: 979\n9:6-8.1 O(an.  Similarly, Defendants argue that the New Jersey Administrative Code bars \n'\"informitig the public regarding DYFS deficiencies leading to abuse and neglect of children in \nfi>ster care[.]'\" (Jd. at 8).  In addition to the statutes that Defendants cite as reasons why this \nCourt should not provido: access to the public of DYFS case records, they arguo: throughout their \nBrief in Opposition for Modi llcation ol' the Conl!dcntialily Order and in their Brief in support of \ntheir Motion Cor a Protective Order that they, nor do the Plaintiffs, have a legitimate purpose for \nreleasing such confidential information to the public.  (See Dcfs.['] Opp'n Br.; see also Defs.l' I \nMot. for a Protective Order).  Therelbre, the Defendants argue that under the law of New Jersey, \nthe proposed information that Interveners seck to release to the public is illegal and the \nlntctveners should be prevented from doing so in the interest of justice. \nAs an initial matter, the Court finds that the Interveners have met its burden of showing \nthat a sut1icient reason exists to modifY the existing Conlldentiality Order and Stipulation in light \nof the uniquely tragic death or Faheem Williams and the horrendous abuse of his surviving \nsiblings.  The Comt finds that the lntcrveners' need for DYFS' case records in order to make a \ncomprehensive report to the public of the status of certain children currently under DYFS' care \nconstitutes a sufficient reason lo modify the Confidentiality Order and Stipulation, given \nreasonable limitations.  Therefore, the Court will conduct a balancing of the respective interests \nand the Pansy factors. \nJt is clear that the iavolvement of a public entity in the litigation is a factor weighing \ngreatly in lavor of disclosure.  The Pansy Court stated that \n6Thc various N..J.S.A. statutes that the Detendants cite as authority for why case records should remain \nconrldontial and protected are mentioned later in the Opinion.  See lf!fi·a n. 7, p, 17. \n13 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 14 of 24 PageID: 980\n'' \nIt is appropriate for courts to order COillldcntiality to prevent the \ninfliction ol' unnecessary or seriou~ pain on parties who the court \nreasonably finds are entitled 10 such protection.  In this vein, a \nIa ctor to consider is whether the information is being sought for a \nlegitimate purpo~e or for an improper purpose.  However, privacy \ninterests are diminished when the party seeking protection is a \npublic per~on subject to kgitimatc public sCnltiny.  Cf United \nStates v.  Smith, 776 F.2d ll 04, 1114 (3d Cir. 1985) (\"[T)he public \nhas a substantial interest in the integrity or lack of integrity or those \nwho serve them in public omcc.'') \nPan.~v. 23 F.3d at 787 (footnote omitted). \nIlere, Defendants arc clearly public entities and ptlblic figures and specifically, DYFS is \nan entity established by the govemmcnt to provide public services to abused and neglected \nchildren.  DYFS is controlled by the Slate in all aspects.  Accordingly, the Court finds that \nDYFS' privacy interests arc diminished and certain information is subject to disclosure. \nFurlhennorc, the Court is awtely aware that the subjects of the DYFS' case records are children, \nand indeed, New Jersey'~ most V1linerable children.  The Court in no way wants to subject these \nchildren to more pain or embarrassment than they may have already suffered.  However, the \nCourt finds thallhe Interveners seek DYFS case records for a legitimate purpose, and not as the \nDefendants contend to compromise their confidential reporting system as well as the privacy \ninterests of the parties involved.  In order i()r the Interveners to thoroughly investigate and report \ncomprehensively to the public, it is imperative that the Interveners obtain as much relevant \ninl(mnation as possible.  In this regard, certain discreet inlhrmation in DYFS case records is \ndearly relevant. \nDefendants rc!y on the Third Circuit's decision in !'ear son v.  Miller and that it is \ncompelling authority f()l' granting their reque~l l'or a protective order.  Pearson v.  Miller, 211 \n14 \n\n•  • \n''..

Tn Pearson v. \nMiller, th~ Court did recognize the compelling interest of the stale in maintaining the various \nagency records confidential.  However, that interest was diminished when Defendant Bruce \nMiller waived his right to confidentiality by signing an authorization for release of infonmt!ion. \nJd at 61.  More impo1tantly, the Third Cin.•uit in Pearson stated that \"a federal court 'may sec fit \nfor special reasons !o give the law of a particular state highly persuasive or even controlling \neffect, but in the last analysis its decision turns upon the law of the United States, no! that of any \nstate.\"' P~arson, 211  F.3d at 67 (quoting D 'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447, 471, \nS.Ct. 616, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942)) (emphasis omitted). \nThus, the Court finds that the Defendants need to do more than assert non-binding state \nconfidentiality statutes to support their contention that release of case records may compromise \nthe privacy interests.  As the Third Circuit has repeatedly stated, ''' [h ]road allegations of harm, \nunsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning,,' do not support a good cause \nshowing.\" Pansy, 23 F. 3d at 786 (quoting, Cipollone, 7R5 F.2d at 1121).  The Court in Pansy \nalso held that \"good cause is established on a showing that disclosure will work a clearly defined \nand serious injury to the party seeking closure.  The injury must he shown with specificity.\"  !d. \n(quoting Publicker indus., inc. v. Cohen, 733 F.2d 1059, 1071 (3d Cir. 1984)).  Good cause \ncannot ordinarily be demonstrated on this basis of some speculative harm.  See Fanelli v. \nCentenm:y College, 211 F.R.D. 268,270 (D.NJ. 2002).  Finally, litigants should always be \nmindful that good cause is a fluid consideration.  For example, good cause for non-disclosure of \ncertain infonnation may be demonstrated at the early discovery stage of a case but may not later \nbe able to be justified d~tring the course of a public trial. \n15 \n\n•  • \n. \n:'  Case 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 16 of 24 PageID: 982\n..  1  ,: \n• \nln addition, the Court n~eds to consider whether the case involves issues important to the \npublic.  See Pansy, 23 F.3d at 788.  \"If a [confidentiality ordcrl involves issues or parties of a \npublic nature, and involves matters of legitimate public concem, that should be a factor weighing \nagainst entering or maintaining an order of conlldentiality.\"  !d.  The Court agrees with the \nInterveners and Plaintiffs that this issue is of great public interest, impacting on the health and \nsafety concerns of the children not only under the care of DYFS but others who may one day \ncome into contact with DYFS.  The only way for the public to know of the state of allairs of our \nchild weliarc system is to have reasonable access to care records that chronicle both DYFS' \ndellcicneies and improvements, its '\"defeats\" as well as its \"victori<Js.\"  Furthermore, it is \nimportant that governmental cntiti~s be held accountable for their actions tiot only to prevent \nl\"urthcr tragedies like the case of Faheem Williams, but to answer to its citizenry, whose \ntaxpaying dollar~ support DYFS.  Of course, attempts to ensure this accountability have nation \nwide application and should not be limited by ru1y fair analysis to New Jersey's child wellarc \nsystem. \nNext, the Court must consider the original parties' reliru1ce on the Confidentiality Order \nand Stipulation.  '\"The extent to which a party can rely on a [contidentiality order] should \ndepend on the extent to which the order induced the party to allow discovery or to settle the \ncase.\"' l'cmsy, 23 F.3d at 790 (quoting &c:kman, 966 F.2d at 475-76).  Defendants argue that \nthey relied in good faith ofthe Cotifidcntiality Order to protect its case records from disclosure. \nClearly, as a public agency, Defendants must have hecn aware that, at some point, they may be \nrequired to provide public access to its records produced dming discovery, given a legitimate \nreason to do so. \n16 \n\n•  • \n. ; f  Case 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 17 of 24 PageID: 983\nFinally, the Pansy Court held that \"where it is likely that infom1ation is accessible under a \nrelevant freedqm of infonnution law, a strong presumption exists against granting or maintaining \nan order of contidentiality whose scope would prevent disclosure of that infom1ation pursuant to \nthe relevant freedom ol' information law.\"  Pansy, 23 P.3d at 791.  Defendants contend that this \nfactor weighs against modi(ying the confidentiality order because Ullder various New Jersey \nstatutes7, it is the stale's mandate that the DYFS case records he kept confidential and not be \nmade public unless it is for research purposes by professionals in the field.  The Court agrees that \nthe DYFS case records are not \"pubic records.\"  However, the Court in Glenm~d~ made it clear \nthat the Pat1sy factors are neither ''mandatory nor exhaustive\" 56 F.3d at 483, and in view of the \nCourt's other findings in this Opinion, this particular Pamy factor is no! determinative. \n2.  The Current Confidentiality Order \nTlw Interim Confidentiality Order and Stipulation was filed on May 11, 2000 and broadly \nprotected DYFS' case records from disclosure.'  Subsequently, the Court filed a Confidentiality \n7Dcfcndants cite New Jersey Statutes Annotated (\"N.J.S.A.\") 9:6-S.lO(a); New Jersey Administrative Code \n(N.J.A.C.) I 0:1330-2.1 as authority for mandating confidentiality of its case records and not recognizing a public's \nright to know.  (Dds.['] Opp'n. Rr. at 7).  Furthermore, Defendants argue that \"[t]he proper course of ami on for [the \nInterveners] would have been to file a request for the inl(>mlation [they] seek[] pursuant to the state's Open Public \nRecords Act (\"OPRA\")\" under N.J.S.A. 47: lA· I .• et seq. .

However. since oral argument on March 3, 2003, the \nInterveners have modified their request to the following: \"(1) all Child Death Reports; (2) all \nCriticallncident Reports; (3) other documents, including intra-agency memoranda, reviewing \nDYFS actions in [Child Death and Critical Incident ReportsJ; (4) any underlying case files \ninvolving children in DYFS custody or lormerly in DYFS custody that would be considered \ndeath or near-death cases under the statute.''  (The Times' Supplemental Submission dated March \n6, 2003 at 3).  Subsequent to its March 6, 2003 Supplemental Submission and during oral \nargument on March 14, 2003, the Interveners have further pared down their request of \ndocuments.  At this junc!ure, the Interveners are requesting only a small review of the lollowing \ntypes of case files Jhm1 DYFS: ( 1) Child Death Reports; (2) Critieallncident Reports; (3) \nInstitutional Abuse Investigation Unit (\"!AlU\") Reports. \nlt is the Interveners' contention that a modification of the existing Order will assist in \ntheir endeavor to enlighten the public as to the current status of D\\'FS.  Moreover, the \nInterveners argue that such a modification will identifY other children who may he at risk under \nDYFS' care.  On the other hand, Defendants argue that the provisions of the Confidentiality \nOrder are necessary to preserve the integrity of its abuse and neglect reporting system and the \nprivacy interests of children, parents, and foster parents.  Specifically, Defendants vehemently \ncontend that all ol' the current provisions of the Confidentiality Order arc necessary to protect the \nidentities of the reporting parties, the children and their biological and fbster families who may \nbe involved.  Furthermore, Defendants argue that the request by the Interveners is \"extremely \nbroad\" and would thus jeopardize many individuals involved with DYFS f~,r no apparent \n19 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 20 of 24 PageID: 986\n.

If modified as originally requested, the \nConfidentiality Order would permit all records of all children in DYFS' care (i.e., by definition, \nchildren in DYFS are abused or neglected).  As The Times discussed in its Supplemental \nSubmi~sion and during oral argument on March 14, 2003, it has substantially reduced its list of \nrequested documents once again.  Speci lically, it has modified its request of all of the \nInstitutional Abust:l Investigation Unit (\"IAHJ\") Reports whether the investigation has been \n\"substantiated10,\"''unsubst<mtiated 11 ,\" and \"unfounded12'' to only those cases where it has been \n\"substantiated or unsubstantiated.\"  (The Times' Supplemental Submission dated March 6, 2003 \nat 3; Oral Argument on March 14, 2003).  Lastly, the Interveners argue that they will only be \nreviewing approximately ten percent of the 1300 Lt\\IU Jiles that are cun-ently available.  (!d.). \nDefendants, on the other hand, argue that the Critical Incident Reports, Child Death \nReports, and IAIU Reports should not be released pursuant to Pansy.  (Dcfs.['] Response to The \n9The Interveners requested the entire case records of thousands of children currently under the care of \nUYFS.  Specilkally, they requested the following: public disclosure of all discovery matel'ials pertaining to living \nchildren subject to the redaction oftl1e names or other identifying information pertaining to the children and their \nfamilies. \n\")According to the SUPPORT OI'HRATIONS MANUAl, written by DYFS, a case is categoriud as \n\"substantiated\" upon a preponderance of evidence >upporting a f1nding of abuse or neglect.

Aside From the potential violation \nof the children's privacy interests, and the loss of anonymity by other pa1ties involved in a child's \ncase, there are also practical considerations of such a production that the Court should weigh in \ndeciding whether to release the reports to the Intcrveners.13  (ld at 4).  Lastly, Defendants argue \nthat the Court consider the parties' reliance on the Confidentiality Order at issue as the Court in \nPan.~y reviewed.  Defi:ndants argue that they produced th<J documents in good faith relying on the \nfact that their sensitive case records would be protected ±rom disclosure.  (!d.). \nWhile the Court empathizes with the Defendants' reliance on an Order agreed to by the \npmties to the litigation, public entities should be sensitive to the reality that events often change \ncircumstances.  Moreover, the Court does not need read Pan,sy as requiring wholesale disclosure \nor sensitive case records during the course of a court proceeding.  On th<l other hand, the Court \nagrees with Plaintiffs and Interveners that the current Confidentiality Order is overly broad and \nshould be modi tied lhr the public to have access to certain DYFS' case records. \nAlthough the Court will limit the broad scope of the current Confidentiality Order, it is, \nnevertheless, mindful that confidentiality provisions established by the Slate of New Jersey have \na very clear purpose • to protect vulnerable children, to encourage persons with knowledge ofthe \nabuse or neglect of children to report such abuse or neglect, and to invite families to openly \ncommunicate with professionals to seek the assistance they need.  However, the Court must \nbalance those interest~ with the interest of a broader group of people, the public at large, who \nhave a right to know what is happening in its public agencies.  Accordingly, the Court believes \n13 According to the Defendants, the number oi'rcquests for JAIU Reports, though pared down by The Times \nis still quite voluminous and will he an arduous task to redael as each IAIU Report is at least 100 page'  (Defs.['l \nResponse to The Timd Supplemental Submission dated March 13, 2003 at 3-4). \n21 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 22 of 24 PageID: 988\nt.  +  ,I \nthat limited information regarding th<! status of the children under DYFS' care should be subject \nto disclosure to the public. \n3.  Modification of the Current Confidentiality Order \nor \nThe Court agrees with the parties that identifying information  children currently in \ncustody of DYfS and certain other family members is within the scope of the Confidentiality \nOrder am! thus such identifying information cannot be disclosed.  In addition, however, the Court \nwill now modi JY the Confidentiality Order to permit limited disclosure !'or the Interveners to gain \naccess to certain discovery already disclosed to the Plaintiffs: (I) all Child Death Reports and \nCritical Incident Reports, including attachments and documents contained within the reports and \n(2) all reports by the DYFS Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit where the IAIU findings were \n\"substantiated\" upon investigation, including any attachments and docum~nts within the reports. \nAny identifying information as specified in the attached Order (agreed to by all parties after \ndiscussion with the Court) will be redacted prior to dissemination. \n4.  Reasonable Limitations \nThe Court has identified documents that may he released upon redaction.  Courts also \nhave the discretion to impose n:asonahle limitations upon the process and the manner in which \nthese documents are to be reviewed, redacted, exchanged, and disclosed.  The Court in Pearson \nacknowledged the right to exercise discretion witl1in reasonable limitations pursuant to Federal \nRule of Ci vii Procedure 26(c) to release highly sensitive inlbnnalion.  Pearson, 211 F .3d at 72. \nAs the Pearson Court noted, \"[l]egitimate interests in privacy are among the proper subjects of \n[Rule 26(c)'sJ protection.\"  Jd.  Here, the Court recognizes the need for protecting the privacy \ninterests of' the children under the care of DYPS.  Furthermore, the Court finds that the \n22 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 23 of 24 PageID: 989\nDefendants have demonstrated good cause for limited protection of their case records.  Thus, in \nan cffmt to strike that balance between protecting the privacy interests with the publie's right to \nknow, the Court will require that the release of documents subject to this Opinion take place in \nthree phases a~ permitted by Rule 26(c).  FED. R. CIY. P. 26(c). \nDuring phase one, all Counsel shall be permitted to inspect the above referenced \ndocuments on an \"attorneys eyes only\" basis in the first instance.  ln phase two, Defendants will \nbe permitted to redact identifying references in the restricted discovery as embodied within the \naccompanying Order.  The redaction ol\"the tlrst 2000 pages shall be completed within len (10) \ndays of receiving a list of requested documents from Interveners' Counsel.  The time period may \nor \nhe enlarged by agreement  counsel or by further Order of the Court.  Finally, in phase three, the \nor \nattorneys will notify the Court in writing  any dispute that they haw been unable to resolve. \nAny failure to notify lh~ Court of such a dispute will be deemed a waiver of the party's rights. \nPublic disclosure of these speci lied documents will follow. \nIll.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, the Interveners' Motion for an Order modifying the current \nConlldentiality Order is granted in part and denied in part.  The Defendants' Cross Motion for a \nProtective Order, l'nr similar reasons, is granted in part and denied in part.  Specifically, \ndocuments related to (1) \"Death Reports,\" (2) \"Critical Incident Reports,\" and (3) \"substantiated \nreports\" in abuse cases, with identifying infornmtion redacted, will all be subject to disclosure to \nthe public.  The Tnlervt:lners' Motion in so far as it seeks other DYFS information is denied, in all \nn:spects, except that the Interveners and Plaintiffs may move to permit disclosure of a relevant \nsub-set of\"unsubstantialed reports.\"  The Court will also require reasonable limitations on such \n23 \n\n.  •  • \n··\". \nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 175   Filed 03/20/03   Page 24 of 24 PageID: 990\n'~ ~ ... ·,  .. \n,.,-. \ndisclosure by establishing a three step ':failsaj~\" process to insure that all identifying \ninlbrmation, or other specilic inform11tion harmful to DYFS children or families, will be \nredacted. \nOrdinarily, there i~ every good reason to ~bicld records of vulnerable children in foster \ncare.

The ultimate basis for the Court's decision is two-fold- a concern that \nwe all share- the safety and wdlarc of our children- and the Court's belief that letting in some \nreasonable sunlight on the way government works will serve tll protect the~e children by \nproviding the resources necessary to accomplish that goaL \nAn appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion. \nIf~  aocJ \nC'IO \nDated:  I \n24 ",

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed in July 2006 by the Honorable \nStanley R. Chesler of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey as Federal \nMonitor of the class action lawsuit Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie. As Monitor, CSSP is \ncharged with independently assessing New Jersey’s compliance with the goals, principles and \noutcomes of the original Court Order and the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA)1 aimed at \nimproving the state’s child welfare system. The MSA was structured in two phases: Phase I \nfocused on building infrastructure and standardizing caseloads, and Phase II focused on quality \ncase practice and outcome measures.  \n   \nOn November 4, 2015, the court approved a new Sustainability and Exit Plan (SEP)2 that \nsupersedes the MSA, attached as Appendix B. The SEP, which is the product of a year of \nproductive negotiations between the parties, intentionally recognizes and accounts for the \nsignificant progress the state has made since the lawsuit began, while at the same time mandates \na continued focus on those areas where additional improvements are needed.   \n \nThis is the first monitoring report measuring progress under the SEP and includes performance \ndata for the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.3 Under both the MSA and the \nSEP, the Monitor is to issue a report every six months on the state’s performance in meeting the \nagreed upon performance measures. However, by agreement of the parties, this report – because \nit covers the period during which the parties were in negotiations on the SEP – covers \nperformance from January to December 2015 or calendar year 2015 (CY 2015). The next \nmonitoring report will resume reporting on six month intervals and will cover the state’s progress \nfrom January 1 to June 30, 2016.  \n \nThe SEP includes three enforceable categories of requirements. All the requirements are to be \nguided by the same important principles that guided the original Court Order and the MSA:  \n \n  Foundational Elements: The SEP includes as Foundational Elements many of the MSA’s \nPhase 1 accomplishments, particularly those related to DCF’s infrastructure and \npreserves and solidifies the state’s commitment to maintain these as Foundational \nElements of a high quality child welfare system. These Foundational Elements, including \nsuch things as maintaining a high quality training program for staff and a functional \nmanagement information system (NJ SPIRIT), remain enforceable in the unanticipated \nevent that the state fails to maintain them. The Foundational Elements are described in \nfurther detail and included within Section IV of this report. \n \n  Outcomes To Be Maintained: This category includes all requirements in the SEP for \nwhich the state has satisfied the outcomes and specified performance targets for at least \nthe most recent six-month period. The state is expected to maintain these performance \nlevels as verified by the Monitor. The SEP establishes criteria for modest fluctuation and \n                                                 \n1 To see the full Agreement, go to:http://nj.gov/dcf/documents/home/Modified_Settlement_Agreement_7_17_06.pdf \n2 To see the full SEP, go to: http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/welfare/Sustainability-and-Exit-Plan-110415.pdf  \n3 Copies of all Monitoring Reports can be found at: http://www.cssp.org/publications/child-welfare  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As additional \nmeasures currently designated as To Be Achieved are met, they will be re-designated as \nTo Be Maintained. There are currently 12 performance measures in the To Be Maintained \ncategory. Outcomes To Be Maintained are described in further detail and included within \nSection V of this report. \n \n  Outcomes To Be Achieved: This category includes all items for which DCF has not yet \nmet the required level of performance. There are currently 36 performance measures in \nthe To Be Achieved category. If, at the conclusion of any six month monitoring period the \nMonitor determines that the state has satisfied a performance measure in this category, \nthe Monitor will designate the measure To Be Maintained; if the Monitor determines the \nstate has not satisfied the performance measure, it will continue as To Be Achieved. \nOutcomes To Be Maintained are described in further detail and included within Section V \nof this report.  \n \nThe SEP also modified some MSA outcomes and performance measures, reflecting the parties’ \nunderstanding and agreement that some of the MSA’s original targets were either not feasible, \ncreated negative, unintended consequences, or failed to reflect what is now considered child \nwelfare best practice. For example, staff and stakeholders consistently reported that there are \ncircumstances where workers need additional time to gather pertinent information in determining \ninvestigative findings (e.g., investigations involving the prosecutor’s offices and sexual abuse \ncases). In those cases, adhering to a 60-day closure timeframe could compromise the quality of \nthe investigation. Parties therefore agreed to modify the target and methodology to support best \npractice; the modifications provide a mechanism to include investigations that have documented, \nacceptable extension requests to complete investigations beyond the 60-day timeframe as \ncompliant. DCF’s Division of Child Protection and Permanency (CP&P) policy4 outlines \nacceptable reasons for extension requests and the supervisory approval process.  \n \nRefinements were also made in several SEP performance measures related to permanency \ntimeliness and outcomes. The SEP continues to include both process as well as outcome \nmeasures and performance standards related to the quality of case practice and the MSA’s \ncaseload measures.  \n \nThe Monitor’s access to data and its responsibilities to confirm and verify data reports and \nstatistics provided by the state remain unchanged under the SEP. Subsequent to the current \nmonitoring period that covers the full CY 2015, the Monitor will continue to produce reports for \nthe court and the public based upon six month monitoring periods. In order to build capacity \nwithin DCF, the Monitor will look first to the state’s data for analysis, but retains the authority to \nengage in independent data collection and analysis where needed. The state has committed to \nexpanding the data that it publishes on its public website.5  \n \n \n                                                 \n4 CP&P Policy Manual 5-28-2013, Intake Investigation and Response, II.C.5.125 \n5 To see DCP&P public website, go to: http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/ \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The ultimate authority for those designations remain \nwith the Monitor after consideration of evidence. The SEP also establishes a process for \naddressing non-compliance with enforceable provisions of the SEP that requires the parties to \nnegotiate in good faith to design and implement corrective action before resorting to litigation.  \n \nFinally, the SEP creates a clear path toward exiting the lawsuit based on the state demonstrating \nthat it has achieved compliance with all provisions of the SEP and sustained performance for a \ncontinuous period of at least 12 months.  \n                                                 \n13 To see the New Jersey Youth Resource Spot, go to: http://www.njyrs.org/  \n14 To see the CP&P Needs Assessment, go to: \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/childdata/protection/DCF.Needs.Assessment.Interim.Report_3.16.pdf  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

For this report, the Monitor was involved in the following additional verification \nactivities: \n   \n  Caseload Data Verification \n \nThe Monitor conducted a telephone survey of 257 workers to verify their individual \ncaseloads during the periods of January to June 2015 and July to December 2015. \nFindings from this survey are discussed in Section V.L – Caseload – of this report. \n \n  Housing, Employment and Education Status Review for Older Youth Exiting Care \n \nThe Monitor collaborated with DCF to review case records of 81 youth ages 18 to 21 \nyears who exited care between January and June 2015 without achieving permanency and \n72 youth ages 18 to 21 who exited care between July and December 2015 without \nachieving permanency. The review focused on the education, housing and employment \nstatus of these youth to determine if performance met the level required by the SEP. \nFindings from the review are discussed in Section V.J – Older Youth – of this report.  \n \n  Visitation Data Review \n \nThe Monitor conducted a review of a statistically significant sample of 160 cases \nrequiring caseworker visits with parents and 181 cases requiring parent visits with \nchildren in which documentation indicated that the parent was unavailable or the visit \nwas not required during the months of March, June and August 2015. This is discussed in \nSection V.E – Visitation – of this report. \n \n  Investigation Extension Data Review \n \nThe Monitor conducted a review of a statistically significant sample of 158 cases where \nan extension request to complete investigations beyond the 60 day time frame was \nsubmitted and approved by a supervisor during the months of March, June and August \n2015. This is discussed in Section V.E – Visitation – of this report. \n \n  Family Team Meeting Data Review  \n \nThe Monitor reviewed 30 cases from March, June and August 2015 to verify how \nworkers were using and documenting legitimate reasons when the required Family Team \nMeetings (FTMs) did not occur. Further discussion of the current performance is \nincluded in Section V.B – Family Team Meetings – of this report. \n                                                 \n15 Not all data are verified for each monitoring period.  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE \n \nThis is the first report measuring progress under the SEP and includes performance data for the \nperiod January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.  \n \nDuring this period, DCF continued to maintain acceptable performance on each Foundational \nElement included in the SEP. Examples of continued performance on Foundational Elements \ninclude: \n \n  Quality performance on nearly all of the SEP health care measures that assess whether \nthe children in out-of-home placement have dependable access to health care; \n  Efficient and effective operation of the State Central Registry (SCR) that receives and \ntriages reports of alleged child abuse or neglect and maintenance of quality assurance \nmechanisms to support good SCR practice; and \n  A comprehensive and reliable training program for child welfare staff and supervisors on \npre-service, in-service and other training needs.  \n \nBetween January and December 2015, DCF also maintained performance on the 12 measures the \nSEP defines as Outcomes To Be Maintained. Examples of areas To Be Maintained that were \nsustained include the timeliness of institutional abuse investigations (IAI), meeting ongoing case \nplanning requirements and caseworker visits with children in custody.  \n \nDCF’s focus for improvement is now on the SEP Outcomes To Be Achieved. In order to \nsuccessfully make progress in the remaining areas of the SEP yet to be achieved, the state has \nbeen steadily building its continuous quality improvement capacity. In CY 2015, it refined and \nstrengthened its Qualitative Review (QR) protocol and process, intensified efforts that support \nquality supervision and made significant strides towards becoming a more transparent and \ncontinuous learning organization.  \n \nThis monitoring report demonstrates the state’s continued progress during CY 2015. Nine of the \n36 SEP performance measures designated as To Be Achieved have been met for all of CY 2015 \nand an additional five were achieved for the six month period between July and December \n2015.16 Three performance measures were partially met during this monitoring period.17  \n \nIn accordance with the SEP, based on its review of the evidence, the Monitor is to determine \nwhether DCF’s performance during the monitoring period satisfies each measure. If it does, the \nMonitor will certify the measure as To Be Maintained. In separate correspondence, the Monitor \n                                                 \n16 Measures met for CY 2015 (or most recent data available) include: IV.A.14 Timeliness of Completion (90 days); \nIV.B.16 Initial Family Team Meeting; IV.F.29 Parent-Child Visits – weekly; IV.F.30 Parent-Child Visits – bi-\nweekly; IV.G.32, Placing Siblings; IV.G.33 Sibling Placements of Four or More Children; IV.G.36 Placement \nStability, 13-24 Months in Care; IV.I.40, Permanency within 12 Months; and IV.K.45 Independent Living \nAssessments. Measures met for July through December 2015 include: IV.B.18, Subsequent FTMs after 12 months – \nReunification Goal; IV.E.26 Adoption Local Office Caseload; IV.G.34 Recruitment for Sibling Groups of Four or \nMore; IV.H.37 Repeat Maltreatment (In-home); and IV.K.46; Quality of Case Planning and services. \n17 Measures partially met during this monitoring period include: IV.C.21, Needs Assessment; IV.D.22, Initial Case \nPlans; and IV.I.43, Permanency within 48 Months.  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 7 \n \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 15 of 142 PageID: 7996\n               \n \nwill be providing information to the parties and the court on those measures the Monitor intends \nto certify as To Be Maintained.    \n \nA summary of the achievements, strengths and challenges of current performance on outcomes \ndesignated in the SEP as To Be Achieved follows. Data on all performance measures are \nprovided in Table 1 and the remaining sections of this report.   \n \nImplementation of the Case Practice Model  \n \nThe SEP places an emphasis on the quality of New Jersey’s case practice, measured in large part \nby the state’s QR. Between January and December 2015, DCF’s Office of Performance \nManagement and Accountability (OPMA) consulted with other states, national experts, the \nMonitor and community-based providers to update key portions of the QR process and protocol \nand to create a more user-friendly protocol with a common language for the workforce on DCF’s \npractice expectations. Beginning in January 2016, DCF revised the QR protocol to align with \ncase practice. Using a new sampling strategy based on the number of children served in each \nCP&P Local Office, between 10 and 30 cases will be reviewed in each county, every other year, \nwith cases drawn from each Local Office. Local Office supervisors will be included as reviewers \nin order to better integrate the QR process and ratings into case practice at the local level.  \n \nIn the QRs conducted from January to December 2015, using the original QR protocol, the status \nof children and families continued to be rated as acceptable in the majority of cases in most key \nareas including safety, living arrangement, learning and development and physical health of the \nchild, a significant achievement for the state. Overall, in CY 2015 key QR results on practice \nperformance indicators, while improved, remain below acceptable levels expected by the \nMonitor and DCF in areas such as family teamwork, case planning and engagement with parents \n(See Section V.N).  \n \nA critical component of the Department’s Case Practice Model (CPM) is the use of Family Team \nMeetings (FTMs) to engage families and their formal and informal supports to discuss the \nfamilies’ strengths and needs, craft individualized service plans and track progress toward \naccomplishing case plan goals. There are five performance measures in the SEP pertaining to \nFTMs; DCF met the SEP requirement that FTMs be held within 45 days of a child’s removal, as \nwell as the SEP standard requiring children with a goal of reunification to have at least three \nFTMs each year, but has yet to meet the remaining three SEP performance measures in this area.  \n \nPerformance on completing case plans remains strong; DCF continues to meet the standard for \nreviewing and modifying case plans within the required six month time frame and is close to \nmeeting the standard for completing case plans within 30 days of a child’s placement.  \n \nThe Monitor staff are impressed with the Agency’s commitment to the CPM and quality case \npractice in site visits conducted to three Local Offices in December 2015 in diverse geographic \nareas of the state. Monitor staff also heard about the need for more resource families willing to \ncare for large sibling groups and adolescents; transportation and capacity challenges in rural \ncommunities for families trying to access services and the need for more Spanish speaking \nservice providers. DCF leaders continue to use their continuous quality improvement (CQI) \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 8 \n \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 16 of 142 PageID: 7997\n               \n \nprocesses, including ChildStat and the QRs, to communicate that quality of work and attention to \nperformance metrics are both important. \n \nVisitation \n \nDCF’s performance on weekly visits between parents and children in out-of-home care exceeded \nthe required SEP target every month during CY 2015 and performance on bi-weekly visits \nexceeded the standard for most months. The required SEP levels of performance for frequency of \ncaseworker visits with parents when the goal is reunification and for visits between siblings who \nwere placed apart were not met.  \n \nPlacement of Children in Out of Home Care  \n \nDCF met each of the SEP requirements for placing sibling groups together, a significant \nachievement. According to the most recent data available (from children entering foster care in \nCY 2013), DCF also met the SEP performance target that children in care between 13 and 24 \nmonths have no more than one placement change. The stability of children during their first year \nin out-of-home placement is within reach, however it remains slightly below the SEP standard.   \n \nRepeat Maltreatment \n \nDCF showed significant improvement in the rate of repeat maltreatment of children who remain \nin their homes and met the SEP target for this performance measure. However, an area that \ncontinues to challenge the state is the maltreatment of children after reunification and re-entry to \ncare within one year of reunification. DCF leadership continues to target this area in its CQI \nprocesses.   \n \nPermanency for Children in Out-of-Home Care \n \nThe SEP modified the way in which permanency outcomes are measured to reflect advances in \nthe field’s understanding of how best to assess permanency progress. The SEP includes four \nOutcomes To Be Achieved related to timely permanency, each measured through entry cohorts of \nchildren and youth. The measures look at their achievement of permanency with specific \ntimeframes including permanency within 12 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 months. Data \nfor the most recent calendar years available show that DCF’s performance meets the required \nperformance level for permanency within 12 months and partially meets the required level for \npermanency within 48 months. DCF is close to meeting the required levels for the remaining two \ncohorts, permanency within 24 and 36 months.  \n \nServices to Older Youth  \n \nDCF’s work with older youth has been steadily improving; the state met the requirements for \ntwo standards this monitoring period – 1) completing Independent Living Assessments for youth \nand 2) providing acceptable quality case management and service planning as measured by the \nQR.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 9 \n \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 17 of 142 PageID: 7998\n               \n \nDCF continues to update and modify policies and practices to support well-being and \npermanency for youth involved with DCF and to achieve better outcomes for youth after they \nexit care. For example, in March 2015, the Office of Adolescent Services (OAS) received 100 \nProject Based Section 8 housing vouchers from New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs \nto provide long-term, stable and supportive housing opportunities for young people aging out of \nfoster care. In August 2015, the federal government awarded DCF funding to begin \nimplementation of its Youth at Risk of Homelessness initiative. The grant will be used to focus \non four outcome areas of housing stability, permanency, well-being and education/employment \nto prevent and address youth homelessness. In the previous six months, DCF finalized new \npolicies related to its LBGTQI population, with input from its LGBTQI Youth Committee, a \ngroup of community advocates.  \n \nIII. CHILD AND FAMILY OUTCOMES AND CASE PRACTICE PERFORMANCE \nMEASURES \n \nThe Child and Family Outcomes and Case Practice Performance Measures are 48 measures and \nFoundational Elements that assess the state’s performance on meeting the requirements of the \nSEP (see Table 1). These performance measures cover the areas of child safety, permanency, \nservice planning, child well-being and ongoing infrastructure requirements pertaining to \nelements such as caseloads and appropriate staffing.  \n \nMany of the measures are assessed using data from NJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures,18 reviewed \nand in some areas independently validated by the Monitor. Some data are also provided through \nDCF’s work with Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc. who assist with data analysis. Data provided in \nthe report are as of December 2015, or the most current data available.   \n                                                 \n18 SafeMeasures is a data warehouse and analytical tool that allows tracking of critical child welfare indicators by worker, \nsupervisor, Local Office area and statewide. It is used by different levels of staff to track, monitor and analyze trends in case \npractice and targeted measures and outcomes.  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families   June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The \nMonitor has also designated “Yes” for a requirement where DCF has met or is within one percentage point of the final SEP standard or there are a small number of cases causing \nthe failure to meet the SEP standard. “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close but, in the Monitor’s judgement, has not met the SEP standard, for example when \nperformance is met during at least three of six months for at least one six month period. “No” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, DCF has not fulfilled its obligation \nregarding the requirement.  \n22 Under the MSA standard, 98% of all abuse/neglect investigations were to have been within 60 days.  \n23 Monthly performance is as follows: January, 78%; February, 80%; March 79%; April, 79%; May 81%; June, 83%. \n24 November 2015 was the most current data available at the time of writing of this report.

FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS \n \nThe Foundational Elements section of the SEP (SEP II) intentionally recognizes \naccomplishments the state achieved and sustained in early implementation of the MSA. These \nFoundational Elements remain enforceable and the state is required to continue to collect and \npublish information on them. The state will be producing and disseminating through its website a \nseries of reports as described in the Introduction and in Table 1C of this report. These reports \nwill be grouped by areas and published according to an established schedule at different times of \nthe year; at the time of the writing of this report, not all of these reports had been produced.  \nUntil such time as these reports are all produced, DCF will continue to provide data directly to \nthe Monitor for verification. For any measure designated as a Foundational Element, the Monitor \nwill look first to the state’s data for analysis and perform periodic examinations to ensure that \ncontinued performance is maintained at the required level. At the Monitor’s discretion, if there is \nany concern that a Foundational Element has not been sustained, the Monitor may request \nadditional information. Further, if problems are identified, the state may propose and implement \ncorrective action, although this is not anticipated by either party.  \n \nA. DATA TRANSPARENCY \n \nSection II.A of the SEP requires “DCF will continue to maintain a case management information \nand data collection system that allows for the assessment, tracking, posting or web-based \npublishing and utilization of key data indicators.”   \n \nDCF has embraced a commitment to using qualitative and quantitative data for both management \nand continuous quality improvement (CQI). Their CQI capacity has been developing over the \npast several years and has helped leaders, managers and frontline staff better assess strengths and \nweakness of practice and develop targeted improvements. DCF continues to work to improve \ndata entry, quality and reporting through NJ SPIRIT. SafeMeasures v5, a data warehouse and \nanalytical tool, continues to be used by DCF staff at all levels of the organization to help track, \nmonitor and analyze trends in case practice in their own local areas. Additionally, DCF continues \nto regularly produce and publish agency performance reports on their website for public viewing. \nThe Commissioner’s Monthly Report, now includes key data on systems performance \nindicators.147 \n \nB. CASE PRACTICE MODEL \n \nSection II.B of the SEP requires the state to continue to implement and maintain a Case Practice \nModel (CPM) that is reflective of quality investigation and assessment, working with family \nteams, individualized planning and relevant services, continuous review and adaptation and safe \nand sustained transition from DCF involvement.   \n \nThe CPM was developed to guide and support staff towards a strength-based and family-\ncentered approach that ensures the safety, permanency and well-being of children, youth and \nfamilies. The CPM describes expected casework practice that requires engagement with children, \n                                                 \n147 To see Commissioner’s Monthly Reports, go to: http://nj.gov/dcf/childdata/continuous/  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 44 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 53 of 142 PageID: 8034\n             \n \nyouth and families through teamwork and crafting individualized case plans with families and \nchildren.  \n \nNew Jersey’s CPM is reflected in requirements in many parts of the SEP, however, the parties \nwill be measuring the state’s progress in infusing the principles and elements of the CPM into \ndaily casework practice primarily through the results of its Qualitative Review (QR) process, as \ndiscussed in Section V.N of this report. In the future, and in addition to reporting QR data to the \nMonitor, the state will report on its progress in this area through its annual Report on Work with \nChildren, Youth and Families and annually in its QR report (see Table 1C).   \n \nThe state continues to hold monthly ChildStat meetings and has been doing so since September \n2010.148 The ChildStat process encourages skill development through self-diagnosis and data \nanalysis. At the ChildStat meetings, Local Office leadership present practice issues, including \ndata on key performance indicators from the most recent two fiscal quarters and compares their \ndata to statewide data. The Monitor regularly attends DCF’s ChildStat meetings and is always \nimpressed by its usefulness in engaging staff throughout DCF as well as community partners to \nreview and assess the quality of case practice. In addition, the state is engaging in an effort to \ndeepen and reinvigorate staff’s supervisory skills through a number of statewide case practice \ninitiatives. \n \nPerformance during the months of January through December 2015 for safety and risk \nassessment prior to an investigation completion and risk reassessment prior to non-investigative \ncase closure continues to be met during this monitoring period. Under the MSA the Monitor \nreported these data semi-annually. The parties have agreed that in the future, these data will be \nreported annually in DCF’s Report on Our Work the Children, Youth & Families. According to \nDCF data, 100 percent of safety and risk assessments were completed prior to investigation \ncompletion and 100 percent of risk reassessments were completed 30 days prior to non-\ninvestigative case closure.149 \n \nC. STATE CENTRAL REGISTRY OPERATIONS   \n \nSection II.C of the SEP requires the state to continue to implement and maintain a system for \nreceiving, screening and timely response by the field to calls of suspected child abuse and \nneglect.   \n \nDCF continues to operate its State Central Registry (SCR) in a professional, efficient and \neffective manner with quality assurance mechanisms to support good practice. Reports of alleged \nabuse and neglect continue to be appropriately screened and forwarded within 24 hours of receipt \nto the field for investigation. Performance during the months of January through December 2015 \nfor timely transmission to the field and commencement of investigations continues to be met \nduring this monitoring period. Under the MSA the Monitor reviewed these data semi-annually. \n                                                 \n148 Drawn from CompStat in New York City, ChildStat is a process wherein organizations use quantitative and \nqualitative data from multiple contexts to understand and attempt to improve service delivery.  \n149 NJ SPIRIT now has guardrails that require workers complete the appropriate assessments prior to completing an \ninvestigation and prior to closing a case. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 45 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 54 of 142 PageID: 8035\n             \n \nThe parties have agreed that in the future, these data will be reported monthly in DCF’s \nCommissioner’s Monthly Report, currently available on the DCF website.   \n \nAccording to the February 2016 Commissioner’s Monthly Report, 100 percent of referrals were \ntimely transmitted to the field and 100 percent of investigations were commenced within the \nrequired response time.  \n \nD. APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS \n \nSection II.D of the SEP provides that “when out-of-home placement is necessary, DCF will \nprovide the most appropriate and least restrictive placements, allowing children to remain in their \nown communities, be placed with or maintain contact with siblings and relatives, and have their \neducational needs met. Children under age 13 shall not be placed in shelters, and no child shall \nbe placed out-of-state in a behavioral health facility without written approval of the Director of \nthe Children’s System of Care. The State shall maintain an adequate number and array of family-\nbased placements to appropriately place children in family settings.” \n \nSince the lawsuit began, DCF has been successfully building and maintaining a pool of \nplacement resource homes and group settings that meets the needs of children in out-of-home \ncare. DCF continues to keep pace with placement demands and is actively improving its process \nto recruit and license family resource homes in which to appropriately place children when they \nenter DCF custody. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 6,955 children were in out-of-home \nplacement; 6,329 (91%) in family-like settings, with 53 percent placed in non-kinship resource \nfamily homes and 39 percent in kinship homes. Seven percent of children were placed in group \nand residential settings and two percent were in independent living programs.  \n \nBetween January and December 2015 DCF recruited and licensed 1,244 new kinship and non-\nkinship family homes; 795 (64%) of the 1,244 newly licensed homes were kinship homes, \nreflecting the state’s continued commitment to licensing relatives.   \n \nA total of 1,648 resource family homes closed between January and December 2015, resulting in \na net loss of 404 resource family homes during the 12 months. DCF cites the growing number of \nlicensed kinship homes as the primary reason for the net loss of resource homes, as kinship \nhomes tend not to remain open at the same rate as non-kinship homes. This trend reflects good \ncase practice because kinship homes that close do so primarily because children are achieving \npermanency. The state has begun shifting its emphasis from the total number of homes licensed \nto a focus on targeted needs, such as homes for large sibling groups and adolescents. For \nexample, an effort is currently underway to engage the existing pool of resource families about \nthe need for homes that will accept large sibling groups. Another potential factor in the net loss \nof homes may be that from July to December 2015, DCF transitioned 210 contract agency homes \nto Local Offices, which diverted staff time from recruiting new resource homes to making sure \nthe new resource families were appropriately engaged and supported.  \n \nWhile DCF reports that it continues to have a more than adequate supply of resource family \nhomes for children in out-of-home care across the state, the Monitor will continue to examine \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This \nassessment considers whether the child or youth is residing in the least restrictive setting to meet \ntheir needs. This includes whether the placement allows a child or youth to remain in his or her \nown community, maintain contact with siblings and relatives and whether caregivers are \nsupportive of the child or youth’s education. Other considerations include whether the living \narrangement is consistent with the child’s language and culture and whether the placement meets \nthe child’s basic needs, including his or her need for emotional support, supervision, and \nsocialization. DCF met the performance standard in this area from January through December \n2015.  \n \nOverall, DCF has maintained its practice this monitoring period of keeping children under age 13 \nout of shelters.150 Beginning in January 2015, DCF began publishing data on shelter placements \nin the Commissioner’s Monthly Report. The Monitor will continue to receive DCF’s back-up \ndata on shelter placements and conduct periodic assessments of practice in this area. \n \nE. SERVICE ARRAY \n \nSection II.E of the SEP requires the state to provide comprehensive, culturally responsive \nservices to address the identified needs of the children, youth and families it serves, and maintain \nan adequate statewide network of Family Success Centers. These services shall include but not \nbe limited to services for: youth age 18 to 21, LGBTQI services, mental health and domestic \nviolence services for birth parents whose families are involved with the child welfare system and \npreventive home visitation programs.  \nYouth Age 18 to 21 Services \n  \nDCF continues to provide services to older youth in the areas of housing, education, \nemployment, general transition support, youth engagement and permanency and familial support. \nServices available by county and type can be found on the NJ Youth Resource Spot website.151 \nBulleted below are additional highlights for services to youth:  \n \n  The Adolescent Housing Hub (HUB) is a real time bed tracking and referral process \nsystem designed to assist youth with placement in transitional or permanent housing \nprograms. In CY 2015, DCF had a total of 368 housing slots for homeless and aging out \nyouth.  \n \n                                                 \n150 Between January and December 2015 two children under 13 were placed in shelters: one for one day in February \n2015 on an emergency basis after his father refused to permit him back in the home at midnight, and the other in \nAugust 2015 over a weekend prior to transferring to relative custody in Delaware. This shelter placement was in \nerror in that the workers assumed the placement was in a family resource home run by the shelter provider and were \nnot informed at the time of placement that the family resource program at the shelter had closed. The resource \nrecords have since been updated to prevent a similar mistake going forward.  \n151 To see the NJ Youth Resource Spot website, go to: http://www.njyrs.org/  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The housing programs created through these vouchers will include support \nservices and will be targeted for youth age 18 to 20 who are involved with or have \nexperience in the child welfare system and at risk of homelessness. Youth will be \ncoached to move on from the program by age 26.  \n \n  New Jersey continues to provide educational support through the NJ Scholars program152 \nand Project MYSELF.153  \n \n  The Youth Employment Specialist with the OAS has focused on identifying regional and \nstatewide employment resources; collaborating with the Department of Labor and the \nState Employment and Training Commission to build partnerships and increase access to \nexisting programs, networks and practices; and educating and providing resource training \nto DCF staff, providers and youth.  \n \n  Adolescent Practice Forums, facilitated by OAS, are held twice yearly and provide \nattendees with updates on changes and improvements to DCF youth-specific policy, \npractice and resources.  \n \n  DCF held a second round of Permanency Roundtables in January 2016, targeting youth \nbetween the ages of 14 and 17. Permanency Roundtables is a process developed by Casey \nFamily Programs to help staff strategize about potential permanency options for older \nyouth. \n \n  The 15 Youth Advisory Boards (covering 21 counties) meet twice a month and are open \nto youth between the ages of 14 and 22 who have experience with CP&P or \nhomelessness. The purpose is to discuss ways to improve policies, procedures and \nservices provided by DCF.  \n \n  On August 30, 2015, DCF learned they were awarded national funding to begin \nimplementation of their Youth At-Risk of Homelessness work. The implementation will \nfocus on the four outcomes areas of housing stability, permanency, well-being and \neducation/employment to prevent and address homelessness. Services will be piloted in \nBurlington, Mercer and Union counties.  \n \n \n                                                 \n152 NJ Scholars provides assistance with tuition and fees to eligible current and former foster youth in order to \npursue post-secondary education at an accredited two or four year college, university, trade or career school. Eligible \nyouth must have a high school diploma or GED. \n153 Project MYSELF is a multi-service mentoring program designed to improve academic performance, increase \npost-secondary education retention and completion and develop life skills and competencies.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Each region \nmeets three times a year and provides opportunities for trainings: a work group focused on case \npractice; LBGTQI resources; and data analysis, reporting and tracking. The LGBTQI Youth \nCommittee, comprised of LGBTQI community advocates, meets quarterly and provides \nfeedback to DCF on practice and services issues. The Committee provided feedback on the draft \nLGBTQI policy, which was finalized in late 2015.154 DCF launched its statewide Safe Space \nTraining at a meeting in December 2015 attended by over 100 participants.  \n \nInformation on specific LGBTQI services and supports are available by county on the NJ Youth \nResources Spot website. \n \nDomestic Violence Services \n \nIn October 2014, the Office of Domestic Violence Services transferred from DCF’s Family and \nCommunity Partnerships to DCF’s Division on Women (DOW). Thirty-two domestic violence \nliaisons are available in CP&P’s 46 Local Offices, at least one in each county, to provide CP&P \nwith on-site consultation, support and advocacy for the non-offending parent and children. Data \non DOW’s domestic violence programs, including data on residential programs that are over \ncapacity, are available on the Commissioner’s Monthly Report. Between January and December \n2015, DCF served 13,312 clients, the majority of services in non-residential settings.  \n \nHome Visitation Programs \n \nSince 2007 the state has doubled its support for home visiting programs, an evidence-based \ninitiative that provides information on health and parenting and links health and social services to \nfamilies with young children during pregnancy, infancy and until the child is age two or three, \ndepending on the model. New Jersey currently serves families of infants and young children \nthrough three home visiting models available to families in 21 counties statewide: Healthy \nFamilies, Nurse-Family Partnerships and Parents as Teachers, as well as Home Instruction to \nParents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) in Bergen County. Data on home visitation programs \nare available on the Commissioner’s Monthly Report. Between January and December 2015, \nDCF served 7,188155 families in its home visiting programs.  \n \nFamily Success Centers \n \nNew Jersey began developing Family Success Centers (FSCs) in 2007, initially with 21 centers. \nCurrently there are 54 FSCs, with at least one located in each of the state’s 21 counties. FSCs are \nneighborhood-based places where any community resident can access family support, \ninformation and services and specialized supports that vary depending on the needs and desires \nof the community in which they are located. Their function is to provide resources and supports \n                                                 \n154 To see the LGBTQI policy, go to: http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/policy_manuals/CPP-I-A-1-500_issuance.shtml  \n155 As of November 2015, both new and ongoing clients are reported for Home Visiting Programs. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

FSCs are situated in many types of settings: storefronts, houses, \nschools, places of worship and public housing. Services, which are available to any family free \nof charge, include life skills training, parent and child activities, advocacy, parent education and \nhousing related activities. Data on Family Success Centers and families served are available on \nthe Commissioner’s Monthly Report.  Between January and December 2015, 30,177 families \nwere served by FSCs statewide.  \n \nF. MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES \n \nMedical Health Services \n \nSEP Section II.F requires DCF to “continue to provide medical care to children and youth \nincluding appropriate medical assessment and treatment, pre-placement and entry medical \nassessments under EPSDT guidelines, dental examinations, up to date immunizations, follow-up \ncare and treatment and mental health assessments and treatment, where appropriate.”  \n \nAs part of the MSA, DCF successfully built child health units to facilitate and ensure the timely \nprovision of health care to children in CP&P custody. These units are operational in each CP&P \nLocal Office and are staffed with a managing Clinical Nurse Coordinator, Nurse Health Care \nCase Manager and staff assistants based on the projected number of children in out-of-home \nplacement. Each child in a resource home continues to have a nurse assigned for health care case \nmanagement. These child health units are a fundamental cornerstone of the reform effort, and as \na result of this investment, since June 2011 DCF has maintained or improved performance on all \nmeasures related to health care services.  \n \nFrom January through December 2015, DCF continued to demonstrate sustained access to health \ncare for children in out of home placement. In this monitoring period between 97 and 100 \npercent of children and youth entering out-of-home care received a pre-placement assessment \n(PPA) in an appropriate setting, considered to be a non-emergency room setting or in an ER, \nbased on the presenting medical needs of the child/youth. The state also met its responsibility to \nconduct comprehensive medical examinations (CME) within 30 days of children entering out-of-\nhome care. These examinations involve a comprehensive physical, including a developmental \nhistory and evaluation, and an initial mental health screening. From January through December \n2015, between 81 and 91 percent of children entering out-of-home placement received a CME \nwithin 30 days and between 98 and 100 percent had received this exam within 60 days of \nentering care. \n \nThe state also continues to provide children in out-of-home placements with timely \nimmunizations and annual dental exams: from January through December 2015, between 96 and \n98 percent of children and youth were current with their immunizations. As of December 30, \n2015, 99 percent of children and youth had received an annual dental exam. \n \nDCF continues to conduct a biannual review to determine if children in out-of-home care receive \ntimely follow-up care for identified medical needs and if children are receiving mental health \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 50 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 59 of 142 PageID: 8040\n             \n \nscreening, assessment and recommended treatment. For the period January through June 2015,156 \ndata show that 96 percent of children in out-of-home care received some or all follow-up care for \nidentified medical needs, 62 percent of children in out-of-home care who needed further \ntreatment following a mental health assessment received all of the recommended treatment and \nanother 29 percent had received some of the recommended treatment. For the period July \nthrough December 2015,157 data show that 86 percent of children in out-of-home care received \nsome or all follow-up care for identified medical needs, 77 percent of children in out-of-home \ncare who needed further treatment following a mental health assessment received all of the \nrecommended treatment and another nine percent had received some of the recommended \ntreatment. \nFinally, NJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures provide reports on when a child receives a required Early \nand Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) well-child examination. However, \nthese reports do not account for whether or not a child is clinically up-to-date with these exams.  \nThat is, a child may be noted in NJ SPIRIT as not up to date if the child was sick at the EPSDT \nvisit or if the visit was missed but rescheduled within a close time period. Also, especially for \nyounger children, once a child is off schedule, he or she will remain off schedule within DCF’s \ndata system for all subsequent EPSDT exams. Therefore, the Child Health Program conducts a \nsecondary review of all the records of children noted as “not current with their EPSDT exams.”  \nAs of December 2015, 90 percent of children under the age of two and 93 percent of children age \ntwo and older were up-to-date with these exams.158  \n \nMost of the health care tracking described above are currently available through the \nCommissioner’s Monthly Report and all health care data are anticipated to be available in the \nfuture in DCF’s Report on the Healthcare of Children in Out-of-Home Placement in New Jersey.   \n \nBehavioral Health Services \n \nSEP II.F also requires the state to “continue to provide behavioral health treatment in the least \nrestrictive setting for children and youth.”  \n \nDCF’s Children’s System of Care (CSOC) serves children and adolescents with emotional, \nbehavioral health, developmental and intellectual disabilities and co-occurring conditions. \nBeginning in 2012, the provision of services to children with developmental and intellectual \n                                                 \n156 The Health Care Case Record Review conducted by DCF to report on the above indicators for January-June 2015 \nwas done by reviewing records of a random sample of children in CP&P out-of-home placement who were removed \nbetween November 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015 and were in care for a minimum of 60 days. 1,768 children comprise \nthis cohort. A sample of 332 children was reviewed. The results have a ± 5 percent margin of error. \n157 The Health Care Case Record Review conducted by DCF to report on the above indicators for July-December \n2015 was done by reviewing records of a random sample of children in CP&P out of home placement who were \nremoved between May 1 and October 31, 2015 and were in care for a minimum of 60 days. 1,795 children comprise \nthis cohort.  A sample of 320 children was reviewed. The results have a ± 5 percent margin of error. \n158 For children under the age of two, performance on ensuring EPSDT between July and December 2015 ranged \nfrom 90 to 99 percent. For children over the age of two, performance ranged between 91 to 98 percent during the \nsame six month time period. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 51 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 60 of 142 PageID: 8041\n             \n \ndisability, formerly under the purview of the Department of Human Services (DHS), transitioned \nto CSOC.  \n \nCSOC continues to seek new opportunities to best serve such a large and diverse population. For \nexample, in 2015, the CSOC concluded its participation in a Developmentally Disabled \n(DD)/Mentally Ill (MI) Learning Collaborative facilitated by Georgetown Technical Assistance \nCenter which supported CSOC in focusing on skill development for both the CSOC team and \nsystem partners. CSOC also continued implementation of the Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver \nfocused, in part, on increasing supports for children and youth who have a risk of hospital level \ncare (i.e., seriously emotionally disturbed). Two pilots programs have begun -- one focused on \nchildren and youth with autism spectrum disorder and one focused on increasing services to \nyouth with a developmental disability and a behavioral health concern. Each of the two pilot \nprograms can accommodate 200 individuals.   \n \nThe Commissioner’s Monthly Report provides utilization and other descriptive data on the \nCSOC. Data from the Commissioner’s February 2016 Monthly Report show that DCF continues \nto serve an increasing population of children through community based care management and \nthat the number of children in out-of-home treatment settings in 2015 had declined since 2013. \nNew Jersey’s system of behavioral health services for children is impressive.  \n \nG. TRAINING \n \nSection II.G of the SEP requires the state to continue to maintain a comprehensive training \nprogram for child welfare staff and supervisors, and report training data for in-service, pre-\nservice, permanency planning, concurrent planning and adoption training, as well as competency \ntesting. From January through December 2015, DCF continued to meet this measure as it has \nsince early in the litigation.  \n \nUnder the MSA, the Monitor reported these data semi-annually through a review of a statistically \nsignificant sample of staff transcripts. The parties have agreed that in the future, these data will \nbe reported annually in DCF’s Workforce Report, currently available on the DCF website. \nHowever, the Monitor will perform periodic checks of training academy operations to validate \nthat continued performance is maintained at the required level. \n \nAccording to DCF’s annual Workforce Report, data from July 2014 through June 2015 show that \n100 percent of DCF’s caseload carrying staff and supervisors completed at least 40 hours of \nannual in-service training. In addition, DCF reports that from January 1 to December 31, 2015, \n269 staff were trained and passed competency exams in pre-service; 316 staff participated in \nconcurrent planning training; 316 were trained and passed competency exams in investigations \nand intake; 30 supervisors completed supervisory training; and 61 staff were trained in adoption \npractice.  \n \nH. FLEXIBLE FUNDING \nUnder Section II.H of the SEP, DCF is required to maintain availability of flexible funds for use \nby workers in “crafting individualized service plans for children, youth and families to meet the \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 52 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 61 of 142 PageID: 8042\n             \n \nneeds of children and families, to facilitate family preservation and reunification where \nappropriate, and to ensure that families are able to provide appropriate care for children and to \navoid the disruption of otherwise stable and appropriate placements.” \nFlexible funds are a source of money accessible to casework staff to meet the individualized \nshort term needs of a child, birth family or resource family. The fund is meant to assist families \nto purchase needed items, goods or services that they cannot otherwise afford in order to provide \nappropriate care for children, promote family preservation, avoid the disruption of otherwise \nstable placements and to facilitate family reunification. DCF will be reporting data on flexible \nfunding in its Annual Budget Report. As the Monitor reported in the previous monitoring period, \nin FY 2015 the flexible fund budget was $5,714,602. From January to June 2015, total flexible \nfund expenditures were $2,897,269.00 and from July to December 2015, these funds totaled \n$2,490,853.53, for a total of $5,388,122.53 in CY 2015. \n \nI. RESOURCE FAMILY CARE SUPPORT RATES \n \nSEP Section II.I requires that DCF “continue to adjust the resource family care support rates to \nmaintain them at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates for the cost of \nraising a child for the following State fiscal year. The State will continue to adjust the \nIndependent Living Stipend considering the USDA estimate rates for raising an adolescent, the \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Market Value for average rent in New Jersey, and \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates for monthly food and household expenses.”  \n \nHistorically the USDA’s Center for Nutritional Policy and Promotion reports annually on the \ncost of raising a child. The most recent USDA report was issued in August 2014 for CY 2013. \nThe USDA’s report for CY 2014 has not yet been issued. DCF will be adjusting its resource \nfamily care support rates and its independent living stipend based on receipt of the USDA’s \nannual reports and will be reporting the adjusted rates to the Monitor.159 DCF’s resource family \nsupport rates are also found in the DCF Online Policy Manual and in its budget report.  \n \nJ. PERMANENCY \n \nSection II.J of the SEP requires, “Consistent with the principles of this agreement, DCF will \ncontinue to strengthen and sustain appropriate permanency and adoption practices for the \nchildren and youth it serves, recognizing that DCF’s permanency work begins at intake and is \nencompassing of the elements of the Case Practice Model.”  \n \nPermanency is a cornerstone of child welfare work and DCF’s continued training and \nimplementation of the CPM provides a framework for staff to focus on permanency outcomes for \nchildren and families. The monitoring reports will continue to include outcome data for those \npermanency measures which are categorized as Outcomes To Be Achieved and Outcomes To Be \nMaintained, and the state will also be reporting more thoroughly on progress in this area through \nits annual Report on Work with Children, Youth and Families. \n                                                 \n159 USDA has altered its schedule for producing its Annual Report on costs of raising a child. By agreement, DCF \nwill update the rates within 30 days of the USDA report’s release each year to meet the SEP standards and will \nprovide written confirmation to the Monitor.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

ADOPTION PRACTICE  \n \nSection II.K of the SEP requires the state maintain the “process of freeing a child for adoption \nand seeking and securing an adoptive placement shall begin as soon as the child’s permanency \ngoal becomes adoption but no later than as required by federal law. The State will conduct five \nand 10 month placement reviews for children in custody. DCF shall commence the adoption \nprocess as soon as a diligent search process has been completed and has failed to identify the \nlocation of both parents or a suitable family placement. DCF shall develop a child specific \nrecruitment plan for all children with a permanency goal of adoption needing the recruitment of \nan adoptive family.” DCF will report on these data in the annual Adoption Report, which will be \navailable on DCF’s website. Specific performance data for five and 10 month placement reviews \nand child specific adoption recruitment plans for January through December 2015 are discussed \nbelow.   \n \nFive and 10 month placement reviews are routinely occurring. DCF reports that between January \nand December 2015, 90 to 98 percent of applicable families each month had the required five \nmonth reviews and between 79 and 95 percent of applicable families each month had the \nrequired 10 month reviews.  \n \nDCF workers hold these enhanced reviews in CP&P Local Offices for staff to engage families in \nconcurrent planning, a child welfare practice in use throughout the country that requires workers \nto simultaneously engage with families on reunifying children as quickly as possible while also \npursuing alternative permanency options should reunification efforts fail.  \n \nThe majority of child specific adoption recruitment plans are being completed in a timely \nmanner. It is CP&P’s practice to develop a child specific recruitment plan for children with a \npermanency goal of adoption who do not have an adoptive home identified at the time of \ntermination of parental rights. These plans should be developed within 30 days of a child’s goal \nchange. Of the 66 children requiring a child specific plan between January and June 2015, 56 \n(85%) had a child specific recruitment plan developed within 30 days of goal change.160 Of the \n51 children requiring a child specific plan between July and December 2015, 46 (90%) had a \nchild specific recruitment plan developed within 30 days of goal change.161  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n160 Of the 10 cases where the plan not completed within 30 days of goal change, seven (11%) had a plan developed \nwithin 60 days of goal change, two (3%) had a plan developed within 90 days of goal change and the remaining \nchild had a plan developed over 91 days. \n161 Of the five cases where the plan was not completed within 30 days of goal change, three (6%) had a plan \ndeveloped within 60 days of goal change and two (4%) had a plan completed within 90 days.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

TO BE ACHIEVED AND TO BE MAINTAINED \n \nThe remaining items in this report are areas in the SEP for which the state has satisfied the \nspecified performance targets for at least six months -- designated as To Be Maintained -- or \nareas of performance that the state still needs to achieve -- designated in the SEP as To Be \nAchieved. The state will continue to provide the Monitor with primary and backup data and will \nbe publishing reports as described in the introduction to this report and in Table 1A and 1B.  \n \nA. INVESTIGATIONS \n \nInvestigative Practice \n \nSection IV of the SEP includes four measures related to investigative practice.162 Section III.A of \nthe SEP includes one measure designated as an Outcome To Be Maintained, timeliness of IA \ninvestigations. The remaining three measures are designated as Outcomes To Be Achieved: 1) \ntimeliness of alleged child abuse and neglect investigation completion within 60 days; 2) \ntimeliness of alleged child abuse and neglect investigation completion within 90 days, and 3) \nquality of investigations.  \n \nThe MSA required that 98 percent of investigations of child abuse and neglect be completed \nwithin 60 days. The SEP, responding to feedback from staff and stakeholders that there are \ncircumstances where workers need additional time to gather pertinent information in determining \ninvestigative findings, modified the performance target and methodology (e.g., investigations \ninvolving the prosecutor’s offices and sexual abuse cases). The modifications to the \nmethodology include the addition of investigations with documented acceptable extension \nrequests in increments of 30 calendar days to complete investigations beyond the 60 day time \nframe. CP&P policy outlines acceptable reasons for extension requests and the supervisory \napproval process.163 \n \nTo assess performance for timeliness of investigation completion, the Monitor conducted a \nreview of a statistically significant sample164 of investigations where an extension request was \nsubmitted and approved by a supervisor during the months of March, June and August 2015. \nOverall, the review determined that 32 percent of the cases165 demonstrated appropriately \ndocumented extensions. These findings were shared with CP&P to verify the Monitor’s \nconclusion. Given the results of the review, the Monitor was unable to validate appropriate use \nof investigation extension requests and thus cannot determine performance for this monitoring \nperiod using the new reporting methodology. Data provided in this report on these measures \ntherefore understate performance by some unverifiable amount because it does not yet reflect \nacceptable extension requests.  \n \n \n                                                 \n162 Some of the measures were modified in the SEP with respect to performance target and/or methodology as \ndescribed in the text. \n163 CP&P Policy Manual 5-28-2013, Intake Investigation and Response, II.C.5.125 \n164 95% confidence level with ± 5 percent of error \n165 51 of the 158 cases reviewed.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Quality of Investigations: Investigations of alleged child abuse and neglect \nQualitative Measure  shall meet standards of quality. \nPerformance Target   85% of all abuse/neglect investigations shall meet standards of quality.  \nA case record review of the quality of CP&P’s investigative practice was conducted in \nSeptember 2014. The review examined the quality of practice of 313 randomly selected CPS \ninvestigations assigned to DCF Local Offices between February 1 and February 14, 2014 \ninvolving 477 alleged child victims.172 Overall, reviewers found that 244 (78%) of the \ninvestigations were of acceptable quality.173 The findings of this review reflect some clear \nstrengths in CP&P investigative case practice as well as areas in need of further development. A \nreport of the findings was released in May 2015.174  \n \nDCF and the Monitor will conduct a subsequent case record review to examine the quality of \ninvestigative practice in the fall of 2016. Findings from that review will be included in the next \nmonitoring report.  \n \nInstitutional Abuse Investigations  \n \nQuantitative or  1. Timeliness of Completion: IAI of allegations of Child maltreatment in \nQualitative Measure  placements shall be completed within 60 days \nPerformance Target   80% of IAI shall be completed within 60 days.  \n \nThe Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) is responsible for investigating allegations of \nchild abuse and neglect in resource family homes and other out-of-home care settings, as well as \nin child care facilities, detention centers, schools and residential facilities.175 From January to \nDecember 2015, IAIU received 2816 referrals. This is a decrease of 179 referrals (6%) over the \nsame time period in 2014.  \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2015 \n \nBetween January and December 2015, monthly performance for this measure ranged from 83 \nand 91 percent of all IA investigations completed within 60 days. DCF exceeded the final target \nfor this measure for the period of January through June 2015 and continued to do so for the \nperiod of July through December 2015.

The parties have agreed that in the future, these data will be publically reported \nmonthly in the DCF’s Commissioner’s Report currently available on the DCF website.  \n \nB. FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS \n \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) are intended to support and promote individualized case \nplanning. Workers are trained and coached to hold FTMs at key decision points in the life of a \ncase, such as when a child enters placement, when a child has a change of placement and/or \nwhen there is a need to adjust a case plan to achieve permanency or meet a child’s needs. \nWorking at optimal capacity, FTMs enable families, providers, formal and informal supports to \nexchange information that can be critical to coordinating and following up on services, \nexamining and solving problems and achieving positive outcomes. Meetings should be scheduled \naccording to the family’s availability in an effort to involve as many family members and family \nsupports as possible. Engaging the family, the core of New Jersey’s CPM, is a critical component \nof successful family teaming.  \n \nEngagement with families to support shared goals continues to be a primary focus of DCF \nleadership, Area Directors, Local Office managers and frontline staff. Efforts continue to be \ntargeted at improving practice in this area as well as documenting and entering data on FTMs \nand also to account for legitimate reasons when FTMs do not occur (either because the parent is \nunavailable or the parent declined to attend). Due to continued challenges in verifying data on \nlegitimate reasons why FTMs do not occur, performance data on FTMs include only the number \nof FTMs that have actually occurred. During this monitoring period, DCF provided the Monitor \nwith data intended to account for legitimate reasons when the required FTMs are not occurring; \nin those cases workers are to document the reasons for the legitimate exceptions. In January \n2016, the Monitor reviewed a random sample of cases and was not able to validate that workers \nwere appropriately using the exceptions.176 By agreement with DCF, as soon as the state \ndetermines that workers are properly using and documenting exceptions, the Monitor and DCF \nwill conduct a review of statistically significant sample of cases with exception documentation \nand will report on the findings. Consequently, the report continues to show the progress that has \nbeen made in the number of FTMs actually held.  \n \nThere are five performance measures pertaining to FTMs in the SEP; DCF met the SEP \nrequirement that FTMs be held within 45 days of a child’s removal for July through December \n2015. DCF also met the SEP requirement that children with the goal of reunification have at least \nthree FTMs each year, but has yet to meet the remaining three SEP final targets in this area.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n176 The Monitor reviewed a non-statistically valid but random sample of 30 cases that required an initial FTM from \nthe data DCF provided for March, June and August 2015 to assess if the exceptions were being applied according to \npolicy. Nine of the 30 cases reviewed were designated as “parent declined” and the remaining 21 cases were \ndesignated as “parent unavailable.” NJ SPIRIT documentation indicates that three of the nine (33%) cases coded as \n“parent declined” demonstrated appropriate utilization of the exception criteria and 16 (76%) of the 21 cases coded \nas “parent unavailable” demonstrated appropriate utilization of that exception criteria.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Performance from January to June 2015 ranged from a low of 73 percent in January \n2015 to a high of 87 percent in May 2015, with five of the six months either meeting or \nexceeding the final performance target. In December 2015 out of 244 possible FTMs, 207 (85%) \noccurred within 45 days of a child’s removal. From July to December 2015, performance ranged \nfrom a low of 80 percent to a high of 88 percent, meeting the final target in each of the six \nmonths.

VISITATION \n \nThe ability of children in foster care to visit with their workers, parents and siblings is integral to \nthe principles of the CPM and important to ensure children’s safety, placement stability, \nmaintain and strengthen family connections and increase children’s opportunities to achieve \npermanency. \n \nThe SEP includes six measures related to visitation and include changes to either the final target \nor methodology from similar measures in the MSA. Two measures are designated as Outcomes \nTo Be Maintained – 1) caseworker contacts with children newly placed or after a placement \nchange and 2) caseworker contacts with children in placement. The remaining four measures are \ndesignated as Outcomes To Be Achieved – 1) caseworker contacts with parent when goal is \nreunification; 2) parent and child weekly visits; 3) parent and child bi-weekly visits; and 4) \nsibling visits. Each of these measures were modified in the SEP to specify that there are \nlegitimate performance exclusions when a court order prohibits or regulates visits or there is \nsupervisory approval of a decision to cancel a visit because it is physically or psychologically \nharmful to a child. Monthly performance data on these measures are now provided on the \nCommissioner’s Monthly Report.187 \n \nCaseworker Visits with Children in State Custody \n \nBoth performance measures pertaining to caseworker visits with children in placement are \nOutcomes To Be Maintained in the SEP and required performance was maintained during this \nmonitoring period.  \n \n                                                 \n186 Children must be school-aged and in placement to be applicable for this measure. \n187 Currently, the Commissioner’s Monthly Report reflects only instances where visits occurred and does not \naccount for valid exclusions. Therefore, the data discussed in this section are different than those included in the \nCommissioner’s Monthly Report.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As there is a five percent margin of error with the sample, the Monitor calculated \nperformance conservatively by excluding from the universe of applicable cases 83 percent of the \ncases for which documentation indicated the parent was unavailable or the visit was not required.  \n \nBetween January and December 2015, monthly performance on this measure ranged from 76 to \n80 percent of applicable parents or other legally responsible family members were visited at least \ntwo times per month by a caseworker when the family’s goal is reunification (see Figure 9 \nbelow). For example, in December 2015, there were 2,979 children in custody with a goal of \nreunification for which an exclusion did not apply;192 the parents of 2,280 (77%) children were \nvisited at least twice during the month and the parents of an additional 512 (17%) children had \none contact in December.

PLACEMENT  \n \nDCF policy requires siblings to be placed together whenever possible, and that children \nexperience as few placement changes as possible while in out-of-home placement. The SEP \nincludes three measures related to the placement of sibling groups (Sections IV.G. 32 – 34) and \ntwo measures related to placement stability (Sections 35 – 36), all of which are designated as To \nBe Achieved and discussed in further detail below. \n \nThe SEP requires that at least 80 percent of sibling groups of two or three children entering \ncustody be placed together (SEP Section IV.G.32) and that for sibling groups of four or more, \nchildren will be placed with at least one other sibling in 80 percent of cases (Section IV.G.33). \nFinally, the SEP requires DCF to continue to recruit for resource homes capable of serving \nsibling groups of four or more (Section IV.G.34). As discussed below, DCF met each of the three \nperformance measures related to sibling placements.  \n \nMultiple placement changes for children in foster care often create long term negative \nconsequences: increasing social, emotional and behavioral problems; reducing school stability \nand achievement; and threatening children’s overall mental health and stability. There are two \nperformance measures in the SEP discussed below related to placement stability: one is similar \nto the MSA standard but changes the final target to require that at least 84 percent of children \nentering care will have no more than one placement change in the 12 months following entry into \ncare (SEP Section IV.G.35).

Recruitment of Sibling Groups of Four or More  \nQualitative Measure \nDCF will continue to recruit for resource homes capable of serving sibling groups of \nPerformance Target \nfour or more. \n \nSEP Section IV.G.34 requires the state to continue to recruit for resource homes capable of \nserving sibling groups of four or more children. As discussed in the Foundational Elements \nsection of this report related to Appropriate Placements, the state is shifting its recruitment \npractice from an emphasis on the total number of homes licensed to a focus on recruitment for \ntargeted needs, such as the need for more homes for large sibling groups. Part of this change in \nemphasis is a strategy to engage the existing pool of resource families about the need for homes \nthat will accept large sibling groups. Additionally, DCF continues to use market segmentation to \nstrategically identify and target geographic areas and local communities and venues where data \nshow successful resource families tend to live. During this monitoring period, and to enhance \nexisting networks in which to recruit families for large sibling groups, recruiters have expanded \ntheir relationships with faith-based communities around the state and with government entities, \nsuch as the Camden City Mayors Council, the Mercer County Council for Young Children and \nthe Cumberland County Council for Young Children.  \n \nDCF continues to identify, recruit and license resource family homes with capacity to \naccommodate large sibling groups, termed “Siblings in Best Settings” or SIBS, which the state \ndefines as homes with the capacity for five or more children or youth. DCF began and ended CY \n2015 with a total of 24 SIBS homes: 16 SIBS homes were newly licensed during the calendar \nyear and 16 SIBS homes left the program.201 \n \nStability of Placement \n \n35.

MALTREATMENT \n \nThe state is responsible for ensuring the safety of children who are receiving or have received \nservices from CP&P. This responsibility includes ensuring the safety of children who are placed \nin resource family homes and congregate facilities and preventing future maltreatment. There are \nfour performance measures included in this section.  \n \nThe prior MSA measure related to abuse and neglect of children in foster care is designated as an \nOutcome To Be Maintained in the SEP. Specifically, SEP III.H.12 requires that no more than \n0.49 percent of children will be victims of substantiated abuse or neglect by a resource parent or \nfacility staff member. 202 Performance data for this measure for CY 2015 show that of the 11,822 \nchildren in care at any point in time during the year, 19 (0.16%) children were victims of \nsubstantiated abuse or neglect by a resource parent, relative placement provider or facility staff \nmember. Current performance continues to meet the SEP requirement.   \n \n                                                 \n202 This measure is unchanged from the MSA.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Repeat Maltreatment (In-Home): Of all children who remain in home after \nQuantitative or \nsubstantiation of abuse or neglect, the percentage who have another \nQualitative Measure \nsubstantiation within the next 12 months. \nNo more than 7.2% of children who remain at home after a substantiation of abuse \nPerformance Target \nor neglect will have another substantiation within the next 12 months.204 \n \nPerformance as of CY 2014 (Most Recent Calendar Year Available):205  \n \nReviewing this performance measure requires examination of the experiences of an entry \ncohort206 of children and following their experiences over the next 12 months. In these instances, \nthe data are from a cohort of children with substantiated maltreatment in CY 2014, allowing for a \nfull 12 months from the incident of maltreatment to determine if another substantiation occurs \n \nIn CY 2014, there were 7,135 children who were victims of a substantiated allegation of abuse \nand/or neglect and were not placed in out-of-home care; 492 (6.9%) of these children were the \nvictims of a substantiated allegation of child abuse and/or neglect within 12 months of the initial \nsubstantiation. In-home repeat maltreatment rates have declined since CY 2013 and meet the \nrequirement of no more than 7.2 percent of children.  \n \nMaltreatment Post-Reunification \n \n38.  Maltreatment Post-Reunification: Of all children who are reunified during a \nQuantitative or \nperiod, the percentage who are victims of substantiated abuse or neglect within \nQualitative Measure \none year after the date of reunification. \nOf all children who enter foster care in a 12-month period for the first time who are \ndischarged within 24 months to reunification or living with relative(s), no more than \nPerformance Target \n6.9% will be the victims of substantiated abuse or neglect within 12 months after \nreunification.207 \n \n                                                 \n203 The target and methodology for repeat maltreatment for children who remain in home is unchanged from the \nMSA. The methodology used to measure performance for maltreatment post-reunification and re-entry into care \nwere changed to provide for use of entry cohort data.  \n204 The SEP final target for this measure was not changed from the MSA.  \n205 Data for CY 2015 will not be available until early CY 2017.  \n206 An entry cohort is defined by the year they enter care (or enter a certain category) and follow all of the members \nof the cohort forward in time.   \n207 The MSA final target for this measure was 4.8% and examined of all children who reunified within a given \ncalendar year, the percentage who were victims of substantiated child maltreatment within one year of reunification.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Since children within the entry cohort \ncan be followed for up to 36 months after entering care, the most recent calendar year data \navailable is from 2012.  \n \nIn CY 2012, 2,298 children entered care for the first time and discharged to reunification or \nliving with a relative within 24 months; 177 (7.7%) of these children were victims of a \nsubstantiated allegation of abuse and/or neglect within 12 months of their return home. \nPerformance exceeds the performance expectation of no more than 6.9 percent and this does not \nmeet the SEP requirement.  \n \nRe-entry to Placement \n \n39. Re-entry to Placement: Of all children who leave custody during a period, \nQuantitative or  except those whose reason for discharge is that they ran away from their \nQualitative Measure  placement, the percentage that re-enter custody within one year of the date of \nexit. \nOf all children who enter foster café in a 12 month period for the first time who are \ndischarged within 12 months to reunification, living with relative(s), or \nPerformance Target \nguardianship, no more than 9% will re-enter foster care within 12 months of their \ndischarge.209 \n \nPerformance as of CY 2013 (Most Recent Calendar Year Available):210   \n \nThis measure analyzes the experience of children who enter and leave foster care within a certain \nyear and timeframe to determine longitudinal performance on re-entry. Since children within the \ncohort can be followed for up to 24 months after entering care, the most recent calendar year data \navailable is from 2013.  \n \nIn CY 2013, 1,607 children entered care for the first time and discharged to reunification, living \nwith relative or guardianship within 12 months; 185 (11.5%) children re-entered placement \nwithin 12 months of their discharge. As shown in Figure 19 below, DCF performance on this \nrequirement has steadily improved but has not reached the level allowed by the SEP of no more \nthan nine percent of children re-entering custody within 12 months of exit.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n208 Data for CY 2013 will not be available until early CY 2017.  \n209 The SEP final target for this measure was not changed from the MSA.  \n210 Data for CY 2014 will not be available until early CY 2017.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

TIMELY PERMANENCY \n \nAll children—regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity—need and deserve a safe, nurturing \nfamily to protect and guide them. In child welfare work, this is called achieving “permanency” \nand can occur through a number of different avenues: safe family reunification is the preferred \nchoice, but permanency also includes living with other relatives, kinship/guardianship and \nadoption.  \n \nThe MSA included measures related to timely discharge from foster care to permanency as well \nas a number of specific adoption processes measures. The SEP now includes four permanency \nmeasures designated as To Be Achieved and all of these measures include a slight change in \nmethodology from the MSA reflective of methodological advances in the field in recent years \nregarding more accurate methods to assess permanency, primarily through the use of entry \ncohorts of children. Performance data discussed below are from NJ SPIRIT as analyzed by \nHornby Zeller Associates.  \n \nAll of the measures discussed in this section are longitudinal measures and the most current \nperformance available is discussed below. Additionally the foundational elements of the SEP \ninclude permanency and adoption practice which encompass elements of the CPM and \nrequirements regarding freeing children for adoption, securing adoptive placements and \ndeveloping child specific recruitment plans that were previously discussed in Section IV of this \nreport.211  \n                                                 \n211 See Section IV of this report for discussion of the Foundational Elements.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CHILD HEALTH UNITS \n \nAs part of the MSA Phase I requirement, DCF built Child Health Units to facilitate and ensure \nthe timely provision of health care to children in CP&P custody. These units are operational in \neach CP&P Local Office and are staffed with a managing Clinical Nurse Coordinator, Nurse \nHealth Care Case Manager (HCCM) and staff assistants based on the projected number of \nchildren in out-of-home placement.  \nSection III.E of the SEP requires the state to “maintain its network of child health units, \nadequately staffed by nurses in each local office.” Each child in a resource home continues to \nhave a nurse assigned for health care case management.  Since the developed of the Child Health \nUnits, the Monitor has requested and received data to assess the staffing adequacy and has found \nthe Child Health Units to generally be fully staffed.  \n \n \n                                                 \n222 Data for CY 2012 will not be available until early CY 2017.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Of the 168 HCCM, 162 \nwere available for coverage for a ratio of one HCCM to every 43 children in out-of-home care. A \nratio of one HCCM to 50 children in out-of-home care or less is considered adequately staffed. \nThis is a new SEP requirement that is being met.  \n \nJ. OLDER YOUTH \n \nThe MSA included several measures related to older youth, including creating policies and \nproviding continued support and services to youth aged 18 to 21, completing independent living \nassessments for youth aged 14 to 18 and ensuring youth who exit care without achieving \npermanency have housing and are employed or enrolled in an educational/vocational program. \nThe SEP includes four measures designated as To Be Achieved related to older youth which are \nadapted from the MSA and discussed in further detail below.   \n \nIndependent Living Assessments \n \nQuantitative or  45. Independent Living Assessments: Percentage of youth aged 14 and 18 with a \nQualitative Measure  completed Independent Living Assessment.  \nPerformance Target  90% of youth ages 14 to 18 will have an Independent Living Assessment.223 \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2015: \n \nIn the second quarter of 2015, there were 915 youth aged 14 to 18 in out-of-home placement for \nat least six months; 860 (94%) had an Independent Living Assessment (ILA) completed. In the \nfourth quarter of 2015, of the 870 youth ages 14 to 18 in out-of-home placement for at least six \nmonths, 808 (93%) had an ILA completed.

Section III.B of the SEP includes \nfour measures designated as Outcomes To Be Maintained: 1) Permanency office caseloads 2) \nPermanency individual worker caseloads, 3) IAIU investigators individual caseloads and 4) \nsupervisory/worker ratio. The remaining four measures are designated as Outcomes To Be \nAchieved: 1) Intake office caseloads, 2) Intake individual worker caseloads, 3) Adoption office \ncaseloads and 4) Adoption individual worker caseloads are within Section IV.E of the SEP.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As in previous monitoring \nperiods, the Monitor verifies caseload data supplied by DCF by conducting telephone interviews \nwith randomly selected workers across the state. Telephone interviews were conducted for two \nsix month periods in CY 2015. For each of the six month periods, 170 workers were randomly \nselected from a list of all active workers in June and December 2015, for a total of 340 workers \nin CY 2015. All 46 CP&P Local Offices were represented in the sample. The interviews were \nconducted during the months of July and August 2015 and January and February 2016. All 340 \nworkers were called and information was collected from 257 workers (78% of the eligible \nsample).230 \n \nDuring the interviews, the Monitor asked each caseworker whether their caseloads met caseload \nstandards during the applicable six month period; responses were compared to the caseload \ninformation from NJ SPIRIT on identified workers for the same period. Workers were also asked \n                                                 \n229 Secondary assignments refer to shared cases between Intake and Permanency workers for families who have a \ncase open with a permanency worker where there are new allegations of abuse or neglect that require investigation.  \n230 Five workers were on extended leave during the period of the calls and were removed from the sample. Two \nadditional workers refused to participate and two caseworkers newly assigned to the position for less than half of the \nmonitoring period were also removed from the sample. The Monitor made at least three attempts to contact all other \ncaseworkers. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The caseload verification involves looking at workers in \nall areas in which previously the MSA and currently the SEP had set caseload standards: Intake, \nPermanency and Adoption. For the past several years, the Monitor has weighted the sample with \nIntake workers to examine in more depth the impact of shared cases between Intake and \nPermanency workers. Among the 257 workers who participated in the caseload verification \ninterviews, 147 were Intake workers.  \n \nIn CY 2015 and during the caseload verification process, the Monitor received reports from \nIntake workers in a small number of local offices citing concerns with the way in which high-\nintake caseload volumes are managed in their offices and  irregularities with caseload assignment \nand data. The Monitor shared these concerns with DCF leaders. The Monitor’s review did not \nidentify how extensive these issues were but is assured that actions that may have been taken by \na small number of staff are in no way sanctioned by DCF leadership. To the contrary, DCF \nleadership responded immediately and appropriately once the concerns were identified by \noutlining and implementing meaningful corrective action steps. Nevertheless, the Monitor has \ndetermined that 2015 intake caseload data cannot be validated by the Monitor and a report on \nintake-caseload data should wait until the next report, covering the first six months of CY 2016.  \nDCF leaders have agreed with this decision.  \n \nDCF leaders have already initiated a robust internal process to assess the caseload data issues, \nincluding a comprehensive action plan focused on clarification of misconceptions with \nmanagers, supervisors and staff at all levels related to caseload standards; development of an \ninternal caseload verification process to identify and address case assignment and data \nirregularities on an ongoing basis; and the creation of a safe space where workers can \nconfidentially report caseload concerns about case assignment and data entries in NJ SPIRIT. \nOver the past year, DCF has also assigned additional FTE positions to the intake function. In the \nMonitor’s view, DCF’s response to these raised concerns appropriately targets early \nidentification, remediation, and ongoing monitoring, and it demonstrates DCF’s actions as a self-\ncorrecting organization.  \n \nIt is important to emphasize that at the writing of this report, the Monitor’s concerns are limited \nto Intake caseload data and do not extend to other categories of DCF data as included in the \nMonitoring Report, including the caseload data for permanency and adoptions workers. The \nMonitor will be working closely with DCF leadership as it implements corrective actions and \nwill conduct an additional intake-caseload verification in the summer of 2016 with the \nexpectation that any case assignment and data irregularities will have been resolved, and that \nverified intake caseload data can be included in the next monitoring report. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH QUALITATIVE REVIEW AND THE \nPRODUCTION AND USE OF ACCURATE DATA  \n \nQUALITATIVE REVIEW \n \nNew Jersey’s Qualitative Review (QR) is an assessment of the status of children, the status of \npractice and the functioning of systems in each of the counties. The protocol and process used \nfor the QR are aligned with DCF’s CPM. Select QR results related to both Child (Youth)/Family \nStatus and Practice Performance are also used to report on several SEP requirements included in \nthis report. Between January and December 2015, DCF’s Office of Performance Management \nand Accountability (OPMA) consulted with other states, national experts, the Monitor and \noutside community-based providers to update key portions of New Jersey’s QR process and \nprotocol. An important goal of this work was to create a more user friendly protocol with \nlanguage that is consistent with DCF’s other practice improvement efforts with the workforce. \nThis reinforces the state’s efforts to embed the CPM into everyday practice.  \n \nIn order to conduct the reviews, the child’s legal guardian is asked to give informed consent for \nparticipation in the QR. Trained review teams of two persons including DCF staff, community \nstakeholders and staff from the Monitor’s office review CP&P case records and interview as \nmany people as possible who are involved with the child and family. The team uses a \nstandardized protocol to report findings. The results from reviews provide critical qualitative \ndata on child and family status and system performance.  \n \nSince 2010, DCF has reviewed the cases of 12 children over a one week period in 16 of the 21 \ncounties across the state annually. Immediately following the review in each county, areas of \naccomplishment and challenges for the system are identified and discussed to inform continued \ncase practice improvement. Beginning in January 2016, DCF moved to conducting the QR in \neach county every other year. QRs will now be conducted in 10 or 11 counties each year. Using a \nsampling strategy based on the number of children served in each Local Office, 10 to 30 cases \nwill be reviewed in each county. The sampling plan was also adjusted so that the demographic \ncharacteristics of case reviewed will overall better match the demographics of children and \nfamilies served by DCF. The purpose behind staggering the reviews is to allow counties to \ndevelop and implement performance improvement plans between reviews. Supervisors and \nadditional providers will be recruited to serve as reviewers.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \nSEP Section IV.C.21 requires the state to “regularly evaluate the need for additional placements \nand services to meet the needs of children in custody and their families, and to support intact \nfamilies and prevent the need for out-of-home care.” The Needs Assessment, designated in the \nSEP as To Be Achieved, is to be conducted on an annual, staggered basis “that assures that every \ncounty is assessed at least once every three years.” The state is required to “develop placements \nand services consistent with the findings of these needs assessments.”  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Needs Assessment: The State shall regularly evaluate the needs for additional \nplacements and services to meet the needs of children in custody and their \nQuantitative or \nfamilies, and to support intact families and prevent the needs for out-of-home \nQualitative Measure \ncare. Such needs assessments shall be conducted on an annual, staggered basis \nthat assures that every county is assessed at least once every three years.  \nThe State shall develop placements and services consistent with the findings of these \nFinal Target \nneeds assessments.  \n \nDCF, in partnership with the Institute for Families at Rutgers University School of Social Work, \nis in Phase III of developing a Needs Assessment process to identify the strengths and needs of \nchildren and youth at risk for and those already entering out-of-home placement.  \n \nPhase I of the DCF’s Needs Assessment process involved a review of DCF internal reports and \nassessments completed by the Department and its partners from CY 2008 to CY 2014 to identify \ncommon needs across practice areas, including child maltreatment reporting as well as the \nprovision of services for families with children in the home and in out-of-home placement. Phase \nI also involved the formation of an internal workgroup to inform the assessment process, to \nidentify child and family needs and to prioritize service gaps. DCF published a detailed \ndescription of its Phase I activities in its Needs Assessment: Interim Report completed in \nDecember 2014 and available on DCF’s website (See Table 1B).236 In sum, DCF determined \nfrom its Phase I activities that families that encounter the child welfare system have difficulty \nacquiring safe, stable housing and accessing consistent, affordable transportation, employment \nand vocational opportunities and affordable food. The report highlights the need for accessible \nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment statewide.  \n \nDCF published its Phase II activities and findings in its DCF Needs Assessment 2015: Interim \nReport on its website in April 2016 (See Table 1B).237 As part of Phase II, DCF used New \nJersey’s state administered child welfare information system, NJSPIRIT – the state’s client level \ncase management system --- to determine categories of need for children and families served by \nDCF from 2009 to 2013. The seven categories the state identified as areas of need are: caregiver \nmental health, caregiver substance abuse, child mental health, child substance abuse, poverty, \nhousing and domestic violence.  \n \nKey findings of DCF’s Phase II client level data analysis for the years 2009 to 2013 are: \n \n  The areas of greatest need involve caregiver substance abuse and caregiver mental health.  \n  Caregiver substance abuse and mental health issues often co-occur with other needs, such \nas poverty, domestic violence and children’s mental health needs. \n                                                 \n236 DCF’s Needs Assessment: Interim Report 2015 can be found here: \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/childdata/continuous/DCF_Needs_Assessment_Interim-Report.pdf  \n237 DCF’s Needs Assessment: Interim Report can be found here: \nhttp://nj.gov/dcf/childdata/protection/DCF.Needs.Assessment.Interim.Report_3.16.pdf  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie                                                                                 Page 112 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 341   Filed 06/08/16   Page 121 of 142 PageID: 8102\n             \n \n  Between 2011 and 2013 reports to DCF of domestic violence in homes with children \nincreased by 22 percent. \n  Mental health issues and substance abuse among children decreased between 2009 and \n2013. \n \nDCF also analyzed the seven areas of need across counties in order to examine regional \nvariation. County level data show, for example, that between 2009 and 2013 caregiver substance \nabuse was less likely to be identified in northeastern counties, with the exception of Essex and \nHudson, and more likely to be prevalent in Sussex, Warren, Salem, Gloucester and Atlantic \ncounties. DCF’s Needs Assessment 2015 Interim Report provides an analysis of each of the \nseven identified categories of need, by county, for CY 2013. \n \nPhase II of the Needs Assessment process also involved identifying secondary data on the \ncurrent range of services available in the state.  The three primary sources for determining the \nstate’s range of services are (1) the service modules in NJSPIRIT, (2) the Department’s review of \nservice provider contracts by Area Office, and (3) forms used with DCF’s contract providers.  \nDCF reports that there are limitations to its review of secondary data due to data entry issues and \nthe generality of the information furnished by service providers about geographic areas served \nand types of services listed. The expectation is that DCF will be able to supplement its findings \nfrom Phase II with information obtained through the collection of primary data in Phase III. \n \nIn Phase III of the Needs Assessment process DCF will be examining primary qualitative data \nthrough focus groups and interviews with key internal and external stakeholders, including \ncaseworkers, service providers and families. DCF will also continue to analyze client level data \nto better understand the needs of subpopulations of children, youth and families. DCF anticipates \nthat it will complete Phase III on the Needs Assessment process in the fall of 2016. \n \nP. FISCAL YEAR BUDGET \n \nThe Governor’s proposed FY 2017 state appropriation for DCF, effective July 1, 2016, is $1.12 \nbillion in state funds, an increase of 0.6 percent over the FY 2016 adjusted appropriation of \n$1.112 billion. With the addition of federal funding, the total DCF FY 2017 budget will be $1.7 \nbillion. \n \nThe budget includes approximately $28.3 million of new state funding for CSOC based on \nprojected increased utilization of behavioral health services, including $12.7 million for out-of-\nhome treatment services, $8.4 million for intensive in-home behavioral assistance and $6.1 \nmillion for Care Management Organizations.  \n \nDCF leadership has indicated that the FY 2017 budget provides sufficient funds to carry out the \nstate’s responsibilities for child protection; children’s mental health; services to support children \nin their own homes and in out-of-home placement; and to achieve the SEP outcomes related to \nchildren’s safety, permanency and well-being. The budget allows for 6,660 staff positions; \nreflecting an increase of 17 positions over FY 2016 to meet SEP requirements.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families               June 8, 2016 \nMonitoring Period XVII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

On April ic, 2012, the Parties met to discuss the\npotential amendment ofcertainprovisions in the MSA and certain performance benchmarks for\ncompliance with the MSA.

RYAN, \nas Commissioner of the New Jersey \nDepartment of Children and Families, \nDefendants. \n--------------------------------------------------------\n)( \nMODIFIED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nPREAMBLE \nThis Modified Settlement Agreement (the \"Agreement\") shall supercede all previous \nagreements, oral and written, and resolve all disputes in the case captioned Charlie and \nNadine H., et aI., v. Corzine, et aI., Civil Action Number 99-3678 (SRC)  including \nwithout limitation, the claims of the named plaintiffs and the plaintiff classes as of the \ndate of original Settlement Agreement and Plaintiffs' Motion for Contempt and \nNoncompliance of December 1,2005. \nThe United States District Court for the District of New Jersey has subject matter \njurisdiction over the claims set forth in the Amended Complaint filed in the Action, \npersonal jurisdiction over parties to the Action, and the authority to approve and enter \nthis Agreement as a fair, reasonable and adequate settlement of the Action.  Unless \notherwise noted, the terms of this Agreement shall not take effect until the Court \napproves and enters the Agreement. \nThe United States District Court for the District of New Jersey shall have continuing \njurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement, and any documents incorporated \nherein, until such time as the parties agree to terminate the Agreement or the Court \nterminates the Agreement. \nIn the event that the legislation currently known as the \"Federal Consent Decree Fairness \nAct\" is enacted into law, Defendants agree that they will not invoke their right under that \nAct to modify or vacate the Consent Decree resulting from this Agreement.  Nothing in \nthis section limits the Defendants' ability to seek to modify or vacate the provisions of \nI \n\nthis Agreement under caselaw not interpreting the legislation that is currently known as \nthe Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act, and this provision is not intended to affect in \nany way other Consent Decrees that have been or will be entered into by the State. \nThis Agreement is not, nor shall it be construed to be, an admission of liability on the part \nof Defendants, or any of them, as to the truth of any fact alleged or the validity of any \nclaim which has or could have been asserted in the Action, or of the deficiency of any \ndefense which has or could have been asserted in the Action or of any wrongdoing or \nliability whatsoever, nor shall this Agreement be construed as an acknowledgment by \nPlaintiffs of the absence of such liability. \nAs set forth above, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the Court retain \njurisdiction over this Agreement and that this Agreement shall be enforceable by the \nCourt as provided herein.  It is also the intent of the parties that, notwithstanding the \npreceding sentence, the parties shall apply their best efforts to effectuate the purposes of \nthis Agreement and make every reasonable effort to resolve disputes prior to seeking \nCourt intervention.  Plaintiffs agree not to seek relief for isolated or minor violations, or \nfor violations relating solely to an individual child, unless that child is a named plaintiff \nin this litigation. \nUnless otherwise specifically stated in a provision of this Agreement, all provisions of \nthis Agreement shall be enforceable as provided herein and shall apply to all children in \ncustody, regardless whether they are in a placement made by the State or by a contract \nagency, and regardless of the type of placement. \nAll references to \"the State\" within this Agreement refer to and specifically apply to the \nDefendants, the Governor ofthe State of New Jersey and the Commissioner of the \nDepartment of Children and Families (\"DCF\"), acting in their official capacities. \nI.  PRINCIPLES OF MODIFIED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThe interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement will be guided by the following \nprinciples: \nA.  Children in out-of-home care should be protected from harm. \n1.  Foster care should be as temporary an arrangement as possible, \nwith its goal being to provide to children in out-of-home \nplacements a safe, nurturing, and permanent home quickly. \n2.  If at all possible, children in out-of-home placements should be \nquickly and safely reunified with their biological families.  If this \ncannot be accomplished, children need to be placed with an \nadoptive family, or in the permanent legal custody of an \nappropriate kinship family, in a timely fashion. \n3.  Families should be provided with the services they need to keep \nthem together whenever possible.  Families should be provided \n2 \n\nwith the services they need to allow for safe and speedy \nreunification whenever possible. \n4.  In making determinations about plans and services, the child's \ninterests are paramount. \n5.  Children in out-of-home placement should be in the least \nrestrictive, most family-like setting appropriate for their needs. \n6.  Children in out-of-home placement should be placed in settings \nthat promote the continuity of critical relationships:  together with \ntheir siblings; with capable relatives whenever possible; and in \ntheir own communities. \n7.  Children in out-of-home placement should have stable placements \nthat meet their needs, and should be protected from the harm \ncaused by multiple placement moves. \n8.  Children in out-of-home placements should have the services \nnecessary to address their medical and psychological needs, \nincluding those services needed to address problems arising from \nthe child's removal from his or her biological family. \n9.  Children in out-of-home placement must have timely decision \nmaking about where and with whom they will spend their \nchildhood, and timely implementation of whatever decisions have \nbeen made. \n10.  Children in out-of-home placement should be protected from abuse \nand neglect and, to this end, investigations of allegations of abuse \nand neglect in out-of-home placements should be timely, thorough \nand complete. \n11.  Adolescents in out-of-home placements should be provided with \nthe skills, opportunities, housing and permanent connections with \ncaring adults they need to successfully make the transition to \nadulthood. \n12.  The State shall make every effort to ensure that all children shall \nreceive equal and appropriate access to services without regard to \nrace, religion, sexual identity or ethnic origin. \nB.  Decisions about children in out-of-home placement should be made with \nmeaningful participation of their families and of the youth themselves to the extent they \nare able to participate. \n3 \n\nC.  In order to protect children and support families, New Jersey's child \nwelfare system should operate in partnership with the neighborhoods and communities \nfrom which children enter care. \nD.  New Jersey's child welfare system should be accountable to the public; to \nother stakeholders; and to communities throughout the State. \nE.  Services to children in care and their families should be provided with \nrespect for and understanding of their culture.  No child or family should be denied a \nneeded service or placement because of race, ethnicity, or special language needs. \nF.  New Jersey's child welfare system should have the infrastructure, \nresources, and policies needed to serve the best interests of the children in its care. \nThe list of principles outlined above is not intended to be exhaustive.  Rather, the parties \nacknowledge that the shared goal of improving outcomes for children will require \ncommitments to principles and outcome measures that are broader than the subject matter \nof this Action. \nII.

Corzine  \nJuly 2006 through December 31, 2006 \n \n \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  \nPurpose of this Report  \nIn July 2006, the State of New Jersey and Children’s Rights, Inc. reached agreement on a \nModified Settlement of the class-action litigation (Charlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine) aimed at \nimproving longstanding problems in the State’s child welfare system.1  As part of the Modified \nSettlement Agreement, which was approved by the Honorable Stanley R. Chesler of the United \nStates District Court on July 17, 2006,  the Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was \nappointed to independently monitor the State’s compliance with the goals and principles of the \nModified Settlement Agreement.  As Monitor, CSSP is to independently assess the State’s \nactions and to report periodically to the Parties and the public on the State’s progress in \nimplementing the terms of the Agreement and in achieving defined outcomes for systemic \nimprovement and improved results for children and families.   This is the first Monitoring report \nunder this Agreement covering the period from July 2006 through December 31, 2006.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement structured the State’s commitments into two phases of \nwork.  Phase I (from July 1, 2006 to December 2008) is primarily focused on building a strong \ninfrastructure and practice model within the newly-created Department of Children and Families \n(DCF) to ensure that children are protected and safe, helped to achieve permanency and stability \nin their lives, and that resources and service delivery systems exist to meet children’s health, \nmental health, educational and developmental needs.   Phase II, which runs from January 2009 \nuntil termination is focused on the State’s ability to reach and sustain defined performance levels \n                                                 \n1 Charlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine, Modified Settlement Agreement, United States District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey, Civ. Action No. 99-3678 (SRC), July 18, 2006.  To see the full Agreement, go to \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/home/Modified_Settlement_Agreement_7_17_06.pdf. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 1 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n\n \nfor children’s safety, permanency, stability and well-being.   This first Monitoring report \nprimarily addresses the State’s commitments to build the infrastructure within DCF and to \ndevelop and begin to implement strategies to support high quality child welfare practice –\nultimately leading to an improved future for New Jersey’s most vulnerable children and families.  \n \nMethodology  \nThe Monitor’s responsibilities under the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section IV) are \nbroadly defined: to verify the data reports and statistics produced by the Department; to \nindependently gather information from case record and other qualitative reviews; and to review \nall plans and documents agreed to be developed and produced by the State.  In preparing this \nreport, the primary source of information has been the Department of Children and Families, \nwhich provided the Monitor with extensive aggregate and backup data and access to staff at all \nlevels and across the State. Where possible, the Monitor verified the accuracy of the data and \nconclusions through a variety of means as specified in the body of this report. \n \nSection II of the report provides overall conclusions and a summary of the State’s progress in \nmeeting the Modified Settlement Agreement commitments through December 31, 2006.  \n \nOther sections of the report provide specific information on the requirements of the Modified \nSettlement Agreement as follows:  \nSection III:   Departmental Leadership and Organization \nSection IV:  The Case Practice Model for the Department of Children and Families \nSection V:  Building a High Quality Workforce (Training, Staffing and Caseload) \nSection VI:  Appropriate Placements for Children \nSection VII:  Meeting Health and Mental Health Care Needs of Children  \nSection VIII:  Permanency Planning and Adoption  \nSection IX:  Accountability through the Production and Use of Accurate Data  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 2 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nII.  OVERALL CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY OF PROGRESS  \n \nSummary of Accomplishments \nThe new Department of Children and Families (DCF) should be pleased with its \naccomplishments in its first six months of operation.   As shown in summary fashion in Table 1 \non pages 9-14 and discussed more in depth in the body of this report, DCF substantially fulfilled \nthe expectations of the Modified Settlement Agreement in each area in which activity was to be \ncompleted during this monitoring period.   \n \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement was constructed to permit DCF’s leadership and its staff to \nfocus first on fundamental building blocks without which the longer-term reform goals of the \nState could not be met.  As such, the Modified Settlement Agreement’s requirements for the \nperiod between July and December 2006 are heavily weighted toward building a solid \ninfrastructure for the future.  \n \nHighlights of the Monitor’s assessment of progress include:  \n \nThe new Department of Children and Families assembled a strong leadership team both in the \nCentral Office and in its Area Offices and committed itself with a clarity of purpose and a \nwelcome sense of urgency to improving results for the children and families it serves.  As DCF \nset about its work, it: \n•  Communicated a clear vision of change designed to improve results for children \nand families with Agency administrators and frontline staff and with key \nstakeholders including resource parents, providers, parents and community \nmembers; \n•  Successfully managed the transition of staff and functions from the Department of \nHuman Services to a newly created cabinet level agency; \n•  Worked to clarify responsibilities for functions within Divisions and Offices of \nthe Department; and \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 3 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n•  Promoted more effective two-way communication between leadership in Trenton \nand the field so that there is regular and honest dialogue about the strengths and \nweaknesses of the system and opportunities for staff at all levels to work toward \nproductive solutions for identified needs.  \n \nDCF leadership consistently focused on acquiring reliable and up-to-date data to inform \ninternal decision making and to share progress with staff at all levels and with the public at \nlarge.  DCF is now increasingly relying on data to inform its strategic thinking about what works \nand what needs to be fixed to support better results for children and families.  DCF is using data \nto uncover and understand problems, assess contributing factors and implement strategies to \nresolve the identified issues:  Examples include:  \n•  The delay in timely completion of adoption consent packets was identified as a \nsignificant barrier to adoption.  As a result, DYFS hired adoption expeditors to \nhelp alleviate the backlog in the Local Offices with the highest number of \nchildren awaiting adoption. \n•  Intensive efforts have been devoted to making sure that information about the \nnumber of active case-carrying workers and their assignments is up-to-date and \ncorrect.  The Department developed a sound methodology for projecting the \nrequired available workers to meet caseload standards, and this information is \nused to inform decisions about the allocation of additional positions and for \nstructuring regular discussions with Area Directors to stay abreast of personnel \nneeds and barriers. \n•  Detailed data about the problems Local Offices experience to ensure that children \nin out-of-home placement receive pre-placement medical examinations in non-\nemergency room settings led to a better identification of the resource availability \nissues and is informing work to develop more creative solutions targeted to the \nproblem.   \n•  Worker’s access to on-line data systems, which provide more accurate \ninformation about the status of their cases, is increasingly seen by local managers \nand workers as a tool for improving their performance.   \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 4 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe State met its Phase 1 commitments for the reduction of caseloads as of December 31, 2006.  \nThis means that average caseloads of DYFS workers have been reduced across the State.  While \nthere are still offices and workers with high caseloads, there has been positive movement across \nthe State, a trend which is confirmed by the caseload data and experienced by workers in the \nfield as a sign of progress. \n \nThe amount and quality of training made available to staff through the New Jersey Child \nWelfare Training Academy improved and continues to become more accessible, more responsive \nto the needs of the field, and more aligned with the outcomes that DCF must achieve.  The newly \nestablished Training Partnership with a consortium of New Jersey universities is designed to \ngreatly expand the scope and depth of in-service training for workers, and is expected to focus on \nthe skills and capacities that are needed to implement the Department’s Case Practice Model. \n \nDCF took steps to develop and publish a Case Practice Model that identifies the kind of case \npractice DCF committed to provide to every child and family in its care.  The Case Practice \nModel seeks to translate the basic principles that are embodied in the Modified Settlement \nAgreement into expectations for the ways in which DCF serves children and families.  The next \nchallenge for the Department is to ensure that 1) workers and supervisors are provided the skills \nand supports to deliver this practice, and 2) the array of services to support high quality work \nwith children and families exists in New Jersey’s communities. \n \nConsiderable thoughtful work is being directed to the diagnosis of longstanding key problems, \nincluding barriers to finalizing adoptions for legally free children; barriers to timely and \nrespectful licensing of potential resource families (foster, kinship and adoptive); and barriers to \nrecruitment of homes for children whose individual needs left them waiting for permanent homes \nfor too long. In each of these areas, DCF leadership and designated Central Office and local staff \nlooked closely at the number of children and families involved and their status, identified critical \nbarriers, and have begun to initiate steps to resolve them. This evolving process has only just \nbegun. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 5 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nAnalysis also began to identify the systemic and practice changes needed to better meet the \nhealth care and mental health needs of children served by the Department of Children and \nFamilies.  In each of these areas, the Department began to assemble the relevant data, reached \nout to the broader community to learn about the strengths and problems with existing practices \nand desired solutions, and just recently began the work to develop, propose and implement \nreform proposals.   \n \nThere are several areas where outcomes are improving and results to date are encouraging.  \nMost notable are:  \n•  The Department exceeded its target for the number of children with finalized \nadoptions in Calendar Year (CY) 2006.  One-thousand three-hundred eighty-\nseven (1387) children were adopted and are now living with permanent families.    \n•  The Department began to experience a net increase in the number of resource \nfamilies who are licensed each month, moving toward addressing the long-\nstanding problem of an inadequate number of licensed families available for \nchildren who need placement.   \n•  Most of the children newly placed in out-of-state treatment facilities from October \nthrough December of 2006 were placed in facilities within 50 miles of New \nJersey’s border, making it more possible that they can maintain connections with \ntheir families and communities.2 \n•  In January 2007, no youth waited for an appropriate treatment placement in a \njuvenile detention center for more than 30 days post-disposition.   \n \nThe State and the Monitor are cognizant of the fact that the hard and focused work during this \nMonitoring period and the encouraging trends are just beginning steps and there is much \ncomplex and challenging work ahead to achieve the ambitions of the reform and to meet the \nfuture commitments of the Modified Settlement Agreement.  It would be unrealistic to expect \nsignificant impact at this point in the new Department’s reform efforts on the ways in which \n                                                 \n \n2 Ultimately, the goal is for children to be placed close to their neighborhoods, communities and schools. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 6 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nchildren, families and advocates routinely experience the child welfare system.  It is important to \nacknowledge that the problems that led to the Modified Settlement Agreement are longstanding \nand wide-ranging and will not be completely fixed in six months, one year or even two years.  \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement prioritizes the expectations and requirements for \nimprovements between 2006 and 2010.  Better outcomes for children and families need to be \ndemonstrated all along the way, and there is much work that remains to be done. \n \nThe Work Ahead \nIn this next monitoring period, the Department will be held to even higher standards regarding \nthe building blocks (e.g., caseloads, supervision, training, resource family recruitment and \nlicensing, management and data systems) for reform.  In addition, the Department must begin the \neven more challenging work of translating their practice model into consistent planning and \ndecision making on the frontline and, in doing so, they must provide workers with the skills and \nsupport to engage children and families, comprehensively assess their strengths and needs, and \nlink them to services and supports that are essential to safety, stability and a brighter future. This \neffort requires not only providing the workforce with additional training and skill development \nbut also requires a review of existing policies and practices to ensure they consistently support \nthe Case Practice Model.  Over the next several months, the Monitor will work with DCF to \ndetermine how best to fully implement and measure the quality of this Case Practice Model. \n \nImportantly, Phase 2 of NJ SPIRIT, the State’s new information technology system, will begin \nits deployment in the spring and complete its deployment in July 2007.  Implementing a \nSACWIS system such as NJ SPIRIT is a challenging process even for the most prepared child \nwelfare agency.  This dramatic change is intended to facilitate the work of frontline workers as \nwell as provide vital information to DCF management.  However, it is to be expected that full \ndeployment of NJ SPIRIT will result in some short-term stress to the workforce. \n \nFinally, while much of Phase 1 focuses on building the infrastructure of DCF and solidifying a \nCase Practice Model, these efforts ultimately must improve outcomes for children and youth.  \nThere are many promising strategies that have been initiated or are in development by the \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 7 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nleadership at DCF.  The Monitor will continue to track the progress of these efforts and examine \ntheir effects on the lives of children and families.  Increasing the number of children finding \nsafety and permanency through successful reunification with their families, decreasing the \nnumber of children legally free for adoption and the time they wait for finalization, ensuring \nregular medical assessment and follow-up care, reducing out-of-state placement, increasing the \nnumber and quality of resource families, facilitating the appropriate and timely step down of \nchildren in higher levels of care are just a few of the positive outcomes the Monitor expects to \nsee in the next reporting period.  New Jersey is finally on a positive path toward reforming the \nway it delivers child welfare services to children and families.  Challenges of all sorts are ahead \nas previously described, but with its strong leadership team and increasing staff capacity in Area \nOffices and Local Offices, DCF appears well-situated to continue on its current trajectory. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

Corzine    Page 14 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nIII.  DEPARTMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATION \n \nA New Cabinet-level Department of Children and Families (DCF) was Created in July 2006. \n \nOn July 11, 2006, Governor Jon Corzine signed legislation that created the New Jersey \nDepartment of Children and Families (DCF) as a cabinet-level department with responsibilities \nfor child welfare, children’s behavioral health and the development of preventive services and \ncommunity supports for children and their families4   By creating this new department, the \nresponsibility of child protection was removed from the Department of Human Services (DHS) \nand placed in DCF.  The Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), Division of Child \nBehavioral Health Services (DCBHS), and Division of Prevention and Community Partnerships \nall were transferred from DHS to the new DCF with the goal of creating unified responsibility \nand improved coordination of services for New Jersey’s most vulnerable children and their \nfamilies.  The DHS Unit responsible for investigating institutional abuse (IAIU) was also \nrelocated to the new Department.  Appendix A provides the organizational chart for DCF. The \nestimated Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget for DCF is $1.4 billion.5  \n \nThe Governor appointed Kevin Ryan as the first Commissioner of DCF.  Commissioner Ryan \nhas extensive experience working on behalf of children and families as New Jersey \nCommissioner of the Department of Human Services and as New Jersey’s first Child Advocate. \nSince the creation of DCF, Commissioner Ryan assembled a strong senior leadership team6 and \nis working to build an effective infrastructure for this new department.  DCF has a workforce of \napproximately 7,000 employees, most of whom were transferred from DHS.  As is to be \nexpected, there were many human resource needs that required immediate attention when the \nnew Department was created. In addition to fulfilling the many technical requirements of \ntransferring so many workers (such as setting up new personnel and payroll accounts), DCF also \n                                                 \n4 N.J. Stat. §9:3A-3. \n5 According to the DCF budget documents, the Departmental funds are allotted as follows: DYFS $837.5 million; \nDivision of Prevention and Community Partnerships $52.1 million; DCBHS $420.3 million; NJ Child Welfare \nTraining Academy $6.4 million; and Office of Education $64.3 million. \n6 The DCF website contains additional information about the professional expertise of these individuals \n(http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/staff/) and the organization chart of DCF \n(http://www.nj.gov/dcf/about/DCFTableOrgOct06.pdf ). \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 15 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \ncreated supports for their workers including establishing an Office of Equal Employment and an \nemployee counseling program. \n \nDCF also focused on communicating with the public about child welfare issues with an explicit \ngoal of providing the public with greater access to information.  A website for the new \ndepartment was fully operational in July 2006, and it provides easy access to child and family \noutcome data, departmental news and accomplishments, and announcements of requests for \nproposals.  Information about the creation of DCF and the Modified Settlement Agreement are \navailable in English and Spanish as are most publications and outreach materials. \n \nFinally, extensive work went into setting up an appropriate financial system for DCF, \nparticularly separating funds from DHS and assigning them to DCF, establishing procurement \nprocesses and establishing procedures to appropriately manage expenditures against budget. \n \nIn creating the new organizational structure for DCF, attention was given to clarifying lines of \nresponsibility and accountability and improving communication throughout the Department and \nbetween the Central Office and the field. Key leaders at the Central Office level meet regularly \nto improve coordination among the Divisions and to track progress against defined work plans \nrelated to the Modified Settlement Agreement as well as other Departmental priorities.  Central \nOffice staff, particularly through the Directors of DYFS, Policy and Planning, and Training are \nin much closer communication with Area Directors and Local Office managers, in an effort to \ncorrect longstanding and debilitating communications problems.  Area Directors are more \nconsistently engaged as part of the Department’s leadership structure.  Anecdotal reports from \nthe field confirm a greater sense of shared understanding of the vision, goals and direction of the \nagency and perception of improved responsiveness to the needs of workers in the field offices.  \nExternal partners report greater access to information and enhanced communication with \ndepartmental leadership.  Efforts continue to improve communication and clarity about \nresponsibility and accountability within DCF Central offices and with Area and Local offices. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 16 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n \nIV.  THE CASE PRACTICE MODEL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN \nAND FAMILIES  \n \nIn the Modified Settlement Agreement, the Parties acknowledged the multi-year goal of \nachieving high quality practice with children and families that reflects the values and principles \nof protecting children and preserving families.  A key first step toward that goal is the \ndevelopment and communication of a shared practice model for DCF that defines who the \nagency serves, the expected outcomes of those services as well as the guiding values, principles \nand expectations of the work.  Without a clear model of practice, it is difficult – if not impossible \n– for a public child welfare system and its stakeholders to hold each mutually accountable for \ntheir work with children and families and for what they hope to achieve. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.A .1-3) requires the State to develop a Case \nPractice Model by December 2006 in consultation with the Monitor that is consistent with the \nvision and principles of the Agreement.  New Jersey has long been in need of a model of practice \nto guide its direct service work with children and families.  However, the model must be more \nthan words on paper, and the Department recognized that the more difficult work ahead is to \ntranslate the model into actions.  In addition, if the model is to be effective as both a guide and a \nframework for accountability, it needs to be developed with broad participation by and in \ncollaboration with the field and external partners.  In developing the Case Practice Model, DCF \ncommitted itself to a process of involving as many individuals and organizations affected by the \nnew model as possible. The final product reflects the Department’s effort to solicit advice from \nstaff, community partners, parents and youth as well as the Monitor and Plaintiffs. DCF \nconvened focus groups in the Northern and Southern portions of the State, and attempted to \nincorporate into the Case Practice Model comments submitted from each group. The Department \nalso researched case practice models from other states and incorporated many of their provisions \nwhile tailoring them to fit New Jersey’s history, needs and aspirations. \n \nAt the beginning of January 2007 DCF released its Case Practice Model.  In the short term, the \nfocus is on practice with children and families who come to the Department’s attention because \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 17 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nof alleged abuse or neglect and are served by DYFS, but the model will be expanded to include \nthe operations of the Division of Prevention and Community Partnerships and the Division of \nChild Behavioral Health Services in 2007.  The work to implement the model is only beginning. \n \nHighlights of New Jersey’s new Case Practice Model are: \n \n•  A mission statement for DCF: to ensure the safety, permanency and well-being of \nchildren and to support families. \n•  A definition of who DYFS serves: all children who have been abused or neglected, \nchildren who are alleged to have been abused or neglected, children placed into the \nagency’s custody, and families in which child abuse or neglect has occurred; children and \nadolescents with emotional and behavioral health care challenges, and children and \nfamilies at risk of abuse or neglect. \n•  A definition of the agency’s core values and principles that articulates the belief that \nchildren do best when they have strong families, preferably their own, and when that is \nnot possible, a stable relative, foster or adoptive family. \n•  The importance of engaging with youth and families, often by developing and working \nthrough family teams. \n•  Quality assessments and investigations, using a strengths-based approach. \n•  Individualized case planning and service delivery that strives to place children in family \nsettings while concurrently planning for alternative permanency arrangements. Here, in \naddition to the new Case Practice Model, DCF strengthened and enhanced its protocol for \nconcurrent planning. \n•  Continuous review and adaptation of case progress through the use of family team \nmeetings and other processes to review the child and family’s status, service progress, the \nappropriateness of decision making and goals, and to make adaptations as case goals are \nmet and circumstances change. \n•  A commitment to timely tracking and regular reports to the public on DCF’s performance \nacross key indicators. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 18 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe challenge ahead for the Department is to broadly communicate the Case Practice Model and \nto use it as a living document to frame and guide future work.  This means that it must be \nreflected in staff training; supervision and skill development; performance evaluations; daily \ninteractions with children and family members; protocols for developing and reviewing case \nplans and assessing decisions about placement and progress toward permanency; and \ncoordination among all divisions of DCF and with community providers and members. \n \nV.  BUILDING A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE  \n \nA key focus of the Phase I commitments in the Modified Settlement Agreement is to build a high \nquality workforce that is of sufficient number and has the right skills and qualities to meet the \ncomplex demands of child welfare work with children and families.  A principal failure of past \nreform efforts has been insufficient attention to training new and existing workers and \nsupervisors and to effectively recruiting, hiring and retaining workers.  The Modified Settlement \nAgreement includes a range of requirements for quick action on training and caseload reduction \nduring this monitoring period as an essential building block of reform. The Department devoted \nmuch attention to this work, and all of the Modified Settlement Agreement requirements through \nDecember 2006 with respect to training and caseloads were substantially met.  Each is discussed \nin the next section.  \n \n1.  Pre-Service Training.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the State to institute a pre-service training program \nthat provides sufficient training to newly hired workers to enable them to effectively protect and \nserve children and families (Section B.1.a).  Specifically, the pre-service training must be at least \n160 class hours, include training on intake and investigations for all staff, and be available for \nany new employee’s enrollment within two weeks of beginning work.  Further, the Department \nis required to have a process so that no case-carrying worker can assume a full caseload until \nafter completing training and until after s/he passes competency exams.  There are significant \nimprovements during this monitoring period in the methods and materials DCF uses to train its \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 19 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nworkforce. In the Monitor’s assessment, the New Jersey Child Welfare Training Academy \n(NJCWTA) made important strides in the past six months in its ability to provide new and \nexisting staff with quality training.   \n \na.  DYFS revised and clarified its processes for the initial entry and training of new workers. \n \nEffective August 2005, the requirements for training a new case-carrying DYFS \nemployee were revised as follows: \n•  As soon as a trainee is hired s/he is assigned to a Field Training Unit Supervisor \n(FTS) who serves as a training “guide” throughout the trainee period. \n•  Every trainee must be enrolled in pre-service training within two weeks of his/her \nemployment start date. NJCWTA staff review Human Resources reports every pay \nperiod for up-to-date data on new hires to ensure that trainees are properly enrolled in \ntraining.  \n•  Pre-service training now consists of 11 modules of classroom training. After each \nmodule of pre-service training, the trainee takes a competency test. The results of the \ncompetency exams are shared with the trainee and his/her FTS. \n•  NJCWTA trainers also prepare an interim and final progress report for each trainee \nthat is provided to both the trainee and the FTS. \n•  A trainee is not eligible to be assigned cases until after completion of Module 7 of the \npre-service training.  Cases are assigned to trainees at the discretion of the FTS and \nthe Local Office manager.  After a period of six months, the trainee transitions from \nthe FTS and is supervised by a supervisor.  \n•  Once the trainee has completed the pre-service training modules, s/he is eligible to \nenroll in required core competency courses which must be successfully completed \nbetween the 3rd and 11th month of service and are a prerequisite for moving from the \nCivil Service Trainee position to a permanent position. \n•  At the conclusion of six months of service, a trainee may be assigned a full caseload, \nat the discretion of the FTS and the supervisor.  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 20 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nb.  DCF revised the pre-service training curricula for all newly hired staff.  \n \nThe NJCWTA began using a revised pre-service curriculum in September 2006. The pre-\nservice training incorporates a newly revised curriculum that includes 176 hours of \ntraining, 32 classroom days and 20 days of field instruction.  Figure 1 below shows the 12 \nmodules in the pre-service training during the monitoring period. \n \nFigure 1:  Modules in NJCWTA Pre-Service Training Curriculum \n   \n   Module 1     Orientation \n   Module 2     Understanding Child Welfare in New Jersey \n   Module 3     Computer Applications \n   Module 4     Self-Aware Practitioner \n   Module 5     Life of A DYFS Case \n   Module 6     Taking Care of Yourself \n   Module 7     Functional Assessments for Child Well-Being, Safety and Risk \n   Module 8     Engagement and Interpersonal Skills \n   Module 9     Casework Applications \n   Module 10     Teaming with Families for Positive Change \n   Module 11         First Responders in Child Welfare \n   Module 12     Program Wrap Up \n     Source:  New Jersey Child Welfare Training Academy, 2006. \n \nDCF reports that 711 staff participated in pre-service training in Calendar Year 2006, an \nincrease from 462 staff in CY 2005.  The Monitor reviewed training logs of pre-service \ntraining participation for July through December 2006. During that six-month period, 363 \nstaff participated in pre-service training. \n \nAnecdotal reports from the field, including comments by Area and Local Office \nmanagers indicate that the new training curriculum is well-received by trainees and better \nmeet the Local Office manager’s needs for basic skill development for new workers.  The \nMonitor has not yet conducted an independent assessment of the pre-service curriculum. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 21 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nGiven that the curriculum needs some revision to reflect the newly developed Case \nPractice Model, the Monitor is waiting to review the training content in-depth until a later \nmonitoring period.  Now that the Department’s Case Practice Model is developed, the \nNJCWTA, in collaboration with DCF’s leadership, is beginning to assess the curriculum \nand is expected to make modifications as needed to ensure that it provides new workers \nwith the appropriate skills and training to carry out the Department’s practice \nexpectations.   \n \nc.  All newly hired staff are enrolled in pre-service training within two weeks of their start \ndate. \n \nThe NJTWA enrolls newly hired workers in training within two weeks of their \nemployment start.  To determine if a trainee is enrolled in pre-service training within two \nweeks of his/her start date, the NJCWTA staff cross-references reports from Human \nResources each pay period with signed rosters from participants in pre-service training \nsessions. The Monitor independently used this methodology to review trainees hired in \nOctober and November 2006 and found consistent enrollment in pre-service training \nwithin two weeks of the trainee’s start date. \n \nd.  The Department and the NJCWTA are taking beginning steps to assess the competency \nand skills of workers during and after pre-service training, although the Monitor \nrecommends that a standardized process be developed to certify that a trainee who has \ntaken competency exams has acquired sufficient skills to assume a full caseload. \n \nA process does exist for trainers from the NJCWTA to assess a trainee’s acquisition of \nknowledge and skills during pre-service training and to communicate that information to \nthe trainee and to the Field Training Supervisor.  Trainees are assessed after each module \nof the training to determine if they mastered the content, and an interim and final progress \nreport is provided to the Field Training Supervisor.  This is a considerable improvement \nover past practice by creating a connection between what goes on in classroom training \nand subsequent field training and skill development in the Local Office.  The decisions \nabout when a trainee is sufficiently skilled to assume a full caseload are made by the \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 22 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nField Training Supervisor after a review of the trainee’s performance on competency \nexams and their performance on assigned cases.  However, the Monitor is recommending \nthat the Department consider creating a standardized and more consistent statewide \nprocess for certifying how and when a trainee demonstrates evidence of competency \nperformance and skill development and is ready to assume a full caseload.   \n \n2.  In-Service Training.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement’s required timeline for in-service training for the existing \nworkforce will begin in 2007 (Section II.B.2).  During this monitoring period, however, the \nDepartment was required to take the initial steps to enhance its training capacity by revamping \nits overall in-service training program and offerings.  In the interim, the Modified Settlement \nAgreement required the Department to begin to 1) train all workers on concurrent planning and \n2) train all workers conducting investigations on intake and investigations processes, policies and \ntechniques (Section II.B.2.d).  The Department met each of these commitments as discussed in \nthe next section.   \n \na.  The State developed an RFP for the operation of a statewide training partnership and \nselected the State University of New Jersey – Rutgers School of Social Work to help \ndevelop and implement expanded in-service training through a statewide training \nconsortium. \n \nThe School of Social Work at Rutgers University plans to work with the NJCWTA to \nform a broader training consortium called the New Jersey Partnership for Child Welfare \nProgram (NJCWP). The first phase of the NJCWP’s scope of work focuses on developing \nthe consortium, designing and implementing a statewide training needs assessment, \npresenting training recommendations to NJCWP’s steering committee, and beginning in \nApril 2007, offering training for case aide and supervisory staff.  The second phase of \nNJCWP’s work includes formalizing five priority training courses for the existing \nworkforce to be designed and developed based on the results of the statewide training \nneeds assessment, and identifying experts to assist in teaching the priority courses.  It is \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 23 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nthe Monitor’s expectation that the in-service training will focus heavily on the skills \nneeded by workers to implement the newly developed Case Practice Model.    \n \nNJCWP is expected to provide 452 training days during CY 2007 and more than 900 \ntraining days during CY 2008. Courses will take place at locations in the northern, \ncentral, and southern regions of the State, and incorporate an extensive quality assurance \nprogram.  The full implementation of this training partnership has the potential to greatly \nenhance the State’s ability to develop and maintain a skilled and effective child welfare \nworkforce. \n \nb.  The State implemented concurrent planning training for staff; almost 2,500 staff have \nreceived concurrent planning, training and the remaining 400 staff are expected to be \ntrained by March 2007. \n \nDCF delivered training about concurrent planning to approximately 2,408 caseload- \ncarrying staff and supervisors in CY 2006.  Other staff, including new workers, litigation \nspecialists and case practice specialists also participated, for a total of 2,499 staff who \ncompleted the concurrent planning training.  Concurrent planning training is conducted \nby Rutgers University School of Social Work based on a nationally recognized \ncurriculum developed by Hunter College School of Social Work’s National Resource \nCenter for Permanency Planning.  Four-hundred eight (408) caseload-carrying staff still \nneed to be trained in the concurrent planning curriculum.  The Monitor reviewed a \nschedule for concurrent planning training through March 2007, which suggests that there \nis sufficient capacity to train the remaining staff.  Actual scheduling of the remaining 408 \nstaff should occur in the first quarter of 2007. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 24 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nc.  The State developed a new and improved curriculum for those staff responsible for intake \nand investigations.  Procedures are in place to ensure that all new staff conducting intake \nand investigations are trained.  Existing staff who currently conduct intake and \ninvestigations have begun training.  All existing staff members are scheduled to complete \ntraining and take competency exams by June 2007.   \n \nIn preparing for revisions to the existing curriculum on intake and investigations, DCF \nconducted focus groups with staff to determine what information they felt was most \nneeded. A new curriculum entitled First Responders, was pilot-tested by the NJCWTA in \ntwo sites. The Monitor reviewed the curriculum, attended the First Responders pilot \ntraining, and subsequently provided DCF with suggestions for improvement.  As a result \nof feedback from the Monitor and others, including DYFS field staff, DCF revised the \ncurriculum to include new information on safety assessments and safety planning.  The \nDepartment began providing the First Responders training at the end of September 2006.  \nThe pilot-test groups included 44 supervisors and casework supervisors. One-hundred six \n(106) trainees also took the First Responders training, for a total of 150 staff trained to \ndate. The training consists of 33 hours in five modules, including: Family Engagement; \nCommunication/Interviewing; Assessment; Documentation; and Quality Investigations. \n \nDCF expanded its pre-service training to include First Responders in Child Welfare \ntraining in August 2006.  The Modified Settlement Agreement requires that all workers \nperforming intake and investigations pass a competency examination following training \n(Section II.B.3.a.).  A competency examination was developed, pilot-tested and \nsubsequently refined.  The Monitor has not independently reviewed data on the results of \ncompetency testing on the First Responders training but intends to do so in the next \nmonitoring period. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 25 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n3.     Supervisory Training. \n \na.  The State developed a new curriculum for newly promoted supervisors that consists of at \nleast 40 training hours. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires that by September 2006, DCF develop a \nquality supervisory training program of at least 40 classroom hours that is consistent with \nthe principles in the Agreement and sufficient to meet the need for a highly effective \nsupervisory workforce (Section II.B.4.a).  In the summer of 2006, the new Department \nformally promoted a large number of staff to supervisory positions; it is this group for \nwhom the new training was initially designed.  All supervisors promoted to their \npositions before December 2006 are expected to receive this training over the next six \nmonths and to pass supervisory competency exams by no later than June 2007.  All \nsupervisors hired after December 2006 are expected to receive this training within three \nmonths of assuming their supervisory positions.  \n \nAs a prelude to revising the supervisory training curriculum, the NJCWTA conducted \nfocus groups with managers and field training unit supervisors and pilot-tested the \ntraining in two areas of the State. The Monitor also reviewed the supervisory training \ncurriculum and provided comments on the content and the methods.  The Monitor found \nthe revised supervisory training to be comprehensive, well-organized and strong in many \nways, particularly in its emphasis on tools for workers to engage the families they serve. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 26 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nb.  The State has begun offering supervisory training to newly promoted supervisors and has \nscheduled the majority of the remaining supervisors for training by May 2007.   \n \nTable 2 below provides data on the number of supervisors who received and/or are \nscheduled to receive supervisory training. \n \nTable 2:  DYFS Supervisory Training \n     \nNumber of Newly Promoted  Number of   Number of Newly \nSupervisors Completing  Newly Promoted Supervisors  Promoted Supervisors \nSupervisory Training as of  Yet to be Trained  Scheduled for \nNovember 2006  Supervisory Training \nbetween January and \nMay 2007 \n     \n    94      189             169* \n  Source: NJCWTA rosters, independently reviewed by the Monitor. \n  *DCF reports that 20 more supervisors will be scheduled by May 2007. \n \nTraining newly promoted supervisors – defined by DCF as any supervisor promoted \nbefore December 2006 – began in November 2006 and is scheduled to be completed by \nMay 2007.  The expectation of the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.B.4.c.) is \nthat this group of supervisors will train and pass competency exams by June 2007, and \nmoving forward, newly appointed supervisors will complete the training and pass \ncompetency exams within three months of appointment.   The Monitor’s independent \nreview of class rosters for supervisory training against Human Resource reports of newly \nappointed supervisors indicates that the NJCWTA is providing supervisory training \nwithin three months of the supervisor’s promotion.  All supervisors who completed the \nsupervisory training are assigned a final exam project, which is graded on a three-point \nsystem.  The exam is useful in that supervisors are required to apply skills they are \nlearning with their staff and they receive feedback on their acquisition of those skills.  \nThe examination includes an oral presentation as well as a written narrative of their final \nprojects.  The Monitor is unclear, however, how the exams are used in practice to \ndetermine whether supervisors have sufficiently mastered all the competencies required \nfor effective supervision.  The Monitor will look more closely at this issue in the next \nmonitoring period. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 27 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n4.  Caseloads \n \nNo child welfare system can be expected to be successful unless and until it has a sufficient and \nstable workforce.  High caseloads have been a problem in DYFS for years, and they are a visible \nsource of concern for agency leadership, the legislature, the union, workers and the public.  In \naddition, there has been considerable controversy for many years about the accuracy of published \ncaseload data and the State’s system for collecting, tracking and reporting data on the number of \nworkers and their caseloads.  Given this history, a high priority for the Modified Settlement \nAgreement is the accuracy and transparency of caseload data and visible progress toward \nreducing worker caseloads across the State.  Considerable progress was made on both of these \nissues in the past six months.  Average caseloads in Local Offices all across the State are \ndropping although, as anticipated, there remain some Local Offices with high average caseloads \nand some workers with caseloads too high to perform high quality work.  The State substantially \nmet all of its staffing commitments in the Modified Settlement Agreement for this reporting \nperiod, as discussed in the next section. \n \na.  The State has developed the required interim system for tracking and reporting \ncaseloads. \n \nDCF developed a system for accurately tracking and reporting caseloads that relies on \ndata primarily from its existing service information system (SIS) and from its personnel \ndatabase.  By working to keep these databases up-to-date and linked through manual \nmechanisms, DCF now has the capability to report separately on the “available” workers \nby functional responsibility – intake, permanency, and adoption.  “Available” is the term \nused to refer to those workers who are actually available to carry full caseloads.  \nTrainees, support workers, and impact workers are excluded from the count of available \nworkers.  However, DCF does report separately on trainees, support workers, and impact \nworkers who have assigned cases.  Finally, DCF produces regular exception reporting \nwhich is distributed to Local Offices and Area Offices for review and to update with \n1) Local Office personnel changes, 2) corrections to inaccuracies, and/or 3) explanations \nof differences between Local Office operations and the data in the system.  Keeping data \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 28 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \ncurrent and accurate on employees and their caseloads has become a shared Departmental \npriority and responsibility. \n \nConsiderable time and effort goes into obtaining and maintaining accurate information on \nworker status and caseloads at this time because the process depends on unlinked systems \nthat require separate and continuous manual updating to keep information in sync.  \nNevertheless, the focus and effort on obtaining and maintaining accurate information \nabout employees and their caseloads is critical, not only to the Modified Settlement \nAgreement but to the credibility of DCF with its workers and with its partners.   \n \nPrior to December 31, 2006, the Department posted caseload data quarterly on its website \nand continually refined what could be accurately shared with the public. The most recent \nrefinement is to disaggregate adoption caseloads from the other permanency caseloads.  \nStarting with the December 31, 2006 posting, the website reflects separate caseloads for \nintake, adoption and permanency staff and trainees will be reflected separately. (Section \nII.E.2) \n  \nb.  DCF achieved the December 2006 caseload target set for average caseloads for \npermanency staff. \n \nPermanency workers are assigned to provide case management of services to families \nwhose children remain at home under the protective supervision of DYFS and to those \nfamilies whose children are removed from home due to safety concerns.   To assure staff \nhave the time to devote to children and families with diverse needs and circumstances, \nthe State agreed to achieve a caseload standard that has two intertwined components \nreferred to as a “two-prong standard.”  One component is the number of families and the \nother component is the number of children placed out-of-home.  Permanency workers are \nto serve no more than 15 families and 10 children in out-of-home care.  If either of these \nstandards is higher, the caseload is not compliant with the Modified Settlement \nAgreement standard (Section II.E.6). \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 29 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nUntil December 2008 (Phase 1), caseload compliance is measured by average caseloads \nin an office.  Ultimately, the Phase I goal is for 95 percent of all offices to have average \ncaseloads for the permanency workers that meet the two-pronged standard. This goal is to \nbe achieved over a period of time with targets starting in 2006, and with the final target of \n95 percent to be achieved by December 2007. Starting in December 2006, average \ncaseloads in 60 percent of all 43 Local Offices were to meet the caseload standard.  \n(Section II.E.6) \n \nAs displayed in Figure 2, the State achieved this first target with available permanency \nworkers in 60 percent of the offices averaging 15 families or fewer and 10 or fewer \nchildren in placement.  This chart is posted on the Department’s website and also \nindicates the progress the Department made since March 2006.  Appendix B contains a \ntable with supporting details for each office. \n \nFigure 2: \nNJ DCF DYFS\nPermanency Caseload Compliance by Office*\nDec-06 Actual 60%\nDec-06 Target 60%\nSep-06 61%\nJul-06 58%\nMar-06 40%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n% of offices meeting permanency standard\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning, February 2007. \n*Adoption staff began to be counted separately in December 2006; previously they were listed as \npermanency staff. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 30 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe Monitor took several steps to independently verify caseload information.  First, in \nconjunction with Department staff, the Monitor reviewed monthly reports and the \nDepartment’s methodology for computing caseloads as well as the process used to verify \nand refine the caseload reporting.  This included looking at examples of communication \nbetween Central Office and Local Office managers regarding the exception reporting.   \nSecond, the Monitor participated in the final stages of the quality assurance effort as the \nDecember caseload report was prepared.  This review allowed for first-hand knowledge \nof the work done to assure accurate reporting.  For example, an issue about the actual \nemployment date for some workers identified as trainees in the first draft of the \nDecember report required additional work and communication with the Local Offices as \nwell as with Human Resources.  In some instances, workers who were listed in the DYFS \ninformation system as trainees based on their formal hire date, had in fact, passed their \nsix-month employment period based on the date they first were employed as a temporary \nworker.  They had completed their training period, which enabled them to be considered \nas available workers to carry full caseloads.   In addition to assessing the Department’s \ninternal quality assurance on the accuracy of caseload data and as added verification, the \nMonitor randomly selected 14 local offices for follow-up telephone discussions over a \ntwo week period with Local Office managers about the number of available staff and \nefforts to keep caseload reporting accurate. Our independent conversations with nine of \nthe Local Office managers7 confirmed the accuracy of the State’s caseload reporting for \nDecember 2006. \n \nc.  DCF achieved the December 2006 caseload target set for intake staff. \n \nDCF intake staff are responsible for responding to community concerns regarding child \nsafety and well-being.  They take referrals from the State Central Registry and, \ndepending on the nature of the allegation, they have 2 hours to 5 days to visit the home \nand begin an investigation/assessment.  They must complete their investigation/ \n                                                 \n7 Of the 14 offices selected, nine Local Office managers were interviewed; one manager was on vacation throughout \nthe review period, and interviews were not conducted with 3 managers despite efforts and exchanged telephone calls \nby both Local Office managers and the Monitor.  \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 31 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nassessment within 60 days. The caseload standard for intake staff also has two \ncomponents.  One component is the number of families under investigation or assessment \nat any given time and the other component is the number of new referrals assigned to a \nworker each month.  When fully implemented in Phase II (by June 2009), intake workers \nmust have total caseloads of 12 families or fewer and 8 or fewer new referrals per month.  \n(Section III.B.1.b) \n \nAs with the permanency caseloads, the Phase I standard is based on average caseloads in \nan office, and by December 2008, the goal is for 95 percent of all offices to have average \ncaseloads for intake workers that meet the two-pronged standard (Section II.E.7). As an \ninterim standard, starting in December 2006, 42 percent of all Local Offices must have \naverage caseloads for intake staff of 15 families or fewer and 10 or fewer new referrals \nper month.  (Section II.E.7) \n \nAs displayed in Figure 3 on the following page, the State exceeded this first target with \nintake staff since July 2006.  As of December 2006, 65 percent of the offices had average \ncaseloads for intake staff at or below the standard.  These data were independently \nverified by the Monitor as part of the previously described process.  This chart is posted \non the Department’s website and also indicates the progress the Department has made \nsince March 2006.  Appendix B contains a table with supporting detail for each office. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF achieved the December 2006 caseload target set for average caseload for adoption \nstaff. \n \nAdoption staff are responsible for moving children to permanency by developing \nadoptive resources and performing the work needed to finalize adoptions.  The Modified \nSettlement Agreement requires the State to move away from generic permanency \ncaseloads and to ensure that children with a goal of adoption are assigned to designated \nadoption workers with the exception of children who have an already established \nrelationship with a permanency worker who is also responsible for adoption work.  As of \nDecember 31, 2006, 81 percent of children in DYFS custody with a permanency goal of \nadoption had been assigned to an adoption worker.  Adoption workers are placed in every \nLocal Office with the exception of the three Newark Local Offices; in Newark, there is a \nseparate Local Office handling adoption work for the entire city. (Section II.G.9) \n \nAs with the permanency and intake caseloads, by December 2008, the goal is for \nadoption staff in 95 percent of offices to have average caseloads of 18 or fewer children \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 33 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nwith a subset of 60 percent of the offices achieving average caseloads of 15 or fewer \nfamilies (Section II.G.18).  Starting in December 2006, adoption staff in 35 percent of all \nLocal Offices are to have average caseloads of 18 or fewer children.  (Section II.G.10) \n \nAs displayed in Figure 4 below, the State far exceeded this first target with adoption staff \nin 65 percent of the offices having average caseloads for adoption staff at or below the \nstandard.  This information was verified by the Monitor using the previously described \napproach.  This chart is posted on the Department’s website.  Appendix B contains a \ntable with supporting detail for each office. \n \nFigure 4: \nNJ DCF DYFS\nAdoption Caseload Compliance*\nDec-06 Actual 65%\nDec-06 Target 35%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n% of offices meeting interim adoption standard\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning, February 2007. \n*Prior to December 2006, adoption staff were included in permanency staff numbers. \n \ne.  DCF appears to have met the benchmark for ratio of supervisors to workers through the \nutilization of frontline casework supervisors ( SFSS2) and the assignment of unit \nsupervisors (SFSS1). \n \nSupervision is a critical role in child welfare, and the span of supervisory responsibility \nshould be limited to allow more effective individual supervision.  Therefore, the \nModified Settlement Agreement also establishes standards for supervisory ratios.  By \nDecember 2008, 95 percent of all offices should be able to maintain a 5 worker to 1 \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 34 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nsupervisor ratio (Section II.E.8).  Like the caseload standards, this standard was to be \nphased in starting in December 2006, with a target of 80 percent of the offices meeting \nthe 5 to 1 ratio (Section II.E.8). \n \nThe Department has two supervisor levels.  One level, Supervising Family Service \nSpecialist 2 (SFSS2), is a direct frontline supervisor position responsible for supervising \na casework unit.  The field refers to this position as “supervisor” or “unit supervisor.”  \nThe second level is Supervising Family Service Specialist 1 (SFSS1).  In the field, this \nposition is referred to as “Casework Supervisor.”  In general, three unit supervisors \ntypically report to a Casework Supervisor.  By combining the individuals in both \nsupervisory levels in each office, the State appears to have met the December 2006 target \nwith 95 percent of the offices having “sufficient supervisory staff” to maintain a 5 worker \nto 1 supervisor ratio (see Figure 5 below).  Applying only available SFFS2 positions to \ncompute the supervisory ratio, 61% of local offices have met the supervisory interim \nstandard.  The Department has reported that some Casework Supervisors are temporarily \nsupervising frontline staff as the offices move to fill allocated unit supervisor (SFSS2) \npositions.  During the next reporting period, the Monitor will review the interim \nassignment of SFFS1 supervisors to support direct worker supervision and will collect \nmore information about supervisor ratios during visits to Local Offices.  Appendix B \ncontains a table with supporting detail for each office, including the number of \nsupervisors in each level. \nFigure 5: \nNJ DCF DYFS \nCompliance With Supervisor-to-Worker Ratio\nDec-06 Target 80%\nDec-06 Actual with 61%\nSFFS2 Supv.

DCF hired a new Human Resource Director. \n \nDCF developed and filled the position of Director of Human Resources and Labor \nRelations (Section II.E.3).  The new Director has extensive public service human \nresource and labor relations experience in New Jersey including twenty years in senior \nexecutive positions in the New Jersey Department of Personnel. As part of the leadership \nteam in DCF, the new Director has helped to implement an overall hiring plan that is \nbased on individual office need-based projections for staff. The hiring plan calls for \nfilling 203 casework positions and 42 supervisor positions between July 1, 2006 and \nJune 30, 2007. \n \nThe positions authorized for each office are based on actual workload and the caseload \nstandards to be achieved and sustained.  The projections for July 2006 through March \n2007 were reassessed in January 2007 based on the actual experience of July through \nDecember 2006, and some reallocation of new hires projected among offices took place.  \nThe DCF Human Resource Director joins the DYFS Director in weekly teleconferences \nwith Area Office managers to review and track hiring and position vacancies against the \nplan and other personnel issues raised by the managers.    \n \nTypically, the bi-weekly conversations, referred to as “position control calls,” allow Area \nOffice managers to 1) cover the steps they are taking to fill positions, including the \nsource of candidates, interviews planned, offers to be made and likely timeframes for \nfilling positions; 2) confirm filled positions and start dates within the previous week and \nensure that Human Resources has the appropriate completed paperwork to ensure a \nsmooth process for new hires; and 3) raise questions and problems.  The Human \nResources Director and staff troubleshoot and help problem solve around positions – \nwhat can and cannot be done within the New Jersey Civil Service requirements. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 36 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nb.  Strengthening and streamlining the recruitment and hiring process \n \nThe Human Resources Director revamped the recruitment and hiring process.  \nPreviously, recruitment and hiring was entirely a local responsibility.   Now it is a shared \nresponsibility.  Initial candidate screening is done by the Central Office, enabling a more \nuniform process.  Priority is given to individuals with Bachelor and Master degrees in \nSocial Work.  Accepted candidates are invited to bi-monthly regional “job fests” where \nLocal Office representatives are given an opportunity to meet and interview candidates.  \nIf the candidates pass these interviews, they are placed in an eligible pool according to \ntheir geographic preference and interests.  Candidates stay in this pool for a year, \navailable for Local Offices to contact and hire.  As of November 2006, 400 candidates \nare in this pool.   \n \nLocal Office managers interviewed about the recruitment and hiring process were pleased \nwith how the process is now working.  They believe they are getting good candidates to \nconsider with the necessary skills, including bilingual capability.  Some offices add an \nadditional step by inviting candidates for a “meet and greet” orientation to help the \ncandidates obtain a full understanding of the work.  Others hire directly from the \ncandidate pool after meeting candidates at the job fest.   \n \nHowever, the lists of qualified candidates for higher classified positions such as \nsupervisory positions have been reduced since the last supervisory qualifying test was \ngiven in 2005.  DCF asked the State Department of Personnel (DOP) to offer another \ncertifying test to re-populate the list with qualified candidates.  DOP is doing a job \nanalysis to identify needed changes to the test to assure that they have a tool to assess the \ncandidates based on the current work of DCF rather than that of two years ago.  DCF, \ntherefore, has an opportunity to ask DOP to consider and incorporate the supervisory \nskills required by the Case Practice Model. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 37 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nRetention of workers also appears to be improving.  Overall, DCF reports that the \nattrition rate is down from 14 percent in 2004/2005 to 11 percent in the period between \nNovember 2005 and October 2006.  To improve workforce stability further, DCF Human \nResources is renewing efforts to complete exit interviews for all staff that leave \nemployment.  They hope these interviews will provide information on how to improve \nthe work place and job satisfaction. \n \n \nVI.  APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS AND SERVICES FOR CHILDREN   \n \nAs of January 6, 2007, there were 10,379 New Jersey children in placement under the \nsupervision of the DCF’s Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS).  Figure 6 below \nshows the types of settings where children are placed. \n \nFigure 6: \nNJ DCF DYFS \nChildren in Placement by Placement Type \n(Total = 10,379, January 6, 2007, point-in-time) \n \nIndependent  Group & \nLiving Residential\n158 1552\n2% 15%\nKinship\nResource Family\n3709\n4960\n36%\n47%\n \n  Source:  DCF, Office of Policy and Planning, February 2007. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

Resource Family Recruitment, Licensing and Retention  \n \nWhen children cannot be maintained safely at home because they have been abused or neglected \nor are at risk of abuse or neglect, it is the responsibility of DYFS to remove them from their \nfamilies and place them in a safe and stable alternative – if at all possible – in a family with an \nappropriate relative or with an approved resource family.  The Modified Settlement Agreement \n(Section I.A) and the DCF practice model further state that when children need to be placed, \nefforts must be made to place them with siblings, close to their neighborhoods and schools, and \nwith families that can, if necessary, become a permanent placement.  Recruitment and retention \nof the appropriate array of resource families has long been a serious problem for the State. DCF \nspent its first six months intensively investigating and assessing the problems and barriers to \nresource family recruitment, licensing and retention.  As a result of its findings, DCF made some \nkey changes and is beginning to build a new infrastructure to support this work. \n  \na.  The State established a baseline of available resource family homes that separately \nidentifies kinship and non-kinship resource homes. \n \nTo produce an accurate baseline of available resource family homes, DCF went through \nthe arduous process of hand-counting computer-generated data on active resource family \nhomes, distinguishing kinship from non-kinship homes. The result is shown in Table 3 \nbelow. This is a baseline only; the next monitoring period requires DCF maintain an \naccurate list of current kinship and non-kinship resource family homes and to create \nsystems to set and track targets. \n \nTable 3:   Baseline of DCF Licensed Family Resource Homes \nas of December 31,  2006 \n   \nNon kinship resource family homes (DCF licensed)  2,260 \nResource family homes  (licensed and supervised by Babyland)  114 \nResource family homes  (licensed and supervised by Tri-City)  74 \nTreatment Homes (DCF licensed)  504 \n   \nTotal non-kinship resource family homes  2,952 \nKinship resource family homes  + 2,584 \n \n   \nTotal kinship and non-kinship resource family homes  5,536 \n             Source:  New Jersey DCF, 2006. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

The resource family licensing function was incorporated into DCF with the creation of \nthe new Department in July 2006.  \n \nIn order to provide clearer lines of authority and accountability for the recruitment and \nlicensure of resource homes, the Modified Settlement Agreement requires that the \nfunction of resource family licensing be incorporated into DCF (Section II.H.1).  A new \nResource Family Director with more than 30 years experience in child welfare was \nappointed in September 2006.  In October 2006, she assumed responsibility for the \nresource family licensing, a unit that formerly reported to the Office of Licensing (OOL) \nas well as for resource family recruitment and support. This important shift helped unify \ntwo divisions: Resource Family Support and Resource Family Licensing, and served as \nthe structural change necessary to help overcome significant communication and \ncoordination challenges previously experienced.  \n \nc.  The State designated a point person for each area office to focus on resource family \nrecruitment. \n \nBy the end of December 2006, DCF finalized the appointment of a full-time resource \ndevelopment person in each Area Office to serve as the point person to coordinate the \nrecruitment and licensing support work for that area. A job description dated January \n2007 for Resource Family Area Case Practice Specialists describes these point people’s \nprimary function as a liaison between resource family units and the Office of Licensing \nArea Inspector. They will be responsible for the overall outcomes of all recruitment, \nretention, development/licensing and support of the resource families in their respective \nAreas. They will also be responsible for monitoring the outcomes, compliance and \nsubmission of each Local Office’s monthly targets and for monitoring tracking reports of \ndata from resource family support workers’ home inspections. They will also make sure \nthat all resource families in their Area are assigned to a support worker and that all \ndatabases are accurately maintained. Many of the staff are newly appointed and, \ntherefore, not yet fully oriented to their roles.  The State will need to provide intensive \ntraining and support in the next few months on job functions and performance \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 40 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nexpectations in order for these new staff members to be effective in their jobs and to \ncreate a statewide learning network.  \n \nd.  The period for processing resource family applications is expected to take no more than \n150 days.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the State to process prospective resource \nfamilies through to licensure within 150 days of application (Section II.H.4).  DCF has \ndeveloped an implementation plan and process (see Table 4) that establishes \nresponsibilities with timeframes for actions so that an application can be expected to \nmove from receipt through to licensing within 150 days. This plan became operational at \nthe end of December 2006 and may be modified as the geographic impact teams \noperating in the Passaic and Atlantic Area Offices implement it and develop more \ninformation. The plan is a significant improvement over past practice in that it mandates \ncontinuous communication between the Office of Licensing and the resource family staff \nwithin DCF so that an application is not permitted to sit with unresolved issues in either \nthe resource family support unit or licensing units without joint problem-solving, an issue \nidentified as the primary cause of past backlogs. For example, under the new process, the \nhome inspection is done jointly between the licensing and resource support teams so that \nif small corrections are needed for a home to meet licensing standards, both offices are \naware and share the responsibility for addressing the licensing barriers.  This was not \nhow the system functioned in the past. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

Corzine    Page 42 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \ne.  The State created “Impact Teams” to address the backlog of homes waiting to be \nlicensed and to better assess the obstacles to prompt and effective licensing and support. \n \nIn September 2006, under the direction of the new Resource Family Director, DCF began \nto develop four Impact Teams: a licensing impact team (implemented October 2006), and \nteams in Middlesex (implemented November 2006), Passaic (implemented December \n2006), and Atlantic (implemented January 2007.) The Impact Teams are charged with: \n \n•  Completing a sample of the applications pending for more than 150 days from \nprocessing through licensing; \n•  Identifying potential structural challenges to completing licensing within 150 \ndays; and \n•  Providing assistance to support the State’s ability to meet the targets for new \nresource families. \n \nDCF plans to keep the Impact Teams in place until the majority of resource family home \napplications can be resolved in 150 days. \n  \nThe licensing team – the first team to begin work in October 2006 – is staffed with \nexperienced resource family central operations staff and senior licensing staff who now \nwork in the same geographic location. The team focused on a backlog of 189 home study \napplications that were languishing in the Office of Licensing.  Their work helped inform \nthe development of the newly-implemented process discussed above.  In addition, 75 \npercent (142) of the applications reviewed by the licensing Impact Team have been \nresolved:  94 families were licensed; 44 families have withdrawn from the process; and 4 \nfamilies were denied licenses.  DCF reports that the remaining 47 families have been \nassigned to an inspector for joint follow up by the Office of Licensing and Local Office \nResource Family staff.   \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 43 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nFrom their review of the 189 pending resource family applications, the licensing Impact \nTeam found critical gaps in communication between the field and licensing staff.  DCF \ntook an important step towards remedying this longstanding communications failure by \nshifting both the Office of Licensing and the Resource Family staff reporting to the \nResource Family Director.  Having both offices report to a single Director not only \ncommunicates a shared purpose but establishes a requirement for teamwork and has \ncreated incentives for eliminating communication and responsibility problems. \n \nDue to the Impact Team’s findings, DCF made the following positive changes:  \n•  Practical solutions such as providing needed equipment to licensing inspectors to \nhelp them resolve inspection violations such as lacking batteries for smoke \ndetectors or thermometers to take water temperature, etc. Similarly, resource \nfamily support workers now have the ability to supply homes with some of the \nsame equipment to resolve problems in advance of the inspection. \n•  Geographic assignments for licensing staff. Impact teams recommended that \nlicensing inspectors be linked to Local Offices to reduce travel time and expense, \na structural improvement that began in December 2006 along with the \nimplementation of the 150-day methodology. \n•  Process improvements, including establishing a statewide courier to deliver \ncompleted applications from the field to licensing, rather than by fax, a method \nthat DCF determined to be inefficient in a host of ways. \nThese improvements are positive; however, they are foundational and suggest that DCF \nis still in the initial stages of the diagnostic process. The only Impact Team that has been \noperational for any length of time is staffed by Central Office personnel. As DCF is \naware, capacity development for these issues needs to shift to the Area Offices. DCF also \nneeds to develop a process to systemically track recommendations and improvements. \nSince two of the Impact Teams have just been formed, it is too soon to know what \nadditional remedies will be required to address barriers they uncover as well as the extent \nto which the current improvements will have lasting influence statewide.  As seen in \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 44 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nFigure 8 below, early indications of progress are promising as net gains in the number of \nlicensed resource families have risen. \n \nf.  DCF ramped up its efforts to license resource family homes and is starting to show net \ngains. \n \nAs of December 2006, DCF reports it has a net gain of 209 licensed resource families \nduring CY 2006 (see Figure 7).  During this period, a total of 1,280 homes were licensed; \n1,071 are no longer active resource homes due to adoption, death or other reasons for \nclosure, leaving a net increase of 209 families. \n \nFigure 7:  Resource Families Licensed \nNet Gain/Losses by Month & Total \nCY 2006 \n250\n209\n200\ns\ne 150\nm\no\nH\nof \ner  100\nb\nm\nu\nN\nNet  50 35 32 44 39 35\n17 20\n11 8\n-30 -5 3\n0\n-5Ja0nuary February M arch April M ay June July AugustSepte m ber OctoberNove m ber Dece m ber T O T A L\nMonths\n \n Source:  DCF Office of Policy and Planning; includes both kinship and non-kinship homes, January \n2007. \n \nIn July 2006, DCF began to collect data to distinguish the number of kinship and non-kinship \nhomes licensed each month.

The State established monthly targets for the number of new resource families to be \nlicensed by each Local Office.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the State to have set Local Office targets \nfor the number of new resource families to license each month by December 2006 \n(Section II.H.7).  Table 6 shows the monthly targets that DCF established for each office \nin order for the State to reach the Modified Settlement Agreement’s overall target of \n1,030 new homes licensed by June 2007 (Section II.H.10). These targets, which were the \nresult of information on local capacity, serve primarily as a DCF management tool to \npromote and track performance.  They do not appear to be based on an assessment of \nareas of greatest need or the specific recruitment needs for target populations. The \nMonitor is confident that in reaching more permanent targets for each office, the State \nwill develop a system that takes into account specific Local Office needs and regional \ndifferences. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

Increasing the Resource Family Board Rate. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the State to close the gap between current resource \nfamily support rates (foster care, kinship care, and adoption subsidy) and the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture’s estimated costs of raising a child.  By January 2007, the State was \nexpected to raise rates sufficient to close the gap by 25 percent (Section II.H.15).  Table 7 below \nprovides the new rates, effective January 1, 2007. \n \nTable 7: \nDYFS Approved Resource Family Rates, \nEffective January 1, 2007 \nDifference between  Percentage of  Approved \nDYFS Rate  Revised USDA Rate  Approved  \nAge of  USDA 2005 Rate  increase required  Increase to \n12/31/06     CY 2005 (published  DYFS Rate \nChild  and DYFS Rate  to close gap 25%  Monthly \n(STEP 0)  April 2006)  1/1/07 \n12/31/06  by 1/1/07  Rate \n \n0-5  $497  $667  $170  33%  $56  $553 \n \n6-9  $534  $718  $184  33%  $61  $595 \n \n10-12  $557  $741  $184  33%  $61  $618 \n \n13-17  $609  $786  $177  33%  $58  $667 \n             \nSource:  DCF, DYFS. \n \n \n3.  Improving Access to Placements Available through the Division of Children’s \nBehavioral Health:  Real Time Bed Tracking.  \n \nIn accordance with the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.D.1), DCBHS instituted a \nreal time bed-tracking system, entitled “Bed-Tracking 2,” in September 2006 to more accurately \nidentify the number and type of specialty beds managed by the Value Options (the Contracted \nSystems Administrator – CSA), that are available for placement for children and youth.  The \npurpose of this change is to improve timely access to appropriate treatment alternatives for \nchildren by more easily identifying a program with an open bed with the capacity to meet the \nneeds of a specific child or youth.  In the past, children were typically referred to multiple \nprograms without any systematic means of identifying whether the program had an available \nvacancy.  \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 48 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nAccording to DCBHS, the Bed-Tracking 2 system provides: \n•  Real time bed availability \n•  Information about the number of children and youth waiting for out-of-home \ntreatment for specific levels of care \n•  Length of time a child/youth waits for placement—tracking time from referral to \nout-of-home placement \n•  Ability to track providers’ acceptance and non-acceptance rates \n•  Ability to track reasons children/youth are not accepted into programs \n•  Ability for case managers to view all referrals and admission status \n \nThrough this bed-tracking system, each program receives one referral at a time and must make a \ndecision on that referral before another child is referred to their program.  The child is also \nreferred to one program at a time; in this way fewer referral packets are created and potentially \nthere are fewer program interviews and rejections for the child/youth. \n \nThe real time bed-tracking system also helps DCBHS monitor treatment programs’ compliance \nwith their contract obligations.  For example, if DCBHS contracts with a program to provide \nservices to boys ages 12-17 who have a history of assaultive behavior and setting fires, but a \nprogram denies placement of a 16-year-old boy with this type of history, DCBHS can review the \ncontract obligation with the Director of the program.  Initial implementation of the system \ncreated some problems as providers needed to be sure that the information in the database about \ntheir program and capacities to provide services was correct and could be relied on by the CSA \nas an accurate screen for referrals.  While still relatively new, DCF believes this system will help \nreduce the number of children placed out-of-state and reduce vacancies in residential programs. \n  \n4.   Out-of-State Placement of Children.  \n \nConsistent with the DCF practice model and the desire to allow children in placement to \nmaintain contacts with their family and community, the Modified Settlement Agreement requires \nthe State to minimize the number of children who are placed in out-of-state congregate care \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 49 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nfacilities (Section II.D.2) and to bring children who are placed out-of-state back to New Jersey as \nsoon as they are ready to be “stepped down” (Section II.D.6).  While recognizing that some \nchildren’s treatment needs will be better served in out-of-state facilities, the State implemented a \nprocess to monitor and prevent the inappropriate use of such placements. \n \na.  To ensure that out-of-state congregate placement is only used when needed to meet a \nchild’s treatment needs, the State developed an administrative process to ensure that \nchildren and youth are not placed in out-of-state congregate care, unless certain \nexceptions are shown. \n \nThe CSA is responsible for identifying placements for children and youth requiring out-\nof-home treatment placements.   The CSA uses the Bed-Tracking 2 system previously \ndescribed to try to identify an appropriate placement in New Jersey.  The CSA \ndetermines if the child or youth requires out-of-home treatment placement based on an \nassessment.  Children and youth with highly specialized needs (such as those who set \nfires, those with a low IQ, those who exhibit sexual aggression, and cruelty to animals) \nare immediately referred to DCBHS’ Placement Services Unit (PSU).  The PSU worker \ncollaborates with the child’s team and Care Manager to identify in-state options.  If no in-\nstate option is available or appropriate for the needs of the child, the PSU worker will \nidentify out-of-state placement options as soon as possible.  For all other children and \nyouth, the CSA is initially responsible for identifying an available and appropriate \nplacement.  The CSA conducts a daily available placement search for seven days. After \nseven days, the PSU is alerted and acts in a consultative manner while the CSA continues \na daily search for an appropriate placement.  The PSU worker collaborates with the \ncaseworker to determine if adequate supports are available to treat and maintain the \nchild/youth in his/her current placement or at another in-state placement.  The PSU \nbegins to look for appropriate placements out-of-state when it is determined that no in-\nstate facility is available and the child’s present living situation cannot be maintained.  \nFigure 8 on the following page shows the DCBHS placement process. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 50 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nFigure 8: \nDCBHS Placement Process \nFor Children and Youth Requiring Treatment Providers \n \n \nCSA receives referral    \n  on child/youth. \nLevel of care determined. \n \n \n \n \nFor child/youth who do not  For child/youth who meet \n \nmeet specialty criteria.   “specialty” criteria, direct \n  Begin search for available  Day 1  referral to PSU for \nand appropriate specialty bed  placement. \n \nin NJ.

Corzine    Page 51 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe State also developed an internal process to ensure high-level review and approval for \ndecisions about placing a child/youth in an out-of-state treatment facility.  With input \nfrom the Monitor, the State drafted an approval form, which asks for and records \nappropriate documentation about the acceptable reasons for out-of-state placement (in \ncompliance with the Modified Settlement Agreement; Section II.D.2).  In order to be \napproved for out-of-state placement, the child/youth 1) must be placed in a facility that is \ncloser to his/her family than other appropriate in-state options, or 2) cannot be \nappropriately served by any in-state program and the out-of-state placement can \nappropriately meet treatment needs.  The PSU manager and DCBHS director are \nresponsible for ensuring that the PSU worker and case manager make every effort to find \nan appropriate in-state placement; the DCBHS Director has final approval for all out-of-\nstate placements.   \n \nTo verify that the State has implemented the process, the Monitor reviewed all out-of-\nstate placement approval forms signed by the DCBHS Director for the time period of \nOctober 2006-December 2006 (approximately 62 requests).  Several children/youth were \nplaced in out-of-state placement more accessible to their families than in-state options.  \nMany children/youth were placed out-of-state for multiple and complex factors such as \nan IQ below 75, fire-setting or aggressive behavior, a history of rejection from in-state \nprograms, sexual aggression, schizoaffective disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder.  \nA recent examination by DCBHS of the profiles of children/youth placed in-state and \nout-of-state for longer than six months found that low IQ and sexual aggression were \nsignificant factors in placing children/youth out-of-state.  The State is attempting to \naddress the need for more in-state treatment services by creating 60 new specialty beds \nfor children/youth who have some of the most common challenges of children placed \nout-of-state in the last six months – fire setting, low IQ (55-75), assaultive behavior, and \nsexual aggression. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued by DCBHS seeking in-state \nprogram bids for specialty services for boys and girls age 8-12 and 15-18 and for girls \nage 12-18 with the behaviors previously described and those with a history of running \naway from placement.  The RFP seeks programs that will adhere to a “no reject/no eject” \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 52 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \npolicy so that children/youth who meet a specific program’s criteria for treatment will be \naccepted in the program, and the program will not terminate the child/youth from the \nprogram before his/her treatment is complete. \n \nFor the most part, the Monitor found that PSU workers provided documentation with the \napproval form of the in-state programs that denied placement to the child/youth.  \nAlthough not required by the Modified Settlement Agreement, there was no \ndocumentation that the child’s/youth’s family was aware of the placement plans other \nthan through self-reporting by the PSU worker.  Additionally, some of the approval forms \nfailed to identify which agency or worker is ultimately responsible for the tasks in the \nplan to return the child/youth to the State of New Jersey.   \n \nFigure 9 shows the number of DCBHS authorized out-of-state placements for 2006 for all \nyouth served by DCBHS.  It is important to note that the Modified Settlement Agreement \nfocuses on developing adequate in-state services and placements only for children or \nyouth in DYFS custody (Section II.D.3), although obtaining adequate in-state services is \na DCF priority for all children served by DCBHS. \n \nFigure 9:  Out-of-State Placements \n2006 for All Youth Served by DCBHS \n340\n330\n325 327 326\n322 323 322\n320\nnts 314\nme 310\nPlace 304\ne  300\nat 297\nSt\nOut of  290 288 291\nof  280 280\nNo. \n270\n260\n250\nJan.

Eighty-nine percent (89%) of youth placed out-of-state since October 2006 \nwere treated within a 50 mile radius of New Jersey. \n \nTable 8:   \nNew Placements Out-of-State \n(October – December 2006) \n  Number of  Number   \n  Month  Out-of-State  Within 50 miles of  Number in \nPlacements  NJ  DYFS Custody \n       \nOctober 2006  13  11   5 \n \n       \nNovember 2006  28    26  9 \n \n       \nDecember 2006  21  18  7   \n \n       \nTotal  62  55  21 \n \n    Source:  New Jersey DCBHS \n \n \nb.  The state developed a methodology for identifying children in custody in out-of-state \ncongregate care who are potentially ready to return to New Jersey and step down to a \nlower level of care. \n \nIn accordance with the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.D.6), the State \ndeveloped an administrative process for identifying children/youth who are placed out-of-\nstate and who may be ready to return to New Jersey and “step down” to a lower level of \ncare.   \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 54 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n \nEvery month, DCBHS generates a list of children/youth placed out-of-state and \nhighlights those who may be appropriate for step down.  Youth are identified for step \ndown by consensus of the case manager, provider, and CSA, or if the child’s length of \nstay exceeds one standard deviation of the mean length of stay.  Every 90 days, each of \nthe three staff members involved is expected to indicate on the electronic treatment plan \nwhether the child/youth is ready to be discharged from the current program and stepped \ndown.  When any one of the three parties directly involved in the child/youth’s care – the \ncase manager, the provider or the CSA – feel that the child/youth is step-down ready, s/he \nis placed on a “three button” report generated by DCBHS.  DCBHS team leaders consult \ndirectly with the case management entity to explore if the child/youth is step-down ready \nand, if so, to identify barriers, action steps and strategies for transitioning youth.   \n \n5.    Youth in Juvenile Detention Post-Disposition. \n \na.  The State developed an automated system for tracking youth in juvenile detention \nfacilities post-disposition and awaiting placement. \n \nA longstanding problem is the continued placement of children/youth in juvenile \ndetention facilities post-disposition – youth who remain in these detention facilities solely \nbecause they are awaiting an appropriate placement.  One of the barriers to moving \nchildren/youth out of detention quickly was the lack of a systematic process to identify \nand track youth and to use information about their needs to identify appropriate \nresources.  Through the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.D.3), the State \ncommitted to implement an automated system by December 2006 to identify youth in \nDYFS custody being held in juvenile detention facilities post-disposition and to ensure \nthat each youth is appropriately placed within 30 days of disposition. \n \nThe automated system was pilot-tested in the spring 2006 and was fully operational by \nthe early fall 2006.  DYFS court liaisons and key staff from the Case Management \nOrganizations (CMOs) and Youth Case Management Organizations (YCMs) received \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 55 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \ntraining by the Central Office staff on how to use an electronic tracking form.  Tracking \nand processes put in place to find appropriate placements produced the desired outcome.  \nBased on DCF data for children/youth in DYFS custody in detention post-disposition in \nJanuary 2007, no child waited more than 30 days for a placement.  In subsequent months, \nthese data will be examined by the Monitor to ensure that the results are maintained. \n \n6.  DCF Incorporated the Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) to Investigate \n  Allegations of Maltreatment for Children in Placement. \n \nThe new DCF organization includes the Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU), which \nwas formerly housed under DHS (Section II.I.1).  IAIU is responsible for investigating \nallegations of abuse and neglect in any out-of-home care setting.  This includes foster care \nplacement settings as well as correctional, detention and treatment facilities, schools (public or \nprivate), residential schools, shelters, hospitals, camps or day care centers that are licensed or \nshould be licensed, resource family homes and registered family day care homes. 8 In 2006, IAIU \nreceived 3,777 referrals. \n \nTo date, the organizational structure of IAIU has not changed since its move to DCF.  It is \ncomprised of a Central Office and four regional investigative offices – Northern, Southern, \nCentral and Metropolitan.  A Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) unit is part of the Central \nOffice organization.  The purpose of IAIU’s investigative effort is to determine whether children \nin out-of-home care settings have been abused or neglected9 and to ensure their safety by \nrequiring corrective actions to eliminate the risk of future harm.  IAIU leadership reports that all \nof the investigators will receive the First Responder training by June 2007.  The IAIU \nsupervisors are also attending the DYFS supervisor training. In the coming months, DCF \nleadership intends to focus more attention on the scope, organization, and staffing of IAIU and \nduring the next monitoring period, the Monitor will more fully assess IAIU operations. \n                                                 \n8 DYFS (7-1-1992).

Corzine    Page 56 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n \nVI.  MEETING THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF \nCHILDREN AND YOUTH \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement emphasizes the important and urgent need for DCF to do a \nbetter job meeting the health and mental health needs of children and youth in their care and \nrequires the State by June 2007, to have developed a statewide coordinated system of health care \nfor children and youth in out-of-home care.  The Commissioner and his staff committed to \ndeveloping and implementing a new comprehensive medical health care model for children and \nyouth in care that will provide for a pre-placement assessment, comprehensive medical \nexaminations within 60 days of a child entering care (similar to the current CHEC model, which \nprovides for a 4-6 hour physical, developmental, and mental health assessment), a case \nmanagement component that ensures children/youth who require follow up care receive these \nservices, and annual medical and dental check-ups.  Further, the medical care model will ensure \nthat all children in care have some type of medical passport that follows them in placement and \nprovides continuity of care when they return home or move to a permanent placement.  \n \nAt this point, the State is undertaking a variety of activities to assess the current delivery of \nhealth care services and to seek input on the design of the new model.  Activities to date include \ndiscussions with Medicaid and Department of Health staff; meetings with key stakeholders \nincluding nurses currently contracted to provide some of the pre-placement exams in non-\nemergency room settings and monitor medically fragile children; and discussions with existing \nCHEC facilities and providers.  State staff are assessing whether there are additional potential \nhealth care resources and data tracking capacities available through the Federally Qualified \nHealth Centers (FQHCs) that exist across the State.  Over the next three to six months, the \nMonitor will work closely with DCF officials as they complete their analysis and develop more \nspecific ideas and implementation plans for an improved medical care system for the \nchildren/youth in their care. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 57 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n1.  Assessment of DCBHS System of Care. \n \nUnder the Modified Settlement Agreement, the State committed to complete an assessment, by \nDecember 2006, of the continuum of services needed to best meet the needs of children and \nfamilies served by DCBHS (Section II. C.1). This assessment is intended to inform the \ndevelopment of mental health and behavioral health care services over the next few years.   \n \nTwo reports recently completed have provided DCBHS with insight into their current array of \nservices for children and families.  The reports include an assessment of the New Jersey \nChildren’s Behavioral Health Care System, dated October 2006.  This report was commissioned \nin response to a recommendation of a Task Force on Mental Health Services, established by \nGovernor Codey in 2004 and was conducted by the University of South Florida.10  The report \nprovides a broad evaluation of how the current child behavioral health system functions and \noffers recommendations for continued improvement.  Service need was one area that this report \nexplored.  The researchers recommended the development of specialty services for children with \ndual diagnoses (mental health and developmental delays) and children with a history of setting \nfires or sexual aggression.  As mentioned previously, DCF recently issued an RFP for specialty \nservices to meet the needs of these children.  The report also includes recommendations about \nspecific ways to improve assessments, governance structures of the system of care, and \ninvolvement of families in all levels of decision making. \n \nDCF commissioned another study11 to create empirically grounded estimates of the continuum of \nservices needed to meet the treatment needs of children and adolescents accessing treatment in \nNew Jersey’s System of Care.  Dr. John Lyons of Northwestern University’s Mental Health \nServices and Policy Program conducted this study.  Dr. Lyons analyzed data on service needs \nand experiences of children and youth currently in the system to estimate what quantity of \n                                                 \n10 Final Report:  Independent Assessment of New Jersey’s Children’s Behavioral Health Care System, October 5, \n2006, Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, University of South Florida, October 5, 2006. \n \n11 Empirically Estimating the Level and Type of Behavioral Health Services Required to Meet the Needs of Children \nand Families in New Jersey’s System of Care, New Jersey Department of Children and Families Division of Child \nBehavioral Health Services, December 2006.  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 58 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nservices are needed at the various levels of care.  His overall conclusion, which mirrored an \nearlier DCBHS needs assessment using a completely different methodology, was that “youth \nmay be well-served at more community integrated levels of care than the System of Care \ncurrently provides.”12  The implication of this assessment is that additional treatment home \ncapacity is needed and that the Department needs to develop a clear model and delivery system \nfor treatment foster care. \n \nIn addition to the formal reports, the DCBHS Director sponsored a series of public meetings \naround the State to gain input on the DCBHS System of Care and future strategic directions. \nDCF leadership and the DCBHS Director are now using the findings of these reports and their \nassessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing system to decide next steps.  Options \nunder consideration include administrative changes, changes to the System of Care case \nmanagement functions and providers and the development of new service models, including a \nclinical model for treatment foster care. \n \n2.  DCF Hired a Chief Medical Officer. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the new Department of Children and Families to \nhire a new Chief Medical Officer by August 2006 (Section II.F.1).  A Chief Medical Officer, a \npediatrician with expertise in epidemiology was hired June 1, 2006.  The Chief Medical Officer \nis responsible for providing individual case consultation, approving the administration of \npsychotropic drugs, and emergency consultation.  Other duties include conferring with DCF \nsenior staff on health and health care issues, reviewing and creating policies and procedures \nrelated to health care issues and services, supervising the nursing unit, and participating in the \nChild Fatality and Near Fatality Board reviews.   \n \n                                                 \n12\n Ibid., p. 2.   \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 59 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n3.  Pre-Placement Medical Assessment. \n \nDCF data support that all children entering out-of-home care are routinely receiving pre-\nplacement assessment, but there is wide variability in the extent to which they are performed in \nnon-emergency settings, in what the examination entails, and in who sees the child (Nurses or \nDoctors).  The goal of the pre-placement assessment is to perform a quick check-up of the child, \nassess for any communicable diseases, and determine any medication that may need to be \ncontinued or administered. \n \nUnder the Modified Settlement Agreement, all children entering placement are expected to have \na pre-placement medical assessment in a setting other than an emergency room (Section II.F.2).  \nRemoval of children from their homes is always a traumatic experience, and the intent of this \nrequirement is not to add to the trauma by subjecting a child to examination in a hospital \nemergency facility.   The Modified Settlement Agreement establishes progressive targets for \nmeeting this goal.  Beginning January 2007, 70 percent of children entering out-of-home care are \nto have their assessment in a setting other than an emergency room; by June 2007, the target is \nraised to 90 percent of children.  According to DCF data, 67 percent of children received pre-\nplacement assessment in non-emergency settings in October 2006 and 70 percent in November \n2006.  December 2006 data are not yet available. \n \nDCF leadership is focusing on pre-placement assessments in its work with Local Offices, \nthrough data collection and tracking as well as through individual problem solving to address \nbarriers. Because of unique county characteristics, there is no “one-size fits all” solution to \nproviding pre-placement assessments.  However, the Central Office has worked with Local and \nArea Offices to find solutions to reduce the number of emergency room pre-placement \nassessments in non-emergency room settings.  For example, in Essex County, there was a \nsignificant problem of workers taking children to emergency rooms for assessments after \nbusiness hours.  The Central Office collaborated with nurses in Essex County, and a nurse now is \navailable to provide pre-placement assessments at a local clinic from 7-11:00 pm.  This strategy \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 60 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nwill be evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing the use of emergency rooms setting for these \nassessments. \n \n4.  Data on Health Care Services. \n \nNew Jersey law and policy requires the State provide children entering out-of-home care with \npre-placement assessments, full medical exams within 60 days of entering out-of-home care, \nannual medical exams in accordance with EPSDT guidelines, semi-annual dental exams for \nchildren age 3 years and older, mental health assessments, and all identified follow-up care.  \nRecognizing that DCF had much work to create the service and data tracking systems to ensure \nappropriate delivery of health care services, the Modified Settlement Agreement requires that in \n2006, the State shall provide such care to the best of its ability and document provisions of such \ncare (Section II.F.2).  Using data collected in 2006, by April 2007, the State and the Monitor will \ndevelop both the baseline and future performance targets for improved health care delivery. \n  \nDCF gathered data from a variety of sources to inform the upcoming work to establish a baseline \nfor provision of medical and dental services for 2007 and thereafter.  Data sources include a \nrandom statewide sample of 260 children in care for one year and a random statewide sample of \n294 children in care during the months of April – June 2006.   Other data sources being reviewed \ninclude data extracts from the Quality Service Reviews (QSR) and Child and Family Service \nReview (CFSR) performed in 2005 and 2006, a 2005 report by the Office of the Child Advocate \non CHEC examinations and follow-up health care and CHEC provider reports.  The DCF senior \nstaff are in the process of analyzing these data.  DCF intends to collaborate with the Office of the \nChild Advocate to review these data and will work with the Court Monitor to set the baseline and \nestablish future performance targets. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 61 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nVIII.  PERMANENCY PLANNING AND ADOPTION \n \nAlong with assuring children’s safety, child welfare agencies must work vigilantly to provide \nevery child with a chance to live and thrive in a family, whether their own through safe \nreunification, an adoptive family, or in the permanent legal custody of an appropriate kinship \nfamily.  In New Jersey, as in other states, too many children have languished in foster care \nwithout the attainment of a permanent home. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the implementation of a new permanency practice \nin DYFS to make sure decisions about children’s lives are timely and appropriate and are carried \nout through high quality reunification, permanency and adoption practices across the State.  \nDuring this monitoring period, the State was to reconstitute adoption units within Local Offices \nand assign children with a permanency goal of adoption to adoption workers with the capacity \nand expertise to assure them permanent families.  In addition, the State was to develop and begin \nimplementing a series of practices to promote permanency from the first day that a child enters \nDCF custody.  The Modified Settlement Agreement requirements for this monitoring period \nrelated to permanency planning and adoption are discussed below. \n \n1.  DYFS Created Adoption Units in Local Offices and Successfully Transitioned Cases of \nChildren with a Permanency Goal of Adoption to Adoption Workers. \n \nFor nearly 20 years, Adoption Resource Centers (ARCs) were responsible for ensuring timely \nfinalization of adoption for children and youth in New Jersey.  While the ARC system had \nseveral strengths, due to significant administrative complications, numerous children and youth \nwith the goal of adoption were delayed in having their cases transferred to the ARCs.  Under the \noriginal Settlement Agreement of 2003, the ARCs were dismantled with the intent that \npermanency workers with the assistance of adoption specialists would handle all adoption cases.  \nThis restructuring proved challenging, due in part to the lack of adoption expertise of \npermanency workers, high caseloads, and the failure to preserve and/or build adoption expertise \nin the newly-created adoption specialist positions.  Beginning in 2006, adoption units were \ncreated in all Local offices with the exception of Newark, which has an adoption office that \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 62 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nhandles the finalization of adoptions for children from three local Newark offices.  At the end of \nDecember 2006, 81 percent of children statewide with a goal of adoption, were transferred and \nbeing served by adoption workers.  Non-adoption permanency workers still carry some cases of \nchildren moving toward adoption but DCF staff report that based on their interactions with Local \nOffices, in most instances these specific situations are exceptions allowed by the Modified \nSettlement Agreement, due to previously-established relationships with the permanency workers.  \nThus, in the Monitor’s view, the Department is meeting the Modified Settlement Agreement \nrequirement (Section II.G.9) that children with a permanency goal of adoption be assigned to \nqualified adoption workers. \n \nDesignated adoption workers exist for each Local Office, and cases are to be transferred to them \nwithin five days of a child’s permanency hearing.  Concurrent planning specialists have been \nhired to support adoption practice in all Area Offices.  These specialists provide expertise in \nconcurrent planning practice, assist with decisions made on cases, track progress towards \nadoption, and monitor compliance with 5-month and 10-month review hearing protocols.  \nCurrently, as required by the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.G.9), a three-day \ntraining session is provided to all new adoption workers (the New Adoptive Worker Training).  \nThe Office of Adoption Operations is responsible for conducting this training.  DCF trained 91 \nnew and existing adoption workers by December 2006 in training held in Monmouth, Camden \nand Middlesex counties; 51 additional workers were trained in January 2007 in training held in \nEssex and Ocean counties.  According to the State, all adoption workers have received the New \nAdoptive Worker Training (a curriculum modified from the original ARC training) at some point \nover the last several years.  The Office of Adoption Operations sends rosters of trained adoption \nworkers to NJWTA, which maintains the information in a statewide database.  The Monitor has \nnot independently verified these data and will do so in the next monitoring period. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

The State Finalized the Adoption of 1,387 Children in Calendar Year 2006, Exceeding \nthe Modified Settlement Agreement Target of 1,100 Adoptions. \n \nThis is an extremely positive and noteworthy accomplishment, which reflects the hard and \nfocused efforts of individuals at all levels of DCF, working in cooperation with resource families \nand Judges across the State. \n \nFigure 10 below provides historical data on the number of adoptions finalized in Calendar Years \n2002 through 2006. \nFigure 10:  Number of Adoptions Finalized in \nCY 2002 through 2006 \n1,500\n1,418\ns 1,400\nn\no\nti 1,266 1,387\np\no 1,300\nd 1,315\nA\nd \ne 1,200\nz\ni\nal\nn\nFi 1,100\nf \no\no. \nN 1,000 1,014\n900\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nCalendar Years\n \nSource:  New Jersey DCF, February 2007. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 64 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n3.  The State Created Adoption Impact Teams. \n \nIn December 2006, DYFS created Adoption Impact Teams (under the direction of the statewide \nAdoption Director) to find permanent homes for the 100 longest-waiting youth as of November \n2006 who are legally free with adoption as their permanency goal.  The children on the list are \nprimarily teenage African American males.  The Adoption Impact Teams consist of five DYFS \nemployees experienced in adoption recruitment or placement work.  Impact Team staff are \nphysically located around the State in areas with the highest number of waiting children but are a \npart of the Central Office of Adoption Operations.  The Impact Team members (also referred to \nas Impact recruiters) are charged with assisting the longest waiting children but also with \nidentifying common barriers to adoption and developing strategies to address them.  Team \nmembers will receive additional child-specific recruitment training in early summer 2007.  \n \nEach Impact recruiter is assigned to work with approximately 20 youth in concert with the \nchild’s Adoption worker and the child.   The children will be featured in the 2007 Heart Gallery \nof New Jersey, a recruitment program where children available for adoption have their pictures \ntaken by professional photographers.  Recruitment supervisors will review the efforts of the \nImpact recruiters on a monthly basis.  Impact Team members will meet once a month for \ntraining, brainstorming and to share resources.  \n \nIn addition, the State has designated 13 child-specific recruiters to work with the twelve Area \nOffices to find adoptive placements for children who are legally free for adoption but with no \nadoptive home identified.13  These 13 child-specific recruiters and the five Impact recruiters \nreceived child-specific recruitment training in the summer 2006.  DCF plans to provide this \ngroup with ongoing training in 2007. \n                                                 \n13 The Middlesex/Monmouth Area Office has two assigned child-specific recruiters. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 65 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n4.  DCF Developed Plans to Address the Adoption Backlog in Local Offices with the \nHighest Numbers of Children Awaiting an Adoptive Home.   \n \nDespite the positive work and adoption outcomes this year, DCF continues to face a great \nchallenge in reducing the “backlog” of cases where children are legally free for adoption, but the \nadoption has not been finalized.  As of December 31, 2006, there remain 1,919 children who are \nlegally free whose adoption has not been finalized.  This number declined from 2,260 children in \nJanuary 2006 to 2,154 children in September 2006, to 1,919 children in December 2006.  \nFigure 11 below shows DCF data on the status of the 1919 legally free children awaiting \nadoption as of December 31, 2006. As illustrated, at least 402 children require adoptive home \nrecruitment; over 1,100 children are awaiting completion of a home study and finalized adoption \npacket for an already identified resource, and slightly more than 300 children are awaiting a \ncourt hearing to finalize their adoption. \n \nFigure 11: \nNJDCF \nLegally Free Children Awaiting Adoption \nAs of December 2006 Total = 1919 \nAwaiting Court \nHearing\n17%\nAwaiting Decision by \nCurrent Foster/Kinship \nFamily\n3%\nAwaiting Home Study \nAwaiting Adoptive  & Packet Finalization\nHome 59%\n21%\n \nSource:  DCF, December 2006. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 66 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nIn order to better understand the delays in adoption, each Local Office was asked to assess \nbarriers for backlogged cases in which a child was legally free for more than 90 days, and not in \na finalized adoption. \n \nThe assessment of the “Adoption Backlog” was completed in September 2006, at which time  \nLocal Offices reported that there were 1,113 legally free children and youth waiting more than \n90 days for a finalized adoptive home.  Three hundred ten (35%) of the children were in Essex \nCounty and an additional 119 (11%) children in Union County.  The Local Offices identified \ntimely completion of consent materials as the principal barrier to adoption for almost 40 percent \nof these cases.  Table 10 below shows the number of cases identified by their principal barrier. \n \nTable 10:  Principal Barrier to Adoption for Legally Free Children \nWaiting More than 90 Days* \n(September 2006) \n   \nPrimary Barrier  No. of Cases \n \n   \nTimely Completion of Consent Materials  442 \n   \nCompletion of Home Study  280 \n   \nCompletion of ICPC (out-of-state) Study  37 \n   \nCriminal History/Child Abuse Clearance (CHRI/CARI issue)  61 \n   \nRequire Facilitation of Decision Making   96 \non Adoption Plan \n   \nRequire Recruitment of an Adoptive Home  197 \n   \n        TOTAL:  1113** \nSource:  DYFS Local Office Assessments \n*Staff were to identify primary barrier per case although a case could have more than one barrier.   \n**As of September 2006, the total number of legally free children was 2,154 although by December \n2006, it dropped to 1,919 (see Figure 12) and by January 2007, is reported to be at 1,861 children.  \nAccording to Office of Adoptions Operations, the difference between 2,154 children legally free for \nadoption in September 2006 and the 1,113 children assessed for barriers is accounted for as follows:  550 \nchildren were placed in adoptive homes and 491 children were legally free less than 90 days or were in \nthe final stages of the adoptions process. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 67 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nBased on these assessments, the Office of Adoption Operations is working with the Local \nOffices to create strategies to alleviate the primary barriers identified.  Specifically, four counties \n(Essex, Union, Ocean and Burlington) required additional resources to assist in preparing the \nadoption consent materials. DYFS has since designated one-half of its federal Adoption \nIncentive Award ($243,000) to support “adoption expeditors” who will write child summaries, \nassemble necessary packets, write court reports, and perform other administrative tasks.  These \nexpeditors, under contract with the Children’s Home Society, are scheduled to operate from \nJanuary 22, 2007 through September 30, 2007.  The number of expeditors assigned per county is: \nEssex (4), Union (2), Ocean (1), and Burlington (1). The primary barrier identified in Middlesex \nCounty was the completion of the home study and, thus, the plan for those Local Offices is to \nhave the completion of these studies become part of the resource family Impact Team process. \n \n5.  Increasing Staff Supports to Facilitate Adoption Activities. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the State, by December 2006, to increase staff \nsupport in two specific ways to promote successful adoption outcomes.  The first is to designate \na resource family recruiter in each Local Office to conduct child-specific recruitment for children \nwith a goal of adoption awaiting families (Section II.G.8.  The second is to provide paralegal \nsupport and child summary writer support for adoption staff in Local Offices (Section II.G.5).  \nDCF fulfilled these requirements to support staff in finding homes for children awaiting adoption \nand in addressing the paperwork necessary to complete the adoption process. \n \nAs of December 2006, the State designated a resource family recruiter for each Area Office to \nconduct child-specific recruitment for children with a goal of adoption who are waiting for \nfamilies.  To support their work, the State developed a “Child-Specific Recruitment Plan” form.  \nThis form is designed to guide the recruitment team (permanency/adoption worker, supervisor, \nand recruiter) in their work with children who are not yet legally free and with children who are \nlegally free.  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 68 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe State also hired paralegals and child case summary writers to support the Local Office \nadoption staff.  There are currently 73 paralegals in the Local Offices who formerly had been \ncontract employees but were made State employees with the creation of DCF.  Contracts exist \nfor 55 additional temporary paralegal positions; some of which may be converted to full-time \nstate employees.  Thirty-six of the 55 positions are currently filled. Finally, DCF contracted for \n23 child care summary writers in various Local Offices; five were recently placed in offices that \nneeded the most help. \n \n6.  DCF is Working to Implement an Adoption Tracking System That Sets and Monitors \nAdoption Targets.  An Adoption Tracking Form Was Created That Requires Local \nOffices to Evaluate Their Milestones and Finalizations in Adoption on a Monthly \nBasis and Forecast Milestones and Finalizations for the Next Month. \n \nThe Office of Adoption Operations sends out a monthly Adoption Milestone and Forecasting \nReport to each Local Office. The report identifies adoption placements and finalizations \nachieved that month.  If the milestones achieved fall below the number forecasted, the Local \nOffice is directed to predict, on a case-level basis, the new projected date for the milestone to be \nachieved and provide an explanation for the delay.  By collecting this information from the Local \nOffice on a monthly basis, DYFS leadership believes more accurate targets are set and there is \ngreater accountability for work toward completion. The data collection tool requires the Local \nOffices to actively monitor the status of each adoption case. \n \nIn addition, the State has designed an automated Adoption Process Tracking form called the \nDYFS Concurrent Planning Tracking Tool.  The tracking form is filled out by the concurrent \nplanning specialist with information obtained from the SIS and NJ SPIRIT systems and from \ncaseworkers. While the form as developed satisfies the Modified Settlement Agreement \nrequirement to track completion of key permanency planning and adoption milestones as \noutlined in Section II.G.4., it does not, in the Monitor’s view, adequately support the \nDepartment’s concurrent planning focus.  Specifically, any reference to reunification as a goal is \nmissing.  In order to align with the values and goals of concurrent planning, the Monitor \nencourages DYFS to consider also tracking data relevant to successful family reunification. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 69 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n7.  By December 2006, the State of New Jersey Designed a Concurrent Planning Model to \nbe Demonstrated in Ten Sites That Includes 5- and 10-Month Permanency Reviews. \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement requires the Department to improve concurrent permanency \nplanning and adoption practice (Section II.G.1 and 2).  Particularly, DYFS must begin the \nprocess earlier of identifying and supporting permanent living arrangements for children and \nyouth who are unable to reunify with their parents.  In response to this goal, DYFS created a new \nConcurrent Planning “Enhanced Review” Model for implementation in 10 demonstration sites \nbeginning January 2007.  This Model outlines the key meetings at various stages of case \nprocessing and provides checklists for workers delineating their permanency planning \nresponsibilities at each point in the life of a case. \n \nThe concurrent planning focus begins when a child enters out-of-home placement and requires a \npre-placement conference within 72 hours of a child’s removal.  Participants in this meeting \ninclude the casework supervisor, supervisor, caseworker, parents and other interested parties.  \nThe purpose of this meeting is to begin family engagement and a “full disclosure” discussion. \nPlacement options for the child are discussed, relatives identified, and visitation is planned.  \n \nThe Model also includes a 30-day supervisory review (that ensures that the case plan developed \naddresses the need for placement and that the concurrent planning process has begun) and a 90-\nday staff review to examine the likelihood of reunification and assess the steps made toward \npermanency, including the appropriateness of the child’s current placement as a permanent \nplacement.  \n \nFor children remaining in care, the Model includes the enhanced review at five months.  This \nreview involves the administrative placement reviewer, area concurrent planning specialist, \nsupervisor, caseworker, parents, child (if age appropriate), caregivers, and other interested \nparties.  According to the Model, this review will “focus on progress made in achieving the case \nplan, including the completion of key permanency tasks (such as searches for missing parents); \nreview parent’s compliance with services and progress towards reunification; review the \neffectiveness of services already provided and identify additional service needs of the child, \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 70 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nfamily or resource family; review the appropriateness and stability of the child’s placement and \nverify that the home is licensed.  This review is also meant to facilitate the identification of cases \nfor early reunification, early adoption or Kinship Legal Guardianship.”14  \n \nFor children remaining in care at 10 months, there is a required placement review to be held in \npreparation for the permanency hearing in court. After this review, a decision is made to either \nprovide more time for reunification to the parent(s) because of improved circumstances and \nlikelihood of reunification (an exception to ASFA) or to recommend the Termination of Parental \nRights (TPR).  This review has two parts—a family discussion (involving the family, \ncaseworker, supervisor, casework supervisor, caretaker, and other interested parties) and a \nlitigation conference involving casework and legal staff as preparation for moving forward with \nKinship Legal Guardianship or Termination of Parental Rights.  If a decision is made to change \nthe child’s goal to adoption, an adoption worker is assigned to the case, but does not formally \ntake on the case until after the permanency hearing.  The permanency worker is responsible for \nintroducing the adoption worker to the child and caregiver.  Any remaining tasks required to be \ncompleted by the permanency worker before the permanency hearing are identified at this time.   \nAfter the post-permanency hearing, the case is required to be transferred to the adoption worker \nwithin five days and a child-specific recruitment plan must be completed within 30 days.  A \nguardianship petition (the Termination of Parental Rights petition) must be filed within 45 days \nof the permanency hearing.  Missing from this Model is the requirement to assign a recruiter for \nchildren moving toward adoption who lack an identified adoptive home (Section II.G.2.b.iv).  \n \nThe Concurrent Planning Model as described meets nearly all of the requirements for a \npermanency planning process laid out in the Modified Settlement Agreement (Section II.G.2a-f).  \nState policy requires that the consent package for the adoption of children by foster or relative \nparents be completed within 90 days after parental rights are terminated (Section II.G.2.e).15  \nFurther, DCF is required to hold monthly reviews with the adoption worker, supervisor and Area \nOffice to evaluate the progress on identifying an adoptive family (Section II.G.2.f).  The \nrequirements are included in the job descriptions of the adoption specialists, concurrent planning \n                                                 \n14 DYFS Draft Concurrent Planning Handbook, December 2006. \n15 Field Operations Casework Policy and Procedures Manual, Sections 1208.10 and 1209.1. \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 71 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nspecialists and child-specific recruiters for the 100 longest-waiting children.  They are not yet \nestablished in policy as the Department is anticipating that changes will be made as a result of \nthe pilot sites’ experience.  After the concurrent planning model is tested and refined, DYFS \nintends to locate all of the relevant requirements and responsibilities in one document (e.g., the \nconcurrent planning policy manual) and in relevant policy. \n \nThe Monitor has encouraged DCF to review the concurrent planning processes for congruence \nwith the newly developed Case Practice Model.  The concurrent planning model specifically \ninvolves families at three different reviews (the pre-placement, 5-Month, and 10-Month).  The \ndemonstration sites should be encouraged to hold family team meetings at all key decision points \nin addition to the specified reviews. \n \nTen demonstration sites were selected for implementation of the new permanency practices \nbased on the local leadership’s interest, a strong foundation for family engagement, and \ngeographic diversity.  These demonstrations sites are Bergen South, Passaic North, Hudson \nCentral, Sussex, Essex North, Somerset, Monmouth North, Mercer North, Atlantic and Salem \ncounties. \n \nBecause the concurrent planning model represents a significant change in practice for staff, \nDYFS leadership intends to work intensively with participating offices.  DYFS has filled all the \nconcurrent planning and adoption positions in these sites.  Further, DYFS has contracted with \ntwo of the concurrent planning trainers to serve as coaches to the concurrent planning specialists \nto help build skills in areas such as having “full disclosure” conversations with parents.   The \nprogress of these 10 demonstration sites will be evaluated in six months.  Expanding the \nimplementation of the model to the rest of the State will happen after the model is evaluated and \nrefined.   \n \nDCF and DYFS leadership plan to meet with judges and resource family constituencies about the \nrevised permanency planning practices and the expectations of demonstration sites.  Additional \nresources will be allocated to these sites to be used for local contracts, which will provide \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 72 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nsupport to staff on clinical skills necessary for good family engagement.  The contract agency \nmay also be responsible for some family team meetings and provide increased visitation services \nfor families. \n \n \nVIII.  ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF \nACCURATE DATA \n \nThroughout this report, a consistent theme is the Department’s work to generate timely and \naccurate data and to use that information for planning and management purposes.  The effective \nuse of data for communications and for accountability is a priority strategy for the Departmental \nleadership. The Modified Settlement Agreement reinforces this interest in several ways, \nincluding:  \n•  The development and publication of accurate data on key indicators of system \nperformance; \n•  The system-wide use of management reporting based on the “Safe Measures” \nreporting system; and  \n•  Continued work to develop, test and implement New Jersey SPIRIT – the State's \nautomated child welfare information system (SACWIS). \n \nEach of these is discussed separately below:  \n \n1.  DCF Developed and Published on Its Website an Initial Set of Performance Indicators \nand Continues to Expand and Refine Its Presentation of Accurate Data. \n \nBeginning in August 2006, the Modified Settlement Agreement required the State to identify an \ninitial set of indicators, ensure the accuracy of those indicators, and to publish the indicator data \n(II.J.1).  It further requires the State to progressively increase the number of indicators for which \nit can provide accurate data to the public (II.J.3). \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 73 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nThe DCF website (www.state.nj.us/dcf)  now publishes data, at least quarterly on the following \nindicators: \n \n•  Demographic Data \no  Licensed Foster and Adoptive Families \no  Child Caseload \no  Placement Caseload \no  Children in Out-of-State Placement \no  Families under DYFS Supervision \no  Comparison of Children Entering and Exiting Out-of-Home Care \no  Age of Children in DYFS Out-of-Home Placement \no  Hotline Referrals \no  Child Protective Referrals by Source \no  Family Service Requests by Source \n \n•  Child Behavioral Health Data \no  DCBHS Authorized Out-of-State Placements \n \n•  Workforce and Caseload Data \no  Staff Trained \no  Separation Rate for Caseload Carrying Staff \no  Intake Caseloads \no  Permanency Caseloads \no  Caseload by DYFS Local Office \n \n•  Outcome Data \no  Adoptions – Comparative Data from 2000 to 2006 \no  Finalized Adoptions as of January 2007 \no  Subsidized Adoptions – Comparative Data from 2000 to 2006 \no  Total Legally Free Children Awaiting Adoption \no  Longitudinal Data from the Chapin Hall Center for Children \n(cid:131)  Length of Stay for Children in Out-of-Home Placement \n(cid:131)  Re-entry to Out-of-Home Care \n(cid:131)  Siblings Placed Together \n \nDCF has progressively added indicators and continues to move forward to increase the range, \naccuracy and timeliness of its indicator reporting.  The Monitor suggests that the next set of high \npriority indicators to be added to the website include:    \n•  Demographic Data \no  Children’s demographics (e.g. sex, race, age) for in-home and out-of-home cases \no  Reasons for entering and exiting out-of-home care \no  Type of placements \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 74 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \n \n•  State Central Register (SCR) Referral Data \no  Type and disposition of referrals \no  Outcomes of investigations/assessments \no  Timeliness of investigations/assessments \n \n•  IAIU Investigations Data \no  New investigations \no  Pending investigations \no  Backlog  \n \nUltimately, the Department’s goal is to publish accurate and timely data not only on process \nindicators but on outcomes for the children and families it serves. \n \n2.  “Safe Measures” is Accessible to All Staff and All Staff Are Trained to Use the System  \n \nBy September 2006, the Department was to initiate management reporting based on the “Safe \nMeasures” system (Section II.J.2 and II.E.4).  “Safe Measures” is an automated case tracking \nand workflow tool that is now accessible to all staff and can be used by both staff and managers \nto monitor their workload and track case status and progress.  Each DYFS staff member can \ngenerate reports from “Safe Measures” from their own desk-top computers.  The DCF “Safe \nMeasures’ Team trained all the existing staff in how to use the system.  It can be used to look at \ncaseload assignments and completion of key case-processing activities, such as case plan \ndevelopment, monthly visits with families etc.  Actual use varies both by worker and by office \nmanagers.  Some use it frequently and effectively; those who do use it find it to be a very user-\nfriendly and useful tool.  Workers are identifying and correcting data input errors in the SIS \nsystem as a result of using “Safe Measures.”  \n \n3.  The State Is Making Progress and Is on Track for Implementation of New Jersey SPIRIT.  \n \nOver the past several years, New Jersey moved toward the development and implementation of \nan automated child welfare information system that meets federal SACWIS requirements and \nprovides a case management tool for workers with greatly increased functionality for \nmanagement and reporting including resource and financial management.  DCF was expected to \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 75 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \ncomplete Release 2 Phase 1 of NJ SPIRIT by July 2006 (Section II.J.4) and continue its work \ntoward the full development and implementation of the system.   \n \nRelease 2 Phase 1 was completed in June 2006 and includes four elements:  \n•  Litigation forms are now on-line and available to DYFS workers and Deputy \nAttorney Generals (DAGs); \n•  Resource Family Recruitment events can be tracked on-line; \n•  On-line policy is available through the NJ SPIRIT desktop; and  \n•  All staff have view-only access to NJ SPIRIT, allowing them to learn how to log on \nand get comfortable with navigating an on-line system.  \n \nSince the release of Phase 1, work continued toward the Phase 2 release this summer, which \nincludes the case management, and resource and financial management components.  \nManagement for the NJ SPIRIT work shifted to a senior member of the DCF leadership team in \nNovember 2006, and DCF senior management as a whole closely tracks NJ SPIRIT progress \nagainst a detailed work plan and timetable.   By the end of December 2006, much of the work \nfocused on customization of the software to reflect DYFS case management and business \npractices and extensive testing of functions by potential users.  Simultaneous to the development \nwork on NJ SPIRIT, is work to ensure the accuracy of the existing data that will be converted to \nNJ SPIRIT once it is operational.   \n \nGiven the enormity of the effort and the experience of multiple States who have now \nimplemented SACWIS systems, New Jersey made several important decisions.  First, is ensuring \nthat end users (meaning front-line staff and policy and program staff) are closely involved in all \nof the application development and testing.  Second is the decision to roll out the system initially \nin one area of the State as an operational pilot.  This deployment will begin in April 2007.  (It \nwas originally scheduled for March 2007 but was moved back one month to avoid any possible \ndisruptions in end of the quarter fiscal and programmatic reporting).  During the pilot period \nfrom April to June, 2007, it is inevitable, based on other States’ experiences, that additional \nproblems will be identified.  The Department anticipates that the pilot experience will result in \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine    Page 76 \nPeriod 1 Monitoring Report, February 26, 2007 \n \n\n \nmodifications that can be more easily made before full deployment to the remainder of the State \nin July 2006. \n \nWhile the work goes on to develop and test the system, the Department is also taking steps to get \nworkers ready to accept the new technology.  This is being done in part through worker training \nand access now to “Safe Measures” which is teaching them how to manage their caseload \nactivities through a computerized system.  It is also being supported through the NJ SPIRIT \nknowledge web, which is already operational, keeps staff informed about progress, and is \nworking to improve staff readiness to use NJ SPIRIT. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. v.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed in July 2006 by the Honorable \nStanley R. Chesler of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey as Federal \nMonitor of the class action lawsuit Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie. As Monitor, CSSP is \ncharged with independently assessing New Jersey’s compliance with the goals, principles and \noutcomes of the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) aimed at improving the state’s child \nwelfare system.1 \nAs is well known, in October 2012 New Jersey was severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy and \nthe effects of the storm have reverberated throughout the state in many ways. The storm effected \nworkers and their families, as well as resource families, children, youth and families involved \nwith Department of Children and Family Services (DCF). For periods of time, normal life in \nmany parts of New Jersey came to a standstill. After the worst of the storm hit, many families \nfound their homes destroyed or damaged, some lost electrical power for extended periods of time \nand others lost heat and other basic necessities. DCF staff, many of whom were also \nexperiencing these same hardships with their own families, went above and beyond to tend to the \nneeds of their clients and their clients’ families. During as well as in the aftermath of the storm, \nworkers continued to operate the child abuse State Central Registry (SCR) to accept and respond \nto reports of child abuse and neglect without any disruption. DCF staff also reached out to every \nresource family and placement provider to ensure that children were safe. DCF staff across the \nstate should be applauded for this exemplary work. \nIn recognition of the extraordinary nature of this natural disaster, and the difficulties Superstorm \nSandy created for the state and its ability to provide services in the immediate aftermath of the \nstorm, the parties to this lawsuit agreed and the Court sanctioned extending the reporting \nperiod—which otherwise would have covered July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012—by three \nmonths to March 31, 2013. As a result, this report includes nine months of performance data for \nthe period between July 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013.  Hereafter, reporting will resume a schedule \nof six months increments with the next reporting period covering April 1, 2013 to September 30, \n2013. It should be noted that despite the hardships Superstorm Sandy inflicted on the state, \nperformance on MSA requirements was affected in only a small number of areas, such as in the \nnumber of children receiving Comprehensive Medical Examinations, and the timeliness of \nresolving resource family applications. The ability of New Jersey’s child welfare system to \nrespond and continue to operate smoothly despite the external disruptions is indicative of a \nsystem with a solid, yet responsive infrastructure and a committed workforce.  \nThis is the 13th monitoring report under the MSA and the seventh report that includes Phase II \nrequirements of the MSA.2 \n \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n1 To see the full Agreement, go to http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/home/Modified_Settlement_Agreement_7_17_06.pdf. \n2 Copies of all previous Monitoring Reports can be found at www.cssp.org. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF provides extensive aggregate \nand back-up data as well as access to staff at all levels to enable the Monitor to verify \nperformance.  For this report, the Monitor was involved in the following additional activities: \n \n  Caseload Data Verification \n \nThe Monitor conducted a telephone survey of 111 caseworkers to verify their individual \ncaseloads during this monitoring period.   \n \n  Housing, Employment and Education Status Review for Older Youth Exiting Care \n \nThe Monitor collaborated with DCF to review case records of 65 youth ages 18-21 years \nwho exited care between July 1 and December 31, 2012 without achieving permanency. \nThe review primarily focused on the education, housing and employment status of these \nyouth and the transition planning activities undertaken by DCF. Findings and \nrecommendations from the review are discussed in Section XII—Services to Older Youth \n—of this report.   \n \n  Investigations Practice Review \n \nIn January 2013, the Monitor collaborated with DCF to review a statistically valid sample \nof 324 Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations involving 688 children assigned to \nDCF Local Offices between September 16 and 29, 2012 to assess the overall quality of \nDCF’s investigative practice. Among other things, the review assessed response times of \ninvestigations, timeliness to completion of investigations and the quality of investigation \ndecision making. Findings and key recommendations from the review are detailed in \nSection IV of this report.    \n \n  Family Team Meeting (FTM) Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed case records of 40 families to verify data on FTMs held in March \n2013. Reviewers examined documentation from case files in which DCF data indicated \nthat the parent was either unavailable or declined to participate in a FTM.  \n \n  Visitation Data Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed case records from January 2013 for 31 families to examine \nvisitation exceptions as applied by DCF for parents who were not available or where \nvisits were not required for parent and child weekly visits. Additionally, the Monitor \nreviewed case records for 42 children from March 2013 which were categorized as \nhaving the requisite two visits by the caseworker to the child during the first two months \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 11 of 186 PageID: 7108\n \n \nof initial or subsequent placement.  Findings from these validation reviews are discussed \nin Section V—Implementing the Case Practice Model—of this report.   \n \n  Other Monitoring Activities \nThe Monitor interviewed and/or visited multiple external stakeholders of New Jersey’s \nchild welfare system, including contracted service providers, youth, relatives, birth \nparents, advocacy organizations and judicial officers. The Monitor also periodically \nattends DCF’s ChildStat meetings, statewide Child Fatality meetings, adolescent practice \nforums, Area Director meetings, Health Care Case Reviews, youth advisory board \nmeetings and participates in statewide Qualitative Reviews.  \n \nStructure of the Report \n \nSection II of the report provides an overview of the state’s accomplishments and challenges. \nSection III provides summary performance data on each of the outcomes and performance \nmeasures required by the MSA in Table 1, Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie Child and Family \nOutcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Summary of Performance as of March 31, \n2013).  \n \nThe remaining sections of the report provide more detailed data and discussion of performance in \nthe following areas:  \n  New Jersey child protective services units which receive reports and investigate \nallegations of alleged child maltreatment (Section IV); \n  Implementation of DCF’s Case Practice Model (Section V); \n  Information regarding New Jersey’s placement of children in out-of-home settings, \nincidence of maltreatment of children in foster care, and abuse and neglect of children \nwhen they reunite with families (Sections VI and VII); \n  New Jersey’s efforts to achieve permanency for children either through reunification with \nfamily, legal guardianship or adoption (Section VIII); \n  Improvements in the state’s provision of health care and mental health services to \nchildren and families (Sections IX and X); \n  Services provided to children, youth and families involved with DCF and to prevent child \nwelfare system involvement (Section XI); \n  Services to older youth (Section XII);  \n  Staff caseloads and workforce training (Section XIII); and \n  Accountability through the Qualitative Review and the production and use of accurate \ndata (Section XIV). \n \nIn order to better understand the progress DCF has made since the start of the reform, the report \nincludes, where appropriate, trend data from the first available data, usually June 2009, through \nMarch 2013.3 In addition, for the first time in this report, Appendices B-1 through B-5 provide \ndata by Local Office on selected key case practice measures.    \n                                                 \n3 For some Performance Measures, March 2013 data are not available. For those areas, the most recent data are cited \nwith applicable timeframes. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CHALLENGES \nNew Jersey’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) remains focused on efforts to sustain \nthe gains already made under the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) and to accelerate \ncompliance with the remaining MSA Performance Measures. The significant progress \ndocumented in this report in multiple areas reflects the hard work of staff from caseworkers to \nadministrators across the state and the accomplishments of their many partners including private \nagencies, health and mental health professionals, attorneys, resource parents, the courts and \nothers.  \nAs of March 31, 2013, 21 of the MSA’s 53 Performance Measures4 have been met and eight \nwere partially met.5 For three of the eight partially met Performance Measures, DCF reached \nMSA target levels at the conclusion of the monitoring period in one or two months, indicating an \nupward trend in performance. There are other measures that were not met but where performance \nimproved during the monitoring period. DCF should be proud of these accomplishments.  The \nreport also identifies challenges, most notably around the quality of case planning and case \npractice and increases in rates of repeat maltreatment that need to remain the priority focus for \nDCF improvement efforts going forward. \nTwo Performance Measures were newly met during this monitoring period:  \n  Adequacy of DAsG staffing (Performance Measure 22) \n  Completing Independent Living Assessment for Youth Ages 14-18 (Performance \nMeasure 53) \n \nThree Performance Measures were achieved for one or two months at the conclusion of the \nmonitoring period and therefore partially6 met MSA final targets: \n \n  Timeliness of initial case plans (Performance Measure 10) \n  Timeliness of current case plans  (Performance Measure 11) \n  Caseworker visits with parent/family members for children with a goal of \nreunification (Performance Measure 18) \n \n \n                                                 \n4 The previous monitoring report references 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures for the current monitoring period.  \n5 “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close but has not substantially met the requirement, for example \nmeeting the requirement in the final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has \ntwo or more sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all. See \nfootnote 10 for a more detailed explanation of terms used in this report regarding compliance levels. Performance is \nbased upon the most recent available data through March 31, 2013. \n6 This list includes Performance Measures newly achieved for one or two months at the conclusion of the monitoring \nperiod. There are four additional Performance Measures that the Monitor deemed as partially met that are described \nin the report but are not included as part of this list. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The data on specific Performance Measures are provided in Table 1 and the remainder of \nthe report.  \n \nInvestigative Practice  \n \nThere are many strengths to DCF’s investigative practice.  The State Central Registry (SCR) \noperates professionally, efficiently and effectively; reports of alleged abuse and neglect are \nappropriately screened and timely forwarded to the field for investigation.  Investigative staff are \nwell trained.  It is important to note that investigation caseloads rose in the previous monitoring \nperiod and although improved in the past nine months, are still higher than acceptable.  The \nremaining areas of challenge, perhaps affected by the caseloads, are ensuring timely completion \nof investigations and improving the quality of investigative practices and decision making to \nensure consistent quality in practice.   \n \nImplementation of the Case Practice Model  \n \nDCF’s approach to implementing a new Case Practice Model that requires better engagement \nwith children, youth and families and more individualized service planning has been a multi-year \nundertaking involving multiple policy and practice change strategies as well as intensive training \nfor new and existing staff and many partners. During this monitoring period, DCF initiated a \nnumber of new strategies to improve case practice performance that appear to have helped the \nstate significantly improve performance and in some instances meet MSA standards by the end \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 14 of 186 PageID: 7111\n \n \nof the monitoring period for the process requirements such as the timely completion of case \nplans; completion of safety and risk assessments; and standards for visitation between children \nand workers, workers and parents and children in placement and their parents and siblings. \nNotably, the state’s performance for all MSA visitation measures has shown demonstrated \nimprovement during this period. To achieve these gains, strategies have included weekly \nconferences between DCF leadership, Area Directors and their Local Office managers to review \nindividual performance on specific measures, including visitation, Family Team Meetings and \ncase plan development. Additionally, the DCP&P Director held meetings with Area Directors \nwho were required to submit performance improvement plans for specific measures where \nperformance was low.   \n \nDespite this wide range of thoughtful approaches, DCF continues to confront significant \nchallenges in its efforts to improve the quality of case practice.  Of concern are the Quality \nReview (QR) scores which received very low ratings for performance on family engagement, \neffective use of Family Team Meetings and on the quality of case planning with children, youth \nand families. \n \nWhile DCF leaders and supervisors have continued to emphasize that case practice \nimprovements must occur in the measurable processes (i.e., timely visits and timely case plans), \nthe QR results across the state show the difficulty in simultaneously reinforcing both quantity \nand quality expectations in accountability for worker and supervisor performance.  While \nimprovement in the completion and documentation of case plans is a significant \naccomplishment, DCF staff must now place equal emphasis on the consistent quality of the case \nplans and the case planning process. Similarly, while making sure that visits happen is step one, \nthe task now is to make every visit an opportunity for effectively implementing appropriate case \nplans.  \n \nNotwithstanding the disappointing QR results, the state’s emphasis on looking closely at the \nquality of practice, sharing the results openly and involving staff at all levels in problem solving \non effective practice improvement strategies is laudable. DCF’s use of ChildStat meetings is an \nexample of one of the important practice improvement strategies that the state has developed and \nis using to identify both the strengths and areas needing improvement as well as the service \ndelivery and policy barriers that may influence child and family outcomes. It is anticipated that \nas the intensive efforts to track both quantity and quality of performance continues at all levels \nand in each Local Office, it will provide greater insight into and adoption of successful strategies \nfor implementing the Case Practice Model that can be replicated across the state and serve to \ncontinually improve practice. \n \nPlacement of Children in Out-of-Home Care \n \nPerformance on MSA requirements regarding the appropriate placement of children in the state’s \ncustody remains very strong.  Ninety-nine percent of cases examined through the QR were \njudged to be acceptable on the appropriateness of a child’s placement.  DCF has continued to \nmeet standards related to the placement of children in a family setting and within placement \ncapacity limits. Further, as repeatedly documented, there are now almost no children placed out \nof state for treatment and DCF meets all of the MSA requirements regarding restrictions on the \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 15 of 186 PageID: 7112\n \n \nuse of inappropriate placements such as congregate care for young children and detention \nplacements. There has been strong performance on placement of sibling groups together with the \nexception of the need for additional resources for sibling groups of four or more children.  DCF \nhas demonstrated consistent performance in not placing youth under age 13 in shelters and is \nusing shelters appropriately for emergency placement for older youth.  The state’s continuing \nefforts to appropriately recruit, license, train and retain resource parents are impressive. DCF’s \ncompliance with the MSA standard regarding the acceptable level of substantiated abuse or \nneglect to a child in foster care is an important positive outcome related to the appropriateness of \nplacement and placement supports.  Also encouraging, the rate of stability for children in out-of-\nhome care is just short of meeting the MSA standard that at least 88 percent of children entering \ncare will have two or fewer placements during the 12 months from the date they enter care; in \nCY 2011, the most recent year for which data are available, 85 percent of children entering care \nmet the MSA standard, a significant achievement. \n \nRepeat Maltreatment and Re-Entry into Foster Care \n \nThe MSA has several Performance Measures related to the repeat maltreatment of children who \nhave been served by DCP&P through in-home services or in out-of-home placement.  DCF’s \nperformance on each of the repeat maltreatment outcome measures is below the acceptable \nPerformance Standard and has declined in this latest monitoring period, raising important \nconcerns that may be related to the quality of investigations and some of the case practice issues \nnoted above.  Also concerning is the rate of children and youth who re-enter placement within a \nyear of leaving custody.  The need for efforts to improve performance on timely and careful risk \nreassessments at case closure may positively impact this outcome going forward.  In this \nmonitoring period, while performance of risk re-assessments completed within 30 days of case \nclosure improved to 59 percent, it remains below the MSA target and additional improvement is \nneeded.  \n \nTimely Permanency through Reunification, Adoption or Legal Guardianship \n \nThe state’s performance on measures related to timely permanency through reunification, \nadoption or legal guardianship is based on the calendar year and the most recent data are \npresented in the report.  These outcome data are disappointing and may reflect some of the case \npractice concerns noted above. Overall, DCF’s performance in timely meeting permanency goals \nand discharging children to permanency has remained the same or declined and does not meet \nthe levels required by the MSA final targets. The one exception is that performance on finalizing \nadoptions within nine months of an adoptive placement remains strong.  \n \nHealth and Mental Health Care for Children in Out-of-Home Placement \n \nSince June 2011, DCF has maintained or improved performance on nearly all MSA Performance \nMeasures related to health care services. As has been emphasized in the past several monitoring \nreports, DCF’s work through its Child Health Units and with its nurses and health and mental \nhealth providers has meant that performance on the MSA’s health and mental health indicators \nhas been consistently strong.  Further, results from the QRs on the provision of health care \nservices were rated acceptable for 99 percent of the cases reviewed. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This investment has \nresulted in a network of FSCs across the state that proved critically important for many New \nJersey families affected by Superstorm Sandy.  FSCs served as an important community-based \nsupport and referral resource for the FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers.  Some FSCs held food \nand clothing drives and special recovery information events.  Commissioner Allison Blake \nidentified funding to establish a FSC in Union Beach to work with and serve families affected by \nthe storm. This investment and the work that continues to enhance the skills and resources of the \nFSCs is a significant system strength.  Additionally, under the MSA, DCF continues to provide a \nrange of post-adoption supports to families and has been working to increase its capacity to \neffectively identify families affected by domestic violence and link them to appropriate services.  \nAn area for continued improvement remains the provision of services to support successful \ntransitions and life adjustments which was rated at least minimally acceptable for slightly more \nthan half of the cases reviewed in recent QRs.  \n \nServices to Older Youth  \n \nDCF has made improvements to the provision of services and supports to adolescents, including \nthose older youth transitioning from care.  As is discussed later in the report, DCF has begun a \nnumber of significant strategies to better engage and serve older youth including a \ncomprehensive review of its policies and programs. This much more intensive focus on youth \nhas led to a notable improvement in performance.  In particular, 98 percent of youth ages 14 to \n18 completed Independent Living Assessments. This was the first time this measure has been \nmet.  Significant challenges remain however in ensuring that older youth in foster care are \nappropriately assessed, engaged and linked to needed resources and supports and that those \nyouth exiting care without permanency have housing, are employed or in training or in an \neducational program.  The Monitor and DCF recently completed 20 QRs of older youth with an \nopen DCF case, the results of which are expected to be presented in October 2013. A case record \nreview of older youth who exited care in the last six months of 2012 found significant areas for \nimprovement with respect to stable housing, education and training, and employment outcomes \nfor these youth.   \n \nAs is clear from the discussion above, despite the challenges that must be addressed in order for \nthe state to meet the requirements and fully achieve the objectives of the MSA, there are multiple \nareas of strength and the data support the significant progress that has been made on many fronts \nduring this monitoring period. DCF’s use of data to identify where it is succeeding and where it \nis still struggling, both in terms of substantive areas and by local offices within the state is a \nsensible strategy to target improvement efforts. As mentioned, QRs continue to provide county-\nlevel data on the state’s progress in implementing the Case Practice Model, and DCF staff at all \nlevels are moving forward with multiple strategies to diagnose and assess barriers to quality case \npractice. DCF’s ChildStat meetings are effectively used to share quantitative and qualitative data \nfrom multiple contexts and with both internal staff and external partners to better understand and \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

In the Monitor’s view, DCF continues to \ndemonstrate its commitment to a robust, vital quality assurance and accountability process. To \nmaximally meet DCF’s quality improvement goals, the focus of these accountability efforts must \nincreasingly be on the quality and outcomes as well as on the quantity of the work effort. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CHILD AND FAMILY OUTCOME AND CASE PRACTICE PERFORMANCE \nMEASURES \n \nThe Child and Family Outcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Performance \nMeasures), are 53 measures that assess the state’s performance on meeting the requirements of \nthe MSA (see Table 1).7  These Performance Measures cover the areas of child safety, \npermanency, service planning, child well-being and ongoing infrastructure requirements \npertaining to elements such as caseloads, training and resource family recruitment and retention.  \n \nMany of the measures are assessed using data from NJ SPIRIT, the DCP&P data management \nsystem, and SafeMeasures;8 reviewed and in many areas independently validated by the Monitor. \nSome data are also provided through the Department’s work with Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc. \nthat assists with data analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 The previous monitoring report references 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures for the current monitoring period.  \n8 SafeMeasures is a data warehouse and analytical tool that allows tracking of critical child welfare indicators by \nworker, supervisor, Local Office area and statewide. It is used by different levels of staff to track, monitor and \nanalyze trends in case practice and targeted measures and outcomes.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

In other instances, the Monitor \nprovides a range of data over the monitoring period to better illustrate performance.  More detailed information on DCF performance on specific measures is provided in \nsubsequent sections of the report. \n10 “Yes” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on presently available information, DCF has substantially fulfilled its obligations regarding the requirement under the \nMSA for the majority of the months during July 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 monitoring period. The Monitor has also designated “Yes” for a requirement where DCF is within one \npercentage point of the final target or there are a small number (less than 3) of cases causing the failure to meet the final target. “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close \nbut has not substantially met the requirement, for example meeting the requirement in final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has two or \nmore sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all.  “No” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, DCF has not fulfilled its \nobligation regarding the requirement.  \n11 Where applicable, “” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on data and an understanding of case practice, performance is trending upwards by at least three \npercentage points; “” indicates performance is trending downward by at least three percentage points; “↔” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, there has been no change in \nperformance; “N/A” indicates a judgment regarding direction of change is not applicable to the measure during the monitoring period. \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families                October 2013  \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Because the Monitor could not verify DCF’s data on this measure, reporting reflects FTMs that actually occurred and does not exclude the number of FTMs in which the parent was reported as unavailable or declined \nto attend the FTM, a change from previous reporting periods.  Therefore the June 2012 performance data shown here differ than what was reported for December 2012 in the previous monitoring period. Using this \nmethodology, in June 2012, out of a possible 311 FTMs, 109 (35%) occurred within 30 days of placement. During the next monitoring period, the Monitor and DCF plan to conduct a statistically valid case record review to \nmore fully understand the practice and documentation issues on legitimate instances where parents were unavailable or declined to participate in FTMs.   \n17 See footnote 16 for an explanation of change in reporting methodology.  In June 2012, out of a possible 1,581 FTMs, 526 (33%) occurred in the required timeframe.  \n18 See footnote 16 above for explanation of change in reporting methodology. Using this methodology, in March 2013, out of 358 possible FTMs, 200 (56%) occurred.  An additional number of FTMs were not held because \nthe worker determined the parent to be unavailable or because the parent declined to attend, but the Monitor does not have sufficient confidence in the reasons provided by DCF for why the 158 FTMs did not occur. \nPerformance data for the monitoring period are as follows: July 2012, 57%; August 2012, 51%; September 2012, 47%; October 2012, 34%; November 2012, 46%; December 2012, 43%; January 2013, 52%; February 2013, \n56%; March 2013, 56%.  \n19 See footnote 16 for an explanation for the change in methodology. Using this methodology, in March 2013, out of 1,758 possible FTMs, 815 (46%) occurred.  An additional number of FTMs were not held because the \nworker determined the parent to be unavailable or because the parent declined to attend. The Monitor could not find sufficient documentation to verify the reasons why the remaining 943 FTMs did not occur.

New Jersey’s State Central Registry (SCR) \n \nNew Jersey’s State Central Registry (SCR) is charged with receiving calls of suspected child \nabuse and neglect as well as calls where reporters believe the well-being of families is at risk and \nan assessment, support, and/or information and referral is needed, even though there is no \nallegation of child abuse or neglect. The SCR operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week \nwith multiple shifts of staff and supervisors and a sophisticated call management and recording \nsystem. Screeners at SCR determine the nature of each caller’s concerns and initiate the \nappropriate response.  \n \nThis function also includes receiving calls about and investigating allegations of abuse and/or \nneglect in institutional settings (e.g., resource homes, schools, shelters, detention facilities).  \nDCP&P Local Offices employ investigative staff to follow up on the calls as appropriate and a \nregionally organized Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) is responsible for \ninvestigations in institutional settings. \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Data from the \ncall system show that in March 2013 callers waited approximately 21 seconds for an SCR \nscreener to answer their calls. Of all the calls received during this monitoring period, 42,730 \n(34%) calls57 related to the possible need for Child Protective Services (CPS) responses. Of \nthose, screeners classified 42,056 reports for investigation of alleged child abuse or neglect. \nAnother 10,967 (9%) calls related to the possible need for Child Welfare Services (CWS) and \nassessment of service need of which 10,585 (8%) were referred for response. Figure 1 shows a \nmonth-by-month breakdown of the call volume at SCR for July 2012 through March 2013.  \n \nFigure 1:  Number of Calls to SCR by Month \n(July 2012 – March 2013) \n \n20,000\n19,000\n18,000\n17,000\n16,000\ns\nCall 15,000 15,401 14,993\nof  14,797\nr  14,000 14,535\nmbe 13,000 13,951 13,148 13,250 13,170 13,597\nu\nN\n12,000\n11,000\n10,000\nJul-12 Aug-12 Sep-12 Oct-12 Nov-12 Dec-12 Jan-13 Feb-13 Mar-13\nJul-12       Aug-12        Sep-12        Oct-12      Nov-12       Dec-12      Jan-13     Feb-13     Mar-13 \n \nM o Mntohnth\nSource:  DCF data \n \n \n                                                 \n57 Calls are differentiated from reports or referrals because SCR can receive several calls related to one incident or in \nsome cases one call can result in several separate reports.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Essential information gathered—identification of parents and other important family members \nc.  Decision making process based on information gathered and guided by tools and supervision \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \nPerformance as of March 31, 2013: \n \nBetween July 2012 and March 2013, the SCR continued to implement a number of system \nimprovements related to staffing, training and quality assurance. In July 2012, SCR completed a \nredesign of supervisor and screener training with DCF’s Child Welfare Training Academy. DCF \nemployees who transfer to SCR58 currently receive up to 20 days of training with an increased \nemphasis on live-call training. Newly hired SCR staff spend the final week of their training \nperiod on the designated shift they are assigned. This process permits the supervisor to become \nan active participant in the screener's training process. Additionally, in June and July 2012, SCR \nsupervisors participated in leadership training, as well as professional leadership projects and \nprograms, specifically the Leadership Academy for Middle Managers (LAMM) and DCP&P \nManagement Fellows project, among others.  This leadership training is part of an ongoing effort \nto increase supervisors’ capacity to address complex situations, apply processes and resources to \nachieve accountability, measure results and assist in the implementation of sustained system \nchange to better support screeners and improve outcomes for children and families.  \n \nQuality assurance remains a priority for the SCR. A Quality Assurance Peer Review Team \ncompletes a daily review of all reports designated as information and referral (I&R)59 generated \nthe previous business day. SCR staff evaluate 75 percent of every I&R Intake call received the \nprevious business day to ensure they are properly categorized. Supervisory staff more closely \nexamine the remaining 25 percent of I&R calls for proper case practice. To account for internal \nbias, reports identified with concerns are reviewed by casework supervisors who were not \nincluded in the referral’s decision making process. The SCR administrator performs a daily \nreview of randomly selected reports. SCR supervisors also review and evaluate a prescribed \nnumber of calls for their staff in order to continually assess their screeners' performance, identify \nareas in need of improvement and provide on-going training to strengthen staff skills.  \n \nThe call management system is currently being updated to allow screeners to have access to their \nown calls at their desktop via email so they can listen again to the call as they write their report \nand to facilitate supervision. This upgrade, scheduled to be completed in January 2014, will \nallow for immediate evaluation of screeners’ work by supervisors and will enable prompt \nsupervisory feedback to screeners on their performance.    \n \n                                                 \n58 All employees at SCR must have prior field experience. \n59 A call is identified as an I & R call when (1) a caller is seeking a referral to one or more service providers, (2) a \nSCR screener determines that a referral is the appropriate response to the concern raised by the caller, or (3) the \nmatter is referred back to the caller for handling (e.g., police calling about non-abuse incident, school calling about \neducational neglect). \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The \nfindings of this review reflect some clear strengths in DCP&P investigative case practice as well \nas areas in need of further development.  Key strengths include:64 \n \n  safety and risk assessments were completed in 100 percent of the investigations, \n  caseworkers interviewed the mother of the alleged child victim in 97 percent of \ninvestigations, \n  caseworkers met the required response time to contact the alleged child victim in 93 \npercent of investigations and  \n  pre-investigation worker/supervisor conferences took place in 86 percent of the \ninvestigations.   \n \nOverall, recommendations for improvement include clarification through policy, training and \nmentoring of staff and supervisors on some key areas of investigative practice and improvement \nin documentation of investigative activities and events. These areas of investigative practice \ninclude:  \n  \n  Reviewing and understanding a family’s prior child protection history through interviews \nwith other DCP&P workers as well as other child protective authorities. This was of \nparticular significance as over 70 percent of the investigations in the review had prior \nDCP&P history.   \n  Integrating collateral information into investigative decision making. Reviewers \ndetermined that all applicable collateral information was obtained in only 49 percent of \ninvestigations.  \n  Interviewing fathers of alleged child victims during investigations. Reviewers found that \n69 percent of fathers were interviewed.  \n \n \nC.

Corrective Action Monitoring from IAIU Investigations \n \nIf the evidence from an investigation does not support substantiating maltreatment, the \ninvestigation is considered “unfounded.”  However, during the course of an IAIU investigation, \ninvestigators may identify policy, licensing, training or other issues that require attention.  These \ncircumstances often prompt the investigators to conclude that even though the allegation of \nabuse or neglect was unfounded, there remain concerns that should be addressed.  IAIU \ninvestigators refer to this as a finding “with concerns.”  The concerns generally require some \ntype of corrective action by the facility or resource home.   \n \nEvery IAIU investigation results in a finding letter sent to a facility or resource home.  This letter \ncites the investigative conclusion and, when applicable, concerns that are distinct from the \ninvestigative finding.  The Office of Licensing (OOL) is informed of every finding letter. IAIU’s \nContinuous Quality Improvement (CQI) staff is responsible for monitoring the development and \ncompletion of corrective actions required by concerns raised in IAIU investigations (MSA \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 51 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 60 of 186 PageID: 7157\n \n \nSection II.I.2).  Between July 2012 and March 2013, IAIU issued 326 corrective action requests \ninvolving resource family homes, group homes and residential facilities where foster children \nwere placed.  DCP&P policy allows 30 days to complete or accept a corrective action. \nInformation reported from the IAIU corrective action database indicate that 204 (63%) of 326 \ncorrective actions had been successfully completed (accepted) and 88 (37%) of corrective action \nrequests were outstanding or pending resolution as of March 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2013, the \n88 corrective action requests due had been outstanding for 31 to 260 calendar days since the date \nof the findings letter.   \n \nCorrective Action Reports \n \nThe Monitor reviewed ten cases randomly selected from incidents that occurred between July \n2012 and March 2013 in the corrective action database to look at feedback mechanisms between \nIAIU and other divisions (e.g. CSOC, OOL) and to ensure corrective action plans (CAPs) are \nbeing developed.  The sample included five resource family homes, two group homes, two \nresidential facilities and one relative placement. IAIU’s CQI accepted eight of the ten CAPs.  \nOne CAP was not submitted and the other was pending while staff continued working on it \nbeyond the monitoring period. CAPs in this sample resulted in verified re-training and \ntermination of staff at a group home and a residential facility; re-training of resource and relative \nparents on DCP&P policies and procedures; rejecting the licensing application of a resource \nhome, and closing a resource home.  The CAPs reviewed appeared to adequately address the \nincidents which prompted the IAIU investigation.  There was evidence of appropriate \ncommunication between divisions in all reports, particularly between IAIU and OOL regarding \nthe licensure of resource homes under investigation.   All communication on record occurred via \nemail or inter-office memos.  In addition, IAIU’s Corrective Action Unit hosts a Systems Partner \nmeeting with OOL, Child Care Licensing (CCL), Residential Licensing (RL), Resource Family \nLicensing (RFL) and SCR once a month to ensure that issues identified during IAIU \ninvestigations are communicated to all the partners.  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

IMPLEMENTING THE CASE PRACTICE MODEL  \n \nDCF continues to train and support additional staff who are expected to practice according to the \nCase Practice Model (CPM). The CPM is designed to guide and support staff towards a strength-\nbased and family-centered approach that ensures the safety, permanency and well-being of \nchildren. This practice requires engagement with children, youth and families through teamwork \nand crafting individualized case plans with families and children. The Performance Measures \ndiscussed below measure progress on some of these activities using data from NJ SPIRIT and \ndata collected during the state’s Qualitative Review (QR) process.   \n \nA.  Activities Supporting the Implementation of the Case Practice Model \n \nDCP&P continues to build its capacity to coach, facilitate and supervise Family Team Meetings \n(FTMs), a critical element of the CPM. Each DCF Area Office now has an Implementation \nSpecialist who is responsible for providing ongoing assistance to staff to practice according to \nthe CPM.  Implementation Specialists continue to lead case practice improvement efforts \nstatewide by training and mentoring staff to serve as facilitators, coaches and master coaches \nwho conduct FTMs and implement the CPM.68  The Implementation Specialists conduct on-site \ntraining tailored to the needs of each Local Office, including topics such as how to effectively \nengage families, building effective teams and how to identify strengths and needs in complex \nchild protection cases.  Implementation Specialists are also trained to be Quality Reviewers and \nto support the linkage of practice to outcomes. During the nine month reporting period the \nImplementation Specialists have also: \n \n  conducted training on the appropriate use of family agreements and case plans; \n  led areas in developing how best to use the Child and Family Team/Family Team \nMeeting pilot between DCP&P and Children's System of Care (CSOC); \n  conducted training focused on enhanced partnership between permanency and adoption \nstaff; \n  created a new work group, the Adolescent Round Table, to support more effective \nengagement with youth age 18 to 21; and \n  made presentations for the Children in Court committee (CIC) and the Child Placement \nAdvisory Council. \n \nAs of March 31, 2013, DCF developed 2,007 staff as FTM facilitators, 288 as coaches and 110 \nas master coaches. Table 3 shows the number of facilitators, coaches and master coaches by \nDCP&P area.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n68 Coaches are DCP&P staff of varying levels who are trained specifically to lead FTMs; master coaches train Local \nOffice and area staff to become facilitators and coaches. Facilitators are trained to conduct Family Team Meetings \naccording to protocol and the principles and values of DCF’s CPM.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As additional offices participate in ChildStat, more \nstaff from many levels within DCF have become better able to use data to demonstrate Local \nOffice performance. The Monitor continues to regularly attend DCF’s ChildStat meetings and \nremains encouraged by the quality of the analyses presented.  DCF is now using the ChildStat \nprocess to more deeply examine cases of frequently encountered families, those families who \n                                                 \n69 ChildStat is a process wherein organizations use quantitative and qualitative data from multiple contexts to \nunderstand and attempt to improve service delivery.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This \nexamination has led to suggested changes to policy that will be used statewide to improve \npractice.  As of September 2012, DCF has invited outside stakeholders and partners to attend its \nChildStat meetings.  DCF’s efforts at self-examination and diagnosis continues to be a \nproductive way to reinforce to staff and DCF partners the elements of quality case practice and \nthe standards of practice that DCF expects for all cases.  \n \nConcurrent Planning Practice \n \nDCF continues holding case planning meetings at five and ten months into a child’s placement to \naddress concurrent planning, a practice used throughout the country in which caseworkers work \nwith families with children in out-of-home placement to reunify children as quickly as possible \nwhile simultaneously pursuing alternative permanency options should reunification efforts fail. \nDCP&P conducts “enhanced reviews” after a child has been in placement for five and ten \nmonths to carry out its concurrent planning required by the MSA.70 Enhanced reviews occur in \nall 47 DCP&P Local Offices. \n \nStatewide, in March 2013, 95 percent of applicable families had required five month reviews, \nand 97 percent had required ten month reviews. \n \nAs Table 4 reflects, in March 2013, 95 percent of five month reviews due that month were \ncompleted timely statewide.  Between July 2012 and March 2013, monthly performance on this \nmeasure ranged from 95 to 98 percent. \n  \n \nTable 4:  Five Month Enhanced Review \n(July 2012 – March 2013) \n \nJul-12  Aug-12  Sep-12  Oct-12  Nov-‘12  Dec-12  Jan-13  Feb-13  Mar-13 \n \n#  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  % \nReviews \nCompleted w/in  281   95%    305   96%  276    96%  322    97%   265    95%  270     98%   334   95%  298  98%  312    95% \nfive months \nReviews Not \nCompleted w/in  16    5%  14    4%  12     4%    11     3%    13     5%     6     2%    16   5%     6   2%   17     5% \nfive months \nTotals  297  100%  319  100%  288  100%  333  100%  278  100%  276  100%  350  100%  304  100%  329  100% \nSource:  DCF data \n \n \nTable 5 shows that statewide in March 2013, 97 percent of ten month reviews due that month \nwere completed timely.

Performance Measures on Family Team Meetings and Case Planning \n \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) are intended to work in concert with individualized case \nplanning to support improved results for children and families. Caseworkers are trained and \ncoached to hold FTMs at key decision points in the life of a case, such as when a child enters \nplacement, when a child has a change of placement and/or when there is a need to adjust a case \nplan.  Working at optimal capacity, FTMs enable families, providers, formal and informal \nsupports to exchange information that can be critical to coordinating and following up on \nservices, examining and solving problems, and achieving positive outcomes.  Meetings are to be \nscheduled according to the family’s availability in an effort to get as many family members and \nfamily supports as possible around the table. Engaging the family, the core of New Jersey’s \nCPM, is a critical component of successful family teaming.  \n \nChanging practice to include regular FTMs for every family when appropriate has been \nconsistently challenging for the state, despite intensive efforts involving training, coaching and \nsupervision.  The state acknowledges that more work needs to be done to fully engage families \nand encourage participation in FTMs.  Some of the difficulty in meeting this Performance \nMeasure appears to be due to families not wanting to participate in FTMs, and DCF has \nstruggled with how to accurately assess and document this information, while simultaneously \nimproving engagement skills of workers. As discussed more fully below, the Monitor reviewed \nrecords from 40 families in which DCF reported that FTMs did not occur due to the parent being \nunavailable or unwilling to participate. The Monitor could not find documentation to support \nDCP&P’s data in a significant number of cases, so the Monitor assessed performance this \nmonitoring period by counting FTMs that actually occurred and did not exclude from the \nuniverse the reported number of FTMs in which the parent was unavailable or the parent \ndeclined to attend. This is a change in how performance has been previously assessed. \n \n \nFamily Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings \n \n \n7.  Family Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings:   A family team (involving \nparents, youth and appropriate formal and informal supports) shall meet and plan together. The \nteam should be involved in planning & decision making throughout a case and have the skills, \nfamily knowledge and abilities to solve and help to organize effective services for the child and \nfamily.  Number of family team meetings at key decision points: \nQuantitative or \n \nQualitative Measure \na.  For children newly entering placement, the number/percent who have a family team meeting \nwithin 30 days of entry. \nb.  For all other children in placement, the number/percent who have at least one family team \nmeeting each quarter. \nc.  Family Teamwork\n \n \na.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held prior to or within 30 days of entry for 90% of new \nentries and 90% of pre-placements. \nFinal Target  b.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held for 90% of children at least once per quarter. \nc.  By June 30, 2011, 90% of cases show evidence in QR of acceptable team formation and \nfunctioning. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 57 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 66 of 186 PageID: 7163\n \n \nPerformance as of March 31, 2013: \n \nDCF did not meet the final target requiring FTMs for 90 percent of families prior to or within 30 \ndays of a child entering foster care, for re-placements, and at least once per quarter thereafter.   \n \nDuring this reporting period DCF initiated intensive efforts to better understand and validate the \nlegitimate reasons why FTMs do not occur, either because the family is unavailable or because a \nparent declined to attend.  In an effort to verify DCF’s FTM data in this reporting period, the \nMonitor reviewed 40 cases in which DCF reported that FTMs did not occur due to the parent \nbeing unavailable or unwilling to participate; the Monitor could not find documentation in the \nrecord to support DCP&P’s data in a number of cases.71 As a result, data reported for this \nmonitoring period only includes information on FTMs that actually occurred and does not \nexclude from the universe the reported number of FTMs in which the parent was unavailable or \nthe parent declined to attend, a change from previous reporting periods.  This revised \nmethodology was also used to recalculate Period XII data to reflect the progress that has been \nmade in initial FTMs completed, from 35 percent in June 2012 (Period XII) to 56 percent in \nMarch 2013 (Period XIII). \n \nAccording to NJ SPIRIT data, in March 2013, out of 358 possible FTMs, 200 (56%) occurred \nwithin 30 days of removal; from July 2012 to March 2013, monthly performance ranged from 34 \nto 57 percent.  The state’s performance on FTMs that occurred (without excluding from the \nuniverse FTMs where the parent was unavailable or declined to participate) has significantly \nimproved from the previous monitoring period, as described above.72  \n \nPerformance on quarterly FTMs also improved. Using the same methodology and reporting only \non FTMs that actually occurred, in March 2013, out of a possible 1,758 FTMs, 815 (46%) \noccurred; from July 2012 to March 2013, monthly performance ranged from 30 to 46 percent.73 \n \nDuring the next monitoring period, the Monitor and DCF plan to conduct a statistically valid \ncase record review to more fully understand the practice and documentation issues concerning \nhow to document and legitimately exclude from performance measure calculation those cases \nwhere parents were unavailable or declined to participate in FTMs. Once the Monitor is satisfied \n                                                 \n71 The Monitor reviewed 22 cases from March 2013 in which data designated as the “parent unavailable” and 18 \ncases designated as “FTM declined.” Two additional cases were reviewed and determined to be incorrectly \ncategorized: one in which the FTM had occurred and one in which DCP&P did not have custody of the youth. Of \nthe remaining 20 cases designated as “parent unavailable,” the Monitor was able to find documentation for only four \n(20%) cases demonstrating they were appropriately categorized as “parent unavailable.” In 16 (80%), cases the \nMonitor did not find information to support the “parent unavailable” designation. Of the 18 cases designated as \n“FTM declined,” the Monitor found documentation that five (28%) were appropriately categorized and the \nremaining 13 (72%) did not have sufficient documentation to categorize them as “FTM declined.” \n72 In June 2012, out of 311 possible FTMs, 109 (35%) of FTMs occurred within 30 days of removal. For the \npurposes of comparison, these data have been recalculated for Monitoring Period XII using the same methodology \nas was used for the March 2013 data; cases designated as “parent unavailable” and “parent declined” were not \nexcluded from the universe due to the data verification issues discussed above. \n73 In June 2012, out of a possible 1,581 FTMs, 526 (33%) occurred quarterly. This data differs from what was \nreported in the Monitoring Period XII as it does not exclude cases designated as “parent unavailable” and “parent \ndeclined” due to the data verification issues discussed above. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

For cases rated as unacceptable, there was evidence in most cases of initial team \nformation but less effective ongoing functioning to support the case goals and/or some critical \nmembers of a necessary team were not involved.  \n \nResults of 107 cases reviewed from July 2012 to March 2013 using the QR indicate that both \nteam formation and functioning were rated acceptable in 24 percent of cases, a decline of six \npercent from the previous reporting period.74   \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n74 26 of 107 cases (24%) rated acceptable on both areas of Family Teamwork, team formation and team functioning; \n36 of 107 cases (34%) rated acceptable on team formation; and 28 of 107 cases (26%) cases rated acceptable on \nteam functioning. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The state’s performance has demonstrated significant improvement during this \nreporting period. Various strategies have been employed to produce this improvement, including \nweekly conferences between DCF leadership, Area Directors and their Local Office managers to \nreview individual worker and office performance on specific measures, including case plans. \nDCF also reports that performance improved due to clarifications to policy on how case plans are \ndocumented in NJ SPIRIT. Appendix B-4 provides performance data on initial case plan \ndevelopment by Local Office. Performance improved dramatically during this monitoring \nperiod; by February and March 2013, DCF met and exceeded the 95 percent performance final \ntarget for the first time (see Figure 8). Overall, the Monitor considers DCF’s performance over \nthis monitoring period to partially fulfill the MSA requirement as the final target was met two \nmonths this monitoring period. As case plans are conducted more routinely, it will be important \nfor DCF to emphasize their quality so that case plans more consistently meet the needs of \nchildren and families and to make sure this improvement is sustained. \n \nQuantitative or  10.

As Figure 10 \nindicates, DCF did not meet the target requiring that 90 percent of cases rate at least minimally \nacceptable on case planning and service plans as measured by the QR. DCF results of 107 cases \nreviewed from July 2012 through March 2013 indicate that 39 percent of cases were rated at \nleast minimally acceptable on both QR indicators ‘Case Planning Process’ and ‘Tracking and \nAdjusting’.76 This represents a nine percent decline in performance from the previous monitoring \nperiod and is a concern.  While the timely completion of case plans is a significant \naccomplishment, DCF staff must now focus with equal intensity on the quality of the case plans \nand the case planning process. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n76 42 of 107 rated cases (39%) rated acceptable on both the Case Planning Process and Tracking and Adjusting \nindicators; 45 of 107 cases (42%) rated acceptable on Case Planning Process; and 64 of 107 cases (60%) rated \nacceptable on Tracking and Adjusting. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Performance Measures Related to Safety and Risk Assessment \n \nIndividualized, comprehensive assessment is a process in which information concerning the \nneeds, problems, circumstances and resources of the family, youth and children are collected, \nevaluated and updated at key points of decision-making and whenever major changes in family \ncircumstances occur.  The decision to close a case should reflect the achievement of satisfactory \noutcomes with regard to the children or youth's safety, permanence and well-being.  An \nassessment of both safety and risk prior to case closure is necessary to ensure these outcomes \nhave been achieved. \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n77Although 107 cases were reviewed for the QR, only 44 involved children over the age of 5 and out-of-home \nplacement. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Safety and Risk Assessment:  Number/percent of closed cases where a safety and risk of harm \nQualitative Measure  assessment is done prior to case closure. \nBy December 31, 2010, (a) 98% of investigations will have a safety assessment completed, (b) 98% of \nFinal Target  investigations will have a risk assessment completed and (c) 98% of non-investigation cases will have a \nrisk assessment or risk re-assessment completed within 30 days of case closure.78 \n \nPerformance as of March 31, 2013: \n \nPerformance during the months of July 2012 through March 2013 for both safety and risk \nassessments completed prior to investigation completion exceeded the 98 percent required by the \nfinal target.   For example, in March 2013, there were 5,106 applicable79 investigation cases \nclosed.  Of these 5,106 investigations, 5,105 (100%) investigations had a safety assessment \ncompleted prior to investigation completion and 5,105 (100%) investigations had a risk \nassessment completed prior to investigation completion. \n \nPerformance on conducting a risk reassessment 30 days prior to case closure ranged from 45 to \n59 percent (see Figure 12) between the months of July 2012 through March 2013. For example, \nin March 2013, there were 1,698 applicable80 cases closed. Of these 1,698 cases, 1,000 (59%) \ncases had a risk reassessment completed within 30 days prior to case closure; 254 (15%) cases \nhad a risk reassessment completed within 31 to 60 days prior to case closure.81  Data by Local \nOffice for March 2013 reflects a wide performance range between 31 and 83 percent (see \nAppendix B-1)82 among offices with no Local Office meeting the performance required by the \nfinal target. To address this issue in the short term, DCF added a “pop up” box to NJ SPIRIT to \nremind staff that the risk reassessment is required prior to case closure.  This change was \nimplemented on March 26, 2013.  Subsequently, a hard edit was added to NJ SPIRIT on May 23, \n2013 that now requires a risk reassessment be completed before the NJ SPIRIT system will allow \nstaff to close a case.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n78 In order to be consistent with practice expectations, in May 2012, the Parties agreed to revise the final target from, \n“By December 31, 2010, 98% of cases will have a safety and risk of harm assessment completed prior to case \nclosure” to the language stated above, which allows for separate reporting on investigations and non-investigations \ncases.   \n79 In March 2013, an additional 35 investigations were closed; however, those cases were marked as “unable to \nmake contact with children/family” and were excluded from the calculations. \n80 Applicable cases include reunification and do not include adoption, kinship legal guardianship or emancipation. \n81 In March 2013, 95 (6%) cases had a risk reassessment completed within 61 to 90 days prior to case closure; and \n320 (19%) cases had a risk reassessment completed over 91 days prior to case closure.  \n82 Cases assigned to adoption workers are included in Appendix B-1 only for the few cases where the goal of the \nchild in placement was changed from adoption to reunification. Prior to case closure, the Adoption worker is \nrequired to complete a risk reassessment for those cases when the child exits to reunification.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Performance Measures on Caseworker, Parent-Child and Sibling Visits \n \nThe visits of children with their caseworkers, parents and siblings are integral to the principles of \nthe CPM and are important events that can ensure children’s safety, maintain and strengthen \nfamily connections, and increase children’s opportunities to achieve permanency.   \n \nThe state’s performance for all MSA visitation measures has demonstrated improvement, some \nsubstantial, during this nine month monitoring period.  One strategy implemented by DCF which \nhas likely contributed to these improvements are weekly conferences held between a member of \nDCF Commissioner’s staff, Area Directors and their Local Office managers to review individual \nperformance on specific measures, including visitation.  DCF reports that these conferences \nfocus attention on Local Office performance and on assessing workloads to ensure adequate \nplanning and supervision.  Additionally, in early 2013, the Director of DCP&P held meetings \nwith Area Directors who were required to submit performance improvement plans for specific \nmeasures where performance was low. \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Additionally, as discussed more fully in \nthis section, the Monitor validated data using a small sample of cases for two visitation measures \n(Measure 16—caseworker visits with children in state custody and Measure 20—visitation \nbetween children in custody and their parents) during this monitoring period.

Recruitment and Licensure of Resource Family Homes  \n \nDCF reports that it continues to maintain a resource family home placement capacity in excess of \ncurrent need, allowing choices for every child in placement.  At the same time, the state \nrecognizes the need to recruit and license more specialized homes, such as large capacity \nresource family homes and homes for adolescents.  \n \nDCF recruited and licensed 1,345 new kinship and non-kinship resource family homes from \nJanuary 1 to December 31, 2012, exceeding its target for CY 2012 by 76 families.

Participants include local and area resource family unit staff, licensing inspectors and \nOffice of Resource Families (ORF) staff. Also Office of Licensing (OOL) intake and ORF \nsupervisors meet regularly to discuss new policies and quality case practice.  DCF continues to \nfind that this monthly conferencing model assists in identifying practice issues to resolving \napplications within 150 days. A new Impact Meeting Workgroup was formed during the \nreporting period that convenes participants from Local Office resource family units, area \nresource family specialists and staff from OOL and ORF. The workgroup is charged with \nmaking recommendations to improve compliance with the 150 day application process and how \nbest to utilize resource family impact teams.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As previously reported, the \nstate developed and has been using a specialized recruitment strategy to focus attention on \nidentifying, recruiting and licensing these homes, termed “Siblings in Best Settings” or SIBS. At \nthe end of this reporting period, DCF had 25 SIBS homes, a net increase of one home from the \nprevious monitoring period; fifteen SIBS homes were newly licensed between July 1, 2012 and \nMarch 31, 2013.96  \n \nNew Jersey continues to pursue recruitment and retention strategies that seek to locate and \nretain quality resource parents, including a new focus on improving local capacity. \n \nRecruitment and Retention \n \nDCF continues to emphasize and support locally based recruitment activities in communities \nwhere children reside. Recruitment staff hold bi-monthly meetings to provide forums to discuss \nideas, challenges and successful recruitment activities. DCF developed two new roles to enhance \nrecruitment efforts: a Recruitment and Retention Specialist to focus on communication and \nmarketing and a Statewide Retention Specialist to further support resource families and improve \noverall customer service. Specific statewide recruitment events were held that focused on the \nneed for families for adolescents and sibling groups.  \n \nDCF continued its work with the National Resource Center for Recruitment and Retention of \nFoster and Adoptive Parents at Adopt US Kids (NRCRRFAP) using a marketing research tool \nthat helps identify households by geographic area and select economic indicators that are most \nsimilar to those in which DCF is currently successful in placing children. The purpose of the tool \nis to find new ways to reach and successfully penetrate target markets. The tool was piloted in \nMercer and Essex counties during this monitoring reporting period. \n \nStaff Training and Skill Development \n \nOver 170 resource family and licensing staff participated in training opportunities during this \nmonitoring period, including:  \n \n  Two-Day Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) Training—this is a two-day \nmandatory training required of all SAFE practitioners, resource family staff who conduct \nhome studies using the SAFE model.  \n                                                 \n96 Fourteen homes left the SIBS program; four remain open to take additional children that are not large capacity \nsibling groups.  The remaining ten families closed their homes; six of the families closed their homes as a result of \nadoption of a sibling group and one family closed their home because the resource parents were unable to commit to \na permanency plan.  Another family closed its home due to health reasons and an additional two families closed \ntheir homes due to IAIU investigations. \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

REPEAT MALTREATMENT AND RE-ENTRY INTO CARE \n \nThe state is responsible for ensuring the safety of children who are receiving or have received \nservices from DCP&P.  This responsibility includes ensuring the safety of children who are \nplaced in resource family homes and congregate facilities.  As detailed below, the MSA includes \na number of measures on repeat maltreatment, maltreatment while in care and re-entry into care.  \nGiven this is a longitudinal measure, the most recent data available for repeat maltreatment and \nre-entry into foster care are from CY 2011.   \n \n \nAbuse and Neglect of Children in Foster Care \n \n30.

As of December 31, 2012, of the 5,272 \nchildren, 412 (7.8%) children were the victims of a substantiated allegation of child abuse and/or \nneglect within 12 months of the initial substantiation. 103  Although DCF has previously met this \nmeasure consistently since CY 2007, the most recent performance for CY 2011 does not meet \nthe MSA final target of no more than 7.2 percent.      \n \n \nQuantitative or  32.  Repeat Maltreatment:  Of all children who are reunified during a period, the percentage who are \nQualitative Measure  victims of substantiated abuse or neglect within one year after the date of reunification. \nFor the period beginning July 2009 and thereafter, no more than 4.8% of children who reunified will be \nFinal Target \nthe victims of substantiated abuse or neglect within one year after reunification. \n \nPerformance as of CY 2011 (Most Recent Calendar Year Available):  \n \nIn CY 2011, there were 3,202 children who were returned home or to a family member after a \nstay in out-of-home placement; 269 (8.4%) were the victims of a substantiated allegation of \nabuse and/or neglect within 12 months of their return home. This rate of repeat maltreatment \ncontinues to exceed the MSA final target, that no more than 4.8 percent of children who \nreunified will be victims of substantiated abuse and/or neglect within one year after reunification \nand represents a concerning increase of 2.4 percent since CY 2010.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n103 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates.  There has been a slight change in methodology in analyzing data for \nCY 2011.  Performance for calendar years prior to 2011 was analyzed by assessing the date of the initial \nsubstantiated report to the date of the subsequent substantiated report.  Performance for CY 2011 was analyzed by \nassessing the date of the initial substantiated report to the date of the subsequent incident which resulted in a \nsubstantiation of abuse or neglect.  DCF has indicated that the recent decline in performance is not attributable to the \nmethodology change.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CY 2011 data \nanalyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates.   \n \nPerformance as of CY 2011 (Most Recent Calendar Year Available):  \n \nIn CY 2011, there were 5,245 children who exited foster care; 3,585 (68%) children exited to \nqualifying exits (i.e., reunification, guardianship or to a relative placement).104,105  Of the 3,585 \nchildren who exited to qualifying exits, 459 (13%) children re-entered placement as of December \n31, 2012.  While the percentage of children re-entering care has slightly declined since CY 2007, \nrecent performance does not meet the final target of no more than nine percent of children who \nexit will re-enter custody within one year.    \n                                                 \n104 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates. \n105 DCF has objected to the Monitor’s definition of “qualifying exits” used to analyze this measure.  The Agency \nbelieves that due to the specific exclusion cited in the MSA, the definition of qualifying exits should only exclude \nchildren who run away from placement.  The Monitor uses a definition of qualifying exits which excludes from the \ncalculations runaways as well as children who are adopted.  Based on the DCF recommended definition, of all \nchildren who exited in CY 2011, nine percent re-entered custody within one year of the date of exit.  Using that \ndefinition, DCF calculates performance for previous years as follows: CY 2007, 12%; CY 2008, 10%; CY 2009, \n10%; CY 2010, 9%.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

TIMELY PERMANENCY THROUGH REUNIFICATION, ADOPTION OR \nLEGAL GUARDIANSHIP \n \nAll children—regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity—need and deserve a safe, nurturing \nfamily to protect and guide them. In child welfare work, this is called achieving “permanency.” \nPermanency can be achieved through a number of different avenues; safe family reunification is \nthe preferred choice, but permanency also includes kinship legal guardianship and adoption.  \nThe MSA requires that children in custody achieve timely permanency through reunification, \nadoption or legal guardianship (Section III.A.2.a).   \n \nThe MSA permanency measures reflect an expectation that children entering custody will attain \npermanency in a timely manner through whatever is their most appropriate permanency pathway.  \nThe measures were designed to avoid creating unintended incentives in favor of one permanency \npath (e.g., reunification or adoption) over another.  The measures also seek to examine \nperformance and set realistic permanency expectations and timeframes for children who have \nnewly entered foster care and how long they remain in care as well as for those children and \nyouth who have been in care for extended periods of time.   \n \nThe state’s performance on these measures is based on the calendar year and the most recent data \nare presented below.  Overall, DCF’s performance in discharging children to permanency has \nremained stable or declined and does not meet the final targets required by the MSA.  Of \nparticular concern is permanency for children in foster care for 24 months or longer where \nDCF’s performance for CY 2012 is 14 percentage points below the MSA target.    \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This performance does not meet the final target \nrequirement of 60 percent and has declined slightly since CY 2011.   \n \nPermanency Through Adoption \n \nIn addition to the adoption outcome measures that rely on annual data for the previous 12 \nmonths, the Monitor analyzes DCF’s adoption practice by reviewing the number of adoptions \nfinalized and related adoption case processes, such as the timeliness with which petitions to \nterminate parental rights have been filed, child-specific recruitment plans have been developed, \nchildren have been placed in an adoptive home and an adoptive home placement has been \nfinalized.   \n \nBetween January 1 and December 31, 2012 DCF finalized 943 adoptions.116 \n \nBetween January 1 and December 31, 2012, 943 children were adopted, 130 more children than \nwere targeted for the year.  As of January 1, 2013, 1,020 children were legally free for adoption, \nand 1,171 children were legally free for adoption as of March 31, 2013.117  Table 14 shows the \nnumber of adoption finalizations by DCP&P Local Office between January 1 and December 31, \n2012. \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n115 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates. \n116 The number of adoption finalizations is a measure that is monitored on a calendar year basis; the target numbers \nare based on the number of legally free children and an estimated number of resolved appeals. Historically the \nnumber of adoption finalizations that occur in the first quarter are lower than the rest of the year so the first quarter \nof the year does not accurately reflect progress. \n117 Not every legally free child is eligible to move toward adoption as some court decisions that terminate parental \nrights are appealed.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN OUT-OF-HOME PLACEMENT \n \nThe provision of appropriate health care services to children in DCF’s custody has been a \nprincipal focus of the MSA and the DCF’s reform agenda.  Since June 2011, DCF has \nmaintained or improved performance on nearly all Performance Measures related to health care \nservices.119  These Performance Measures track DCF’s progress in ensuring that children in out-\nof-home placement receive: \n \n  Pre-placement medical assessments (MSA Section II.F.5); \n  Full medical examinations (known as Comprehensive Medical Examinations or \nCMEs) (MSA Section II.B.11); \n  Medical examinations in compliance with Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis \nand Treatment (EPSDT) guidelines; \n  Semi-annual dental examinations for children ages three and older (MSA Section \nII.F.2); \n  Mental health assessments of children with suspected mental health needs (MSA \nSection II.F.2); \n  Timely, accessible and appropriate follow-up and treatment (MSA Section II.F.2); \nand \n  Immunizations. \n \nThis section provides updates of ongoing efforts to improve policies, staffing and access to \nservices, which are necessary to realize and sustain positive health outcomes for children as well \nas information about the health care received by children in out-of-home placement.120  The \ndelivery of a child’s medical information (through the Health Passport) to a new caregiver within \nfive days of placement in his/her home is also assessed. \n \nAlthough not used to directly assess MSA compliance, DCF’s QR found that 99 percent of cases \nscored at least minimally acceptable on the provision of health care services, a finding consistent \nwith performance on the measures discussed below. \n \nDCF regularly carries out a Health Care Case Record Review that analyzes the follow-up care \nchildren receive for concerns identified in CMEs; mental health screenings, assessments and \nfollow-up care; and timely delivery of the health passport to resource parents.  Because these \nreviews are labor intensive and consistently done every six months, the Monitor did not require a \nspecial review, given the extended monitoring period, to assess performance through March \n2013.  The most recent case record review includes a random sample of children in out-of-home \nplacement who were removed between May 1 and October 31, 2012 and were in care a \n                                                 \n119 The one exception is the performance measure requiring 95 percent of caregivers receive a current Health \nPassport within five days of a child’s placement where performance as of December 2012 is 63 percent. \n120 The Monitor has previously verified health care outcomes through a case record review.

Thus, for the health care Performance Measures based on case record \nreview findings, performance is reported through December 2012. \n \nA.  Health Care Delivery System \n \nChild Health Units \n \nThe Child Health Units are a fundamental cornerstone of the provision of health care to children \nin DCP&P custody.  These units are in each DCP&P Local Office and are staffed with a clinical \nnurse coordinator, Health Care Case Managers (nurses) and staff assistants based on the \nprojected number of children in out-of-home placement.  A regional nurse administrator \nsupervises local units for a particular region (aligned with the Area Offices).  DCF worked with \nUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey’s School of Nursing’s François-Xavier \nBagnoud Center (FXB)121 and DCP&P Local Offices to build these units.  As part of their duties, \nthese staff members are responsible for tracking and advocating for the health needs of children \nwho enter into out-of-home care.  Since the creation of health care units and assignment of \nnurses to children in out-of-home care, DCF has achieved and sustained substantial results.   \n \nThe Child Health Units are operational in all DCP&P Local Offices.  Staffing levels remain \nconsistent.  As of March 31, 2013, there were 187 Health Care Case Managers and 103 staff \nassistants statewide.  DCF works to ensure that the ratio of Health Care Case Managers to \nchildren in out-of-home care is 1 to 50 in every Local Office.   \n \n \nB.

Pre-Placement Medical Assessment:  Number/percent of children receiving pre-placement medical \nQualitative Measure  assessment in a non-emergency room setting or other setting appropriate to the situation.122 \nBy December 31, 2009, 98% of children will receive a pre-placement assessment either in a non \nFinal Target  emergency room setting, or in an emergency room setting if the child needed emergency medical \nattention or the child was already in the emergency room when DCP&P received the referral. \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n121 As of July 1, 2013, the University of Medicine and Dentistry merged with Rutgers, The State University of New \nJersey. The UMDNJ-School of Nursing is now Rutgers School of Nursing. \n122 By agreement of the Parties, this measure has been redrafted to combine the percentage of PPAs in a non-ER \nsetting and those PPAs conducted in an ER that are appropriate based on the presenting medical needs of the \nchild/youth or because the child/youth was already in the ER when DCP&P received the referral.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Child Health Unit nurses, clinics and sometimes the child’s own pediatrician provide \nthese assessments. \n \nFrom July 2012 to March 2013, 3,924 children entered out-of-home placement and 3,912 \n(100%)123 of them received a pre-placement assessment (PPA).  Of those 3,912 children, 3,367 \n(86%) received the PPA in a non-emergency room setting with the remaining 545 children (14%) \nreceiving a PPA in an emergency room setting due to the medical needs and situation of the \nchild.  \n \nDuring this period, DCF conducted an internal review of all 545 PPAs that occurred in an \nemergency room and determined that 496 (91%) were appropriate for the situation; that is, the \nchild needed emergency medical attention or the child was already in the emergency room when \nDCP&P received the referral.124  Thus, 99 percent of children received a PPA in a setting \n                                                 \n123 Percentage is 100 due to rounding. \n124 In monitoring Period XII, the Monitor reviewed back-up data provided by DCF regarding the PPAs occurring in \nan emergency room setting and agreed with DCF determinations regarding appropriate or inappropriate use of the \nER for PPAs.  In addition, the Monitor’s previous Health Care Case Record Review found that many of the PPAs \noccurring in an ER were because the child had an injury requiring ER treatment or had been brought to the ER by \nthe police or other service provider. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

A CME involves a \ncomprehensive physical, including a developmental history and evaluation, and an initial mental \nhealth screening.126  Mental health screenings determine if a child has a suspected mental health \nneed.127 If a child is suspected to have a mental health need, a full mental health evaluation is \nthen expected to be conducted.  \n \nAfter reviewing the data and discussion with DCF, the Monitor has excluded data for children \nwho entered out-of-home care in the month of October.  DCF provided relevant information that \nas a direct result of Superstorm Sandy medical providers were unavailable (temporarily shut \n                                                 \n126 Previously, the state relied on the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for Children (CHEC) model as the sole \nvehicle to comprehensively assess the health care needs of these children.  CHEC examinations require a three part \nexamination: medical, neurodevelopmental and mental health assessments, which can only be administered by a \nlimited number of medical providers in New Jersey.  CHEC examinations still take place and are considered a type \nof CME.  CMEs are now also provided through other community-based medical providers.   \n127 In addition to the expectation that mental health screenings occur as part of the CME, DCF directs Health Care \nCase Managers to conduct mental health screenings with children in out-of-home placements who are age two and \nabove and not already receiving mental health services.  Health Care Case Managers conduct these screenings \nwithin the first two weeks of a child’s placement.     \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Ninety-three percent of children age two and above also received the required \nEPSDT well-child examinations (see Tables 19 and 20).  This performance is similar to previous \nmonitoring periods and is slightly below the MSA final target of 98 percent of children in care \nfor one year or more receiving timely EPSDT well-child examinations.128 However, in the \nMonitor’s judgment, this performance demonstrates sustained access to health care for children \nin out-of-home care.  \n \nNJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures provide reports on when a child receives an EPSDT examination, \nbut neither have the ability to determine whether or not a child is clinically up-to-date with these \nexams. A child may be noted in NJ SPIRIT as not up-to-date if at the EPSDT visit the child was \nsick (children must be well for such visits to be considered EPSDT visits) or the visit was \nmissed, but rescheduled within a close time period.  Also, especially notable for younger \nchildren, once a child is off schedule, they will remain off schedule within DCF’s data system for \nall subsequent EPSDT exams.  Therefore, in an effort to determine the actual receipt of an \nEPSDT exam, DCF conducted a secondary review of all the records of children noted as “not \ncurrent with their EPSDT exams” and found more children were clinically up-to-date on their \nEPSDT exam than reported in NJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures.129   \n \n \nTable 19:  EPSDT for Children Ages 12-24 months \n(July 2012 – March 2013) \n \nChildren Requiring  Children  % Children \nMonth \nEPSDT  Up-to-Date  Up-to-Date \nJULY 2012  88  82  93% \nAUGUST 2012  104  94  90% \nSEPTEMBER 2012  91  83  91% \nOCTOBER 2012  102  98  96% \nNOVEMBER 2012  110  102  93% \nDECEMBER 2012  116  107  92% \nJANUARY 2013  94  86  92% \nFEBRUARY 2013  105  100  95% \nMARCH 2013  127  117  92% \nTotal  937  869  93% \nSource:  DCF data produced by Child Health Unit\n                                                 \n128 As the measure involves children in out-of-home placement for one year or more, performance for children under \nthe age of 12 months is not measured by the Monitor. \n129 The Monitor did not review the back-up data this monitoring period but has confidence in the review as the \nMonitor has previously examined the back-up data of this secondary review for children age 12 to 24 months and \nfound DCF’s secondary review adequate to determine if children in the age range were clinically up-to-date on their \nEPSDT exam.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF’s performance remains similar to the previous three monitoring periods and is \nbelow the final target by five percent.  The dental care measure includes targets for annual and \nsemi-annual dental exams.  Because the performance expectation for field staff is to ensure that \nchildren age three or older receive semi-annual dental exams, DCF had been solely measuring \nwhether children receive dental exams semi-annually.  DCF also provided annual data on this \nmeasure which show that 98 percent of children three and older in care for at least six months \nbetween July 1 and December 31, 2012 had an annual dental exam.130  Thus the Monitor \nconsiders DCF to have partially fulfilled this Performance Measure.  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2012, DCF reports that there were 4,000 children age three or older who had \nbeen in DCP&P out-of-home placement for at least six month; 3,406 (85%) had received a dental \nexamination within the previous six months and an additional 517 (13%) had received an annual \ndental examination, thus there was evidence that 98 percent of children aged three and older had \nat least an annual dental examination.  From July through December 2012, monthly performance \non current semi-annual dental examinations ranged from 85 to 88 percent.

Data for December 2012 represents performance \nfor children in out-of-home placement who were removed between May 1 and October 31, 2012 and were \nin care for a minimum of 60 days. \n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2012: \n \nThe data on health care follow-up is based on DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record review of \na random sample of children in out-of-home placement who were removed between May 1 and \nOctober 31, 2012 and were in care for a minimum of 60 days. Based on multiple assessments by \nthe Monitor of DCF’s Health Care Case Record review and the results of the statewide \nQualitative Review, the Monitor believes that the medical follow-up care and treatment of \nchildren is accurately measured through DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record review.131   \n \nDCF reports that of those children identified as needing follow-up care after their CME, 95 \npercent received the recommended follow-up care. As stated previously, mental health \nscreenings are not routinely documented as part of the CME, but Health Care Case Managers \nhelp to ensure that children in out-of-home placement receive needed mental health services.  \nTherefore, the Monitor considers this follow-up care data with the caveat that mental health \nneeds requiring follow-up may not have been fully identified or documented as part of the CME \nfor some children.132 \n \n                                                 \n131 The Monitor did not independently verify the findings of DCF’s Health Care Case Record Review during this \nMonitoring Period.  However, the Monitor did review the protocol and observe a day of the review.  The \nmethodology and analysis remain comparable to the Health Care Case Record review conducted by the Monitor in \nspring 2009. \n132 The Monitor thus looks to performance measure 46 to measure whether children and youth receive mental health \nscreenings, and whether those with a suspected mental health need receive assessments. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Christie  Page 125 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 317   Filed 10/03/13   Page 134 of 186 PageID: 7231\n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2012: \n \nUnder the MSA, all children entering out-of-home care are to have a Health Passport created for \nthem (Section II.F.8).  This Health Passport records all relevant health history and current health \nstatus of the child and is expected to be regularly updated and made available to resource \nparents, children (if old enough) and their parents.   \n \nBased on DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record Review of 350 cases, there is evidence that \nHealth Passports are shared with the child’s caregiver within the first five days of placement in \n63 percent of cases (see Table 22).  This performance does not meet the final performance target \nbut represents an increase over the last monitoring period when 58 percent of caregivers received \nHealth Passports within five days.  Within 30 days of the placement, DCF data show the Health \nPassport has been shared with 96 percent of caregivers, consistent with performance from the \nlast monitoring period.   \n \nThe Health Passport organizes health information from a range of sources including any findings \nof the PPA.  DCF policy requires that the Health Care Case Manager complete the Health \nPassport, which is maintained by the DCP&P Local Office Child Health Unit, and provide it to \nthe resource parent within 72 hours of the child’s placement.  This is a more stringent policy than \nthe MSA requirement that the Health Passport be conveyed to the child’s caregiver within five \ndays.  DCF continues to be unable to consistently meet its internal timeframe or the five day \nrequirement set in the MSA, and there is concern that Health Passports produced within 72 \nhours, or even five days, frequently cannot contain meaningful medical information.  The \nMonitor and parties have met to discuss this measure and consider whether a more effective \nmeasure can be designed that assesses how and in what timeframes meaningful medical \ninformation about children can reasonably be collected and timely shared with their caregivers.  \nNo agreement has been reached as of this time.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

MENTAL HEALTH CARE \n \nDCF continues to work on improving its mental health delivery system.  During this monitoring \nperiod, DCF expanded the number and type of children served and, through its federal Medicaid \nwaiver, will be positioned to provide greater access to behavioral and mental health services for \nchildren and youth as discussed further below.  Further, the Center for Health Care Strategies, a \nnonprofit health policy resource center based in New Jersey, awarded DCF a technical assistance \ngrant to participate with five other states in a Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement \nCollaborative. New Jersey’s goals in receiving this technical assistance include increasing policy \ncompliance and developing frameworks to review the progress of individual children/youth as \nwell as children/ youth at-risk for needing psychotropic medication. In June 2013, New Jersey \npresented a webinar on Models of Agency Consent for Psychotropic Medications for Children \nand Youth in Child Welfare.137  \n  \nDCF continues to meet the MSA Performance Measures requiring that children receive timely \nmental health assessments and children and youth received appropriate, evidence-based mental \nhealth services that could prevent their entry into DCP&P custody. \n \nA.  Mental Health Delivery System \n \nDCF’s Division of Children's System of Care (CSOC) serves children and adolescents with \nemotional, behavioral health, developmental and intellectual disabilities and co-occurring \nconditions.  Beginning in 2012, the provision of services to children with developmental and \nintellectual disabilities, formerly under the purview of the Department of Human Services \n(DHS), transitioned to CSOC. The first phase of this transition occurred in October 2012 when \napproximately 450 children and youth with developmental and intellectual disabilities receiving \nout-of-home placement and intensive in-home services were transitioned to CSOC.  Several new \nservices were developed and implemented including awarding two contracts to expand out-of-\nhome treatment for children with developmental disabilities, a five bed psychiatric community \nhome and a five bed intensive residential treatment services home.   \n \nThe second phase of the transition, involving 15,000 children and youth, began on January 1, \n2013 and represented the transfer of Developmental Disability (DD) Family Support Services to \nDCF.  DD Family Support Services include respite, camp and assistive technology and support \nfor the family to care for the child or youth within their home.  Care coordination for these \nchildren and youth is provided by PerformCare and DCF’s network of Care Management \nOrganizations (CMOs).  PerformCare provides 24 hour, 7 day a week access to service requests, \nmanages the utilization of service contracts and provides the first step in determining eligibility \n                                                 \n137 Section III.C.2 of the MSA requires the State to promulgate and implement policies designed to ensure that \npsychotropic medication is not used as a means of discipline or control and that the use of physical restraint is \nminimized. This is a Phase I requirement that DCF has maintained since January 2010. Child Health Unit (CHU) \nnurses are continuing to monitor children/youth on psychotropic medication. Data that CHUs maintain include the \ndiagnosis of the child/youth; prescription and over the counter medications; medication dosage(s); prescriber name \nand credentials; informed consent documentation; treatment plans; and engagement in non-pharmacological \ntherapies. CHU psychotropic medication data are submitted to the Office of Child and Family Health on a quarterly \nbasis for review and analysis.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CSOC retains responsibility for the final determination of DD \neligibility.   \n \nAlso new this monitoring period, in October 2012 New Jersey received approval from the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for a Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver \nfocused, in part, on increasing supports for children and youth who have a risk of hospital level \ncare (children/youth considered to be seriously emotionally disturbed), have a pervasive \ndevelopmental disability, or are developmentally delayed and mentally ill.138 Some aspects of the \nwaiver will be implemented in the summer and fall of 2013.  CSOC believes that the waiver will \npermit them to improve timely access and relevant care that integrates physical as well as mental \nhealth care.  The Monitor will track the implementation and effectiveness of this waiver as it \nrelates to requirements of the MSA.  \n \nThe number of children placed out-of-state for treatment continued to decline. \n \nDCF is required to minimize the number of children in DCP&P custody placed in out-of-state \ncongregate care settings and to work on transitioning these children back to New Jersey (Section \nII.D.2). As of March 2013, there were three youth in out-of-state residential placements. All \nthree youth are in a specialized program for the deaf or hard of hearing.  DCF is working \ncollaboratively with the state’s Department of Education, primarily with staff of New Jersey’s \nMarie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, to develop an in-state program to provide residential \nmental health treatment for five to eight youth. Program services will be provided by St. Joseph’s \nHospital and Medical Center.  The facility is undergoing updates and renovations and DCF \nhopes to move the three youth from out-of-state to the new facility by the end of 2013 if the \nrenovations have been completed.   \n   \nFigure 50 shows the number of children placed out-of-state from June 2011 to May 2013.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n138 Other provisions of the Medicaid waiver support seniors and adults with disabilities and low income families. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SERVICES TO PREVENT ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE AND TO SUPPORT \nREUNIFICATION AND PERMANENCY \n \n \nContinued Support for Family Success Centers \n \nQuantitative or  48. Continued Support for Family Success Centers: DCF shall continue to support statewide network \nQualitative Measure  of Family Success Centers. \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \nPerformance as of March 31, 2013: \n \nNew Jersey began developing a network of Family Success Centers (FSCs) in 2007, initially \nwith 21 centers.  Now, in its fifth full year, New Jersey has a total of 51 FSCs, at least one in \neach of the 21 counties.   \n \nFSCs are neighborhood-based places where any community resident can access family support, \ninformation and services, and specialized supports that tend to vary depending on the needs and \ndesires of the community in which they are located. Their function is to provide resources and \nsupports before families fall into crisis.  FSCs are situated in many types of settings: storefronts, \nhouses, schools, houses of worship and public housing. Services range from life skills training, \nparent and child activities, advocacy, parent education and housing related activities.  These \nservices are available to any family in the community.  \n \nSince Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 FSCs have become recognized as a significant place of \nsupport for families in New Jersey. They served as referral resources for Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA) Disaster Recovery Centers because they are located in \ncommunities where families needed assistance. Some centers held food and clothing drives and \nrecovery information events.  Additionally, Commissioner Allison Blake identified funding to \nestablish a FSC in Union Beach to work with and service families directly affected by the storm.  \n \nIn total, between July 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, nine new FSCs were established in eight \ncounties: two in Camden and one in each of the following counties: Cumberland, Essex, \nGloucester, Middlesex, Monmouth, Salem and Union.   \n \nTable 25 depicts the ten core services provided by FSCs to families; the total number of services \nprovided to these families – families can receive multiple services – increased by 72 percent \nfrom 13,285 in July 2012 to 22,868 in March 2013, reflecting the need for services brought about \nby Superstorm Sandy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SERVICES TO OLDER YOUTH \n \nDuring Phase I of the MSA, DCF created and promoted policies to provide continued support \nand services to youth aged 18 to 21, including monitoring youth in DCP&P custody until age 21.  \nDiscussed below are several current practices and strategies utilized by DCF to provide services \nfor older youth in the following areas: housing, education, employment, general transition \nsupport and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning or Intersex (LGBTQI) services.  \nMany of these efforts are a result of DCF’s Office of Adolescent Services (OAS) 2011-2014 \nstrategic plan, Striving for Success in Transitions to Adulthood.143  Following the practice and \nstrategy updates, progress toward the Phase II Performance Measures is provided.   \n   \nHousing  \n \nThe OAS has partnered with PerformCare to create the Adolescent Housing Hub, a real-time \nhousing slot tracking and referral system.  DCF reports that this automated system is within \nPerformCare’s CYBER system and allows for the identification of appropriate housing for youth \nby accurately matching the youth’s needs, provider information and program capacity.  As \nindicated in Table 26, as of March 31, 2013, there were 374 transitional and supported housing \noperational slots and during this monitoring period, new housing programs were opened in \nBurlington, Salem and Atlantic counties.  DCF reports that OAS is collecting data related to \nhousing needs of youth across the state to plan and adjust existing housing programs.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n143 The strategic plan can be accessed at: http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/divisions/oas/index.html   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF \nreports the remaining youth did not utilize Scholars program funding because the financial aid \nprovided by their educational institutions covered their expenses.  The number of youth enrolled \nin the Scholars program has remained steady since the 2011-2012 academic year when 316 \nstudents participated and remains below expectations for potentially eligible youth. A case \nrecord review conducted by the Monitor and DCF of the 65 youth who exited care between July \n1 and December 31, 2012 without achieving permanency found that documentation in the record \nindicated that information pertaining to the Scholars program was conveyed to 29 percent of \nyouth and only four youth enrolled in higher education/vocational programs were enrolled in the \nScholars program.   \n \nIn an effort to increase participation in the Scholars program, between July 2012 and March \n2013, 18 workshops were held providing assistance to 114 youth in understanding the Scholars \nprogram and to provide assistance in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \n(FAFSA).  Additionally, information was presented during five “Aging Out” events, reaching \napproximately 270 youth, and four presentations were held for DCF staff, law guardians and \nresources parents with a total of 215 attendees.  Reapplication events on college campuses \ncontaining high concentrations of Scholar participants were scheduled for the late spring and \nearly summer 2013.  The Monitor encourages DCF continually to assess the effectiveness of \ncurrent recruitment efforts as well as enrollment requirements to ensure that youth who can \nbenefit from the Scholars program have access to it.  \n \nTwo additional supports available to youth enrolled in the Scholars program are Project \nMYSELF and the Summer Housing and Internship Program (SHIP).  Project MYSELF is \nrequired for all youth enrolled in the Scholars program and offers a multi-service mentoring \nprogram designed to improve academic performance, increase post-secondary education \nretention and develop essential life skills and competencies.  SHIP is a 12 week program (May \nthrough August) which offers safe and secure housing on four university campuses (Montclair \nUniversity, Rutgers University-Camden, Rutgers University-Newark and Rutgers University-\nNew Brunswick/Piscataway) for youth who lack financial, family and social connections.  In \naddition to housing, other supports are available including paid internship opportunities, \ncounseling, seminars and social activities.  During the summer of 2012, 40 students were served \nthrough SHIP.  A new addition to the SHIP program, referred to as the Summer Internship \nProgram (SIP), was created and began serving an additional 20 youth in May 2013.  Youth \nenrolled in this program do not require housing supports but benefit from internship \nopportunities and access to the other supportive services available in the SHIP program.   \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

One component of this partnership includes \nresource and information sharing with One-Stop Career Centers, Workforce Investment Boards \nand Youth Investment Councils throughout the state.  Another component of the partnership is \nparticipation in the SETC’s Shared Youth Vision Council which brings together stakeholders to \nconstruct a shared vision to guide employment and training services for youth.   \n \nGeneral Transition Support  \n \nDCF received a sponsorship from Kearny Federal Savings Bank to partner with EverFi, an \nonline financial literacy program, to provide services to youth in housing and life skills \nprograms.  This program was piloted in the summer of 2012 and a graduation ceremony was held \nin November 2012 for 40 youth who completed the course.  An unlimited amount of additional \nslots are available for more youth to participate in the future and training is being conducted with \nDCP&P youth serving agencies.   \n \nOn October 1, 2012, the Ansell Casey Life Skills Assessment was replaced with the Casey Life \nSkills Assessment (CLSA) by Casey Family Programs.  OAS has provided guidance to DCP&P \nstaff and contracted providers on changes and updates included in CLSA and on how to set up \nand access user accounts.   \n \nOAS has begun updating many policies pertaining to older youth.  In August 2012, the policy \nregarding credit checks for youth was updated and after much planning and preparation this \nmonitoring period, effective April 1, 2013, DCF updated its Independent Living Stipend policy, \nincreasing the amount of funding available to be more comparable with current standards of \nliving and to appropriately provide support for youth in independent living placements or \nreceiving independent living services.  The previous rate was established in 1979, providing \napproximately $160 a month for food and $180 a month for rent; the new policy provides \neligible youth with $240 a month for food, $600 a month for rent and $100 a month for \nincidentals which includes household and personal care items.   \n \nIn March 2013, OAS began the Adolescent Practice Forums which allow professionals across \nDCF an opportunity to discuss common practice concerns and receive updates on adolescent \nrelated policy, practice and workgroup and task force activities.  Adolescent serving staff within \nthe DCP&P, the Office of Education (OOE) and the Case Management Organizations (CMO) \nserving Children’s System of Care (CSOC) youth.  These forums are offered four times a year in \nregional offices across the state.  The first forum included an overview of resource materials for \nadolescents, status updates on the OAS strategic plan, services offered by OAS and a \npresentation on the Task Force on Helping Youth Thrive in Placement.  The second series was \nheld in June 2013.   \n \nFinally, OAS currently supports 12 Youth Advisory Boards (YABs).  DCF reports that each \nYAB meets twice a month and is responsible for spearheading four programs per year.

OAS is currently \npartnering with the National Resource Center for Youth Services in a significant investment to \ndevelop and implement a restructure to the YABs which would increase the number of YABs \nfrom 12 to 15, provide more standardized program components and protocols, incentivize youth \nleadership positions and provide internship opportunities to DCF youth alumni.  Request for \nProposals for the restructured YAB contracts were published on May 9, 2013 and the contract \nwas awarded on July 23, 2013 to Rutgers University Transitions for Youth Program.  DCF is \ncurrently in the process of transitioning to the new YAB structure.     \n \n \nA.  Services for LGBTQI Population \n \nThe MSA required DCF to develop and begin to implement a plan for appropriate services to be \ndelivered to youth who identify as LGBTQI (Section II.C.4).  During this monitoring period, \nDCF continued to implement strategies and services to meet the needs of this population.  The \nprimary vehicle for these services is through the Safe Space Program.  This program encourages \nand promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment within DCF for LGBTQI youth, families \nand staff through training, activities, resources, community partnerships, collection of LGBTQI \ndata and through developing policies that reflect appropriate case practice with this population.  \nDCF has increased the number of Safe Space liaisons during this monitoring period by adding an \nadditional 24 liaisons, now offering a total of 148 for all 47 DCP&P Local Offices.  DCF reports \nthat these liaisons provided more than 200 consultations concerning case practice and \ncommunity resources related to LGBTQI youth and families this monitoring period.  Liaisons \nrecently produced an updated resource guide, “TRIANGLE: Teen Resources Intended to Aid & \nNurture Gays, Lesbians & Everyone”144 and continued data collection and analyses, identifying \napproximately 200 LGBTQI youth and approximately 130 LGBTQI families that they serve. The \ndata are collected by OAS to identify, create and update policy, programming and practice needs \nto best support these youth and families.   \n \n \nB.  Performance Measures Measuring Services to Older Youth \n \nDuring March 2013, DCP&P served 3,026 youth aged 18 to 21; current information indicates \nthat 571 (19%) youth were living in a DCP&P out-of-home placement; 1,569 (52%) youth were \nliving in their own homes;145 and 886 (29%) youth were receiving adoption or Kinship Legal \nGuardianship subsidies. \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n144 The guide can be accessed at: http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/adolescent/lgbtqi/      \n145 DCF is currently further analyzing these data to better understand the exact setting(s) indicated for the youth \ncategorized as “living in their own homes.” \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

With the agreement of all \nparties, data for this measure will now be collected using a QR process.  A review of 20 older \nyouth cases, two from each area146 within the state, occurred in late July 2013 with the \nparticipation of staff from DCF, Plaintiffs and the Monitor.  Cases will be considered acceptable \nfor this Performance Measure if the QR ratings are acceptable for both the Child Status \nIndicators and Practice Performance Indicators.  Baseline performance will be determined using \ndata from the 20 cases reviewed in July 2013 as well as 24 additional older youth cases \npreviously reviewed by DCF between March 2012 and June 2013.  Data are currently being \nanalyzed and the findings will be presented in a report issued by DCF in collaboration with the \nMonitor in October 2013.

Areas needing improvement included documentation for the planning \nprocedures which may have been absent or insufficient and that planning procedures for \nsome of the youth should take a more holistic and comprehensive approach and account \nfor all of the youths’ difficulties and challenges.   \n \nEducation and Employment:  \n \n  70 percent of youth had undergone case planning specifically around their educational or \nvocational needs, however, only one-third were enrolled in educational or vocational \ntraining programs.   \n  Information pertaining to the Scholars program was conveyed to 29 percent of youth and \nonly four youth enrolled in higher education/vocational programs were enrolled in the \nScholars program.147   \n  51 percent of youth needed assistance and had undergone case planning specifically \naround their employment needs, however only 37 percent were employed full or part-\ntime at case closure.   \n  Reviewers identified that some youth had particular challenges in obtaining employment \ndue to cognitive limitations or criminal histories.   \n  Reviewers were asked to identify strengths and areas needing improvement with DCF’s \ncasework around education and employment.  Identified strengths included strong \nengagement activities with youth around their needs and that workers were resourceful in \nhow they supported the youth.  An area identified as a strength in some cases and an area \nneeding improvement in others was the level of the caseworker’s assessment.  Reviewers \nindicated that in some instances, a comprehensive assessment was used to focus on \nmultiple aspects of a youths’ functioning and in other cases, workers did not use a holistic \napproach and planning did not include consideration of the complexities of the youths’ \nexperiences and challenges.   \n \nPerformance on this measure was last assessed during a case record review of older youth exiting \ncare between January 1 and June 30, 2010.  This review found that 72 percent of youth had \nhousing and 60 percent of youth were employed or in some type of educational program.  DCF’s \ncurrent performance does not meet the level required by the MSA, however, when comparing \ncurrent data to performance two years ago, some improvements have been made in youth \n                                                 \n147 28 percent of youth reviewed were ineligible for the Scholars program due to not yet finishing high school.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Approximately one-third of the youth in this review did not possess a high school diploma or \nGED, which likely has implications for subsequent education and employment \nopportunities.  Thus, DCF should advance efforts to help youth acquire their high school \ndiplomas and link youth with employment readiness and training programs with a focus on \neducational stability and tutoring to assist children and youth to remain on grade level and \nsucceed.  Relationships should be developed or strengthened with local school districts and \nvocational/employment training providers to ensure youths’ access to these needed \nservices.  If DCF finds that additional service providers are needed in certain communities, \nstrategies should be developed to address this need. \n \n2.  Workers should continually assess barriers to educational enrollment and attainment and \nemployment security for each individual youth with whom they work, as each youth presents \nwith specific needs and circumstances and may require additional and unique supportive \nand/or accommodating services.  This practice should be reinforced through training and \ncoaching of workers to ensure that a holistic approach is used during assessment and \nplanning with youth. \n \n3.  DCF should update, strengthen and enforce policies regarding the completion of independent \nliving assessments and adolescent case closing agreements.  Focus should be given to \nassisting workers and providers in understanding the practical use and benefit of independent \nliving assessments as these tools are instrumental in developing appropriate case plans and \ntransition plans which should include services directed toward the specific needs of the \nindividual youth. \n \n4.  Of the youth’s records reviewed, close to one-third were living with relatives following their \nexits from care and had not achieved permanency prior to exiting care.  This raises questions \nabout whether DCF is proactively and continually planning for this specific population and if \nsuch relative resources were available as permanency options prior to exit from care.  DCF \nshould ensure through training and supportive coaching from supervisors and managers that \npermanency planning for youth in care is an ongoing process and should not cease once a \nyouth receives a non-permanency goal. \n \n5.  In order to track performance and collect data for this Performance Measure on a more \nfrequent basis, DCF will modify the adolescent case closing agreement and the Transitional \nPlan for Adolescents to include sections that will capture housing, employment and \neducation status at case closure.  In addition, upcoming reviews will include specific \ninquiries regarding the use of Family Team Meetings with these youth as these are a critical \ncomponent of the Case Practice Model and will assist with better understanding the case \nplanning process with a youth. \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

It would be beneficial if DCF explored more fully some of the incongruous findings noted in \nthis report.  For example, several youth had case goals that may have been at odds with the \nrealities of their actual case situations, such as Independent Living for 16-17 year olds even \nthough the youth were beyond 18 years of age.  Were the case goals the most appropriate \nones for these youth?  Did this have an impact on case planning or on any of their eventual \noutcomes? \n \nFurther, a significant obstacle youth typically face when exiting care is maintaining their health \ncare coverage.  Data regarding the number of youth receiving Medicaid health insurance148 upon \nexiting care has been provided by DCF.  In CY 2012, of the 460 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 who \nwere discharged from placement and needed Medicaid, 425 (92%) received Medicaid for at least \none month following discharge.  Additionally, of the 281 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 who were \ndischarged from placement between January 1 and September 30, 2012 and who needed \nMedicaid, 257 (91%) received Medicaid for at least six months.  This is an improvement from \nthe 80 percent performance on this measure for youth discharged from care between July 1 and \nDecember 31, 2011.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n148 This includes Chafee Medicaid, DCP&P Medicaid or non-DCP&P Medicaid.      \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUPPORTING A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE: CASELOADS AND \nTRAINING \n \nDCF continues to meet office average office caseload standards for Permanency and Intake \nworkers, and individual caseload standards for IAIU staff and Permanency workers.  DCF has \nnot met standards for office average caseload for Adoption workers, and individual caseload \nstandards for Adoption and Intake workers, although Intake caseload performance has improved \nduring this monitoring period.   \n \nA.  Caseloads \n \nCaseload compliance is measured by individual caseworker caseloads in each of the functional \nareas (Intake, Permanency, Adoption and IAIU) as well as office standards for DCP&P Local \nOffices. Office-wide average caseloads are to comply with the applicable functional area \ncaseload standards in 95 percent of all DCP&P Local Offices and at least 95 percent of workers \nin each of the functional areas are to have individual caseloads meeting the designated standard \n(MSA Section III.B.1).

One-hundred sixty caseworkers were selected \nfrom those active in March 2013.  Forty-five of the 47 DCP&P Local Offices were represented \nin the sample.  The interviews were conducted throughout the months of April and May 2013.  \nAll 160 caseworkers were called.  Information was collected from 111 caseworkers (72% of the \neligible sample), located in 39 Local Offices.  Five caseworkers were no longer employed by \nDCP&P or were on extended leave during the period of the calls and were removed from the \nsample.  Contact was attempted at least three times for each caseworker that was not \ninterviewed.   \n \nDuring the interviews, caseworkers were asked if their caseloads met with caseload standards \nbetween July 2012 and March 2013 and their responses were compared to the caseload \ninformation the state supplied for the same period from NJ SPIRIT.  Workers were also asked to \nreport their specific caseload size for the month of March 2013.  The Monitor is satisfied that \nsufficient information was gathered to verify the accuracy of the state’s caseload reporting and \nthat, in general, NJ SPIRIT accurately reflects worker caseloads.  \n \nThe following discussion describes the state’s performance in meeting the office caseload \nstandards and the individual caseload standards.   \n \nDCP&P met the standard for average office caseloads for two of three functional areas, \nfailing to meet the standard for Adoption workers.   \n \nFigures 53-55 summarize the Period XIII performance on meeting Local Offices average \ncaseload standards.  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The state reported an average of 933 active Intake caseworkers between July 2012 and \nMarch 2013.  Among those active workers during this monitoring period, an average of 806 \n(86%) caseworkers had caseloads that met the caseload requirements.  Specifically in March \n2013, individual worker caseload compliance for Intake workers was 89 percent. For the 102 \nIntake workers who did not meet caseload requirements in March 2013, the highest number of \nnew intakes during the month for any worker was 12 and the highest number of open cases for \nany worker in the month was 35 families.   \n \nData by Local Office show that during March 2013, performance ranged between 29 percent and \n100 percent, with 22 of 46 (48%) Local Offices having all Intake workers with caseloads in \ncompliance (see Appendix C-1). \n \nAmong the 111 caseworkers who participated in the phone interview for caseload verification, \n73 were Intake caseworkers.150  Eleven (15%) of the 73 Intake workers recalled going over the \n                                                 \n149 This does not include IAIU staff and caseload standards. \n150 CSSP over-sampled Intake workers in the telephone survey because of expressed concerns with Intake caseloads. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Twenty-\nseven (37%) caseworkers reported having more than 12 total families on their caseload at some \npoint between July 2012 and March 2013.  DCF has been attempting to improve Intake caseload \ncompliance by hiring additional Intake workers to create “impact teams”151 deployed throughout \nthe state in offices where Intakes are unusually high.  Six of the 73 (8%) Intake workers \ninterviewed reported a positive effect from the implementation of the impact teams.  The \nimplementation of the impact teams appears to have stabilized Intake caseloads over the past \nyear but the state has not yet reached compliance levels.  \n \n \nFigure 56:  Percentage of Intake Caseworkers with Individual Caseloads \nat or Below the Applicable Individual Caseload Standards \n (June 2009 – March 2013) \n \n100%\nh  Final Target (95%)* \nwit\ns  90%\ner 91%\nworkads 80% 87% 84% 86%\naseselo 78%\nntake Cdual Ca 70% 76% 76% 76%\nof Idivi 60%\ne n\ngI\na\nnt\ne 50%\nc\ner JuJnuen--0099    D   eDceemc-b0e9r -  0  9     JJuunn-e1-01 0      D   e Dceemc-b1e0r - 1  0     JJuunn-e1-11 1      D   eDceemc-b1e1r  - 1  1   JuJnu-n1e2- 1  2     MDeacr-e1m3ber-1\nP\nMonth\nSource:  DCF data \n*The performance percentage shown on the last month of each monitoring period (June and December) is the \naverage of the prior six month’s performance in meeting individual caseload standards during that six month \nmonitoring period. The performance percentage shown for March 2013 is the average of the prior nine \nmonth’s performance in meeting individual caseload standards during that time. \n \n \nWorkers Report “Shared” Cases as a Common Occurrence \n \nAs described in the previous monitoring report for Period XII, Intake and Permanency \ncaseworkers sometimes share responsibility for cases (families).  According to DCF procedure, \nall CPS-Family reports are assigned to Intake workers to investigate and these reports are \nreflected in caseload reporting as new assignments in the month of the report and as one of their \n“open cases” for that month. When circumstances indicate that a permanency case needs to be \nopened before the investigation is complete or a family with an open permanency case is the \nsubject of a CPS-Family report, the work with the family becomes the shared responsibility of \nboth Intake and Permanency workers until the investigation is completed.   \n                                                 \n151 Impact teams are staff that can be assigned as a unit or individually to those offices that need additional \nassistance or have seen an exaggerated workload in a given period of time.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF believes this arrangement emphasizes the \nprimary role of the Permanency worker. It also reflects the Permanency worker’s responsibility \nto provide information to the Intake worker and to link the family to appropriate services and \nsupports identified during the course of the new investigation, thus relieving the Intake worker of \nsome, but not all, responsibility with the case.  Intake workers are still responsible for the work \nrequired to complete investigative tasks and reach an investigative conclusion.  The secondary \ndesignation, is not reflected in the caseload data and is not categorized as an open case for Intake \nworkers in SafeMeasures or in NJ SPIRIT reports provided to the Monitor, although it is \nreflected as one of the Intake workers eight new referrals.  \n \nDCF reports that Intake supervisors in DCP&P Local Offices are expected to appropriately \nmanage the workload of their units and consider an Intake worker’s primary and secondary \nresponsibilities when assigning new referrals.  The following table provides the reported number \nof secondary Intake worker assignments by month during this monitoring period.   \n \nTable 28:  Number of DCF/DCP&P Investigations and Secondary Intake \nAssignments by Month \n(July 2012 – March 2013) \n  \nSecondary Intake Worker \n2012-2103  Total Investigations \nInvestigations* \nJuly 2012  4,926  1,119 \nAugust 2012  5,021  1,069 \nSeptember 2012  5,160  1,074 \nOctober 2012  5,728  1,255 \nNovember 2012  5,220  1,141 \nDecember 2012  5,043  1,078 \nJanuary 2013  6,069  1,325 \nFebruary 2013  5,542  1,153 \nMarch 2013  5,770  1,194 \nSource:  DCF NJ SPIRIT Data  \n*Only includes assignment types of CA/N Investigation and CWS Assessment. \n \n \nThe Monitor asked questions during phone interviews with workers to follow-up on the topic of \nshared or secondary cases.  Intake workers were asked how prevalent secondary cases are, what \neffect these cases have on their workload and how they are measured.  Of the 73 Intake workers \ninterviewed, 70 (96%) reported being assigned as a secondary worker on at least one open \nPermanency case between July 2012 and March 2013.  Sixty-three of the 70 (90%) Intake \nworkers confirmed that their supervisor counts secondary assignments toward their eight \nassignments for the month.  Forty-two of the 70 (60%) Intake workers interviewed responded \nthat the workload for an investigation on an open Permanency case designated as secondary is \nequivalent or sometimes more than an initial investigation.  Workers explained that although \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Fifty of the 70 (71%) \nIntake workers reported receiving at least one secondary assignment a month.  The Monitor \ncontinues to track the incidence of shared cases as it is clear that shared cases have an impact on \nthe true workload of Intake workers.  The number and impact of these shared cases becomes \nparticularly important for those Local Offices not in compliance with Intake caseload standards \nbased on primary assignments. \n \nWorkers Report Non-Caseload Carrying Staff Assigned Intake Cases \n \nAs part of the interviews discussed above, Intake workers were asked if there were scenarios in \ntheir office in which non-caseload carrying staff could be assigned an investigation. Twenty-\nseven of the 73 workers (37%) reported that there are scenarios in which this takes place.  \nRespondents stated that non-caseload carrying staff with prior investigations experience can be \nassigned cases when all Intake workers in a Local Office reach their assignment limit for the \nmonth.  This was the most common scenario described.  The most frequently identified job titles \nfor the non-caseload carrying staff who are assigned investigations are Litigation Specialists and \nResource Development Specialists. Seventy-four percent of Intake workers interviewed with \nspecific knowledge about the topic reported that the non-caseload carrying staff assigned \ninvestigations in their office had completed First Responder/Intake training. The remaining 26 \npercent of Intake workers interviewed did not know if the non-caseload carrying staff completed \nFirst Responder/Intake training. DCF agrees that the practice of assigning investigations to \nuntrained workers should never be permissible.  \n \nInstitutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) \n \nAs of March 31, 2013 the individual worker caseload standard for IAIU investigators of no more \nthan 12 open cases at any one time and no more than eight new referrals assigned in a month was \nmet: DCF data show 97 percent compliance with the standard for IAIU caseloads.  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

For children under 18, the child’s legal guardian is asked to give informed \nconsent for participation in the QR.  Trained review teams of two persons that include DCF staff, \ncommunity stakeholders and Monitor staff review DCP&P case records and interview as many \npeople as possible who are involved with the child and family.  Following the QR in each \ncounty, areas of accomplishment and challenges for the system are identified and discussed to \ninform continued case practice improvement. Selected QR results are also used to report on \nseveral MSA requirements and are included in this report.  \n \nOf the 107 children whose cases were reviewed between July 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, 53 \nwere male and 54 were female. They ranged in age from less than one year old to 20 years old, \nwith the majority (36%) being infants to four year olds.  An equal number of the 107 children \nreviewed were five to nine years old (23%) and over age fourteen (23%).  Eighteen percent of \nthe children were between ten and 13 years old.  The majority (44%) of the children in the \nsample were identified as White/Caucasian and 33 percent identified as Black/African-\nAmerican.  Hispanic/Latino children represented 20 percent of the children in the sample and the \nremaining children were identified as Asian (1%).  Children whose race was not determined \nrepresented two percent of the sample.  Almost a third (31%) of the children were living with a \nparent at the time of the review; 69 percent of the children lived with a relative or non-relative \nresource parent, some with the goal of adoption.  \n \nDCF reports that across the state, 990 people were interviewed to inform the QR data for this \nreporting period.  Those informants included DCP&P and Child Health Unit staff, biological \nparents, others who the youth or parent identified as supportive, relative and non-relative foster \nparents, education providers, mental health and legal professionals, substance abuse treatment \nproviders, and children/youth.160  Reviewers evaluated the child and family’s status and rated \nwhether the status was acceptable or unacceptable.161  See Table 31 for the results on each Child \nand Family Status indicators and overall Child Status ratings for all cases. \n \nAs shown in Table 31, the current status of children was rated at least minimally acceptable in \nthe majority of cases in most key areas measured including safety, living arrangement, learning \nand development and physical health of the child.

All efforts are made to see \nchildren/youth in the setting in which they reside. \n161 Under the heading of acceptable, status is further described as either “optimal,” “good,” or “fair.” Unacceptable \nstatus is further described as either “marginal,” “poor,” or “worsening.” \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Following the QR and \nbased on results, each county develops a plan to focus on improving practice in particular areas. \nThe statewide QR process has become a routine part of quality improvement practice in New \nJersey and QR data are regularly used to inform policy and practice changes. \n \nDCF released an annual report on findings from 2012 QRs in July 2013 and it is available at \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/divisions/opma/2012_QRAnnualReport.pdf.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SafeMeasures \nallows the staff to analyze data by area office, county, Local Office, unit supervisor and by case \nand provides the staff with quantitative data they can use to identify strengths and diagnose \nneeds in case practice to improve outcomes. \n \nDCF continues to work to improve data entry, data quality and data reporting through NJ \nSPIRIT.  Additionally, DCF continues to fulfill the MSA requirement to produce agency \nperformance reports with a set of measures approved by the Monitor and to post these reports on \nthe DCF website for public viewing (MSA II.J.6).163 \n \nNJ SPIRIT functionality was again enhanced during this monitoring period. The new multi- \nselection for contact activity notes allows users to document multiple contact activity note types \non a single note within NJ SPIRIT. As a result, documentation has been simplified and \nduplicative data entry has been eliminated. DCF successfully implemented the training and roll \nout of all 430 iPad 2s to identified staff across the state in multiple offices and regions within this \nmonitoring period.  This allows workers to remotely enter data directly into NJ SPIRIT.  DCF \nhas received a subsequent workers Visitation Grant in FY 2012 and has purchased an additional \n330 iPad 2s. They were scheduled to be fully operational by April 2013.  \n \nDCF continues to work in collaboration with New Jersey Office of Information Technology \n(OIT) to develop a new reporting tool through the inclusion of NJ SPIRIT data in OIT’s \nElectronic Data Warehouse (EDW). When fully developed, DCF will be able to create reports \nthat cut across three divisions and potentially other state departments (i.e. health and education) \nin order to more effectively monitor child, youth and family outcomes. The state has completed \nPhase II “developing the Match Client process,” within the EDW environment during this \nmonitoring period, allowing for a secure data sourcing against data elements already within \nEDW. \n \nThe NJ SPIRIT Help Desk has continued to produce monthly newsletters to provide workers \nwith tips and to introduce new functionality.  The monthly newsletter is emailed to field staff and \nposted on the DCP&P intranet. DCP reports that the Help Desk published nine monthly \nnewsletters between the period of July 2012 and March 2013.   Between July 2012 and March \n2013, the Help Desk closed 17,599 tickets requesting help or NJ SPIRIT fixes. Help Desk \nresolved 9,955 (57%) of the 17,599 closed tickets within one work day and an additional 4,752 \n(27%) tickets within seven work days for a total of 84 percent resolved within seven work days.   \n \nThe state received approval of the federal AFCARS Improvement Plan (AIP) in January 2012, \nand began the process of correcting those general requirements and foster care/adoption data  \nelements identified in order for the state to meet full compliance with all federal requirements.  \nThe state continues to partner with the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) \n                                                 \n163 See http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/childdata/  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

According to DCF, numerous system enhancements were designed \nin response to specific AFCARS findings.  \n \nSafeMeasures \n \nDCF continues to refine reporting data using SafeMeasures and has seen a sustained increase in \nSafeMeasures usage by staff.  Data show an 11 percent increase in viewings of SafeMeasures \nscreens by DCF staff in 2012 as compared to 2011. DCF continues to develop a number of new \nreports in SafeMeasures to help staff better manage caseloads and worker responsibilities.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 BUDGET \n \nThe DCF budget for FY 2014, which began July 1, 2013 is slightly over a billion dollars ($1.05 \nbillion) in appropriated state funds. The approved budget represents a decrease of $13.8 million \nor 1.3% less than the adjusted FY 2013 appropriation.  DCF reports that the decrease in the state \nfund appropriation is offset by an anticipated increase in federal Medicaid revenue as a result of \nthe state’s approved Medicaid waiver.  Under the waiver, DCF is able to claim federal matching \nfunds for certain services provided for children and youth through DCF’s Children’s System of \nCare (CSOC), services that were previously funded entirely with state dollars.  \n \nDCF believes that the approved budget provides sufficient resources to carry out the state’s \ncommitment to meet all MSA requirements for staffing and service delivery and for the state’s \nresponsibility for child protection, services to support children in their own homes and in out-of-\nhome placement and to achieve safety, permanency and well-being outcomes for the children \nand families it serves.  \n \nWith respect to staffing, the FY 2014 budget provides funds for 6,643 staff positions which \nrepresents no change from FY 2013.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  October 2013 \nMonitoring Period XIII Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

PRINCIPLES OF THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EXIT PLAN \nIheJnterpretation_of_the provjsiQ11s oLthi_s_Agreement will be gyjded by the followiQ.g \nprinciples: \nA.  Children in out-of-home care should be protected from harm. \n1.  Foster care should be as temporary an arrangement as possible, with its \ngoal being to provide to children in out-of-home placements a safe, \nnurturing, and permanent home quickly. \n2.  If at all possible, children in out-of-home placements should be quickly \nand safely reunified with their biological families.  If this cannot be \naccomplished, children need to be placed with an adoptive family, or in \nthe permanent legal custody of an appropriate kinship family, in a timely \nfashion. \n3.  Families should be provided with the services they need to keep them \ntogether whenever possible.  Families should be provided with the \nservices they need to allow for safe and speedy reunification whenever \npossible. \n4.  In making determinations about plans and services, the child's interests \nare paramount. \n5.  Children in out-of-home placement should be in the least restrictive, most \nfamily-like setting appropriate for their needs. \n6.  Children in out-of-home placement should be placed in settings that \npromote the continuity of critical relationships: together with their \n2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 3 of 19 PageID: 7965\nsiblings; with capable relatives whenever possible; and in their own \ncommunities. \n7.  Children in out-of-home placement should have stable placements that \nmeet their needs, and should be protected from the harm caused by \nmultiple placement moves. \n8.  Children in out-of-home placement should have the services necessary to \naddress their medical and psychological needs, including those services \nneeded to address problems arising from the child's removal from his or \nher biological family. \n9.  Children in out-of-home placement must have timely decision-making \nabout where and with whom they will spend their childhood, and timely \nimplementation of whatever decisions have been made. \n10.  Children in out-of-home placement should be protected from abuse and \nneglect and, to this end, investigations of allegations of abuse and neglect \nin out-of-home placements should be timely, thorough and complete. \n11.  Adolescents in out-of-home placements should be provided with the skills, \nopportunities, housing and permanent connections with caring adults they \nneed to successfully make the transition to adulthood. \n12.  The State shall make every effort to ensure that all children shall receive \nequal and appropriate access to services without regard to race, religion, \nsexual identity or ethnic origin. \nB.  Decisions about children in out-of-home placement should be made with \nmeaningful participation of their families and of the youth themselves to the \nextent they are able to participate. \nC.  In order to protect children and support families, New Jersey's child welfare \nsystem should operate in partnership with the neighborhoods and communities \nfrom which children enter care. \nD.  New Jersey's child welfare system should be accountable to the public; to other \nstakeholders; and to communities throughout the State. \nE.  Services to children in care and their families should be provided with respect for \nand understanding of their culture.  No child or family should be denied a needed \nservice or placement because of race, ethnicity, or special language needs. \nF.  New Jersey's child welfare system should have the infrastructure, resources, and \npolicies needed to serve the best interests of the children in its care. \n3 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 4 of 19 PageID: 7966\nThe list of principles outlined above is not intended to be exhaustive.  Rather, the parties \nacknowledge that the shared goal of improving outcomes for children will require commitments \nto principles and outcome measures that are broader than the subject matter of this Action. \nII.  FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS \nThe Parties acknowledge that elements in this Section provide the foundation for a \nhealthy child welfare system.  At the Monitor's discretion, based on a concern that a \nfoundational element has not been sustained, the Monitor may request additional data.  If \nthe data demonstrate a persistent problem, in the Monitor's discretion, the State will \npropose and implement corrective action.  The elements in this category are enforceable \nif the Monitor determines that a foundational element has not been sustained. \nA.  DATA TRANSPARENCY \nDCF will continue to maintain a case management information and data \ncollection system that allows for the assessment, tracking, posting or web-based \npublishing, and utilization of key data indicators.  The data indicators, including \ndefinitions and methodology will be developed in consultation and agreement \nwith the.Monitot:...Eublished.data.w.illbe.made..available..on_worker_caseloads_by_ \nworker type and office.  DCF will ensure the accuracy of published data and will \nmaintain its definitions and methodology.  DCF will continue to collect and \npublish, at appropriate intervals determined in consultation with the Monitor, both \nprocess and outcome data related to the requirements of this Agreement. \nB.  CASE PRACTICE MODEL \nDCF will continue to implement and sustain a Case Practice Model that is \nreflective of the principles of this Agreement and DCF's values. The model is a \ncontinuous set of activities that emphasizes quality investigation and assessment, \nincluding safety and risk assessment and risk reassessment, and engagement with \nyouth and families; working with family teams; individualized planning and \nrelevant services; continuous review and adaptation; and safe and sustained \ntransition from DCF. \nC.  STATE CENTRAL REGISTRY OPERATIONS \nInvestigations of alleged child abuse and neglect shall be received by the field in a \ntimely manner and investigation commenced within the required response time as \nidentified at SCR but no later than 24 hours. \nD.

FLEXIBLE FUNDING \nDCF will continue to make flexible funds available for use by workers in crafting \nindividualized service plans for children, youth and families to meet the needs of \nchildren and families, to facilitate family preservation and reunification where \nappropriate, and to ensure that families are able to provide appropriate care for \nchildren and to avoid the disruption of otherwise stable and appropriate \nplacements. \nI.  RESOURCE FAMILY CARE SUPPORT RATES \nThe State will continue to adjust the resource family care support rates to \nmaintain them at the USDA estimates for the cost of raising a child for the \nfollowing State fiscal year. The State will continue to adjust the Independent \nLiving Stipend considering the USDA estimate rates for raising an adolescent, the \n5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 6 of 19 PageID: 7968\nHUD Fair Market Value for average rent in New Jersey, and IRS estimates for \nmonthly food and household expenses. \nJ.  PERMANENCY \nConsistent with the principles of this agreement, DCF will continue to strengthen \nand sustain appropriate permanency and adoption practices for the children and \nyouth it serves, recognizing that DCF's permanency work begins at intake and is \nencompassing of the elements of the Case Practice Model. \nK.  ADOPTION PRACTICE \nThe process of freeing a child for adoption and seeking and securing an adoptive \nplacement shall begin as soon as the child's permanency goal becomes adoption \nbut no later than as required by federal law.

TO BE MAINTAINED \nThis category will include all requirements within this Agreement for which the State has \nsatisfied the outcomes and specified targets in this Agreement during at least the previous \nsix-month period. Ifthe State's performance for a review period falls below the \ndesignated outcomes and standards in this Agreement, the Monitor has discretion to \nadvise the State, and the State will have the opportunity to propose corrective action. If \nthe State's performance for a subsequent review period remains below the designated \noutcomes and standards in this Agreement, the Monitor will have the discretion to \ndetermine if the decline in performance is temporary, insubstantial and/or caused by \nreasonably unforeseen circumstances or that the State's corrective actions are sufficient \nto remedy the decline or to re-designate the standard as an \"Outcome to be Achieved.\" \nIn reviewing the status of measures in the \"To Be Maintained\" category, the Monitor will \nfirst look to the data published by DCF.  For any measures for which public data are not \navailable and where necessary for verification, DCF will provide data to the Monitor so \nthat the Monitor can verify performance and continued compliance with the standards in \nthis Agreement for each review period. The Monitor shall have access to all information \nit deems necessary as provided in Section V. of this Agreement. \nIf either party objects to the Monitor's designation of a requirement into the \"To Be \nMaintained\" category, either party may trigger the dispute resolution process for re \ndesignation of measures as described in Section VI, the Dispute Resolution section \nconcerning re-designation of measures. \n6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 7 of 19 PageID: 7969\nA.

MONITORING \nA.  The parties agree that the Center for the Study of Social Policy, under the \ndirection of Judith Meltzer, shall be the Monitor of the State's compliance with \nthe goals and principles of this Agreement. \nB.  The Monitor's duties shall be to confirm independently the data reports and \nstatistics provided pursuant to this Agreement, including:  conduct independent \ncase record and other qualitative reviews; review all plans and documents agreed \nto be developed and produced by the State pursuant to this Agreement; and report \non the State's progress in implementing the terms of this Agreement and the \n12 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 13 of 19 PageID: 7975\nachievement of the improved outcomes set forth herein.  Among the Monitor's \nresponsibilities, the Monitor shall review whether case practice reflects the \ncomponents of the Case Practice Model referred to throughout this Agreement. \nC.  The Monitor shall prepare reports that will address these issues and be released \nperiodically, but no less than every six months, unless the parties and the Monitor \nagree otherwise.  To avoid duplication and to build capacity within the agency, \nthe Monitor will look first to the State's data and data analysis.  Accordingly, the \nState shall provide the Monitor with copies of all regular data reports respecting \nmeasures contained in this Agreement. The State also agrees to provide all data \nand reports requested by the Monitor, whether or not that data is already compiled \nfor use on the State's website or in any of its web-based or other publications, \nrespecting measures contained in this Agreement. \nD.  Respecting measures contained in this Agreement, notwithstanding the existence \nof State data, data analysis, and reports, the Monitor will have the authority to \nprepare new reports on outcome measures and all other enforceable measures \ncontained in this Agreement. \nE.  The-State-agrees to pro:v.ide-the-Monitor with-fr-ee-access to all individuals within \nDCF and its Divisions, any successor agencies or divisions, and persons within \nthe Executive Branch, as the Monitor chooses; to assist the Monitor in gaining \nfree access to other stakeholders in the child welfare system (including but not \nlimited to the staff of contract providers); and to provide the Monitor with free \naccess to all documents and data the Monitor deems relevant to its work \n(including but not limited to documents and data from contract agencies).  The \nMonitor agrees to respect the confidentiality of all information related to \nindividually identifiable clients of the Department and its Divisions, subject to \napplicable law.  The Monitor further agrees to respect the confidentiality of any \ndocuments that are in draft form or otherwise privileged, subject to applicable \nlaw. \nF.  The reports of the Monitor shall be public documents, except that any individually \nidentifiable information (as that term is understood under New Jersey law) and \nany other confidential information protected from disclosure by law, including \nwithout limitation any protected health information and/or individually \nidentifiable health information (as those terms are understood under HIPAA) shall \nbe redacted or otherwise removed from any public report.  The Monitor shall have \na sufficient, reasonable budget (the funding of which shall be the responsibility of \nthe State), staff, and access to information, including access to State employees, \nthat the Monitor deems necessary to fulfill his or her duties.  Any such \ninformation received by the Monitor, unless already public, will not be made \npublic without the State's prior written permission, except as incorporated into a \npublic report of the Monitor. \nG.  Plaintiffs shall have access, through the Monitor, to all information made \navailable to the Monitor, and to all information related to ensuring compliance \n13 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 14 of 19 PageID: 7976\nwith and enforcing this Agreement, subject to any confidentiality order(s) in \neffect in this case. \nH.  The parties' intent is that the Monitor, in collaboration with the State, will \ndevelop a plan to transfer the primary monitoring function to DCF's Office of \nPerformance Management and Accountability upon the termination of this \nAgreement, or at such earlier time as the parties may agree.  The Monitor will \nwork in collaboration with the State to build DCF's quality-assurance capacity \nand will reasonably ensure that monitoring is supportive ofDCF's good-faith \neffort and need to absorb primary monitoring within DCF. \nI.  The Monitor may periodically meet privately with the Court concerning issues \nrelated to this case, provided the parties are made aware of the occurrence of such \na meeting. \nJ.  If at any point the Monitor can no longer serve, the parties shall agree on another \nMonitor, with input and recommendations from the outgoing Monitor. \nVI.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \nA.  Dispute Resolution regarding Non-compliance \nIn the event that Plaintiffs believe that Defendants are not in substantial \ncompliance with an enforceable provision of this Agreement: \nI.  Plaintiffs shall notify Defendants and the Monitor in writing of the \ncompliance issue prior to seeking any judicial relief. \n2.  Within I 0 calendar days of such notification, the State may respond in \nwriting to Plaintiffs and the Monitor regarding the compliance issue raised \nand what actions, if any, it proposes to take with regard to the alleged \nissue of non-compliance. \n3.  Within 30 calendar days of the original notification, the parties shall meet \nwith the Monitor, unless extended by agreement of the parties and the \nMonitor.  The purpose of the meeting will be for the parties to engage in \ngood-faith negotiations with the assistance of the Monitor to determine \nwhat, if any, actions are necessary to address the issues raised in the \ndispute.  The parties shall engage in negotiations for a period not to exceed \n30 calendar days, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties and \nthe Monitor. \n4.  At the conclusion of the dispute resolution, if the parties have not come to \na resolution, the Monitor shall analyze the issues raised by Plaintiffs and \nthe State's response and shall prepare and issue a written report with \nrecommendations concerning the dispute.  The Monitor's report shall be \nissued no later than I5 calendar days after the conclusion of dispute \n14 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 15 of 19 PageID: 7977\nresolution.  The report shall be provided to the parties and the Court and \nshall be considered a public document. \n5.  If, at the conclusion of the dispute resolution process and following the \nreceipt ofthe Monitor's report, Plaintiffs determine that judicial action is \nnecessary, Plaintiffs may seek further relief from the Court. \n6.  If Plaintiffs believe that Defendants have violated this Agreement and the \nalleged violations have caused or are likely to cause immediate or \nirreparable harm to the well-being of children in the State's custody, they \nmake seek judicial relief following an expedited dispute resolution \nprocess.  Plaintiffs must provide Defendants and the Monitor with written \nnotice with respect to any such harm, including documentation that \nPlaintiffs believe supports their decision to invoke the provisions of this \nparagraph.  Defendants will respond to this notice, in writing, within 3 \nbusiness days.  The Parties and the Monitor will then engage in the \nmediation process outlined in sections 3 and 4 above, provided that the \nentire mediation process is completed within I 0 business days of \nDefendants' response to Plaintiffs' notice, unless extended by mutual \nagreement of the-parties and the-Monitor. \n7.  In an action in federal court to remedy an alleged failure to comply with \nany terms of this Agreement, Plaintiffs shall have the burden to \ndemonstrate that Defendants have failed to comply with the specific terms \nof the Agreement and that they are entitled to relief.  Factors that may be \nconsidered by the Court, but are not dispositive, are: \na.  Conclusions and findings in the independent monitoring reports; \nb.  Constraints, including legal constraints, upon Defendants' ability \nto comply; \nc.  The interests at stake; and \nd.  The progress that has been made towards achieving compliance \nwith the specific terms in dispute. \nB.  Dispute Resolution regarding Re-designation of Measures \nI.  Concurrent with the Monitor's Report for each reporting period, the \nMonitor shall inform the parties of any measures that they will \nrecommend to the Court be re-categorized as either an \"Outcome to be \nMaintained\" or an \"Outcome to be Achieved.\" \n2.  If either party objects to the Monitor's designation of a measure as being \ncategorized as either To Be Maintained or To Be Achieved, that party may \ninvoke the dispute resolution procedure described in this section. \n3.  Within I 0 calendar days of such notification, either party may provide \nwritten notification to the Monitor and to the other party that they disagree \n15 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 16 of 19 PageID: 7978\nwith a recommendation for categorization and provide their reasons for \nsuch disagreement. \n4.  Within 15 calendar days of the Monitor's receipt of written notification of \nobjection from either party, the Monitor will engage in discussions with \nboth parties to understand the nature of any objections and the evidence \nfor accepting/disputing the Monitor's recommendation. \n5.  Within 30 days of the Monitor's discussions with each party, the Monitor \nshall determine the category designation and provide both parties and the \nCourt with a written statement of its decision and the evidence that \nsupports it. \n6.  The Monitor's decision shall be final and binding on the parties. \n7.  Once a requirement has been included in the \"Outcome to Be Maintained\" \ncategory, it will remain in that category for the duration of court \njurisdiction of this matter, unless the Monitor determines that the State's \nperformance during the immediately preceding six-month period has \nfallen below the desi_goated outcomes and standards in this Agreement.  In \nmaking this determination, the Monitor shall have the discretion to \ndetermine whether the decline in performance is insubstantial, temporary \nand/or caused by reasonably unforeseen circumstances; or that the State's \ncorrective action(s) are sufficient to remedy the decline; or to re-designate \nthe measure as an \"Outcome to Be Achieved.\" \n8.  If the performance fails to meet the performance standard for a subsequent \nperiod, the Monitor shall determine whether to re-designate the \nperformance measure as an \"Outcome to Be Achieved.\" In making this \ndetermination, the Monitor shall have the discretion to determine whether \nthe decline is insubstantial or caused by reasonably unforeseen \ncircumstances and/or whether there is evidence that the State's actions to \nremedy the decline demonstrate sound implementation of sufficient \ncorrective action(s), CQI efforts to examine the effectiveness of the \ncorrective action and progress toward meeting the designated performance \nmeasure. \nVII.  TERMINATION AND EXIT \nA.  Defendants may seek a ruling from  the Court terminating the Court's \njurisdiction over this Agreement based on Defendants demonstrating that \nthey have achieved compliance with this Agreement for a continuous period of at \nleast 12 months.  A determination by the Monitor that all provisions are in the \"To \nBe Maintained\" category and have remained in that category for at least 12 \nmonths is prima facie evidence that this standard has been met. \nB.  Defendants may not, however, seek such a ruling if there are any pending \nmotions  before the Court, if there are then in effect any orders based on \n16 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 17 of 19 PageID: 7979\nnoncompliance with any enforceable provisions of this Agreement, or there \nare any notices  of non-compliance or action plans still in effect pursuant to \nthe dispute resolution section of this Agreement.  If, in response to such an \napplication by Defendants, Plaintiffs can show that Defendants have failed  to \nsatisfy their burden  outlined above, the Court shall  retain jurisdiction. If \nPlaintiffs can show continued Court jurisdiction is necessary to accomplish \nthe purposes of this Agreement the Court may also retain jurisdiction. \nC.  During the first six months following the Court's entry of an order terminating the \nCourt's jurisdiction over this Agreement pursuant to section VILA, the State shall \ncontinue to publish accountability data and make additional data available to the \nMonitor if the Monitor requests it to validate continued performance. Ifthere is a \nserious, systemic decrease in Defendants' performance that is not temporary or \ninsubstantial, Plaintiffs have the right to file a motion seeking to vacate the order \nand restore Court jurisdiction based on that change in performance. \nD.  Neither party may argue that any change in the exit standard from the Settlement \nAgreement of September 2, 2003, or the Modified Settlement Agreement of July \n18, 2006, is intended to reflect agreement that there has been a substantive change \nto the-legal standard applicable-to the-termination or modification-o£.this--------- \nagreement when the Settlement Agreement was first executed. \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF AND INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND HEREBY, the \nparties, by and through their duly authorized representatives, execute this Agreement, intending \nthat it will become effective upon its approval and entry by the Court as provided herein. \nDATED: \nAllison Blake, Commissioner for Defendants  Marcia Robinson Lowry, for Plaintiffs \n/Vov~e/ \nDATED:  ~,=20~1=5 _________  \n17 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-03678-SRC-CLW   Document 340   Filed 11/04/15   Page 18 of 19 PageID: 7980\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nI.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nThe Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed in July 2006 by the Honorable \nStanley R. Chesler of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey as Federal \nMonitor of the class action lawsuit Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie. As Monitor, CSSP is \ncharged with independently assessing New Jersey’s compliance with the goals, principles and \noutcomes of the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) aimed at improving the state’s child \nwelfare system.1 \n \nAs reported in the previous monitoring period, the impact of Superstorm Sandy was far-reaching. \nThe aftereffects of the storm effected workers and their families, as well as resource families, \nchildren, youth and families involved with Department of Children and Family Services (DCF).  \nIn recognition of that, and the difficulties Superstorm Sandy created for the state and its ability to \nprovide services in the immediate aftermath of the storm, the parties to this lawsuit agreed and \nthe Court sanctioned extending the previous reporting period—which otherwise would have \ncovered July to December 2012—by three months to March 31, 2013. As a result, the previous \nreport includes nine months of performance data for the period July 1, 2012 to March 31, \n2013.  In order to resume a schedule of reporting based on six month periods, the parties agreed \nand the Court sanctioned that this report will include nine months of performance data for the \nperiod April to December 2013.  Hereafter, reporting will resume a schedule of six month \nincrements, and the next monitoring report will cover January to June 2014. The Monitor again \ncommends DCF for its exemplary work during and after Superstorm Sandy and recognizes the \nfact that New Jersey’s child welfare system responded and continued to operate smoothly \nthrough a natural disaster, which is indicative of its solid infrastructure and committed \nworkforce. \n \nThis is the 14th monitoring report under the MSA and the eighth report that includes Phase II \nrequirements of the MSA.2 \n \nMethodology \n \nThe primary source of information on New Jersey’s progress is data supplied by the Department \nof Children and Families (DCF) and verified by the Monitor.  DCF provides extensive aggregate \nand back-up data as well as access to staff at all levels to enable the Monitor to verify \nperformance.  For this report, the Monitor was involved in the following additional activities: \n \n  Caseload Data Verification \n \nThe Monitor conducted a telephone survey of 125 workers to verify their individual \ncaseloads during this monitoring period. Findings from this survey are discussed in \nSection XIII—Supporting a High Quality Workforce—of this report. \n   \n                                                 \n1 To see the full Agreement, go to http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/home/Modified_Settlement_Agreement_7_17_06.pdf. \n2 Copies of all previous Monitoring Reports can be found at www.cssp.org. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 1 \n\n \n  Housing, Employment and Education Status Review for Older Youth Exiting Care \n \nThe Monitor collaborated with DCF to review case records of 106 youth ages 18-21 years \nwho exited care between January and December 2013 without achieving permanency. \nThe review, which took place in two parts—December 2013 and February 2014—\nprimarily focused on the education, housing and employment status of these youth and \nthe transition planning activities undertaken by DCF. Findings and recommendations \nfrom the review are discussed in Section XII—Services to Older Youth—of this report.   \n \n  Shelter Placement Data Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed 17 out of 44 cases from April through December 2013 in which \nyouth age 13 and older were placed in shelters for more than 30 days pursuant to court \norder to examine whether the exceptions to the 30 day limit, which permits shelter \nplacement to extend beyond 30 days pursuant to a court order, were appropriately \napplied. (See Section VI – The Placement of Children in Out-of-Home Care). \n \n  Visitation Data Review \n \nThe Monitor reviewed 50 out of 507 case records from September 2013 of families with \nchildren newly in placement to verify that the children had the requisite two visits from \ntheir caseworker during the first two months of the initial or subsequent out-of-home \nplacement.  Findings from this validation review are discussed in Section V—\nImplementing the Case Practice Model—of this report.   \n \n  Other Monitoring Activities \n \nThe Monitor interviewed and/or visited multiple external stakeholders of New Jersey’s \nchild welfare system, including contracted service providers, youth, relatives, birth \nparents, advocacy organizations and judicial officers. The Monitor also periodically \nattends DCF’s ChildStat meetings, statewide Child Fatality/Near Fatality Review Board \nmeetings, adolescent practice forums, Area Director meetings, Health Care Case \nReviews, youth permanency meetings, youth advisory board meetings and participates in \nstatewide Qualitative Reviews. DCF has fully cooperated with the Monitor in notifying \nthem and facilitating their participation in relevant activities.  \n \nStructure of the Report \n \nSection II of the report provides an overview of the state’s accomplishments and challenges. \nSection III provides summary performance data on each of the outcomes and performance \nmeasures required by the MSA in Table 1, Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie Child and Family \nOutcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Summary of Performance as of December \n31, 2013).  \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 2 \n\n \nThe remaining sections of the report provide more detailed data and discussion of performance in \nthe following areas:  \n \n  New Jersey child protective services units which receive reports and investigate \nallegations of alleged child maltreatment (Section IV); \n  Implementation of DCF’s Case Practice Model (Section V); \n  Placement of children in out-of-home settings, incidence of maltreatment of children in \nfoster care, and abuse and neglect of children when they reunite with families (Sections \nVI and VII); \n  New Jersey’s efforts to achieve permanency for children either through reunification with \nfamily, legal guardianship or adoption (Section VIII); \n  Provision of health care and mental health services to children and families (Sections IX \nand X); \n  Services provided to children, youth and families involved with DCF and to prevent child \nwelfare system involvement (Section XI); \n  Services to older youth (Section XII);  \n  Staff caseloads and workforce training (Section XIII); and \n  Accountability through the Qualitative Review and the production and use of accurate \ndata (Section XIV). \n \nIn order to better understand the progress DCF has made since the start of the reform, the report \nincludes, where appropriate, trend data from the first available data, usually June 2009 through \nDecember 2013.3 In addition, Appendices B-1 through B-6 provide data by Local Office on \nselected key case practice measures.  \n   \n                                                 \n3 For some Performance Measures, December 2013 data are not available. For those areas, the most recent data are \ncited with applicable timeframes. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 3 \n\n \nII.  SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE \n \nThe progress documented in this report covering April through December 2013 represents a \nstatewide effort to improve outcomes for children and families involved with New Jersey’s \nDepartment of Children and Families (DCF), and reflects the committed work of staff and \nadministrators, as well as their partners in private agencies, the courts, resource parents and other \nservice providers.   \n \nDCF continues to make significant progress toward meeting the requirements of the Charlie and \nNadine H. v. Christie Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) including demonstrating improved \nimplementation of New Jersey’s Case Practice Model (CPM), specifically meeting standards on \ntimeliness of case planning and increasing performance on Family Team Meetings (FTMs), a \ncritical component of the CPM.  Further, as the report makes clear, the state has sustained \ncompliance on a number of MSA performance measures, sometimes for several years. DCF is \nalso demonstrating their increased capacity and efforts to effectively collect and use quantitative \nand qualitative data for management and practice improvements, an important and potentially \nenduring achievement.  \n \nIn January 2014, DCF appointed the former Director of Family and Community Partnerships \n(FCP) who led the statewide expansion of Family Success Centers and Early Childhood \nPrograms, including the Home Visitation Program and the Strengthening Families initiative, to \nbe the new Assistant Commissioner directly responsible for CP&P. Chosen for her extensive \nexpertise, including being the former Deputy Director of case practice at DYFS, she is expected \nto increase the focus throughout the state on the consistency of quality case practice. \nAdditionally, in February 2014 the former Area Director of Camden County was appointed the \nnew DCF Director of Family and Community Partnerships. DCF also made leadership changes \nin some Area Offices during this monitoring period, many involving supervisors and managers \nDCF has been training and cultivating to move into leadership positions. \n \nOther noteworthy accomplishments include: \n \n  The commencement of child protective services investigations within one hour of the \nhotline call’s completion for 97 percent of referrals; \n  Consistent, solid performance on nearly all the MSA health care measures, indicating that \nchildren in out-of-home placement have dependable access to health care; \n  Routine recruitment and licensing of kinship homes with the result that more children in \nplacement are living with kin; \n  Good Qualitative Review (QR) ratings on how children’s out-of-home placement meets \ntheir developmental, emotional, behavioral and physical needs; \n  Ongoing work to consistently implement the CPM by improving and deepening the \nquality of workers’ case planning skills.  New training models are in use to assist \nsupervisors on site as they pursue practice improvement strategies; \n  Expansion of DCF’s policies and practices to support adolescents, including older youth \ntransitioning out of care; and \n  An approved Needs Assessment plan, developed after consultation with the Monitor and \nPlaintiffs, which involves a multi-year process to identify the strengths and address the \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 4 \n\n \nneeds of children and youth in out-of-home placement and children at risk of entering \ncare.  By the end of CY 2014 DCF will have completed its first interim report on the \nnorthern region of the state, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex \nand Union counties. (See Appendix C). \n \nDuring the monitoring period DCF continued to make progress toward meeting the Performance \nMeasures in the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA). As of December 31, 2013, 23 of the \nMSA’s 53 Performance Measures4 have been met and seven were partially met.5 There are \nadditional measures that were not met but where performance improved during the monitoring \nperiod.  \n \nThree Performance Measures were newly met during this monitoring period: \n \n  Timeliness of Response to Investigations (Performance Measure 3) \n  Timeliness of Initial Case Plans (Performance Measure 10) \n  Timeliness of Current Case Plans (Performance Measure 11) \n \nFour measures substantially improved during this monitoring period but are not yet at \ncompliance levels:   \n \n  Holding initial and quarterly Family Team Meetings (Performance Measure 7a and \n7b and Family Teamwork 7)6 \n  Visitation between children in custody and siblings placed apart (Performance \nMeasure 21)  \n  Risk Re-assessment Prior to Case Closure (Performance Measure 8c) \n  Youth Exiting Care (Performance Measure 55) \n \nThe report also includes findings on the Child and Family Status portion of the Qualitative \nReview conducted in the monitoring period indicating that the overall status of children and \n                                                 \n4 Monitoring reports prior to Period XIII referenced 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures.  \n5 “Partially” is used when DCF has come very close but has not substantially met the requirement, for example \nmeeting the requirement in the final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has \ntwo or more sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all. See \nfootnote 10 for a more detailed explanation of terms used in this report regarding compliance levels. Performance is \nbased upon the most recent available data through December 31, 2013. \n6 During the previous monitoring period and continuing from April through December 2013, DCF was engaged in \nan effort to better capture legitimate reasons for why FTMs do not occur, either because the parent is unavailable or \nbecause the parent declined to attend. The parties agreed that, consistent with the previous monitoring period, while \nthe state was involved in this self-diagnosis, the Monitor would continue to assess performance on FTMs by \ncounting only those FTMs that actually occurred. After the conclusion of the monitoring period DCF provided the \nMonitor with additional data indicating that after successfully clarifying and implementing policy, it had confidence \nthat staff were properly using and documenting exceptions. Given the timing, the Monitor has not yet been able to \ntake steps necessary to validate this data. The Monitor and DCF will conduct a statistically valid case record review \nto validate the new data and issue a supplemental letter on this measure prior to the next full monitoring report.   \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 5 \n\n \nfamilies rated acceptable in 90 percent of cases reviewed, including a rating of 98 percent for \nsafety in the home and 97 percent for physical health of the child reviewed. (See Section XIV). \n \nThe report also identifies challenges, most notably within the following adoption measures:  \n \n  The percentage of children who exit foster care to adoption within 30 months from \nremoval;  \n  The placement of children in an adoptive home when there is not an identified home at \nthe time of termination of parental rights; and  \n  The timely completion of child specific recruitment plans when necessary for children \nwith a permanency goal of adoption.   \n \nOther areas identified as challenges are:  \n \n  Stability measures for children in placement; \n  The quality of FTMs, case planning and case practice, including providing services to \nsupport transitions out of placement; and \n  Increased rates of repeat maltreatment of children within one year of reunification.  \n \nThe remainder of this summary discusses the strengths and challenges of current performance in \nthe major substantive areas covered by the MSA.  The data on specific Performance Measures \nare provided in Table 1 and the remainder of the report.  \n \nInvestigative Practice  \n \nDCF continues to have a strong investigative practice.  The State Central Registry (SCR) \noperates professionally, efficiently and effectively; reports of alleged abuse and neglect continue \nto be appropriately screened and timely forwarded to the field for investigation.  Investigative \nstaff are well trained.  New developments at SCR include an update of the call management \nsystem to allow screeners and supervisors access to calls at their desktop via email, facilitating \nreview of calls and timely supervision.   \n \nInvestigation caseloads, while improved over the previous two consecutive monitoring periods, \nremain higher than acceptable.  High intake caseloads may be affecting other areas of practice, \nparticularly the timely completion of investigations, which decreased in performance by nine \npercent this monitoring period.  The Monitor has not reassessed the quality of investigative \npractice this period but anticipates conducting a joint review with DCF of the quality of \ninvestigative practice and decision-making during the next monitoring period.  \n \nImplementation of the Case Practice Model  \n \nDuring this monitoring period, DCF continued to implement a number of approaches to improve \ncase practice performance that appear to have been effective for the following Performance \nMeasures: the timely completion of initial and current case plans; completion of risk re-\nassessments; and holding initial and quarterly Family Team Meetings (FTMs). One strategy is \nholding weekly conferences among DCF leadership, Area Directors and their Local Office \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 6 \n\n \nmanagers to review individual performance on specific key indicators, including visitation, \nFTMs and case plan development. Additionally, the CP&P Director continued to hold meetings \nwith Area Directors who were required to submit performance improvement plans for specific \nmeasures where performance was low. These approaches, having already demonstrated success, \nare projected to accelerate the pace of change and lead to additional positive outcomes as \nmeasured by the MSA and for children and families in New Jersey. \n \nThe Quality Review (QR) ratings for Practice and for System Performance, one indicator of the \nquality of case practice statewide, have improved overall and notably in a few important areas \nsuch as family engagement and effective use of FTMs. However, while improved, the QR ratings \nremain below levels expected by both DCF leadership and the MSA and underscore the need for \nDCF to continue its efforts to bolster the quality of supervision and its focus on the quality of \ntimely case plans and the case planning process.  Similarly, work remains to ensure that \ncaseworker visits with families happen consistently and to ensure that every visit is used as an \nopportunity to assess and effectively implement case plans that promote child safety, \npermanency and well-being.  \n \nDCF leadership throughout the state continue to demonstrate a solid commitment to transparent, \ninclusive practice improvement strategies.  The faithful implementation of the QR process is one \nexample.  DCF maximizes the utility of ChildStat meetings by holding them monthly with staff \nand stakeholders to identify strengths, areas needing improvement and the service delivery and \npolicy barriers that influence child and family outcomes.  DCF also continues to develop \nleadership skills among its staff through its New Jersey Fellows Program; from its inception in \n2012, as many as 178 staff, including supervisors and managers, have participated in the \nprogram. Designed specifically for staff to learn how to better use data to support improved case \npractice and outcomes for children and families, the project uses live lectures, data analysis skill \nbuilding, team projects, coaching, mentoring and conference presentations to enhance the \nleadership skills of DCF staff all across the state.   \n \nPlacement of Children in Out-of-Home Care \n \nDCF’s performance on MSA requirements regarding the appropriate placement of children in the \nstate’s custody remains strong overall.  Consistent with the previous monitoring period, 99 \npercent of cases examined through the QR were judged to be acceptable on the appropriateness \nof a child’s placement.  DCF has also continued to meet standards related to the placement of \nchildren in a family setting and within placement capacity limits. Further, as repeatedly reported, \nthere are now almost no children placed out of state for treatment and DCF meets all of the MSA \nrequirements regarding restrictions on the use of inappropriate placements such as congregate \ncare and shelter placement for young children and detention placements, an accomplishment met \nearly in the reform and sustained over time. The state has continued to appropriately recruit, \nlicense, train and retain resource parents; this monitoring period more than 50 percent of the \nnewly licensed families were relatives of children in care, a notable achievement.  Recruitment \nfor homes for large sibling groups and adolescents remains a DCF priority. \n \nWhile the state’s performance on the placement of sibling groups of four or more children \ntogether improved slightly, performance on placement of sibling groups of two or three together \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 7 \n\n \nfell  from 82 percent in CY 2012—exceeding the MSA standard of 80 percent—to 77 percent in \nCY 2013, a return to CY 2010 levels.  The state’s performance on the rate of stability for \nchildren in out-of-home care also declined: in CY 2011, 85 percent of children who entered care \nthat year and had two or fewer placements within the next 12 months; in CY 2012, the most \nrecent year for which data are available, performance declined to 82 percent: the MSA standard \nis that 88 percent of children will have two or fewer placements in the first 12 months of entering \ncare.  \n \nRepeat Maltreatment and Re-Entry into Foster Care \n \nThe MSA has several Performance Measures related to the repeat maltreatment of children who \nhave been served by CP&P through in-home services or in out-of-home placement.  The two \nperformance measures that remain to be met relate to repeat maltreatment of children within one \nyear of reunification and the percentage of children and youth who re-enter placement within one \nyear of leaving custody. \n  \nTimely Permanency through Reunification, Adoption or Legal Guardianship \n \nThe state’s performance on measures related to timely permanency through reunification, \nadoption or legal guardianship is based on calendar year data and the most recent data are \npresented in the report.  Overall, DCF’s performance in timely meeting permanency goals and \ndischarging children to permanency has improved slightly from the previous monitoring period \nbut does not meet the levels required by the MSA final targets. While performance on adoption \nmeasures is generally positive, despite new strategies for improvement, DCF’s current \nperformance on timely completion of child specific recruitment plans demonstrates a continued \ndecline as well as an increase in the percentage of child specific recruitment plans never \ncompleted.  There has also been a decline in performance for the small cohort of children \nwithout an identified adoptive home at the time of termination of parental rights and DCF \ncontinues to perform below the required MSA target on percentage of children who discharge \nfrom foster care to adoption within 30 months of their removal from home. On a positive note, \nperformance on finalizing adoptions within nine months of an adoptive placement remains \nstrong.   \n \nHealth and Mental Health Care for Children in Out-of-Home Placement \n \nSince June 2011, DCF has demonstrated consistently solid performance on nearly all MSA \nPerformance Measures related to health care services. As the Monitor has previously reported, \nDCF’s work through its Child Health Units and with its nurses and health and mental health \nproviders has meant that performance on the MSA’s health and mental health indicators remains \nstrong.  Further, results from the QRs on the provision of health care services were rated \nacceptable for 96 percent of the cases reviewed. \n \nServices to Prevent Entry into Foster Care and To Support Reunification and Permanency  \n \nAs part of the state’s strategies to support families to keep children safe at home, over the past \nfive years DCF has developed 51 Family Success Centers (FSCs), neighborhood based centers \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 8 \n\n \nwhere families can access services before falling into crisis.  Since Superstorm Sandy in October \n2012, these FSCs have become gateways to reach families in the counties that were hardest hit \nby the storm. In addition to providing families with assistance immediately following the storm, \nthe FSCs offer dependable support and a place to build and restore communities.  New Jersey’s \nfamilies have taken advantage of this resource as described in the report, and FSCs continue to \nbe a significant system strength.  Additionally, under the MSA, DCF continues to provide a \nrange of post-adoption supports to families and has been working to increase its capacity to \neffectively identify families affected by domestic violence and link them to appropriate services.  \nAn area for continued improvement remains the provision of services to families and youth to \nsupport successful transitions and life adjustments which was rated acceptable in just under half \nof the cases reviewed in recent QRs.  \n \nServices to Older Youth  \n \nDCF has put significant energy and resources towards improving the provisions of services and \nsupports to adolescents, including to those older youth transitioning out of care. The state’s \ncomprehensive review of its policies and programs has been one result of the focus on older \nyouth. The Office of Educational Support (OES) moved under the Office of Adolescent Services \n(OAS) on July 1, 2013.  This move has created opportunities for educating staff and resource \nparents about educational supports youth may need.  DCF has also developed new partnerships \nwith stakeholders that have led to expanded access to employment programs.  An important \nchange to policy pertaining to older youth that became effective April 1, 2013 is the updated \nIndependent Living stipend policy, increasing the amount of funding available to be more \ncomparable with current standards of living and to appropriately provide support for youth in \nindependent living placements or receiving independent living services.   \n \nThe state’s work with older youth continues to positively affect performance on MSA measures. \nIn December 2013, 96 percent of youth ages 14 to 18 completed Independent Living \nAssessments. A QR conducted between January 2012 and July 2013 of 44 cases of youth ages 18 \nto 21 found significant areas of strength, including the youth’s safety, living arrangement, \nphysical health and emotional well-being.  Challenges remain, however, around appropriately \nplanning with the youth for upcoming transitions and life changes. \n \nThe Monitor and DCF recently completed a case record review of 106 youth who exited care \nwithout achieving permanency between January and December 2013. Ninety-three percent of the \nyouth had a plan for housing upon exiting care; however, a third of applicable youth were neither \nemployed nor enrolled in education or vocational training programs at the time of their exit.  \n \nContinuous Quality Improvement \n \nDCF’s use of data to identify areas needing more attention, both in terms of areas of practice and \ngeographically, is demonstrating progress. DCF leaders consistently review performance \nindicators with Local Office management. New Jersey’s QRs also continue to provide county-\nlevel data on the state’s progress in implementing the Case Practice Model with quality, and \nDCF staff at all levels are becoming increasingly comfortable with using data to diagnose and \nassess barriers to quality case practice.  DCF’s ChildStat meetings and the DCF Fellows Program \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 9 \n\n \nare both innovative strategies that promote the increased use of quantitative and qualitative data \nto better understand and improve system performance and outcomes.  \n \nWhile there remain areas requiring further progress to meet MSA outcomes, the Monitor \nbelieves that DCF’s continued growth in its robust quality assurance and accountability \nprocesses will serve to enhance the quality of case practice and advance positive outcomes for \nNew Jersey’s children and families.   \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 10 \n\n \nIII.  CHILD AND FAMILY OUTCOME AND CASE PRACTICE PERFORMANCE \nMEASURES \n \nThe Child and Family Outcome and Case Practice Performance Measures (Performance \nMeasures) are 53 measures that assess the state’s performance on meeting the requirements of \nthe MSA (see Table 1).7  These Performance Measures cover the areas of child safety, \npermanency, service planning, child well-being and ongoing infrastructure requirements \npertaining to elements such as caseloads, training and resource family recruitment and retention.  \n \nMany of the measures are assessed using data from NJ SPIRIT (the CP&P data management \nsystem) and SafeMeasures,8 reviewed and in many areas independently validated by the Monitor. \nSome data are also provided through the Department’s work with Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc. \nthat assists with data analysis. Data provided in the report are as of December 2013, or the most \ncurrent data available. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 The previous monitoring report references 54 measures, however, performance for Measure 49 (Statewide \nImplementation of Differential Response, Pending Effectiveness of Pilot Sites) is not currently applicable as the DR \npilot concluded June 30, 2012, leaving 53 measures.  \n8 SafeMeasures is a data warehouse and analytical tool that allows tracking of critical child welfare indicators by \nworker, supervisor, Local Office area and statewide. It is used by different levels of staff to track, monitor and \nanalyze trends in case practice and targeted measures and outcomes.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

In other instances, the \nMonitor provides a range of data over the monitoring period to better illustrate performance.  More detailed information on DCF performance on specific measures is provided in \nsubsequent sections of the report. \n10 “Yes” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on presently available information, DCF has substantially fulfilled its obligations regarding the requirement under the \nMSA for the majority of the months during April 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 monitoring period. The Monitor has also designated “Yes” for a requirement where DCF is within \none percentage point of the final target or there are a small number (less than 3) of cases causing the failure to meet the final target. “Partially” is used when DCF has come very \nclose but has not substantially met the requirement, for example meeting the requirement in final one or two months of the monitoring period or in instances where a measure has \ntwo or more sub-parts and DCF has fulfilled the requirement toward one or more of the sub-parts, but not all.  “No” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, DCF has not fulfilled \nits obligation regarding the requirement.  \n11 Where applicable, “” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment based on data and an understanding of case practice, performance is trending upwards by at least three \npercentage points; “” indicates performance is trending downward by at least three percentage points; “↔” indicates that, in the Monitor’s judgment, there has been no change in \nperformance; “N/A” indicates a judgment regarding direction of change is not applicable to the measure during the monitoring period. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families                      July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

The parties agreed that, consistent with \nthe previous monitoring period, while the state was involved in this self-diagnosis and corrective action, the Monitor would continue to assess performance on FTMs by counting \nonly those FTMs that actually occurred. The report’s documented progress therefore includes the number of FTMs that have occurred.  Performance data for the monitoring period \nare as follows: April 2013, 49%; May 2013, 43%; June 2013, 46%; July 2013, 51%; August 2013, 47%; September 2013, 46%; October 2013 56%; November 2013, 63%; \nDecember 2013 69%. After the conclusion of the monitoring period DCF provided the Monitor with additional data indicating that after successfully clarifying and implementing \npolicy, it had confidence that staff were properly using and documenting exceptions. Given the timing, the Monitor has not yet been able to take steps necessary to validate this \ndata.

Screeners at SCR determine the nature of each caller’s concerns and initiate the \nappropriate response.  \n \nThis function also includes receiving calls about and investigating allegations of abuse and/or \nneglect in institutional settings (e.g., resource homes, schools and residential facilities).  \nCP&P Local Offices employ investigative staff to follow up on the calls as appropriate and a \nregionally organized Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) is responsible for \ninvestigations in institutional settings. \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Data from the call \nsystem show that in December 2013 callers waited approximately 15 seconds for an SCR \nscreener to answer their calls. Of all the calls received during this monitoring period, 44,271 \n(35%) calls75 related to the possible need for Child Protective Services (CPS) responses. Of \nthose, screeners classified 43,369 (98%) reports for investigation of alleged child abuse or \nneglect. Another 12,140 (10%) calls related to the possible need for Child Welfare Services \n(CWS) and assessment of service need, of which 11,672 (96%) were referred for response. \nFigure 1 shows a month-by-month breakdown of the call volume at SCR for April through \nDecember 2013.  \n \nFigure 1:  Number of Calls to SCR by Month \n(April–December 2013) \n \n20,000\n19,000\n18,000\n17,000\n16,373\n16,000\ns 15,671\nCall 15,000\nof  14,000 14,925\ner  14,230 14,201 13,950\nb 13,000\nm\nu 12,870\nN 12,000 12,375 12,568\n11,000\n10,000\nApr-13 May-13 Jun-13 Jul-13 Aug-13 Sep-13 Oct-13 Nov-13 Dec-13\nMonth\nSource:  DCF data \n                                                 \n75 Calls are differentiated from reports or referrals because SCR can receive several calls related to one incident or in \nsome cases one call can result in several separate reports.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Essential information gathered—identification of parents and other \nQualitative Measure  important family members \nc.  Decision making process based on information gathered and guided by \ntools and supervision \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nBetween April 2013 and December 2013, the SCR continued to make system improvements \nrelated to staff training and quality assurance which the Monitor believes has enhanced the \noverall quality of SCR response. SCR improved the internal training of newly hired staff by \nimplementing a new component to the training process that requires skilled SCR screeners to \ncomplete training status notes on trainee performance related to timeliness of response, \ninformation collection, documentation and decision making. This process assists with assessing \nthe newly hired staff’s areas of strength and improvements, enabling the training to be tailored to \nthe new hire’s individual skill level.  DCF employees who transfer to SCR76 continue to receive \nup to 20 days of training with an emphasis on live-call training. Newly hired SCR staff spend the \nfinal week of their training period on the designated shift they are assigned. This process permits \nthe supervisor to become an active participant in the screener’s training process.  \n \nIn June 2013, two SCR supervisors graduated from professional leadership programs: the DCF \nFellows Program and New Jersey Certified Public Manager’s (CPM) Program. These leadership \ntrainings are part of an ongoing effort to increase supervisors’ capacity to address complex \nsituations, measure results and assist in the implementation of sustained system change to better \nsupport screeners and improve outcomes for children and families. Additionally, in September \n2013 three SCR screeners were accepted into the DCF/Rutgers School of Social Work Violence \nAgainst Women Program. This program is part of DCF’s effort to increase screeners’ knowledge \nabout violence and its impact on children and families.  \n \nQuality assurance remains a priority for the SCR. As previously reported, a Quality Assurance \nPeer Review Team completes a daily review of all reports designated as information and referral \n(I&R)77 generated the previous business day. SCR staff evaluate 75 percent of all I&R calls \nreceived the previous business day to ensure they are properly categorized. Supervisory staff \nmore closely examine the remaining 25 percent of I&R calls for proper case practice. To account \nfor internal bias, reports identified with concerns are reviewed by casework supervisors who \nwere not included in the referral’s decision making process. The SCR administrator performs a \n                                                 \n76 All employees at SCR must have prior field experience. \n77 A call is identified as an I&R call when it has been determined that CP&P intervention is not warranted, and (1) a \ncaller is seeking a referral to one or more service providers, (2) a SCR screener determines that a referral is the \nappropriate response to the concern raised by the caller or (3) the matter is referred back to the caller for handling \n(e.g., police calling about non-abuse incident, school calling about educational neglect). \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 46 \n\n \n \ndaily review of randomly selected reports. SCR supervisors also review and evaluate a \nprescribed number of calls for their staff in order to continually assess their screeners' \nperformance, identify areas in need of improvement and provide on-going training to strengthen \nstaff skills. \n  \nDuring this monitoring period, work continued to update the call management system to allow \nscreeners access to their own calls at their desktop via email so they can listen to the call as many \ntimes as they need as they write their report and to facilitate supervision. This upgrade, \nscheduled to be completed as of October 2014, will allow for immediate evaluation of screeners’ \nwork by supervisors and will enable prompt supervisory feedback to screeners on their \nperformance. In June 2013, NJ SPIRIT was updated allowing SCR to attach screening calls to \nsummary intakes. In July 2013, SCR began attaching calls to CPS and CWS screening summary \nintakes allowing field staff the opportunity to hear first-hand what the caller reported. The \nMonitor anticipates that this will further enhance the overall quality of SCR practice.  \n \nB.  Timeliness and Quality of Investigative Practice \n \n3.

DCF met the final target for \ncommencing investigations within the required response time (Figure 3), for the first time this \nmonitoring period78.  \n \nCP&P policy on timeliness of investigations requires receipt by the field of a report within one \nhour of call completion.79  During the month of December 2013, DCF received 4,281 referrals of \nchild abuse and neglect requiring investigation. Of the 4,281 referrals, 3,941 (92%) referrals \nwere received by the field in less than an hour of call completion. An additional 323 (8%) \nreferrals were received by the field between one and three hours after call completion; for a total \nof 100 percent of referrals received by the field within three hours of call completion.  The \nnumber of referrals received per month ranged from 5,813 in May 2013 to 4,165 in August 2013.  \nThe number of referrals in May and October 2013 (which are typically months of high referral \nfor child protection agencies) were reported by DCF to be even higher than in the previous year. \nBetween 97 and 100 percent of referrals were received by the field within three hours of call \ncompletion during the months of April through December 2013. \n \nCP&P policy considers an investigation “commenced” when at least one of the alleged victim \nchildren has been seen by an investigator.  During the month of December 2013, there were \n                                                 \n78 The Monitor has determined that a requirement is met when DCF performance is within one percentage point of \nthe final target. \n79 The Monitor currently assesses performance of receipt by the field in a timely manner with a three hour standard.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Christie  Page 49 \n\n \n \npercent. Performance on this measure does not meet the final target and has declined by nine \npercent since March 2013.  \n \nAs reported in the prior monitoring period, a case record review of the quality of CP&P’s \ninvestigative practice was conducted in January 2013.81  This review examined the quality of \npractice of 324 CPS investigations assigned to DCF Local Offices between September 16 and \nSeptember 29, 2012 involving 688 children.82 \n \nOverall, the reviewers found that 253 (78%) of the investigations were of acceptable quality. The \nfindings of this review reflect some clear strengths in CP&P investigative case practice as well as \nareas in need of further development.  To improve the quality of investigative practice and \naddress recommendations from the review, CP&P has taken the following steps:  \n \n  Reviewing and Understanding a family’s prior child protection history: Through its \nuse of the statewide ChildStat, the Focus on Supervision83 initiative and supervisory \nconferences, DCF has continued to highlight the importance of understanding a family’s \nchild protection history when assessing a family’s overall functioning, prior interventions \nattempted and patterns of behaviors. During this monitoring period, CP&P changed NJ \nSPIRIT to  allow for more concise family history information to be included at the end of \nthe screening summary document, making it easily accessible to staff. This change is \nexpected to go into effect in July 2014.  \n  \n  Integrating collateral information into investigative decision making: CP&P issued a \nmemo to all staff clarifying the policy for contacting collaterals84. The policy is also \ndiscussed with all staff during supervisory conferences. DCF has expressed concern that \nthe Allegation Based System85 may be guiding practice too narrowly in determining \nwhich collaterals are most appropriate for which kind of allegations, and that as a result, \nstaff are not appropriately assessing the family. To improve on the process of gathering \ninformation from collaterals, in December 2013, CP&P initiated a work group that was \ntasked with reviewing the Allegation Based System and determining what changes need \nto be made.  \n \n  Timeliness of investigation completion: During the previous monitoring period, CP&P \ninstituted weekly key performance indicators phone calls with Area Directors, Local \nOffice managers, and casework supervisors facilitated by a staff from the Office of \nPerformance Management and Accountability. During these calls, technical assistance \nand support is provided to directly address barriers to the timeliness of investigation \ncompletion. Additionally, CP&P leadership has continued to encourage staff to complete \n                                                 \n81 A full report on the findings and recommendations from the review can be found at:  \nhttp://www.state.nj.us/dcf/about/divisions/opma/docs/NJ%20DCF%20Investigations%20Review%20Report.pdf \n82 These results have a ± 5% margin of error with 95% confidence.  \n83 Focus on Supervision is a case conferencing model that utilizes DCF contracted provider agency clinicians to co-\nfacilitate case conferences with CP&P casework supervisors.   \n84 Collaterals are defined as individuals having pertinent information regarding the family. \n85 In an Allegation Based System, policy directs specific activities based on the identified allegation(s) of \nmaltreatment.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 50 \n\n \n \nand submit investigations at the 45 day mark thereby allowing supervisors time to review \nand ask for additional information as needed.  \n \nCP&P has not specifically addressed case record review recommendations related to \ninterviewing fathers of alleged child victims or interviewing subject children alone.  \n \nOn April 1, 2013, DCF instituted a new regulation that modified the system used to designate \nfindings following completion of an investigation.86 Previously, DCF had a two tier system in \nwhich a finding was designated as either substantiated or unfounded.  The new regulation adopts \na four tier system in which a finding can be designated as either substantiated, established, not \nestablished or unfounded.  This change has resulted in DCF’s ability to maintain the records of  \nchildren in which the investigation determined that they were harmed or exposed to risk of harm, \neven where the statutory definition of child abuse or neglect could not be met. Maintaining these \nrecords provides workers with a more accurate history of families that can inform their \nassessments when new referrals are received.  \n \nC.  Institutional Abuse Investigative Unit (IAIU):  Investigations of Allegations of Child \nMaltreatment in Placements \n \nThe Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) is responsible for investigating allegations of \nchild abuse and neglect in child care facilities, detention centers, schools, and residential \nfacilities, resource family care homes and other out-of-home care settings.87  From January to \nDecember 2013, IAIU received 3,182 referrals. This is an increase of 184 referrals (6%) over the \nsame period in 2012.

Instead, the 60 day completion standard applies to \nall IAIU investigations.   In reviewing IAIU performance, the Monitor requests data separately \non investigations of maltreatment in foster care settings (resource family homes and congregate \ncare facilities) as well as from other settings (e.g., schools, day care).  Table 2 displays IAIU’s \nreported overall performance for the dates cited, in addition to the timeliness of completion of \ninvestigations in resource family homes and congregate care facilities.

IAIU Investigations Corrective Action Monitoring  \n \nEvery IAIU investigation results in a finding letter which is sent to a facility or resource home.  \nThis letter cites the investigative conclusion and, when applicable, identifies concerns and makes \na request for corrective action. Every finding letter is sent to DCF’s Office of Licensing (OOL). \nWhen a request for corrective action is made, DCF policy is that the facility administrator or the \nresource home unit responsible for supervising the resource home is required to develop and \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 53 \n\n \n \nsubmit a corrective action plan (CAP) within 30 calendar days of the date on the IAIU finding \nletter.88  IAIU’s Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) staff is responsible for monitoring the \ndevelopment and implementation of corrective action plans to assure satisfactory resolution of all \nconcerns identified in the finding letter. CQI staff are also responsible for determining whether \nthe CAP is successfully completed and whether it is approved, disapproved or will remain open \nand pending. All CAPs require the submission of supporting documentation to confirm the plan \nwas implemented and completed. As a result, CAPs remain open until all documentation is \nreceived.  DCF policy does not stipulate time frames for when CQI staff must approve \nsuccessfully completed CAPs. Time frames for the successful completion of CAPs vary \naccording to the elements of the plan. For example, a CAP may include intensive monitoring of a \nresource home for a six month period. In that instance, IAIU’s CQI staff will review \ndocumentation of the six month monitoring to determine whether the identified concerns have \nbeen addressed and, once they are addressed, will approve the CAP as successfully completed.  \n \nBetween April and December 2013, IAIU issued 449 corrective action requests involving \nresource family homes, group homes, and residential facilities where children were placed.  \nInformation reported from the IAIU corrective action database indicate that 276 (61%) of 449 \nCAPs had been approved as successfully completed and 175 (39%) corrective action requests \nwere outstanding or pending resolution as of December 31, 2013. Of the 175, 19 CAPS are not \nyet due.   \n \nReview of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) \n \nThe Monitor reviewed ten randomly selected corrective action requests that resulted from \ninvestigation findings between April and December 2013 to look at feedback processes between \nIAIU and other divisions (e.g. OOL) and to ensure CAPs are being developed and implemented.  \nThe sample included three resource family homes, two kinship resource homes, three group \nhomes and two residential facilities. CAPs were developed and submitted for eight of the ten \nrequests; four of the eight were developed and submitted within 30 days from the date of the \nfinding letter.  IAIU’s CQI staff accepted six of the eight CAPs as successfully implemented.  \nThe remaining two of the eight CAPs were pending while staff awaited supporting \ndocumentation. CAPs from this sample resulted in the removal of children from resource homes, \nthe monitoring of resource homes, the reduction of a resource home’s capacity, the suspension of \nresource homes, the closing of a resource home, the re-training of resource parents and facility \nstaff on CP&P policies and procedures, the training of a resource parent and facility staff and the \ntermination of staff at a group home and at a residential facility.  \n \nAdditionally, the Monitor reviewed five randomly selected corrective action requests resulting \nfrom investigation finding letters dated between April and December 2013 which were pending \napproval as successfully completed by IAIU CQI staff ninety days and beyond.  The CAPs \npending approval were reviewed to determine the reasons why they remained pending and if \nIAIU staff were following up appropriately on the identified concerns. The sample included four \nresource family homes and one kinship family home.

CAPs in this sample were not accepted because OOL violations remained open \nand unabated, the CAP did not comprehensively address all concerns identified and \ndocumentation verifying that a resource parent completed training was missing.  For the two \nCAPs in the sample that had not been developed and submitted as of December 31, 2013, there \nwas evidence that IAIU staff’ had sent letters and emails to supervisors of resource home units to \nfollow up on the CAP.    \n \nThe CAPs reviewed appeared to adequately address the incidents which prompted the IAIU \ninvestigation.  There was evidence of appropriate communication between divisions in all cases \nreviewed, particularly between IAIU and OOL regarding the licensure of resource homes and \nfacilities under investigation.   All communication on record occurred via email or inter-office \nmemos.  In addition, IAIU hosts monthly “systems partners” meetings with OOL and SCR to \nensure that concerns identified during IAIU investigations are communicated to all the system \npartners. The Monitor plans on attending these meetings during the next monitoring period.  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 55 \n\n \n \nV.  IMPLEMENTING THE CASE PRACTICE MODEL \n \nDCF continues to train on and reinforce high quality case practice according to New Jersey’s \nCase Practice Model (CPM). The CPM is designed to guide and support staff towards a strength-\nbased and family-centered approach that ensures the safety, permanency and well-being of \nchildren. This practice requires engagement with children, youth and families through teamwork \nand crafting individualized case plans with families and children.  \n \nDCF is holding weekly conference calls among DCF leadership, Area Directors and their Local \nOffice manager to review individual performance on specific key indicators, including visitation, \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) and case plan development. These weekly calls have led to more \nconsistent use of quantitative and qualitative data to support positive outcomes for children and \nfamilies. \n \nThe Performance Measures discussed below measure progress on some of the CPM activities \nusing data from NJ SPIRIT and data collected during the state’s QR process, a case review \nprocess led by DCF’s Office of Quality discussed in more detail in Section XIV.   \n \nA.  Activities Supporting the Implementation of the Case Practice Model \n \nA critical component of CP&P’s CPM is its focus on coaching, facilitating and supervising \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs), where families and their formal and informal supports meet to \ndiscuss the families’ progress.  CP&P continues to build its capacity to hold FTMs, primarily \nthrough its Implementation Specialists. CP&P has ten Implementation Specialists, one in each \narea. Their primary responsibility is to provide ongoing assistance to staff to practice according \nto the CPM.  Implementation Specialists train and mentor staff to serve as facilitators, coaches \nand master coaches who conduct FTMs and implement the CPM.89  They also conduct training at \nLocal Offices tailored to staff needs, particularly on topics related to effective engagement of  \nfamilies and building appropriate and functioning teams that support families.  \n \nAs of December 31, 2013, DCF developed 2,211 staff as FTM facilitators, 324 as coaches and \n142 as master coaches. Table 3 shows the number of facilitators, coaches and master coaches by \nCP&P area.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n89 Coaches are CP&P staff of varying levels who are trained specifically to lead FTMs; master coaches train Local \nOffice and Area staff to become facilitators and coaches. Facilitators are trained to conduct Family Team Meetings \naccording to protocol and the principles and values of DCF’s CPM.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

At the ChildStat meetings Local Office leadership \npresent practice issues, including data on key performance indicators from the most recent two \nfiscal quarters compared with statewide data. As additional offices participate in ChildStat, more \nstaff from many levels within DCF have become better able to use data to assess Local Office \nperformance.  During this monitoring period DCF’s focus for the ChildStat process was cases \ninvolving families who had a prior unfounded CPS investigation within 12 months of a current \n                                                 \n90 Drawn from CompStat in New York City, ChildStat is a process wherein organizations use quantitative and \nqualitative data from multiple contexts to understand and attempt to improve service delivery.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 57 \n\n \n \nreferral.  During the next monitoring period, DCF will shift its focus to include cases involving \nfamilies whose children have been reunited with them between three and six months prior to the \nChildStat meeting.  The focus will be on the quality of the case practice and services offered to \nfamilies in their own home to encourage and promote engagement with service providers in the \ncommunity, frequently an important feature of successful reunification.   DCF has expanded the \nnumber of outside stakeholders and partners who now attend its ChildStat meetings.  The \nMonitor continues to regularly attend DCF’s ChildStat meetings and supports DCF’s progress in \npromoting self-examination and diagnosis through quality data.  \n \nConcurrent Planning Practice \n \nDCF workers hold case reviews at five and ten months into a child’s placement for staff to \naddress concurrent planning, a practice used throughout the country in which workers work with \nfamilies with children in out-of-home placement to reunify children as quickly as possible while \nsimultaneously pursuing alternative permanency options should reunification efforts fail.  Staff \nalso conduct “enhanced reviews” after a child has been in placement for five and ten months to \ncarry out its concurrent planning required by the MSA. Enhanced reviews occur in all CP&P \nLocal Offices. \n \nStatewide, in December 2013, 99 percent of applicable families had required five month \nreviews, and 94 percent had required ten month reviews. \n \nAs Table 4 reflects, in December 2013, 99 percent of five month reviews due that month were \ncompleted timely statewide.  Between April and December 2013, monthly performance on this \nmeasure ranged from 93 to 100 percent. \n  \n \nTable 4:  Five Month Enhanced Review \n(April–December 2013) \n \nApr-13  May-13  Jun-13  Jul-13  Aug-13  Sep-13  Oct-13  Nov-13  Dec-13 \n \n#  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  %  #  % \nReviews \nCompleted w/in  254   98%    259  100%  289   100%  267     98%  295    99%  288     93%   367   98%  299  99%  273    99% \nfive months \nReviews Not \nCompleted w/in  6    2%  1      0%  1     0%  6      2%    2      1%   23     7%     7   2%     3    1%   4     1% \nfive months \nTotals  260  100%  260  100%  290  100%  273  100%  297  100%  311  100%  374  100%  302  100%  277  100% \nSource:  DCF data \n \n \nTable 5 shows that statewide in December 2013, 94 percent of ten month reviews due that month \nwere completed timely.

Christie  Page 59 \n\n \n \nB.  Performance Measures on Family Team Meetings and Case Planning \n \nFamily Team Meetings (FTMs) are intended to work in concert with individualized case \nplanning to support improved results for children and families. Workers are trained and coached \nto hold FTMs at key decision points in the life of a case, such as when a child enters placement, \nwhen a child has a change of placement and/or when there is a need to adjust a case plan.  \nWorking at optimal capacity, FTMs enable families, providers, formal and informal supports to \nexchange information that can be critical to coordinating and following up on services, \nexamining and solving problems, and achieving positive outcomes.  Meetings are to be \nscheduled according to the family’s availability in an effort to get as many family members and \nfamily supports as possible around the table. Engaging the family, the core of New Jersey’s \nCPM, is a critical component of successful family teaming.  \n \nThere has been improvement in performance on incorporating FTMs as a consistent part of \nDCF’s case practice.  The improvement has been slower than desired despite intensive efforts to \ntrain, coach and supervise staff over the past several years.  During this monitoring period, DCF \nfocused on diagnosing the root cause of some of these challenges, including how to accurately \nassess and document those families that do not want to or are unavailable to participate in FTMs.  \nTwo implementation specialists and 23 Master Coaches conducted an “FTM Focus Pilot” in \nHudson and Bergen counties for families requiring FTMs between December 13, 2013 and \nJanuary 31, 2014.  The pilot was designed to explore whether the assignment of a designated \nfacilitator would positively impact the quality, rate of completion and documentation of FTMs. \nDCF hopes to learn from the FTM Focus Pilot whether to modify its current model of conducting \nFTMs.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 60 \n\n \n \nFamily Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings \n \n \n7.  Family Involvement and Effective Use of Family Team Meetings:   A family \nteam (involving parents, youth and appropriate formal and informal supports) \nshall meet and plan together. The team should be involved in planning & \ndecision making throughout a case and have the skills, family knowledge and \nabilities to solve and help to organize effective services for the child and family.  \nQuantitative or \nNumber of family team meetings at key decision points: \nQualitative Measure   \na.  For children newly entering placement, the number/percent who have a \nfamily team meeting within 30 days of entry. \nb.  For all other children in placement, the number/percent who have at least \none family team meeting each quarter. \nc.  Family Teamwork\n \na.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held prior to or within 30 days of entry \nfor 90% of new entries and 90% of pre-placements. \nb.  By June 30, 2010, family meetings held for 90% of children at least once \nFinal Target \nper quarter. \nc.  By June 30, 2011, 90% of cases show evidence in QR of acceptable team \nformation and functioning. \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nWhile performance improved, DCF did not meet the final target requiring FTMs for 90 percent \nof children prior to or within 30 days of a child entering foster care, for pre-placements, and at \nleast once per quarter thereafter.   \n \nDuring the previous monitoring period and continuing from April through December 2013, DCF \nwas engaged in an effort with Area Directors, Local Office managers and line staff to both \nimprove engagement with parents to encourage participation in FTMs and to improve \ndocumentation and data entry to account for legitimate reasons why FTMs do not occur, either \nbecause the parent is unavailable or because the parent declined to attend. The parties agreed \nthat, consistent with the previous monitoring period, while the state was involved in this self-\ndiagnosis and corrective action, the report’s documented progress would include only the \nnumber of FTMs that have actually occurred. After the conclusion of the monitoring period, \nDCF provided the Monitor with additional data indicating that after successfully clarifying and \nimplementing policy, it had confidence that workers were properly using and documenting \nexceptions and with that information had approached reaching the final target on this \nperformance measure. Given the timing, the Monitor has not yet been able to conduct the case \nreview needed to validate this data. The Monitor and DCF will conduct a statistically valid case \nrecord review to validate the data and issue a supplemental letter on this measure prior to the \nnext full monitoring report.  \n \nAccording to NJ SPIRIT data, and counting only those FTMs that actually occurred, in \nDecember 2013, out of 295 possible FTMs, 202 (69%) occurred within 30 days of removal; from \nApril to December 2013, monthly performance ranged from 43 to 69 percent.  Appendix B-1 \nprovides performance data on FTMs held within 30 days by Local Office for the month of \nDecember 2013. The state’s performance on FTMs that occurred (even without excluding from \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Christie  Page 67 \n\n \n \nAs Figure 10 indicates, DCF did not meet the target requiring that 90 percent of cases rate as \nacceptable for case planning and service plans as measured by the QR. Cases rated as acceptable \ndemonstrate evidence that the child and families’ needs are addressed in the case plan, the plan \ndirectly addresses the needs and risks that brought the child to DCF’s attention, appropriate \nfamily members were included in the plan and the implementation of the service process is being \ntracked and adjusted when necessary. DCF results of 133 cases reviewed from April through \nDecember 2013 indicate that 41 percent of cases were rated as acceptable on both QR indicators \n‘Case Planning Process’ and ‘Tracking and Adjusting’.97 To specifically address concerns about \nthe quality of the case planning process, DCF’s Office of Training and Professional \nDevelopment partnered with Area and Local Office leadership to pilot a new, customized, on site \nTransfer of Learning (TOL) training model on case planning that features “real time” evaluation \ntools and strategies for supervisors and workers.   \n \n \nFigure 10: Cases Rated Acceptable on Quality of Case and Service Planning \n(April–December 2013) \n (n=133) \n \n100%\nFinal Target (90%) \ng\nn\nnni 80%\na\nPl\ne \ns\na\nC 60%\nof \ne \ng\na\nnt\nrce 40% 41%\ne\nP (54)\n20%\n0%\nCases Rated Acceptable\n \nSource:  DCF, QR results \nReported performance based upon QR results from cases reviewed between April to December 2013.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n97 54 of 133 (41%) in and out-of-home cases rated acceptable on both the Case Planning Process and Tracking and \nAdjusting indicators; 62 of 133 cases (47%) rated acceptable on Case Planning Process; and 79 of 133 cases (59%) \nrated acceptable on Tracking and Adjusting. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As Figure 11 indicates, performance on this \nmeasure based on April through December 2013 QR results is 67 percent acceptable.  Forty-nine \ncases were applicable for this performance measure because cases must involve children five and \nolder and in out-of-home placement.  For cases rated as acceptable, there was evidence of few \ndisruptions of school settings and a low risk of such disruptions as well as evidence that the \nchildren were achieving key development milestones. Thirty-three of 49 applicable cases (67%) \nrated acceptable on both the Stability (school) and Learning and Development (age 5 and older) \nQR indicators99.  \n                                                 \n98 As noted, although 133 cases were reviewed for the QR, only 49 involved children over the age of 5 and in out-\nof-home placement.  \n99 Fifty-seven of 67 cases (85%) rated acceptable on Stability (school); 42 of 52 (81%) cases rated acceptable on \nLearning and Development (age 5 and older).    \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Performance Benchmarks Related to Safety and Risk Assessment \n \nIndividualized, comprehensive assessment is a process in which information concerning the \nneeds, problems, circumstances and resources of the family, youth and children are collected, \nevaluated and updated at key points of decision-making and whenever major changes in family \ncircumstances occur.  The decision to close a case should reflect the achievement of satisfactory \noutcomes with regard to the children or youth's safety, permanence and well-being.  An \nassessment of both safety and risk prior to case closure is necessary to ensure these outcomes \nhave been achieved. \n \n \nSafety and Risk Assessment \n \nQuantitative or  8.  Safety and Risk Assessment:  Number/percent of closed cases where a safety \nQualitative Measure  and risk of harm assessment is done prior to case closure. \nBy December 31, 2010, (a) 98% of investigations will have a safety assessment \ncompleted, (b) 98% of investigations will have a risk assessment completed and (c) \nFinal Target \n98% of non-investigation cases will have a risk assessment or risk re-assessment \ncompleted within 30 days of case closure.100 \n \n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nPerformance during the months of April through December 2013 for both safety and risk \nassessments completed prior to investigation completion exceeded the 98 percent required by the \nMSA final target.   For example, in December 2013, there were 4,519 applicable101 investigation \ncases closed.  Of these 4,519 investigations, 4,518 (100%) investigations had a safety assessment \ncompleted prior to investigation completion and 4,519 (100%) investigations had a risk \nassessment completed prior to investigation completion. \n \nPerformance on conducting a risk reassessment 30 days prior to non-investigative case closure \nranged from 61 to 94 percent (see Figure 12) between the months of April through December \n2013. For example, in December 2013, there were 675 applicable102 cases closed. Of these 675 \ncases, 623 (92%) cases had a risk reassessment completed within 30 days prior to case closure; \n17 (3%) cases had a risk reassessment completed within 31 to 60 days prior to case closure. Data \nby Local Office for December 2013 reflects a performance range between 72 and 100 percent \n                                                 \n100 In order to be consistent with practice expectations, in May 2012, the Parties agreed to revise the final target \nfrom, “By December 31, 2010, 98% of cases will have a safety and risk of harm assessment completed prior to case \nclosure” to the language stated above, which allows for separate reporting on investigations and non-investigations \ncases.   \n101 In December 2013, an additional 23 investigations were closed; however, those cases were marked as “unable to \nmake contact with children/family” and were excluded from the calculations. \n102Applicable cases include reunification and do not include adoption, kinship legal guardianship or emancipation. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF added a hard edit to NJ SPIRIT on May 23, 2013 that requires a risk \nassessment to be complete before the NJ SPIRIT system will allow staff to close a case. This \nhard edit has resulted in a significant improvement in performance.   \n \n \nFigure 12:  Performance on Safety Assessments Completed prior to Investigation \nCompletion, Risk Assessments Completed prior to Investigation Completion and Risk \nReassessments Completed within 30 days prior to Case Closure \n(April–December 2013) \n \n100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%    100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\n100% Final  \n92% 92% 93% 92% 94% 92% Target \n89%  (98%) \n80%\n75%\n61%\n60%\n40%\n20%\n0%\nApr-13 May-13 Jun-13 Jul-13 Aug-13 Sep-13 Oct-13 Nov-13 Dec-13\nRisk Assessment Prior to Investigation Completion\nSafety Assessment Prior to Investigation Completion\nRisk Reassessments Prior to Case Closure\n \n    Source:  DCF data \n \n   \n                                                 \n103 Cases assigned to adoption workers are included in Appendix D-2 only for the few cases where the goal of the \nchild in placement was changed from adoption to reunification.

Christie  Page 71 \n\n \n \nD.  Performance Measures on Caseworker, Parent-Child and Sibling Visits \n \nThe visits of children with their workers, parents and siblings are integral to the principles of the \nCPM and are important events that can ensure children’s safety, maintain and strengthen family \nconnections, and increase children’s opportunities to achieve permanency.   \n \nThe state’s performance for most MSA visitation measures remained relatively unchanged, with \nthe exception of visits between siblings who are not placed together, which improved by eight \npercent.  Local Office data were reviewed for several measures and as stated in the previous \nmonitoring period, variations in performance are evident.  Local Office data for those measures \nare discussed below and can be found in Appendices B-4 through B-6.  \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the Monitor and DCF agreed to use a new methodology to \ndetermine performance for caseworker visits with parents.  The previous methodology excluded \ninstances where a caseworker documented that a parent was unavailable or did not require a visit.  \nAnalysis of a sample of these cases found that these exceptions were not consistently applied in \nan appropriate manner.  Performance for the current monitoring period does not exclude these \ninstances and only reports compliance for those visits that actually occurred.  Due to this change, \ncurrent performance is not comparable with previously reported performance when the \nexceptions were applied.   \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN IN OUT-OF-HOME CARE \n \nAs of December 31, 2013, a total of 52,255 children were receiving CP&P services: 7,330 in out-\nof-home placement and 44,925 in their own homes.  Figure 20 shows the type of placement for \nchildren in CP&P custody as of December 31, 2013:  89 percent were in resource family homes \n(either kinship or non-kinship), nine percent in group and residential facilities and two percent in \nindependent living facilities.  As shown in Figure 20, the number of children placed with kin is \nnow substantial, representing 38 percent of the children in out-of-home placement.  One of the \nstate’s accomplishments since the start of the MSA has been the significant reduction of children \nin out-of-home care. \n \n \nFigure 20:  Children in CP&P Out-of-Home Placement by Type of Placement \nas of December 31, 2013 \n(n=7,330) \n \nIndependent Living\nGroup and \n123\nResidential \n2%\n689\n9%\nResource \nFamily\n(Non-Kin) \n3,758\nKinship Care  51%\n2,760\n38%\n \n Source:  DCF data \n \n \nTable 11 shows selected demographics for children in out-of-home placement as of December \n31, 2013.

When compared to performance in 2007 (25% of applications resolved in 150 days), \nDCF has improved significantly in its efforts to reach the 150 day timeframe.  DCF has taken \nsteps to further improve this performance, including forming an Impact Team Workgroup \ncomprised of staff from Local Office resource family units, area resource family specialists and \nstaff from the Office and Resource Families (ORF) and Office of Licensing (OOL).  Based on \nfindings from the Workgroup that kinship applications tend to encounter more challenges and \ndelays than non-kinship applications, DCF implemented a new Resource Family Impact Team \nprocess that more intensely monitors kinship applications.  Under the new system, monthly \nImpact Team conferences now focus on pending non-kinship applications after day 50 of the 150 \nday timeframe, unless there is an identified problem that surfaces earlier.  All kinship \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As previously reported, the \nstate developed and has been using a specialized recruitment strategy to focus attention on \nidentifying, recruiting and licensing these homes, termed “Siblings in Best Settings” or SIBS. At \nthe end of this reporting period, DCF had 29 SIBS homes, a net increase of four homes from the \nprevious monitoring period; eleven SIBS homes were newly licensed between April and \nDecember 2013.114 Recruiting homes for large sibling groups continues to be a priority need. \n \n \n                                                 \n114 Seven homes left the SIBS program: three homes closed upon adoption finalization, one closed due to the \nprovider’s health circumstances, one home closed due to the reunification of the children with their biological \nparents, one home closed due to the court determining that placement with other relatives was preferred as the \nparents had not sufficiently complied with licensing requirements. Another home downgraded from SIBS status \nwhen the resource parents determined the large number of siblings was too difficult to manage. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 90 \n\n \n \nAssistance from the National Resource Center for Recruitment and Retention of Foster and \nAdoptive Parents (NRCRRFAP) \n \nDCF’s work with the National Resource Center for Recruitment and Retention of Foster and \nAdoptive Parents at Adopt US Kids (NRCRRFAP) continued this monitoring period.  Eleven \ncounties115 were identified to participate in NRCRRFAP’s “market segmentation” approach \nusing a marketing research tool that helps identify households by geographic area and lifestyle \ncharacteristics that are most similar to those in which DCF is currently successful in placing \nchildren. Recruiters have used the data obtained from this “market segmentation” approach to \ninform local recruitment plans and strategies.  Recognizing the need to increase the pool of \nfamilies willing to accept large sibling groups, DCF is requiring all recruiters to identify large \nsibling groups as a primary objective in their 2014 Local Office Recruitment Plans. The next step \nplanned for the “market segmentation” approach is using the data to determine effective \nmessaging targeted to potential resource families for adolescents and large sibling groups.  \n \nStaff Training and Skill Development \n \nResource family and licensing staff participated in training opportunities during this monitoring \nperiod, including:  \n \n  PRIDE (Parent Resources for Information, Development and Education) Train the \nTrainer—this course is a four day training for all resource family trainers.   \n  PRIDE and Traditions of Caring (TOC) Pre-service training for prospective resource \nparents.   \n  Joint OOL and Resource Family Support Workers (RFSWs)—this course is a two day \ntraining designed for new OOL and RFSW staff so they understand the practice and \nprocesses of their respective departments and what is involved in licensing a home.  \n \nResource Family In-Service Training  \n \nEvery resource parent is required to complete In-Service training to maintain a resource family \nhome license.  The training modalities which are offered to resource parents by Foster and \nAdoptive Family Services (FAFS) are: on-line training, home correspondence courses, county-\nbased workshops and, new this monitoring period, e-live webinars.   \n \nBetween April and December 2013, 686 resource parents took a total of 1,488 in-service courses. \nFAFS offers a wide variety of topics, including:  \n  \n  The Child Health Program, \n  The Educational Stability Act, \n  Suicide and Depression, \n  Discipline, and \n  Working with DCF.  \n \n                                                 \n115 Mercer, Sussex, Camden, Monmouth, Morris, Essex, Cumberland, Ocean, Middlesex, Gloucester and Salem. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Exceptions can \nbe made to these limits as follows: no more than five percent of resource home placements may \nbe made into resource homes with seven or eight total children including the resource family’s \nown children, but such placements can be made as long as there is adherence to the other \nlimitations referred to above.  Any of the limitations may be waived if needed and appropriate to \nallow a group of siblings to be placed together.  \n \nEach reporting period the Monitor reviews the waivers to population limits DCF granted for the \nmonitoring period to validate that they fall within the designated capacity limitations.  During \nthis monitoring period less than one percent of resource home placements were over capacity.  \n \nThe Monitor reviewed the five waivers to populations limits granted between April and \nDecember 2013 and each of these waivers were deemed appropriate. Of the five waivers granted, \nthree were approved for children to be placed in homes with over four children; one for a child \nwho was related to the resource parent; one for a child with behavioral issues who had previously \nbeen placed in the home, and another to keep a sibling group together.  Another waiver was \napproved for a child to be placed in a home with more than two children under two because the \nplacement was anticipated to be short term; the child was reunited with his father in less than one \nmonth. A final waiver was granted during the monitoring period for a child to be placed in a \nhome with six children because the child was attending the resource parent’s daycare prior to \nbeing placed in the resource parent’s home and was comfortable with the resource parent.  \n \nDCF continues to meet the MSA performance target for this outcome.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

REPEAT MALTREATMENT AND RE-ENTRY INTO CARE \n \nThe state is responsible for ensuring the safety of children who are receiving or have received \nservices from CP&P.  This responsibility includes ensuring the safety of children who are placed \nin resource family homes and congregate facilities.  As detailed below, the MSA includes a \nnumber of measures on repeat maltreatment, maltreatment while in care and re-entry into care.  \nGiven this is a longitudinal measure, the most recent data available for repeat maltreatment and \nre-entry into foster care are from CY 2012.   \n \nIn the previous monitoring report, CY 2011 data (the most recent calendar year available) \nindicated that CP&P’s performance for repeat maltreatment of children within one year of \nreunification and re-entry of children within one year of their exit from care did not meet the \nMSA standards.  In fact, repeat maltreatment data showed a concerning rise in the number of \nchildren with substantiated abuse or neglect within one year of reunification.  CP&P recognized \nthe need for data analysis and strategy development to address performance for these measures \nand beginning this monitoring period, they implemented the following activities to better \nunderstand factors associated with repeat maltreatment:  \n \n  Analyzing data to look for trends by Local Office, age of child, allegation type and other \nvariables to assist leadership in understanding the trends in their counties and what action \nmay be needed to address performance.  Additionally, CP&P is partnering with Rutgers \nUniversity to conduct a multivariate analysis of repeat maltreatment to better understand \nthe factors most related to this outcome.   \n  Constructing area and Local Office level datasets with individual cases of repeat \nmaltreatment within 12 months of exit for children who exited between January and June \n2012.  Local Offices will be required to conduct a qualitative case record review of these \ncases to identify the precipitating factors that lead to the repeat maltreatment and identify \ncase practice themes for targeted improvement.  \n  Focusing the work of the current cohort of DCF Fellows on statewide increases in out-of-\nhome placements which include children re-entering care after reunification. DCF \nanticipates that this analysis will identify risk factors that lead to initial entries as well as \nre-entries into care.  \n  Changing the focus of ChildStat to review cases that have recently reunified within three \nto six months of reunification to better understand CP&P’s role in supporting families \nwhen children return home.  \n \nThe current data demonstrate a small increase in CY 2013 in the percent of children who were \nvictims of abuse or neglect while in out-of-home care (although performance continues to meet \nthe MSA standard).  Consistent with CY 2011, DCF has not met the measure related to repeat \nmaltreatment of children within one year of reunification. The state’s performance for children \nwho re-enter out-of-home care within one year of discharge has remained constant at 13 percent \nsince CY 2010 and does not meet the final target of no more than nine percent of children re-\nentering care.  \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

As of December 31, 2013, of the 5,675 \nchildren, 430 (7.6%) children were the victims of a substantiated allegation of child abuse and/or \nneglect within 12 months of the initial substantiation. 121  Although DCF had previously met this \n                                                 \n120 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates. \n121 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates.  There was a slight change in methodology in analyzing data in CY \n2011 and later.  Performance for calendar years prior to 2011 was analyzed by assessing the date of the initial \nsubstantiated report to the date of the subsequent substantiated report.  Performance for CY 2011 and 2012 was \nanalyzed by assessing the date of the initial substantiated report to the date of the subsequent incident which resulted \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

This rate of repeat maltreatment \ncontinues to exceed the MSA final target that no more than 4.8 percent of children who reunified \nwill be victims of substantiated abuse and/or neglect within one year after reunification.  DCF \nand the Monitor continue to be concerned about these occurrences and the reasons that the repeat \nmaltreatment rate remains high.   \n \n \nRe-entry to Placement \n \n33.

CY 2011 and 2012 \ndata analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates.   \n \n \nPerformance as of CY 2012 (Most Recent Calendar Year Available):  \n \nIn CY 2012, there were 5,335 children who exited foster care; 3,883 (73%) children exited to \nqualifying exits (i.e., reunification, guardianship or to a relative placement).122,123  Of the 3,883 \nchildren who exited to qualifying exits, 518 (13%) children re-entered placement as of \nDecember 31, 2013.  While the percentage of children re-entering care has declined since CY \n2007, performance has leveled off at 13 percent since CY 2010 and does not meet the final target \nof no more than nine percent of children re-entering custody within one year of exit.  \n   \n                                                 \n122 Data analyzed by Hornby Zeller Associates. \n123 DCF has objected to the Monitor’s definition of “qualifying exits” used to analyze this measure.  The Agency \nbelieves that due to the specific exclusion cited in the MSA, the definition of qualifying exits should only exclude \nchildren who run away from placement.  The Monitor uses a definition of qualifying exits which excludes from the \ncalculations runaways as well as children who are adopted.  Based on the DCF recommended definition, of all \nchildren who exited in CY 2012, 10 percent re-entered custody within one year of the date of exit.  Using that \ndefinition, DCF calculates performance for previous years as follows: CY 2007, 12%; CY 2008, 10%; CY 2009, \n10%; CY 2010, 9% CY 2011 9%. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 103 \n\n \n \nVIII.  TIMELY PERMANENCY THROUGH REUNIFICATION, ADOPTION OR \nLEGAL GUARDIANSHIP \n \nAll children—regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity—need and deserve a safe, nurturing \nfamily to protect and guide them. In child welfare work, this is called “permanency.” \nPermanency can be achieved through a number of different avenues; safe family reunification is \nthe preferred choice, but permanency also includes kinship legal guardianship and adoption.  \nThe MSA requires that children in custody achieve timely permanency through reunification, \nadoption or legal guardianship (Section III.A.2.a).   \n \nThe MSA permanency measures reflect an expectation that children entering custody will attain \npermanency in a timely manner through whatever is their most appropriate permanency pathway.  \nThe measures were designed to avoid creating unintended incentives in favor of one permanency \npath (e.g., reunification or adoption) over another.  The measures also seek to examine \nperformance and set realistic permanency expectations and timeframes for children who have \nnewly entered foster care and how long they remain in care as well as for those children and \nyouth who have been in care for extended periods of time.   \n \nThe permanency measures discussed below include timeframe to permanency for different \ncohorts of children—discharged within 12 months of removal, between 13 and 24 months from \nremoval and 25 months or longer from removal.  Performance is based on calendar year and the \nmost recent data are presented.  This section also includes the state’s performance on timely \ndischarge specific to adoption as well as several process measures related to adoption practice \nincluding timeliness with which petitions to terminate parental rights have been filed, child-\nspecific recruitment plans have been developed, children have been placed in an adoptive home \nand an adoptive home placement has been finalized.   \n \nOverall, DCF’s performance in discharging children to permanency has improved slightly but \ndoes not meet the final targets required by the MSA. While DCF’s adoption practice \ndemonstrates strengths, the report also identifies challenges, most notably around the goal of \nachieving permanency for children who exit to adoption within 30 months of their removal.  \nDCF also declined in performance in identifying adoptive homes at the time of termination of \nparental rights and completion of child specific recruitment plans for applicable children. The \nMonitor acknowledges that adoption work is complex and that delays in court processing and \nappeal processes can impact the time to finalize an adoption.  The Monitor encourages DCF to \nclosely examine performance in this area to identify barriers and strategies for improvement.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

All four vacant positions were approved for new hires to fill the vacancy.  In \naddition, seven paralegal positions were filled at DCF’s central office. \n \nAdditionally, DCF continues to contract with Children’s Home Society to provide 23 child \nsummary writers statewide and up to six part-time adoption expediters who assist with adoption \npaperwork in counties throughout the state.    \n \n \nProgress Toward Adoption \n \n \n35.

This plan should be developed within 30 days of the change to \nan adoption goal.   \n \nBetween April and December 2013, of the 147 children requiring child-specific recruitment \nplans,135 55 (37%) had a child-specific recruitment plan developed within 30 days of the goal \nchange (see Table 18). An additional 29 (20%) cases had a child-specific recruitment plan \ndeveloped within 60 days, and 13 (9%) eligible select home adoption cases had a plan developed \nover 60 days from the goal change. Fifty (34%) child-specific plans were not completed by the \ntime the data were provided.136  Current performance demonstrates a continued steady decline in \ntimely completion of child specific recruitment plans (see Figure 38 above) and an increase in \nthe percentage of plans not completed.  During the previous monitoring period (July 2012 \nthrough March 2013), 15 percent of plans were not completed and, as shown above, this doubled \nto 34 percent this period.  \n \n                                                 \n135 Due to the small number of eligible cases per month, this measure is reported by aggregating the monthly data. \n136 April-June 2013 data were extracted on August 1, 2013; July-September 2013 data were extracted as of \nOctober 22, 2013; and October-December 2013 data were extracted on March 5, 2014. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN OUT-OF-HOME PLACEMENT \n \nThe provision of appropriate health care services to children in DCF’s custody has been a \nprincipal focus of the MSA and the DCF’s reform agenda.  Since June 2011, DCF has \nmaintained or improved performance on nearly all Performance Measures related to health care \nservices.137  These Performance Measures track DCF’s progress in ensuring that children in out-\nof-home placement receive: \n \n  Pre-placement medical assessments (MSA Section II.F.5); \n  Full medical examinations (known as Comprehensive Medical Examinations or \nCMEs) (MSA Section II.B.11); \n  Medical examinations in compliance with Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis \nand Treatment (EPSDT) guidelines; \n  Semi-annual dental examinations for children ages three and older (MSA Section \nII.F.2); \n  Mental health assessments of children with suspected mental health needs (MSA \nSection II.F.2); \n  Timely, accessible and appropriate follow-up and treatment (MSA Section II.F.2); \nand \n  Immunizations. \n \nAlthough not used to directly assess MSA compliance, DCF’s QR found that 96 percent of \ncases138 scored at least minimally acceptable on the provision of health care services, a very \npositive finding consistent with performance on the measures discussed below. \n \nThis section provides updates of ongoing efforts to improve policies, staffing and access to \nservices, which are necessary to realize and sustain positive health outcomes for children as well \nas information about the health care received by children in out-of-home placement.139  The \ndelivery of a child’s medical information (through the Health Passport) to a new caregiver within \nfive days of placement in his/her home is also assessed. \n \nDCF regularly carries out a Health Care Case Record Review that analyzes the follow-up care \nchildren receive for concerns identified in CMEs; mental health screenings, assessments and \nfollow-up care; and timely delivery of the health passport to resource parents.  Because these \nreviews are labor intensive and consistently done every six months, the Monitor did not require a \nspecial review, given the extended monitoring period, to assess performance through December \n                                                 \n137 The one exception is the performance measure requiring 95 percent of caregivers receive a current Health \nPassport within five days of a child’s placement where performance as of July 2013 is 65 percent. \n138 Out of 133 cases reviewed through the QR during the monitoring period, 127 (96%) scored at least minimally \nacceptable on the provision of health care services. \n139 The Monitor has previously verified health care outcomes through a case record review. See Appendix C of \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families: Period VI Monitoring Report for Charlie and \nNadine H. v. Christie – January 1 to June 30, 2009, Washington, DC: Center for the Study of Social Policy, \nDecember 22, 2009.

Christie  Page 118 \n\n \n \n2013.  The most recent case record review includes a random sample of children in out-of-home \nplacement who were removed between November 1, 2012 and July 31, 2013 and were in care a \nminimum of 60 days. Thus, for the health care Performance Measures based on case record \nreview findings, performance is reported through July 31, 2013. \n \nA.  Health Care Delivery System \n \nChild Health Units \n \nThe Child Health Units are a fundamental cornerstone of the provision of health care to children \nin CP&P custody.  These units are in each CP&P Local Office and are staffed with a clinical \nnurse coordinator, Health Care Case Managers (nurses) and staff assistants based on the \nprojected number of children in out-of-home placement.  A regional nurse administrator \nsupervises local units for a particular region (aligned with the Area Offices).  DCF worked with \nUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey’s School of Nursing’s François-Xavier \nBagnoud Center (FXB)140 and CP&P Local Offices to build these units.  As part of their duties, \nthese staff members are responsible for tracking and advocating for the health needs of children \nwho enter into out-of-home care.  Since the creation of health care units and assignment of \nnurses to children in out-of-home care, DCF has achieved and sustained substantial results.   \n \nThe Child Health Units are operational in all CP&P Local Offices.  Staffing levels remain \nconsistent.  As of December 31, 2013, there were 163 Health Care Case Managers and 103 staff \nassistants statewide.  DCF works to ensure that the ratio of Health Care Case Managers to \nchildren in out-of-home care is 1 to 50 in every Local Office.   \n \n \nB.  Health Care Performance Measures \n \n \nPre-Placement Medical Assessment \n \n39. Pre-Placement Medical Assessment:  Number/percent of children receiving pre-\nQuantitative or \nplacement medical assessment in a non-emergency room setting or other setting \nQualitative Measure \nappropriate to the situation.141 \nBy December 31, 2009, 98% of children will receive a pre-placement assessment \neither in a non-emergency room setting, or in an emergency room setting if the child \nFinal Target \nneeded emergency medical attention or the child was already in the emergency room \nwhen CP&P received the referral. \n \n   \n                                                 \n140 As of July 1, 2013, the University of Medicine and Dentistry merged with Rutgers, The State University of New \nJersey. The UMDNJ-School of Nursing is now Rutgers School of Nursing. \n141 By agreement of the Parties, this measure has been redrafted to combine the percentage of PPAs in a non-ER \nsetting and those PPAs conducted in an ER that are appropriate based on the presenting medical needs of the \nchild/youth or because the child/youth was already in the ER when CP&P received the referral.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Child Health Unit nurses, clinics and sometimes the child’s own pediatrician provide \nthese assessments. \n \nFrom April to December 2013, 4,014 children entered out-of-home placement and 4,000 \n(100%)142 of them received a pre-placement assessment (PPA).  Of those 4,000 children, 3,378 \n(84%) received the PPA in a non-emergency room setting.  Six hundred and twenty-two children \nreceived a PPA in an emergency room setting. During this period, DCF conducted an internal \nreview of all 622 PPAs that occurred in an emergency room and determined that 605 were \nappropriate for the situation; that is, the child needed emergency medical attention or the child \nwas already in the emergency room when CP&P received the referral.143  Thus, 99 percent of \nchildren received a PPA in a setting appropriate to the situation—84 percent received PPAs in a \n                                                 \n142 Percentage is 100 due to rounding. \n143 In monitoring Period XII, the Monitor reviewed back-up data provided by DCF regarding the PPAs occurring in \nan emergency room setting and agreed with DCF determinations regarding appropriate or inappropriate use of the \nER for PPAs.  In addition, the Monitor’s previous Health Care Case Record Review found that many of the PPAs \noccurring in an ER were because the child had an injury requiring ER treatment or had been brought to the ER by \nthe police or other service provider. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

A CME involves a \ncomprehensive physical, including a developmental history and evaluation, and an initial mental \nhealth screening.145  Mental health screenings determine if a child has a suspected mental health \nneed.146 If a child is suspected to have a mental health need, a full mental health evaluation is \nthen expected to be conducted.  \n \nDCF sustained performance ensuring that 85 percent of children received a CME within the first \n30 days of placement and 98 percent of children received a CME within the first 60 days. \n \n                                                 \n145Another type of CME is the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for Children (CHEC) model which requires a three \npart examination: medical, neurodevelopmental and mental health assessments and can only be administered by a \nlimited number of medical providers in New Jersey.     \n146 In addition to the expectation that mental health screenings occur as part of the CME, DCF directs Health Care \nCase Managers to conduct mental health screenings with children in out-of-home placements who are age two and \nabove and not already receiving mental health services.  Health Care Case Managers conduct these screenings \nwithin the first two weeks of a child’s placement.     \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Similarly, 92 percent of children age two and above \nalso received the required EPSDT well-child examinations (see Figure 45 and Table 22).  This \nperformance is similar to previous monitoring periods and is below the MSA final target of 98 \npercent of children in care for one year or more receiving timely EPSDT well-child \nexaminations.147  However, in the Monitor’s judgment, this performance demonstrates sustained \naccess to health care for children in out-of-home care.  \n \nNJ SPIRIT and SafeMeasures provide reports on when a child receives an EPSDT examination, \nbut neither have the ability to determine whether or not a child is clinically up-to-date with these \nexams. A child may be noted in NJ SPIRIT as not up-to-date if at the EPSDT visit the child was \nsick (children must be well for such visits to be considered EPSDT visits) or the visit was \nmissed, but rescheduled within a close time period.  Also, especially notable for younger \nchildren, once a child is off schedule, they will remain off schedule within DCF’s data system for \nall subsequent EPSDT exams.  Therefore, in an effort to determine the actual receipt of an \nEPSDT exam, DCF conducted a secondary review of all the records of children noted as “not \n                                                 \n147 As the measure involves children in out-of-home placement for one year or more, performance for children under \nthe age of 12 months is not measured by the Monitor. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

DCF’s performance remains similar to the previous three monitoring periods and is \nbelow the final target by five percent.  The dental care measure includes targets for annual and \nsemi-annual dental exams.  Because the performance expectation for field staff is to ensure that \nchildren age three or older receive semi-annual dental exams, DCF had been solely measuring \nwhether children receive dental exams semi-annually.  DCF also provided annual data on this \nmeasure which show that 98 percent of children three and older in care for at least six months in \ncalendar year 2013 had an annual dental exam as of December 31, 2013.  Thus the Monitor \nconsiders DCF to have partially fulfilled this Performance Measure.  \n  \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Based on multiple \nassessments by the Monitor of DCF’s Health Care Case Record review and the results of the \nstatewide Qualitative Review, the Monitor believes that the medical follow-up care and \ntreatment of children is accurately measured through DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record \nreview.149   \n \nDCF reports that of those children identified as needing follow-up care after their CME, 95 \npercent received the recommended follow-up care. As stated previously, mental health \nscreenings are not routinely documented as part of the CME, but Health Care Case Managers \nhelp to ensure that children in out-of-home placement receive needed mental health services.  \nTherefore, the Monitor considers these follow-up care data with the caveat that mental health \nneeds requiring follow-up may not have been fully identified or documented as part of the CME \nfor some children.150 \n \n \nTable 23:  Provision of Required Follow-up Medical Care \n(n=366) \nDecember 31, 2013 \n  \n            #          % \nNo CME data in record  1  >1% \nCME Records  365  100% \n     \nNo follow-up care needed  23  6% \nFollow-up care required  342  94% \n  Received follow-up  326  95% \n  No evidence in record  16  5% \nSource:  DCF, Health Care Case Record Review, Child Health Unit151 \n  \n \n   \n                                                 \n149 The Monitor did not independently verify the findings of DCF’s Health Care Case Record Review during this \nMonitoring Period.

The Review examined \nrecords of a random sample of children in CP&P out-of-home placement who were removed between November 1, \n2012 and July 31, 2013 and were in care for a minimum of 60 days. 2,997 children comprise this cohort and a \nsample of 366 children was reviewed.

The Review examined \nrecords of a random sample of children in CP&P out-of-home placement who were removed between November 1, \n2012 and July 31, 2013 and were in care for a minimum of 60 days. 2,997 children comprise this cohort and a \nsample of 366 children was reviewed. The results have a ± 5 percent margin of error with a 95 percent confidence. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 132 \n\n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nUnder the MSA, all children entering out-of-home care are to have a Health Passport created for \nthem (Section II.F.8).  This Health Passport records all relevant health history and current health \nstatus of the child and is expected to be regularly updated and made available to resource \nparents, children (if old enough) and their parents.   \n \nBased on DCF’s internal Health Care Case Record Review of 366 cases, there is evidence that \nHealth Passports are shared with the child’s caregiver within the first five days of placement in \n65 percent of cases (see Table 24).  This performance does not meet the final performance target.  \nHowever, within 30 days of the placement, DCF data show the Health Passport has been shared \nwith 98 percent of caregivers, consistent with performance from the last two monitoring period.   \n \nThe Health Passport organizes health information from a range of sources including any findings \nof the PPA.  DCF policy requires that the Health Care Case Manager complete the Health \nPassport, which is maintained by the CP&P Local Office Child Health Unit, and provide it to the \nresource parent within 72 hours of the child’s placement.  This is a more stringent policy than the \nMSA requirement that the Health Passport be conveyed to the child’s caregiver within five days.  \nDCF continues to be unable to consistently meet its internal timeframe or the five day \nrequirement set in the MSA, and there is concern that Health Passports produced within 72 \nhours, or even five days, frequently cannot contain meaningful medical information.  The \nMonitor and parties have met to discuss this measure and consider whether a more effective \nmeasure can be designed that assesses how and in what timeframes meaningful medical \ninformation about children can reasonably be collected and timely shared with their caregivers.  \nNo agreement has been reached as of this time.  \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 133 \n\n \n \nX.  MENTAL HEALTH CARE \n \nDCF continues to work on improving its mental health delivery system by expanding the \nservices and supports under the Division of Children’s System of Care.  DCF also has \nmaintained achievement of MSA Performance Measures requiring that children receive timely \nmental health assessments and children and youth received appropriate, evidence-based mental \nhealth services to prevent their entry into CP&P custody. \n \nA.  Mental Health Delivery System \n \nDCF’s Division of Children's System of Care (CSOC) serves children and adolescents with \nemotional, behavioral health, developmental and intellectual disabilities and co-occurring \nconditions.  Beginning in 2012, the provision of services to children with developmental and \nintellectual disabilities, formerly under the purview of the Department of Human Services \n(DHS), transitioned to CSOC.  \n \nIn October 2012 New Jersey received approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (CMS) for a Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver focused, in part, on increasing supports \nfor children and youth who have a risk of hospital level care (children/youth considered to be \nseriously emotionally disturbed). This waiver has two pilot programs—one that focuses on \nchildren and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder and one that focuses on increasing services \nfor youth with a developmental disability and a behavioral health concern. Some aspects of the \nwaiver were implemented in the summer and fall of 2013.   \n \nThe number of children placed out-of-state for treatment remains low. \n \nDCF is required to minimize the number of children in CP&P custody placed in out-of-state \ncongregate care settings and to work on transitioning these children back to New Jersey (Section \nII.D.2). As of December 2013, there were four youth in out-of-state residential placements. All \nfour youth are in a specialized program for the deaf or hard of hearing.  DCF has worked \ncollaboratively with the state’s Department of Education, primarily with staff of New Jersey’s \nMarie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, to develop an in-state program to provide residential \nmental health treatment for five to eight youth. Program services will be provided by St. Joseph’s \nHospital and Medical Center.  The facility is undergoing updates and renovations and DCF \nhopes to move the youth from out-of-state to the new facility in the summer of 2014 if the \nrenovations have been completed.   \n   \nFigure 51 shows the number of children placed out-of-state from June 2011 to December 2013.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

From April to December \n2013, eight youth in CP&P custody, four females and four males ages 13 to 17, were in juvenile \ndetention awaiting a CSOC placement following disposition of their delinquency case. Two \nyouth transitioned from detention within 15 days after disposition.

For the last quarter of the \nmonitoring period, each program’s average census was 76 percent of the program’s capacity.  \nTwo FFT programs operated above capacity.  MST continues to be available in three counties: \nCamden, Essex and Hudson. The MST provider for Essex and Hudson counties operated well \nbelow capacity (averaging 33% monthly census) due to the departure of a number of therapists.   \n \nThe FFT and MST programs averaged approximately 22 successful discharges per month during \nthe last quarter (October-December 2013) of this monitoring period.   \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SERVICES TO PREVENT ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE AND TO SUPPORT \nREUNIFICATION AND PERMANENCY \n \n \nContinued Support for Family Success Centers \n \nQuantitative or  48. Continued Support for Family Success Centers: DCF shall continue to support a \nQualitative Measure  statewide network of Family Success Centers. \nFinal Target  Ongoing Monitoring of Compliance \n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nNew Jersey began developing a network of Family Success Centers (FSCs) in 2007, initially \nwith 21 centers.  Now, in its sixth year, New Jersey has a total of 51 FSCs, at least one in each of \nthe 21 counties.157   \n \nFSCs are neighborhood-based places where any community resident can access family support, \ninformation and services, and specialized supports that tend to vary depending on the needs and \ndesires of the community in which they are located. Their function is to provide resources and \nsupports before families fall into crisis.  FSCs are situated in many types of settings: storefronts, \nhouses, schools, houses of worship and public housing. Services range from life skills training, \nparent and child activities, advocacy, parent education and housing related activities.   \n \nSince Superstorm Sandy in October 2012, New Jersey’s FSCs have become gateways to reach \nfamilies in the counties that were hit the hardest by the storm. In addition to providing families \nwith assistance immediately following the storm, the FSCs offer day to day support and a place \nto build and restore community. \n \nIn September 2013, the Office of Family Support Services (OFSS) redefined the FSC’s \ncontracted services; “parent education” and “parent/child activity” were collapsed into one \nservice and “home visiting” was removed from a contracted service to an expanded service that \neach FSC can choose to provide depending on need. Table 27 shows the unduplicated number of \nfamilies served by New Jersey’s FSCs from April to December 2013.  Table 28 shows the ten \ncontracted services provided by FSCs statewide to individuals, families or groups between April \nand August 2013.158 Table 29 shows the revised contracted services provided by FSCs statewide \nto individuals, families or groups between September and December 2013.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n157 During the monitoring period the new Meadowlands FSC replaced a FSC in Lodi that closed, the Palisades FSC \nreplaced the West Hudson FSC, and the Bayshore FSC was added after a privately funded FSC closed in Essex \ncounty. \n158 Families can receive more than one service at any one time. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SERVICES TO OLDER YOUTH \n \nDuring Phase I of the MSA, DCF created and promoted policies to provide continued support \nand services to youth aged 18 to 21, including extending the option for CP&P custody until age \n21.  During this monitoring period, DCF has continued to expand and deepen its policies and \npractices to support adolescents.  DCF increased attention to permanency for older youth through \nthe implementation of Permanency Roundtables, reorganized Youth Advisory Boards and \nawarded new contracts to support homeless youth and youth who are the victims of human \ntrafficking.  Also, new this monitoring period, DCF was awarded a federal planning grant to \nconduct data analysis and a needs assessment and develop a framework for improving \neducational, employment, well-being and permanency outcomes for CP&P involved youth. \nThese new developments are discussed below. \n \nAlso, discussed below are new developments and updates to current practices and strategies \nutilized by DCF to provide services for older youth in the following areas: housing, education, \nemployment, financial literacy, increasing staff skills and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, \nQuestioning or Intersex (LGBTQI) services.  Following the practice updates, progress toward the \nPhase II Performance Measures is provided.   \n \nA.  New Developments \n \nIn this monitoring period, DCF awarded two contracts that focused on: preventing human \ntrafficking; providing rescue interventions in cases of human trafficking of youth; providing \nstabilization, resources and supportive services needed by these youth; and preparing youth for \nindependence. These contracts were awarded to Homeless Youth Outreach Programs in \ndesignated hurricane impacted counties.  In addition to these efforts, DCF regularly and widely \ndistributed a newsletter to educate all staff about information, tips and resources related to \nhuman trafficking. In August 2013, DCF hired a new staff member within OAS to manage \nefforts on addressing human trafficking case practice issues as well as immigration and \nexpungement of juvenile records.   \n \nDCF also made efforts to enhance supports for youth involved with Youth Advisory Boards \n(YAB).  DCF released a Request for Proposals in May 2013 to support a new Youth Advisory \nBoard model.  Rutgers University School of Social Work was awarded the contract and will be \ncreating 15 YABs statewide as well as one Youth Advisory Council.  By September 2013, the \nexisting YABs had been recognized for their accomplishments and notified of the transition. \nSince then, the Transitions for Youth (TFY) at Rutgers School of Social Work hired staff and \nbuilt much of the infrastructure to support these boards.  The majority of new YABs had their \nfirst meetings in mid-January 2014. \n \nWith support from Casey Family Programs, CP&P and OAS launched Permanency Roundtables \n(PRT) Case Consultation in November 2013.  The PRT began with a kickoff event emphasizing \nthe value of permanency of older youth.  In November, 40 cases statewide were reviewed by five \nteams.  These cases involved youth between the ages of 14 and 17 who had been in care for 50 \nmonths or more with a current case goal of independent living, other long term specialized care, \nkinship legal guardianship or individual stabilization.  During the PRT, teams created a \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 142 \n\n \n \nPermanency Action Plan and 28 of those plans recommended goals of adoption, reunification or \nkinship legal guardianship.  DCF intends to create a tracking process to measure progress \ntowards these recommended goals.  \n \nOn September 26, 2013, the Administration for Children, Youth and Families awarded DCF a \ntwo year planning grant to gather and analyze data and develop an intervention framework that \nwill improve educational, employment, permanency and well-being outcomes for older youth \ninvolved with CP&P. The intervention framework will be evidence-based and focus on \naddressing trauma, improving protective and promotive capacities and comprehensive life skills \nof older youth. \n \nFinally, this monitoring period, OAS began working with the Office of Child and Family Health \nto provide information to youth and providers on the extension of Medicaid coverage for eligible \nyouth until the age of 26 pursuant to the Federal Affordable Care Act. In preparation for the \nJanuary 1, 2014 implementation date, DCF created system changes and processes to identify and \nlink coverage for youth within the 18 to 26 year old population who are determined eligible.  \nPrior to implementation of the new Medicaid coverage extension, during CY 2013, DCF has \ncontinued to ensure that the majority of youth exiting care who need Medicaid health \ninsurance160 receive it.  Specifically, in CY 2013, of the 375 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 who were \ndischarged from placement and needed Medicaid, 353 (94%) received Medicaid for at least one \nmonth following discharge.  Additionally, of the 249 youth ages 17.9 to 20.9 who were \ndischarged from placement between October 1, 2012 and June 31, 2013 and who needed \nMedicaid, 231 (93%) received Medicaid for at least six months.   \n \nB.  Updates to Current Practices \n \nHousing  \n \nThe OAS partners with PerformCare to maintain and operate the Adolescent Housing Hub, a \nreal-time, automated housing slot tracking and referral system housed within PerformCare’s \nCYBER system.  DCF reports that the Hub allows for the identification of appropriate housing \nfor youth by accurately matching the youth’s needs, provider information and program capacity.  \nOAS is assessing data to determine housing needs across the state and is currently in the process \nof removing youth from the Hub who no longer have a need for housing or who have aged out.  \nDCF reports having a total of 371 housing slots for homeless youth and DCF involved youth \nages 16 to 21.  From October 2012 through October 2013, DCF reports a total of 2,867 calls to \nthe Hub for housing assistance, with the highest number of calls occurring in the summer months \nof May through August. The Hub also allows OAS to gather information on youth’s housing, \nemployment and educational status at admission and discharge.  \nDCF continues to support transitional and supported housing for older youth. As indicated in \nTable 30, as of December 31, 2013, there were 390 transitional and supported housing \noperational units contracted for, with 385 slots in use.  In September 2013, DCF funded a new \n                                                 \n160 This includes Chafee Medicaid, CP&P Medicaid or non-CP&P Medicaid.  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Christie  Page 144 \n\n \n \nEducation \n \nThe Office of Educational Support (OESP) moved under the OAS on July 1, 2013.  OESP \nprovides a number of supports to DCF staff, including, for example: \n \n  piloting a training for Educational Stability Liaisons; \n  holding an education workshop for resource parents and DCF workers about supporting \nyouth’s engagement and progression in their education; and \n  supporting CP&P case managers on their individual cases to ensure that youth are on \ntarget to graduate and get the education supports they may need. \n \nOESP also oversees the New Jersey Foster Care (NJFC) Scholars Program, which provides \nassistance with tuition and fees to current and former eligible foster youth in order to pursue \npost-secondary education.  Foster and Adoptive Family Services (FAFS) administers the NJ \nScholars program. For the 2012-2013 academic year ending in June 2013, 327 students \nparticipated in the Scholars program and 274 (84%) received funding through Education and \nTraining Voucher (ETV) or tuition waiver.  DCF reports the remaining youth did not utilize \nScholars program funding because the financial aid provided by their educational institutions \ncovered their expenses.  For the 2013-2014 academic year, 312 youth participated in the Scholars \nprogram and 223 (72%) received funding or tuition waiver. The number of youth enrolled in the \nScholars program has remained steady since the 2011-2012 academic year when 316 students \nparticipated. \n \nDCF continues to make efforts to increase participation in the Scholars program. Between April \nand June 2013, 25 outreach efforts occurred to provide assistance to 111 youth in understanding \nthe Scholars program.  Additional outreach efforts throughout the monitoring period included: \ntwo trainings for CASA volunteers in Mercer and Burlington counties on the Scholars Program, \nfour events with Rutgers Transitions for Youth Summer Housing and Internship program to \nassist Scholars in completing 2013-2014 Scholars Program applications, and presentations at two \n“Aging Out” events that reached approximately 42 youth.    \n \nDCF reports that all youth enrolled in the Scholars program receive support services through \nProject MYSELF.  These services are designed to improve the youth’s academic performance, \nincrease post-secondary education retention and develop essential life skills and competencies. A \nsupport coach works with each student involved with Project MYSELF to provide mentoring, \ncrisis intervention, and referrals to academic community and other resources as needed, with \nmore intensive involvement from the coach for those students with a low grade point average.161  \n \nThe OESP also provides Ward of the Court letters for youth who were in foster care with CP&P \nafter the age of 13.  These letters allow the adolescent to file as an independent student on the \nFAFSA and thus the youth does not have to provide their parents/ tax information for financial \naid eligibility review. The OESP provided these letters for 73 students during this monitoring \nperiod. \n                                                 \n161 DCF reports that in the 2012-2013 academic year, Project MYSELF served 321 students and of those, 191 \nreceived the more intensive support coach contact. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 145 \n\n \n \nEmployment  \n \nOAS is working with the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development and the \nState Employment and Training Commission (SETC) to identify, evaluate and expand access to \nemployment programs.  One component of this partnership includes resource and information \nsharing with One-Stop Career Centers, Workforce Investment Boards and Youth Investment \nCouncils throughout the state.  Another component of the partnership is participation in the \nSETC’s Shared Youth Vision Council which brings together stakeholders to construct a shared \nvision to guide employment and training services for youth.  \n \nAlso during this monitoring period, OAS, Casey Family Programs and the Rutgers University \nSchool of Social Work partnered together and strategized about best practices and models used \nby other child welfare systems in supporting youth employment. As a result, OAS in cooperation \nwith these partners and OESP developed and delivered staff training that focused on supporting \nengagement activities with youth to support employment.  Topics included working with youth \non employment planning, career assessment, training, job seeking and retention.   \n \nFinancial literacy  \n \nDCF continues to offer EverFi, an online financial literacy program, to provide services to youth \nin housing and life skills programs.162  As of August 2013, 86 youth were either actively engaged \nin or completed the course.  An unlimited amount of additional slots are available for more youth \nto participate in the future and training is being conducted with CP&P as well as Care \nManagement Organization (CMO) youth serving agencies.   \n \nIncreasing staff skills \n \nBeginning in September 2012, OAS offers quarterly training on adolescent policy, practice and \nresources.  The training is mandatory for adolescent supervisors and workers and other CP&P \nstaff who work with youth are encouraged to attend.  \n \nThe OAS provides a variety of technical assistance to the field on adolescent policy and practice.  \nDuring the monitoring period, OAS hosted regional practice forums for cross agency staff in \nJune, September, and December on topics relevant to adolescent practice.163  Topics included \nMedicaid Extension to age 26, the role out of Youth Advisory Boards, permanency initiatives, \neducational initiatives and employment practices.  In addition, these forums provide the \nopportunity for OAS to receive feedback about current policies and new potential initiatives that \nwill improve services, resources and case practice tools. OAS also visits with Outreach to At-\nRisk Youth (OTARY) programs quarterly and provides on-site technical assistance and \nconsultation. Meetings were held in April and August 2013 for the 21 OTARY programs and \ntrainings were provided on youth employment opportunities, housing services, mandatory \nreporting laws, adolescent abuse and neglect, case management and developing youth leadership \n                                                 \n162 EverFi is underwritten by Kearny Federal Savings Bank. \n163 Staff are from CP&P, the DCF Office of Education and the Children’s System of Care Care Management \nOrganizations. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Finally, in August 2013, 28 CP&P staff completed the first year of the Adolescent \nAdvocacy program—a post-B.A. 15 credit certificate through Montclair State University focused \non adolescent advocacy and case practice. Forty new students are now participating in the second \nyear of the program. \n \nServices for LGBTQI Population \n \nThe MSA required DCF to develop and begin to implement a plan for appropriate service \ndelivery to youth who identify as LGBTQI (MSA Section II.C.4).  During this monitoring \nperiod, DCF continued to implement strategies and services to meet the needs of this population.  \nThe primary vehicle for these services is through the Safe Space Program.  This program \nencourages and promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment within DCF for LGBTQI \nyouth, families and staff through training, activities, resources, community partnerships, \ncollection of LGBTQI data and through developing policies that reflect appropriate case practice \nwith this population.  DCF has increased the number of Safe Space liaisons during this \nmonitoring period by adding an additional 12 liaisons, now offering a total of 160 for all 47164 \nCP&P Local Offices.  Liaisons continue to produce LGBTQI inclusive newsletters, make \npresentations on local and national LGBTQI resources, update the LGBTQI Resource Guide, and \ncollect data on the number of LGBTQI youth and families that they serve. The data are collected \nby OAS to identify, create and update policy, programming and practice needs to best support \nthese youth and families. To date, DCF reports that these liaisons provided 351 consultations \nconcerning case practice and community resources related to LGBTQI youth and families.  Also \nduring this monitoring period, the New Jersey Office of Training and Professional Development \nchanged their Cultural Competency I and II trainings to include a focus on LGBTQ issues in the \nworkforce and key concepts on how best to work with LGBTQI youth and families. \n \nC.  Performance Measures Measuring Services to Older Youth \n \nAs of December 31, 2013, CP&P served 2,858 youth aged 18 to 21; current information \nindicates that 520 (18%) youth were living in a CP&P out-of-home placement; 1,633 (57%) \nyouth were living in their own homes;165 and 705 (25%) youth were receiving adoption or \nKinship Legal Guardianship subsidies. \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n164 The Newark Adoption office was phased out as of October 2013 and adoption units were assigned to each Local \nOffice. As of October 2013, there were 46 CP&P offices.   \n165 DCF is further analyzing these data to better understand the exact setting(s) indicated for the youth categorized as \n“living in their own homes.” \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Services to Older Youth:  DCF shall provide services to youth between the ages \nQuantitative or  18 and 21 similar to services previously available to them unless the youth, \nQualitative Measure  having been informed of the implications, formally request that DCF close the \ncase. \nBy December 31, 2011, 90% of youth are receiving acceptable services as measured \nFinal Target \nby the QR. \n \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nPerformance data for this measure were collected through QR reviews conducted between \nJanuary 2012 and July 2013 of 44 cases of youth ages 18 to 21.  The standard NJ protocol was \nutilized and for the 20 reviews conducted in July 2013, reviewers were given a list of additional \nconsiderations to apply in reviewing cases which asked reviewers to consider the youth’s overall \nglobal well-being and functioning taking into consideration, for example, youth who identify as \nLGBTQ, are victims of domestic violence, are pregnant or parenting or are developmentally \ndisabled.  By agreement between the Monitor and CP&P, cases were considered acceptable for \nthis measure if the QR ratings were within the acceptable range (4-6) for both the overall \nChild/Youth and Family Indicator and Practice Performance Indicator.   \n \nTwenty-nine (66%) of the 44 cases reviewed were rated acceptable on both the Child/Youth and \nFamily Indicator and Practice Performance Indicator.  This is the first time performance data has \nbeen available on this measure and findings from these reviews identify areas of strength to build \nupon as well as areas needing improvement to support provision of services to older youth.   \n \nBelow are QR indicators within each overall domain where acceptable ratings were provided by \nreviewers for the majority of cases: \n  Safety of the youth in their home setting (98% acceptable), \n  Safety of the youth in other settings (98% acceptable),  \n  Living arrangement (98% acceptable), \n  Physical health of the youth (93% acceptable), \n  Emotional well-being (82% acceptable), \n  Learning and development (87% acceptable), \n  Provision of health care services (91% acceptable) and  \n  Resource availability (93% acceptable).   \n \nOverall acceptable ratings for the following QR indicators identify areas needing improvement:  \n  Progress toward permanency (68% acceptable), \n  Family teamwork – formation (57% acceptable), \n  Family teamwork – functioning (52% acceptable), \n  Case planning process (66% acceptable), \n  Plan implementation (66% acceptable), \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 149 \n\n \n \n  Long term view (57% acceptable) and \n  Transitions and life adjustments (55% acceptable).   \n \nDCF has analyzed the data collected through these reviews and is in the process of compiling a \nreport with further detail of the findings.  Data will continue to be collected during scheduled \nQRs of older youth moving forward and will be compiled and presented for this performance \nmeasure in future reports.   \n \nYouth Exiting Care \n \nQuantitative or  55.  Youth Exiting Care:  Youth exiting care without achieving permanency shall \nQualitative Measure  have housing and be employed or in training or an educational program. \nBy December 31, 2011, 95% of youth exiting care without achieving permanency \nFinal Target \nshall have housing and be employed or in training or an educational program. \n \n \nFigure 54: Youth Exiting Care with Housing and Employed or Enrolled in Educational  \nor Vocational Training Program \nJanuary 2010 – December 2013 \n \n100%\nFinal Target (95%) \n93%\n80% 86%\n72%\n60% 65%\n60%\n52%\n40%\n20%\nJan-Jun 2010\nJan-Jun2010                       Jul-Dec 2012                       Jan-Dec-2013\nHousing Employed or Educational/Vocational Training Program  \nSource: Data from DCF and CSSP Case Record Reviews  \n \nPerformance as of December 31, 2013: \n \nThe Monitor and DCF conducted a case record review of the 106 youth who exited care without \nachieving permanency between January and December 2013 and found that 93 percent of these \nyouth had documentation of a housing plan upon exiting CP&P care and 65 percent of applicable \nyouth were either employed or enrolled in education or vocational training programs.  Current \nperformance demonstrates an improvement on this measure since the last case record review \nwhich assessed youth who exited care without permanency between July and December 2012.  \nThat review found that 86 percent of those youth had housing and 52 percent were either \nemployed or enrolled in education or vocational training programs. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 150 \n\n \n \nData collected in the current review of youth exiting in 2013 identified the following pertaining \nto planning and service provision:   \n \nPlanning and Assessment:  \n  The reason for case closure for 42 percent of youth reviewed was the youth turned 21 \nyears old and 28 percent of youth reviewed declined further services.    \n  51 percent of youth signed an adolescent closing agreement at the time their case closed.   \n  77 percent of youth had an Independent Living Assessment completed, and of those with \na completed assessment, 54 percent were completed within 12 months of case closure and \n46 percent were completed over 12 months prior to case closure.   \n  All youth (100%) had a case plan.  \n  42 percent of youth had a Transitional Living Plan completed and included in their \nrecord.  \n \nHousing:  \n  All but one youth (99%) had documented housing prior to case closure.   \n  Documentation in the case record indicated that 81 percent of youth had worked with \ntheir caseworker prior to case closure in order to secure housing.  \n  Reviewers were asked to identify strengths and areas needing improvement with DCF’s \ncasework around housing.  Some of the more commonly identified strengths included: \nengagement with youth and family (80 cases), identification of resources and programs \nfor the youth (71 cases) and caseworker-supervisory conferences were held (52 cases). \nAreas needing improvement included: more community resources needed to achieve the \ngoal (35 cases), assessments not completed or only partially completed (36 cases), plans \nnot completed or only partially completed (34 cases) and improvements needed in \ncaseworker-supervisory conferencing (36 cases).  \n \nEducation and Employment:  \n  At the time of case closure, 50 percent of the youth had at least completed a high school \nlevel of education.  \n  87 percent of applicable youth had undergone case planning specific to their educational \nor vocational needs; 77 percent of applicable youth had undergone planning related to \nemployment.   \n  Reviewers were asked to identify strengths and areas needing improvement with DCF’s \ncasework around education and employment.  Some of the more commonly identified \nstrengths included: engagement of youth and family (75 cases), resources and programs \nidentified for the youth (60 cases) and caseworker-supervisory conferences were held (43 \ncases).  Areas needing improvement included: assessments not completed or only \npartially completed (38 cases), plans not completed or only partially completed (38 \ncases), improvements needed in caseworker-supervisory conferencing (35 cases) and \nimproved follow-up by caseworker (35 cases). \n \nCP&P is in the process of finalizing a full report on the findings from this review and the \nMonitor anticipates this will be available on their website in the near future.   \n   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

SUPPORTING A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE:  CASELOADS AND \nTRAINING \n \nDCF continues to meet average office caseload standards for Permanency and Adoption workers, \nand individual caseload standards for IAIU staff and Permanency workers.  DCF has not met \nstandards for office average caseload for Intake workers, and individual caseload standards for \nAdoption and Intake workers, although Intake caseload performance has slightly improved \nduring this monitoring period.   \n \nA.  Caseloads \n \nCaseload compliance is measured by individual caseworker caseloads in each of the functional \nareas (Intake, Permanency, Adoption and IAIU) as well as office standards for CP&P Local \nOffices. Office-wide average caseloads are to comply with the applicable functional area \ncaseload standards in 95 percent of all CP&P Local Offices and at least 95 percent of workers in \neach of the functional areas are to have individual caseloads meeting the designated standard \n(MSA Section III.B.1).

Christie  Page 152 \n\n \n \nInterview Procedure to Verify Worker Caseloads \n \nThe Monitor verified caseload data supplied by DCF by conducting telephone interviews with \nrandomly selected workers across the state.  One-hundred sixty workers were selected from those \nactive in September 2013.  All of the 46 CP&P167 Local Offices were represented in the sample.  \nThe interviews were conducted throughout the months of November and December 2013 and \nJanuary 2014.  All 160 workers were called.  Information was collected from 125 workers (82% \nof the eligible sample), located in all 46 Local Offices.  Five workers were no longer employed \nby CP&P or were on extended leave during the period of the calls and were removed from the \nsample. One caseworker declined to participate and another was an interim supervisor who did \nnot carry a caseload for a large portion of the monitoring period (April through July 2013) were \nalso removed from the sample.

The state reported an average of 946 active Intake workers between April and December \n2013. Among those active Intake workers, an average of 823 (87%) workers had caseloads that \nmet the caseload requirements.  Specifically in December 2013, individual worker caseload \ncompliance for Intake workers was also 87 percent. For the 122 Intake workers who did not meet \ncaseload requirements in December 2013, the highest number of new intakes during the month \nfor any worker was 9 and the highest number of open cases for any worker in the month was 25 \nfamilies.   \n \nData by Local Office show that during December 2013, performance ranged between 19 percent \nand 100 percent, with 24 of 46 (52%) Local Offices having all Intake workers with caseloads in \ncompliance (see Appendix D-1). \n \nAmong the 125 workers who participated in the phone interview for caseload verification, 57 \nwere Intake workers.

As of \nDecember 31, 2013, 13 RWP workers were hired, trained and assigned to Superstorm impacted \ncounties, ten of whom were assigned caseloads while the remaining three await assignment. \nImpact teams consist of a supervisor, and three workers that can be assigned to a unit or an office \nthroughout the state where Intakes are unusually high and assist in maintaining caseload \nstandards by taking any overflow of investigations.  There are ten impact teams, one per Area \nOffice.  \n \n \nFigure 58:  Percentage of Intake Workers with Individual Caseloads \nat or Below the Applicable Individual Caseload Standards \n (June 2009 – December 2013)* \n \n100%\nh  Final Target (95%) \nwit 90%\nkers ads 91% 87% 86% 87%\nWorelo 80% 84%\nw\nake Cas 78% 76% 76% 76%\nntage of IntIndividual  6700%%\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP 50%\nJuJnu-n0-909    DDeecc--0099         JJuunn--1100        D Dece-c1-010      JJuunn--1111        DDeecc--1111       JJuunn--1122       MDeacr--1123     DeJucn-1-133\nMonth\nSource:  DCF data \n*The performance percentage shown on the last month of each monitoring period (June and December) is the \naverage of the prior six month’s performance in meeting individual caseload standards during that six month \nmonitoring period.

Christie  Page 156 \n\n \n \nWorkers Report “Shared” Cases as a Common Occurrence \n \nAs described in the Period XIII monitoring report, Intake and Permanency workers sometimes \nshare responsibility for families with open permanency cases where there are new allegations of \nabuse or neglect. According to DCF procedure, all CPS Family Reports and CWS Family \nReferrals are assigned to Intake workers to investigate and these reports are reflected in caseload \nreporting as one of the eight referrals in the month of the report and as one of the Intake worker’s \n12 open families for that month. However, when circumstances indicate that a family with an \nalready open permanency case is the subject of a new CPS Family report, the work with the \nfamily becomes the shared responsibility of both Intake and Permanency workers until the \ninvestigation is completed.   \n \nIntake workers are assigned a secondary worker designation in NJ SPIRIT on a shared case for a \nfamily who had been previously assigned to a Permanency worker. According to DCF, this \narrangement emphasizes the primary role of the Permanency worker in securing placement, \nfacilitating visits, supporting the family to implement the case plan and coordinating services. It \nalso reflects the Permanency worker’s responsibility to provide information to the Intake worker \nand to link the family to appropriate services and supports identified during the course of the new \ninvestigation, thus relieving the Intake worker of the case management responsibility for the \ncase.  Intake workers continue to be responsible for the work required to complete investigative \ntasks and to reach and document an investigative finding.  The designation as a secondary \nworker is not reflected as an open family for the Intake worker’s caseload and is not categorized \nas an open family in monthly caseload reports.  Thus, these secondary assignments are counted \nas one of the Intake workers’ eight new referrals assigned in a month, but are not counted as part \nof their 12 open families in a month.  \n \nDCF reports that Intake supervisors in CP&P Local Offices are expected to appropriately \nmanage the workload of staff in their units and consider an Intake worker’s primary and \nsecondary responsibilities when assigning new referrals.  The following table provides the \nreported number of secondary assignments to Intake workers by month for this monitoring \nperiod.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Specifically, in the month \nof December 2013, 291 (30%) Intake workers received two or more secondary assignments.  Of \nthose 291 workers, 202 (69%) had a total of 12 open families or less for the month, including \ntheir secondary case assignments.   \n \n \nDuring phone interviews with caseworkers, the Monitor inquired about the prevalence of \nsecondary assignments and their impact on a worker’s workload. Intake workers were asked how \nprevalent secondary assignments are, what effect these assignments have on their workload and \nhow they are measured.  Of the 57 Intake workers interviewed, 55 (97%) reported receiving an \nassignment to investigate a new report on an open permanency case as a secondary worker at \nleast once in the six month period between April and September 2013 and 23 (40%) reported \nreceiving at least one secondary assignment per month. Forty-eight of the 57 (84%) Intake \nworkers confirmed that their supervisor appropriately counts secondary assignments toward their \neight new referrals for the month.  Thirty-three of the 57 (58%) Intake workers interviewed \nresponded that in their opinion, the workload for an investigation on an open Permanency case in \nwhich they are designated as secondary is equivalent to, or sometimes more than, the \nworkload for an initial investigation. Workers explained that although Permanency workers may \nhave completed collateral contacts or are able to provide information about the family’s \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 158 \n\n \n \ncircumstances, every investigation must be approached in the same manner regardless of primary \nor secondary status.  \n \nIn response to these findings, DCF conducted an analysis regarding the prevalence and \ndistribution of secondary assignments and potential workload implications.  DCF found that \npractice related to the division of labor between the Intake and Permanency workers for shared \ncases varied considerably across the state.  Consequently, DCF issued a policy, effective April 7, \n2014 further clarifying the division of responsibilities between Intake and Permanency workers \nupon receipt of a new allegation of abuse or neglect involving a family with an open permanency \ncase. The new policy makes clear that the Permanency worker is responsible for all non-\ninvestigative duties, including securing a placement setting, coordination of services, visits with \nand between parents and children and coordination of medical care168.   \n \nDCF’s internal review led leadership to conclude that the vast majority of Intake workers have \none or two secondary assignments in any given month, and the variation in workload associated \nwith any investigation needs to be managed by supervisors at the local level to ensure a balanced \nworkload for each Intake worker. DCF has agreed to further examine the process by which \nsecondary assignments are generated, as well as workflow management practices across Local \nOffices to ensure that intake workload is appropriately managed regardless of the combination of \nprimary and secondary assignments.  \n \nPlaintiffs and DCF have expressed to the Monitor different opinions about how secondary \nassignments should be counted in assessing caseload compliance. DCF’s view is that secondary \nassignments should continue to be reflected as one of an Intake worker’s eight new referrals each \nmonth but should not be counted as part of an Intake worker’s caseload of 12 open families per \nmonth.  Plaintiffs have asked that all new referrals are included in both parts of an Intake \nworker’s caseload count.  \n \nThe Monitor will continue to track the incidence of secondary assignments to Intake workers and \ncontinue its work to determine whether the impact a shared case on the Intake worker’s workload \nis significant.  The Monitor will also examine whether the new policy has helped to clarify the \ndivision of labor for secondary assignments between Intake and Permanency workers. DCF has \nidentified Local Offices struggling with intake caseload compliance generally, some of which \nmay also be managing a high number of secondary assignments. They will be focusing their \nefforts in supporting these offices. The Monitor will specifically track outcomes for these offices \nand will also look at this issue in greater depth as part of an upcoming case record review that \nDCF and the Monitor will conduct on the quality of investigative practice.   \n \n   \n                                                 \n168 CP&P (4-7-2014).

The Monitor’s review of DCF data found that two \npercent of investigations were assigned to non-caseload carrying staff between the months of \nSeptember through December 2013.  DCF reports that their policy requires completion of First \nResponder training for all staff prior to intake assignment and that non-caseload carrying staff \nwho are assigned investigations have been trained and receive supervision by the Intake \nsupervisor as they carry out these investigations.  \n \nAs part of the interviews discussed above, Intake workers were asked if there were scenarios in \ntheir office in which non-caseload carrying staff could be assigned an investigation. Twenty-two \nof the 57 workers (39%) reported that there are scenarios in which this takes place.  Respondents \nstated that non-caseload carrying staff with prior investigations experience can be assigned cases \nwhen all Intake workers in a Local Office reach their assignment limit for the month.  This was \nthe most common scenario described.  The most frequently identified job titles for the non-\ncaseload carrying staff who are assigned investigations are Administrative Assistant, Case \nPractice Specialist, Litigation Specialists and Resource Development Specialists.  \n  \nInstitutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU) \n \nAs of December 31, 2013 the individual worker caseload standard for IAIU investigators of no \nmore than 12 open cases at any one time and no more than eight new referrals assigned in a \nmonth was met: DCF data show 100 percent compliance with the standard for IAIU caseloads. \n                                                 \n169 Data are provided for investigations assigned within five days of intake receipt date and does not reflect \nadditional assignments to an investigation after those first five days. DCF conducted a review of assignments to non-\ncaseload carrying staff in NJ SPIRIT and found that some investigations had been re-assigned to caseload carrying \nworkers after the initial five days.  As a result, there is potential for the percentage of investigations assigned to non-\ncaseload carrying staff to be lower than 1%.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

CP&P trained 122 \nworkers during this monitoring period, 106 of whom were hired in the previous monitoring \nperiod. Twenty-five of the 122 workers were trained through the Baccalaureate Child Welfare \nEducation Program (BCWEP).172 \n \nThe Monitor verified that the state complied with the MSA (Section II.B.1.b).  \n \nCase Practice Model Training \n \nDCF continues to train its workforce on the Case Practice Model (CPM), which represents the \nfundamental change in practice in New Jersey.  At this stage in the implementation of the CPM, \nthe only staff who receive CPM training are staff who did not receive CPM training at an earlier \ndate because they were not yet on staff, were on leave when the training was conducted, or not \nyet appointed as supervisors in the case of Module 6. \n \nAs reflected in Table 35, between April and December 2013, the New Jersey Office of Training \nand Special Development (Training Academy) trained 225 staff on Module 1 of the CPM.  The \nTraining Academy also trained 215 staff on Module 2.  These are the first two training modules \nin the six part series. \n \nModules 3 through 6 of the series take place on site in CP&P Local Offices and is conducted by \nthe New Jersey Child Welfare Training Partnership. 173 Between April and December 2013, 256 \nstaff were trained in Module 3, 200 were trained in Module 4 and 196 were trained in Module 5. \nA total of seven staff were trained in Module 6.174  \n \nThe Monitor verified that staff took Case Practice Model training and passed competency exams. \n \n   \n                                                 \n172 BCWEP is a consortium of seven New Jersey colleges (Rutgers University, Seton Hall University, Stockton \nCollege, Georgian Court University, Monmouth University, Kean University and Ramapo College) that enables \nstudents to earn the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree.

Christie – July 1, \n2008 through December 31, 2008, Washington, D.C., pg. 34, the Monitor previously determined that this course of \nstudy together with Worker Readiness Training designed by the DCF Child Welfare Training Academy satisfies the \nMSA requirements. All BCWEP students are required to pass the same competency exams that non-BCWEP \nstudents take before they are permitted to carry a caseload. \n173 The New Jersey Child Welfare Training Partnership is a consortium of three New Jersey colleges and universities \n(Rutgers School of Social Work, Montclair State University Center for Child Advocacy and the Richard Stockton \nCollege of New Jersey) that DCF contracts with to provide In-Service training to CP&P staff.  \n174 Seven staff took Module 6 either as make-ups or because they were newly appointed supervisors.  \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH QUALITATIVE REVIEW AND THE \nPRODUCTION AND USE OF ACCURATE DATA  \n \nQUALITATIVE REVIEW \n \nDCF’s Office of Performance Management and Accountability continues to facilitate statewide \nQualitative Reviews (QRs), led by the Office of Quality.  During this monitoring period, DCF \nreviewed 133 cases from eleven counties,177 typically reviewing 12 cases from each county.  The \nreviews focus on the status of children, the status of practice and the functioning of systems in \neach of the counties. For children under 18, the child’s legal guardian is asked to give informed \nconsent for participation in the QR.  Trained review teams of two persons that include DCF staff, \ncommunity stakeholders and Monitor staff review CP&P case records and interview as many \npeople as possible who are involved with the child and family.  Following the QR in each \ncounty, areas of accomplishment and challenges for the system are identified and discussed to \ninform continued case practice improvement. Selected QR results are also used to report on \nseveral MSA requirements and are included in this report.  \n \nOf the 133 children whose cases were reviewed between April and December 2013, 66 were \nmale and 67 were female. They ranged in age from less than one year old to 20 years old, with \nthe majority (42%) being infants to four year olds.  Of the remainder, eighteen percent of the \nchildren were five to nine years old, nineteen percent were between ten and 13 years old and \ntwenty-one percent were over age fourteen. Over a third (34%) of the children were living with a \nparent at the time of the review; 66 percent of the children lived with a relative or non-relative \nresource parent, some with the goal of adoption. Table 36 provides the racial demographics of \nthe 133 children reviewed. \n \n \nTable 36:  Qualitative Review Racial Demographics178 \n(April–December 2013) \n \nRace  #   % \nWhite/Caucasian  85  49% \nAfrican American  49  28% \nHispanic  32  19% \nNative Hawaiian  1  <1% \nAmerican Indian  0  0% \nAsian  1  <1% \nUnable to Determine/Unknown  5  3% \nTotal  173  101* \nSource:  DCF, QR Demographics April 2013 – December 2013 \n*Percentage is greater than 100 due to rounding  \n                                                 \n177 Qualitative Reviews were conducted in Union, Warren, Passaic, Monmouth, Gloucester, Cape May, Middlesex, \nCumberland, Sussex, Essex and Camden counties.  \n178 Percentages are calculated from a total of 173; some children are identified by more than one race.   \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie  Page 170 \n\n \n \nDCF reports that across the state, 1,257 people were interviewed to inform the QR data for this \nreporting period.  Those informants included CP&P and Child Health Unit staff, biological \nparents, others who the youth or parent identified as supportive, relative and non-relative \nresource parents, education providers, mental health and legal professionals, substance abuse \ntreatment providers, and children/youth.179  Reviewers evaluated the child and family’s status \nand rated whether the status was acceptable or unacceptable.180  See Table 37 for the results on \neach Child and Family Status indicators and overall Child Status ratings for all cases. \n \nAs shown in Table 37, the current status of children was rated as acceptable in the majority of \ncases in most key areas measured including safety, living arrangement, learning and \ndevelopment and physical health of the child. The QR scores regarding Family Functioning and \nResourcefulness and Progress towards Permanency remain low, indicating a need for attention to \nthese areas of practice.  \n \n \nTable 37:  Qualitative Review Child and Family Status Results \n(April–December 2013) \n \n# Cases  # Cases  % \nChild & Family Status Indicators \nApplicable  Acceptable  Acceptable \nSafety at Home  133  128  96% \nSafety in other Settings  133  130  98% \nStability at Home  133  105  79% \nStability in School  67  57  85% \nLiving Arrangement  88  87  99% \nFamily Functioning & Resourcefulness  127  79  62% \nProgress towards Permanency  133  74  56% \nPhysical Health of the Child  133  129  97% \nEmotional Well-Being  133  112  84% \nLearning & Development, Under  Age 5  58  55  95%  \nLearning & Development, Age 5 & older  52  42  81% \nOVERALL Child & Family  Status  133  120  90% \n Source:  DCF, QR results April 2013 – December 2013 \n                                                 \n179 Interviews are usually conducted individually, either by phone or in person. All efforts are made to see \nchildren/youth in the setting in which they reside. \n180 In previous monitoring reports, under the heading of acceptable, status was further described as either “optimal,” \n“good,” or “fair.” Unacceptable status was further defined as either “marginal,” “poor,” or “worsening.”  Beginning \nthis monitoring period, under the heading of acceptable, status is changed to be further described as either \"refine” \nor “maintain.” Unacceptable status is changed to be further described as either “refine” or “improve.” By agreement \nbetween the Monitor and CP&P, cases were considered acceptable if the QR ratings were within 4 – 6 and \nunacceptable if ratings were within 1 – 3. \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

For \nexample, Family Team formation showed a 13 percent improvement and Family Team \nfunctioning improved by 12 percent from the previous monitoring period.  Following the QR and \nbased on results, each county develops a plan to focus on improving practice in particular areas. \nThe statewide QR process has become a routine part of quality improvement practice in New \nJersey and QR data continue to be used to inform policy and practice changes. \n \nDCF is expected to release its annual report on findings from 2013 QRs in the fall of 2014.   \n \nNJ SPIRIT \n  \nDCF continues to work to improve data entry, data quality and data reporting through NJ \nSPIRIT.  Additionally, DCF continues to fulfill the MSA requirement to produce agency \nperformance reports with a set of measures approved by the Monitor and to post these reports on \nthe DCF website for public viewing (MSA II.J.6).182 \n \nNJ SPIRIT functionality was again enhanced during this monitoring period.  In June 2013, a new \nfeature was added to NJ SPIRIT that provided all field staff responsible for investigating \nallegations the ability to listen to the audio of the report to the SCR.  Additionally, changes were \nmade to NJ SPIRIT requiring that workers complete a family risk re-assessment 30 days before \nclosing an in-home case to reinforce policy.  \n \nThe NJ SPIRIT Help Desk has continued to support workers in resolving issues. Between April \nand December 2013 the Help Desk closed 21,456 tickets requesting help or NJ SPIRIT fixes. \nThe Help Desk resolved 12,659 (59%) of the 21,456 closed tickets within one work day and an \nadditional 5,364 (25%) tickets within seven work days for a total of 84 percent resolved within \nseven work days.   \n \nSafeMeasures \n \nSafeMeasures continues to be used by DCF staff at all levels of the organization to help them \ntrack, monitor and analyze trends in case practice in their own local areas. SafeMeasures allows \nstaff to analyze data by Area Office, county, Local Office, unit supervisor and by case and \nprovides the staff with quantitative data they can use to identify strengths and diagnose needs to \nimprove outcomes.  \n \nDCF continues to work with the Children’s Research Center (CRC) to develop new \nSafeMeasures screens as well as refine reporting data. During this monitoring period, CRC has \nupgraded SafeMeasures application to a new version: version five. This version has more \nfunctionality with customizable views and menus to meet the continuing needs of users.  DCF \nhas seen a sustained increase in SafeMeasures usage by staff.  According to DCF, while this \nincrease occurred among all users, supervisors were the highest group of users followed by \n                                                 \n182 See http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/childdata/  \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET  \n \nDCF’s FY 2014 budget included a supplemental appropriation of $22.3 million of new state \nfunding for the Children’s System of Care (CSOC) and supplemental state funding of $8.2 \nmillion to support adoption subsidies, family support services and independent living programs.  \n \nThe proposed DCF budget for FY 2015, which begins July 1, 2014, remains slightly over a \nbillion dollars ($1.09 billion) in appropriated state funds.  This represents an increase of $2.7 \nmillion more than the adjusted FY 2014 appropriation. The FY 2015 budget provides funds for \n6,643 staff positions which represents no change from FY 2014. \n \nDCF reports that a total of $34.5 million in state funds are invested in DCF services and \nprograms, which includes FY 2014 supplemental resources of $30.6 million as well as FY 2015 \ngrowth of $3.9 million. DCF’s proposed FY 2015 budget also includes a supplemental \nappropriation of $2.1 million of new state funding for CSOC and a supplemental state funding of \n$1.8 million for CP&P programming.  \n \nDCF reports that the proposed budget, if approved by the legislature, provides sufficient \nresources to carry out the state’s commitment to meet all MSA requirements for staffing and \nservice delivery and for the state’s responsibility for child protection, CSOC, services to support \nchildren in their own homes and in out-of-home placement and to achieve safety, permanency \nand well-being outcomes for the children and families it serves.  \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families  July 2014 \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Christie    Appendix B-6 \n\n \nAPPENDIX:  C \nNew Jersey Department of Children and Families \nNeeds Assessment \n \nI.  Overview and Purpose of the Needs Assessment \nAs part of the ongoing requirements under the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA), and as a \nkey component of a learning organization, the NJ Department of Children and Families (DCF) is \ncommitted to understanding the needs and service gaps of those it serves.  Specifically, the MSA \nrequires that: \n \n“The state shall regularly evaluate the need for additional placements and services to meet the \nneeds of children in custody and their families, and to support intact families and prevent the need \nfor out-of-home care. Such needs assessments shall be conducted on an annual, staggered basis \nthat assures that every county is assessed at least once every three years. The state shall develop \nplacements and services consistent with the findings of these needs assessments.”  \n \nWith this in mind, DCF will implement a multi-year needs assessment that focuses on identifying \nthe strengths and needs for children and youth in out of home placement through the Division of \nChild Protection and Permanency (DCP&P) as well as for children at risk of entering out of home \nplacement. DCF proposes that the focus of the DCF Needs Assessment be narrow in scope in order \nto have the ability to delve deeply into areas identified through a mixed-methods approach to \ngathering and assessing information from a variety of sources. This needs assessment will not only \nprovide the data for DCF to understand the needs of children, youth, and families, but will \nprioritize needs for implementing actionable change to enhance the current service array.  Using \ndata to drive the focus of the needs assessment will ensure that the results and recommendations \nare germane to the geographic area and subpopulations subject to the needs assessment. Appendix \nA outlines the timeline for the completion of the multi-year DCF Needs Assessment. \n \nII.  Approach \nUsing a mixed-methods approach of both quantitative and qualitative data, DCF will collaborate \nwith stakeholders including youth in care, families, external providers (i.e. court system, service \nproviders, etc.), other key community informants, and internal staff members to create a responsive \napproach that focuses on the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and youth in out-of-\nhome care and families with children at risk of placement. The goals of this needs assessment are \nto: \n  Identify and prioritize the placement and service needs183 (as identified by the family-\nserving professionals) and the service demands (as identified by families themselves) of \nthe target population;  \n                                                 \n183 DCF recognizes the importance of the family voice in determining their needs and acknowledges that there may \nbe differences between that family voice and the assessment of family needs from the professionals working with \nthe family. Professional assessments for services are needed to account for underlying needs and the presenting \nbehavior. \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-1 \n\n \n  Identify and evaluate the current service array within DCP&P through contracted and \ncommunity based resources focusing on the availability, accessibility, utilization, and \nquality of services;  \n  Identify gaps in services and placement resources needed to support children in out-of-\nhome placement and their families; \n  Partner with external stakeholders to develop targeted, prioritized recommendations based \non the findings of the needs assessment; \n  Provide  recommendations  to  DCF  leadership  to  enhance  and/or  develop  services  to \nimprove the permanency, safety, and well-being of children and youth in out of home \nplacement or at risk of placement and their families.  \n \nDCF proposes to form an internal workgroup responsible to carry out the DCF Needs Assessment \nplanning, implementation, recommendation, and follow-up.  The internal workgroup will be \nheaded by Assistant Commissioner of Performance Management and Accountability (PMA), and \nincludes additional staff from across the Department, including representation from the Office of \nStrategic Development, the Office of Quality, the Office of Research, Evaluation and Reporting \n(RER), the Office of Contracting, as well as staff in key roles across the DCP&P, CSOC and FCP.  \nThis group will be comprised of leaders with authority to ensure discussions are productive and \ndecisions are made timely. \n \nIn an effort to better collaborate and receive feedback from stakeholders, the creation of an external \nstakeholder board is imperative. This group will be comprised of a broad range of individuals \nrepresenting  community  based  agencies,  the  court  system,  families,  youth,  and  other  key \nparticipants from all three regions. This board will be charged with reviewing, interpreting, and \nvalidating findings from the DCF Needs Assessment and working with DCF’s internal workgroup \nto formulate recommendations for action.  Recommendations will then be incorporated into a final \nreport and utilized by DCF’s internal workgroup to strategically plan regional or local service \nimprovements and, when appropriate, statewide enhancements. \n \nWhile the external stakeholders function as an intermediary that ensures community feedback is \nincorporated, it is the internal workgroup that is accountable to ensure appropriate and meaningful \nsteps are taken to strengthen the overall system.   \n \nSince the DCF Needs Assessment is designed to identify the placement and service needs for \nchildren and youth in out of home settings, as well as service demands of at risk families, the \nprocess must be positioned to identify local variation among needs.  In order to address the array \nof service needs across the state, DCF will divide the state into three regions (North, Central, and \nSouth) focusing on one region each year over a three-year period to ensure each region is assessed \nevery three years. The regions consist of seven counties each and are identified below: \n \nNorthern Region: Bergen County, Essex County, Hudson County, Morris County, Passaic \nCounty, Sussex County, and Union County \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-2 \n\n \nCentral Region: Hunterdon County, Mercer County, Middlesex County, Monmouth County, \nOcean County, Somerset County, and Warren County \n \nSouthern Region: Atlantic County, Burlington County, Cape May County, Camden County, \nCumberland County, Gloucester County, and Salem County  \n \nThe DCF needs assessment will take a systematic and comprehensive approach based on the \nframework outlined by McKenzie, Neiger, and Thackeray (2012) in Planning, Implementing, and \nEvaluating Health Promotion Programs.  DCF’s needs assessment will include four phases \nincluding I) gather, analyze and summarize existing data available across a variety of quantitative \nand qualitative data sources; II) collect and analyze new data from stakeholders to identify and \nprioritize needs across specific subpopulations; III) identify and evaluate current services; and IV) \nvalidate needs identified and make recommendations.  Each of the four phases in the needs \nassessment is discussed in more detail below and will be implemented by DCF staff and key \npartners. By utilizing this robust, mixed-methods approach, DCF can expand its reach and \nunderstanding of current service needs, existing services, and gaps.  \n \nTo ensure accountability and timelines for this process, DCF will generate interim reports at the \nconclusion of each phase of the needs assessment to be reviewed by both internal and external \nworkgroups in order to inform the next phase of the needs assessment.  Analysis of all data will \nculminate in a final report, informed by the external stakeholder board, that summarizes a \nprioritized list of needs, gaps in services for the specific region under review, and provide \nrecommendations for action to improve the overall system.  The final report will have a broad \ndistribution as it is anticipated to heavily impact service delivery, contracting, budgeting, and \nprogrammatic decision-making.  \n \nIII.    Implementation \nPhase I:  Gather, Analyze and Summarize Existing Data \n \nThe first phase of the DCF needs assessment is to review, analyze and summarize all sources of \ndata currently available to DCF through a variety of sources.  Using the attached chart (Appendix \nB), DCF staff will collect an accounting of the variety of different needs assessment-like processes \noccurring across the department.  DCF regularly collects both quantitative and qualitative data for \ncase and performance management purposes. In order to leverage all of the processes underway at \nDCF, the full scope of the available data must be clear.   \n \nFor example, Family and Community Partnerships (FCP) has partnered with the NJ Task Force on \nChild Abuse and Neglect, Prevention Committee to design and implement a new Statewide \nPrevention Plan.  The Prevention Plan was created based on the results of a similar needs \nassessment process conducted by an outside entity with a focus on intact families who are \nconsidered at risk.  Similarly, the Office of Adolescent Services (OAS) is also engaged in a needs \nassessment process for older youth involved184 with DCP&P and has planned a needs assessment \nas part of a recently awarded federal planning grant. Another example is the data collected through \n                                                 \n184 The OAS processes look at youth living independently, living in out of home placements, or family.  \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-3 \n\n \nother continuous quality improvement efforts across the Department such as Qualitative Reviews \n(QR), targeted record reviews, and other existing surveys that generate reports summarizing \nfindings on a variety of subpopulations and topics. Therefore, DCF proposes that the needs \nassessment begins with a thorough review of existing reports and publications that assess needs \nfrom across the Department. \n \nAs a second step, DCF will analyze existing administrative data from New Jersey SPIRIT (NJS), \nthe child welfare case management system, as well as SafeMeasures, a performance management \nsystem available to all staff. In addition to the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) tracked through \nSafeMeasures, DCF tracks data on placement of children and youth in out-of-home care, repeat \nmaltreatment and re-entry into care, permanency outcomes, educational stability, physical and \nmental health care, services to families, and services to older youth. The DCF data system allows \nfor tracking information at the macro and micro levels with data available by child, family, \ncaseworker, local office, region, and/or state levels.  \n \nThe administrative data will be used to understand the basic placement and service needs of the \nentire out-of-home population.   This analysis will begin with understanding the demographics and \ndescriptive factors (i.e. age, race, geography, type of abuse, type of placement, placement stability, \nlength of stay) of the out-of-home target population and the regional variation that exists across \nthe State.    \n \nThe next step will be to look at the data available through the Standard Decision Making (SDM) \ntools used by caseworkers to assess families.  Each family that is investigated for a CPS report has \na Safety and a Risk Assessment conducted during the investigation.  These assessments can \nprovide information about identified risk factors for families as one indication of potential service \nneeds.  Although there are some limitations in using this data to draw conclusions as to the needs \nof families, it provides additional points of reference when analyzed in aggregate.  Additionally, \nwhen a case is open for services with DCP&P, the caseworker is required to do a Strengths and \nNeeds Assessment for both the child and the caregiver every six months as part of the planning \nprocess. These assessments contain information on physical and mental health, coping skills, \nsubstance use, relationships, parenting skills, and financial resources. Again, while this data may \nhave some limitations in its utility, an analysis of the Strengths and Needs data will be the best \nsource of information to take a broad look at all children placed in out-of-home care across the \nState as well as the needs of intact families at risk.    \n \nIn addition to the SDM tools, DCF will aggregate data of professional and diagnostic assessments \n(i.e. psychological or psychiatric assessments) being requested and paid for by DCP&P as a proxy \nfor the type of referral services needed for children and families.  This analysis will look at the \nfrequency of services secured to support the needs of a family; such as childcare, transportation, \nfamily preservation services, individual and family therapy, homemaker services and others.  The \nfocus will rely heavily on services that DCF pays for on a fee-for-service185 basis to increase the \nlikelihood of quality data. The data when taken in aggregate can provide an accounting of the \nfrequency and types of services children, youth and their families are receiving.  This will be \n                                                 \n185 Services provided to families on a fee-for-service basis, require casework staff to enter payment information into \nNJS thereby increasing the likelihood of accurate information because if there is no payment, the family cannot \naccess the service timely. \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-4 \n\n \nincorporated into DCF’s larger inventory of contracted services for a complete picture of available \nresources regardless of payment type and matched with identified needs and service demands in \nPhase III of the needs assessment.  \n \nWhen results of all these data sources outlined above are combined through the DCF needs \nassessment,  the  Department  will  have  a  comprehensive,  multi-source  understanding  of  the \nplacement and service needs of all children and youth in out of home placement and families whose \nchildren may be at risk for entry into out of home placement. Understanding the results of \ncompleted and ongoing assessments across the Department will allow DCF to synthesize all that \nis  known  about  the  current  needs  of  children,  youth  and  families  served  by  Department. \nAdditionally, given the timing and similarities of the other needs assessments, this work will \nmaximize understanding to avoid duplication of efforts, and leverage a multitude of resources and \nexpertise to sufficiently assess the needs of both the out-of-home population as well as intact \nfamilies in order to fully satisfy the MSA requirements.  \n \nIn turn, understanding what story the exiting data tells, leads to decisions about what populations \nand topics need further exploration in phase II of the needs assessment. In phase II, DCF will \ncollect additional data to improve our in-depth knowledge of the specific placement and service \nneeds of certain subpopulations.  The deliverables due to both internal and external workgroups at \nthe conclusion of Phase I are as follows: \n  Meta Analysis of the array of needs assessments within DCF; \n  Summary of the analysis of DCF administrative data at the statewide and when available \nat the county/DCP&P Local Office level; \n  Guidance to DCP&P leadership about using the analyses completed to inform decision-\nmaking broader than for the DCF Needs Assessment process, and; \n  Areas to focus on in primary data collection processes. \n \nPhase II: Collect and Analyze New Data and Prioritize Needs  \n \nPrimary data collection strategies will be used in the DCF Needs Assessment to delve more deeply \ninto understanding aspects of the findings from Phase I.  In order to achieve this, DCF will create \nstructured interview guides and surveys to conduct informational interviews, focus groups, and \npopulation based surveys to yield a more in-depth analysis of targeted subpopulations of interest.  \nFor example, much is known about the need for additional services for parents with a substance \nuse disorder.  However, the administrative data will not be able to answer questions about the level \nof care needed, the type of substance used by the participant in the program, the quality and \naccessibility of the service, or whether the service provided meets the current need. This data \ncollection process provides the opportunity to interview DCP&P local office staff about referred \nservices for families, anticipated outcomes, and insight into the decision making process that leads \nto a referral for services. \n \nDCF will conduct structured informational interviews with external providers, key community \ninformants, and DCP&P leadership located in the region being assessed as needed. Administered \nby PMA staff, these discussions will provide expert opinions on the needs of the community to \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-5 \n\n \nassist DCF with better understanding the placement and service needs children and families are \nencountering. Providers will be chosen based on their presence in the community (i.e. they serve \na wide variety of DCP&P families in their region) as well as through discussions with local \nDCP&P leadership to ensure that key information is received from the most knowledgeable \nindividuals who are deeply engaged in providing children, youth and their families with quality \ncare. Once completed, interview responses will be analyzed in order to identify themes and trends. \nThese responses will inform the development of questions for the population-based survey as well \nas to inform the structured interview guide for focus group. \n \nDCF will conduct focus groups with approximately four target groups: provider agencies, youth, \nfamilies, and DCP&P staff. Each group will consist of 6-10 individuals invited through a formal \nprocess and meetings will last approximately 45-90 minutes. Utilizing 8-10 targeted open-ended \nquestions, DCF will lead discussions in an opportunity to identify broad and sweeping issues \naffecting youth in out-of-home placements and families with children at risk of placement and the \ntype of services needed to address these issues. Focus group meetings will take place in an area \nthat is convenient for members in the relevant region to help enable consistent attendance. Once \ncompleted, focus group responses will be analyzed in order to identify themes and trends. These \nresponses will also inform the development of questions for the population-based survey.  \n \nSurveys are a key component to any needs assessment as they allow us to target a larger population \nthan focus groups and informational interviews. Three parallel surveys will be created to capture \nthe responses of providers, youth/families, and DCP&P staff members. All will be similar but \nadapted to respondent’s roles. \n \nEach survey will focus on understanding the placement and service needs of the target population, \nas well as the current services available to address those needs.  The questions will be constructed \nbased on the information gathered during the informational interviews and focus groups to ask \nspecific  questions  that  focus  not  only  on  the  service  needs,  but  also  on  the  availability, \neffectiveness, and accessibility of services in the designated area. Broad areas of services will be \ndefined as opposed to individual service agencies. For example, substance abuse screening, case \nmanagement services, and therapeutic services may each be part of a broader array of service needs \nanalyzed.  \n \nDCF will conduct approximately 25 surveys within each target group (i.e. provider agencies, \nyouth, families, and DCP&P staff) that contain a mixture of open and closed ended questions. This \nwill allow opportunities for individuals to leave more substantial comments. Key questions \ninclude: What are the most useful services? How do you use this service? How helpful are these \nservices? The majority of the questions will be close-ended allowing individuals to rate each \nquestion to the best of their abilities using a Likert scale. Additional surveys of up to 200 per target \ngroup that are entirely closed-ended will be conducted using a similar question format.  All surveys \nwill be available both online and in paper format to accommodate families who do not have internet \naccess.  \n \nAfter all data is collected, DCF staff will analyze all data from both existing data sources and \nnewly collected data to identify and prioritize placement and service needs as well as service \ndemands as outlined by the stakeholders.  The analysis will focus on understanding the needs \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-6 \n\n \namong the entire population but also on targeted subpopulations when possible as there will likely \nbe variation in need across various subgroups (e.g. geography, age, placement type, stakeholder \ntype, etc.).  The ultimate goal of the analysis is to develop a prioritized list of needs for review.  \nEach identified need will be ranked using the priority ranking process as outlined by McKenzie et \nal. This process allows each identified need to be ranked across four different components to \ngenerate a priority score.  These components are as follows: \nA.  size of the problem (0 to 10) \nB.  seriousness of the problem (0 to 20) \nC.  effectiveness of the possible interventions (0 to 10) \nD.  feasibility or the ability to conduct an intervention based on economics, resources, and \nlegality (0 or 1) \nBasic priority rating (BPR) = [(A + B) * C ] / 3 * D \n \nDCF in consultation with the external stakeholder board will assign a priority score to each need \nidentified.  These priority ratings will serve as a guide for DCF and its partners to make decisions \non where to invest resources.  There are likely to be many needs that arise from this process and \nthe priority rating will provide some quantitative metric by which to make decisions based on the \nvolume and seriousness of the need. Ultimately, decisions will be made based on the totality of the \nneeds assessment, but the priority score will inform the decision making.   \n \nThere will likely be a myriad of needs identified from this needs assessments across a variety of \ntopic areas.  With limited available resources, DCF must prioritize the needs of the children and \nfamilies of the State based on the charge of the Department.  A priority score would be given a “0” \nif the need falls outside DCF’s scope of work.  This need would still be reported out in the regional \nand final reports, however, DCF would work with the external stakeholder group to identify \nappropriate State and community partners that would be better suited to address these needs \ndirectly.  For example, should community or gang violence be identified as a high priority need \nfrom  our  focus  group  and  survey  data  collection,  that  is  an  important  piece  of  actionable \ninformation.  However, DCF may do a “warm transfer” of this knowledge to another State agency \nor community provider to focus on this need as it more squarely fits within their strategic \npriorities.    A priority score of “0” would never be given based solely on the availability of DCF \nresources, especially if the need falls within the mission and scope of work of the Department. \n \nAt the conclusion of Phase II, the following deliverables will be available to the workgroups for \nreview: \n  Results and summary of themes from informational interviews and focus groups \n  Summary of findings from population-based survey outlining both general needs and needs \nof specific subpopulations, and; \n  Summary of the highest priority of needs.  \n \n   \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-7 \n\n \nPhase III: Identify and Evaluate Current Services  \n \nOnce needs are defined and prioritized for a region, DCF will identify the existing landscape and \nutilization levels of contracted and community based resources available to children, youth and \nfamilies in the region geared toward addressing the highest priority needs identified. DCF will rely \non  content  analysis  of  Business/Area/Local  Office  information  (i.e.  contracts  and  provider \nquarterly reports) as well as data available through DCF Central Office supports (i.e. financial \ndownloads). Through this process, DCF will also make a determination if contracted services are \noffering best practice; evidence based, or evidence informed programs. \n \nDCF will match the service landscape and utilization data against findings from Phase II above on \nthe availability and effectiveness/satisfaction with existing services in the region to assist with \nidentifying gaps or barriers that need to be addressed. This analysis will provide DCF with a better \nunderstanding of what programs are available to the target population; which programs are being \nutilized; how effective/satisfied stakeholders are with programming, and an overall understanding \nif the identified needs of the target population are being served.  The Phase III process and \ndeliverables will inform the recommendation process and/or prioritize recommendations if there \nare competing priorities. \n \nPhase III deliverables are as follows: \n  Inventory of contracted and community based services relevant to the areas of need \nexplored in the DCF needs assessment; \n  Summary on the frequency existing services are accessed and/or the levels of service \ncontracted providers are providing. \n  Identification of potential gaps in identified needs and existing service array. \n \nPhase IV: Validate Needs Identified and Make Recommendations   \n \nAfter all needs are identified and prioritized, and after the existing service array is examined for \ngaps, a summary of the findings will be shared with the external stakeholder board. Together, \nDCF’s internal workgroup and the external stakeholder board will validate and prioritize the \nidentified placement and service needs identified by professional stakeholders along with the \nservice demands identified by youth and families to create a blended list of priorities for DCF.   \nThese groups together will use the list of prioritized needs to develop recommendations for change.  \nDCF’s  internal  workgroup  will  be  responsible  for  turning  these  recommendations  into  an \nactionable plan. This plan will be comprised of practical steps that can be measured and evaluated \nover time. \n \nUpon completing all data collection, analysis, and stakeholder engagement, a summary will be \nwritten by DCF forming an easily understandable report that will highlight key statistics and \nfindings from each area of need as well as emphasize any regional trends.  After the completion of \nthe DCF Needs Assessment in the primary region, a preliminary report will be drafted highlighting \nthe trends in service, strengths, and challenges associated with youth in out-of-home placements \nand families with children at risk of out of home placement. This report will also incorporate \nrecommendations  for  action  for  each  specific  region  along  with  introductory  plans  to  be \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v. Christie    Appendix C-8 \n\n \nimplemented.  The  report  will  be  given  to  DCF  leadership  providing  recommendations  on \nnecessary changes to the system and services. \n \nIV.  Conclusion \nOnce the statewide data collection and analysis is completed in the first year of the DCF Needs \nAssessment, this process will be repeated for the other two regions culminating in the entire state \nbeing completed in three years.  The deliverables at the end of each phase will serve as interim \nupdates to keep the internal and external workgroups appraised of progress made, decision-making \nprocesses and to provide overall accountability for the DCF Needs Assessment. \n \nPreliminary reports such as this will be written for all three regions. Upon completing analysis of \nthe third and final region, a comprehensive report will be drafted focusing on both regional and \nstatewide system issues, recommendations for change, and subsequent tasks to mitigate these \nchallenges. Reports, available by county, will be disseminated broadly on an annual basis, posted \non the DCF website as well as shared with community based organizations, staff, and a broad array \nof stakeholders.   \n \n \n \nProgress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families      July 2014  \nMonitoring Period XIV Report for Charlie and Nadine H. v.

Chesler of the United States District Court for the District of New \nJersey as Monitor of Charlie and Nadine H. v. Corzine. As Monitor, CSSP is to \nindependently assess New Jersey’s compliance with the goals, principles and outcomes of the \nModified Settlement Agreement (MSA) of the class action litigation aimed at improving the \nState’s child welfare system.1 CSSP released its Period I Monitoring Report in February 2007 \ndescribing progress New Jersey had made towards compliance with the MSA as of December \n31, 2006.2 CSSP released its Period II Monitoring Report in October 2007.3 This is the third \nMonitoring Report under the MSA and covers the period of July 1, 2007 through December \n31, 2007. \n \nThe MSA structures the State’s commitments into two phases of work. Phase I (through \nDecember 2008) is primarily directed to building a strong infrastructure within the \nDepartment of Children and Families (DCF) to ensure children are healthy and safe; children \nachieve permanency and stability; and resource and service delivery systems meet children’s \nhealth, mental health, educational and developmental needs. This third Monitoring Report \nreflects the State’s continued work in and commitment to these foundational elements of a \nsuccessful reform, and also describes the Department’s beginning efforts to train its workforce \non the new Case Practice Model (CPM), a central element of New Jersey’s child welfare \nreforms. \n \nMethodology \nThe primary source of information for this Monitoring Report is information provided by \nDCF and verified by the Monitor.

During this Monitoring period, the Monitor \nobserved DYFS Local Office Manager and Area Director meetings, visited DYFS Local \nOffices with Child Health Units (CHUs), observed interdivisional out-of-state child \nconferences and Family Team Meetings and spent a good deal of time at the State Central \nRegistry (SCR) reviewing operations. In addition, a telephone survey to 13 local offices was \nused to validate caseload data. The Monitor also spoke with various levels of DCF staff in \nevery Division4 and with external stakeholders of New Jersey’s child welfare system, \nincluding the New Jersey Partnership for Child Welfare Program5, foster parents, relatives \nand birth parents, advocacy organizations and the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA). \n \nSection II of the report provides overall conclusions and a summary of the State’s progress in \nmeeting the MSA requirements through December 31, 2007. \n \nOther sections of the report provide specific information on the requirements of the MSA as \nfollows: \n \nSECTION III:  Continuing to Build a High Quality Workforce and \nManagement Infrastructure \n \nSECTION IV:  Changing Practice to Support Children and Families \n \nSECTION V:  Appropriate Placements and Services for Children \n \nSECTION VI:  Meeting the Health and Mental Health Needs of Children \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 These include: Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS); Division of Child Behavioral Health Services \n(DCBHS); Division of Prevention and Community Partnerships; Policy and Planning; Central Operations and \nTraining. \n5 At the beginning of this monitoring period, DCF changed the name of the Child Welfare Training Consortium \nto the NJ Partnership for Child Welfare Program. \n  2\n\n \nII.  SUMMARY OF PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES AHEAD \n \nSummary of Accomplishments \nSignificant accomplishments toward meeting the requirements of the Modified Settlement \nAgreement (MSA) continued in the six month period between July 1 and December 31, 2007 \n– both in the work to build a solid infrastructure within the Department of Children and \nFamilies (DCF) and in launching some important and transformative changes in the ways in \nwhich child welfare is practiced in New Jersey. As shown in summary fashion in Table 1 on \npages 10 to 14 and discussed in more detail in this report, DCF fulfilled and sometimes \nexceeded the expectations of the MSA in almost every area in which the MSA called for \nactivity. \n \nHighlights of the Monitor’s assessment of progress include: \n \nThe Department continued to develop the infrastructure it needs to promote and sustain \nreform. Examples include: \n \nStaffing \n•  DCF achieved or exceeded the December 2007 caseload targets for Permanency, \nIntake and Adoption Staff. Caseloads in offices across the State are at or approaching \nlevels where it is possible to begin to implement the Department’s Case Practice \nModel and to more effectively serve children and families. \n \n•  DCF exceeded the MSA benchmark for the ratio of supervisors to workers with 98% \nof offices in compliance with a five to one supervisory ratio. \n \nTraining  \n•  The Department met all of the expectations in the MSA related to training. \n \no  In the past six months, 168 new staff (98%) completed 160 class hours of Pre-\nService training, including Intake and Investigations training, within two \nweeks of being hired and passed competency exams on the training content. \n \no  In calendar year 2007, 3001 staff (99%) received the required hours of In-\nService training which mostly focused, in this period, on learning how to use \nNJ SPIRIT. \n \no  386 staff were trained in Concurrent Planning as part of the State’s work to \nimprove permanency outcomes for children. \n \no  A new training team was established composed of the Child Welfare Policy \nand Practice Group (CWPPG) and a collaboration of New Jersey Social Work \nSchools led by Rutgers University School of Social Work with the DCF \nTraining Academy. The team began the work to provide training to every \nDivision of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) worker, supervisor and case \n  3\n\n \naide on the new Case Practice Model. (See separate discussion below on \nimplementation of the Case Practice Model.) \n  \no  62 new Investigators (95%) received training and passed competency exams \nbefore assuming caseloads. \n \no  44 new Adoption workers (100%) received adoption training in this \nmonitoring period. \n \no  52 Supervisors appointed in the last monitoring period and 13 appointed in this \nmonitoring period, for a total of 65 newly promoted supervisors (100% of \nsupervisors requiring such training) were trained between July 1, 2007 and \nDecember 31, 2007. \n \nData \n•  NJ SPIRIT, the State’s new automated child welfare information system, was rolled-\nout statewide in August 2007. The roll-out was not without significant (and \nanticipated) on-the-ground implementation problems, but DCF made successful \nexecution of NJ SPIRIT one of its highest priorities and attacked each problem with \nfocus and urgency. Work continues to fix remaining problems with the hardware, \nsoftware and its applications and interfaces. In addition, work has begun to routinely \nproduce meaningful management reports from NJ SPIRIT and to realize the benefits \nto frontline workers and managers regarding documentation of case management \nactivities and standardizing other business processes.  \n \n•  For example, during this period DCF developed and began implementation of a new \ntracking system linked to NJ SPIRIT to find Resource Family homes available for \nplacement. The system is designed to provide real-time information on available \nhomes and to facilitate appropriate matching for children. \n \nThe Department continued its work to promote and support a consistent model of case \npractice that is intended to improve outcomes for children and families. \n \n•  Following the development of its Case Practice Model Implementation Plan, DCF has \nmoved systematically to create and execute a schedule to train its workforce of 4,000 \nemployees on the new Case Practice Model by the end of 2008. The training plan was \ndeveloped and will be carried out with help from consultants and partners from social \nservice schools statewide.  \n \n•  The implementation process involves a “train-the-trainer” model that develops trainers \nfor regional training teams deployed locally to provide intensive Case Practice Model \ntraining to staff and community partners. As of December 31, 2007 training teams had \ndelivered 13 days of train-the-trainer sessions at which 38 trainers, 54 executive and \nsenior management staff, and 108 case work supervisors were trained on the new Case \nPractice Model.  \n  4\n\n \n \n•  DCF began intensive training in four selected Immersion Sites (Bergen Central, \nBurlington East, Gloucester West and Mercer North Local Offices) that involves \ncoaching, practicing and partnering with families. The intensive training envisions \nstaff and leadership working closely with Area Directors, Assistant Area Directors and \nlocal community partners to create the environment in which Family Team Meetings \nwill become routine and will embody the critical elements of the new Case Practice \nModel. Each region will ultimately be designated an Immersion Site and receive this \nintensive training. \n \nSignificant progress was made on increasing appropriate placement and other resources \nfor children throughout the State.  \n \n•  DCF achieved its mandate to license 1,071 new non-kin Resource Family homes, \nlicensing a total of 1,367 new non-kin foster and adoptive homes between January 1, \n2007 and December 31, 2007, surpassing by 296 homes, the target set in the MSA. \n \n•  DCF achieved a net increase of more than 800 licensed resource homes statewide, \nwith a net increase in all 21 counties. The largest increase was in Essex County, which \nrepresents 11% of the total net increase, and the second largest was in Camden County \nwith 10% of the total net increase.  \n \n•  DCF implemented a new Resource Family licensing tracking system as part of the NJ \nSPIRIT roll-out. \n \n•  DCF made significant progress in returning children to New Jersey from out-of-state \ncongregate care placement. As of March 7, 2008, 213 children are placed out-of-state, \ndown from 306 at the conclusion of the last monitoring period. This reduction reflects \nthe Department’s focus on increasing the array of community-based mental health \nservices and therapeutic placements to assist in maintaining children in their home, in \ntheir community and in New Jersey. \n \nThe State exceeded its goals for the successful adoption of children requiring permanent \nhomes.  \n \n•  1540 children’s adoptions were finalized in calendar year 2007, exceeding the MSA \ntarget of 1400 adoptions.  \n \n•  DCF reduced the number of children legally free and awaiting adoption from 2,260 on \nJanuary 1, 2006 to 1,295 on December 31, 2007, a 44% decrease over two years. The \nDepartment also achieved promising results from its intensive work to find homes for \nyouth who have been waiting for a long time.  \n \no  DCF made progress with the 100 Longest Waiting Teens (mostly aged 14 and \nolder) in this monitoring period. Every youth in the group is paired with a \n  5\n\n \nmember of the Teen Recruitment Impact Team, staff members who have had \nspecial training on recruitment and permanency planning for adolescents. \n \no  3 of the longest waiting youth have been adopted and another 25 are close to \npermanency, whether through adoption or kinship legal guardianship. \n \nThe early work of the Differential Response pilot programs and the expanded network of \nFamily Success Centers promises to create new avenues to support children and families \nand to avoid formal child welfare intervention. \n \n•  DCF awarded approximately $4.2 million to pilot sites covering Camden, \nCumberland, Gloucester and Salem Counties to engage vulnerable families and \nprovide supportive prevention services and promote healthy family functioning. The \nDifferential Response pilot sites respond to families 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nMany families are directly referred from the State’s centralized child abuse and \nneglect hotline (SCR) through a warm-line telephone transfer. Between September \n2007 and December 31, 2007, 124 families were referred to the Differential Response \ninitiatives.  \n \n•  The Peace: A Learned Solution (PALS) violence prevention program was expanded to \nAtlantic, Monmouth, Ocean and Union Counties in addition to the previously-existing \ncapacity in Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex and Passiac \nCounties. This evidence-based program provides comprehensive assessment and \ntreatment for children and non-offending parents exposed to domestic violence in an \nattempt to reduce the impact and to break the cycle of abuse for future generations. \n \n•  During the summer of 2007, DCF awarded new funding to twenty-one Family Success \nCenters and with some increased funding transitioned 11 FACES programs into \nFamily Success Centers to expand the network to a total of 32 state-supported centers \nin 16 counties. The Family Success Centers offer primary and secondary child abuse \nprevention services and bring together community residents, leaders and agencies to \naddress the problems that lead to child abuse and neglect. These services are available \nto any family in the community with no prerequisites. In addition, DCF continued its \nwork as a pilot program of the national Strengthening Families Initiative, seeking to \nprevent child abuse and neglect through work to support families in early care and \neducation settings. \n \nChallenges Ahead \nThe Department has much to be proud of in terms of its accomplishments in this monitoring \nperiod and since its creation in July 2006. Stakeholders throughout the State have observed \nand shared with the Monitor their views that the New Jersey child welfare system in 2008 is \non the road toward positive reform. While it is equally clear that the system’s expectations for \nhigh quality, individualized and effective practice for every child and family it serves have not \nyet been realized, there is increasingly a shared view that this goal is possible. At the same \ntime, the fragility of the reforms and the importance of follow-through on plans just \n  6\n\n \ndeveloped or only beginning to be implemented are obvious. It is for these reasons that the \nMonitor, the plaintiffs and other State stakeholders are concerned about the potential impact \nof two specific challenges on the horizon.  \n \nThe first challenge is successfully managing the leadership transition necessitated by the \ndeparture, on March 14, 2008, of Kevin Ryan, the first Commissioner of the Department of \nChildren and Families (DCF), and the impending departure of Molly Armstrong, the Director \nof Policy and Planning in April 2008. From the Monitor’s perspective, Commissioner Ryan \nprovided exceptional leadership for the new Department and has succeeded in setting a \ndirection for change, for rebuilding the workforce and for laying the groundwork for \nfundamental reform in the practice of child welfare in New Jersey. During the first year, much \nof the work was focused on stabilizing a state structure and a workforce that was confused \nabout the mission, values and practice of child welfare in New Jersey and were demoralized \nby years of high caseloads, inadequate resources, poor follow-through on plans and \ninsufficient funding. With the support of Governor Corzine and the Legislature, the \nCommissioner identified problems, sought advice from the field, and moved forward \naggressively to secure needed internal and external resources. Across the State, significant \nnew resources through Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), Division of Child \nBehavioral Health Services (DCBHS) and through the Division of Prevention and Community \nPartnerships have been developed to support families and serve children.  \n \nCommissioner Ryan’s successor, however, will inherit a system that has only begun the \nprocess of change, with many ambitious plans about to be implemented, pilot efforts just \nbeginning to yield results and a score of internal and community partners that are skeptical \nthat the work in progress will be continued and sustained. The reform process has barely \nbegun to take root on the ground and is only just beginning to be felt in the field, by families \nand with the public. Successful reform will need continued support, attention and resources in \norder to achieve its full potential. The able Director of DYFS, Eileen Crummy, has agreed to \nserve as Acting Commissioner while the search for a permanent replacement is found. The \nActing Commissioner is knowledgeable and experienced and can provide consistent and \nstable leadership during this transition period, which is essential. The Acting Commissioner \nwill need to move forward with urgency and as importantly, will need the tangible support of \nthe Governor and the Legislature to keep the reform on track during this transition period. The \nidentification of a highly skilled permanent Commissioner for DCF needs to remain a top \npriority for Governor Corzine. \n \nThe second overall challenge in the months ahead is ensuring that the State’s FY 2009 budget \nprovides the resources necessary to continue the child welfare, community prevention and \nchildren’s behavioral health reforms. The Governor’s proposed budget includes modest cuts \nfor DCF, but appears to provide sufficient funding to carry out existing commitments. \nHowever, the budget that emerges from the legislative process must maintain these essential \nresources, for the explicit commitments within the Modified Settlement Agreement, to \nachieve good outcomes for children and families and for the continued development of the \ncommunity-based prevention, behavioral health and other service resources that must \nsurround and work in partnership with an effective child welfare system.  \n  7\n\n \n \nA related concern is the Governor’s proposal to offer early retirement options for state \nemployees and allow agencies to replace only 10% of employees who leave as a result of \nexercising early retirement options. The Monitor is concerned that early retirement incentives \ncould seriously impact management and middle management expertise in DCF. Further, the \nproposal to limit an agency’s ability to replace vacated positions would have devastating \nconsequences for DCF which has only just begun to rebuild a workforce sufficient to its \nmission and mandated responsibilities.  \n \nBeyond these overarching issues, there are three areas of work where significant \nimplementation challenges remain ahead.  \n \nThe Monitor’s last report identified as a challenge the Department’s Health Care Plan. There \nhas been progress in this period with an operational plan and model6 to institute Child Health \nUnits in every local office with sufficient resources to ensure children receive pre-placement \nexaminations, comprehensive medical and behavioral health assessments and timely follow-\nup treatment and care. The plan is both ambitious and sound and when fully implemented by \nthe end of 2008, should have a significant positive impact on children in the Department’s \ncare. However, establishing fully staffed Child Health Units in each local DYFS office is an \nenormous undertaking and will need high level management attention, further development \nand deployment of resources to realize its potential. Accessible and appropriate space for the \nHealth Units remains an issue in some areas and the shortage of willing providers of specialty \ndental care (despite recent changes to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates) has not been fully \nresolved.  \n \nAnother continuing challenge for the Department over the next year is completing the \nimplementation of NJ SPIRIT. During the past six months, the Department has succeeded in \nrolling-out NJ SPIRIT without large-scale breakdowns or setbacks. However, as has been \nexperienced in every State that has implemented a complex information system change like \nNJ SPIRIT, many staff continue to have difficulty integrating the new system into their daily \nwork, and although the number and frequency are greatly reduced, New Jersey staff continue \nto discover glitches in the system that need to be fixed. Consistent and focused attention will \ncontinue to be required over the next monitoring period and beyond to make NJ SPIRIT as \nefficient as possible to support workers and in order to effectively utilize its enormous \npotential for management reporting and data analysis.  \n \nA final challenge will be the successful implementation of DCF’s new Case Practice Model. \nThe completion of the work in the Immersion Sites and the roll-out throughout the State will \nrequire oversight, consistent management and insight to see that its potential is fulfilled. This \nundertaking cannot succeed if accomplished only in name or in part. To make and sustain the \nfundamental changes in practice statewide that are envisioned, all offices need intensive \ntraining, coaching, and supervision. The vision of a family-centered approach cannot happen \nwithout all stakeholders fully engaging in the reform effort. To date, most of the work has \n                                                 \n6 As of March 13, 2008, fully operational Child Health Units exist in Sussex and Hunterdon Counties. \n \n  8\n\n \nbeen focused on DYFS staff and their immediate partners, but as the work moves forward, the \nmental health community, Judges, the Attorney General’s office, legal representatives of \nparents and children and others will have to be more systematically involved.  \n \nThe Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) charged the Monitor with establishing the \nmeasures and methods to be used to assess implementation of the Case Practice Model. \nAttached as Appendix C is a matrix identifying the measures, data sources and timeframes for \nmeasuring Case Practice Model implementation going forward. This matrix was developed by \nthe Monitor, in consultation with both DCF and plaintiffs, and when finalized, with approval \nof the Court, will become an enforceable part of the Modified Settlement Agreement. In some \nareas, the baseline, benchmarks, and ultimate performance measures are not yet finalized.7 \nOver the next six months, as the Department is increasingly able to provide accurate baseline \ndata on several of the measures, the Monitor will set interim and final monitoring targets in \neach area. \n \n \n                                                 \n7 Section III of the Modified Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to set interim or final performance \ntargets on key measures by December 2008. \n  9\n\n \nTable 1: \nSummary of State Progress on Modified Settlement Agreement Requirements  \n(July 2007 – December 2007) \nFulfilled \nSettlement Agreement Requirements  Due Date  Comments \n(Yes/No) \n \nNew Case Practice Model \n      The Monitor, in consultation \nII.A.4.

CONTINUING TO BUILD A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE AND \nMANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nA.  Caseloads \n \nNo child welfare system can be expected to be successful unless and until it has a sufficient, \nwell-trained and stable workforce. Significantly reducing caseloads was a primary \ncommitment of the Department of Children and Families’ (DCF) basic stabilization plan and \nis an essential building block for the overall success of New Jersey’s child welfare reform. \nThe State continued to demonstrate progress in this area during this reporting period by \nmeeting all of the staffing commitments in the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA), as \ndiscussed below. Reduction in worker caseloads across the State has created an environment \nconducive to moving forward with the Case Practice Model implementation and other \nreforms. As of December 31, 2007, the State reported that only 4% of DYFS workers had \ncaseloads of more than 20 families. Among the 84 case managers with caseloads greater than \n20 families, 75 case managers had caseloads of 21 to 30 families and nine case managers had \ncaseloads of 31 or more families.  \n \n1.  DCF DYFS exceeded the December 2007 caseload target set for Permanency staff. \n \nPermanency workers are assigned to provide case management of services to families whose \nchildren remain at home under the protective supervision of DYFS and those families whose \nchildren are removed from home due to safety concerns. To ensure staff has the time to \ndevote to children and families with diverse needs and circumstances, the State agreed to \nachieve a caseload standard that has two intertwined components. One component is the \nnumber of families and the other component is the number of children placed out of home. \nThis has been referred to as a “two prong” standard. Permanency workers are to serve no \nmore than 15 families and 10 children in out-of-home care. If a case manager has a caseload \nhigher than either of these components, the caseload is not compliant with the MSA standard \n(Section II.E). \n \nDuring Phase I (until December 2008), caseload compliance is measured by average \ncaseloads in an office. By December 2007 and thereafter, 95% of all offices are to have \naverage caseloads for the Permanency workers that meet the two-pronged standard (Section \nII.E.12).10  \n \nAs displayed in Figure 2, the State exceeded this target with 100% of the offices having \naverage caseloads for available Permanency workers of 15 or fewer families and 10 or fewer \nchildren in out-of-home placement. Appendix A-3 contains a table with supporting details for \neach office. \n \n                                                 \n10 On December 31, 2007, there were 46 local offices. \n  15\n\n \nFigure 2: \nNJ DCF DYFS Permanency Caseloads \n7 Actual: 15 families &\n0\nc- 10 children in 100%\ne\nD placement\n7 Target: 15 families &\n0\nc- 10 children in 95%\ne\nD placement\nActual: 15 families &\n7\n0\nn- 10 children in 84%\nJu placement\nTarget: 15 families &\n8\n0\nn- 10 children in 79%\nJu placement\n6 Actual: 15 families &\n0\nc- 10 children in 60%\ne\nD placement\nTarget: 15 families &\nc\nDe 10 children in 60%\n6- placement\n8 Baseline: 15 families\n0\nMar- & 10 children in 40%\nplacement\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n% of DYFS offices meeting standard\n \n Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n Note: Adoption staff and cases were included in Permanency Caseloads in March 2006 only. \n \nThe Monitor verified the caseload information by reviewing the methodology employed by \nDCF staff to produce the caseload report as well as the process DCF uses for verifying and \nrefining the caseload reporting. The Monitor’s verification process included reviewing \nexamples of communication between central office and Local Office Managers regarding \nexception reporting and resolution. In addition to assessing DCF’s internal quality assurance \non the accuracy of DYFS caseload data, the Monitor collected information from telephone \ninterviews with Local Office Managers in thirteen randomly selected offices. This \nindependent review supports the accuracy of the State’s caseload reporting.  \n \n2.  DCF DYFS exceeded the December 2007 caseload target set for Intake staff. \n \nDYFS Intake staff are responsible for responding to community concerns regarding child \nsafety and well-being. They receive referrals from the State Central Registry (SCR) and \ndepending on the nature of the referral, they have between 2 hours and 5 days to visit the \nhome and begin their investigation or assessment. They are to complete their investigation or \nassessment within 60 days.  \n \nThe caseload standard for Intake staff also has two components. One component is the \nnumber of families under investigation or assessment at any given time and the other \n  16\n\n \ncomponent is the number of new referrals assigned to a worker each month. The standards for \ncaseload limits become progressively lower as the MSA implementation proceeds. When \nfully implemented in Phase II of the MSA, Intake workers are to have caseloads of 12 \nfamilies or less and 8 new referrals or less per month. (Section II.E.19) \n \nAs with the Permanency caseloads, the Phase I standard for Intake caseloads is based on \naverage caseloads in an office. By December 2008, the goal is for 95% of all offices to have \naverage caseloads for Intake workers that meet the two-pronged standard (MSA Section \nII.E.19). As of December 2007, 63% of all Local Offices were to have average caseloads for \nIntake staff of 15 families or less and 8 or fewer new referrals per month (MSA Section \nII.E.13). \n \nAs displayed in Figure 3, the State has exceeded the December 2007 target for Intake staff. As \nof December 2007, 76% of the offices had average caseloads for Intake staff at or below the \nstandard. These data were independently verified by the Monitor as part of the previously \ndescribed process. Appendix A-2 contains a table with supporting detail for each office. \n \nFigure 3: \nNJ DYFS Intake Caseloads11 \n07 Actual: 15 families &\nc- 73%\ne 8 new referrals\nD\n7\n0 Target: 15 families &\nc- 63%\ne 8 new referrals\nD\n07 Actual: 15 families &\nun- 10 new referrals 82%\nJ\n07 Target: 15 families &\n- 58%\nun 10 new referrals\nJ\n6\n0 Actual: 15 families &\nc- 65%\ne 10 new referrals\nD\n06 Target: 15 families &\nc- 42%\ne 10 new referrals\nD\n6\n0 Baseline: 15 families &\nr- 17%\na 10 new referrals\nM\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n% of DYFS offices meeting standard\n \n Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n                                                 \n11 At first glance, this could be read to suggest a decline from 82% compliance in June 2007 to 76% compliance \nin December 2007. Note, however, that this is in fact not a decline at all: the standard changed and became more \ndifficult to meet, moving from 15 families and 10 new referrals to 15 families and 8 new referrals. \n  17\n\n \n \n3.  DCF DYFS exceeded the benchmark for the ratio of supervisors to workers. \n \nSupervision is a critical role in child welfare and the span of supervisor responsibility should \nbe limited to allow more effective individualized supervision. Therefore, the MSA also \nestablished standards for supervisory ratios. By December 2008, 95% of all offices should be \nmaintaining a 5 worker to 1 supervisor ratio (MSA Section II.E.20). Like the caseload \nstandards, this standard was to be phased in starting in December 2006. As of December \n2007, 90% of the offices were to have sufficient field level supervisory staff (SFSS2) to \nmaintain a 5 worker to 1 supervisor ratio (MSA Section II.E.14). \n \nAs displayed in Figure 4, the State exceeded the December 2007 target with 98% of the Local \nOffices having 5 to 1 supervisory ratios. Appendix A-5 contains a table with supporting detail \nfor each office, including the number of supervisors at each level. \n \nFigure 4: NJ DCF DYFS Supervisor to Caseload Staff Ratios \n7\n0 Actual: 1 to 5\n- 98%\nc\ne (SFSS2 only)\nD\n7\n0 Target: 1 to 5\n- 90%\nc\ne (SFSS2 only)\nD\n07 Actual: 1 to 5\n- 87%\nun (SFSS2 only)\nJ\n07 Target: 1 to 5\n- 85%\nun (SFSS2 only)\nJ\n70% 80% 90% 100%\n% of DYFS offices meeting standard\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \nNote: 2006 data not included because casework supervisors (SFSS1) and field supervisors (SFSS2) \nwere counted together at that time. \n \n  18\n\n \n4.  DCF DYFS achieved the December 2007 caseload targets set for Adoption staff. \n \nAdoption staff are responsible for finding permanent homes for children who cannot safely \nreturn to their parents by developing adoptive resources and performing the work needed to \nfinalize adoptions. The MSA requires the State to move away from generic permanency \ncaseloads and to ensure that children with a permanency goal of adoption are assigned to \ndesignated Adoption workers (Section II.G). \n \nAs with the Permanency caseloads, by December 2008, the goal is for 95% of offices to have \naverage caseloads for Adoption staff of 15 or fewer children (MSA Section II.G.19). As of \nDecember 2007, 81% of Local Offices are to have average caseloads for Adoption staff of 18 \nor fewer children with a subset of 35% of all offices achieving average caseloads for \nAdoption staff of 15 or fewer children (MSA Section II.G.16). \n \nAs displayed in Figure 5, the State far exceeded the Adoption caseload targets for December \n2007 with 93% of the offices having average caseloads for Adoption staff at or below the \nstandard of 18 children and 71% of the offices with average caseloads of 15 or fewer children. \nThis information was verified by the Monitor using the previously described approach for all \ncaseloads. Appendix A-4 contains a table with supporting detail for each office. \n \nFigure 5: \nNJ DCF DYFS Adoption Caseloads \n-\nDec 07 Actual: 15 children 71%\n-\nDec 08 Target: 15 children 35%\n-\nDec 07 Actual: 18 children 93%\n-\nDec 08 Target: 18 children 81%\n-\nn 7 Actual: 18 children 90%\nu 0\nJ\n-\nn 8 Target: 18 children 60%\nu 0\nJ\n-\nar 7 Actual: 18 children 68%\nM 0\n-\nDec 06 Actual: 18 children 65%\n-\nDec 06 Target: 18 children 35%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \nNote: Prior to Dec 06, Adoption staff & adoption cases were included in permanency caseload data. \n  19\n\n \nB.  Training \n \nConsistent with the past two monitoring periods, and as shown in Table 6, the State has met \neach of its MSA obligations for training during this monitoring period. Given that most of the \nhiring of new caseload-carrying staff and the associated Pre-Service training occurred in the \npast monitoring periods, DCF’s focus has shifted to providing In-Service training to the \nworkforce. The most significant accomplishment, overseen by DCF’s Director of \nAdministration and discussed on page 21, is bringing together a highly expert team to \nformulate and begin the implementation of a unified strategy for training on the new Case \nPractice Model.  \n \nTable 6: Training Compliance with the Modified Settlement Agreement \n# of Staff  Total # of \n# of Staff  # of Staff \nTraining  Trained  Staff \nMSA Commitment  Trained  Trained July-\nType  Jan-June  Trained \nin 2006  Dec 2007 \n2007  CY 2007 \nPre-Service  New caseworkers shall have \nMSA II.B.1.a  160 class hours, including \nintake and investigations \ntraining; be enrolled within  168 \n711  412  1,291 \ntwo weeks of start date;  (98%) \ncomplete training and pass \ncompetency exams before \nassuming a full caseload \nIn-Service  Staff shall have a minimum of \n3,001 \nMSA II.B.2.b  20 hours of in-service training  N/A  3,001 \n(99%) \nannually \nConcurrent  Training on concurrent \nPlanning  planning; may be part of 20  2,522  729  386  3,637 \nMSA II.B.2.d  hours in-service training  \nCase Practice  As of December 2008, case  Trainers (38) \nModel  carrying staff, supervisors and  Exec Mgt (14) \nMSA II.A.3  case aides that had not been  Senior Mgt (40) \nN/A  N/A  200 \ntrained on the new case  Child Welfare \npractice model shall receive  Supervisors \nthis training  (108) \nInvestigations  New staff conducting intake \n& Intake  or investigations shall have \n62 \nMSA II.B.3.a  investigations training and  N/A  650  712 \n(95%) \npass competency exams \nbefore assuming cases \nSupervisory  Newly promoted supervisors \nMSA II.B.4.b  to complete 40 hours of \n65 \nsupervisory training; pass  N/A  114  179 \n(100%) \ncompetency exams within 3 \nmonths of assuming position \nAdoption  Adoption training for  44 \n91  140  275 \nMSA II.G.9  adoption workers  (100%) \n Source: DCF Administrative Data, March 5, 2008 \n \n  20\n\n \nDuring this monitoring period, the Training Academy12 also accomplished the following: \n \n•  Together with the Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group (CWPPG), a master \nschedule to train 4000 staff on the Case Practice Model between November 2007 and \nOctober 2008 was developed and implementation began. \n \n•  Training Academy staff were reorganized by regions to establish better accountability \nmeasures that more clearly define managers’ responsibilities for effective training \ndelivery. \n \n•  A staff person whose role is to collect and monitor training data to ensure compliance \nwith the MSA was assigned, greatly enhancing DCF’s ability to track training \nparticipation. \n \n•  DCF began utilizing the Training Academy website to register staff for training, to \ntake attendance and to post grades. \n \n•  Human Resources and the Training Academy devised a plan to standardize \nhiring/appointments of Supervisors so that supervisory training groups can begin in a \ntimely fashion. \n \n•  The backlog of training rosters was updated to ensure training records are up-to-date. \n \n•  Communication protocols between the Training Academy and the field were \nimplemented to ensure results of examinations during the supervisory modules are \nmore closely linked to staff development. \n \n•  Eight core competencies for frontline Supervisors were identified to be used for \nselection, training and evaluation of Supervisors. \n \n1.  Case Practice Model Training and Support \n \nDuring Phase I of implementation, the MSA requires the Monitor to focus “primarily on the \nquality of the Case Practice Model and the actions taken to implement it.” (Section II.A.5). \nThe previous Monitoring Report described the State’s ambitious Case Practice Model \nImplementation Plan which involves intensive training and implementation support to four \nImmersion Sites with simultaneous roll-out to other areas of the State.13 As previously \ndiscussed, a major focus of the past six months has been the development and implementation \nof training on the new Case Practice Model. By agreement of the parties, the delivery of \ntraining on the Case Practice Model did not begin until November 2007. The Department \n                                                 \n12 The Training Academy is the DCF Division with overall responsibility for training and staff development. \n \n13 Progress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families: Period I Monitoring Report for Charlie and \nNadine H . v. Corzine – January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007. Washington, DC: Center for the Study of Social \nPolicy. October 26, 2007, page 33. \n  21\n\n \nreports that during this monitoring period, the training team delivered 13 days of train-the-\ntrainer sessions at which 38 trainers, 54 executive and senior management staff, and 108 case \nwork supervisors were trained on the new Case Practice Model. These trainers will then \nbecome the engine of the State’s roll-out strategy. \n \n2.  Pre-Service Training \n \nBetween July 1 and December 31, 2007, the State hired 172 case-carrying staff in Family \nService Specialist Trainee (FSST) and Family Service Specialist 2 (FSS) positions. Table 6 \nlists 168 staff (98%) enrolled in New Worker and/or Pre-Service training. Five of the 172 \nstaff did not attend Pre-Service training within two weeks of their start date, but all 172 staff \n(100%) have now been trained. The Monitor reviewed a random sample of 20% of the \ntraining rosters of Pre-Service training classes for the months of July 2007 to December 2007, \ncross-referenced Human Resources records from the same period and concluded that the State \ncomplied with the MSA (Section II.H.1.b). \n \nIn this monitoring period, the Department became almost fully staffed and the number of new \nappointments decreased markedly. The sharp reduction in staff to be trained led the State to \nimplement a new plan in order to better coordinate hiring and the start of Pre-Service training \nto comply with the MSA (Section II H.1.a). Starting in January 2008, FSS trainees are now \nonly able to begin employment on any one of ten monthly hiring dates and new training will \ncommence monthly.  \n \nAs part of the Pre-Service training process, trainees are assessed on knowledge acquisition at \nthe end of each training module. In the last Monitoring Report, the Monitor recommended the \ndevelopment of a standardized statewide process to certify when a trainee is ready to assume a \nfull caseload. The Training Academy developed a Trainee Caseload Readiness Assessment \ntool, which was subsequently approved by Human Resources, the employee union, and the \nMonitor. Since the tool’s implementation in October 2007, the State reports that a survey of \nLocal Offices reveals approximately 108 trainees have been formally assessed using it, with a \nmajority of those trainees meeting the assessment standards. Eight trainees were reported as \n“not ready” to assume a full caseload based on the results of the assessment tool. Those eight \ntrainees were required to spend more time in the Local Office training units and were \nprovided more focused supervisory oversight and conferencing. DCF reports that it continues \nto examine the assessment tool for improvements to ensure consistent system-wide \napplication. \n \n3.  In-Service Training \n \nAs shown in Table 6, 3,001 workers (99%) received at least 20 hours of In-Service training \nduring 2007. As agreed by the parties, much of the training received was tied to the \ndeployment of NJ SPIRIT. The Monitor compared 60 staff transcripts with Human Resource \ndata to verify the State’s data about compliance with the MSA (Section II.B.2.b). \n \n  22\n\n \nThe roll-out of the Case Practice Model training will become the In-Service training \ncomponent for staff during the next calendar year, beginning with training sessions in January \n2008. \n \n4.  Concurrent Planning \n \nAs reflected in Table 6, Rutgers University School of Social Work trained a total of 386 staff \nbetween July 1 and December 31, 2007 on Concurrent Planning. The Monitor cross \nreferenced 10% of staff transcripts with Human Resource data to verify that the State \ncomplied with the MSA (Section II.B.3.d). The Training Academy is planning to meet with \nthe University Partnership to seek ways in which to better integrate Concurrent Planning \ntraining with the training on the Case Practice Model. \n \n5.  Investigations Training \n \nAs reflected in Table 6, 62 new Intake and Investigations staff (95%), including 11 IAIU \nInvestigators received or were scheduled to receive First Responders training in this \nmonitoring period. The Monitor reviewed 32% of First Responders training rosters for this \nmonitoring period and cross referenced them with Human Resources records to determine that \nthe State complied with the MSA (Section II.B.3.a). \n \n6.  Supervisory Training \n \nThe State reports the number of Supervisors appointed during this monitoring period \ndecreased significantly from the past two monitoring periods. During the months of July and \nAugust 2007, five Supervisors were appointed each month and three were appointed in \nSeptember 2007. The State believes the supervisory curriculum works best with a class of at \nleast 12 participants. DCF therefore proposed and the Monitor approved a plan to begin \nSupervisory training once per quarter. This plan means newly appointed Supervisors will \ncommence training within three months of promotion and complete it within six months. The \nMonitor also approved the State’s proposal that if the number of new Supervisors appointed \nin a quarter is fewer than 12, the commitment will be delayed until such time as a class of 12 \ncan be assembled, but in no event will any Supervisor commence training beyond six months \nafter assuming supervisory duties. \n \nAs shown in Table 6, during this reporting period, the State trained 65 new Supervisors \n(100%). Of these 65 Supervisors, 52 were appointed in the last monitoring period and 13 were \nappointed in this monitoring period. An additional supervisor was appointed in this \nmonitoring period who was an experienced supervisor. 12 other new Supervisors were \nappointed at the end of the monitoring period, 3 of whom are experienced Supervisors and 9 \nof whom began training in January 2008. The State provided the Monitor with a detailed list \nof the Supervisors and their promotion and training dates. The Monitor cross referenced 33% \n  23\n\n \nof staff transcripts with Human Resources data and concluded that the State complied with the \nMSA (Section II.B.4.b).14 \n \nIn response to the Monitor’s concerns about staff development, the Training Academy \ninstituted a feedback loop that more closely links the Training Academy staff and the field to \nensure that results of supervisory competency exams better assist Managers and Supervisors \nto develop effective supervisory strategies. \n \nThe Training Academy, in consultation with DCF executive management, identified eight \ncore competencies that reflect the mission, vision and values of the agency, each of which are \nconsistent with the new Case Practice Model. They are: \n \n•  Customer/Client Focus \n•  Cultural Competence \n•  Communication \n•  Guiding and Developing Staff \n•  Coaching \n•  Facilitating Change \n•  Technical/Professional Knowledge and Skills \n•  Organizational Ability \n \nThe State plans to incorporate these eight core competencies into the selection, training and \nperformance evaluation of frontline Supervisors. \n \n7.  New Adoption Worker Training \n \nForty-four staff members (100%) new to the Adoption units were trained during the reporting \nperiod, as shown in Table 6. In total, 184 Adoption workers were trained during the year. The \nMonitor cross referenced 33% of staff transcripts with Human Resources records and \nconcluded that the State complied with the MSA (Section II.G.9). \n \n                                                 \n14 The Monitor reviewed transcripts from those Supervisors who did not complete supervisory training on the \nCase Practice Model by the end of the last monitoring period and determined the Supervisors had completed the \nrequisite supervisory training. \n \n  24\n\n \nC.  Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) \n \nThe Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) is responsible for investigating allegations \nof abuse and neglect in any out-of-home care setting. This includes correctional facilities, \ndetention facilities, treatment facilities, schools (public or private), residential schools, \nshelters, hospitals, camps or day care centers that are licensed or should be licensed, Resource \nFamily homes and registered family day care homes.15 In the last half of 2007, IAIU received \n1532 referrals. Figure 7 below provides the source of referrals for July to December, \nexcluding 122 referrals from August 2007.16 \n \nFigure 7: IAIU Referral Source July – December 2007 \nLegal & Court, 4, 0%\nFacility, \n178, 13%\nParent, 215, 15% Relative, 25, 2%\nPolice, \n77, 5%\nOther, 91, 6%\nDYFS, 54, 4% School, 266, 19%\nHealth, \n82, 6%\nOther Gov't \nAgency, \nAnonymous, \nFriend/\n187, 13%\n115, 8%\nNeighbor/\nCommunity,  Self, 9, 1%\n107, 8%\n \nSource: DCF Administrative Data; excludes data on August 2007 referrals. \n \nThe purpose of IAIU’s investigative effort is to determine whether children in out-of-home \ncare settings have been abused or neglected17 and to ensure their safety by requiring \ncorrective actions to eliminate the risk of future harm.

The IAIU met the target for timeliness of IAIU Investigations. \n \nDCF reported that IAIU Investigators completed 80% or more of all investigations within 60 \ndays during this monitoring period. The Monitor verified this information by reviewing the \npattern of investigations completed in less than 60 days on randomly selected days from July \nto December and for all days in September. Over all these days, the performance ranged from \n80% to 88% of investigations completed within 60 days. For the entire month of September \n2007, 81% of all referrals had investigations completed within 60 days.  \n \nAmong investigations of maltreatment in foster care settings – foster homes and congregate \ncare facilities – IAIU’s performance appears to be slightly better than overall. For example in \nSeptember 2007, IAIU received 253 referrals and, as noted, completed 81% of investigations \nwithin 60 days. Among the 253, 116 (46%) referrals were of alleged maltreatment in foster \nhomes and congregate care facilities. Of the 116 referrals of alleged maltreatment in foster \nhomes and congregate care facilities, a slightly larger portion, 96 (83%) were completed \nwithin 60 days. The Monitor verified this information by reviewing 26 (approximately 20%) \nof the 116 investigations of alleged maltreatment in foster homes or congregate care facilities \ninitiated in September 2007. Twenty-five of the 26 investigations reviewed were completed18 \nin an average of 33 days by February 1, 2008. All of these 25 investigations resulted in \nunfounded allegations. However, some had recommendations for additional training, \ncounseling, or restrictions on the age of children to be placed in the setting. The 25 cases \nreviewed included three investigations that required 63, 67, and 84 days to complete.19 \n \n2.  By December 31, 2007, IAIU had created a Continuous Quality Improvement unit.  \n \nIAIU’s Continuous Quality Improvement unit (CQI) has been in place since July 2006 when \nIAIU was located within the Department of Children and Families.20 The unit is staffed with \none supervisor and four liaisons to each of the IAIU Regional Offices.  \n \n                                                 \n18 Two (2) of the “completed” cases did not have any approval signatures from supervisors or central office. \nThose cases were completed shortly after the transition to NJ SPIRIT and the supervisors apparently relied on \nthe fact that they had electronically approved these cases and did not also sign the paper file copy. \n \n19\nThe one investigation still open after nearly six months involved allegations of sexual abuse in a foster home \nthat the child began disclosing after being returned home and local prosecutors were working on a criminal \ninvestigation. In such circumstances, law enforcement requires that IAIU Investigators suspend completion of \ntheir investigation pending completion of the criminal investigation.  \n \n20 While the CQI unit is operational, overall policies providing guidance for IAIU and the rest of the Department \nregarding IAIU’s role need revision. DCF’s Policy Development Unit (PDU) and IAIU have already begun \ncollaborating on the revision process and PDU has prepared a draft of the updated policies.  DCF targets June 30, \n2008 for the completion of the policy revision process.  \n \n  26\n\n \nThe CQI unit currently reviews all corrective action plans and makes decisions to accept or \nreject the plans. Results are entered into a database that is used for continuous tracking and \nidentification of systemic deficiencies. As of December 31, 2007, the IAIU CQI unit was \nmonitoring 49 corrective action plans.  \n \nIn addition to monitoring and ensuring corrective action plans are implemented, CQI \nresponsibilities21 include: \n \n•  Monitoring Investigation Timeliness and Quality \n \nThe CQI unit participates in monthly reviews of every open IAIU investigation held in order \nto devise strategies and tactics to resolve investigation delays, reduce any existing backlog \nand ultimately improve the quality of investigations. This is referred to as the COMPSTAT \nprocess. \n \n•  Orientation and Training of New IAIU Staff and Feedback to Existing Staff \n \nThe CQI unit conducts an IAIU Business Orientation with all new IAIU staff within two \nweeks of their joining IAIU and may also retrain existing staff when deficiencies have been \nnoted. The orientation covers the following investigative processes: the use of IAIU and \nDYFS forms, investigative interviews, gathering supporting documentation, timeframe \nexpectations, collateral contacts, IAIU policy and best practice, the responsibilities of an IAIU \ninvestigator, explores observation skills and finding overview. CQI staff also shadow new \ninvestigative staff. \n   \nThe CQI unit developed an IAIU Investigation Guide to emphasize investigative practice and \nhas developed investigative tools based on case practice needs (e.g. IAIU Checklist, \nSupervisor Weekly Log, IAIU consultation log, Supervisor Conference Form, IAIU \nReference guide, etc.). In addition, the CQI unit has drafted an investigative training manual \nspecifically for Institutional Abuse Investigations. The draft manual is complete and has been \nsubmitted to the DYFS Training Academy for review. CQI also distributes a quarterly \nnewsletter that captures central office communication, case practice issues, IAIU milestones, \netc. \n \n•  Conducting Safety Assessments \n \nThe CQI unit participates in periodic safety assessments of congregate care facilities with the \nOffice of Licensing (OOL). In calendar year 2007, the CQI unit participated in 3 of these \nsafety assessments and as of March 31, 2008, the CQI unit had participated in 3 safety \nassessments thus far in 2008. During the next monitoring period, OOL and CQI are targeting \ncompleting these reviews on a monthly basis.  \n \n                                                 \n21 It is not clear whether the IAIU CQI unit currently reviews decision-making about referral to IAIU for \ninvestigation and acceptance of cases for IAIU investigation. The Monitor is currently reviewing this issue as \npart of a larger review of the State Central Registry (SCR). \n  27\n\n \n•  Maintaining Data Integrity in Automated Systems \n \nThe CQI unit monitors and corrects, as necessary, NJ SPIRIT information on IAIU \ninvestigations and provides supplemental training for staff regarding NJ SPIRIT data entry. \nThe unit also corrects and updates Safe Measure information, as necessary. \n \nD.  Accountability through the Production and Use of Accurate Data \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the MSA required further development of data capacity in four \nmajor ways: \n \n•  The deployment of Phase II of NJ SPIRIT (NJ SPIRIT Release 3). \n•  The distribution of regular, accurate reports from Safe Measures. \n•  The production of caseload reporting that tracks actual caseloads by office and \ntype of worker and for permanency and adoption workers that tracks children as \nwell as families. \n•  The maintenance of an accurate worker roster. \n \nEach of these is discussed separately below. \n \n1.  Deployment of Phase II of NJ SPIRIT \n \nNJ SPIRIT was deployed statewide in August 2007. The MSA required the deployment of NJ \nSPIRIT Release 3 by December 2007 (MSA Section II.J.12), but the State chose to include \nthe critical functionality in Release 2 Phase 2, which, by prior agreement between DCF, the \nplaintiffs and the Monitor, was deployed statewide on August 22, 2007. To support the \ndeployment, 176 staff were placed in DYFS local offices to assist field workers and 13 staff \nwere stationed to operate a centralized Help Desk. The on-site support was originally intended \nto extend for a total of four weeks. Given the many challenges associated with rolling out an \napplication of NJ SPIRIT’s size and scope, DCF extended the on-site support period to fifteen \nweeks to better assist field workers and mitigate the impact on their work. Additionally, DCF \nprovided supplemental training, increased the number of staff at the Help Desk and shared \nvideo presentations to further assist workers as they transitioned to use NJ SPIRIT in their \neveryday work. While still considerable, the volume of Help Desk tickets opened each day \nhas decreased from an average of approximately 200 each day in August and September 2007 \nto an average of approximately 50-60 each day at the end of December 2007. \n \nDeployment of NJ SPIRIT was met with heightened anxiety in DCF central and Local \nOffices. Conversion to a new data system is fraught with stress. Although there have and \ncontinue to be problems with conversion and field implementation, DCF deserves credit for \nits focus, diligence and efforts to head off problems and then move as rapidly as possible to \nfix them once identified. \n \nThe deployment of NJ SPIRIT began with pre-conversion clean up of the data from the \nexisting legacy information systems to ease the conversion process. The conversion process \n  28\n\n \npresented a significant number of challenges which had to be triaged to address first those \nwith the greatest impact to the frontline staff. DCF has prioritized the changes to be made to \nthe NJ SPIRIT application and is addressing first those which have the greatest impact on \nclients, the field and federal claiming and reporting. Based on the Monitor’s work in other \njurisdictions, these challenges are not unexpected with the roll-out of such a sophisticated \nsystem.  \n \nCreation and implementation of NJ SPIRIT provides New Jersey with increased capacity both \nto support the day-to-day work of the staff in the field and to collect and track data on DCF’s \nperformance. Instead of a largely paper based system where information is handed off to \nclerical support staff for data entry, the overwhelming bulk of the information must now be \nentered by the case-carrying staff. On the whole, staff are becoming more comfortable in \nnavigating and using NJ SPIRIT, but the benefits of NJ SPIRIT have yet to be fully realized \nby the field. \n \nTo position itself better for the next stages of NJ SPIRIT work, in December 2007, DCF \nrestructured, combining several special NJ SPIRIT, technology and data analysis units into a \nsingle unit responsible for information technology (IT) and reporting for all of DCF. The \nsingle unit has five teams: the help desk, the application development group, the infrastructure \nunit, the application maintenance unit and the data analysis and reporting unit. DCF has \napproximately 90 staff employed in the IT and Reporting Unit and continues aggressive work \nto trouble shoot and solve problems and to realize the benefits of NJ SPIRIT for case \nmanagement and data reporting. The creation of the new IT unit has also tightened the \ncommunication between IT and the field. \n \n2.  DCF met its obligation to report from Safe Measures, although that reporting was \nunavailable for a time due to the transition to NJ SPIRIT. \n \nBy August 2007, as required by the MSA, DCF created extensive reporting capacity through \nSafe Measures, a management tool that analyzes the data from DCF’s IT systems and makes \nthe analysis available to workers, supervisors and administrators in the field. (MSA Section \nII.J.9). DYFS administrators have begun to rely heavily on Safe Measures as they focus on \nthe management of caseloads and other initiatives and seek to comply with the MSA \nstandards. There was a gap in access to Safe Measures because it had been configured to work \nwith DCF’s former information system. After the deployment of NJ SPIRIT, Safe Measures \nhad to be reconfigured to work with the new application. DCF and DYFS Local Office \nManagers report that Safe Measures is now functional, but DCF will need to continue to \nensure that issues with the data are addressed in a prioritized and focused manner. \n \n3.  Caseload reporting tracks actual caseloads by office and type of worker. \n \nDCF has been able to generate and provide data to the Monitor with regard to caseloads by \noffice and by type of worker.  \n \n  29\n\n \n4.  DCF maintains an accurate worker roster. \n \nNJ SPIRIT is able to create and track an accurate worker roster. This roster is the foundation \nfor the report used by the Monitor and DCF to assess compliance with MSA caseload \nrequirements.  \n \n  30\n\n \nIV.  CHANGING PRACTICE TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES \n \nA.  Field Launch of the New Case Practice Model \n \nOne of the most significant developments of the monitoring period is the beginning \nimplementation of the Case Practice Model. DCF views the new Case Practice Model as the \ncornerstone of child welfare reform in New Jersey with the potential to create lasting change \nin practice at every level of the Department.  \n \nThe daunting challenge DCF faced was to develop a mechanism to meaningfully train the \nentire workforce on the Case Practice Model. The Department began by focusing on the first \nthree prongs of its six prong approach to system change, explained in detail in the last \nMonitoring Report22, which involve: \n \n1.  Leadership Development \n2.  Statewide Readiness Strategy \n3.  Immersion \n4.  Service Development \n5.  Continued Focus on the Fundamentals \n6.  Enhanced Planning Between DYFS and DCBHS \n \n1.  Leadership Development \n \nThe Department convened a Leadership Summit in October 2007 with the its new training \npartners, the New Jersey Partnership for Child Welfare Program (University Partnership) and \nthe Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group (CWPPG). The Summit provided DCF with an \nopportunity to experiment with the concepts in the Case Practice Model and to share its \nmission across Divisions within DCF. \n \n2.  Statewide Readiness Strategy \n \nThe bulk of work in this reporting period has been devoted to the second prong of the \nDepartment’s system change roadmap: the development of a Statewide Readiness Strategy. In \nNovember 2007, the expert trainers at CWPPG delivered a comprehensive multi-day training \nsession to DCF Executive Management, Area Directors, Local Office Managers and trainers \nthat covered the first module of the Case Practice Model training, Engaging Families and \nBuilding Trust Relationships. Simultaneously DCF, in consultation with CWPPG, developed \na schedule and the infrastructure necessary to deliver the training in the four Immersion Sites \nand statewide. \n \nThe challenges around developing a calendar to train approximately 4000 staff and \ncommunity partners are significant. The Case Practice Model training for staff statewide \n                                                 \n22 Progress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families: Period I Monitoring Report for Charlie and \nNadine H . v. Corzine – January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007. Washington, DC: Center for the Study of Social \nPolicy. October 26, 2007, page 32. \n  31\n\n \nbegins with the module on Engaging Families and Building Trust Relationships and is \nintended to satisfy the Department’s commitment of 40 hours of In-Service training for each \ncase carrying worker and supervisor to have begun in January 2008 (MSA Section II.B.2.c). \nIn-Service training for staff statewide involves over 1100 session days of training. DCF’s goal \nis to have all designated DYFS staff complete this basic training on the Case Practice Model \nin 2008. The training plan anticipates training to be delivered by trainers who are coached, \nassessed and approved by CWPPG. The training process involves a “train the trainer” model \nwhich develops trainers to be part of regional training teams deployed locally to provide \nintensive Case Practice Model training to staff and the community. The regional training \nteams include representatives from the DCF Training Academy, the University Partnership \n(including trainers with a history of delivering family-centered training for DYFS), DYFS \nstaff and CWPPG team members.  \n \nMonitor staff attended one of the three-part training modules entitled Engaging Families and \nBuilding Trust Relationships held in Livingston, New Jersey. The class members included \nArea Directors, casework supervisors, and other administrators. The Monitor found the \ntrainers to be knowledgeable, clear and purposeful. The staff were visibly impressed with the \ncurricula and generally spoke very positively about how they thought such trainings would \nimprove practice. \n \nThe Department is working to link training and practice by forming a Case Practice Model \nTechnical Assistance Group. This group consists of 12 Assistant Area Directors (each \ndeployed locally by area) and four DYFS technical assistance staff (3 positions currently \nfilled) under the direction of the DYFS Deputy Director. DYFS reports that this Technical \nAssistance Group will provide support to the field on the Case Practice Model. DCF reports \nthat it is engaged in providing staff with the knowledge and means to apply what they are \nlearning in training to their daily practice.  \n \n3.  Immersion Sites \n \nNew Jersey selected four Immersion Sites (Bergen Central, Burlington East, Glouster West \nand Mercer North Local Offices) to fully develop new family engagement skills and practices \nthrough intensive training, coaching, practicing and partnering with families. DCF, together \nwith its partners, has created an intensive training and coaching calendar for staff at these four \nImmersion Sites. The intensive training and coaching being employed envisions staff and \nleadership working closely with Area Directors, Assistant Area Directors and local \ncommunity partners to routinely conduct Family Team Meetings which adhere to all critical \nelements (e.g., Assessment, Teaming, and Tracking) of the Case Practice Model in their work \nwith children and families. \n \nIn November and December 2007, DCF sought additional community support for the \nimmersion process by meeting with local judges in immersion vicinages to explain the \nprocess and to invite the judiciary to join the practice change efforts. The DCF Commissioner \nalso met with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and discussed the new Case Practice \nModel and permanency for children. Additionally, the DCF Director of Policy and Planning, \n  32\n\n \nthe Deputy Director of DYFS and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of DYFS Practice \nconvened a day long summit in December 2007 to introduce the Deputy Attorneys General \nwho represent DYFS to the Case Practice Model and the immersion process.  \n \nThe Immersion Sites will receive intensive coaching and training from a curriculum entitled \nDeveloping Strength Based, Individualized Child and Family Practice which has been \nadapted from Utah, a state that has successfully implemented a child welfare reform agenda. \nThe training covers the topics listed in Table 8 below.  \n \nTable 8:  \nDeveloping Strength Based, Individualized Child and Family Practice Training Topics \nDeveloping trusting relationships with children and families \n•  Overview of the skill for building a trusting relationship \n•  Understanding the cycle of need, challenge model and the five stages of change \n•  Working through resistance \n•  Use of solution focused questions \n•  Assessing your relationship with a family \n•  Developing and using a plan to build a trusting relationship \nThe basics of creating and supporting family teams \n•  Identifying the characteristics of a successful team \n•  Assessing team \n•  Conflict management, consensus building and conflict resolution \n•  Introduction to family systems \n•  Family focused interviewing \n•  Family and social network mapping \n•  Identifying and assembling the team \n•  Prepping for the team \n•  Facilitation \n•  Building trust and agreement among team members \n•  Leadership style, validation, cooperation \n•  Five stages of creating a team \n•  Team skills building \nAssessment \n•  Functional assessment \n•  Self assessment \n•  Helping families self-discover \n•  Strengths and needs \n•  Timeline tools \n•  Safety/CPS assessment \n•  Genograms, eco mapping, and family systems mapping \n•  Dual track – assessment and investigation \n•  Quality service reviews and assessing documentation \n•  On-going assessment \n•  Strength and resiliency \nUsing assessment to craft individual plans \n•  Effective planning \n•  Gathering assessments \n•  Practice crafting plans \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning  \n  33\n\n \nAdditionally, during this monitoring period, the State increased the funds available to support \nfamily preservation and reunification through the use of flexible funds for birth families. \nThese increased resources have been allocated to the Local Offices. DCF reports that DYFS \nworkers will be trained on the availability and use of these flexible funds as a part of the Case \nPractice Model Implementation roll-out and immersion  \n \nThe roll-out of the new Case Practice Model will be an ongoing focus of DCF for the coming \nyear and beyond. The Monitor will closely follow its implementation and report on its \nprogress at the field level in the next monitoring period report. \n \n4.  Differential Response and Prevention Efforts \n \nThe MSA requires the case practice model to address the development of individualized \nservice plans built on the strengths and needs identified in a quality assessment of family and \nchild strengths and needs (Section II.A.2.e). To fulfill this commitment, DCF expanded its \ncommunity-based resources to respond to voluntary requests for services from families \nexperiencing a current or developing need that does not pose a safety threat to the children. \nThis alternative response provides services to children and families prior to an allegation of \nchild abuse or neglect. \n \nIn April 2007, DCF awarded contracts under its Differential Response Pilot Program of \napproximately $4.2 million to pilot sites covering Camden, Cumberland, Glouster and Salem \nCounties to engage vulnerable families and provide supportive, prevention services to \npromote healthy family functioning. During the summer of 2007, DCF worked with its \ncommunity partners to train Differential Response staff. Training focused on family \nengagement, interviewing and communicating with families, building family teams and \ndeveloping family plans and family needs assessments. \n \nThe pilot sites use a Differential Response Practice Model that is based on and consistent with \nthe new Case Practice Model. The sites are able to respond to families in a family-centered, \nchild-focused, community-based manner 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Referrals are \ngenerated by the State Central Registry (SCR) primarily through a live, warm-line telephone \ntransfer. Differential Response case workers meet with families within 72 hours of referral \nand family team meetings are held within 10 days of the referral.  \n \nDCF reports that between September 2007 and December 31, 2007, 124 families were \nreferred to the Differential Response initiative in the four counties. Of the 124 families, 111 \n(89%) families accepted services. In Cumberland, Glouster and Salem Counties, the two most \nidentified needs were temporary or emergency financial assistance and mental health services \nfor children. In Camden County, housing, rent, utility or emergency shelter needs were \nidentified most often.  \n \nIn addition to the Differential Response initiative, DCF has expanded the Peace: A Learned \nSolution (PALS) violence prevention program and the Family Success Centers to focus on \nprimary prevention and comply with the MSA (Section II.C.9). In November 2007, well in \n  34\n\n \nadvance of the June 2008 deadline, DCF completed the expansion of the PALS program to \nAtlantic, Monmouth, Ocean and Union Counties as required by the MSA (Section II.C.9), in \naddition to the previously existing capacity in Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, \nHunterdon, Middlesex and Passaic Counties. The PALS program is an evidence-based \ncomprehensive assessment and treatment program model which uses art therapy for children \nand non-offending parents exposed to domestic violence in an attempt to reduce the impact of \ndomestic violence on children, improve child and family functioning and well-being and \nbreak the cycle of abuse for future generations. Each PALS program provides comprehensive \nassessments, child care and/or summer camp, case management, group and individual therapy \nand education support, follow up services and transportation. Each child and family receives \nintensive therapeutic and case management services for six months and follow-up services for \nan additional six months. The PALS caseworker meets with the parent on a weekly or \nbiweekly basis to assist the family with daily living needs and to coordinate the therapeutic \nand supportive services being provided. \n \nDuring the summer of 2007, DCF awarded new funding to twenty-one Family Success \nCenters to provide wrap-around resources and supports for families. Through the Division of \nPrevention and Community Partnerships, DCF also transitioned 11 of its FACES programs to \nFamily Success Centers with a slight increase in funding from existing dollars. These actions \nhave expanded the network to 32 state-supported Family Success Centers in 16 counties. The \nFamily Success Centers offer primary and secondary child abuse prevention services and \nbring together community residents, leaders and agencies to address the problems that lead to \nchild abuse and neglect. The core services of the Family Success Centers include access to \ninformation on child, maternal and family health services, development of strength-based \nplans to address challenges which threaten family stability and safety, provision of income \nsecurity services, connection to other public and private resources, life skills training, parent \neducation and home visitation. These services are available to any family in the community \nwith no prerequisites. In addition, DCF continued its work as a pilot program of the national \nStrengthening Families Initiative (SFI), seeking to prevent child abuse and neglect through \nwork to support families in early care and education settings. \n \n5.  Permanency Planning and Adoption \n \nDCF set specific targets to ensure that the State met the MSA requirement of 1400 adoptions \ncompleted by December 2007. DCF finalized 1540 adoptions by the end of this monitoring \nperiod – 140 adoptions over the target set by the MSA (Section II.G.17). This is a tremendous \naccomplishment and sets a new performance bar for the State, surpassing the previous state \nrecord of 1418 adoptions finalized in 2004. The State attributes its success to the effective \nwork and support of adoption practice units in each DYFS office. The State’s success over the \nlast two years has resulted in a greatly reduced number of children legally free and awaiting \nadoption – from 2,260 on January 1, 2006 to 1,295 on December 31, 2007. \n    \nIn addition, special Adoption Impact Teams, described in more detail in the last Monitoring \nReport, worked hard in their search for permanency for the 100 youth in foster care who have \n  35\n\n \nbeen waiting the longest to be adopted.23 DCF reports that three of these youth have been \nsuccessfully adopted and another twenty-five are close to permanency through adoption or \nkinship legal guardianship. Seventy-one of these youth are included in the exhibit created by \nthe Heart Gallery of New Jersey, a travelling photography exhibit of youth awaiting adoption. \nThe Department succeeded in having the exhibit profiled in People Magazine, giving the \nHeart Gallery a wider distribution network to attract more interest in the youth waiting to be \nadopted. DCF is now working with two local newspapers, the Star Ledger and the Asbury \nPark Press, to feature waiting children on a regular basis.  \n \nWork is also proceeding toward developing a permanency planning practice that is more \nconsistent with the new Case Practice Model. Previous Monitoring Reports24 have described \nDYFS’s development and implementation of its Concurrent Planning Model which continues \nto be pilot-tested in 10 sites across the state. The Model, common in many jurisdictions across \nthe country, is designed to work with families simultaneously on both a reunification strategy \nand a back-up strategy for permanency in the event reunification fails. \n \nAn important component of New Jersey’s Concurrent Planning Model involves permanency \nplanning case reviews when children have been in care for 5 months and again at 10 months. \nFive month reviews are critical meetings with all participants in a family’s DYFS case, \nincluding parents, children, service providers and caseworkers. The focus is on how the team \nis progressing towards the goals of the case plan, what DYFS can do to assist the family, and \nwhether the current goals still meet the children’s needs. Ten month reviews are similar and \nare held in preparation for Family Court permanency hearings. Table 9 below provides a \nbreakdown of the number of 5 and 10 month reviews completed in the 10 pilot sites between \nJuly 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007 for children who entered placement as of September 1, \n2006. In this monitoring period, DCF reports 87% of five month reviews due and 88% of ten \nmonth reviews due were completed timely. Table 9 also reports the number of cases \ntransferred from a Permanency worker to an Adoption worker within 5 days of a permanency \ngoal change to adoption, a process described in detail in the MSA (Section II.G.2). The \nadoption cases were transferred timely 100% of the time in half of the pilot sites, with an \naverage compliance rate across the 10 sites of 64%. \n                                                 \n23 Progress of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families: Period I Monitoring Report for Charlie and \nNadine H . v.

APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS AND SERVICES FOR CHILDREN \n \nA.  Resource Families \n \nDCF has made exceptional gains in its recruitment and licensure of Resource Families \n(kinship, foster and adoptive caregivers) over the past year. The structural and substantive \nchanges within the Department appear to have paid off. In 2007, DCF licensed 1367 new non-\nkin Resource Family homes, far exceeding the MSA requirement to license 1071 non-kin \nResource homes between January 2007 and December 2007 (Section II.H.12). This resulted \nin a 50% increase in licensed Resource Family homes over 2006 performance and almost a \n100% increase over 2005 performance. \n \n1.  DCF recruited and licensed 1367 new non-kin Resource Families in 2007, far \nexceeding its mandate to license 1071 non-kin Resource Family homes in this period.  \n \nThe State licensed a total of 1367 non-kin Resource Family homes in 2007. The MSA \nrequired that the State license 1071 non-kin Resource Family homes between January and \nDecember 2007 (Section II.H.12).  \n \nFigure 10: \nNumber of Newly Licensed Non-Kin Resource Family Homes by Calendar Year \n1600\n1400 1367\n1200\nes 1067 1071\nm\no\nH\ner  1000\nost\nF\nn \nKi 800\nn-\no\nN\nof \ner  600\nb\nm\nu\nN\n400\n200\n0\nCY 2006 CY 2007 Target CY 2007\nYear\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n \n  38\n\n \nThe State also licensed 529 Kinship Resource Family homes in CY 2007 to reach a total of \n1896 new homes (kinship and non-kinship) licensed in CY 2007. Figure 10 below provides \ndata on the number of kinship and non-kinship homes licensed each month.  \n \nFigure 11: \nNew Licensed Family Resource Homes (Kinship and Non-kinship) \n January 2007-December 2007 \nTotal Licensed in 2007 = 1896 Homes \n300\n250 241\ns\ne\nm\no\nH\nurce  200 196\no\nes 172\nmily R 166 163 161 153 149\na 150 141\nF 134\ned  124\ns\nn\ne\nc\nof Li 100 96\ner \nb\nm\nu\nN\n50\n0\nJan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 May-07 Jun-07 Jul-07 Aug-07 Sep-07 Oct-07 Nov-07 Dec-07\nMonth\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n \nIn looking at data on Resource Family homes, it is also critically important to assess net gains \nin the number of licensed Resource Family homes. An overall net increase of homes is \nrequired to sustain DCF’s goal to ensure an increasing number of children are placed in \nfamily-based settings. In CY 2007, DCF achieved a total net gain of 829 Resource Family \nhomes. As seen in Figure 12 below, large net gains occurred between January and July 2007. \nDuring the summer months as staff focused time and effort on training on the new data \nsystem (NJ SPIRIT) and on implementing a new licensing information system, the net gains \ndecreased.  \n \n  39\n\n \nFigure 12: \nNet Gain of Resource Families January-December 2007 \nTotal Net Gain = 829 Homes \n195\n175\n175\n155\n135\n122\n115\n101 102\nn\nai\net G 95 86\nN 78\n75 67\n58\n55\n41\n35\n15\n5\n-5 -4 -2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nJan- Feb- Mar- Apr- May- Jun- Jul- Aug- Sep- Oct- Nov- Dec-\nMonth\n \n Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n \nThe Monitor reviewed a random sample of approximately 20% of licensing files from January \n2007 to December 2007 and verified reported DCF data. Consistent with the last monitoring \nperiod, DCF’s Resource Family Support and Resource Family Licensing units have achieved \nimpressive results. Influenced by new targeted training, the continued work of the Resource \nFamily Impact Teams and the changes to licensing protocols which eliminate unnecessary \nbarriers for families, the Department has accomplished a great deal and is to be lauded for its \nwork in this area.  \n \n2.  The State made progress on timely processing of Resource Home Applications but did \nnot meet the target to complete the licensing review process and make licensing \ndecisions within 150 days. \n \nThe Department has continued to use Resource Family Support Impact Teams (Impact \nTeams), which made significant gains towards reducing the backlog of Resource Family \nhome applications in the last monitoring period, to diagnose and develop strategies to \ncomplete the licensing review process and to make decisions on applications within 150 days \n(MSA Section II.H.4). This requirement was not met although improvements in the process \nhave occurred and continue. Based on a sample of July 2007 applications for licensure, and as \nshown in Figure 13 below, DCF was successful in meeting the 150 day licensing requirement \n  40\n\n \nfor 25% of those homes, 29% of the homes took between 150 and 180 days to make a \ndecision on the application and 46% of the homes took more than 180 days. \n \nFigure 13:  \nTime from Application to Completion of Licensing Review Process and Decision for \nFamily Resource Home Applications  \n(For Homes that Applied for Licensure in July 2007) \nLicensing Review Process \nand Decision in 150 Days\n25%\nLicensing Review Process \nand Decision Pending \nBeyond 180 Days\n46%\nLicensing Review Process \nand Decision in 151-180 \nDays\n29%\n \nSource: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n \n \nBeginning in April 2007 and ending in July 2007, the Impact Teams working together with \nArea Resource Family Specialists, Licensing Inspectors and the Office of Resource Family \nSupervisor, completed an intensive process in which any application statewide pending over \n150 days was conferenced at least once a month.  \n \nAs a result of this work, the Impact Teams recommended additional structural and practice \nchanges which were implemented beginning in September 2007. These recommendations \ninclude: \n \n•  Assigning four Office of Resource Family Case Practice Supervisors to four \ndifferent geographical areas of the state. These staff members were tasked to work \nintensively with each Resource Family Unit on all applications approved since \nJanuary 2007 and pending 60 days or more. \n  41\n\n \n \n•  Continuing monthly conferences with the Licensing Inspector, Resource Family \nSupervisor, the Area Resource Family Specialist and all members of the unit. \nThese conferences focused on reaching a resolution on each pending study within \n150 days and identifying issues that delay the process. \n \nThe Impact Teams also concluded that some offices needed more intensive work than. \nMoving forward, four Local Offices and one private agency conducting home studies have \nbeen identified for more focused assistance. \n \nDCF believes that additional progress is possible in increasing the percentage of Resource \nFamily homes licensed within 150 days, though some families will always require more time \nto move through the licensing process. Other efforts the State has undertaken to increase \ncompliance of the 150 day licensing process include enhancing its contract with Foster and \nAdoptive Family Services (FAFS) to provide six resource family advocates to support \nprospective and existing Resource Families in Monmouth/Middlesex, Camden, Essex, Union, \nHudson and Bergen/Passaic areas and continuing to hold meetings of Area Resource Family \nSpecialists and Office of Licensing Staff to review policy and discuss challenges.  \n \n3.  The State has a usable database of current and available Resource Family homes. \n \nIn the last monitoring period the State, as part of its development of NJ SPIRIT, created a \ntracking system to provide a real time database of current and available Resource Family \nhomes as required by the MSA (Section II.H.9). The Monitor recently observed this tracking \nsystem, and witnessed how, within minutes, staff are now able to obtain names of open homes \navailable for placement. The system can display the number of children in prospective homes, \ntheir history with the Department, their ages and backgrounds. It can also provide staff with \ninformation on each Resource Family home and the home’s history with the Department. This \ntracking system has the potential to significantly improve the timeliness with which potential \nResource Family homes are identified and should assist in better matching children’s needs \nwith the capacities and skills of available resource parents.25 \n \n4.  The State created a methodology for setting annualized targets for Resource Family \nnon-kin recruitment based on a needs assessment by county.  \n \nThe methodology the State has created to set targets for Resource Family non-kin recruitment \ntakes into account many factors and is focused on recruiting homes that meet the priority \nidentified needs of the Department to keep sibling groups together in placement and to place \nchildren closer to their home communities and schools. \n \n                                                 \n25 Although an accurate database and tracking system have been developed, the use of the automated system by \nLocal Office staff for placement matching is reportedly still inconsistent; some staff continue to rely on memory \nand manual card files of available Resource Family homes. Over the next monitoring period, the Monitor will \nexamine more closely how the tracking system is used in daily operations. \n  42\n\n \nDCF does not believe it has an overall statewide net capacity issue, but is appropriately \nfocused on the geographic distribution of homes, the ability to keep sibling groups together \nand the need to continually replace homes lost to the system due to permanency decisions and \nattrition. As of December 2007, the existing licensed resource home capacity would \naccommodate 15,712 children, many more than the 9,200 children who were in placement at \nthat time. Given these objectives, DCF established a target for newly licensed homes for 2008 \nof 1,528 homes, which includes newly licensed kinship and non-kinship homes. \n \nThe State’s methodology for establishing the target of 1,528 newly licensed homes takes into \naccount four factors: \n \n•  The replacement rate (i.e. the number of homes that need to be replaced as a result \nof home closures); \n•  An analysis of Resource Family home capacity compared to sibling group \nplacement rates, given goals for keeping sibling groups together established by \nPhase II of the MSA; \n•  An analysis by county of Resource Family home capacity and demographic factors \nwhich will impact DCF’s ability to meet MSA standards for placement proximity; \nand \n•  The state’s desire to set targets for both kinship and non-kinship homes with the \nresult that staff will be recognized for recruiting kinship as well as non-kinship \nhomes. The State will report on both sets of numbers. \n \nWith regard to sibling group placement, the State believes the largest need is for homes that \ncan accommodate sibling groups of 5 or more children. As of December 2007, there were 16 \nhomes statewide licensed for 5 or more children. The State has estimated a need for an \nadditional 12 homes with this capacity in order to attain targets for intact sibling placements. \nDCF reports that its data suggest that kinship homes are the most successful source of large \ncapacity placements. The State has set a target by December 30, 2008 for 28 homes with a \ncapacity to serve of 5 or more children with a focus on homes in Essex, Mercer, Monmouth \nand Ocean counties. \n \nWith regard to geographic proximity of homes to communities from which children are \ncoming into placement, the State examined licensed home capacity against placement \npopulation in each county, the intact sibling placement rates, non-kinship placement rates, \nkinship placement rates, and proximity. It concluded that while overall capacity is sufficient, \nbest practice suggests a different distribution by county as follows: \n \n•  8 counties have excess capacity that the State utilizes for other counties with less \ncapacity. The State intends to maintain those numbers for placements in and out of \nthose counties. \n•  5 counties have adequate capacity, but targets will be set for a small net increase to \nensure a safety net. \n•  8 additional counties need a net increase of licensed homes beyond the net increase \nachieved in 2007 to meet the placement needs of children in that county. \n  43\n\n \n \nTable 14 below lists each county and classifies them in three ways: Increase for those counties \nwhere a significant net increase in available homes is needed; Improve for those counties \nwhich currently have adequate supply, but will seek to create modest additional capacity; and \nMaintain for counties which currently have excess capacity but will need to recruit and \nlicense to accommodate turnover and attrition.  \n \nTable 14:  \nRecruitment Licensing Categories by County for FY 2008 \n \nCounty  Status \nCape May \nCumberland \nEssex \nHudson \nIncrease \nMercer \nMonmouth \nOcean \nSalem \nBergen \nCamden \nMiddlesex  Improve \nPassaic \nUnion \nAtlantic \nBurlington \nGloucester \nHunterdon \nMaintain \nMorris \nSomerset \nSussex \nWarren \n    Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Policy and Planning \n \n \nAccording to the State, each of the targeted counties has analyzed its own challenges and will \nbe pursuing strategies to meet the targets the State has set.  \n \n  44\n\n \n5.  Creating targets for both Kinship and Non-kinship Recruitment  \n \nThe MSA and the State placed a primary focus in 2007 on achieving a net increase of non-\nkinship Resource Family homes. However, New Jersey data shows the rate of kinship \nplacements are now declining. At the same time, national data increasingly suggests that there \nare improved permanency and stability outcomes for children placed with kin. The State \nbelieves that the MSA and internal targets for new non-kinship resources in 2007 may have \nhad an unintended consequence of communicating a lower priority for the licensing of kinship \nhomes. As a result, DCF will separately track and publish data on the number of kinship and \nnon-kinship homes licensed, but set Area and Statewide targets that represent the total of both \ncategories.  \n \n6.  Regulatory Changes \n \nThe Monitor has observed and the State has confirmed that often unnecessarily rigid \nregulations delay or deny a family from becoming licensed even though that family could \nprovide a safe and appropriate home for children in DCF’s custody. During this monitoring \nperiod, the State began to address this issue by drafting changes to the Resource Family \nregulations. To inform that effort, DCF conducted a series of focus groups and discussions \nwith existing and potential Resource Families and key advocates, analyzed current practice \nand reviewed best practices from across the nation. \n \nThe existing Resource Family regulations were adopted in 2005 and are based on the State’s \nconstruction code from the 1970s. The most significant series of proposed changes relate to a \nnew approach to assess a potential Resource Family home’s physical space. The changes in \nthe regulations focus more on the quality of life provided by the space, as opposed to the rigid \nsquare footage or ceiling height restrictions from the construction code. The draft also \nmodifies the existing regulations, which state that no person living in the house may sleep in \nan unfinished attic or basement to make it clear that no child may do so.26 DCF also added \nclarifying language needed to ensure safety. For example, the existing regulations mandate \nthat pools meet local ordinances, but DCF found in practice that those ordinances were \ninconsistent. Thus, DCF added language that requires that pools be enclosed with a barrier \napproved by DCF licensing inspectors. All of the changes are intended to ensure safety while \npermitting the use of safe and appropriate homes previously barred by the existing \nregulations.  \n \nA draft of the regulations has been prepared and is currently in final review by DCF. The \nreview is expected to take no more than 45 days at which time the regulations will be \nsubmitted to the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law for publication. DCF anticipates \nthe new regulations will be published in the June 16, 2008 New Jersey Register and are \nexpected to be effective after the conclusion of the 60-day comment period on August 15, \n2008. \n                                                 \n26 DCF had found in practice that some promising Resource Family homes were eliminated for licensure because \nan adult student coming home from college or an adult relative who wanted to accommodate a kinship placement \nwas sleeping in a basement, even though the child was not impacted. \n  45\n\n \n \n7.  DCF continues to close the gap between current Resource Family Support rates and \nthe USDA’s estimated cost of raising a child. \n \nThe MSA (Section II.H.15) requires the State to close the gap between current Resource \nFamily support rates (foster care, kinship care, and adoption subsidy) and the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture’s estimated cost of raising a child over a several year period. New \nResource Family support rates which move to close the gap became effective January 1, 2008 \nand are included as Appendix B. \n \n8.  Preventing inappropriate use of shelters for children entering foster care. \n \nThe MSA requires the State to eliminate the inappropriate use of shelters for youth entering \nfoster care. The only appropriate uses of shelters are: “(i) as an alternative to detention, or (ii) \na short-term placement of an adolescent in crisis which shall not extend beyond 45 days; or \n(iii) a basic center for homeless youth” or when there is a court order. (MSA Section II.D.8). \nFurther, beginning in July 2007, shelters were not to be used as a placement option for \nchildren under the age of 13 (MSA Section II.D.7). DCF developed policy to support these \nplacement restrictions in the late spring of 2007. Memos outlining these restrictions were sent \nto Area Directors and Local Office Managers on May 2, 2007 with reminders sent on June 6, \n2007. \n \nA concrete impact from the implementation of these new policies has been that a number of \nshelters have been forced to close and several of those which have remained open report a \ndecrease in the number of children referred for shelter placement. DCF senior management is \nworking to adjust the shelter capacity to meet the decreased need. \n \nDCF reports there were a total of four children statewide under the age of 13 who spent time \nin a shelter during the monitoring period, less than .07% of the 6,049 children under 13 in out-\nof-home placement as of December 31, 2007. The lengths of stay for the 4 children were 1 \nday (1 child), 4 days (2 children) and 16 days (1 child). Three of the four children were placed \ndirectly by the Special Response Unit (SPRU) in one county and DCF has addressed the issue \nto prevent reoccurrence. The fourth child was placed in a shelter due a court order. \n \nAs of February 28, 2008, DYFS had contracts with 28 shelters across the state. Currently, \nDCF is unable to provide the Monitor with aggregate data as to utilization and length of stay \nfor these shelters. Additionally, according to DCF, there were 423 children over the age of 13 \nwho spent time in a shelter placement during the monitoring period. DCF reports 332 (78%) \nof the 423 children met the criteria for an appropriate shelter placement under the MSA. DCF \nreports that the older youth, those aged 18-20, are most often being placed in shelters. DCF \nhopes that recent investments in expansion of transitional housing resources will help provide \nbetter placement alternatives for these youth. Due to data limitations, DCF is unable to report \nthe length of stay of these youth in the shelter placements. \n \n  46\n\n \nThe Monitor visited one shelter in transition (Angel’s Wings in Trenton) and one \nshelter/diagnostic treatment center (Grace Hall in Newark) in preparation for this report. \nAngel’s Wings is licensed as a shelter placement as a part of the Anchor House Shelter \nProgram, but has modified its program to provide family-based emergency care utilizing a \nhouseparent model. This change occurred because of the new DCF prohibition on placing \nchildren under age 13 in a congregate setting. Angel’s Wings is now contracted for two \nhomes to serve children, but is currently only operating one due to decreased demand. During \nthe Monitor’s site visit, Angel’s Wings’ Director and staff commented on the advantages and \nchallenges of providing a family setting for emergency care. They positively cited their recent \nability to keep sibling groups together on an emergency basis while longer term placement \noptions were developed for these children.27 \n                                                 \n27 Angel’s Wings reported placement of 38 children, during the monitoring period, whose lengths of stay ranged \nfrom one to 45 days. Of these 38 children, 26 were members of (12) sibling groups.  \n  47\n\n \nVI.  MEETING THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN \n \nA.  Improving the Behavioral Health Services and Delivery System \n \nA new permanent Director of the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS) was \nappointed in November 2007. DCBHS is responsible for finding appropriate home and \ncommunity-based services and/or out-of-home placements for all children and youth in New \nJersey who are experiencing emotional and behavioral challenges and are in need of \nbehavioral or mental health services. DCBHS continues as a free standing child behavioral \nhealth system focusing on improving access to and the quality of behavioral health care \nachieved in part through a redistribution of existing resources and introduction and \nprocurement of new, high quality resources.  \n \nSome youth involved with DCBHS are also involved with other systems, such as DYFS and \nthe Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). Under the MSA, DCF, through DCBHS, \nis required to minimize the number of children in DYFS custody placed in out-of-state \ncongregate care settings and work to transition these children back to New Jersey (Section \nII.D.2).  \n \n1.  The number of children placed out-of-state for treatment continues to decline. \n \nDCF has made steady progress in reducing the number of children in DYFS custody placed \nout-of-state.28 The majority of children placed out-of-state have experienced significant \nmental health challenges and are placed out-of-state following attempts to find an appropriate \nplacement in New Jersey. As of December 31, 2007, 235 children were placed out-of-state \nand as of March 7, 2008, the reduction continued and DCF reports that there were 213 \nchildren placed out-of-state (See Figure 16).  \n \nIn addition to implementing strategies to move children to in-state treatment options, DCBHS \nhas dramatically reduced the number of children newly placed out-of-state. Table 15 shows \nthe number of new out-of-state placements authorized for children and youth in DYFS \ncustody during this reporting period.  \n \n                                                 \n28 In some cases placements made out-of-state are in locations closer to the child’s community than alternative \nin-state placements. \n  48\n\n \nTable 15: Out-of-State Placement Authorizations by DCBHS \nJuly - December 2007 \nNumber of authorizations for youth in DYFS \nMonth  custody (total number of DCBHS  \nout-of-state authorizations) \nJuly    10  (19) \nAugust    6  (15) \nSeptember    1   (3) \nOctober    0   (8) \nNovember    6   (8) \nDecember    0   (2) \nTOTAL   23  (55) \n Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Family Services, DCBHS \n \nThe ability to reduce new out-of-state placement has been made possible by continued \nexpansion of treatment resources within the State. The resource creation work is continuing. \nDCBHS reports that by June 1, 2008 additional therapeutic, community-based programs \nhousing up to five youth each will be added to the array of services available to children, \nyouth and families in New Jersey. DCBHS issued an RFP in November 2007 and has selected \nproviders for approximately 43 youth; these new placement and service options will serve to \nprevent out-of-state placements and provide for youth who are returning to the State from \nmore restrictive placements.  \n \nIn addition to employing strategies to prevent out-of-state placement through resource \ncreation and through careful review and service planning for new requests for out-of-state \nplacement, DCBHS has begun to examine the circumstances of each child currently placed \nout-of-state and is developing and implementing individualized plans for children to return to \nNew Jersey and their community. This initiative began with a focus on DYFS involved youth. \nCase conferences were scheduled, beginning in September 2007, throughout the state and \nconducted with significant input from DCF partners in each county to identify appropriate \nprograms and/or community services needed to return the child to the state. The Monitor \nattended one of the case conferences and was impressed by the team approach to placement \ndecision-making and the purposefulness of the participants. As a result of these conferences, \nas of February 20, 2008, 45 children have returned to New Jersey or have been reunited with \nfamily members out-of-state. DCBHS, DYFS and the involved county partners should be \ncommended for their collaboration and the local relationship building achieved through this \ncase conference process. Figure 16 depicts the reduction in out-of-state placements over time. \n  49\n\n \nFigure 16:  \nChildren in Out-of-State Placement June 2007 through February 2008 \n350\n305\n300\n292 289\n282\n277\nn\ne\nhildr 250 244 235\nC 229\nof  220\nr  213\ne\nb\nm 200\nu\nN\n150\n100\nJun-07 Jul-07 Aug-07 Sep-07 Oct-07 Nov-07 Dec-07 Jan-08 Feb-08 Mar-08\nMonth\n \nSource: DCBHS administrative data, February 29, 2008. \n \nAdditionally, DCBHS has begun to review a small subset of non-DYFS involved youth, \nspecifically the 16 youth residing at Kids Peace, a facility in Pennsylvania, with the longest \nlength of stay. Five of the 16 were reviewed by February 6, 2008 and the other 11 were \nexpected to be reviewed by the first week of March 2008. DCBHS intends to continue to use \nthe case conference process to reduce the number of children being sent out-of-state and to \nreduce the length of stay for those children for whom a placement resource cannot be found in \nNew Jersey.  \n \n2.  Providing mental health expertise in DYFS offices \n \nIn October 2007, DCBHS redeployed Child Behavioral Health Team Leaders to DYFS Area \nOffices to serve as experts in the behavioral health system of care and on local resources. The \ngoal of this change was to improve coordination between DYFS local staff and DCBHS in \nmeeting the needs of DYFS-involved children with mental and behavioral health needs. This \ndecision has drawn mixed reaction across the state. DYFS staff are generally pleased by the \ngreater access to the knowledge of DCBHS resources. Some local system of care partners, \nincluding Care Management Organizations (CMOs) and Youth Case Management \nOrganizations (YCMs) are worried that this organizational shift has diminished the broader \nsystem of care coordination function of the Team Leaders. Eventually, the Team Leaders will \n  50\n\n \nassume responsibility for the case conferences discussed above on all children placed out-of-\nstate and for inter-divisional coordination of service provision to children. DCBHS anticipates \nthat these planning conferences will be conducted on a quarterly basis with the third review \ncycle to begin in mid-March 2008. \n \nIn April 2008, additional licensed behavioral health clinicians will be hired by Care \nManagement Organizations and deployed to DYFS’ Case Practice Model Immersion Sites in \nBergen, Gloucester, Mercer, and Burlington counties. DYFS Area Office Directors will \nparticipate in the selection process for these professionals, who will work collaboratively with \nChild Health Units and take responsibility for supporting the development of behavioral \nhealth plans for children. DCBHS is targeting December 31, 2008 for each local office to \nhave clinicians proportionate to the number of children served by that office. \n \n3.  Finding placements for detained DYFS youth \n \nAs described in the last Monitoring Report, DCF created a systematic process to identify and \ntrack youth in juvenile detention facilities who remain in these facilities solely because they \nare awaiting appropriate placement. Under the MSA, no youth in DYFS custody should wait \nlonger than 30 days in detention post-disposition for an appropriate placement (Section \nII.D.5). According to DCF, 17 youth in DYFS custody and in detention were awaiting \nplacement from July 2007 to December 2007. Of the 17 youth awaiting placement (12 male; 5 \nfemale), one youth exceeded the 30 day requirement and was not placed until 48 days post-\ndisposition. 29 \n \nTable 17 below provides information on the length of time each of these youth waited for \nplacement. \n \nTable 17:  \nYouth in DYFS Custody in Juvenile \nDetention Post-disposition Awaiting Placement \n   \nLength of waiting time  Number of Youth \n \n0-15 days  5 \n16-30 days  11 \nOver 30 days  1 \nSource: DCF, January 2008 DCBHS summary update \n \n                                                 \n29 Although DCBHS identified that the youth’s placement was available within the 30-day requirement, the court \nordered that the youth remain in detention until the youth was medically cleared for transfer to placement. \n  51\n\n \n4.  Funding Evidence-Based Treatment and Services \n \nUnder the MSA, the State was required to seek approval from the federal government for a \nMedicaid rate structure “to support the use of new services for children and families, \nincluding community-based and evidence-based informed, or support practices, such as \nFunctional Family Therapy and Multi-Systemic Therapy” (Section II.C.2). As previously \nreported, DCF determined that these practices could be funded within the existing New Jersey \nMedicaid State Plan and federal government approval was not required. In October 2007, \nDCF issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to support providers of Multi-systemic Therapy \n(MST) and Functional Family Therapy (FFT), both of which have proven efficacy with youth \ninvolved in the juvenile justice system in other jurisdictions and have also proven effective for \nyouth with challenging behaviors involved with other systems. Twenty-eight responses were \nreceived. Awards are expected to be announced by the end of April 2008. Contracts are \nexpected to be executed by June 30, 2008.  \n \nB.  Building a Health Care Delivery System for Children in Placement \n \nRedesigning the delivery system and increasing the quality of health care services to children \nand youth in out-of-home care are key obligations under the MSA (Section II.F.8). Like other \nMSA reform efforts, the improvement of health care service delivery to children and youth in \nfoster care requires a thoughtful and staged process with continuous feedback to ensure that \ngoals are met and to make adjustments to planning as needed. As previously reported, DCF \nundertook a deliberative process to build a new comprehensive health care model.  \n \nIn May 2007, DCF released their vision for providing comprehensive coordinated health care \nto children and youth entering or in out-of-home care.30 With the new coordinated health care \nplan, modifications were made to the manner in which comprehensive medical examinations \nwill be delivered; plans were made to build children’s medical health units and significantly \nexpand the number of nurses in local DYFS offices; the intended use of Regional Diagnostic \nTreatment Centers was clarified; and efforts continued to ensure that pre- placement \nassessments were provided in non-emergency settings. \n \n1.  Providing Comprehensive Medical Examinations  \n \nUnder the MSA, the State is required to provide all children entering out-of-home care with \ncomprehensive medical care. Services the State has committed to provide include: \n \n•  pre-placement assessment,  \n•  a comprehensive medical examination within the first 60 days of placement,  \n•  medical exams in accordance with federal Early and Periodic Screening, \nDiagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) guidelines,  \n•  semi-annual dental exams,  \n                                                 \n30 New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Coordinated Health Care Plan for Children in Out-of-Home \nPlacement, May 22, 2007. http://www.nj.gov/dcf/DCFHealthCarePlan_5.22.07.pdf  \n  52\n\n \n•  mental health assessments for children with suspected mental health needs, and  \n•  any follow-up care needed by a child (MSA, II.F.2).  \n \nDCF determined that there were many challenges to the previous Comprehensive Health \nEvaluation for Children (CHEC) approach as the intended vehicle to comprehensively assess \nthe health care needs of all children and youth entering out-of-home care.31 \n \nBased on a review of capabilities of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), it was \ndetermined that some FQHCs and other providers had the capacity to comprehensively serve \nchildren and youth, but that providing all components of the desired comprehensive medical \nexam would require the health centers to partner with other providers for particular parts of \nthe exam; for example, mental health assessments. A Request for Proposal (RFP) published in \nJune 2007 provided for flexibility in such partnerships and was designed to increase the \nnumber of providers available statewide to provide comprehensive medical exams. A bidders’ \nconference was held in July 2007 and additional questions emailed to DCF were answered \npublicly on the DCF website. In September 2007 DCF received responses from nine agencies \ninterested in providing the required services outlined in the RFP. In December 2007, DCF \nmade initial awards to six agencies with the expectation that the centers would be operational \nby March 2008. These agencies will add to the provider network by offering services to \nchildren in Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Union Counties thereby \ndoubling the existing number of providers performing comprehensive medical examinations. \nDCF’s focus continues to be on ensuring and increasing capacity within counties lacking \nCHEC providers. \n \n2.   Creating Child Health Units \n \nA key component of DCF’s strategy to improve health services and outcomes for children in \nits care is the creation and staffing of Child Health Units in every Local Office. This strategy \nhas been well received by social work staff as a key support to their work. \n \nDCF had previously contracted with the Francois Xavier Bagnoud Center (FXBC) within the \nSchool of Nursing at University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey to staff offices in 14 \ncounties and Professional Nurse Consultants to staff the remaining seven counties. However, \nduring this Monitoring Period, DCF signed a Memorandum of Understanding with FXBC to \nbegin rolling out Child Health Units in each of the local DYFS offices; FXBC has now \nassumed responsibility for the entire state.  \n \nThe Child Health Units will work to improve coordination, case management and \ndocumentation of health care for children in out-of-home care. These Units build on the \nexisting nursing model, which placed a nurse in every local office to perform nursing \nassessments and assist DYFS caseworkers. The staffing level for each new Child Health Unit \n                                                 \n31 For fuller discussion of problems with the CHEC approach see: Office of the Child Advocate, Needs and \nAssets Assessment of the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for Children (CHEC) Program December 19, 2005 \nand Office of the Child Advocate, Needs and Assets Assessment of the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for \nChildren (CHEC) Program October 3, 2007. \n  53\n\n \nis tied to the number of children the particular DYFS office has in out-of-home placement. In \naddition to the nurse already assigned to the local office, each Child Health Unit will have \nstaff based on the following ratio: 1 Nurse Health Care Case Manager per 50 children in \nplacement and 1 Staff Assistant per 100 children in placement.  \n \nAs the Child Health Units become operational, FXBC staff conduct health audits to determine \nthe existing health care needs and provision of care for children in placement and to inform \nstaffing needs. In conducting the audits, nurses review each child’s DYFS case record, \nMedicaid claims information and immunization history to assign a child/patient acuity level. \nFXBC has adapted a tool utilized by the state of Utah’s Fostering Healthy Children Program32 \nto assess a child’s health and health care needs at the time of removal from his/her home and \nat regular intervals during placement to determine the level of nursing case management \nneeded. Acuity levels range from Level 1 (well-child) to Level 6 (untreated complex health \nissues or unknown health history/child newly entering care). This method allows FXBC to \nassign balanced caseloads to its nurses and provides baseline data for DCF. DCF and FXBC \nanticipate that children’s acuity levels will decrease or stabilize with the provision of health \ncare case management services by the Child Health Units. This measurement can be also be \nused to evaluate the efficacy of the Child Health Units. As of February 20, 2008, FXBC had \ncompleted health audits for over 1600 children and youth across 7 counties. DCF and FXBC \nexpect to be able to share preliminary aggregate data from these audits with the Monitor by \nApril 2008. The Monitor will report on this data in the next Monitoring Report. \n \nCurrently there are fully functional Child Health Units in Sussex and Hunterdon Counties. \nThe CHU in the Sussex County office became functional in January 2008 and is staffed by \nthree nurses, a Clinical Nurse Coordinator, two staff assistants, and an MSW Intern. The \nMonitor visited this site in February 2008 and met with CHU staff to learn about its operation. \nThe Sussex County office is a relatively small office with approximately 100 children in \nplacement. Most of the staff are familiar both with DYFS and outpatient pediatric and \nadolescent health care provision. The combination of skilled staff and a smaller office has \nenabled a focus on the implementation of procedures and protocols to enhance the functioning \nof the CHU. Some of these procedures and protocols will be adapted for use in other Local \nOffices. FXBC management is very involved and familiar with day-to-day planning for \nbringing other CHUs on-board; cognizant of what may be standardized across the state as \nwell as what may have to be adjusted for local implementation. Current reported challenges to \nimplementing CHUs across the state include recruiting nurses and working within a short \ntimeframe for start-up and full implementation. DCF and FXBC provided information about \nplans for preliminary staffing in other counties this fiscal year and staffing projections through \nDecember 2008. (See Table 18). \n \n                                                 \n32 Utah Department of Health, Fostering Healthy Children Program, http://health.utah.gov/cshcn/FHCP \n \n  54\n\n \nTable 18: \nNurses and Nurse Staff Assistants Hired for Child Health Units \nas of December 31, 2007 and Planned through December 2008 \nCounty  Nurses as of  Nurse Staff  Projected Hires through \nDecember  Assistants as of  December 2008 \n31, 2007  December 31,  Nurses      Nurse Staff \n2007  Assistants \nAtlantic  3  1  6  4 \nBergen  3  5  9  5 \nBurlington  2  0  8  5 \nCamden  4  0  16  8 \nCape May  1  0  3  2 \nCumberland  2  0  7  4 \nEssex  8  9  43  22 \nGloucester  2  0  5  4 \nHudson  5  5  14  9 \nHunterdon  2  0  1  1 \nMercer  2  0  10  5 \nMiddlesex  5  1  11  7 \nMonmouth  3  0  11  7 \nMorris  3  1  4  4 \nOcean  3  0  12  7 \nPassaic  3  2  10  5 \nSalem  1  0  4  2 \nSomerset  1  0  3  2 \nSussex  1  2  2  2 \nUnion  4  1  16  9 \nWarren  3  0  3  2 \nTOTAL  61  27  198  116 \nSource: DCF administrative data, March 20, 2008 \n \n3.  Supporting Regional Diagnostic Treatment Centers (RDTCs) \n \nCurrently, DCF works with four Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (RDTCs) and \none satellite office to assist in the evaluation of children who are or may have been victims of \nphysical, sexual or emotional abuse or severe neglect. In the spring of 2007, DCF reached \nagreement with the RDTCs on revised guidelines for referrals from DYFS and RDTCs \nreporting back to DYFS. Processes were standardized across RDTCs such as types of cases to \nbe referred, timeframes for scheduling appointments, and time frames for the production of \nreports. Program descriptions for each site were revised and individualized.  \n \nIn 2007, DCF significantly expanded investment in the RDTC system, funding an additional \nhalf-time position at the Jersey Shore Medical Center, the site serving Ocean and Monmouth \nCounties, and offering to add physician capacity at two other RDTCs as follows: increasing a \npart-time position at St. Peter’s University Hospital in New Brunswick which serves \nMiddlesex, Somerset, Mercer, Hunterdon, and Union counties to a full-time position and \n  55\n\n \nadding a position at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center which services Essex and Union \ncounty. As of March 11, 2008, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Peter’s University \nHospital and the CARES Center at UMDNJ each have a vacant physician position as the \nresult of staff resignations. \n \nThese steps are attempting to address longstanding concerns about the financial viability of \nthe RDTC system as well as to anticipate an increase in appropriate referrals from DYFS. \nReimbursement for physical abuse/physical neglect and sexual abuse medical exams \nincreased 100%, from $300 to $600 per exam; chart reviews increased from $400 to $600; \nand the reimbursement rate for psychosocial assessments is $1300. Steps have also been taken \nto improve communication and coordination between DYFS and the RDTCs. DYFS liaisons \nto the RDTC are assigned to train and provide information to DYFS staff about their RDTC, \ntrack referrals and troubleshoot issues. In the next monitoring period, the Monitor plans to \nmeet with liaisons and staff who have contact with RDTCs and visit RDTCs to learn firsthand \nabout the impact of improvement efforts and any outstanding concerns.  \n \n4.   Conducting Pre-Placement Health Assessment \n \nUnder the MSA, all children entering out of home care are required to have a pre-placement \nassessment and beginning in June 2007, 90% of children entering out-of-home placements \nmust have pre-placement assessments in a setting that is not an emergency room (Section \nII.F.7). Nurses in local DYFS offices continue to conduct pre-placement assessments during \nbusiness hours. In Bergen and Passaic counties, nurses adjust their work hours to be available \nbeyond business hours or “after hours” to conduct assessments. Statewide, workers also \naccess children’s primary care providers to conduct pre-placement assessments. DCF reports \nthat from July 1, 2007 – December 31, 2007, 11% (229 of 2113) of children entering care had \na pre-placement assessment in the office of their primary care physician. In Camden and \nEssex counties, screenings are conducted beyond business hours or “after hours” by Youth \nConsultative Services and FXBC, respectively. According to DCF, emergency rooms are used \nto provide pre-placement assessments only under exceptional circumstances such as when the \nchild is already at the emergency room prior to the initial report to DYFS. Combined, these \nstrategies helped meet the goal as set forth in the MSA (Section II.F.7). As shown in Table 19, \nDCF reports that all children entering placement received a pre-placement assessment. In \naddition, on average, ninety percent of all children in out-of-home care received their pre-\nplacement health assessments in a non-emergency room setting during this monitoring period. \n(See Table 19). By the end of 2008, as information captured in NJ SPIRIT is mapped against \nSafe Measures, DCF expects to be able to present more specific data about pre-placement \nscreenings, such as the number of assessments conducted beyond 24 hours post-placement. 33 \n \n                                                 \n33 Under special circumstances a child may receive a pre-placement assessment within 24 hours of placement if \nit is determined that this is in the child’s best interest. \n  56\n\n \nTable 19: \nCompletion of Pre-Placement Health Assessments  \nand Use of Emergency Rooms for Assessments \nJuly –December 2007 \nMonth  Number of  Number of Pre- Percentage of  Percentage of \nChildren  Placement  Pre-Placement  Pre-Placement \nEntering Care  Assessments  Assessments  Assessments \nCompleted  Completed  Completed in \nNon-ER Setting \nJuly  379  379  100%  92% \nAugust  394  394  100%  92% \nSeptember  259  259  100%  90% \nOctober  399  399  100%  88% \nNovember  362  362  100%  90% \nDecember  320  320  100%  85% \nTOTAL  2113  2113  100%  Average: 90% \nSource: DCF, Healthcare Pre-placement Assessment Update, January 2008, not independently verified by \nMonitor. \n \n5.   Compiling Medical Records and Creating Health Passports \n \nAll children entering placement are to have a medical record created for them. The record is a \ncompilation of all relevant medical information. As the CHUs are rolled out across the state, \nthe CHU nurses will be responsible for ensuring that the records are created and updated \nregularly. In Sussex County, for example, Staff Assistants are assigned the responsibility of \nassembling the CHU medical record with information gathered from numerous sources \nincluding NJ SPIRIT, DYFS records, and medical records. CHU nurses review the \ninformation assembled; obtain further necessary information; schedule initial health \nexaminations; assist in scheduling other needed medical and related appointments; track to \nensure completion of other needed medical and related appointments; ensure the appropriate \nflow of health information to and from providers; and provide support to the child’s medical \nhome by coordinating and collaborating with DYFS staff, caregivers, other community-based \nproviders, the child/youth, family members, and caregivers. \n \nCurrently, the information from the medical record is not entered into NJ SPIRIT. DCF and \nFXBC are in the process of updating NJ SPIRIT screens to be compatible with the forms \nbeing used by the nurses. All nurses have been trained on NJ SPIRIT, but currently use a \nseparate electronic database for storage of information. \n \nIn addition to the medical record, a Health Passport is to be created for each child and given to \nparents, children (if age appropriate), and caregivers. Children’s caregivers are to receive an \nup-to-date Health Passport upon the child’s placement or within three days of placement. A \nform downloaded from NJ SPIRIT presently functions as the Health Passport. DCF is \nworking with UMDNJ/FXBC to edit the form for better use by caregivers. \n  57\n\n \n6.  Providing For Children’s Dental Care \n \nNew Jersey still faces significant challenges in building capacity for dental care for children \nin its custody. The Monitor previously reported the lack of dentists willing to accept Medicaid \nas a barrier to DCF in providing for children’s dental care. As of January 1, 2008, New Jersey \ninvested an additional $6 million dollars annually to increase fee-for-service Medicaid \nprovider rates for pediatric dentistry. As a result, fee-for-service dentists will see payments \njump from $18.02 per exam to $64 per exam. However, 85% of children in DYFS custody in \nout-of-home placements are enrolled in Medicaid HMOs, which have difficulty recruiting \ndentists who will accept the Medicaid managed care reimbursement rate applicable to those \nchildren. The fee for service increase does not yet significantly impact them.  \n \nAdditionally, New Jersey has created a statewide “Access to Dentistry” workgroup which will \nfocus in 2008 on determining and removing barriers to access to dental care. DCF’s \nparticipation in this work group is integral to increasing dental access for children in out-of-\nhome care. DCF’s expansion of CHEC providers also provides opportunities to expanded \ndental care capacity. Three of the CHEC new providers either have in-house dental services or \nreferral processes in place.  \n \n7.  Reporting on Additional Health Care Indicators \n \nDCF expects to be able to provide data by April 2008 on five of the eight health care \nindicators agreed upon in 2007. These five indicators are: \n•  completion of pre-placement assessment,  \n•  completion of comprehensive medical assessments within 60 days of a child’s entry \ninto care,  \n•  annual medical examinations in compliance with EPSDT guidelines for children in \ncare for one year or more,  \n•  semi-annual dental examinations for children ages 3 or older in care 6 months or \nmore; and  \n•  children are current with immunizations \n \nThe Monitor and the State are in the process of determining how and when baseline and \nperformance data will be made available on these other three indicators: \n•  mental health assessments for children with a suspected mental health need, and  \n•  receipt of timely, accessible and appropriate follow-up care and treatment to meet \nhealth care and mental health needs; and \n•  children’s caregivers receive an up-to-date Health Passport upon placement or within \nthree days of placement. \n \n \n \n  58\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

Commissioner Guhl is \nresponsible for the welfare of all children in need of public assistance, care, support or protection \nwho reside in New Jersey; for overseeing the administration of DHSj and for ensuring that DYFS, \n\nand the private agencies with which DYFS contracts, comply with all applicable federal and state \nlaws\"pursuant to §§ 30: 1,2 and 30: 1,12 of New Jersey State Institutions and Agencies Law. \n21.

This is an action pursuant to 42 United States Code § 1983, alleging violations of \nthe United States Constitution and federal statutes.  This court has jurisdiction over the federal \nclaims pursuant to 28 United States Code §§ 1331 and 1343 (a)(3). \n23.  Venue in this district is proper pursuant to 28 United States Code § 1391 (b) \nbecause the claims arise in the district. \nINTRODUCTION \n24.  This is a civil rights action against officials of the New Jersey Division of Youth \nand Family Services (the \"Division\" or \"DYFS\"), the Department of Human Services (\"DHS\"), \nand the State of New Jersey (collectively, the \"defendants\"), on behalf of all children who are or \nwill be in the custody of the Division (the \"plaintiffs\"). \n25.  The defendants' systemic failure to protect these children and provide them and \nr \ntheir families with legally required services has/ jeopardized their health and safety, and subjected \n~ights \nthem to significant harm,! in violation of their  under the United States Constitution and \nfederal statutes. \n26.  Many children are being left by DYFS in homes where they are abused and \nneglected, and even killed, while those children who are removed from dangerous situations and \nplaced in foster care spend a substantial part of their childhood growing up in government \n,3-\n\ncustody subject to additional deprivations in a poorly managed and grossly overburdened child \nwelfare system. \n27.  As a direct result of defendants' pattern of actions and inactions, New Jersey's \nchild welfare system is rife with systemic deficiencies that prevent it from meeting constitutional \nand statutory requirements. \n28.  Defendants have not provided the leadership, resources and support necessary to \nensure that the child welfare system complies with the law and provides adequate protection and \nservices to New Jersey's most vulnerable children.  Many DYFS administrators lack the ability, \nsupport and resources necessary to engage in appropriate problem~solving or long~term, strategic. \nplanning on the Division's behalf.  They cannot and do not provide necessary, professional \nguidance and support to their subordinates.  There has been turnover in both the leadership of \nthe agency and the corps of front~line caseworkers, jeopardizing even the Division's most basic \nfunctions. \n29.  The plight of children served by DYFS and the Division's systemic deficiencies \nhave been extensively documented.  In response to mounting concerns that children were being \nvictimized in a system required to protect them, defendant Governor Christine Todd Whitman \nappointed a Blue Ribbon Panel of professionals involved with the child welfare system, including \nsocial services administrators and service providers, lawyers and court personnel, children's \nadvocates, and medical experts, to take public testimony around the state and to analyze \ndocumentary evidence concerning the New Jersey child welfare system.  The Blue Ribbon Panel's \nFinal Report (the \"Blue Ribbon Panel Report\")was issued on February 20, 1998, and concluded \nthat New Jersey's child welfare system had been seriously damaged by years of cut~backs and \nneglect.  The Report identified vast problems at every point in the child welfare process and \nconcluded that the overall capacity of DYFS has been reduced to a crisis mode of intervention. \nThe Report confirmed a decade of reports and child welfare data issued by such organizations as \nthe Association for Children of New Jersey (\"ACNJ\") and the Child Welfare League of America \n(\"CWLA\").  DYFS failures have also been widely reported in the New Jersey press. \n\n30.  Defendants have thus been well aware of their systemic, ongoing failure to \nadequately serve the children who depend on them for their health, their safety, and their lives. \nAlthough defendants have engaged in superficial reform efforts, many areas for which aggressive \nreform is needed have not been addressed by management, and few meaningful changes have \nresulted.  The deprivations experienced by New Jersey's most vulnerable children have only \nworsened significantly over time, leading to the unlawful and sometimes desperate conditions \nprevailing today. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n31.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 (a) & \n(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n32.  The plaintiff class includes the approximately 9,250 children who are in the legal \nand/or physical custody of the Division and children who will be in its custody. \n33.  The plaintiff class is sufficiently numerous.  There are approximately 9,250 \nchildren in the custody of DYFS.  Joinder of all class members is impracticable. \n34.  The questions oflaw and fact raised by the named plaintiffs' claims are common to \narid typical of those raised by the claims of the putative class members.  Each named plaintiff and \neach putative class member is in need of child welfare services, must rely on defendants for the \nprovision of those services, and is harmed by the Division's systemic failures to adequately provide \nsuch services. \n35.  Common questions of fact include: \na.  whether defendants fail to provide children in their custody with safe, \nsecure foster care placements, as required by law and reasonable professional standards; \nb.  whether defendants fail to provide foster children with legally required \nservices, consistent with reasonable professional standards, necessary to prevent them from \ndeteriorating physically and psychologically while in state custody, including but not limited to \nappropriate medical and educational services; \n36.  Common questions oflaw include: \n~5~ \n\na.  whether defendants' actions and inactions violate plaintiffs' rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nb.  whether defendants' actions and inactions violate plaintiffs' rights under \nthe Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as Amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of \n1996,42 United States Code §§ 622 (b)(9) , 671 (a)(18), 674(d). \n37.  The legal claims alleged by the named plaintiff children are typical and \nrepresentative of those of the putative class.  In addition, the harms suffered by the named \nplaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by all class members. \n38.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nThey are represented by attorneys employed by Children's Rights, Inc., a privately funded, non~ \nprofit organization with extensive experience in complex class action litigation involving child \nwelfare systems, and by attorneys associated with the law firm of Lowenstein Sandler P.c. who \nhave extensive experience in child welfare and civil rights litigation.  Plaintiffs' counsel have the \nresources, expertise and experience to prosecute this action. \n39.  Each named plaintiff child appears by a next friend, and each next friend is \nsufficiently familiar with the facts and circumstances of the child's situation to fairly and \nadequately represent the child's interests in this litigation. \n40.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \nmaking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole appropriate and \nnecessary.  Counsel for the plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class. \nSTRUCTURE OF THE NEW JERSEY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n41.  The Division of Youth and Family Services (\"DYFS\") of the Department of \nHuman Services (\"DHS\") is the agency established by the State of New Jersey to investigate \nreports of suspected child abuse and neglect; provide necessary services to children and families \nand protect children who are the subject of such reports; investigate and assess requests for child \nwelfare services and, where appropriate, provide such services; manage cases accepted for service \nby developing, reviewing, revising, and implementing case plans, and provide services to children \n\nand families in accordance with their case plan; provide proper care to children in state custody; \nand secure permanent placements for children in custody.  Defendants Governor Christine Todd \nWhitman, DHS Commissioner Michele K. Guhl and DYFS Director Charles Venti are \nresponsible for ensuring that DYFS carries out its mandates. \n42.  DYFS is legally required to maintain, on a 24~hour daily basis, an emergency \ntelephone service for receiving allegations of abuse and neglect.  These calls are answered by \nChild Protective Services \"screeners\" who are responsible to elicit relevant information from the \ncaller, document it, and assess the response necessary.  After hours, calls are screened by the \noffice of Child Abuse Control. \n43.  When a screener determines that a report of abuse or neglect warrants a child \nprotective service investigation, or a request for services warrants a visit by DYFS, the referral is \nforwarded to an Intake Unit, or, after hours, the Office of Child Abuse Control or a Special \nResponse Unit (\"SPRU\"), located in DYFS district offices.  DYFS has at least one district office in \nevery county of the State.  Intake workers are required to respond to reports referred to them by \nconducting an investigation within the time frame mandated by statute, and conducting a child \nwelfare service assessment. \n44.  If a DYFS worker determines that a child's health and safety is in imminent \ndanger, the worker may remove the child from his home with or without the consent of the \nparent.  If the child is removed without consent, DYFS is required to immediately file an abuse or \nneglect complaint with the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court (\"Family \nCourt\").  A child may also be removed from the home, by order of the Family Court, or a parent \nmay voluntarily place a child with DYFS under a voluntary placement agreement, which is \nrequired to be approved by the Family Court.  Pursuant to such a voluntary agreement, DYFS is \nobligated to return the child at the parents' request or seek a Family Court order to continue the \nout~of~home placement. \n45.  If, following an investigation, an intake worker determines that a child is not in \nimminent risk of harm, but that the family is in need of child welfare services, the family's case is \n\n\"opened\" and becomes a part of the \"generic\" case load of a district office caseworker.  That \ncaseworker is obligated to develop a case plan for the family, to ensure that the family receives \nthe services identified in the case plan, to modify the case plan when appropriate, and to monitor \nthe family. \n46.  If a child is removed from her home and placed in DYFS custody, her case is \nassigned to a district office case worker.  A child may be placed in either a relative's home, a \nfoster home, a shelter, a group home, or a residential treatment facility (\"RTF\").  In the event \nthat an appropriate placement cannot be immediately located for a child because the child was \nremoved after hours, he or she is placed in a temporary emergency placement on a nightly basis. \n4 7.  For a child placed outside her home, the district office in the county where the \nchild is placed assumes case planning and case management responsibilities over the child and \nthe placement.  These responsibilities include developing and updating as necessary the child's \ncase plan with the required elements; ensuring that the child and foster family are receiving \nservices set out in the case plan within the time frames established by the plan; and, making \nface~to~face and other regular contacts with the foster child. \n48.  If a child is placed in a district different from where the child was removed, the \ncase is then dually managed.  The district where the child is placed assumes the duties described \nabove, while the district where the child was removed has responsibility over providing services \nand supervision to the birth parent and in ensuring visitation between the child and the birth \nparent. \n49.  All children placed out of their homes under DYFS are monitored by citizen \nreview boards called Child Placement Review Boards (\"CPRBs\"), overseen by the Family Courts \nand located in each county. \n50.  Once adoption is identified as a child's case goal, his case is forwarded from the \ndistrict office to one of five regional Adoption Resource Centers (\"ARCs\").  An adoption case~ \nworker then takes over the case management responsibilities.  Regional ARCS are responsible for \nfinalizing adoptions by pursuing termination of parental rights or voluntary surrenders of custody \n\nand consents for adoption, and placing the child in an appropriate adoptive home.  Complaints to \nterminate parental rights are filed with the court by Deputy Attorneys General. \n51.  The Division also has a Central office which includes a training and staff \ndevelopment unit, a quality assurance unit, a Bureau of Licensing newly responsible for certifying \nfoster homes, and four Regional offices which include regional foster care units, and regional \nInstitutional Abuse Investigation Units (\"IAIUs\") which investigate reports of abuse and neglect \nin DYFS placements. \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n52.  Defendants are violating statutes and legal obligations that create an overall \nscheme to regulate the provision of child welfare services to children entitled to them. \n53.  The applicable constitutional standards and federal statutes establish a broad \nrange of general and specific duties that defendants are failing to meet in administering the state's \nchild welfare system. \nThe United States Constitution \n54.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees to \neach child in state custody the substantive due process right to be free from harm and the right to \nconditions of custody reasonably related to the purpose of custody.  The right to be free from \nharm encompasses the right to treatment in accordance with reasonable professional standards, \nand the right to the services necessary to prevent children from deteriorating physically, \npsychologically or otherwise while in state care, including but not limited to safe, secure foster \ncare placements, appropriate monitoring and supervision, case planning and management, \npermanency planning and medical, psychiatric, psychological and educational services. \nThe Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as Amended by the \nInterethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996 \n55.  The Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as Amended by the Interethnic \nAdoption Provisions of 1996, requires that public agencies engage in aggressive efforts to recruit \n\npotential foster and adoptive parents who reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the children for \nwhom such foster and adoptive placements are needed.  The Act prohibits defendants from \ndenying any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or a foster parent on the basis of the \nrace, color or national origin of the child or adoptive or foster parent and prohibits the delay or \ndenial of the placement of a child for adoption or into foster care on that same basis. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nA.  CHARLIE AND NADINE H. \n56.  Plaintiffs Charlie and Nadine H. are siblings from Mercer County, who will soon \nbe eleven and nine years old, respectively, and who desperately want to be adopted.  When they \nwere removed by DYFS from their mother's custody because of abuse and neglect, they were \nplaced by DYFS in a foster home where they were again neglected and abused, including being \nbeaten with broomsticks and curtain rods.  They remained in that home, under DYFS \nsupervision, for close to five years.  Although Charlie and Nadine's plan has been adoption for at \nleast the last four years, DYFS has yet to seek or secure an appropriate permanent home and has \ncurrently suspended its adoption placement efforts.  While Charlie and Nadine wait to be \nadopted, they have been placed in a \"temporary\" foster home, and are suffering continued \nemotional harm. \n57.  Charlie and Nadine's father is deceased.  Charlie, Nadine and their older \nhalf~sister were removed by DYFS from their mother in 1994 after she attempted to drown \nthree~year~old Nadine in the bathtub.  Charlie and his half~sister were able to pull Nadine out \nfrom their mother's grasp. \n58.  DYFS placed Charlie and Nadine in foster care with their father's estranged wife, \nMrs. H., in Trenton.  DYFS planned to have Charlie and Nadine adopted by Mrs. H., even \nthough Mrs. H. was ill~equipped to care for any child and it soon became obvious that she was \nalso neglectful and abusive. \n\n59.  Mrs. H. had uncontrolled diabetes and ulcers in her feet, and had difficulty \nwalking.  She was also prescribed medication for psychiatric problems.  She often screamed at the \nchildren and beat them with whatever was available. \n60.  By 1996, Mrs. H. also had an alcoholic and physically abusive live,in boyfriend \nwho beat Charlie.  The boyfriend previously spent six years in prison for a sexual offense \ninvolving his own child.  When Mrs. H. was hospitalized for several weeks due to a diabetic \ncoma, Charlie and Nadine were left by DYFS in the home with Mrs. H's abusive boyfriend. \n61.  Calls to DY  FS reporting the deplorable condition of the home and that the \nchildren had nothing to eat were not adequately investigated by DYFS. \n62.  Mrs. H's home was consistently dark, malodorous and littered with garbage, cat \nfeces and dirty laundry.  When the only toilet in the apartment backed up, Mrs. H. never cleaned \nup the feces left in both the bathroom and the kitchen.  The children slept on mattresses without \nbedding or sheets and with broken windows in their rooms, even in wintertime.  The walls had \ngaping holes and the electrical wiring was exposed.  Syringes for Mrs. H.'s insulin shots were \nlittered all over the apartment.  The children could not bathe in the bathtub because it was full \nof cockroaches.  The Division's only response to numerous complaints made on behalf of the \nchildren was to conduct a home visit, before which Mrs. H. would enlist the help of others to \nclean her foyer and living room.  No inspection of the rest of the home was ever made by DYFS, \nnor did DYFS ever offer Mrs. H. assistance in making the living conditions more appropriate, \nsafer and less dangerous for the children. \n63.  Even though Mrs. H. was unable and unwilling to participate in therapy and failed \nto make progress regarding her poor parenting, the Division's goal for Charlie and Nadine \nremained adoption by Mrs. H. throughout 1997. \n64.  In 1998, a sergeant in the Trenton Police Department who knew the children and \nMrs. H. through his church, requested and attended a meeting with DYFS personnel to present \ninformation on the abuse and neglect Charlie and Nadine were suffering in Mrs. H.'s home.  He \npresented photographs of the home, a sample of syringes that littered the home, and copies of \n,11, \n\nnotes and documents he had begun to keep the previous year of his many interventions in the \nhome on behalf of the children. \n65.  DYFS acknowledged t~at they were aware of some of these issues and agreed to \nhave the sergeant meet with a DYFS supervisor regarding his concerns.  The sergeant was later \ntold that the meeting would not take place and that Mrs. H. 's planned adoption of Charlie and \nNadine was proceeding. \n66.  Shortly thereafter, Mrs. H and the children were evicted and they moved into \nanother apartment.  The home quickly became as filthy as the last one.  Mrs. H. continued to put \noff most home visits by DYFS and a therapist.  Mrs. H. took the children to the dentist for the \nfirst time in more than four years under pressure from DYFS because of the pending adoption.  In \nthe meantime, DYFS continued to fail to protect the children from abuse and neglect. \n67.  That summer, neighbors repeatedly called the police to Mrs. H.'s home.  Mrs. H. was \noften heard screaming at the children, and admitted beating them with curtain rods and a metal \nruler.  The Division's Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (\"IAIU\") investigated the home, but \ntook no action. \n68.  A few months later, in September 1998, Mrs. H. beat the children with a bucket. \nNadine hit her head on the toilet seat, breaking the seat, while Charlie tried to protect his sister. \nMrs. H. called the police sergeant and left a recorded message telling him repeatedly that she was \ngoing to kill the children if he did not come for them.  When the sergeant arrived, Mrs. H. told \nhim to \"get them out of here; I can't stand to see them.\" The next day, DYFS placed both \nchildren in a \"temporary\" emergency foster home, where they have been for almost one year. \n69.  Five-and-a-half years after coming into DYFS custody, and two years after their \nmother's parental rights were terminated, Charlie and Nadine understand that their current \nplacement can only be temporary.  They are still waiting to find a stable and loving family that \nwill adopt them. \n70.  DYFS has failed to take necessary steps to seek and secure an appropriate adoptive \nfamily for these children.  The police sergeant and his wife have been involved in Charlie and \n\nNadine's lives for five years and are interested in adopting both of them.  On March 1, 1999, they \nspoke to a DYFS adoption screener about doing so.  DYFS has yet to take any action to \ninvestigate and approve them as a potential adoptive family, nor has it found another family for \nthese children. \n71.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Charlie and Nadine have \nbeen and continue to be irreparably harmed.  Charlie and Nadine both have significant \nemotional and behavioral problems due to their previous history of chronic abuse and neglect, \nboth at home and in foster care.  Both children are placed in special education classrooms \nbecause of their behavior.  Charlie and Nadine do not know whether they will ever be placed \nwith an adoptive family, or when that decision will be made.  Although Charlie and Nadine have \nformed attachments in their present foster home, they know that the placement is temporary. \nDespite the fact that they have been the Division's responsibility for over five years, these young \nchildren continue to be deprived of the opportunity for healthy development and a normal \nchildhood in a safe, permanent family, subjecting them to further emotional harm. \n72.  Defendants have violated Charlie and Nadine's constitutional and statutory rights \nby failing to protect them from harm; by failing to provide necessary services and an appropriate \npermanent placement to these children once they entered foster care; by failing to make timely \nand meaningful casework contacts and monitor.their progress in foster care; by failing to \ninvestigate their foster home before approving their placement in that home and failing to \nannually evaluate and review that home; by placing them in a foster home that was not safe or \nsecure; by failing to remove them from an abusive and neglectful foster home even though DYFS \nknew or should have known that they were being abused and neglected; by failing to treat them \nin accordance with reasonable professional standards; by failing to provide them with services \nnecessary to prevent them from deteriorating while in state custody; by failing to ensure that they \nreceived proper medical attention or psychological or psychiatric or other foster care services \nwhile in DYFS custody; by failing to provide appropriate management and supervision while \nsupervised by DYFS; by failing to provide case planning and management in accordance with \n\nreasonable professional standards; and by failing to develop and implement a viable permanent \nplan that will allow them to leave foster care and secure a safe and appropriate permanent home, \nall of which are required by law and by reasonable professional standards. \nB.  JASON, JENNIFER and PATTI W. \n73.  Jason, Jennifer and Patti W., ten, eight and six years old, respectively, are siblings \nwho were removed from their neglectful mother and have been in foster care for three years. \nDuring that time they have been in several different foster homes, and Patti has now been \nseparated from Jason and Jennifer.  DYFS is planning to have the children placed for adoption \neven though their father has had an ongoing relationship with his children and is able and willing \nto care for them. \n74.  All three children were initially placed by DYFS in a Cape May foster home where \nthey resided for a year, during which time the children contracted ringworm and impetigo, a \ncontagious skin condition.  Following this placement, the children were moved first to one \nBurlington County foster home and then to another.  Patti was removed from this second \nBurlington County home because of behavioral problems.  She was subsequently replaced with \nthe first foster family, but has been recently removed from that home as well. \n75.  DYFS has long been aware that Jason, Jennifer and Patti's father wants to provide \na home and care for his children, and has told him that he could assume custody of the children \nif he did not live in a trailer that is too small to accommodate them.  In the past three years, \nDYFS has simply advised the father to apply for federal housing, which he has done and for which \nthere is a years~long waiting list.  They also referred him to a program for homeless families, even \nthough the program could not help him because he is not homeless. \n76.  In the last three years, DYFS has attempted to send Jason, Jennifer and Patti's case \nto an Adoption Resource Center (\"ARC\") on five separate occasions to terminate their father's \nparental rights.  The ARC rejected the case the first four times, deciding that where housing was \nthe only obstacle to reunification, termination of parental rights was unwarranted. \n\n77.  DYFS has again sent Jason, Jennifer and Patti's case to ARC, where it has now \nbeen accepted.  The Division's current plan for the children is to terminate their parents' rights \nand to attempt to place the children for adoption. \n78.  Jason and Jennifer remain separated from not only their father, but also from their \nsister Patti.  Despite the Division's long~standing plan to have these children placed for adoption, \nDYFS has taken no steps to secure an appropriate adoptive family for them.  All three have been \nplaced repeatedly with foster parents who are unable to adopt them. \n79.  Three years after Jason, Jennifer and Patti were removed from their mother, who \nwas found to have neglected them and has since missed many visits with her children, DYFS has \nyet to file a petition to terminate her parental rights. \n80.  Jason, Jennifer and Patti visit with their father only once every two weeks, even \nthough DYFS policy states that parental visits should occur at least once a week unless thera~ \npeuticallyharmful.  Additionally, the visits arranged by DYFS require Jason and Jennifer to miss \nvirtually one complete day of school every two weeks, even though reasonable alternatives are \navailable. \n81.  Jason, Jennifer and Patti each have special needs.  DYFS has taken no steps to \nensure these needs will be met.  Jason needs speech therapy which DYFS refused to take steps to \nprovide.  Jennifer suffers from adjustment disorder likely due to the instability of her situation, \nand also requires weekly treatment from a behavior therapist.  She is not receiving these services \nbecause DYFS has not taken the steps to endure they are provided.  Patti is not only \ndevelopmentally delayed, but also is speech and language delayed.  Patti has been characterized \nby doctors as very apprehensive.  Following a disruption in her placement, Patti began to vomit \ndaily.  All of these conditions require therapy, and DYFS has not taken steps to ensure that the \nneeded therapies are being provided. \n82.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Jason, Jennifer and Patti have \nbeen and continue to be irreparably harmed.  The children's special needs are not being met, \ncausing them delay in their development and other physical and emotional harm.  The children \n\ndo not know whether they will ever be reunified with their father, or, if not, if they will ever have \na permanent, stable family.  As a result they live in a state of constant anxiety and fear, and are \nbeing deprived of the opportunity for healthy development and a normal childhood, subjecting \nthem to further emotional harm. \n83.  Defendants have violated Jason, Jennifer and Patti's constitutional and statutory \nrights by failing to protect them from harm; by failing to provide their father with services \nnecessary to address their needs and facilitate their return to a parent; by failing to make \nreasonable efforts to prevent placement and then to make reasonable efforts after placement for \nthe children to safely be discharged from foster care to a parent; by failing to conduct an \nadequate search for relatives willing and able to care for them after they had to be removed from \ntheir mother and within thirty days of the children's entering custody and failing to make its best \neffort to place the children with a relative; by failing to ensure they achieve permanency by the \nearliest possible date; by failing to develop and implement a plan that would provide the children \nwith a permanency plan to either be returned to their parent or be adopted within a reasonable \nperiod of time; by failing to provide appropriate services and supervision while the children are in \nDYFS custody; by failing to support the family relationship by not providing parent,child visits as \nfrequently as required, all of which are required by law and by reasonable professional standards. \nC.  DENNIS M. and DENISE R. \n84.  Plaintiffs Dennis M. and Denise R. are siblings who are eight and seven years old, \nrespectively.  They have been under DYFS supervision since at least 1995, and in DYFS custody \nsince at least 1997.  Their mental health has deteriorated due to the Division's failure to provide \nfor their special needs.  Successive inappropriate DYFS placements have continued to jeopardize \nDennis and Denise's mental health. \n85.  DYFS did not remove Dennis and Denise from their grandparents' home, \nhowever, until 1997, when DYFS finally concluded that the children were unsafe, poorly \nsupervised and being neglected.  DYFS petitioned the Family Court for custody, and placed both \nchildren in foster care.  Later that year, DYFS placed Dennis and Denise with their father. \n,16, \n\n86.  Both Dennis and Denise have learning disabilities and severe emotional and \nbehavioral problems.  Both children have been attending special schools for the emotionally \ndisturbed.  Dennis started exhibiting fear of returning to his father's home after school.  On \nseveral occasions, his hands had to be pried from a school railing to get him on the school bus \nhome.  Professionals familiar with Dennis' case repeatedly expressed concern to DYFS regarding \nthe care Dennis was receiving in his father's home.  Dennis also disclosed that another adult in \nhis father's home was placing Dennis at serious risk of physical injury.  The Division's \ninvestigation into Dennis' allegations, however, was inadequate, and that report of suspected \nabuse and neglect was unsubstantiated by DYFS. \n87.  Dennis and Denise were left in their father's home for over one year by DYFS, \nuntil their father was arrested in November 1998 for sexually assaulting a minor.  He was later \nconvicted of the crime.  Dennis has since also reported that his father made him vandalize \nautomobiles by breaking their windows. \n88.  After a one~week stay in an inappropriate placement, in November 1998, Dennis \nwas placed with his sister Denise in the emergency foster home where they currently live.  Both \nchildren continue to have serious emotional and behavioral problems.  The current foster parent \nis unable to meet their needs.  While DYFS has recently acknowledged that the children should \nbe in a therapeutic foster home that could provide specialized care, DYFS has failed to secure \nsuch a home for them or to otherwise provide adequately for the children's special needs. \n89.  No adequate permanency planning has been initiated on behalf of these two \nyoung siblings.  Although DYFS has recently acknowledged that adoption should be their goal, \nupon information and belief none of the steps necessary to prepare and transfer their case to the \nARC, or to terminate parental rights, or to find them adoptive resources, have been completed. \n90.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Dennis and Denise have been \nand continue to be irreparably harmed.  They remain seriously emotionally disturbed due to the \nDivision's failure to protect them, keep them safe, place them in an appropriate home, and \nprovide them services for their special needs after their abuse was discovered.  The Division's \n\nrepeated inappropriate placements and failure to address the needs of these young children, \nwhich continue to this day, has caused them further deterioration and has exacerbated their \nemotional and behavioral problems.  Their lack of permanency causes them further anxiety and \nstress and they are being deprived of the opportunity for healthy development and a normal \nchildhood in a safe, loving, permanent family, subjecting them to further emotional harm. \n91.  Defendants have violated Dennis and Denise's constitutional and statutory rights \nby failing to protect them from harm; by failing to treat them in accordance with reasonable \nprofessional standards; by failing to provide them services necessary to prevent them from \ndeteriorating physically, psychologically or otherwise while in foster care; by failing to provide \nsafe, secure and appropriate placements; by failing to provide appropriate monitoring, supervision, \ncase planning and management; by failing to provide appropriate psychiatric and psychological \nand other appropriate services; by failing to conduct adequate investigations of abuse and neglect \nreports; by failing to conduct comprehensive assessments of the children; by failing to ensure \nfoster care placements that are appropriate to the individualized needs of the children; by failing \nto ensure that the children were being provided safe and appropriate care while being supervised \nby DYFS; by failing to ensure the homes in which the children were placed were appropriately \ninvestigated, reviewed and evaluated; by failing to ensure that the children achieved permanency \nat the earliest date by which it was safe to do so; by failing to ensure that they receive proper care \nwhile in state custody and that they or their foster parents receive the services necessary to \naddress the children's needs and to assure their placement into a permanent home; and by failing \nto ensure they receive all the benefits of the Division's child welfare program without \ndiscrimination for their handicaps or disabilities, all of which are required by law and by \nreasonable professional standards. \nD.  MARCO and IVAN C. \nc., \n92.  Plaintiffs Marco and his brother Juan  eight and ten years old, respectively, \nhave spent half their young lives in DYFS custody.  During that time they have been repeatedly \nshifted from one placement to another, sent out of state with the promise of adoption to a family \n-18-\n\nwhose home was so bad it was closed by local authorities, and returned to New Jersey only to be \nplaced by DYFS with foster parents who could not adequately communicate with them because \nthe boys only speak English and the foster parents speak almost exclusively Spanish.  The \nbrothers have now been separated, and Marco's condition is deteriorating in this inappropriate \nfoster home where his needs are not being met.  Even though these children will never be \nreturned to their parents, DYFS has not taken reasonable and timely actions to seek and secure a \npermanent home for them. \n93.  In the last four years that Marco and Juan have been in DYFS custody, each has \nbeen in ten different placements.  Both boys suffer from neurological and behavioral problems. \n94.  Marco and Juan lived together in a therapeutic foster home in New Jersey for two \nyears until January 1999, when DYFS sent them to live in a pre~adoptive home out~of~state. \n95.  DYFS sent these two young children out~of~state without conducting an adequate \ninvestigation of the potential adoptive family and home, and without taking necessary steps to \nensure that Marco and Juan would be safe or would receive appropriate care, and without \nadequate supervision, despite the fact that these children remained in the Division's legal \ncustody. \n96.  After Marco and Juan had lived in this new placement for only a few months, \nlocal authorities closed the home and sent the boys back to New Jersey, having discovered that \nthe family to whom defendants had entrusted Marco and Juan had adopted over 20 special needs \nchildren.  Many of the children in the home were filthy and heavily medicated, and were being \nabused. \n97.  When Marco and Juan were returned to New Jersey, DYFS placed them in a \nfoster home with parents that speak almost exclusively Spanish, despite the fact that the boys \nspeak only English.  These foster parents were unable to communicate adequately with the boys \nor with professionals involved with their care.  The foster parents also have had no training in \ncaring for children with the neurological and behavioral problems the boys are experiencing, nor \ndid DYFS provide them with the training to do so. \n~19~ \n\n98.  Juan is now placed in a foster home with an English~speaking foster mother who \nhas extensive experience in the care of special needs children.  Juan's behavior is improving and \nhe is thriving in this placement.  However, DYFS is failing to take necessary and timely action to \nensure a permanent placement for him. \n99.  Marco's behavior has deteriorated markedly since his return from the failed \npre~adoptive home out~of~state and separation from his brother.  Marco now exhibits severe signs \nof distress, such as excessive rocking, mutilating himself by scratching his neck until his skin is \nraw, and smearing his mucus over walls.  DYFS has failed to take reasonable steps to end the \ncontinuing harm to this eight~year~old child. \n100.  Although the goal that DYFS has set for Marco is adoption, the defendants have \nfailed to take reasonable and timely steps to accomplish that goal.  Instead, defendants have left \nMarco in a home that is an inappropriate permanent placement for him and have failed to take \nsteps to protect the only permanent relationship this child has had, with his brother Juan. \n101.  For most of the time that Marco and Juan have been in defendants' custody, the \nsupervision of their case and contacts with DYFS caseworkers have been inconsistent at best. \n102.  As a result of defendants' actions and inactions, Marco and Juan have been and \ncontinue to be irreparably harmed.  Both boys have serious psychological and neurological \nproblems which have been exacerbated by defendants' failures to fulfill their legal responsibilities \nto them.  As a result of defendants' actions and inactions, these young children have been \nsubjected to the serious emotional trauma of repeated movements while in foster care, further \nabuse and instability while in DYFS custody, and separation from each other, the only family \nmember with whom each has had an ongoing relationship.  In addition, defendants' failure to \ntake reasonable steps to seek an appropriate adoptive home for Marco while he has deteriorated \nin DYFS custody, and defendants' failure to provide permanency for Marco and Juan, are \ndepriving them of their only opportunity for a permanent family, and for healthy development \nand a normal childhood, subjecting them to further emotional harm. \n~20~ \n\n103.  Defendants have violated Marco and Juan's constitutional and statutory rights by \nfailing to protect them from harm while they have been the Division's responsibility; by failing to \nprovide them with proper care and treatment in accordance with reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing to provide appropriate foster care services once placed outside their home; by \nfailing to develop and implement appropriate permanent plans for them; by failing to conduct \nadequate assessments of the appropriateness and safety of their placements and obtain \nappropriate placements for them; by failing to appropriately screen and supervise their \nplacements; by failing to provide services necessary to prevent their deterioration while in DYFS \ncustody; by failing to ensure contact with their case workers in accordance with their case plans; \nby failing to ensure they receive medical, psychological and psychiatric services; by failing to \ndevelop and implement appropriate case plans; by separating these brothers unnecessarily and \nfailing to ensure contact and visitation between them when they were placed separately; by failing \nto provide planning and services that would permit them to be placed in a suitable permanent \nhome; and by failing to ensure they receive all the benefits of the Division's child welfare program \nwithout discrimination for their handicaps or disabilities, all of which are required by law and by \nreasonable professional standards. \nE.  RICARDO O. \n104.  Plaintiff Ricardo O. is a 13 1I2~year~old boy from Hudson County who has been in \nDYFS custody since June 1997, when he and his four siblings were removed from their mother's \nhome.  Ricardo had been sexually abused by his mother's boyfriend and, consequently, has serious \nmental health problems.  Since he became the Division's responsibility, DYFS has failed to place \nhim in a safe setting.  As a result, Ricardo was sexually abused again while he was in state \ncustody, and his mental health has deteriorated. \n105.  Before going into foster care, Ricardo lived with his divorced mother.  The four \noldest children, including Ricardo, have all since disclosed that they were sexually abused by their \nmother's boyfriend.  Ricardo was approximately ten years old when he was molested and \n\nthreatened by his abuser.  When Ricardo told his mother about the incident, she told him that \nshe did not believe him.  Ricardo was also beaten with a belt by his mother's boyfriend. \n106.  When Ricardo was removed from his mother's home and placed in DYFS custody, \nhe was already prescribed Prozac.  Defendants knew or should have known that Ricardo had \nserious psychological problems because of what he had experienced, and was in urgent need of \ntreatment and a specialized therapeutic placement.  However, DYFS failed to conduct an \nevaluation of his needs, or to secure an appropriate placement or necessary services for him. \n107.  Instead, all five children, and a later~born sixth sibling, were placed by DYFS with \nRicardo's maternal aunt in Camden.  DYFS made this placement without determining whether \nsuch a placement was appropriate for him and without providing necessary supervision or services \nto keep Ricardo from deteriorating while in DYFS custody. \n108.  While living in his aunt's home under DYFS supervision, Ricardo's behavior \nbecame increasingly disturbed, making clear his need for immediate treatment and help.  He \nattempted to drink Clorox, stuck his fingers in electrical sockets, tried to throw himself in front of \na moving car, and ran away from his aunt's home, hitchhiking on the New Jersey Turnpike.  He \nsaid that he heard voices telling him to do things and also saw monsters. \n109.  While living with his aunt in DYFS custody, Ricardo had to be hospitalized on \nthree separate occasions, each time for dangerous behaviors.  DYFS was aware of these \nhospitalizations and of Ricardo's worsening condition but took no steps to help him or to provide \nservices or a therapeutic placement.  After each hospitalization, he returned to his aunt's home. \n110.  Ricardo was so troubled that his aunt hid knives in the house so that Ricardo \ncould not get them. \n111.  In approximately September 1998, in the middle of the night, Ricardo cut his \npenis with a dull knife.  He also disclosed to his aunt that he had recently been sexually molested \nby an adult male.  He was again hospitalized. \n\n112.  Ricardo ultimately required psychiatric commitment, and in September, 1998 was \nplaced in the Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center (\"Brisbane\"), New Jersey's only children's \npsychiatric hospital. \n113.  DYFS referred Ricardo to nine residential facilities, each of which rejected him, \nbecause DYFS allows the facilities with which it contracts to do so without challenge. \n114.  While waiting for DYFS to find a less restrictive placement, Ricardo was housed \nwith older boys and was sexually assaulted by three older youths at Brisbane in March, 1999.  He \nwas subsequently forced to sleep in a seclusion unit for several weeks before being transferred to \nBrisbane's Coed unit for younger residents. \n115.  A tenth facility finally accepted Ricardo in early April 1999.  He was placed there \nin June 1999.  He reports that he does not feel safe there, and that he was just sexually assaulted \nand threatened by his roommate on August 2, 1999. \n116.  Ricardo currently suffers from Post~Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\"), \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\"), Impulse Control Disorder, depression, and \npsychosis, and has a learning disability.  He has been on several medications including Prozac, \nDepakote and Melaril. \n117.  DYFS has never developed an adequate permanent plan for Ricardo.  When \ndiscussing his life and his future, this 13 Yz ~year~old boy states: \"I've got nothing to live for.\" \n118.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Ricardo has been and \ncontinues to be irreparably harmed.  He has suffered continued physical and sexual abuse while \nin DYFS custody.  He does not know whether he will ever have a permanent family or any hope \nof a secure childhood. \n119.  Defendants have violated Ricardo's constitutional and statutory rights by failing to \nprotect him from harm; by failing to provide services to prevent him from deteriorating while in \nDYFS custody; by failing to provide appropriate placement and services to meet his needs; by \nfailing to meet his medical needs; by failing to place him promptly in the least restrictive \nplacement appropriate for his needs; by failing to provide appropriate supervision; by failing to \n\ndevelop and implement appropriate permanent plans; by failing to ensure his placement in a \npermanent home; and by failing to ensure he receives all the benefits of the Division's child \nwelfare program without discrimination for his handicap or disability, all of which are required by \nlaw and reasonable professional standards. \nF.  DOLORES and ANNA G. \n120.  Plaintiffs Dolores and Anna O. are sisters who are four years old and 17 months \nold, respectively. \n121.  Dolores and Anna have now spent a year in foster care.  Even though parental \nrights were terminated as to three previous children, and despite a history of neglect of Dolores \nand Anna and the fact that the home and parenting circumstances had not changed, the \nDivision's plan is to send Dolores and Anna back home.  However, DYFS has made no plans as \nto when it would be appropriate to do so or what services would be necessary to ensure that the \nchildren could be returned home safely. \n122.  Almost one year after they came into DYFS custody, DYFS is still planning for \nDolores and Anna to be reunified with their parents, even though DYFS previously terminated \nthese same parents' rights for three other children.  DYFS has made no reasonable determination \nthat the parents will ever be able to care for Dolores and Anna.  Dolores and Anna's parents \nrepeatedly miss their scheduled visits with the children. \n123.  Although DYFS knows or should know that it is highly unlikely that Anna and \nDolores can safely be returned to their parents' custody, DYFS has taken no action to place the \nchildren into a foster home that can also be a potential adoptive placement.  Instead, the \nchildren have been living for the last eleven months with a foster family with which they have \nformed emotional attachments, despite the fact that DYFS is aware that this family cannot \nprovide a permanent home for the girls. \n124.  In the spring of 1999, Dolores and Anna were assigned a new caseworker, who \nhas visited the foster home on only one occasion.  Meanwhile, Dolores and Anna's family court \nhearings have had to be adjourned due to the Division's lack of preparation. \n\n125.  Although both these children have significant physical and emotional needs \nbecause of their early deprivations, DYFS is failing to provide appropriate treatment, services and \nsupervision necessary to address those needs. \n126.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Dolores and Anna have been \nand continue to be irreparably harmed.  Dolores and Anna both have significant developmental \ndelays due to their previous home environment.  Dolores, at the age of four, functions like a \ntwo~and~one~half to three~year~old child and attends a pre~school class for the disabled. \n17 ~month~old Anna is just learning to walk.  Dolores and Anna do not know whether they will \nbe reunified with their biological parents or placed with an adoptive family, or when that decision \nwill be made.  They are likely to be removed from the foster family to whom they have formed \nattachments and moved to yet another family home, subjecting them to further emotional harm. \nDespite the fact that they ~~ as with their siblings before them ~~ have long been the Division's \nresponsibility, these young children are being deprived of the opportunity for healthy \ndevelopment and a normal childhood in a safe, loving permanent family, subjecting them to \nfurther emotional harm. \n12 7.  Defendants have violated Dolores and Anna's constitutional and statutory rights \nby failing to protect them from harm; by failing to make timely and meaningful casework contacts \nand monitor their progress; by failing to provide necessary services and an appropriate long~term \nplacement to these children once they entered foster care; by failing to provide appropriate \nmonitoring and supervision while in state custody; by failing to develop and implement a \npermanent plan that would allow them to leave foster care and secure a permanent home; by \nfailing to provide planning services to facilitate adoption or another permanent home; by failing \nto file timely petitions to terminate parental rights; and by failing to develop and implement \nappropriate permanency plans, all of which are required by law and by reasonable professional \nstandards. \n~25~ \n\nG.  KYLE I. \n128.  Kyle]. is a one~and~a~half~year~old infant from Essex County who remained in \nthe hospital for over two months after birth, but who was discharged to DYFS foster care after \nbeing deemed healthy by his doctors.  Kyle's mother is a homeless substance abuser who has \nnever visited her son or shown any interest in his welfare since his birth.  Her current \nwhereabouts are unknown.  Kyle's six~year~old brother is also currently in foster care.  DYFS has \nyet to place Kyle in a pre~adoptive home. \n129.  Although Kyle's doctors deemed him to be healthy, DYFS placed him in a foster \nhome for medically fragile infants.  DYFS was made aware that Kyle's foster parents are only \ninterested in providing temporary care for infants, and cannot adopt Kyle.  Despite this, DYFS \nlisted them in Kyle's record as a pre~adoptive resource.  One year and three months later, Kyle \nremains in this \"temporary,\" non~adoptive home. \n130.  Although DYFS has concluded that adoption is the appropriate goal for Kyle, it \nhas done nothing to further that plan.  While Kyle has been in DYFS custody since birth and his \nmother has never visited him, DYFS has not yet begun a proceeding to terminate his mother's \nparental rights. \n131.  DYFS has failed to place Kyle, who has been described as a beautiful, healthy, \nbright, curious boy, in an appropriate pre~adoptive placement.  As a result, Kyle has become \nemotionally attached to his foster parents, although DYFS knows that they cannot adopt him. \n132.  During the fifteen months that Kyle has been in his foster parents' care, his \ncaseworker has visited the home only three times. \n133.  At one point, DYFS was alerted to a potential adoptive home for Kyle.  DYFS \nnever called this family, which adopted another infant through a private agency. \n134.  As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, Kyle is being irreparably \nharmed.  He is growing up in foster care without a permanent family and is becoming emotionally \nattached to a family with whom he cannot live permanently.  Kyle is being deprived of an \n\nopportunity for healthy development and a normal childhood, subjecting him to further \nemotional harm. \n135.  Defendants have violated Kyle's constitutional and statutory rights by failing to \nprotect him from harm while in state custody; by failing to provide required caseworker contacts; \nby failing to provide appropriate monitoring, supervision and,case management; by failing to \ndevelop and implement an appropriate permanent plan; by failing to achieve permanency by \nfiling to terminate parental rights and arranging for his adoption within appropriate time frames; \nand by failing to implement his permanent plan and allow him to leave foster care and enjoy a \npermanent and secure home, all of which are required by law and by reasonable professional \nstandards. \nJ.  BARRYM. \n136.  Plaintiff Barry M. is a 17,year,old teenager from Camden County who has been \nin DYFS custody repeatedly since he was approximately four years old.  Barry was removed from \nhis mother's custody because of neglect as well as sexual abuse by her boyfriend.  His mother is a \nformer DYFS foster child.  Although Barry has been the Division's responsibility for most of the \nlast thirteen years, defendants have never provided Barry with appropriate services to address his \nproblems or to cope with the many losses that have been inflicted on this youngster throughout \nhis childhood.  Barry's latest DYFS placement is in a residential treatment facility in Georgia, far \nfrom his only remaining family, because DYFS has not developed sufficient facilities in New \nJersey for youngsters with mental illness and behavioral problems. \n13 7.  Barry's father died when Barry was an infant, and his step-father died when Barry \nwas eight years old.  Barry's mother died in December 1994.  Shortly after her death, Barry lost \ncontact with his only sibling, Natalie, who is 14 years old, when her adoptive family moved \nout,of-state. \n138.  When Barry was first removed from his mother's custody-at the approximate age \nof four, DYFS initially placed Barry with a foster family.  He was later placed with an aunt and \nthen with his maternal grandfather.  At that time, DYFS failed to assess Barry's mental health \n\nneeds related to his history of neglect and sexual abuse, or to provide appropriate and necessary \nservices to address those needs.  Barry remained with his grandfather for several years, until 1991, \nwhen Barry's grandfather suffered a stroke.  DYFS then placed Barry with a foster family, once \nagain without doing an adequate assessment of Barry's needs or providing services that were \nappropriate to address those needs. \n139.  In reaction to the losses in his family and the instability in his life, Barry began to \nexhibit the signs of serious emotional and behavioral problems.  Barry has now been diagnosed \nwith paranoid,schizophrenia with psychosis and conduct disorder.  He is currently prescribed \nHaldol, Cogentin and Zyprexa. \n140.  At the end of 1993, when Barry was eleven years old, he was arrested for burglary \nand placed by DYFS in a residential program.  In December 1994, while he was placed there, \nBarry's mother died, and shortly thereafter, Barry ran from the program and was subsequently \narrested again. \n141.  Since then, Barry has repeatedly alternated between detention, unsuccessful \nDYFS placements, and incarceration.  In 1995, DYFS placed Barry in another residential \nprogram from which he ran, then in a temporary therapeutic foster care home for a month, and \nthen sent him to live with a relative out,of,state.  That placement lasted approximately one \nmonth before Barry was sent back to New Jersey. \n142.  After several incarcerations, the Family Court ordered DYFS to identify an \nappropriate residential program for Barry. \n143.  In September 1998, Barry's grandfather signed a voluntary Residential Placement \nAgreement with DYFS and Barry was placed by DYFS at a residential treatment program \nout-of,state, far from his grandfather, because there is no adequate program in New Jersey.  Barry \nwas dismissed from that program after an altercation with a teacher in February 1999. \n144.  Barry was then held at a lock, up county detention center in Blackwood, New \nJersey, awaiting another DYFS placement. \n\n145.  The Family Court ordered Barry into DYFS custody for residential placement, \nbut DYFS did not have any appropriate program for Barry in New Jersey that would accept him. \nMeanwhile, Barry was held in the secure detention facility for three and a half months, without \nadequate psychiatric and other treatment services.  At least four scheduled dates for his move out \nof detention lapsed before Barry was moved out~ofstate again to a treatment program in Georgia \non July 7, 1999. \n146.  Contact with his grandfather, the only family he has left, is now limited.  The \nprogram he is now in will not keep him past his eighteenth birthday in June of next year. \n147.  Because of the defendants' actions and inactions, Barry has been and continues \nto be irreparably harmed.  Barry has been placed out~of~state again, far from his only remaining \nfamily, and he will need to be moved again in less than one year due to his age.  DYFS has not \nmade any plans for Barry's transition back to New Jersey and into adulthood.  The uncertainty of \nhis situation and his placement in an out~of~state facility is detrimental to his mental health and \nproper development. \n148.  The defendants have violated Barry's constitutional and statutory rights by failing \nto protect him from harm; by failing to provide an appropriate placement that can manage Barry's \npsychiatric and behavioral problems; by failing to provide him with a written plan, reviewed \nannually, to prepare him for self~sufficient living; by failing to ensure that the services he received \nwere designed to maintain and advance his mental and physical well~being; and by leaving him \nfor months without adequate psychiatric and other care in a secure detention facility which was \nnot the least restrictive placement to which Barry was entitled and which was inappropriate for \nhis individual needs; failing to provide Barry, who has a disability, with the least restrictive \nplacement and services appropriate to his particular needs; and by failing to ensure Barry receives \nall the benefits of the Division's child welfare program without discrimination for his handicap or \ndisability, all of which are required by law and by reasonable professional standards. \n\nK.  SHARONK. \n149.  Plaintiff Sharon K.,  who is  four  years old,  was born in Middlesex County and \nwithin days  of her birth entered DYFS  custody directly from  the  hospital.  Her mother was \nabusing drugs and alcohol, and her father's identity was unknown. She has remained in DYFS \nplacement since birth. Her current permanency planning goal is adoption. \n150.  Sharon K.,  who is African~American, was placed with Caucasian foster parents, \nMr. and Mrs. K. at six days old, and remains with them to this date. Sharon K. has never known \nany other home and considers Mr. and Mrs. K. to be her mother and father. Even though she is \nbonded to Mr. and Mrs. K and will suffer grave harm if she is separated from them, Defendants \nare delaying or denying her adoption in this home because her foster parents are of a different \nrace and color than Sharon K. \n151.  Within a year of Sharon K.'s placement in DYFS custody, her case was transferred \nto the DYFS Metro Adoption Resource Center (\"ARC\") in Edison, New Jersey. In early 1998, her \nfoster parents expressed to DYFS their interest in adopting Sharon K. and signed a letter of intent \naffirming that they would adopt Sharon K. when she was free for adoption. \n152.  Sharon K.'s foster parents had already successfully adopted six DYFS children with \nspecial needs during the previous ten years. Mr. and Mrs. K. have received recognition awards for \ndedication and outstanding service as foster and adoptive parents from DYFS's Middlesex District \nOffice, DYFS's Metro ARC office, and the DYFS Central Office. The six children they adopted \nare all Caucasian. \n153.  Sharon K. was legally freed for adoption on June 24, 1998. \n154.  A DYFS homestudy approving Sharon K. 's foster parents to adopt Sharon K. was \nnot completed until May 1999. \n155.  By June 1999, the petition to finalize Sharon K.'s adoption by her foster parents, \nMr. and Mrs. K. was finally ready for submission to the court. DYFS, however, never proceeded \nwith the adoption petition and, beginning in June 1999, repeatedly informed Sharon K.'s foster \n~30~ \n\nparents that the adoption was \"on hold,\" even though a DYFS manager admitted that there is no \nsuch status. \n156.  In fact, Sharon K.'s ARC worker was instructed to stop the adoption by the DYFS \nworker who had completed the homestudy because DYFS had some unspecified concerns about \nthe placement. This same worker inquired of the ARC worker whether Sharon K.'s skin was \n\"ashy\" and whether Sharon K.'s hair was properly groomed \"  questions clearly related to her race \nand color. \n157.  When Mr. and Mrs.  K.  had previously taken in a biracial foster child, a DYFS \nsocial worker told  them on or about March 1995  to \"be careful, because they [DYFS]  don't \nalways let you adopt a black baby.\" Shortly thereafter, that child was removed from this foster \nhome and placed with a relative. \n158.  Defendants have delayed and denied Sharon K.'s adoption by her foster parents \nbecause of Sharon K.'s race. This is part of a policy, pattern and practice of racial discrimination \nand racial matching in foster and adoptive placements by DYFS  and of delaying and denying \nadoptions because of the race of the child and/or the adoptive parents. These policies, patterns of \nconduct and practices are not consistent with reasonable and accepted professional standards and \ndo not constitute professional decision' making with respect  to selecting appropriate adoptive \nparents for  children in DYFS  custody for  whom adoption is  determined to be appropriate or \nexpediting  the  adoption  of such  children.  Defendants  have  been  aware  of and  deliberately \nindifferent to these policies, patterns and practices that delay and deny adoption on the grounds \nof race and color. \n159.  As  a result of the Defendants'  actions  and inactions, Sharon K.  has been and \ncontinues to be irreparably harmed and deprived of the security of a permanent, loving home, \n\" \nbecause of her race  and color.  She also  risks  serious psychological and emotional harm from \nfurther denial of that security. \n160.  Defendants  have  violated  Sharon K.'s  statutory rights  pursuant  to  MEPA,  by \ndelaying or denying her placement for adoption on the basis of her race and color. Defendants \n,31, \n\nhave also violated her substantive due process right to be free from harm while in Defendants' \ncustody by subjecting her to the uncertainties of a temporary foster care placement and the risk of \nan  arbitrary  removal  from  the  only  family  she  has  known,  as  well  as  the  emotional  and \npsychological damage she will suffer as she ages and becomes aware that her adoption has been \ndelayed and denied because of her race and color. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \n161.  The experiences and current circumstances of the named plaintiffs are typical of \nthe class.  They illustrate defendants' long~standing pattern and practice of not meeting the needs \nof the children in the plaintiff class and reflect deliberate indifference to and failure to exercise \nprofessional judgment regarding the health, safety and welfare of the plaintiff class.  Because of \nthe failures in decision~making at every level, as well as the lack of placements and services, the \nlack of planning for children, and the absence of accountability, plaintiff children are not \nreceiving adequate protection, care, treatment and services as required by law.  This system's \nchronic dysfunction is hurting the very children defendants are obligated to protect. \n162.  The Governor's own Blue Ribbon Panel concluded in 1998 that \"New Jersey's \nchild welfare system has been seriously damaged by years of neglect[,]\" and has reached \"a state of \ncrisis,\" as previously described in numerous other reports such as the Association for Children of \nNew Jersey's (\"ACNJ\") 1997 \"Children First\" report, 1996 \"In Their Own Words\" report, 1994 \n\"Stolen Futures\" report and 1988 \"Splintered Lives\" report.  Despite their long~standing \nawareness of the need to redress systemic problems in the child welfare system, however, \ndefendants have refused to exercise their authority to ensure that adequate funds are available \nand used appropriately to ensure compliance with their legal responsibilities to plaintiff children. \n163.  Little has changed since the Blue Ribbon Panel Report was issued more than 17 \nmonths ago.  Over one year ago, on June 30, 1998, DYFS issued a Strategic Plan in response to \nthe Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendations, but it ignored the Blue Ribbon Panel's \"unequivocal \nconclusion that continued sustained investment of resources will be required to achieve the \n\nessential changes in the child welfare system.\" The Strategic Plan contained only non~specific \ngoals and lacked any discussion of the key problem areas identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel, \nincluding the lack of resources, unmanageable caseloads and inadequate staffing that are a result \nof a decade of defendants' willful neglect of the Division and repeated cuts to its budget.  The \nDivision's resources and staff have been decimated, but there has been little, if any, reform made \nin these areas, as acknowledged in the Division's 1999 Report Card, issued on July 23, 1999.  The \nensuing violations of plaintiffs' rights, detailed below, continue. \nOut~of~ Home Placements \n164.  When children are removed from their families, DYFS is failing to ensure that \nthey are placed in safe settings that can meet their needs.  Case workers first have to transport \nchildren in old, unsafe automobiles without appropriate child car seats.  Regional Foster Care \nUnits are in disarray and children are shuffled in and out of inappropriate placements.  Many are \ndiverted to informal placements and their cases closed without any DYFS services or judicial \noversight. \nLack of Appropriate DYFS Foster Homes \n165.  When children are taken into DYFS custody, they are being placed wherever \nthere is an available bed regardless of their particular needs, because defendants have not \ndeveloped a sufficient quantity of proper placements to meet the needs of children in DYFS care \nand custody.  In addition, insufficient safeguards exist to assure that children are not actually \nsuffering harm in foster care.  As a result, many children who have already suffered the effects of \nabuse or neglect in their own homes are further deteriorating in the Division's custody. \n166.  DYFS has failed to recruit sufficient numbers of foster homes to meet the needs \nof the steadily increasing number of children coming into DYFS care.  As reported by the Home \nNews Tribune, in an Associated Press article, on November 30, 1998, New Jersey state officials \nestimate that they need 500 more foster homes to provide a safe place for every abused and \nneglected child who needs a home.  According to the Division's own 1999 Report Card, since \nJuly 1998, it has only been able to increase its net pool of foster homes by 93.  The number of \n\navailable foster homes has since declined, however, and the Division expects to lose more homes \nas it finally implements a program to certify foster homes. \n167.  Newly regionalized Home Finding Units, responsible for matching children with \navailable foster homes, are understaffed and overwhelmed, so that when a child is removed from \nhome, district office caseworkers are often left to find available foster homes themselves.  The \ndisarray in the Home Finding Units is so extreme that one unit even arranged for a young child \nto be placed in a foster home in Ocean County even though the home was closed to younger \nchildren because an older child in the home had sexually abused a young child in that very home. \n168.  There are so few placement resources that in some DYFS district offices it is a \ndaily occurrence for several children to be awaiting placement at the office all day and well into \nthe night, sometimes staying until midnight.  Repeated overnight emergency placements are \noften resorted to, and many children experience daily changes in placement.  One child was \nbrought in daily to the Perth Amboy district office for two consecutive weeks waiting for a \nplacement and was exposed there to a janitor masturbating as a result. \n169.  Due to the lack of available placement resources, workers also frequently place \nchildren in foster homes beyond their allowable capacity ~~ the maximum number of children a \nparticular home is allowed to care for at any given time.  Waivers of DYFS placement policies are \nroutinely being granted for emergency overnight placements even though placing more children \nin a home than the foster family can manage places all the children in the home at greater risk of \nharm. \n170.  Many foster homes are not safe.  Foster homes have been subject only to a \nperfunctory approval process with insufficient standards to ensure that children will be safe. \nDYFS then fails to monitor foster homes providing care to children in DYFS custody and fails to \nmake the required annual assessments of these homes.  Upon information and belief, only 275 of \nthe 2,686 foster homes state~wide have been certified by DYFS as part of the Division's new \ncertification protocol.  At the current rate it will be more than a year before existing foster homes \nhave all been inspected for certification. \n\n171.  Some foster homes are filthy, offer poor child supervision and have consistently \nviolated DYFS policies and regulations.  Workers do not have time to check up on children \nwithin the first week of placement as required. \n172.  Caseworker complaints of abuse or neglect by foster parents are often not \nreported by DYFS, because the Division tolerates behavior from foster parents which would be \nunacceptable if exhibited by birth parents.  Despite notice of foster child abuse, the Division \nroutinely delays any action, thus jeopardizing children's safety in foster care.  Some foster homes \nthat repeatedly have had children removed because of social worker complaints of abuse are still \nreceiving DYFS children. \n173.  When formally filed, reports of children being abused or neglected while in a \nfoster home are referred to the Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (\"IAIU\") for investigation. \nInstead of being fully investigated or assessed as independent protective investigation cases as \nrequired, however, many of these investigations are simply referred on by the IAIU to the \nongoing caseworker.  District offices are instructed to handle these reports of child abuse or \nneglect as contract performance problems with the foster parents instead of child protection \ncases.  Foster homes are so scarce that some children remain placed in foster homes where the \nInstitutional Abuse Unit has substantiated reports of physical abuse by the foster parents. \n174.  Children who suffer multiple movements, effectively severing over and over \nagain attachments they have formed, become increasingly unable to love and trust their \ncaretakers, exhibit higher levels of problem behavior, and are more difficult to place in permanent \nhomes as a consequence.  Such movement also disrupts children's education as they move from \nschool to school. \n175.  54% of New Jersey children in regular foster care have had multiple placements. \nChildren who experience multiple placements typically spend more time in care before returning \nhome or achieving an alternate permanent plan than children who experience one placement.  In \nNew Jersey, the average time in regular foster care for children with multiple placements is 41.14 \n\nmonths, or over 3.3 years, compared to 32.4 7 months, or approximately 2.7 years for all children \nin regular foster care. \nInadequate and Harmful Adolescent Placements \n176.  Because of the lack of foster or group home placements available for teenagers, \nmany youth are placed in emergency shelter care facilities for extended periods of time.  The \naverage stay in some short term shelters that are only intended to house youth for 14 days is \napproximately six months.  As a result, these youth are denied necessary therapeutic treatment \nby qualified professionals because the shelters are not designed to provide such treatment \nservices. \n177.  Some teenage girls who give birth while in foster care are separated from their \ninfant children solely because of a lack of appropriate mother~child placements.  Teenage \nmothers and their babies are thus unnecessarily deprived of their opportunity to develop and \nnurture an emotional attachment while in separate DYFS placements. \n178.  Other youth, who have been adjudicated delinquent and ordered by the Family \nCourt into DYFS care and custody for placement, wait for months in county detention centers \nbefore being placed by DYFS, although detention is intended to be temporary only.  Meanwhile, \nspecialized treatment is not provided nor are county detention center staff trained to meet the \nneeds of those youth who need specialized care.  For example, while many DYFS youth in \ndetention centers need special education and psychiatric help, the county detention centers are \nnot equipped to address special education or therapeutic needs. \n179.  In addition, some youth waiting for DYFS placement are in severely overcrowded \ndetention centers such as those in Atlantic, Camden, and Hudson counties.  Some youth in \ncounty detention centers awaiting DYFS placement do not even have basic toiletries such as \nsoap, or clean underclothes. \nInadequate and Harmful Special Needs Placements \n180.  Many children with special medical or psychiatric needs are inappropriately \nplaced, which results in additional, harmful deterioration of their condition.  The reduction in \n\navailable residential treatment facility placements in particular has resulted in children being \nreferred later in a much more traumatized and fragile state, often after years of inappropriate \nmovement through the foster care system. \nServices to Foster Children \n181.  Defendants fail to provide foster children with the services necessary to keep \nthem free from harm while in foster care and to prevent their stay in foster care from being longer \nthan necessary. \n182.  DYFS caseloads are too high to allow for professional foster care services for \nevery child entitled to such critical services.  In Essex County, for example, caseworkers carry \ncaseloads of 70 to 90 children each, far above reasonable professional standards. \n183.  Because of high caseloads, case workers do not have time to visit children in \ntheir foster homes or procure services necessary to support the children's behavioral and \nemotional needs.  In addition, many services needed by children are simply not available, further \ncompromising case workers' ability to function effectively. \n184.  While in DYFS custody, children suffer a myriad of substantial deprivations, such \nas inadequate physical and mental health care and inadequate educational services. \nHealth Care and Related Services \n185.  Although DYFS is required to ensure that children in its custody receive \nadequate health care, the Division does not adequately track children's health care needs and \nrecords.  As a result, many foster children's physical and mental health care needs go \nunaddressed. \n186.  Besides an initial medical screening before placement, which usually only consists \nof a visit to a hospital emergency room, foster children do not routinely receive medical care. \nMany foster children are behind on their immunizations.  The failure to provide health services \nto foster children is particularly egregious in that foster children tend to have heightened health \ncare needs as a.  result of their background of abuse and/or neglect. \n\n187.  DYFS routinely expects foster parents to assess and coordinate their foster \nchildren's health care needs, as caseworkers do not have the time to do so themselves.  While \nchildren in DYFS custody are eligible for Medicaid, DYFS often fails to make children's Medicaid \ncards available to foster parents.  Thus, when a foster child needs medical care, the foster parent \nis often required to pay the costs out of pocket.  DYFS then fails to reimburse the foster parents \nfor these out~of~pocket medical expenses. \n188.  Children in DYFS care with parents known to be HIV positive are not routinely \ntested for the HIV virus themselves, jeopardizing their effective treatment if they are in fact \ninfected. \n189.  DYFS does not provide children with needed counseling or therapy after \ntraumatic removals from their parents' homes.  DYFS does not explain to the children what is \nhappening to them. \n190.  For those children with mental health care needs, there is a critical lack of \nappropriate services.  The Division's failure to develop and provide an adequate range and \nquantity of mental health care services ~~ from out~patient counseling to in~patient psychiatric \ncare ~~ deprives children of necessary health care.  According to figures analyzed by ACN], \npsychological and therapeutic services, including evaluations and on~going treatment, were cut \n21.6% in the FY 98 budget. \n191.  The Blue Ribbon Panel Report recommended that DYFS \"[m]ove to eliminate \nthe considerable variability in determining the need for and extent of diagnostic and treatment \nservices within District offices by developing minimal standards and assuring adherence to such \nthrough a monitoring process.\"  However, the Division's Strategic Plan does not address these \nrecommendations and, upon information and belief, the recommendations have not been \nimplemented. \n192.  Defendants have failed to develop a functioning children's mental health system. \nDYFS is routinely unable to access the services provided by the Division of Mental Health \nServices (\"DMHS\") and the Division of Developmental Disabilities (\"DDD\") for the children in \n\nDYFS custody because of a long,standing lack of coordination and access among these various \ndivisions of the Department of Human Services. \n193.  There are approximately 1500 to 2000 children on waiting lists for placements \nwith Division of Developmental Disabilities programs.  Many times DYFS social workers cannot \neven get personnel at DDD to answer their phone calls. \n194.  As a result, many foster children do not receive the mental health care they \nneed, which often results in disrupted placements and the movement of these children from one \nfoster care placement to another, causing further problems.  Ultimately, these children often end \nup hospitalized or involved with the juvenile justice system because their mental health problems \nhave gone unaddressed for too long. \nEducational Services \n195.  DYFS systemically fails to ensure that all children in foster care receive an \neducation appropriate to their needs and in accordance with state education laws.  This includes, \nbut is not limited to, ensuring that all foster children receive appropriate academic and vocational \nguidance. \n196.  Children being moved between placements are kept out of school for days at a \ntime.  Children are also often taken out of school for an entire day each time they attend \nvisitation with their parents and/or siblings, rather than having these visits scheduled during \nnon,school hours. \n197.  Children in need of special education who are in county detention centers or \ntemporary shelters awaiting DYFS placement for up to six months are not receiving appropriate \neducational services. \nAdoption Services \n198.  DYFS has also delayed or blocked the adoption of some African,American foster \nchildren by their non~African~American foster parents because of race, thus limiting adoption \nopportunities for many children.  Meanwhile, the children languish in foster care, awaiting \n~39~ \n\npermanent families despite the fact that in many instances, families already taking care of them \nare available to adopt them. \nCaseworker Screening, Training, Retention and Support \n199.  Even though DYFS staff are entrusted with protecting the well;being of the most \nvulnerable children in the State, DYFS suffers from insufficient and inadequately trained and \nsupervised staff, excessive caseworker workloads, and inadequate support staff and supplies.  This \nhas made worker professionalism almost impossible and contributed to low worker morale, worker \nburnout, and high attrition rates.  As a result, defendants are not providing a workforce that can \nprotect plaintiff children from harm, or provide them with necessary services, or ensure \ncompliance with applicable legal and professional standards. \n200.  Staffing levels have not kept pace with increased referrals to and demands on \nDYFS.  While the number of children and families needing DYFS services continues to increase, \nDYFS has eliminated hundreds of positions since fiscal year 1991, with most cuts coming from \ndirect service staff positions.  Staff additions in the last two years have not made up the chronic \nshortfall, so that even non;case carrying staff are being assigned to cover cases. \n201.  In addition, DYFS has never achieved full staffing of existing positions.  The \nburden on remaining staff is even greater because DYFS vacancy rates do not include its \nnumerous personnel on leave, many for stress;related health problems.  Also, inappropriate or \nincompetent staff are retained because otherwise additional positions would be left unfilled. \n202.  Additional vacancies in the district offices are being created by the improvident \ntransfer of case workers to the regional offices and ARCS. \n203.  Meanwhile, the hiring of several hundred additional caseworker trainees over the \npast two years has had little impact on the provision of direct services as most new workers are \nunqualified, inexperienced, poorly trained, and many have already resigned. \n204.  New caseworkers being hired by DYFS are only required to have a bachelor's \ndegree in any subject without any related work experience.  In addition, applicants are not \nadequately screened for their ability to succeed in such challenging and critical positions. \n\n205.  There is inadequate training for new workers, so that inexperienced new workers \nhave to rely heavily on whatever informal training they can get from more experienced \nco~workers. New workers are also being assigned complex and difficult cases that should be \nreserved for experienced staff. \n206.  CPS screeners and intake workers in particular are poorly supervised and lack \nthe guidance of any uniform or clearly applied policies or adequate training regarding screening \ncriteria and when removal of the child or provision of in~home services is appropriate. \n207.  There is inadequate in~service training for experienced workers.  Workers do not \nhave the time to avail themselves of training provided in any event because of high caseloads. \nTraining manuals are not readily available to staff. Computer training is minimal. \n208.  Because many promotions are now based on a worker's ability 'to close cases \ninstead of on quality of social work practice, an increasing number of DYFS supervisors do not \nhave the appropriate skills and experience to direct and be accountable for a workforce required \nto make critical life and death decisions.  In addition, such inappropriate promotions demoralize \nexperienced caseworkers and supervisors. \n209.  Because supervisors are responsible for too many workers and do not all have the \nnecessary skills, experience and education, caseworkers do not receive needed supervision, \nguidance or support.  Much of the supervision received is \"hallway\" supervision when a crisis \noccurs.  One case worker in the Central Passaic district office has only had one formal supervision \nmeeting in the past two years.  CPS supervisors are also either unqualified or untrained to \nperform the requirements of their positions, or are too overworked to perform their duties \nadequately.  Supervisor to caseworker ratios exceed the 1:5 ratio recommended by the Child \nWelfare League of America.  Some units have up to eight workers per one supervisor, and some \ndays there is only one supervisor in a DYFS district office responsible for up to eight separate \nunits of workers. \n210.  While the Child Welfare League of America (\"CWLA\") recommends that \nworkers be responsible for no more than 12 family cases in intake and 17 families in ongoing \n\nservices, for DYFS workers individual caseloads of over 80 children are not unusual.  With \naverage caseloads well over reasonable professional standards in all units, adequate casework is \nnot possible. \n211.  The Blue Ribbon Panel Report confirmed that case worker staffing levels are \nwoefully inadequate, staffing goals are unrealistically low and even then still unmet, and case \nworker hiring requirements must be increased in order to develop a qualified and motivated staff. \nThe Blue Ribbon Panel Report recommended that DYFS should conform its caseload standards \nto established national standards as recommended by the CWLA, to enable workers to effectively \nprovide services to children and their families. \n212.  The DHS Critical Incident and Child Death Review Board, created in 1992 to \nexamine cases in which a child under DYFS supervision (currently or within the past 12 months) \ndies or is critically injured due to abuse or neglect, released a report in 1998 covering deaths in \n1995~96, and a final report covering deaths in 1997.  The Board noted in these fatality reports \nthat inadequate staffing levels throughout DYFS contributed to work overload for many \ncaseworkers and all levels of supervision and had a negative impact on the staffs' ability to \neffectively manage daily tasks and protect children. \n213.  However, the Division's Strategic Plan does not address this issue and, upon \ninformation and belief, the Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendation has not been implemented. \n214.  The Division's response has been to put enormous pressure on supervisors and \ncase workers to keep caseloads down by closing cases.  Case workers are told to close cases if no \nservices are available for a family, even though the need for ongoing services is apparent and the \ncase will most likely come back as a new intake case.  So that caseloads will appear lower, siblings \nof abused and neglected children are also closed out from active cases if they are not imminently \nat risk, without consideration of their need for preventive services. \n215.  DYFS provides case workers with inadequate clerical support and supplies, also \naffecting their ability to perform their jobs competently.  Case workers are expected to do their \nown typing and data entry.  Copy machines routinely do not work.  Case workers have had to \n\nwait for an available car to be returned to the office before they could respond to emergencies.  In \norder to respond to simultaneous emergencies, workers compete over whatever car is available. \nNeeded supplies as simple as blank copies of voluntary placement agreements are often \nunavailable. \n216.  When a case worker has to work after hours on an emergency, management in \nsome DYFS district offices imposes mandatory flex time, requiring the case worker to report to \nwork late the next day, so as to avoid paying overtime, even though the workers' case loads need \nimmediate attention.  Case workers with too many cases have to complete much necessary case \nwork, such as parent/child visits, on their own time or not at all. \n217.  With high caseloads and a lack of adequate training, support and supervision, a \nlarge number of DYFS caseworkers are resigning.  As a result, the front~line staff is frequently \nyoung, inexperienced and poorly trained, putting an even higher burden on the remaining \nexperienced over~worked staff.  Many cases remain unassigned or uncovered for weeks and even \nmonths. \nAccountability Throughout the System \n218.  The current level of accountability in New Jersey's child welfare system is \ninadequate.  The diminished capacity of DYFS to carry out many basic management functions \nhas resulted in weak internal assessment and oversight functions.  External oversight of DYFS by \nDHS and Governor Whitman has also been inadequate. \n219.  DYFS has no accurate or timely system for the measurement of case \nmanagement and outcomes.  Management cannot track individual case progress and only has \nperiodic case totals to rely on. \n220.  DYFS has no operational or effective quality assurance program.  The Governor's \nBlue Ribbon Panel Report estimated that DYFS only reviewed 0.0035% of its cases for quality \nassurance purposes. \n221.  Nor does DYFS have a functioning system for monitoring the quality of foster \ncare and related services.  The Blue Ribbon Panel Report noted that\" [f] oster care has never \n\nofficially been reviewed .. , and thus, there is no baseline of what the status of practice and quality \nof care is in order to address the areas of needs or gaps.\" \n222.  DYFS has no functioning system for monitoring contracted services provided by \nprivate agencies that include most residential and group home placements as well as preventive \nservices. \n223.  Field staff are unfamiliar with the services available, various contracts, or \nchanges in policy and practice within DYFS.  Central office senior officials are remote and \nuninformed.  Management staff do not know what is actually happening to children and families \nin the field. \n224.  Prior to the Blue Ribbon Panel Report, the DHS Critical Incident and Child \nDeath Review Board had reviewed and reported on cases through 1994 to determine if the cases \nwere handled appropriately and what if any changes in practice were needed.  According to the \nGovernor's own Blue Ribbon Panel Report, however, the identified concerns and \nrecommendations regarding DYFS case practice in the two reports covering cases through 1994 \nhad still not been adequately addressed by DYFS. \nInsufficient Resource Development and Maximization \n225.  Assuming a modest 3% inflation rate from FY 1992 to FY 1998, the DYFS FY \n1998 budget fell $47 million short of providing the same level of services that was provided in FY \n1992.  Recent additions to the state appropriations for DYFS have not closed the gap, especially \nin light of the increase in cases over the past seven years. \n226.  DYFS fails to ensure that the New Jersey child welfare system receives the \nmaximum amount of possible federal financial support to which it is entitled and which could be \nused to enhance services for children and families.  For example, despite the obvious need for \ntraining, New Jersey has requested and received one of the smallest amounts of Title IV~E federal \nfunds earmarked for training in the country, with only four other states requesting less, according \nto the most recent comparative data available. \n\n227.  The Blue Ribbon Panel Report recommended that DYFS \"[c]onduct a complete \nbudget analysis of every aspect of the Division's operations.\" The Blue Ribbon Panel also \nrecommended that DYFS \"[a]llocate sufficient resources for appropriate staffing levels,\" for \n\"administrative support, equipment, cars and technology to carry out functions that have been \ncompromised by shortages in each of these areas,\" and for \"improved training.\" The Panel also \nrecommended that the Division \"devote more resources to preventive and family support, \npreservation, and reunification services.\" \n228.  However, the Division's Strategic Plan does not address these recommendations \nand, upon information and belief, the recommendations have not been implemented. \n229.  DYFS is currently running a deficit of approximately $40 million for money owed \nto residential treatment facilities for prior services rendered. \nLack of Planning and Failure to Prioritize Systemic Improvements \n230.  Although long, term strategic planning is necessary to resolve the problems \nconfronting the child welfare system in New Jersey, the defendants have only managed to \nrespond episodically to crises with ineffective short, term fixes. \n231.  The cumulative effects of a decade of neglect, budget cuts and minimal \nmaintenance of New Jersey's child welfare system now require a drastic restructuring and infusion \nof resources.  Additional emergency allocations to the Division's budget in recent years have only \nrestored a fraction of the budget losses the Division suffered throughout the last decade. \nMoreover, few of the resources that had been cut in the past ten years have been restored. \n232.  The Strategic Plan DYFS issued in response to the Blue Ribbon Panel's \nrecommendations contains only very non, specific goals and is inadequate to address the \nlong, term disintegration of the Division.  As set forth throughout this Complaint, many of the \nBlue Ribbon Panel's Recommendations went ignored in the Strategic Plan and, upon information \nand belief, the recommendations have not been implemented.  As acknowledged by the data in \nthe Division's 1999 Report Card, the Division's recent attempts at reform have resulted in little \nmeaningful change. \nA5, \n\n233.  DYFS does not operate in a manner consistent with reasonable professional \nstandards or applicable legal standards, and, as a direct result, plaintiffs are being denied their \nlegal rights and subjected to unnecessary harm by state officials legally responsible for their care \nand protection. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action ~ Substantive Due Process \n234.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the defendants are inconsistent with the \nexercise of reasonable professional judgment and also amount to a pattern, practice and custom \nof deliberate indifference to plaintiff children's constitutional rights.  As a result, plaintiff children \nare being deprived of their substantive due process rights conferred upon them by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  These rights include, but are not limited to, \ntheir right to protection from harm; their right not to be harmed\" physically, emotionally, \ndevelopmentally or otherwise -- while in state custody; their right to treatment; their right to \ntreatment related to the cause of their confinement; their right to receive care, treatment and \nservices consistent with competent professional judgment. \nSecond Cause of Action ~ The Multiethnic Placement Act \n235.  As a result of the foregoing actions and inactions of the defendants, the plaintiff \nchildren are being deprived of the rights conferred upon them by the federal Multiethnic \nPlacement Act of 1994, as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996.  These \nrights include, but are not limited to the right not to have adoptive or foster placements delayed \nor denied on the basis of the race, color or national origin of the foster or adoptive parent or of \nthe child. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff children respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \nA.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \nB.  Order that plaintiffs may maintain this action as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \n\nC.  Declare unconstitutional and unlawful pursuant to Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure defendants' failure to provide for plaintiffs' safety and freedom from harm, \nconsistent with the exercise of reasonable professional judgment and failure to comply with the \nfederal Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions \nof 1996; \nD.  Permanently enjoin defendants from subjecting members of the plaintiff class to \npractices that violate their rights; \nE.  Order appropriate remedial relief to ensure defendants' future compliance with \nlegally mandated services to plaintiffs; \nF.  Appoint an expert panel with full access to defendants, their records and their \npersonnel, to develop and oversee the implementation of a plan for reform, to ensure that defen~ \ndants protect the constitutional and federal statutory rights of the plaintiff class; \nG.  Award plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.c. \n§§ 1988 & 1920; and \nH.  Grant such other and further equitable relief as the Court deems just, necessary \nand proper to protect the plaintiff class members from further harm by defendants. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBy; \nDAVID L.

CORZINE \nJANUARY 1 – JUNE 30, 2007 \n \n \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n \nPurpose of this Report \nIn July, 2006 the Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) was appointed by the Honorable \nStanley R. Chesler of the United States District Court for the Third Circuit as Monitor of Charlie \nand Nadine H. v. Corzine. As Monitor, CSSP is to assess independently the State’s compliance \nwith the goals, principles and outcomes of the Modified Settlement Agreement (MSA) of the \nclass action litigation aimed at improving the State’s child welfare system.1 CSSP released its \nPeriod I Monitoring Report in February 2007 describing progress New Jersey had made towards \ncompliance with the MSA as of December 31, 2006.2 This is the second Monitoring report under \nthe MSA and covers the period of January through June 2007. \n \nThe MSA structures the State’s commitments into two phases of work. Phase I (through \nDecember 2008) is primarily directed to building a strong infrastructure within the Department \nof Children and Families (DCF) to ensure that children are healthy and safe, achieve permanency \nand stability, and that resource and service delivery systems meet children’s health, mental \nhealth, educational and developmental needs. This second Monitoring report reflects the State’s \ncontinued work in and commitment to these foundational elements of a successful reform, and \nalso describes the State’s efforts towards implementing its new Case Practice Model (CPM), \nwhich will ultimately guide New Jersey’s practice change and is intended to yield improved \nresults for children and families. \n \nMethodology \nThe primary source of information for this Period II Report is the Department of Children and \nFamilies (DCF). DCF provides the Monitor with extensive aggregate and back up data as well as \naccess to staff at all levels to enable the Monitor to verify DCF data and report on actions taken \nand progress made. During this Monitoring period, the Monitor also visited seven Division of \n                                                 \n \n1 Charlie and Nadine H . et al. v.

SUMMARY OF PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES AHEAD \n \nSummary of Accomplishments \nThe past six months have been demanding for the relatively new Department of Children and \nFamilies (DCF) as it has moved to expand the range, scope and pace of its reform initiatives. \nDespite the complexity of the challenges and demands of widespread growth and change, DCF \nhas built considerably upon its accomplishments from the previous monitoring period. As shown \nin summary fashion in Table 1 on pages 8 to 12 and discussed in more detail in this report, DCF \nfulfilled and often exceeded the expectations of the MSA in each area in which the MSA called \nfor activity.  \n \nThis monitoring period covers additional Phase I commitments in which DCF continued to focus \non the development of leadership throughout the organization and on the fundamental building \nblocks which are the foundation of the overall reform effort. While keeping that focus, DCF has \nthoughtfully planned and begun to implement several major initiatives in this monitoring period \nwhich have promise to move the Department beyond building infrastructure and toward lasting \nsystemic change and better outcomes for children and families. \n \nHighlights of the Monitor’s assessment of progress include: \n \nThe Department has continued to make progress in developing the infrastructure necessary \nto create lasting reform. Examples include: \n \n•  DCF achieved or exceeded the June 2007 caseload targets set for Permanency, Intake \nand Adoption staff. In site visits in different parts of the State, staff consistently \nconfirm that their caseloads have improved markedly and that this reduction, in turn, \nhas improved their ability to perform their jobs. \n \n•  DCF exceeded the benchmark for the ratio of supervisors to workers. Eighty-seven \npercent (87%) of offices are in compliance with the requirement of a five to one \nsupervisory ratio. Having an adequate cadre of skilled supervisors is absolutely \nessential to the work ahead to improve direct practice with children and families. \n \n•  DCF continued to improve its ability to use data to monitor performance and \nexpanded the data provided to the public on its website. \n \n•  Following a pilot deployment in Ocean County beginning in April 2007, DCF \ninitiated Phase II of New Jersey SPIRIT in August—launching statewide a \ncomprehensive automated child welfare information system. In preparation for the \ndeployment, DCF trained over 5000 employees on how to use the system. Since \ndeployment, DCF has been operating an extensive help desk and support system to \nidentify and trouble-shoot problems and to alleviate the steep learning curve that is \ntypically associated with the introduction of these complex data systems. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 3 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n•  The Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) achieved the June 2007 target for \ntimely completion of investigations. By June 2007, IAIU was expected to complete \n80 percent of its investigations within 60 days of referral. On June 30, 2007, the State \nreported that IAIU had 373 open investigations. Of those, 332 (89%) had been open \nless than 60 days. These open cases reflect investigations in-progress on referrals \nfrom May and June. \n \n•  The Department succeeded in reaching or exceeding all of the expectations in the \nMSA pertaining to training.  \no  The Pre-Service training curriculum was modified to incorporate \nprinciples from the Case Practice Model (CPM); \n \no  Newly hired workers continue to be enrolled in Pre-Service training within \ntwo weeks of their start date; \n \no  All newly promoted supervisors have taken Supervisory Training; \n \no  All case carrying staff were trained in concurrent planning; \n \no  5,025 staff were trained on New Jersey SPIRIT; and \n \no  All existing DYFS and IAIU staff were trained on Intake and \nInvestigations, and new staff will now receive Intake training as part of the \nPre-Service training curriculum \n \nSimultaneously to focusing on fundamentals, the Department took important steps to \nfundamentally change the way it works with families in New Jersey. For example: \n \n•  DCF developed a thoughtful and ambitious Case Practice Model Implementation Plan \nto guide the Department’s multi-year reform work.  \n \n•  DCF developed a comprehensive plan to improve the health care delivery system for \nchildren in out-of-home placement. When fully implemented, this plan creates and \nresources Child Health Units in every DYFS office in order to coordinate care and \nprovide information and supports to parents and Resource Parents so that children are \nhealthy and able to thrive. The plan also expands access to medical and mental health \nproviders to ensure that each child’s developmental, health and mental health needs \nare appropriately assessed and met. \n \nFinding appropriate placements for children, while still a major challenge, was a significant \nfocus of the Department in the past six months and it achieved solid results. \n \n•  DCF exceeded its mandate to license 1030 non-kin Resource Family homes, licensing \n1287 new non-kin families between July 2006 and June 2007. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 4 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n•  At the same time, more children than ever before are placed permanently with \nappropriate relatives, allowing them to maintain important family connections. The \nnumber of children placed through subsidized kinship legal guardianship grew by 26 \npercent from 2,002 in 2006 to 2,515 by June 2007.  \n \n•  DCF directed significant resources to new programs to support adolescents, funding a \nyouth permanency demonstration project and adding 112 transitional living beds for \nolder youth. \n \n•  DCF contracted for additional in-state capacity to meet the treatment needs of \nseverely troubled children and youth that have in the past necessitated out-of-state \nplacement by the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS). When all \nof the programs are functioning, an additional 86 “specialty” treatment beds will be \navailable in the State of New Jersey. \n \nWhile there is a long way to go, there are promising data on some outcomes as the \nDepartment matures and meets or exceeds expectations in the MSA. \n \n•  The number of children supported in permanent families through adoption subsidies \nor kinship guardianship arrangements (13,244) as of August, 2007 exceeds the \nnumber of children in state custody in out-of-home placement (9,978). \n \n•  The Department finalized 634 adoptions as of June 30, 2007 and is on target to meet \nits 2007 goal of 1400 adoptions.  \n \n•  There is a consistent net increase in the number of Resource Families licensed each \nmonth, fueled by new resources and departmental improvements in the recruitment \nand licensing processes. In the first half of 2007, the net gain of Resource Families (a \ntotal of 667 families) tripled compared to FY 2006. \n \n•  As of July 2007, 92 percent of children entering out-of-home care received pre-\nplacement assessments conducted in non-emergency room settings. \n \nChallenges Ahead \nIn structuring Phase I and II of the MSA, the parties deliberately attempted to recognize that \nsystem reform is a long-term process. Pressures for a “quick fix” come from all fronts, and are \nfelt acutely by leadership, management, and the front lines of the workforce as well as by \nchildren and families. Despite the many accomplishments cited above, the state’s child welfare \nsystem does not consistently function well and the urgency of the reforms remains. At a number \nof site visits, the Monitor listened to staff’s understandable difficulty with the rapid pace of \nchange. Different offices are at different places in terms of readiness for system change \ndepending on how swiftly they have added staff, how new the staff are to the work, the strength \nof local leadership, and whether they have benefited from being one of the demonstration sites of \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 5 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \na new initiative. At the same time that some staff experience the changes as too much and too \nfast, some advocates and families wonder why problems remain and the reform is taking so long.  \n \nThe Commissioner has made a conscious effort to expand and strengthen the leadership team in \nTrenton and at the Area and Local Office Manager level in this monitoring period, but this is still \na work in progress. The leadership team is exceedingly strong in some areas, while there are \nother areas of weakness that continue to require attention as the Department’s reform work \ncontinues and accelerates. There have been two major leadership changes during this period with \nthe departure of the Director of the Child Welfare Training Academy (NJCWTA) and the \nDirector of the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS). The Director of \nAdministration has assumed responsibility for the management of the NJCWTA and an Acting \nDirector has been appointed to DCBHS while the search for a permanent Director is completed. \n \nA major challenge of the past year, which continues going forward, is completing the \nimplementation and user acceptance of New Jersey SPIRIT. During the past six months, the \ndaily demands to keep the project on track, respond to crises and ensure that the full deployment \nwas as positive as possible for both workers in the field and the public occupied an enormous \namount of leadership time and attention. The experience of most public child welfare systems \nimplementing data systems like SPIRIT suggests that the months following deployment are \ntypically as challenging as the months leading up to it. While it is true that staff have been \ntrained and that the information system is functioning generally well in most areas of the State, \nrealizing the intended benefits of SPIRIT will require consistent work over the next year or two. \nThere are system bugs to be worked out, processes and reports to be modified, glitches to be \nunstuck, workers to be retrained and most importantly, consistent attention by managers at all \nlevels on the need for proper data entry and on the use of the information for more effective case \nmanagement and performance monitoring. Implementing a new data system is an enormous \nundertaking. Constant attention will be required over the next several months in order for \nSPIRIT’s potential for management, data analysis and tracking to be fully realized. \n \nAs is clear from the Case Practice Model Implementation Plan discussed in detail in this report, \nimplementing the new CPM is another formidable challenge, but a fundamentally necessary one \nin order to produce lasting change. In the Monitor’s site visits, the inexperience of the workforce \nis readily apparent. Corroborated by the data on the number of new workers hired in the past year \nto 18 months, many offices are filled with workers who are either just completing training or \nhave recently moved out of trainee status. The importance of their attachment to high quality \nTraining Supervisors in their first few months was underscored by the workers who viewed the \nmentoring they received from those staff as essential for their successful transition to the job. As \nthe Department moves forward to operationalize a practice model which demands new ways of \nworking with families and with the community, training, support, coaching and mentoring will \nbe necessary for not only the new and inexperienced workers but also for veteran workers. The \ndemand for this kind of help is significant but it is hard to imagine the case practice \ntransformations taking root and flourishing without such investments. Further, in implementing \nthe Case Practice Model, the Department will need to consistently engage with and rely heavily \non its partners in the community and across the State.  \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 6 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nAnother challenge the Department will face in the coming months is implementing its newly \ncreated Health Care Plan—moving quickly to deploy the resources of the Health Care Units to \nthe field, ensuring that the provider capacity for comprehensive assessments and follow-up \ntreatment and care is developed, resourced and connected, and putting in place the data systems \nto track successful implementation. The shortage of willing providers for dental care must be \naddressed through both changed relationships and commitments and will also likely require a \nchange in Medicaid reimbursement.  \n \nA significant challenge for the Department in implementing both the Health Care Plan and the \nCase Practice Model is space constraints. At each site visit, the Monitor heard from every level \nof staff that more space is necessary to carry out the Department’s new initiatives. More space is \nneeded for nurses, for health care visits, for parent/child visits, for family team meetings and the \nlike. Further, as the Department has expanded so quickly, many of the newer local offices are \nlocated in places that are inaccessible by public transportation and sometimes far from the \nchildren and families the Department serves. The challenges of space (both the lack of \nappropriate space and the poor conditions of some offices sites) need to be approached with both \nshort-term and longer term solutions. This is an issue which DCF cannot solve on its own; it will \nrequire assistance from other parts of state government. \n  \nAn additional challenge is the Department’s work with older adolescents. The Department has \nmade notable progress in directing attention and resources to older youth in out-of-home care. \nHowever, this is a population that has been long neglected by system efforts. The Department \nhas amended policies and procedures, but will need to move beyond plans to action to ensure \nreal change for youth. \n \nDCF has a lot of hard work ahead to realize the vision of an integrated agency that meets the \nneeds of children and families in less categorical ways. While beginning steps have occurred to \nlink the work of the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), the Division of Child \nBehavioral Health Services (DCBHS) and the Division of Prevention and Community \nPartnerships (DPCP), much more will be required to move beyond artificial boundaries and \ndistinctions to better serve children and families. Further, in every site visit and despite the fact \nthat the Department has moved aggressively in this last year to increase contracted resources for \ncommunity-based services for families and children, staff report the difficulties they experience \nin gaining access to the services that families need in their communities. These include such \nbasic services as substance abuse treatment, help to secure safe housing, in-home counseling and \nfamily preservation services, mental health services and family support. The Governor and the \nLegislature should be commended for providing DCF sufficient resources to begin the work to \nexpand necessary community services and supports. Developing and sustaining an appropriate \nand complete service array across the State is likely however to require consistent and additional \nresource commitments over the next several years.  \n \nIn summary, the Department’s work in this monitoring period has been focused and productive. \nMany promising strategies have been introduced, which will need to be consistently translated \ninto new practices and accessible services on the ground for the Department to succeed in its \nmission of fundamentally changing how it works with children and families in New Jersey. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

CONTINUING TO BUILD A HIGH QUALITY WORKFORCE AND \n  MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE \n \nA.  Caseloads \n \nNew Jersey’s child welfare system cannot be expected to be successful unless and until it has a \nsufficient, stable and well-trained workforce. During this monitoring period, the Department \ncontinued to make exceptional progress toward achieving this goal. For years, excessively high \ncaseloads in DYFS were a visible problem and source of controversy. While there was unanimity \nthat caseloads were too high, the accuracy of data tracking and the high turnover of staff made it \ndifficult to assess and tackle the problem. A high priority for the Modified Settlement Agreement \n(MSA) is the accuracy and transparency of caseload data and steady and rapid progress toward \nreducing worker caseloads across the State. The Department continued to demonstrate progress \nin both of these areas in the past six months. As discussed below, the State has met or exceeded \neach of the staffing commitments of the MSA for this monitoring period. The support from the \nGovernor and the Legislature for the additional funds needed to hire the large number of case \nworkers and supervisors required to reduce caseloads has been critical to DCF’s success in this \narea. Continued support will be needed in subsequent monitoring periods to comply with \nadditional caseload reductions before the end of Phase I in December 2008. \n \nThe Monitor took several steps to verify independently the reported caseload information. First, \nthe Monitor and Department staff reviewed previous draft reports and the methodology used to \ncompute the caseloads as well as the process put in place for verifying and refining the caseload \nreporting. This included reviewing examples of communication between central office and local \nmanagers regarding the exception reporting. This review identified an average of 10 corrections \nper office that were needed to improve the accuracy of the caseload data. Types of corrections \nneeded included: \n \n•  Updating the appropriate program and personnel systems with worker leave \ninformation, updated trainee status, name spelling corrections, worker program area \n(i.e., intake, adoptions, permanency) Each of these corrections affect the “available \npool” of workers by which the caseload averages are calculated.  \n•  Correcting case assignments. \n \nIn addition to assessing the Department’s internal quality assurance on the accuracy of caseload \ndata, the Monitor collected information from the seven site visits and telephone interviews with \nlocal office managers in ten randomly selected offices. All personnel interviewed confirmed the \naccuracy of the Department’s reporting on caseload and the vast majority of staff highlighted the \npositive effects of recently reduced caseloads. This independent review confirmed the accuracy \nof the State’s caseload reporting for June 2007. The principal accomplishments regarding \ncaseloads include: \n \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 13 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n1.  The State has continued to track and publicly report caseload information.  \n \nDCF can now accurately track and report on worker and supervisor caseloads. The tracking \nsystem allows the Department to provide accurate and increasingly more detailed caseload \ninformation quarterly on its website (www.state.nj.us/dcf). March 31, 2007 caseload data was \nposted on the website in May 2007 and June 30, 2007 caseload data was posted in September \n2007. Additionally, caseloads for trainees in each unit are reported separately (MSA, Section \nII.E.2) and both levels of supervisory staff (SFSS1 and SFSS2) are separately counted and \nshown. \n \n2.  DCF exceeded the June 2007 caseload target for average caseloads of Permanency \nstaff. \n \nPermanency workers are assigned to provide case management of services to families whose \nchildren remain at home under the protective supervision of DYFS and those families whose \nchildren are removed from home due to safety concerns. To ensure staff has the time to devote to \nchildren and families with diverse needs and circumstances, the State agreed to achieve a \ncaseload standard that has two intertwined components. One component is the number of \nfamilies per worker and the other component is the number of children placed in out-of–home \ncare per worker. This has been referred to as a “two prong” standard. Permanency workers are to \nserve no more than 15 families and 10 children in out-of-home care. If either of these standards \nis higher, the caseload is not compliant with the Modified Settlement Agreement standard (MSA, \nSection II.E). \n \nDuring Phase I, caseload compliance is measured by average caseloads in an office. Ultimately, \nthe Phase I goal is for 95 percent of all offices to have permanency workers that meet the two-\npronged standard for average caseloads. This goal is to be achieved over a period of time with \ntargets starting in 2006, and with the final target of 95 percent to be achieved by December 2008. \nAs of June 2007, average caseloads in 79 percent of all local offices4 are to meet the caseload \nstandard. (MSA, Section II.E.9.) \n \nAs displayed in Figure 2, the State exceeded this target with 84 percent of the offices having \naverage caseloads for available Permanency workers of 15 families or fewer and 10 or fewer \nchildren in placement. The State also reported to the Monitor that less than one percent of all \ncase workers had caseloads of more than 30 families in June 2007. This data was independently \nverified by the Monitor as previously described. Appendix A contains a table with supporting \ndetail on caseloads for each local office. \n                                                 \n4 On June 30, 2007, there were 46 local offices. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

DCF exceeded the June 2007 caseload target for average caseloads of Intake staff. \n \nDYFS Intake staff is responsible for responding to community concerns regarding child safety \nand well-being. They take referrals from the State Central Registry and depending on the nature \nof the allegation, have 2 hours to 5 days to visit the home and begin their investigation and \nassessment under the MSA. They are to complete their investigation and assessment within 60 \ndays. The caseload standard for Intake staff also has two components. One component is the \nnumber of families under investigation or assessment at any given time and the other component \nis the number of new referrals assigned to a worker each month. When fully implemented in \nPhase II, intake workers are to have caseloads of 12 families or less and 8 new referrals or less \nper month. (MSA, Section III.E). The interim standard in Phase I is caseloads of 15 families or \nless and 10 or fewer new referrals per month. \n \nAs with the Permanency caseloads, the Phase I standard for Intake staff is based on average \ncaseloads in an office and by December 2008, the goal is for 74 percent of all offices to have \naverage caseloads for intake workers that meet the two-pronged standard. As of June 2007, 58 \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

(MSA, Section II.E.10) \n \nAs displayed in Figure 3, the State has exceeded this second target with Intake staff since \nDecember 2006. As of June 2007, 82 percent of the offices had average caseloads for Intake staff \nat or below the standard. This data was independently verified by the Monitor as part of the \npreviously described process.

DCF exceeded the June 2007 caseload target for average caseloads of Adoption staff. \n \nAdoption staff are responsible for moving children to permanency by developing adoptive \nresources and performing the work needed to finalize adoptions. The MSA requires the State to \nassign children with a goal of adoption to designated adoption workers (except in the small \nnumber of cases where there is a previously established relationship with a permanency \ncaseworker or other acceptable reason) (MSA, Section II.G). \n \nAs with the Permanency caseloads, by June 2008, the goal is for 95 percent of offices to have \naverage caseloads for Adoption staff of 18 or fewer children with a subset of 60 percent of the \noffices achieving average caseloads of 15 or fewer families (MSA, Section II.G.18).

DCF exceeded the benchmark for ratio of supervisors to workers. \n \nSupervision is a critical role in practice with children and families and the span of supervisor \nresponsibility should be limited to allow more effective individual supervision of workers. \nTherefore the MSA established standards for supervisory ratios. By December 2008, 95 percent \nof all offices should be able to maintain a five worker to one supervisor ratio (MSA, Section \nII.E.17). Like the caseload standards, this standard was to be phased in starting in December \n2006. As of June 2007, 85 percent of the offices were to have sufficient supervisory staff to \nmaintain a five worker to one supervisor ratio. (MSA, Section II.E.11)  \n \nAs displayed in Figure 5, the State exceeded the second target with 87 percent of the offices \nhaving 5 to 1 supervisory ratios. This ratio is calculated using only the SFSS2 staff.5  \n                                                 \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

One level, Supervising Family Service Specialist 2 (SFSS2), is a direct \nfrontline supervisor position responsible for supervising a casework unit. The field refers to this position as \n“supervisor” or “unit supervisor.” The second level is Supervising Family Service Specialist 1 (SFSS1). In the field, \nthis position is referred to as “Casework Supervisor.” In general, five unit supervisors typically report to a Casework \nSupervisor. Prior to the March 31, 2007 reporting, DCF had combined both casework supervisors and frontline \nsupervisors in the generic category of “supervisors” in the reported supervisor ratios. The web site posting now \nreflects the effect of disaggregating the supervisors. For purposes of meeting the Modified Settlement Agreement \nStandards of Supervisory ratios, only the number of unit supervisors (SFSS2) will be used going forward. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Local Office Insights and Comments about Caseloads  \n \nIn-person and telephone interviews with casework staff, supervisors and area and local office \nmanagement confirm that caseload sizes have substantially improved since March 2006 and \nhighlight caseload reduction as an area of significant progress. Even those offices that were not \nyet in compliance with all or some of the caseload standards have experienced notable \nreductions. When asked about the largest individual caseloads in June 2007, local office \nmanagement indicated some Permanency and Intake workers might have had caseloads as high \nas 18 to 28 families. Some individual adoption caseloads were as high as 20 children in some \noffices. Local office personnel also cited individual caseloads as low as 13 families and adoption \ncaseloads with no more than 9 or 14 children. Staff at many of the local offices visited \ncommented on caseloads being more manageable, producing less stress and allowing more \ncontact and better practice with children and families. Likewise, those workers who continue to \nhave higher caseloads report that they don’t have time “to do what we’re supposed to do.” \n \nB.  Training \n \nAs shown in Table 6, the State met each of its MSA obligations for training during this \nmonitoring period. Given the large numbers of new staff added to the workforce, this has not \nbeen an easy accomplishment. The state’s Director of the New Jersey Child Welfare Training \nAcademy (NJCWTA) resigned during this period. Until a new permanent Director is selected, \nthe NJCWTA is being managed by DCF’s Director of Administration.  \n \nHighlights of the Department’s work this monitoring period in training are: \n \n•  Modification of the Pre-Service training to incorporate principles from the Case \nPractice Model; \n•  All newly promoted supervisors have taken Supervisory Training; \n•  All staff were trained on concurrent planning; \n•  All case carrying staff, supervisors and others (5,025 staff) were trained on the State’s \nnew automated Child Welfare Information System, New Jersey SPIRIT; and \n•  Nearly all existing staff members were trained in Intake and Investigations; new staff \nmembers will henceforth receive Intake training as part of Pre-Service training.  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

DYFS revised its Pre-Service training to incorporate the new Case Practice Model \nand continues to provide a minimum of 160 hours of classroom training to newly \nhired staff. \n \nThe New Jersey Child Welfare Training Academy (NJCWTA) revised its Pre-Service \ntraining curriculum in this monitoring period to reflect the newly developed CPM. (MSA, \nII B.1.a) The new Pre-Service curriculum, entitled Family and Community Engagement \nTraining, contains concepts, strategies and skills building exercises on engaging families \nand communities. The Department will be working with consultants to review these \ninitial modifications to ensure they are consistent with changes to its In-Service and other \ntraining curricula and New Jersey’s new CPM is the organizing principle of all training \nofferings. The Monitor will be involved in this change process, and will evaluate \nrevisions to the Pre-Service and the In-Service training curricula in upcoming monitoring \nperiods.  \n \nThe Pre- Service curriculum as revised consists of 162 hours of training, 27 classroom \ndays and 21 field instruction days. Figure 7 below shows the 11 modules that comprise \nthe revised curriculum.  \n \nFigure 7:  \nNew Jersey Pre-Service Training Curriculum \n \n                 Orientation – Welcome to DCF \n  Module 1  Understanding Child Welfare in New Jersey \n  Module 2  Taking Care of Yourself \n  Module 3  Computer Applications \n  Module 4  Self-Aware Practitioner \n  Module 5  Focusing on Families: From Screening to Closing \n  Module 6  Engagement and Interpersonal Helping Skills \n  Module 7  Child Development and Identification of Child Abuse and Neglect \n  Module 8  Assessing Strengths and Needs of Families \n  Module 9  Facilitating Change \n  Module 10  Structured Decision Making (SDM) \n  Module 11  Simulation \n \nSource: NJCWTA as of June 2007 \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

All new case-carrying workers are enrolled in Pre-Service training within two weeks \nof their start date (MSA, II.B.1.b). \n \nDuring the monitoring period, the Department hired 392 staff as Family Service \nSpecialists. These 392 staff members as well as staff hired at the end of 20066 were \nrequired to take Pre-Service training. A total of 412 staff was enrolled in Pre-Service \ntraining between January and June 2007. The Monitor reviewed training logs of Pre-\nService training participation for the months of January 2007 to June 2007 and cross-\nreferenced human resource records with rosters of participants in Pre-Service training \nsessions conducted in the same period. This review established that 94 percent of \nDepartment trainees are enrolled in Pre-Service training within two weeks of their start \ndate as required by the MSA. The Monitor’s discussions with staff at various local offices \nthroughout the State reveal that the Pre-Service training is generally well received.  \n \nc.  DYFS revised and standardized its competency exams to better assess when new \nworkers are ready to assume a full case load (MSA, II.B.1.c). \n \nThe MSA requires the Department to have standardized exams to assess worker \ncompetency before assuming a full caseload. Trainees take competency exams associated \nwith each module of the Pre-Service training. In the first Monitoring Report, the Monitor \nrecommended the Department revise its protocol for certifying when a trainee can assume \na full case load. The NJCWTA developed a comprehensive tool to make this assessment, \nand has begun implementing it during this monitoring period. The new tool allows Field \nTraining Unit Supervisors and others to more effectively evaluate a trainee’s strengths \nand weaknesses, and make suggestions for areas of improvement. The Department will \ncontinue to evaluate whether the new assessment tool meets its need to effectively \nevaluate the competence of a new trainee.7 \n \n2.  In-Service Training \n \na.  The State has trained its staff on New Jersey SPIRIT as part of the requirement to \nbegin an In Service training program (MSA, II.b.2.a).  \n \nAt the conclusion of the last monitoring period, the parties agreed to permit the \nDepartment’s training of staff in New Jersey SPIRIT to satisfy the MSA requirement to \ninstitute In-Service training by April 2007. As discussed on page 29 of this Report, the \nDivision began training on New Jersey SPIRIT in April 2007 in Ocean County and with \nweb-based training throughout the State. By the end of August 2007 the State had trained \n5,025 staff on its new information technology system, including all of its 2,026 workers \nand 500 supervisors. \n                                                 \n6 412 staff includes 20 staff hired at the end of 2006 who were required to take Pre-Service training within two \nweeks of their start so were trained in the current monitoring period. \n7 The Monitor recommended that this instrument include a scaled grade rather than a pass/fail assessment in order to \nassist in evaluating staff development needs. The Department agreed re-evaluate this recommendation after gaining \nsome initial experience with the assessment process.  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

DYFS has provided in-service training on concurrent planning for existing staff \n(MSA, II.B.2.d). \n \nThe focus of concurrent planning is the development of permanency plans that \nincorporate reunification and long term planning in the event reunification is not possible. \nThe Department has implemented In-Service training on concurrent planning through its \ncontract with Rutgers University School of Social Work (Rutgers). In response to staff \nrequests, the Department conducted the Concurrent Planning training in a variety of \ndifferent locations and in local offices. As of June 30, 2007 the NJCWTA had recorded a \ntotal of 3,251 staff that Rutgers had trained. The Department reports all existing staff has \nnow been trained on concurrent planning. The Monitor cross referenced a random sample \nof 37 staff transcripts with human resource data and found that all existing staff had taken \nConcurrent Planning training.  \n \nThe Monitor attended the Department’s Concurrent Planning training in Hunterdon, N.J. \nStaff were engaged and responded with enthusiasm to the training. Particularly useful to \nstaff, as reported to the Monitor during site visits, was the consultant’s use of case \nhandlers’ real cases (without names) as learning tools to construct permanency plans and \ntasks. Moving forward, the Department will need to ensure that the presentation and \nsubject matter of the Concurrent Planning training conforms with more consistency and \nspecificity to the new CPM. \n \n3.   Intake and Investigations \n \na.  DYFS has trained nearly all existing staff members responsible for Intake and \nInvestigations and has incorporated Intake into its Pre-Service training for new staff \n(MSA, II.B.3.a,b). \n \nAs indicated in Table 6 above, the NJCWTA reports that it trained 1483 DYFS staff on \nIntake and Investigations, including 64 IAIU investigators between January and June \n2007. Now that training of existing Intake staff is complete, all staff newly responsible \nfor Intake and Investigations will be trained in these skills as part of their Pre-Service \ntraining. The Monitor cross referenced a random sample of 84 staff transcripts with \nhuman resource data and concluded that the State has complied with the MSA.  \n \nb.  DYFS developed and implemented a competency examination for all workers \nperforming Intake and Investigations, and has incorporated that material into its Pre-\nService testing (MSA, II.B.3.a). \n \nBased on pilot testing of competency exams with Intake and Investigations staff, the \nNJCWTA developed a competency examination for staff that complete the 3-day Intake \nand Investigations course. The Monitor has taken and reviewed the exam. Starting in \nJanuary 2007, the NJCWTA incorporated this exam into its testing of Modules 6, 9 and \npart of 8 of Pre-Service training, which cover Intake and Investigations.

The Department reports that there have been no second \nfailures of competency exams.  \n \n4.

The remaining 27 appointments had prior \nexperience and training as supervisors. To verify this data, the Monitor cross referenced a \nrandom sample of 15 staff transcripts with human resource data and concluded that the \nState has met the MSA requirement. It will be important for the Department to schedule \nthose supervisors who took their supervisory training in 2004-2005 for training on the \nnew CPM as soon as possible.8  \n                                                 \n8 Based on the Monitor’s random sample review of 15 staff, 4 staff took supervisory training in 2005 or earlier. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 24 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n  Supervisors appointed before December 2006 \nAs indicated in Tables 6 and 8, the Department reports that 138 supervisors appointed \nprior to December 2006 have taken supervisory training during this monitoring period; 5 \nsupervisors have not yet completed supervisory training but have been scheduled. The \nMonitor cross referenced a random sample of 21staff transcripts with human resources \ndata and concluded that the State has met the MSA requirement. It will be important for \nthe Department to schedule those supervisors who took supervisory training in 2004-\n2005 for training on the new CPM.9 Further, the Monitor’s independent review of class \nrosters for supervisory training against human resources reports of newly appointed \nsupervisors indicates that NJCWTA is providing supervisory training within 3 months of \nthe supervisor’s promotion.  \n \nAt the conclusion of the training, supervisors are expected to pass competency \nexaminations. During the last monitoring period, the Monitor reviewed samples of \nportions of supervisory competency examinations of varying quality and was not able to \nsatisfactorily assess how the results were evaluated and used. The Monitor has \nrecommended and is in discussion with DCF about the development of a more structured \nand standardized assessment of supervisory skills and the use of a more clearly defined \nprotocol for how the results of the exam are used to develop individual staff competency. \nThe Monitor will reevaluate this expectation in the next six-month period. \n \n                                                 \n9 Based on the Monitor’s random sample review of 21 staff, 3 staff appear to have received supervisory training in \nJanuary 2003. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (“IAIU”) \n \nThe Institutional Abuse Investigations Unit (IAIU) is responsible for investigating allegations of \nabuse and neglect in any out-of-home care setting. This includes, but is not limited to foster care \nplacement settings. It also includes correctional facilities, detention facilities, treatment facilities, \nschools (public or private), residential schools, shelters, hospitals, camps or day care centers that \nare licensed or should be licensed, Resource Family homes and registered family day care \nhomes.10 In the first half of 2007, IAIU received 1730 referrals.

IAIU Support Operations Manual, III E Institutional Abuse and Neglect, 302. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 26 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n1.  The IAIU achieved the June 2007 target for timeliness of IAIU Investigations. \n \nThe purpose of IAIU’s investigative effort is to determine whether children in out-of-home care \nsettings have been abused or neglected11 and to ensure their safety by requiring corrective actions \nto eliminate the risk of future harm. By June 2007, IAIU was expected to complete 80 percent of \nits investigations within 60 days of referral. (MSA, II.I.3)  \n \nOn June 30, 2007, the State reported that IAIU had 373 open investigations, 332 (89%) of which \nhad been open less than 60 days. These open cases reflect investigations still in process based on \nMay and June referrals. The remaining 11 percent had been open for more than 60 days. \nAccording to the State, a significant number of the cases that were open more than 60 days \ninvolve criminal investigations and the IAIU investigations were on hold until staff are given \nclearance from law enforcement or prosecution to proceed. \n \nIn addition to the month-end report supplied by the State, the Monitor reviewed randomly \nselected IAIU daily work-flow reports for ten days between July 1 and August 31, 2007. The \ntrend shown in these reports indicates that IAIU was able to maintain the performance achieved \non June 30, 2007 throughout July and August for all open reports. The proportion of cases open \nless than 60 days ranged from 83 percent to 88 percent. During the next period, the Monitor will \nreview a selection of investigation records to further validate the State’s performance. \n \n2.  By June 30, 2007 all IAIU investigators had received appropriate training. \n \nAll IAIU investigators are to have had specific training on the Intake and Investigations process, \npolicies, and investigative techniques. (MSA, III.I.4.) \n \nSixty-four IAIU staff statewide received the “First Responder” investigative training between \nJanuary and July 2007. DCF reports that this includes all IAIU supervisors. \n \n \nD.  Accountability through the Production and Use of Accurate Data \n \nOne of the principal accomplishments of the Department in its first year is its progress in \nproducing timely and accurate data, making that data available to the field and to the public and \nincreasingly using the data for planning, management and accountability.The importance of data \nfor planning and accountability has been consistently identified as a high leadership priority. The \nDepartment has begun to move from one which could not rely on or be relied on for accurate \ndata to one which has steadily improved its internal capacity and external communication \nthrough performance and outcome data. This has been the result of diligent work by the DCF \nOffice of Planning and Policy and the entire DCF leadership team.  \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the MSA required further development of data capacity in two \nmajor ways: \n                                                 \n11 As defined by statute at N.J.S.A. 30:40C-12 or 9:6-8.21. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 27 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n \n•  The expansion of production and publication of accurate data on key indicators of \nsystem performance and \n•  The deployment of New Jersey SPIRIT, the State’s Automated Child Welfare \nInformation System (SACWIS).  \n \nEach of these is discussed separately below.  \n \n1.  DCF continues to expand and refine its data on performance indicators and its \npresentation of data to the public through its website.  \n \nWith the full deployment of New Jersey SPIRIT (discussed in more detail below), the State is \npoised to significantly expand the number and range of indicators on which it routinely collects \nand can report data. It is important to note that it will take time to achieve the expanded data \nreporting capacity of SPIRIT since producing accurate reports through a new data system require \nthat staff learn to properly use the system to its full potential. Nevertheless, in this monitoring \nperiod and prior to full deployment of SPIRIT, DCF was able to continue to expand its data \ncapacities and has made several modifications and additions that satisfy the MSA requirement to \ncontinue to expand performance reporting (MSA, II.J.5).  \n \nImportant additions in DCF’s Quarterly Data Update include:  \n \n•  Demographic Data \no  Children in DYFS Placement by Placement Type  \n(with separate delineation of treatment home placements)  \no  Race/Ethnicity of Children Receiving DYFS Services  \n(broken out by Placement and In-Home) \no  Age and Gender of Children Receiving DYFS Services  \n(broken out by Placement and In-Home) \no  Age, Race/Ethnicity and Gender of Children Served by DCBHS  \n(broken out by CMOs, and DCBHS placements  \n•  Caseload Data \no  Staff with more than 30 Families \no  Caseload Data by Local Office \n•  Recruiting Foster and Adoptive Families  \no  Data on Licensed Resource Homes (Kin and Non-Kin separately)  \no  Net Gain on Resource Families (Kin and Non-Kin)  \n•  Health Care for Children in Placement \no  Performance on Pre-Placement Assessments \n \nOver the next year, it is the Monitor’s expectation that the range of data elements that can be \naccurately collected and reported will substantially increase. Moreover, the monitoring \nrequirements related to implementation of the CPM will require tracking of additional indicators \nand case processing functions that are not now captured. The Monitor will be working with DCF \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 28 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nstaff to identify a timetable and plan for additional data measurement and reporting. Discussions \nbetween the Monitor, Plaintiffs and State will occur by December 2007 to reach agreement on a \nplan for additional data rollout beginning in 2008.  \n \n2.  Deployment of Phase II of New Jersey SPIRIT \n \nThe MSA required the deployment of Release 2, Phase II of New Jersey SPIRIT by February \n2007 (MSA, II.J.7). In the last monitoring report, the release date for SPIRIT was modified to \nApril 2007 in order to avoid possible disruptions in end of fiscal quarter and programmatic \nreporting. The State then wisely decided to implement SPIRIT by first piloting the deployment in \nOcean County and using the experience there to identify and fix problems that would cause \nmajor disruption if the system was initially implemented statewide. Postponement of full \ndeployment to the summer of 2007 also enabled the Department to have sufficient time to \nprovide initial training for each of its staff. \n \nThe decision to pilot test the release in Ocean County was a good one. The Monitor visited \nOcean County during the pilot phase and heard from staff about the promises, irritations, and \nchallenges of SPIRIT. During the pilot phase, many, many case processing and system problems \nwere identified by users and fixed. In addition, the Department gained critical insight into the \nlevel of on-site and on-line support that would be needed for full deployment. During the pilot \nperiod, data were double entered into the new SPIRIT system and into the old legacy system so \nas to avoid the possibility of lost data.  \n \nNew Jersey SPIRIT was deployed statewide on August 22, 2007. Department leadership \napproached the deployment with both careful planning and some understandable trepidation. In \nadvance of the deployment, all staff was trained in how to log onto and use SPIRIT for case \nprocessing functions, thus meeting the MSA requirement to train all case carrying workers \n(MSA, II.J.8). In addition, DCF established a centralized help desk consisting of 13 employees \nand put 176 “production support staff” in the field throughout all 46 local offices and in central \noffice units. The need for this kind of intensive on-site help is well documented in other States’ \nexperiences with information system deployment. In the period between August 22 and \nSeptember 5, the Department reports that the Helpdesk responded to 1905 different requests for \nassistance, reflecting the ongoing challenge of acclimating staff to a new system, making sure \nthat all system problems are identified and resolved and the need for continuous implementation \nmonitoring and training. However, implementation problems still remain and significant on-site \nhelp will continue to be needed in some areas of the State for the foreseeable future. \n \nA second hurdle for the new system was the processing of its first set of monthly payments. This \ntask was also approached with trepidation but it appears that the payment processing parts of \nSPIRIT are functioning. DCF implemented back up systems to process manual payments when \nneeded to supplement automatic payments through SPIRIT. A hotline was established for \nproviders and Resource Parents in the event that payments were improperly made. In the first run \nof payments, 85% were made automatically. In the second run at the beginning of October, less \nthan 1% of payments required manual processing.  \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 29 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nThe deployment of New Jersey SPIRIT is a significant accomplishment. Diligent oversight and \nlocal office support will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the \nimplementation to date reflects the enormously hard work and attention of DCF managers and \nSPIRIT staff in the months leading up to and immediately upon deployment. The real test of the \nsystem’s functionality will occur over the next six months to a year as workers get used to and \nare required to use the system and as managers learn to use SPIRIT and its data for tracking \nindividual cases and for overall system and performance monitoring. The Monitor will more \nfully assess New Jersey SPIRIT implementation in the next six months.  \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 30 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nIV.  CHANGING PRACTICE TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES \n \nA.  Implementing the New Case Practice Model \n \nThe Department faced significant challenges in communicating and disseminating the new Case \nPractice Model (CPM) to the field, but has responded to this challenge with a detailed, \nthoughtful and ambitious CPM Implementation Plan. The Plan incorporates broad and deep \nstrategies that seek to use the CPM as a dynamic tool to frame and guide future work. The \nconceptualization of this Plan took time to develop, and the Monitor has consistently taken the \nposition that rather than rush through a truncated version of a CPM training to meet the MSA \ntimeframes, the State should approach the execution of the CPM Implementation Plan as a \nlonger term and intensive process. The parties have agreed, therefore, to extend the deadline to \ncomplete staff training and mentoring on the CPM until the end of 2008 with intensive work \nbeginning in October 2007 and continuing over the next 15 months. \n \nIn this monitoring period, the MSA (II.A.3-4) required the State to: \n•  Begin to implement the CPM \n•  Identify the methodology to track successful implementation of the CPM; \n \nIn reporting on the CPM for Phase I of the MSA, the Monitor is charged with focusing \n“primarily on the quality of the Case Practice Model and the actions taken to implement it.” \n(MSA, II.A.5). \n \nAfter its finalization in December 2006, the work of planning for implementation of the CPM \nbegan. With the Monitor’s support, the Department took the necessary time to lay the foundation \nfor a healthy and functioning department before it turned its attention to planning for \nimplementation of the new CPM. These foundational steps included: \n•  Hiring large numbers of case-carrying staff to meet the needs of each office; \n•  Training staff, including Pre-Service, Investigatory, Supervisory, and New Jersey \nSPIRIT; \n•  Compliance with caseload standards to meet the MSA; \n•  Setting challenging adoption finalization targets; \n•  Reorganization of Resource Family licensing and recruitment units to meet \naggressive new family recruitment targets. \n \n \nOnce these critical elements of a healthy system were underway, the Department began to focus \non meeting its mandate to implement the CPM. Site visits reveal that some offices have begun to \ncommunicate and anticipate the change of practice envisioned in the CPM while others have not. \nIn the Monitor’s site visits, many staff however expressed excitement about a new vision for the \nagency and the new role the agency will be expected to take in the community and in partnership \nwith families and community stakeholders. Other staff had little to no knowledge of the \nDepartment’s CPM and its expectations for practice. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 31 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nAs described in detail in the Department’s CPM Implementation Plan dated September 2007 \n(Appendix B), the first formal step towards implementation of the CPM began with a series of \nfocus groups of staff, stakeholders and families. Key Department leadership, including Area \nDirectors and Assistant Area Directors, then met in a two day retreat devoted to CPM \nimplementation. Each division and level of DCF had an opportunity to express what it needed in \norder to successfully implement the new CPM, and leadership had the opportunity to hear, \nanalyze and reflect upon those needs. The Monitor attended this retreat as an observer. \n \nThe Department’s CPM Implementation Plan articulates a six prong approach to system change: \n1.  Leadership Development \n2.  Statewide Readiness Strategy \n3.  Immersion \n4.  Service Development \n5.  Continued Focus on the Fundamentals \n6.  Enhanced Planning Between DYFS and DCBHS \n \nEach prong is important and necessary for the overall reform effort.  \n \n1.  Leadership Development \n \nSound reform requires a cultural change that begins with leadership engagement and \ndevelopment. Executive leadership made a critical determination early on to involve Area \nDirectors, Assistant Area Directors—and later office managers—in the decision-making and \nleadership of the reform effort. This is not easy to do given the size of New Jersey’s child \nwelfare system, and DCF should be commended in taking this step even before it could reap any \ndirect benefits. In addition to regular meetings and better communication strategies generally, \nCentral Office made critical data available to each director and manager for the first time and \nsupported and encouraged directors and managers to make management decisions based on this \ndata. The next step is a Leadership Summit to take place in October 2007 with key staff from \nDYFS, DCBHS, Prevention and Central Operations, DCF Executive Management and the Child \nWelfare Policy and Practice Group (CWPPG), a consultant group which was an important \ninnovator and leader in Alabama and Utah’s model child welfare reform efforts. \n \n2.   Statewide Readiness Strategy \n \nBy December 2007, the Department will have developed training curricula consistent with the \nCPM and will begin to intensively provide additional training to existing staff. Concurrently, \nDCF will again review and modify its Pre-Service curriculum to ensure consistency and to \nenhance necessary skill development. This work will be shared with the New Jersey Partnership \nfor Child Welfare Program, a partnership of four regionally diverse schools of social work \nfacilitated by Rutgers University School of Social Work. The chosen curricula will cover the \nprinciples of family engagement, while giving the staff practical tools for beginning to practice \nkey principles. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 32 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nTraining staff on the CPM is a formidable task. DCF estimates that in 2008 at least 4000 case \ncarrying staff will need to be trained for a minimum of 40 hours. Over 1,100 days of training—\nassuming a class size of 25—will need to be scheduled and delivered. To accomplish this task, \nthe Department has developed a matrix relying on regional training teams that will include:  \n•  the DCF Child Welfare Training Academy (NJCWTA); \n•  the University Training Consortium, facilitated by Rutgers University  \nSchool of Social Work; \n•  a DYFS central office CPM technical assistance group; \n•  local providers, such as local CMOs who have experience and proven track records of \nfamily engagement and family centered practice; and \n•  consultant team members (CWPPG). \n \nThe regional teams will be deployed sequentially across the State as explained below and in \ndepth in the Implementation Plan. The Department will utilize a train the trainer model so that, at \nthe conclusion of the consultant’s work with the State, the regional teams can seamlessly \ncontinue training the workforce as needed. \n \n3.  Immersion \n \nAt the same time the regional teams are training the statewide workforce, the Department will \nwork more intensively with staff at carefully chosen sites to more fully develop new skills and \npractices. As discussed in detail in the Implementation Plan, beginning in January 2008, DCF \nwill launch this intensive immersion process in four pilot counties. This process will provide \nintensive training, mentoring, and coaching for staff conducted by CWPPG and DCF technical \nassistance partners. It will also involve an examination of services available to families and, \nequally important, the development of an infrastructure to schedule and facilitate family team \nmeetings. The Monitor heard from all levels of staff at all sites that a lack of appropriate space \nhindered their ability to provide families with proper, dignified team meetings and visits. This \nissue will have to be addressed in the immersion sites and hopefully will yield creative solutions \nincluding community-based options for these sites and for other parts of the State. \n \nThe intensive coaching and mentoring of staff envisioned by the Implementation Plan takes time \nto implement correctly and to seed the foundation for lasting change. The process of developing \nimmersion sites is expected to take approximately seven months to complete. DCF has \ncommitted to an evaluation process to determine efficacy and the Monitor will be a partner in \nthat process. \n \nAs the immersion sites develop, local office leadership will conduct training and focused \ncoaching to ready the rest of the workforce. Advanced case practice training and advanced \nintensive coaching will be made available to staff across the state as local training capacity and \ntechnical assistance are developed by the second half of 2008. The Department will then stagger \nadvanced training and coaching as needed. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 33 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n4.   Service Delivery and Budget Transparency \n \nDuring site visits, the Monitor heard from staff about the need for more services that better align \nwith the needs of children and families and with the vision of the CPM. Without a sufficient \nquantity and quality of services, a case practice model will fail; staff cannot successfully engage \nwith families if they cannot offer them the services they need. Family teams cannot successfully \nassist families unless willing, trained and capable partners are members of the team.  \n \nOver this past year, DCF has begun investing in service capacity and as discussed later in the \nreport, has been using contracts with private providers as a means to expand local capacity for \nservices to children and families. These include investments in three pilot sites implementing \nnew differential response systems as well as resources for flexible funds to support family \nservices, visitation support services, family success centers, substance abuse treatment, domestic \nviolence treatment services and other service enhancements.12 The State is also actively \nimplementing a Strengthening Families child abuse prevention initiative which seeks to build \nservices and supports around families through early care and education programs.  \n \nFor the first time in the history of the Department, DCF is implementing a strategy of child and \nfamily-based budgeting of investments and services by immersion site. In order to create such a \nbudget, the Department will first inventory, across all its divisions, the public and private \ninvestments it makes in each of the sites where the CPM immersion is underway. This is an \ninnovative undertaking that will likely deliver critical information to the State to assist in \ndeveloping more family centered service delivery models and for future resource planning and \ndevelopment. \n \n5.   Continued Focus on Fundamentals \n \nIn its CPM Implementation Plan, the Department stresses the importance of continuing to keep \nits attention on the fundamentals of the reform, while simultaneously rolling out major new \ninitiatives such as the CPM. By a continued and simultaneous focus on the fundamentals, DCF \nwill continue to devote attention and resources to actions including reducing caseloads, retaining \nqualified staff, improving recruitment and licensing of resource homes. Continued progress on \nfundamentals will require recognition, cooperation, and support from stakeholders to ensure that \ncore elements of the reform remain center stage as the CPM implementation is underway. \n \n6.  Enhancing Planning and Coordination between DYFS and DCBHS \n \nIn 2006, the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS) held a series of focus \ngroups with system partners, including Family Court judges, Mobile Response and Stabilization \nServices, Family Support Organizations, Youth Case Management (YCM), and Care \nManagement Organizations (CMO) to discuss how to better serve families with the behavioral \nhealth system. A consistent message was that children’s behavioral health needs must be better \nintegrated into the daily work of the Department. \n                                                 \n12 The monitor intends to review the use of flexible funds in future monitoring reports. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 34 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n \nIn response, DCF will pilot reforms to unify case practice in DYFS and DCBHS in up to three \ncounties in Spring 2008. The purpose of the pilots will be to test the elimination of dual case \nmanagement within DCBHS, between YCMs and CMOs, and between DCBHS and DYFS by \ntransitioning youth to the most appropriate entity. DYFS will be the lead on all cases that involve \nsafety and permanency, but will continue to be supported by DCBHS. \n \nAnother component of the plan is DCBHS case management entities will deploy clinical staff \ninto DYFS local offices to provide technical and other assistance to DYFS staff. DCBHS will \nalso assign staff to DYFS Area Offices to become part of the team that works to return youth \nfrom out-of-home care. Taken together, these innovations are designed to improve the \ncoordination of services within the Department and to better serve children with behavioral \nhealth needs. The Monitor will be looking closely at these improvements and the progress the \nDepartment anticipates as a result of them in the next monitoring period.  \n \n7.  Implementation Plan Evaluation \n \nThe MSA requires the Department and the Monitor to track the implementation of the CPM \ngoing forward. Specifically, during Phase I the Monitor must evaluate and report “primarily on \nthe quality of the Case Practice Model and the actions taken to implement it.” (MSA, II.A.5). \nThe Monitor strongly supports the Department’s decision to track the implementation of the \nCPM through Quality Service Reviews (QSRs). The Department will also be collecting \nlongitudinal outcome data such as the data developed for DCF by the Chapin Hall Center for \nChildren. Quality Service Reviews will be phased in over time according to a schedule to be \ndeveloped by DCF and the Monitor. The schedule will phase in QSRs throughout the State, \nbeginning with the immersion sites. DCF offered suggestions for monitoring the State’s CPM \nimplementation in its CPM Implementation Plan. The Monitor will take these suggestions into \nconsideration in developing, with DCF and Plaintiffs, a comprehensive method of measuring \nwhether the CPM has successfully taken hold in New Jersey.  \n \nB.  Improving Results for Permanency and Adoption \n \nOver the last several months, DCF has dramatically increased its efforts to move more children \nout of foster care, whether through safe reunification, placement with an adoptive family or \nplacement in the permanent legal custody of an appropriate kinship family. The MSA requires \nDYFS to engage in several activities to promote permanency. Adoption units have been \nreconstituted and appropriate cases have been assigned to these units. Specific targets were set \nfor each local office to ensure that DYFS meets the MSA requirement of 1400 adoption \nfinalizations. Further, in an effort to change practice at the front end of the child welfare system, \nDYFS developed and implemented the Concurrent Planning “Enhanced Review” Model in ten \ndemonstration sites. Concurrent planning is a concept employed by jurisdictions throughout the \ncountry in which workers assist children who come into out-of-home placement to reunify with \ntheir family of origin safely and quickly, while simultaneously pursuing alternative permanent \nplacements for these children should reunification efforts fail. DCF describes concurrent \nplanning as “a child-focused practice meant to minimize placement trauma and repetitive moves \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 35 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nfor children entering care.”13 As DCF prepares to implement the CPM statewide, much planning \nand coordination will be necessary to help offices and workers understand that concurrent \nplanning is a critical part of the CPM. Concurrent planning practice will “roll out” statewide with \nthe implementation of the CPM.  \n \nIt is also noteworthy that DCF has organized its policies and practices to heighten attention to \nidentifying permanent homes for older adolescents in its care. Specifically, in accordance with \nthe MSA, DCF targeted its efforts to find permanent homes for 100 youth in care who have been \nwaiting the longest for a permanent family. DCF also launched a Youth Permanency Project to \nidentify permanent, life-long connections for youth who are transitioning out of the foster care \nsystem.  \n \n1.  Through adoption units, DCF continues to finalize adoptions at a steady pace. \n \nAs required by the MSA (Section II.G.12), DCF reports that all local offices have transferred \nappropriate cases to the adoption units. Reportedly, 95 percent of all adoption cases are now with \nadoption workers while 5 percent of cases remain in permanency units (due to an acceptable \nexception such as a previously established relationship with a caseworker). From January 2007 \nto June 30, 2007, DCF finalized 634 adoptions.14 The MSA requires 1400 adoptions to be \nfinalized by December 2007. (Section II.G.17). Although DCF was less than halfway to this \ntarget, the State is operating at a steady pace to reach this goal. By comparison, in 2006 DCF had \nfinalized 586 adoptions by June and ultimately finalized 1402 adoptions by December.15  \n \nSpecific adoption finalization goals now have been set for each local office based on their \ncurrent placement rates.16 Currently, eight Adoption Expeditors are working in counties with \nhigh numbers of legally free children (Essex, Union, and Ocean counties) to help those offices \nmeet these targets. Two other counties (Middlesex and Bergen) have permission to hire \nExpeditors should they require assistance. \n \n                                                 \n13 DCF, Concurrent Planning, Enhanced Review Model, update prepared 1/3/2007. \n14 New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Quarterly Update, September 5, 2007. \n15 The monitor previously reported 1,387 children had finalized adoptions. Because adoption data takes time to \nverify, a few more adoptions were finalized in 2006 but not reported before the monitoring report was issued. The \nfinal number of finalized adoptions in 2006 was 1402. The Monitor believes DCF can meet the MSA requirement of \n1400 cases because, according to DCF, the second half of the year is strongest for finalizing adoptions as a result of \nactivities during National Adoption Month in November. \n16 The formula for adoption finalizations each office was: 90% of children already in adoptive placements + 80% of \nchildren in foster homes with an adoptive interest + 70% of children in kin homes with an adoptive interest. \nAdditionally, 30% of children for who termination of parental rights process is underway will achieve the \ncompletion of litigation and finalization of adoption. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 36 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n2.  DCF launched 10 Concurrent Planning Enhanced Review demonstration sites and has \nbegun to assess their progress through the use of the Adoption Process Tracking \nSystem. \n \nThe MSA requires DCF to improve concurrent permanency planning and adoption practice \n(Section II G.1 and 2). DCF began implementation of the concurrent planning process in ten \ndemonstration sites this year. DYFS staff in these sites have received specific training on this \nnew model and follow-up coaching focusing on developing appropriate case plans for families. \nIn June 2007, a concurrent planning handbook for DYFS staff was completed. This handbook \ndescribes the concurrent planning process and provides checklists and other documents that help \nguide a worker’s decision-making process. Additionally, the Deputy Attorney Generals who \nhandle DYFS cases in these demonstration sites have received training and have begun to \nparticipate in the 10-month review hearings where a decision is made to provide more time for \nreunification with parent(s) or to recommend the termination of parental rights (TPR). \n \nCurrently, DCF is relying on the Adoption Process Tracking System to evaluate compliance with \nthe concurrent planning model. The tracking system records 5 and 10 month reviews, the \ntimeliness of case transfers to adoption workers, and the termination of parental rights. It is the \nresponsibility of the Area Concurrent Planning Specialists to ensure that case information is \nentered promptly into the tracking system. As concurrent planning expands statewide, the \nmeasurements currently captured by the adoption process tracking system will be captured by NJ \nSPIRIT and/or Safe Measures. \n \nIn the first six months of implementing the concurrent planning process, the demonstration sites \nhave experienced a not unexpected variety of successes and challenges. In most offices, staff \nwere able to complete the majority (90% or higher) of 5 month reviews within the necessary time \nframe. However, offices varied more dramatically in their ability to successfully complete the \n10-month reviews. Seven offices had timely 10 month reviews for 75 percent of their cases or \nhigher, while two offices held timely reviews in less than 40 percent of their cases. The prompt \ntransfer of cases (within 5 days) to an adoption worker also varied by office. Five offices \nachieved the timely transfer 100 percent of the time, while 4 offices had rates that ranged from \n11 to 50 percent. Finally, a total of 45 cases were supposed to have TPR petitions filed within 45 \ncalendar days, but this goal was only achieved in 14 cases (31%).  \n \n3.  Services to support reunification have been expanded. \n \nRecognizing the importance of providing services to parents whose children are in out-of-home \ncare, DCF awarded $6 million in contracted services for family engagement and therapeutic \nvisitation across the State—$575,000 of this award was dedicated to private agencies to work \nwith the 10 demonstration sites to facilitate family engagement meetings. Additionally, as \nrequired by the MSA, the State amended its policies and procedures to allow for the use of \nflexible funds to support family preservation and reunification efforts, increasing the amount of \nexpenditures on each parent annually and extending the time period for the use of these funds \n(Section II.C.3). The FY 2008 budget includes an additional $1 million for flexible funds. Given \nthe heightened effort to work with families, the Monitor recommends that DCF continue to track \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 37 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nand report on reunification rates as part of the concurrent planning process and on the use of \nflexible funds to support family reunification. \n \n4.  DCF has begun implementing permanency strategies for older youth in care. \n \na.  DCF is making progress to identify permanency options for youth who are legally \nfree for adoption and have been in care for long periods of time (“100 Longest \nWaiting Teens”). \n \nSpecific attention has been paid over the last six months to finding permanent homes for \nyouth in the foster care system who are legally free with adoption as their permanency \ngoal. The total number of legally free youth awaiting adoption has declined from 2278 in \nJanuary 2006 to 1939 in January 2007 and was 1740 in August 2007. Slightly more than \n400 legally free children require DYFS to locate a permanent home for them—through \nthe work of “Impact” Recruiters and select home adoption staff. In January 2007, five \nAdoption Impact Recruiters were hired and trained to find permanent connections for \nyouth who have been identified as part of the “100 Longest Waiting Teens.” These \nworkers, skilled in working with adolescents, are supervised by the Statewide Adoption \nRecruitment Specialist in the Office of Adoption Operations. Over the last six months, \nthey have received specific training on working with adolescents who have been in care \nfor extended periods of time and on strategies for recruiting appropriate families for these \nyouth17.  \n \nAccording to DCF, the 100 youth who have been waiting the longest for permanent \nhomes and are being targeted by the Adoption Impact teams are primarily African \nAmerican (89 youth), with a little over half of them boys (59 boys and 41 girls). Most of \nthe youth are between the ages of 14-16 (72 youth)18, and 70 percent of them live in \nhighly structured group homes, treatment homes, or residential settings. The median \nlength of stay for youth in out-of-home care is eight years (with the length of time \nranging from 3 years to 16 years). These youth have many educational and mental health \nchallenges related to being in care for so long and experiencing multiple placement \nmoves. \n \nAdoption Impact Recruiters have employed many strategies for finding potential \npermanent placements for these youth. Recruiters have “mined” the case files of youth in \ncare and had conversations with the youth about individuals to whom they feel \nconnected. Workers have tracked down family members or family friends to assess them \nas possible permanent caregivers. Some youth have chosen to participate in the Heart \nGallery, a recruitment strategy where professional photographers take pictures of children \nin need of adoptive homes. 115 youth were featured in the Heart Gallery this year; 29 are \nteens who are part of the “100 Longest Waiting” group. Eight other children have had \nother media exposure including newspaper articles and television appearances on \n                                                 \n17 This training was also offered to local office recruitment and adoption staff. \n18 There are some latency age youth who are part of a sibling group that includes an adolescent. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

DCF is also in the process of developing a Speaker’s Bureau of \nteens who can talk to other youth and potential adoptive parents about the need for homes \nfor older youth in care.  \n \nDCF is adapting policy and practice to be flexible and responsive to meeting the needs of \nyouth. For example, DCF recognizes that many foster parents might be willing to serve as \na permanent resource for older youth. However, foster parents currently receive a foster \ncare board rate until the child is 21, but if they were to adopt the child, the adoption \nsubsidy only continues until the child is 18. As a result, DCF is working to identify and \neliminate barriers to extending adoption subsidies to age 21 for youth who are adopted \nafter the age of 14.  \n \nTable 10 summarizes the progress made by the Adoption Impact Teams in finding \npermanent homes for the “100 Longest Waiting Teens.” \n \nTable 10:  \nProgress on Permanency for “100 Longest Waiting Teens” \n   \nPermanency activity  Number of youth benefited \nFinalized Adoption  1 \nSelected Home Adoption Placements  2 \nFoster Home Adoption Plan  7 \nRelative Adoption Placement  2 \nRelative Adoption Placements Pending  9 \nKinship Legal Guardianship Plan  2 \nAdoption Home study in progress  2 \nReconnecting with Birth Parents  2 \nVisiting (possible placement)  2 \nOther possible placement identified19  10 \nMatch Party Matches  5 \nSource: DCF, Longest Waiting Teens Report, Updated 9-6-07 \n  Children are counted in one category only. \n                                                 \n19 “Other possible placements” is a category that encompasses viable adults who are being assessed as a possible \nplacement for a youth. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

DCF is launching a Youth Permanency Demonstration Project.  \n  \nDCF began a Youth Permanency Demonstration Project to address the problem of too \nmany youth leaving the foster care system without permanent connections to caring \nadults. This project is “designed to combine independent living and youth development \nskills with extensive permanency planning.” Beginning July 1, 2007, DCF will work with \nthree agencies to support permanency planning for approximately 60-75 youth. Youth \nreferred to these agencies will be between the ages of 14 and 21. Some youth will be \n“legally free” and some “not-legally free” for adoption. The agencies’ success will be \nmeasured by the number of connections established for youth. Additional outcomes to be \nmeasured include: youth-adult connections still existing one year later, 80 percent of \nyouth with some viable means of support (employment skills), and improvements in the \nyouth’s sense of well being.  \n \nDCF will also begin working with youth who are at risk of aging out of the child welfare \nsystem without any permanent connection, and whose goal is neither adoption nor legal \nguardianship. DCF has begun using the Wendy’s Wonderful Kids model to assist with \nyouth-specific recruitment to find permanency for these youth. This model has been used \non a smaller scale in a few offices and will be expanding as services to adolescents \nexpand. Both of these projects demonstrate the State’s commitment to finding permanent \nhomes and/or adult connections for older youth in its custody. Further, these projects are \npart of a larger effort to improve practice with adolescents in DCF’s care. \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Resource Families \n \nRecruitment and licensure of Resource Families has improved in the past year. Many changes \nhave been made both structurally and substantively that have begun to bear fruit in this \nmonitoring period. Impact Teams deployed statewide have been successful in reducing the \nbacklog of waiting applications and the Department has licensed a record number of new homes. \nThe Department licensed 1287 new non-kin Resource Family homes, significantly exceeding the \nMSA requirement to have licensed 1030 non-kin Resource Family homes by June 2007. Further, \nthe Department now routinely achieves a net gain of Resource Homes each month, \ndemonstrating the increasing success of recruitment and licensing efforts.  \n \n1.  DCF recruited and licensed 1287 new non-kin Resource Families between July 2006 \nand June 2007 exceeding its mandate to license 1030 non-kin Resource Family homes \nin this period. (MSA, II.H.10.) \n \nThe State licensed a total of 643 non-kin Resource Family homes from July 2006 through \nJanuary 2007. This put the Department in very good stead to exceed its goal of licensing 1030 \nnon-kin Resource Family homes by June 2007. Indeed, as early as April 2007, the goal of 1030 \nhomes was met and by June 2007, a total of 1287 homes were recruited and licensed (see Figure \n11). \n \nFigure 11: NJ DCF Resource Families \nNumber of New Non-Kin Families Licensed \n1400\n1287\n1185\n1200\n1059\n1030\n1000 937\n802\n800\n690\n600\n508\n426\n400 345\n260\n200 161\n0\n0\nJuly 2006 Aug 2006 Sep 2006 Oct 2006 Nov 2006 Dec 2006 Jan 2007 Feb 2007 Mar 2007 Apr 2007 May 2007 Jun 2007 T A R GET\n \n     Source: New Jersey DCF, DYFS, verified by Monitor \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

The Resource Family Support and the Resource \nFamily Licensing units of DCF are to be applauded for this tremendously successful effort. First, \nthe Impact Teams established at the end of the last monitoring period moved into high gear \nbeginning in January 2007. Working jointly with Resource Family Units first in Middlesex, \nPassaic and Atlantic counties, and then moving on to Union and Burlington counties, the teams \nvastly reduced the backlog of waiting applications and licensed a record number of homes so that \nthere has been a consistent monthly net increase in the number of new homes.

Corzine     Page 44 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nResource Family Impact Teams developed a protocol for Resource Family Licensing staff to join \nResource Family Workers in the inspection of homes. Monthly meetings between the two units \nare now an expectation. At the monthly meetings, outstanding licensing issues are discussed and \nare moved toward resolution. Resource Family Licensing staff are now routinely assigned to \ngeographic areas and therefore have relationships with Resource Family Workers that did not \nexist with the prior organizational structure. These relationships have created an expectation of \ncooperation and a sense of mutual accountability for the work. The Monitor saw evidence of \nimproved communication between Resource Family Licensing and Resource Family Workers in \nmany, though not all, of the local DYFS offices visited. \n \nThe Impact Teams will continue to be deployed to the remaining Area Offices until the majority \nof Resource Family applications can be resolved in 150 days. \n \nThe Impact Teams also identified areas of training for both Licensing and Resource Family staff. \nThe Department responded to this finding by assigning high level staff to develop cross-training \ncurricula for the two units so that Licensing and Resource Family staff will better understand \ntheir corresponding roles. The training as currently constructed begins with training on New \nJersey’s new CPM and its role in work with Resource Families. Other components under \nconsideration for intensive training are: \n \n•  Customer Service – A Brief Overview of Applicants Rights \n•  Job Responsibilities of Office of Licensing \n•  Job Responsibilities of Resource Family Worker \n•  Office Structure – How local offices and Licensing are structured and the general \nflow of work of each office \n•  Foster Parent Role – What is a SAFE home evaluation? \n•  What is an Office of Licensing Home Inspection? \n•  One day field experience – Licensing workers spend a day with Resource Family \nworker and Resource Family worker spends a day in Licensing. \n \nThe Department continues to rely on the Impact Teams to raise systemic and structural problems \nto leadership’s attention. For example, during site visits, staff in several offices identified some \nstructural licensing standards as a barrier for licensing families and kin in urban areas. The \nDepartment is now reviewing these barriers to determine how modifications can be made. The \nMonitor looks forward to more closely examining the results of the Impact Team’s work in the \nnext monitoring period. \n \nThe MSA requires the State to facilitate the process for potential Resource Families so that they \ncan achieve licensure within 150 of their application (MSA, II.H.4). The Department is \nimplementing the process and timeframes as outlined in Figure 16. However, the Department \ncontinues to evaluate, review and improve the process, and considers it a work in progress.  \n \nAs evidence of its own self-evaluation, the State provided the Monitor with a breakdown of \napplications approved in January 2007, a month in which it received 311 applications. In \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 45 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nJanuary, a total of 48 percent of applications were licensed within the 150-day period, and \nanother 19 percent had issues resolved and were awaiting final licensing. The Monitor is \nsatisfied that, given the complexity of the licensing process, the State is making significant \nprogress towards its goal of a 150-day timeframe between application and licensure of Resource \nFamilies. \n \n2.  DCF created a tracking and target setting system for ensuring there is an accurate real \ntime list of current and available Resource Family Homes (MSA, Section II.H.9). \n \nIn the previous monitoring period, DCF worked hard to produce an accurate baseline of available \nResource Family Homes. The MSA requires the State to use this baseline information to create \nan accurate tracking system to determine in real time which Resource Family homes are \navailable to staff seeking placement for a child. (MSA, II. H.9). The State has chosen to include \nthis system as part of its New Jersey SPIRIT program, and has demonstrated to the Monitor its \nsignificant capabilities. When fully operational, a worker will have available online up-to-date \nand accurate information on the homes available as placement options: homes open, homes \nclosed, family members in the homes, ages, active services available to the home, whether it is \nopen to sibling groups, etc. The approval process for placements is clear and accessible. While \nthis process does not supplant the need for quality case conferencing, it is a valuable tool that \nwill greatly enhance the work of Resource Family staff, management, and leadership. \n \n3.  DCF further closed the gap by 25 percent between current Resource Family support \nrates and the USDA’s estimated cost of raising a child. \n \nThe MSA requires the State to close the gap between current Resource Family support rates \n(foster care, kinship care, and adoption subsidy) and the United States Department of \nAgriculture’s estimated cost of raising a child. (MSA, II. H.15). New rates sufficient to close the \ngap by 25 percent became effective January 1, 2007 (see Table 15). \n \nTable 15: \nDYFS Approved Resource Family Rates, Effective January 1, 2007 \nDifference  Percentage of \nDYFS  Revised USDA  Approved \nbetween USDA  increase  Approved  \nAge of  Rate  Rate CY 2005  Increase to \n2005 Rate and  required to  DYFS Rate \nChild  12/31/06     (published April  Monthly \nDYFS Rate  close gap 25%  1/1/07 \n(STEP 0)  2006)  Rate \n12/31/06  by 1/1/07 \n \n0-5  $497  $667  $170  33%  $56  $553 \n \n6-9  $534  $718  $184  33%  $61  $595 \n \n10-12  $557  $741  $184  33%  $61  $618 \n           \n13-17  $609  $786  $177  33%  $58  $667 \nSource: DCF, DYFS, January 1, 2007 \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS) \n \nDCF, through its Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS) is responsible for \nfinding appropriate community-based services and/or out-of-home placements for children and \nyouth in New Jersey who experience significant emotional and behavioral challenges. Some of \nthese youth are also involved with DYFS and the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). \nUnder the MSA, DCF, through DCBHS, is required to minimize the number of children in \nDYFS custody placed in out-of-state congregate care settings and work to bring these children \nplaced out-of-state back to New Jersey as soon as they are ready to be “stepped down.”  \n \nDCBHS has experienced several leadership changes in this monitoring period. An interim \ndirector has been appointed with the expectation of selecting and appointing a permanent \nDirector in the coming months. Despite the changes in Division leadership, the MSA \nrequirements related to DCBHS’ work have been achieved for this reporting period.  \n \n1.  DCF took concrete actions to minimize the number of out-of-state placements and \nreturn children placed out-of-state to New Jersey. \n \nDCF continues to place children out-of-state. The majority of these children have significant \nmental health problems and are placed out-of-state following attempts to find an appropriate \nplacement within the State. A few of the placements made out-of-state are in locations closer to \nthe child’s community than alternative in-state placements. As of June 2007, there were 306 \nchildren placed out-of-state.20 Table 16 depicts the number of new out-of-state placements made \nduring this reporting period. \n \n Table 16:  \nOut-of-State Authorizations \nJanuary – June 2007 \nNumber of authorizations for youth in \nMonth  DYFS custody \n(total number of authorizations) \nJanuary  8  (28 ) \nFebruary  8  (20) \nMarch  6  (12) \nApril  3  (7) \nMay  2  (9) \nJune  9  (15 ) \nTOTAL   36  (91) \n               Source: New Jersey Department of Children and Family Services, DCBHS \n                                                 \n20 New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Quarterly Update, September 5, 2007. The number of \nauthorized placements has subsequently decreased in July and August 2007 (290 children and 287 children \nrespectively). \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 47 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n \nFor the most part, the number of authorizations is significantly lower than the three months \ntracked in the last monitoring report.21 Much work, including the development of additional \nappropriate in-state resources, remains in order to significantly minimize out-of-state placements.  \n \nBased on the State’s analysis of the reasons youth were being placed out-of-state, DCF and \nDCBHS contracted with providers throughout New Jersey to add 86 “specialty beds.” These \nbeds will serve youth with complex behavioral and mental health issues. Several of the beds are \nspecifically for teenage girls. Currently, 34 beds are operational and filled, 22 beds will be \navailable by the end of October 2007, 15 are scheduled to be available in January 2008, and 15 \nare still under negotiation.  \n \nIn addition to employing strategies to prevent out-of-state placement, DCBHS in partnership \nwith DYFS has begun to examine each child placed out-of-state and implement an individualized \nplan for their return to New Jersey and their specific community. DCBHS and DYFS identified \n119 children under the custody of DYFS for case planning conferences. These conferences will \nbe held with DCF partners, including the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), and \nwill assess each child’s current progress, feasibility of returning to the State, and appropriate \nprograms and/or community services necessary to return the child to the State and/or step the \nchild down to a lower level of placement. These conferences began in September 2007 and will \ncontinue through the early November 2007. In the first week, of 14 children reviewed, 7 have \nbeen identified as ready to leave their out-of-state placement and return to placement in New \nJersey. \n \n2.  DCF is able to find placements within 30 days for almost all of DYFS youth who are in \njuvenile detention awaiting placement. \n \nAs described in the last monitoring report, DCF created a systematic process to identify and track \nyouth in juvenile detention facilities who remain in these facilities solely because they are \nawaiting appropriate placement. Under the MSA, no youth in DYFS custody should wait longer \nthan 30 days for placement (Section II.D.5). According to DCF, 18 youth in DYFS custody and \nin detention were awaiting placement from December 2006 to July 2007. Of these 18 youth \nawaiting placement post-disposition, 10 were male, 8 female.  \n \nTable 17 on the following page provides information on the length of time each of these youth \nwaited for placement. All but two youth were placed within the 30-day time period.  \n \n                                                 \n21 In the last monitoring report the number of authorizations for out-of-state placements were as follows: 24 children \nin October 2006, 54 children in November 2006, and 39 children in December 2006. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 48 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nTable 17:  \nYouth under DYFS custody in juvenile \ndetention post-disposition awaiting placement \n   \nLength of waiting time  Number of Youth \n \n   \n    0-15 days       3 \n   \n    16-30 days      13 \n   \n    Over 30 days       2 \n \nSource: DCF, August 1, 2007 placement report \n \nThe two youth who were not placed in 30 days were both female—one waited 33 days, the other \n37 days. Both of these teenage girls were characterized as assaultive, with severe emotional \nproblems. DCBHS made significant efforts to find in-state placements, but after multiple \nrejections the girls were both placed out-of-state. \n \n3.  DCF continues to find avenues to support new services for children and their families \nthat are “evidence-based practices.” \n \nUnder the MSA, the State was required to seek approval from the federal government for a \nMedicaid rate structure “to support the use of new services for children and families, including \ncommunity-based and evidence-based informed, or support practices, such as Functional Family \nTherapy and Multi-Systemic Therapy” (Section II.C.2). \n \nThe State examined different avenues for funding this evidence-based practice. Based on the \nanalysis, DCF decided that these services could best be supported by the Intensive In-\nCommunity service line within the existing New Jersey Medicaid State Plan. Approval was \nsought from the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) and DMAHS \ndetermined this expenditure was appropriate and that approval from the federal government was \nnot required. Thus, the MSA requirement is not helpful or necessary to the State in \naccomplishing the ultimate requirement of supporting these new services for children and \nfamilies. \n \nThe State intends to issue an RFP for Evidence-Based Services by December 2007. The RFP will \nidentify targeted populations and a menu of evidence-based practices approved by DCBHS. The \ngoal is to select four evidence-based practice sites in FY 2008 and then expand services based on \nlessons learned.  \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 49 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n4.  DCF has amended its policies to prevent the inappropriate use of shelters for children \ncoming into out-of-home care. \n \nThe MSA requires the State to eliminate the inappropriate use of shelters as an option for youth \nwho need to be placed out of their homes. The only appropriate use of shelters will be: “(i) as an \nalternative to detention, or (ii) a short-term placement of an adolescent in crisis which shall not \nextend beyond 45 days; or (iii) a basic center for homeless youth.” (Section II.D.8) Further, \nbeginning in July 2007, shelters shall not be used as a placement option for children under the \nage of 13 (MSA, II.D.7). DCF developed the policy to support these new placement restrictions. \n \nC.  Services and Supports for Youth \n \nUnfortunately, in jurisdictions throughout the country, the specific needs of adolescents in foster \ncare are too often neglected. Over the last several years, child welfare agencies and foundations \nhave brought heightened attention to adolescents’ need for permanency and well-being, \nespecially for youth growing up in and transitioning out of the foster care system. This report has \nhighlighted some of New Jersey’s permanency activities for older youth in Section IV.B. \nAdditional activities DCF has taken to support youth are described below. \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the State was required to report on changes to its policies and \npractices for youth aged 18 to 21 and for youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, \ntransgender, questioning or intersex (GLBTQI). DCF spent much of this year assessing its data \nabout youth in care, understanding where they are placed, and the current state of practice \nsupporting them. The State has taken some preliminary steps to focus on the specific needs of \nthis population, and the Monitor hopes that in the upcoming months, additional progress will be \nmade in providing for the permanence and well being of adolescents. \n \nDCF is focusing on expanding the number of youth aged 18 to 21 who receive services if they \nhave not achieved permanency by age 18, and the range of supports available and provided to \nolder youth. As of June 2007, DCF reported the following: \n \n•  1250 youth ages 18-21 were receiving in home services; \n•  471 youth ages 18-21 were receiving out-of-home services; \n•  323 youth were enrolled in Chaffee Medicaid; and \n•  418 youth received tuition assistance, room, board and books through the New Jersey \nScholars program (an 86% increase over the previous year at a cost of $2.5 million). \n \n1.  DCF significantly revised existing policies in order to continue to provide supportive \nservices to youth aged 18 to 21. \n \nUpon reviewing the policies regarding the provision of support to older youth, DCF leadership \ndiscovered that there was an operating presumption in policy and practice of closing the DYFS \ncase when youth turned 18. The information system presumptively closed a youth’s case on \nhis/her 18th birthday unless there was a proactive request by the worker and youth to keep the \ncase open. DCF worked with the Office of Information services to amend the SIS computer \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 50 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nsystem to correct the presumption of case closure. Further, DCF changed its written policies to \ncreate a presumption in favor of keeping the youth’s case open. Now, according to DYFS policy, \na youth’s case is closed only upon written request of the youth or no later than his/her 21st \nbirthday. Further, Resource Homes will continue to receive a daily board rate for youth aged 18 \nto 21 who have left their homes, but return for college breaks or unexpected or prolonged illness. \nDCF will need to continue to work with case workers and Judges to help them understand this \nchange in policy and practice. These actions by DCF meet the MSA requirement (Section \nII.C.5). The Monitor will continue to investigate the State’s efforts to implement these policy \nchanges. \n \n2.  DCF added 112 transitional living beds. \n \nIn April 2007, DCF far exceeded the MSA June 2008 requirement to establish 18 beds available \nto youth transitioning out of the foster care system. (Section II.C. 11). DCF established 112 \ntransitional living beds, and dedicated a handful of these beds to youth who identify as gay, \nlesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersexual (GLBTI).22 According to DCF, “the investment by \nDCF of $2.7 million to support these transitional housing services will be leveraged to gain \nadditional federal and state dollars, primarily in capital acquisition and rehabilitation funds, \nthrough New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs, who partnered with DCF on the \nrequest for proposal (RFP) process.”23 \n \n3.  DCF created a preliminary GLBTQI Plan. \n \nDCF’s GLBTQI Plan represents its “first statement of how it intends to meet the needs of this \nmost vulnerable population.”24 According to DCF, the plan was designed with consultation from \nthree different workgroups looking at issues faced by GLBTQI youth. This plan is to be part of \nthe general enhancement of services to adolescents and is an initial document that will grow as \nthe CPM is implemented. Most of the plan will be implemented by June 2008 (meeting the MSA \nrequirement Section II.C.4). \n \nHighlights of the GLBTQI Plan include: \n•  Examining screening procedures for youth and reviewing in-service training;  \n•  Providing additional training in “adolescent development, including adolescent \nsexual development, integrating the issues associated with GLBTQI youth”25; \n•  Recruiting appropriate Resource Families, counseling and health services that can \nbe sensitive to needs of GLBTQI youth; and \n•  Analyzing policies and practices to assess the impact on GLBTQI youth. \n                                                 \n22 These are 4 beds at Anchor House according to the New Jersey Department of Children and Families Plan for \nService Delivery for Youth who Identify as Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, or Intersexual, State \nFiscal Year 2007.

DCF directed significant resources to new programs to support adolescents. \n \nAs stated previously, DCF has committed many new dollars to supporting services specifically to \naddress the needs of adolescents under their care and supervision.

MEETING THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF \nCHILDREN \n \nA.  Building a new system for the provision of health care to children in out-of-home \nplacements \n \nRedesigning the delivery of quality health care services to children and youth in out-of-home \nplacement is a key obligation under the MSA (Section II.F.8). Like other MSA reform efforts, \nthe improvement of health care service delivery requires a thoughtful and staged process. \nNumerous studies in the past several years, including two reports by the Office of the Child \nAdvocate have highlighted the need for reform of the health care delivery system for children in \nout-of-home placement. As reported in the first monitoring report, the State fulfilled its \nrequirement to gather and analyze health care data regarding the frequency of pre-placement \nassessments, Comprehensive Health Evaluations for Children (CHECs), and the provision of \ndental care. Based on this information, the State was required to establish baselines and targets \nfor the delivery of health care services to children in out-of-home placement and to develop a \ncomprehensive health care plan for these children and youth. Over the next year, DCF will be \naggressively implementing this new plan and modifying it as necessary to ensure quality health \ncare services are appropriately developed and delivered to all children and youth in an accessible \nand timely manner. Both DCF and the Monitor will be evaluating the effectiveness of this new \nmodel.  \n \nDCF undertook a deliberative process to build a new comprehensive health care model. DCF \ncontacted many external partners to obtain feedback and information—including the Regional \nDiagnostic and Treatment Centers (RDTC), existing Comprehensive Health Evaluation for \nChildren (CHEC) providers, the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), and the Monitor. The Plan \nthat emerged is both comprehensive and ambitious.  \n \nAs the result of deliberate work over several months to analyze data, track progress, and develop \ncreative solutions, nearly all children entering out-of-home care received pre-placement \nassessments, with the majority receiving these assessments in a non-emergency room setting. \nDCF met the MSA requirement (Section II.F.7) in July 2007 by having 90 percent of these \nexams occur in a setting other than an emergency room. Additionally, DCF reached agreement \nwith the Monitor on health care targets to be measured over the next several years. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 53 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \n \n1.  DCF designed a comprehensive, coordinated health care plan for children in out-of \nhome placement. \n \nOn May 22, 2007, DCF released their vision for providing comprehensive coordinated health \ncare to children and youth who are placed out of their homes.26 Specifically, this plan outlines a \nhealth care model which “emphasizes: \n•  Care should be provided in a manner sensitive to the child. \n•  Continuity of care is critical and will be managed by child health units providing \nhealth care case coordination in each of the DYFS local offices. \n•  Children’s access to care requires expansion of existing providers statewide and \nflexibility in the service delivery model which will be addressed through \ncontracting via a public Request for Qualifications Process (RFQ) in June 2007. \n•  Health care planning must be integrated into permanency planning for children in \nout-of-home care. \n•  Success requires real partnership between state agencies, with and among \nproviders, and with the child and family team.”27 \n \nNoteworthy changes provided for in the new “coordinated” health care plan include: \n•  Modification of the manner in which comprehensive medical examinations can be \ndelivered; \n•  Building of children’s medical health units and significantly expanding the \nnumber of nurses in local DYFS offices; \n•  Redefining the referral protocols to Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Centers \n(RDTC); and  \n•  Refining the definition of pre-placement assessments. \n \n  a.  Rethinking Comprehensive Medical Examinations  \n \nUnder the MSA, the State is required to provide all children entering out-of-home care \nwith comprehensive medical care. Services the State has committed to providing include \npre-placement assessments, a comprehensive medical examination within the first 60 \ndays of placement, yearly medical exams in accordance with the Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) guidelines, semi-annual dental exams, \nmental health assessments for children with suspected mental health needs, and any \nfollow-up care needed by a child (MSA, II.F.2). Previously the State relied on the \nComprehensive Health Evaluation for Children (CHEC) model as the intended vehicle to \ncomprehensively assess the health care needs of all children and youth entering out-of-\nhome placement. CHEC examinations require a three part examination—medical, neuro-\ndevelopmental, and mental health assessments—and in most instances took place on a \nsingle day for four to six hours. These services, which were to be completed within the \n                                                 \n26 New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Coordinated Health Care Plan for Children in Out-of-Home \nPlacement, May 22, 2007. http://www.nj.gov/dcf/DCFHealthCarePlan_5.22.07.pdf  \n27 Ibid, Executive Summary, p.2. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 54 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nfirst 60 days of placement, were provided once a year primarily by a limited number of \nmedical facilities who contracted with DCF.  \n \nAfter careful analysis, DCF determined there were many challenges to the CHEC \napproach. Many regions of the State had no facilities available to provide CHEC \nexaminations and as a result children were either exempt from this examination or \ntraveled a great distance to be seen by a CHEC provider. Further, case workers \nexperienced great frustration because these exams were difficult to schedule due to the \nlimited number of CHEC examination slots available and CHEC providers were \nfrustrated by the high rates of cancellations or “no shows” of children. Because the \nexisting structure prevented efficient coordination of CHEC schedules, children \nexperienced long waits to be seen by CHEC providers and CHEC providers were not \nproviding services at their full capacity. A final concern was that the CHEC model was \ndeveloped with essentially no provisions for follow-up care or for linking children and \ntheir families with a “medical home.”  \n \nA CHEC audit in 2005, lead by the Office of the Child Advocate, similarly found that \nCHEC examinations were not occurring on a timely basis, children were attending CHEC \nappointments with individuals that had little or no knowledge of their health history or \ncurrent needs, and follow-up care was insufficient.28 On October 3, 2007, the current \nChild Advocate released another CHEC audit that re-examined this service and found \nsimilar challenges.29 Specifically, the report found that the CHEC program provided an \ninvaluable service, but only to a select number of children. Less than one-third of \nchildren entering care received a CHEC evaluation, and those that received these \nevaluations did not receive them within the 30 day recommended time period. Few \nchildren received the identified follow-up care and vital medical information was not \nalways shared with caregivers and other medical providers.30 \n \nObviously, thoughtful health care reform is necessary and crucial for children entering \nout-of-home care. In developing its reform plan, DCF set to accomplish two goals; to \nensure: 1) that more children in the State of New Jersey who are placed out of their \nhomes receive timely comprehensive medical examinations upon coming into out-of-\nhome care and 2) that providers of these exams have the ability to serve as an ongoing \nmedical home for the children they see. This model is promoted by the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics. The comprehensive medical examinations the State has proposed \nfor implementation differ from the current CHEC model. These health examinations \nrequire a comprehensive physical examination as well as an initial mental health \nscreening. Should a child be found to have a mental health need, a full mental health \nevaluation will then be conducted.   \n \n                                                 \n28 Office of the Child Advocate, Needs and Assets Assessment of the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for \nChildren (CHEC) Program, December 19, 2005. \n29Office of the Child Advocate, Health Matters: A Study of the Comprehensive Health Evaluation for Children \n(CHEC) Program, October 3, 2007. \n30 Ibid. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 55 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nDCF leadership met with some federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and other \nqualified providers in areas of New Jersey where children were not receiving CHEC \nexams due to a lack of a CHEC provider to determine their interest and availability to \nbecome “medical homes” for children in out-of-home placement and what, if any, \nimpediments they might face in meeting the comprehensive medical examination \nrequirements. Based on these conversations, it was determined that some FQHCs and \nother providers had the capacity to serve these children, but that the comprehensive \nmedical exam may require them to partner with additional providers for particular parts \nof the exam (such as mental health assessments). Thus, the Request for Proposal that \nDCF published in June 2007 provided for this flexibility. A bidders’ conference was held \non July 25, 2007 and additional questions emailed to DCF were answered publicly on the \nDCF website. DCF is now reviewing provider responses to the health care RFP. When \nnew contracts are in place, all children in DYFS custody in New Jersey will receive a \ncomprehensive medical examination from a FQHC, CHEC, or other qualified medical \nprovider. \n \nUnder the MSA requirement, DCF is required to provide comprehensive medical exams \nwithin the first 60 days of a child entering out-of-home placement. DCF is working with \nstaff and providers to meet the more rigorous American Academy of Pediatrics standard \nof comprehensive exams being conducted within 30 days of placement. The Monitor \nsupports this goal, but in keeping with the MSA requirement, will measure the \ncompletion of comprehensive medical exams within 60 days of placement. Over the next \nfew months, the Monitor will be working with DCF and other partners in the State to \ndesign an effective means of measuring the timeliness and quality of health care services \nprovided to children in out-of-home placement. \n \nb.   Building Child Health Units \n \nAfter examining different States’ models of coordinating health care service delivery for \nchildren in foster care, DCF leadership decided that the responsibility for coordinating \nthe health care of children in out-of-home placement must lie with DCF. Therefore, each \nlocal DYFS office will have a Child Health Unit (CHU) consisting of at least a nurse and \na scheduler. Eventually, each office will have one nurse for every 50 children in out-of-\nhome placement, with appropriate administrative supports. These units will be \nresponsible for medical case management—compiling medical records and \ndocumentation and providing key information and documentation to appropriate service \nproviders. Schedulers will be responsible for coordinating all comprehensive medical \nexam appointments for the local office and assuring the maximum use of these health \ncare facilities by filling cancellations with other eligible children. Nurses will provide \nmedical consultation to workers and pre-placement assessments as necessary.31 \n \n                                                 \n31 A flow chart delineating the responsibilities of the Child Health Unit is included in DCF’s Coordinated Health \nPlan.

With a Memorandum of Understanding beginning \nJuly 1, 2007, DCF is working with FXB on a phased roll-out of the CHU throughout \nfiscal year 2008. The first phase begins December 2007 in Sussex, Hunterdon, Bergen, \nand Passaic counties (there will be one unit in each area except for Bergen which will \nbegin with two CHUs). DCF intends to evaluate the roll-out with FXB on a regular basis \nto adjust the roles and responsibilities of the CHU. \n \nTable 20 below identifies the care coordination functions of the proposed CHUs.  \n \nTable 20:  \nHealth Care Coordination Functions of Child Health Unit \n \n \n•  Performing Pre-placement assessments \n•  Initial full health examinations scheduled \n•  Children received CHEC or initial full health examination \n•  Children received annual EPSDT examination \n•  Children ages 3 and older receive semi-annual dental exams \n•  Children receive appropriate follow-up care \n•  Creation of Health Care Plan for children in out-of-home placement \n•  Participation in Case Review conferences \n•  Participation in Family Team Meetings (or equivalent) \n•  Participation in the Case plan implementation in the pilot local offices \nand ongoing as new local offices come on-line \n \nSource: DCF, The Child Health Program, Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center, University of \nMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Fiscal Year 2008. \n \nLocal office workers are enthusiastic about the creation of Child Health Units and the \nexpanded services of nurses and schedulers. Site visits revealed that space will be a \nconstraint in the planned roll-out but the pressure to make these units available and \noperational in every office as soon as possible is significant. Integrating this \ncomprehensive health model into the developing CPM will be another challenge which \nthe Monitor will continue to follow over the next several months. Several of the targets \nDCF will be tracking will also be incorporated into monitoring of the CPM and of the \ndelivery of quality health care to children in out-of-home placement. Over the next \nseveral months, as the CHUs are established, DCF must balance a rapid roll-out plan with \nensuring quality medical care for children in their custody.  \n \n   \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Clarifying the use of Regional Diagnostic Treatment Centers (RDTCs) \n \nCurrently, DCF works with four Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (RDTCs) \nand one satellite office to assist in the evaluation of severe cases of child abuse and \nneglect. This is a specialized service that requires highly trained physicians (who are a \nlimited resource in New Jersey). DCF spent several months meeting with the staff at the \nRDTCs to discuss their current capacity to meet the needs of children who have \nexperienced severe abuse and neglect. According to DCF, many children who require this \nservice are not able to be seen by RDTCs. DCF believes that the reason for this gap in \nservice is due to inappropriate referrals of children to RDTCs and, similar to the CHEC \nexams, high cancellation and “no show” rate for appointments. As a result of these \ndiscussions, DCF and the RDTCs agreed that new protocols were necessary to prioritize \nand target their services to youth most in need of their services. On May 3, 2007,DCF \nissued new referral protocols to address these concerns. DCF will assess the effectiveness \nof the dual strategies of clarifying the protocol for referrals to RDTCs and using \nschedulers at the local office Child Health Units to coordinate filling spots for cancelled \nappointments and reducing no show rates. The combination of these strategies will be \nassessed to determine if the RDTCs as currently resourced are capable of fully meeting \nthe needs of children requiring this service, or if the capacity of RDTCs will ultimately \nneed to increase. \n \nd.   Refining the definition of pre-placement assessments \n \nOver the last year, DCF has worked with local offices to assess their ability to provide \npre-placement assessments in a non-emergency room setting for all children entering out-\nof-home care. Under the MSA, all children entering out of home care are required to have \nthis assessment and beginning in June 2007, 90 percent of children entering out-of-home \nplacements must have pre-placement assessments in a setting that is not an emergency \nroom (Section II.F.7). DCF is to be commended for achieving nearly 100 percent of pre-\nplacement exams, with 92 percent of all children in out-of-home care in July 2007 \nreceiving their pre-placement health assessments in a non-emergency room setting (see \nTable 21).  \n \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Additionally, nurses in local offices had their job \nresponsibilities reorganized to prioritize providing pre-placement assessments. Some \nlocal offices staggered the hours nurses worked so that pre-placement assessments could \nbe provided outside of traditional office hours. Further, DYFS caseworkers were \nencouraged by leadership to prioritize pre-placement assessments when they recognized \nthe need to remove a child. Workers were urged to contact a child’s current primary care \nprovider to determine if a pre-placement assessment could be conducted; if that was not \npossible, the local office nurse, or medical provider partner were to be contacted for an \nappointment. 32 Finally, DYFS still requires a pre-placement assessment to be conducted \nbefore a child is placed out of his/her home, but has added the caveat that under \nexceptional circumstances a child may receive a pre-placement assessment within 24 \nhours of placement if it is determined that it is in the child’s best interest (For example, a \nchild is removed late at night and has no noticeable and immediate health concerns. The \nworker would be responsible for ensuring that child be seen the next day, rather than take \nthe child to an emergency room and wait that night.)33 \n \n                                                 \n32 See New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Coordinated Health Care Plan for Children in Out-of-\nHome Placement, p. 8. for pre-placement assessment flow chart. \n33 Exceptional circumstances are detailed in the policy guidelines. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v. Corzine     Page 59 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nAs a result of these strategies, DCF reports that it was able to decrease the use of \nemergency rooms, particularly during evening hours. DCF increased the percentage of \npre-placement assessments completed during the day and reduced the number completed \nin the evenings. Pre-placement assessment data will continue to be monitored moving \nforward, especially in light of the proposed coordinated health care delivery system.  \n \ne.   Creating a Medical Passport for all children in out-of-home placement \n \nUnder the MSA, all children entering out-of-home placement are to have a Medical \nPassport created for them. This passport will gather all relevant medical information in a \nsingle place and be made available to parents, children (if old enough), and any other \ncaregivers. The CHU nurses will be responsible for ensuring that the passports are \ncreated, given to children, families, and providers, and updated regularly. The \ninformation for the passport will be entered into New Jersey SPIRIT by the nurses, and \nthen exported to a “passport” form. Items included in the passport are: medication of \nchild, immunizations, hospitalizations, chronic health issues, practitioners and contact \ninformation, key mental health and developmental milestones, last EPSDT, dental \ninformation, and any special transportation needs. These passports will be tested in \nHunterdon and Sussex counties first, adjusted as needed, and then rolled out to other \nCHUs.  \n \nDCF decided to launch this Passport Plan now rather than wait for the Medicaid project, \neMedic, to be finalized. The Medicaid project will pull together all existing medical \ninformation from electronic records from Medicaid and Health databases.34 When \nMedicaid has created eMedic, DCF will revisit the current Medical passports for \ncompatibility and/or merger with the Medicaid documents. \n  \n2.  DCF set health care baseline and targets to be measured over the next several years. \n \nThe DCF Child Health Unit staff conducted two studies of DYFS and Medicaid data to assess \ncurrent status of health care delivery and inform the setting of health care baselines and targets. \nThe studies were of a small, but significant sample size. Based on this information and after \ndiscussion with the Monitor, the following health care baselines and targets were agreed upon in \nAugust and September 2007 (MSA, II.F.5-6). \n \n                                                 \n34 Medicaid is in the process of developing this integrated medical information database. DCF is involved in the \nplanning and will use that database to populate the Medical Passport system once it becomes available. (Target date \nis Fall 2008).  \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.

Corzine     Page 61 \nMonitoring Report for January 1 – June 30, 2007 \n \n\nEmbargoed – Not for Release until October 22, 2007 \nThe Monitor has proposed that DCF add two additional health care targets: \n•  Children are current with immunizations; and \n•  Children’s caregivers receive up-to-date health passport upon placement or following \ncompletion of the 72-hour Family Team Meeting. \n \nDCF and the Monitor have agreed to review these indicators by December 2007, determine how \nand when data can be collected to measure them and make a decision about their inclusion in the \nhealth care targets to be monitored. \n \n3.  DCF is pursuing other health-related strategies \n \nPsychiatrist \nMany children and youth who come into contact with DCF have significant behavioral and \nmental health challenges. DCF recognized the need to have the help of a child/adolescent \npsychiatrist as they implement the new health care plan, begin reforming the children’s \nbehavioral health system, and develop prevention services for children and families. Further, \nDCF staff require clinical consultation on the use of psychotropic medications and understanding \npsychiatric diagnoses of children in their care. Thus, DCF has entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding to obtain the assistance of a qualified psychiatrist to help meet these needs. While \nnot required by the Modified Settlement Agreement, using the expertise of a psychiatrist at a \nsenior leadership level should help DCF with its reform efforts. \n \nDental Care Provider Capacity \nNew Jersey still faces significant challenges in building capacity for dental care for children in \nits custody. The lack of dentists willing to accept Medicaid patients is one of the resounding \nthemes identified by the seven sites visited by the Monitor in the spring 2007. Workers described \nspending significant time transporting children across the State in order to receive dental care. In \nupcoming months, DCF leadership will meet with dentists across the State to discuss the gap of \nservices and will work with the Child Health Units to identify additional providers. Adequate \nand timely dental care is an area that requires new state partnerships with the dental community. \nThe State must also consider raising Medicaid reimbursement rates so that more dentists are \nwilling to see children and youth involved with DYFS. \n \n \nCharlie and Nadine H. et al. v.
