    "summary": "<p>On November 1, 2001, plaintiffs, current and former inmates of the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, challenging the defendants' procedures and policies for testing and treating the Hepatitic C Virus (HCV) in the Oregon inmate population. The plaintiffs brought a number of federal and state law claims, including a claim that the ODOC's HCV treatment policies violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as well as a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (Americans with Disabilities Act) alleging that the HCV policies improperly denied benefits by reason of disability. The plaintiffs also alleged that the ODOC officials used de facto policies to delay and deny treating inmates for HCV. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and injunctive relief, including an order that defendants create a new panel of experts to evaluate HCV treatment policies and make recommendations to ensure policies are in accord with the standard of care in the community as a whole. </p><p>On December 19, 2002, the court certified a mandatory class under rule 23(b)(2) consisting of \"all inmates who are infected with the HCV virus and who are in the custody and control of the Oregon Department of Corrections.\" Additionally, the court certified a subclass consisting of \"all inmates who were incarcerated under the control and custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections and who were infected with the HCV virus during the time of their incarceration.\" The court explained that this subclass of formerly incarcerated individuals could seek only declaratory relief in this action.</p><p>On April 7, 2004, the parties filed a stipulated motion to stay proceedings pursuant to a settlement and release filed with the court that same day. The settlement provided for immediate dismissal of the individual claims of individually named plaintiffs and individual class members without prejudice as to all defendants. Once the final chart review concluded and appropriate orders were entered, the plaintiff class would dismiss all claims against defendants with prejudice, except that individual class members would not be barred from filing subsequent individual actions in their own name. The settlement also provided for immediate dismissal of all individual defendants without prejudice to individual class members only, but with prejudice to plaintiff class claims and class issues. The defendants also agreed to pay $175,000 to the plaintiffs class attorney within 15 days of settlement, along with some additional fees for work during the pendency of the case.</p><p>The settlement provided for the creation of a Medical Review Panel (MRP), that would review the written 2003 HCV treatment guidelines and healthcare delivery system within the ODOC (\"Guidelines\"). The three doctors on the panel were specified by the parties and would be paid by the defendants for their work. The MRP would also complete a two part review of the treatment of HCV infected prisoners within the ODOC, looking first at the Guidelines and then at 100 randomly selected medical charts. It also provided for the appointment of Judge Donald Ashmanskas as Special Master for oversight of administration of the agreement by the court. </p><p>The MRP would first examine the Guidelines and determine whether they reflected a reasonable community standard of care appropriate for the treatment of Hepatitis C. If the MRP determined that modifications, revisions, or amendments to the Guidelines are recommended, the MRP would identify the reasons supporting those recommendations and suggest specific changes to the policy and healthcare delivery system. Upon completion of its review, the MRP would issue a written draft report to the parties within 60 days, or no later than June 7, 2004. From there, the parties would have 30 days to submit brief written comments to the MRP. The MRP would then issue its final report within 30 days of receipt of the parties' written comments to the draft report. </p><p>After submitting its final report on the Guidelines review, the MRP would commence an 18 month chart review of up to 100 medical charts of class members. The MRP would review the selected charts to assess compliance of the treatment utilized for the specific patient with the existing Guidelines and the medical standard of care. The MRP would then follow a similar process for reporting, with a draft issued to parties first before a final report to the special master. </p><p>Any disputes concerning the enactment of the recommendations made by the MRP would be brought to the special master, who would make a determination on the dispute and issue findings. The only significant dispute was decided on November 14, 2005, when the special master found that it was permissible for the Hep-C treatment guidelines to require certain inmates to participate in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for at least one month to receive treatment. </p><p>On July 14, 2006, the special master accepted and adopted the final MRP Report, which found that the Oregon ODOC 2003 guidelines met the community standard of care with respect to evaluation and treatment, but also found that the guidelines were deficient in some respects. Specifically, the report found that the guidelines did not comply with the community standard of care with respect to implementation and timing of Hepatitis C screening and treatment. The court then granted the parties joint motion to implement new guidelines that incorporated the MRP's recommendations, and to extend the review period to allow for the MRP to conduct the chart review phase of the settlement. </p><p>On April 6, 2007, the MRP final report for the chart review phase was submitted to the special master. The report, based on the review of 23 individual's medical charts conducted in January 2007, found that 20 of 23 cases of Hepatitis C care were generally consistent with the guidelines. The report also noted that the MRP revised guidelines had been distributed and that there was more attention being given to timeliness of evaluation and treatment. The report noted some suggested improvements, but did not make any finding that the treatment fell below the community standard of care. </p><p>On August 31, 2007, the court issued a stipulated judgment of dismissal, dismissing the case with prejudice pursuant to the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On November 1, 2001, current and former inmates of the Oregon Department of Corrections filed a class action complaint challenging the State's procedures and policies for testing and treating the Hepatitis C Virus in the Oregon inmate population. In 2002, the court certified a mandatory class under Rule 23(b)(2) consisting of \"all inmates who are infected with the HCV virus and who are in the custody and control of the Oregon Department of Corrections.\" The court certified a subclass consisting of \"all inmates who were incarcerated under the control and custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections and who were infected with the HCV virus during the time of their incarceration.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 7, 2004, the parties filed a settlement and release with the court. The settlement provided for the creation of a Medical Review Panel (MRP) that would examine both the guidelines in place for treatment of Hepatitis C, as well as a number of individual medical charts of inmates at ODOC who had been diagnosed with the disease. The MRP was to issue a final report on both the guidelines, and the state of the actual treatment as displayed by the medical charts, and make any recommendations necessary to bring the medical care in line with the community standard of care. In the first final report, the MRP found that the guidelines were largely compliant with regard to treatment and care, but deficient with respect to implementation and timing of screening, and the defendants made the recommended changes to remedy that. The settlement did not preclude individuals who had infected with Hepatitis C from bringing individual actions for damages in the future. On August 21, 2007, after the MRP had issued its final report on the individual chart review phase of its analysis, the court granted a stipulated judgment of dismissal pursuant to the terms of the settlement.

According to the tenns of the Settlement Agreement, a \npanel of outside expert physicians reviewed the ODOC Treatment Guidelines for \nthe medical treatment of hepatitis C infected prisoners and how those guidelines are \napplied when ODOC provides medical care to the individual prisoners.  Their \nrecommendations have been adopted and implemented by ODOC. \nNote:  ALL Class members are part of the settlement and are therefore prohibited \nfrom filing an individuallaw~suit about either the ODoe Hepatitis C Treatment \nGuidelines or the application of those Guidelines.

      "text": "Case 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 198    Filed 04/06/07    Page 1 of 2\nREPORT FROM THE HEPATITIS C MEDICAL REVIEW PANEL \nMarch 21, 2007 \nThe panel was sent copies of23 charts in mid January 2007 by Oregon DOC.  Each member of the Panel \nreviewed each case independently and met twice (March 8 and 14, 2007).  Each case was discussed and a \nconsensus arrived at.  A summary table for all cases is provided below.  A consensus was arrived at \nregarding overall impressions.  Recommendations are made with what the panel believes are reasonable \ncommunity practices in mind. \nOverall the panel found 20 of the 23 cases to show Hepatitis C care generally consistent with the guidelines \nwith a number of suggestions made.  The Panel did not review care prior to 2006 for timeliness issues since \nthis issue was addressed in the prior review.  Our anecdotal impressions of present cases that were in DOC \nprior to 2006 however confirmed our previous review impressions. \nIt appears that since the MRP revised guidelines have been distributed that there is more attention to \ntimeliness of evaluation and treatment. There is some very good care of Hepatitis C occurring in DOC. \nWhile timeliness and overall care appear to have improved there are some areas DOC needs to focus on. \nImproving care is a constant process and these improvements should be seen as the next step in a continual \nprocess. The panel suggests: \n•  Documentation overall is fair to poor.  Despite the importance and prevalence of Hepatitis C there \nis not a single source of documentation in the medical record regarding Hep C care that includes \npresent status, past status, and decision making.  Correct decisions appear to be made but it is \ndifficult to be certain that decisions were made for the correct reason.  The current Hepatitis C \ninformation sheet needs to be improved to provide this type of information.  The TLC summaries \nprovide no information about the reason for decisions being made. The community practice for \ndocumentation is highly variable and it is likely that many community practices have similar \nissues with documentation. These patients however are the most risky DOC patients in many \nrespects and their documentation should be a priority, \n•  There is a lack of documented hepatology consultation especially in complex cases.  In some of \nthese cases consultation may have resulted in no treatment or anticipation of complications. There \nappears to be less consultation in DOC with hepatologists than there is in the community. \nExamples of cases needing hepatology consultation include: \no  Early cirrhosis \no  Simultaneous Hepatitis B \no  Treatment strategies especially in patients needing growth factors \no  Patients with seizure disorders \n•  Throughout the care of patients and medical record documentation, DOC needs to emphasize the \nimportance of decision making.  The disease takes many years to evolve. Diagnostic and treatment \napproaches are changing.  It is very important that future clinical decision makers and patients \nunderstand why a decision was made. \nThree problem cases were identified.  2 cases (L,W) were complex cases.  These patients should have had \nhepatology consultation. Case 0 had no apparent plan or documentation related to Hep C issues. \nThe panel is happy to meet to further discuss in general or specific cases. \nREVIEW TABLE \nCase =  Letter assigned by DOC to a chart \nSummary = Panel overall impression.  OK means that the overall care and decision making was acceptable. \nSuggestions however are made in several of these cases \n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 198    Filed 04/06/07    Page 2 of 2\nComments = most important factors in a case \nSuggestions = More detail regarding how care could be improved in a case or other issues of note \nCase  Summary  Comments  Suggestions \nA  OK  Genotype 3  Does not need biopsy given he is a 3. \nB  OK  Better documentation needed \nc  OK  Treated  Not clear why 2 year interval until treatment.

WILLIAMSON\nSenior Assistant Attorney General\nLYNNE D. RENNICK\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General\nDepartment of Justice\n1162 Court Street N.E.\nSalem, OR  97301\nAttorneys for Defendants\n      1 - OPINION AND ORDER OF THE SPECIAL MASTER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 180    Filed 01/20/06    Page 2 of 6    Page ID#: 422\nASHMANSKAS, Magistrate Judge.\nOn April 4, 2004, a Settlement and Release Agreement (Doc.\n#142) (\"Settlement\") was entered in this action.  Pursuant to the\nSettlement, a three-member Medical Review Panel (\"MRP\") was formed\nby the Special Master, the Honorable Donald C. Ashmanskas.  The\nMRP  was charged with evaluating the Oregon Department of\nCorrections (\"ODOC\") 2003 Hepatitis C Treatment Guidelines (\"2003\nGuidelines\") to \"determine whether the [2003] Guidelines reflect\na  reasonable community standard of care appropriate for the\ntreatment of Hepatitis C.\"   In the process of performing this\nevaluation,  the MRP elected to update and re-draft the 2003\nGuidelines, which culminated in the filing with this court of a\ndocument entitled \"Medical Guidelines For Hepatitis C Evaluation\nand  Treatment - 2004,\"  (referred to hereafter as \"2004\nGuidelines\").\nTwo issues have arisen in connection with the Settlement\nAgreement and the proposed 2004 Guidelines.  First, Plaintiffs\nobject  to inclusion in the 2004 Guidelines of the following\nlanguage:\nUncorrected risk factors as contraindications:  Drug or\nAlcohol use/abuse (self report, positive drug screen,\npossession,  rule violation) or a new tattoo (DOC\nspecific)  within the prior 6 months is a\ncontraindication to medication treatment for Hepatitis\nC.   If there is any medical or criminal history of\nsubstance  abuse within 2 years, the inmate must be\npresently active in drug/alcohol recovery (including AA\n      2 - OPINION AND ORDER OF THE SPECIAL MASTER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 180    Filed 01/20/06    Page 3 of 6    Page ID#: 423\nor NA) for at least 1 month.  Drug or alcohol relapse is\nan absolute indication for termination of treatment.\n(Emphasis  added.)  Second, Plaintiffs object to Defendants'\nrequest for a report from the MRP indicating whether the 2003\nGuidelines failed to meet community medical standards.  \nUpon review of notes from the numerous conferences leading up\nto and following the Settlement Agreement, as well as review of\nthe  parties' briefs on these issues and the language of the\nSettlement Agreement, I find Plaintiffs' objections are without\nmerit.\nI. AA/NA Language in 2004 Guidelines\nIn formulating the 2004 Guidelines, the MRP emphasized the\nimportance of abstinence from all illicit drug and alcohol use as\na prerequisite for Hepatitis C medication treatment.  Plaintiffs\ndo not dispute the importance of this factor.  Instead, Plaintiffs\ncontend that including language in the 2004 Guidelines referring\nto  participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and/or Narcotics\nAnonymous as a possible means to demonstrate inmate commitment to\nsuccessful treatment violates constitutional rights.  \nIf participation in AA a nd/or NA was  required as the only\nmeans to demonstrate commitment to risk behavior reduction or\nelimination, the court would agree with Plaintiff.  However, it is\nnot.   The current wording of the 2004 Guidelines presents AA\nand/or NA attendance as one alternative.  If an inmate expresses\n      3 - OPINION AND ORDER OF THE SPECIAL MASTER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 180    Filed 01/20/06    Page 4 of 6    Page ID#: 424\naversion  to self-help in the form of AA and/or NA meeting\nattendance, the 2004 Guidelines do not foreclose other means to\ndemonstrate an understanding and willingness to eliminate risk\nbehaviors and remain clean and sober.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs'\nobjection on this basis is without merit.\nII. Report on 2003 Guidelines\nPlaintiffs  also object to Defendants' position that the\nSettlement Agreement charged the MRP with preparing some form of\nreport  indicating whether the 2003 Guidelines failed to meet\ncommunity standards.  Plaintiffs argue that the fact the MRP felt\nthe  need to revise the 2003 Guidelines and issue new, 2004\nGuidelines, satisfies the Settlement Agreement.\nAgain, upon review of extensive notes from meetings with\ncounsel  and members of the MRP, the briefs submitted by the\nparties  on this issue, and the language of the Settlement\nAgreement, I disagree with Plaintiffs.\nOne  of the primary allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint\nagainst ODOC is that the 2003 Guidelines failed to meet community\nmedical standards.  In meetings with  counsel and the MRP, it\nbecame clear to the court and the parties that whether the 2003\nGuidelines did or did not meet community medical standards was a\nmedical rather than a legal decision, and thus would be best left\nto the MRP to determine.  The language of the Settlement Agreement\nreflects this determination, as it provides, in pertinent part:\n      4 - OPINION AND ORDER OF THE SPECIAL MASTER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 180    Filed 01/20/06    Page 5 of 6    Page ID#: 425\n2. Medical Review Panel and Review of Guidelines\n* * *\nb) The MRP shall review the Guidelines for the care\nof HCV within ODOC.  . . .\nc) The review process shall include the following\ncriteria and limitations:\nI.  The MRP shall assess the [2003] Guidelines\n[sic] compliance with the community standard fo care for\ntreatment of HCV ....\nii.   The MRP shall determine whether the\n[2003]  Guidelines reflect  a  reasonable community\nstandard  of care appropriate for the treatment of\nHepatitis C.  This analysis s hall be based upon the\nstandard of care for HCV, medically sound principles and\nevidence based outcome studies, where appropriate.\n* * *\nvii.  Upon completion of its review the MRP\nshall issue a written draft report to the parties ....\nThis  language contemplates a report from the MRP as to\nwhether the 2003 Guidelines, as a medical opinion, did or did not\nmeet  community medical standards at that time.  Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs' objection to such a report is without merit.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, I conclude that inclusion of language in\nthe  2004 Guidelines referring to participation in Alcoholics\nAnonymous  and/or Narcotics Anonymous does not violate the\nconstitutional  rights of inmates, and that the Settlement\nAgreement between the parties contemplated a final report from the\n      5 - OPINION AND ORDER OF THE SPECIAL MASTER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 180    Filed 01/20/06    Page 6 of 6    Page ID#: 426\nMRP stating a medical opinion on whether the 2003 Guidelines met\ncommunity medical standards.  \nObjections to this Opinion and Order, if any, may be filed\nwithin 20 days of the date hereof.  Response to the objections, if\nany, shall be filed 10 days thereafter.  If objections are filed,\nthey will be referred to the Hon orable Anna J.  Brown upon the\nfiling of a response to t he objections, or 10 days after the\nobjections are filed, whichever shall first occur.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED this  20th  day of January, 2006.\n   /s/ Donald C.

On December 5, 2002,\nthe parties submitted a Joint Statement of Class Definitions and\nObjections (#83) defining a proposed class.\nFor the reasons that follow and those expressed by the\nCourt on the record at the November 7, 2002, hearing, the Court\nGRANTS in part Plaintiffs' Motion.\nBACKGROUND\n      2 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 3 of 38    Page ID#: 92\nI. Amended Complaint\nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs challenge ODOC's\npractices and procedures for testing and treating HCV-positive\nde facto\ninmates.  Plaintiffs allege ODOC officials use   policies\nto delay and to deny testing and treating inmates for HCV. \nPlaintiffs also assert ODOC officials fail to follow their own\nwritten administrative procedures.\nPlaintiffs allege 77 separate claims for relief.  The first\n11 claims are designated as \"Challenges to Policies and\nProcedures:  All Plaintiffs/All Defendants.\"  Those claims are\nsummarized by Plaintiffs as follows:\nFirst Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim that ODOC\nHCV treatment policies violate the\nEighth Amendment prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual\npunishment.\nSecond Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (Americans With\nDisabilities Act) claim against\nthe State of Oregon that the ODOC\nHCV policies deny benefits by\nreason of disability.\nThird Claim: Oregon Constitution, Art. I, sec.\n16 claim that ODOC HCV policies\nconstitute cruel and unusual\npunishment.\nFourth Claim: Oregon Constitution, Art. 1, sec.\n13 claim that ODOC HCV policies\nconstitute unnecessary rigor.\nFifth Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Claim that ODOC\n\"Therapeutic Levels of Care\" (TLC)\n      3 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 4 of 38    Page ID#: 93\npolicies as applied violate the\nEighth Amendment prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual\npunishment.\nSixth Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 12101 ADA claim\nagainst all defendants that the\nHCV TLC policy denies benefits by\nreason of disability.\nSeventh Claim: Oregon Constitution, Art. I, sec.\n13 claim that ODOC TLC policies\nconstitute unnecessary rigor.\nEighth Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 1997e claim that ODOC\ngrievance procedures are\nadministered in such a fashion\nthat exhaustion of administrative\nremedies as required by Sec. 1997e\nviolates the Eighth Amendment\nprohibition against cruel and\nunusual punishment.\nNinth Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 1997e claim that ODOC\ngrievance procedures are\nadministered in such a fashion\nthat exhaustion of administrative\nremedies as required by Sec. 1997e\nviolates due process rights under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\nTenth Claim: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim that ODOC\ngrievance procedures are\nadministered in such a fashion\nthat exhaustion of administrative\nremedies as required by Sec. 1997e\nviolates Plaintiffs' right of\naccess to the courts under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment.\nEleventh Claim: Oregon Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 8 and\n20 claim that ODOC grievance procedures\nare administered in such a fashion that\nexhaustion of administrative remedies\nas required by Sec. 1997e violates\n      4 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 5 of 38    Page ID#: 94\nPlaintiffs' right of access to the\ncourts.\nThe remaining 66 claims for relief relate directly to the\nindividual Plaintiffs' allegations.  In their Amended Complaint,\nhowever, Plaintiffs designate this section as \"Allegations of\nClass Representatives Typical of Entire Class\" and allege:\nDefendants use as the basis for denial for\ntreatment of HCV a finite list of reasons as\nexemplified by the claims set forth for each\nnamed Plaintiff.  The Class alleges that the\nallegations, factual recitations and grievance\ndenials are uniform throughout the prison system\nand are typified by those set forth in the\nindividual Plaintiffs [sic] chronologies.\nThe claims alleged with respect to each individual Plaintiff\nfall into three categories:  (1) 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims for\ndenial of medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; (2) violations\nof the Oregon Constitution, Article I, Section 16, prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment; and (3) medical\nnegligence.  \nPlaintiffs seek general damages, costs, and attorneys'\nfees.  Plaintiffs also seek the following injunctive relief:\n1. To cease future reliance on, use or application of the\nunconstitutional and medically unsound HCV Policy\nincluding any application of the TLC policies as are\nrelevant;\n2. Plaintiffs further seek orders directing ODOC to\nmodify the existing HCV Policy to comply with existing\nmedical standards including, for example and without\n      5 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 6 of 38    Page ID#: 95\nlimitation, those promulgated by the CDC, acceptable\nmedical literature, and procedures used by the United\nStates Bureau of Prisons;\n3. Plaintiffs additionally seeks orders mandating that\nall inmates receive testing for the presence of HCV\nvirus and that those testing positive be provided with\nan ongoing evaluation of the progress and extent of\nthe infection;\n4. Plaintiffs seek orders mandating that ODOC immediately\nbegin to implement procedures designed to contain the\nspread of the virus including, without limitation,\nmodifying hygienic procedures to ban the shared use of\npersonal items such as razors, combs, brushes, and\nother devices;\n5. Plaintiffs seek orders mandating ODOC immediately\nbegin a system wide distribution of information and\neducation to teach inmates about the causes, effects,\nsymptoms and treatment protocols for HCV infection.\n6. Plaintiffs seek orders creating a new panel of experts\ncreated from existing ODOC medical providers, national\nexperts in evaluation and treatment of HCV, and\ninfectious disease experts to evaluate HCV treatment\npolicies, to evaluate specific patient charts to make\ntreatment decisions based upon existing medical\nstandards, and to insure those recommendations are\ncarried out expeditiously and without further danger\nto the health and safety of infected inmates;\n7. Plaintiffs seek orders directed toward ODOC to\nevaluate the use of outside financial resources to\nassist inmates infected with HCV to obtain medical\nrecords, consult with outside experts and to receive\nany and all necessary treatment; and\n8. Plaintiffs seek orders mandating that ODOC immediately\nbegin to treat all inmates in the custody of the State\nof Oregon who are infected with HCV and who have\nchronic HCV with ongoing indicators for combination\ndrug therapy in accord with the standard of care in\nthe community as a whole.\nAm.

Compl. at 66.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive\ndamages of no less than $100,000 against each individual\nId\nDefendant in an amount to be determined after trial.   .\nII. Motion to Certify Class\nPlaintiffs move for designation of a class pursuant to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(a) consisting of \"all past, present and future\ninmates of the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) and who\nhave been, are or will be infected with the virus Hepatitis C\n(HCV) while under the custody and control of the ODOC.\"  Mot. to\nCertify Class at 2.  Plaintiffs also seek to include in the\nclass \"any persons asserting the right to sue the Defendants\nindependently or derivatively by reason of their personal\nrelationship or contact with members of the Class and who\nId.  \nthereafter contracted the HCV virus.\"  \n      7 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 8 of 38    Page ID#: 97\nThe Court heard oral argument on Plaintiffs' Motion to\nCertify Class on November 7, 2002.  At the conclusion of that\nhearing, the Court found plaintiffs met the class requirements\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and qualified for class\ncertification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The Court held a\nclass would be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) for the purpose of\ninjunctive relief only.  The Court also found Plaintiffs'\nproposed class definition was too broad and ordered the parties\nto confer and to submit a joint proposal stating an \"adequately\n \nnarrow definition\" of the class.\nIII. Joint Statement of Class Definition and Objections\nOn December 5, 2002, the parties submitted their Joint\nStatement of Class Definition and Objections.  In the Joint\nStatement, the parties agree the Rule 23(b)(2) class should\nconsist of:\nAll inmates who are infected with the HCV\nvirus and who are in the custody and control\nof the Oregon Department of Corrections.\nThe parties further agree the proposed class, consisting of\npresently-incarcerated inmates, is a mandatory class with no\nright of opt-out.\nThe parties do not agree, however, on two issues. \nPlaintiffs seek a subclass of formerly incarcerated inmates who\n      8 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 9 of 38    Page ID#: 98\nwere infected with HCV virus during the time of their\nincarceration.  Plaintiffs also request this Court to exercise\nits discretion to require Defendants to provide notice of the\nRule 23(b)(2) class certification to individuals who are\nincarcerated by posting a single page on the bulletin board of\neach prison library and in the various living quarters in each\nprison.  Defendants object to both requests.\nSTANDARDS\nA party who seeks to certify a class under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23 must meet all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least\none of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Rule 23 provides in\npertinent part:\n(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more\nmembers of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all only if\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable, (2) there are questions\nof law or fact common to the class, (3) the\nclaims or defenses of the representative parties\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass, and (4) the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of\nthe class.\n(b) Class Actions Maintainable. An action may be\nmaintained as a class action if the prerequisites\nof subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in\naddition:\n      9 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 10 of 38    Page ID#: 99\n*  *  *\n(2) the party opposing the class has acted\nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable\nto the class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole; or\n(3) the court finds that the questions of\nlaw or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nThe matters pertinent to the findings include:\n(A) the interest of members of the class in\nindividually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions; (B) the extent and\nnature of any litigation concerning the\ncontroversy already commenced by or against\nmembers of the class; (C) the desirability or\nundesirability of concentrating the litigation of\nthe claims in the particular forum; (D) the\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in the\nmanagement of a class action.  \nThe decision to grant or to deny class certification is\nJordan v. County of Los\nwithin the trial court's discretion.  \nAngeles vacated on other\n, 669 F.2d 1311, 1318 (9th Cir.), \ngrounds\n, 459 U.S. 810 (1982).

Litig.\n, 693 F.2d 847, 854\ncert. denied\n(9th Cir. 1982),  , 459 U.S. 1171 (1983).  A class\nmay be certified only if the court is satisfied \"after a\nrigorous analysis that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp.\nbeen satisfied.\"   , 976 F.2d 497, \n      10 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 11 of 38    Page ID#: 100\nGeneral Tele. Co. of Southwest v.\n509 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing \nFalcon\n, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982)). \nFor purposes of ruling on a motion to certify class, the\ncourt must take the substantive allegations of the complaint \nBlackie v. Barrack\nas true.   , 524 F.2d 891, 901 n.17 (9th Cir.\ncert. denied\n1975),  , 429 U.S. 816 (1976).  The court's\ndetermination of class certification does not permit a\nId.\npreliminary inquiry into the merits.     In addition, an\nextensive evidentiary showing by the plaintiffs is not required\nas long as the court has sufficient material before it to\ndetermine the nature of the allegations and to rule on\nId.\ncompliance with the requirements of Rule 23.  \nDISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs contend the four requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a) are met because:\n1. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members\nis impracticable;\n2. There are common questions of law or fact;\n3. The claims/defenses of representative parties are\ntypical; and\n4. The representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\n      11 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 12 of 38    Page ID#: 101\nPlaintiffs also assert the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b) are met because:\n1. Defendants have acted in a concerted manner to\ndeny treatment to all members of the class.  \nThis pattern and practice is uniform to the\nentire class and not particularized with respect\nto an individual.\n2. Class claims for injunctive relief predominate\nover individual particularized claims for relief.\n3. A class action will be superior to other methods\nof adjudication.\nI. Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)\nA. Rule 23(a)(1) - Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires the proposed class to be \"so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" \nPlaintiffs must show the number of purported class members by\nsome reasonable estimate.  The mere allegation that the class is\nZeidman v. J.\ntoo numerous to join all members is insufficient.  \nRay McDermott & Co See\n., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981).  \nalso Pederson v. Louisiana State Univ.\n  , 213 F.3d 858, 868 (5th\nCir. 2000).  Plaintiffs, however, are not required to set forth\nGeneral\nwith specificity the exact number of class members.  \nTelephone Co. v. EEOC\n, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980) (numerosity\nrequirement imposes no absolute limitation, but requires\nexamination of specific facts of each case).  \n      12 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 13 of 38    Page ID#: 102\nWhen the putative class size reaches substantial\nproportions, the impracticability of joinder is usually\nSteinbrecher v. Oswego Police\nsatisfied by numbers alone.  \nOfficer Dickey\n, 138 F. Supp. 2d 1103, 1106 (N.D. Ill. 2001). \nSee also Sorenson v. Concannon\n  , 893 F. Supp. 1469, 1478 n.12 \n(D. Or. 1994) (although the absolute number of class members \nis not the sole determining factor, joinder will usually be\nimpractical when the class is large).

Supp. at 1478 n.12 (at least hundreds of\napplicants as well as unknown future applicants denied\ndisability benefits).\nSeveral nonexclusive factors are also relevant to the\nnumerosity inquiry; namely, judicial economy by avoiding\nmultiple actions, geographic dispersion of proposed class\nmembers, financial resources and ability of class members to\ninstitute individual suits, and the possibility that injunctive\nrelief could lead to inconsistent results without class\nOregon Laborers-Employers Health & Welfare Trust\ncertification.  \n      13 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 14 of 38    Page ID#: 103\nFund v.

Cal.\n1988).\nPlaintiffs estimate the putative class size to be at least\nbetween 3300 and 5500 based on ODOC's estimates of the number of\nHCV-infected inmates.  Plaintiffs note approximately 400 inmates\nfrom almost every prison facility in the state have contacted\nand retained Plaintiffs' counsel to date.  Plaintiffs argue the\nputative class consists of inmates in 12 prisons located in\nvarious geographic regions of the State of Oregon as well as\nthose inmates now housed out of state pursuant to Interstate\nCompact Agreements and other transfers.  Most inmates have\nlimited resources and are unable to provide for their own\nmedical care, to pay for medical records, to obtain competent\nlegal counsel, or to access medical research and information.  \nDefendants do not directly address Plaintiffs' arguments on\nnumerosity.  Instead they argue generally that Plaintiffs have\nnot produced any \"information indicating the actual number of\npotential class members that have been clinically determined to\nrequire combination therapy\" and have not \"demonstrated whether\nit is impracticable to join these individuals in a single suit.\" \nNo analysis of relevant case law is offered.\n      14 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 15 of 38    Page ID#: 104\nThe Court finds Defendants' argument is too narrow:  The\nunderlying issue is the creation of and adherence to appropriate\nadministrative procedures for identification and treatment of\nHCV-positive inmates rather than identification of inmates who\nrequire combination drug therapy.  Accepting Plaintiffs'\nallegations as true, the Court further finds all factors weigh\nin Plaintiffs' favor on this issue.  Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes Plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity require-\nment. \nB. Rule 23(a)(2) - Commonality\nPursuant to Rule 23(a)(2), plaintiffs who seek class\ncertification must establish \"there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.\"  The commonality requirement does not\nrequire every question of law or fact to be common to every\nHanlon v. Chrysler Corp\nmember of the class.   ., 150 F.3d 1011,\n1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  \"The existence of shared legal issues\nwith divergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common\ncore of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies\nId.\nwithin the class.\"     \nIf material variations exist regarding the law or facts\npertaining to individual class members' alleged injuries, the\nLaDuke v. Nelson\ncommonality requirement cannot be met.   , 762\nopinion amended by\nF.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985),   796 F.2d 309\n      15 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 16 of 38    Page ID#: 105\n(1986).  Commonality may be satisfied, however, when the\nplaintiffs bring an action that challenges a system-wide\npractice or policy affecting all putative class members. \nArmstrong v. Davis\n, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing\nLaDuke cert. denied\n, 762 F.2d at 1323),  ,      S. Ct.     , 2002\nWL 704375 (2002).  Even if the court finds it must examine some\nindividual facts, commonality is not necessarily destroyed.\nPlaintiffs do not request review of individual\ndenials of benefits, but rather seek judicial\nsystem\nreview of the disability determination  .\nNonetheless, in order to reveal systemic flaws in\nthe disability determination procedure, the court\nmust examine some individual facts because an\nunlawful, systemwide procedure is proven by a\nsufficient number of individual cases evidencing\nsuch a defect.  However, this inquiry is\ndifferent than the detailed scrutiny of case\nspecific facts required when reviewing individual\ndenials of benefits.\nPlaintiffs' claims involve common questions of\nlaw and fact because (1) they challenge system-\nwide procedures applicable to all class members\nand (2) all class members requested disability\nbenefits which were denied at the initial or\nreconsideration stages.  \nSorenson\n, 893 F. Supp. at 1479.\nHere Plaintiffs argue Defendants have engaged in a\nconcerted, systematic, purposeful denial of treatment to all\nHCV-infected inmates in the Oregon correctional system. \nPlaintiffs present evidence to show every inmate's request for\n      16 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 17 of 38    Page ID#: 106\ntreatment of the condition has been denied initially, and the\ninmates have been forced to satisfy innumerable and ever-\nchanging administrative hurdles before treatment is even\nconsidered.  Moreover, according to Plaintiffs, there is\nevidence of an overall theme in ODOC to the effect that \"we do\nnot treat Hep C.\"  \nDefendants counter with the argument that there is no\nblanket ODOC policy that applies to each individual Plaintiff's\nmedical care and treatment:  \"Because the patient care decisions\nmade by ODOC practitioners are based on individual patient care\nneeds, each inmate patient will appropriately receive different\ninformation, testing and therapy from the treating physician.\" \nDefs. Opp'n to Mot. for Class Certification, Dr. Shelton Aff.\nEx. 101 ¶ 19.  Defendants point to a multiplicity of reasons for\ndenial of inmate treatment requests and argue a determination as\nto whether each named Plaintiff's denial of treatment is\nappropriate would entail a detailed examination of the facts\npertinent to each individual Plaintiff.\nThe Court, however, finds Plaintiffs have established the\ncommonality requirement, at least with respect to their claims\nthat Defendants systematically denied treatment, and their\nclaims for injunctive relief.  In addition, the Court further\nfinds Defendants' \"multiplicity\" of reasons for denial of inmate\n      17 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 18 of 38    Page ID#: 107\ntreatment are, in fact, indicative of ODOC's overall practice of\nnontreatment.\nC. Rule 23(a)(3) - Typicality\nThe typicality requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) is\nsatisfied if \"the claims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" \nTypicality focuses on the similarity between the named\nplaintiffs' legal and remedial theories and the legal and\nremedial theories of those of the putative class members. \nLightbourn v. County of El Paso, Tex.\n, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th\ncert. denied\nCir.),  , 522 U.S. 1052 (1998).  A plaintiff's claim\nis typical if it arises from the same event, practice, or course\nof conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members\nRosario v. Livaditis\nand is based on the same legal theories.   ,\ncert. denied\n963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992),  , 506 U.S. 1051\n(1993).  In other words, the test for typicality is \"whether\nother members have the same or similar injury, whether the\naction is based on conduct which is not unique to the named\nplaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured \nFreedman v. Louisiana-Pacific\nby the same course of conduct.\"  \nCorp. Welling v.\n, 922 F. Supp. 377, 399 (D. Or. 1996) (quoting \nAlexy\n, 156 F.R.D. 654, 657 (N.D. Cal. 1994)).  Although claims\nmust arise from the same remedial and legal theories, they do\n      18 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 19 of 38    Page ID#: 108\nSmith v. U. of Wash. Law School\nnot have to be identical.   , 2 F.\nSupp. 2d 1324 (W.D. Wa. 1998).  \nThe purpose of the typicality requirement is to ensure the\nclass representative is properly motivated to protect the\nFreedman,\ninterests of class members.    922 F. Supp. at 399.   \nCommonality and typicality are separate, distinct inquiries even\nthough the prerequisites are similar.  The court considers the\nsufficiency of the named plaintiffs to determine commonality,\nbut the court evaluates the sufficiency of the class itself to\nMueller v. CBS, Inc.\ndetermine typicality.   , 200 F.R.D. 227\n(W.D. Pa. 2001).  \nPlaintiffs argue the low threshold of typicality is\nsatisfied.  They assert the 11 named class representatives were\nselected because they were the recipients of Defendants' typical\nconduct:  All Plaintiffs were denied treatment; all were forced\nto participate in lengthy, dilatory grievance procedures; all\nhad HCV and had been requesting treatment for several years; and\nall were the recipients of a cross-section of reasons given by\nODOC for denial of treatment.  In addition, the remedial\ntheories pertaining to the injunctive relief sought would apply\nto the putative class even though Plaintiffs do not specifically\nargue this point.\n      19 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 20 of 38    Page ID#: 109\nDefendants argue the named Plaintiffs are not typical of\nthe proposed class because they have been diagnosed with chronic\nHCV infections while the proposed class would consist of many\nindividuals who may or may not develop chronic HCV infections. \nMoreover, Defendants argue many of the proposed class will never\nbe under the medical care of ODOC and, in any event, may not\nrequire treatment because they might clear the virus\nspontaneously.  Finally, Defendants argue the named Plaintiffs\nhave been tested for HCV, the named Plaintiffs have varying\nstages of disease progression, and some of the named Plaintiffs\nare now receiving treatment. \nAlthough it is a closer call on this element, the Court,\nnonetheless, finds Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality\nrequirement.  Although their individual medical conditions\ndiffer, the fact remains they all were initially denied testing\nand treatment as part of what Plaintiffs allege is a deliberate,\nsystematic plan.  Plaintiffs' claims arise from the same\npractice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of\nother class members and are based on the same legal theories.\nD. Rule 23(a)(4) - Adequate Representation\nPlaintiffs who seek class certification are required by\nRule 23(a)(4) to establish \"the representative parties will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\"  This\n      20 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 21 of 38    Page ID#: 110\nrequirement serves to uncover conflicts of interest between\nAmchem\nnamed parties and the class they seek to represent.  \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor\n, 521 U.S. 591 (1997).  \nThe \"adequacy\" requirement consists of two distinct\nfactors:\n(1) that the representative party's attorney be\nqualified, experienced and generally able to\nconduct the litigation; and (2) that the suit not\nbe collusive and plaintiff's interests not be\nantagonistic to those of the remainder of the\nclass. . . .  In determining adequacy, the court\nmust scrutinize the ability of the named\nrepresentative to represent the interests of the\nclass fairly and adequately.\nFreedman\n, 922 F. Supp. at 399 (internal citations omitted).  In\nother words, representation is adequate when:  (1) the attorney\nrepresenting the class is qualified and competent, (2) the class\nrepresentative does not have interests antagonistic to the\nremainder of the class, and (3) the class representative has\nsufficient interest in the outcome of the case to ensure\nIrwin v. Mascott\nvigorous advocacy.   , 96 F. Supp. 2d 968 (N.D.\nCal. 1999).\nThe Court finds Plaintiffs present evidence and argument\nsufficient to establish the adequacy requirements.  In addition,\nthe Court finds counsel is qualified and competent, the named\nPlaintiffs do not have interests antagonistic to the remainder\n      21 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 22 of 38    Page ID#: 111\nof the class, and the named Plaintiffs have sufficient interest\nin the outcome of the case to ensure vigorous advocacy.\nII. Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3)\nIn addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs\nmust satisfy the requirements of one of the three subsections of\nRule 23(b).  Plaintiffs contend the putative class is in\ncompliance with both 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3).\nA. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)\nAn action under Rule 23 may be maintained if all of the\nconditions of 23(a) are met and, in addition,\n[t]he party opposing the class has acted or\nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to\nthe class, thereby making appropriate final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief with respect to the class as a whole.\nClass certification under Rule 23(b)(2) does not require the\nprocedural safeguards of notice and opt-out that are required\nunder Rule 23(b)(3).  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are\nintended to assist litigants in seeking widespread institutional\nWeigman v.\nreform through injunctive and/or declaratory relief.  \nGlorious Foods, Inc.\n, 169 F.R.D. 280 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  \nTo satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the movant\nmust establish two elements:  (1) the behavior is generally\n      22 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 23 of 38    Page ID#: 112\napplicable to the class as a whole and (2) the injunctive relief\nBolin v. Sears, Roebuck &\nsought predominates over damages.  \nCo.\n, 231 F.3d 970, 975 (5th Cir. 2000). \n1. Behavior Generally Applicable to Class as a Whole\nUnder Rule 23(b)(2), certification is improper if the\nmerits of the claims turn on defendants' individual dealings\nId\nwith each plaintiff.   .  Rule 23(b)(2), however, does not\nrequire every single class member to have been injured or\naggrieved in the same way by defendants' conduct.  It is\nsufficient if defendants have adopted a pattern of conduct that\nHaley\nis likely to be the same as to all members of the class.  \nv. Medtronics, Inc.\n, 169 F.R.D. 643 (C.D. Cal. 1996).  \nHere Plaintiffs argue Defendants have acted in a\nconcerted manner to deny treatment for HCV to all members of the\nputative class.  They allege Defendants only test and evaluate\nan infected inmate if the inmate brings a legal action or\ninitiates the grievance process.  Plaintiffs further allege\nDefendants have denied treatment to all inmates who have filed\nformal grievances.  Again, Plaintiffs provide direct evidence\nthat ODOC officials have repeatedly made clear that ODOC \"does\nnot treat Hep C.\"\nDefendants counter again that there is no ODOC policy\nfor treating or denying treatment to HCV-infected inmates.  They\n      23 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 24 of 38    Page ID#: 113\nargue some members of the putative class, as defined by\nPlaintiffs, have never had treatment denied because they do not\nrequire treatment, have not been infected yet (and may never be\ninfected), or are not currently incarcerated.  Because\nDefendants do not have a single practice or policy that\nuniformly affects all class members, Defendants argue the\nproposed class fails to meet the requirement that Defendants'\nbehavior generally apply to the class as a whole.\n2. Predominance of Injunctive Relief\nCertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate only\nwhen equitable claims predominate, injunctive relief is sought\nin favor of the class as a whole, and monetary claims are merely\nAllison v. Citgo\nincidental to the requested injunctive relief.  \nPetroleum Corp\n., 151 F.3d 402, 411 (5th Cir. 1998).  Under this\nstandard, monetary relief predominates when its presence in the\nlitigation suggests procedural safeguards of notice and opt-out\nare necessary.  This means, in effect, monetary relief is less\nof a group remedy and depends more on varying circumstances and\nId\nthe merits of each potential class member's case.   .  \nClass certification under Rule 23(b)(2) may be\nappropriate if injunctive relief is a significant aspect of the\nrelief sought even though damages may eventually be awarded. \nIrwin v. Mascott See also Ballard v.\n, 96 F. Supp. 2d at 979.    \n      24 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 25 of 38    Page ID#: 114\nEquifax Check Servs., Inc.\n, 186 F.R.D. 589 (E.D. Cal. 1999)\n(certification may include actions in which monetary damages are\nsought if that request is secondary to the request for\nMayhew v. Cohen\ninjunctive or declaratory relief);  , 604 F. Supp.\n850 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (when court certifies class on injunction\nissues and treats damages claims as incidental, a money award is\nnot inconsistent with class certification).\nCourts consider three factors to determine whether\ndamages are incidental:  (1) whether class members automatically\nwould be entitled to the kind of damages sought; (2) whether\nsuch damages can be computed by \"objective standards\" rather\nthan standards that rely on the intangible, subjective\ndifferences of each class member's circumstances; and (3)\nwhether a determination of such damages would require additional\nId\nhearings.   .  Punitive damages are not considered incidental\nto class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief because punitive\ndamages are dependent on nonincidental compensatory damages,\nrequire proof of each plaintiff's damage, introduce new and\nsubstantially legal and factual issues, and are not capable of\n  Id.\ncomputation by reference to objective standards.\n          Plaintiffs contend they have alleged a long, detailed\nlist of injunctive and equitable relief that predominates over\nany particularized claim for damages.  For example, Plaintiffs\n      25 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 26 of 38    Page ID#: 115\nseek testing and evaluation for all infected individuals.  They\nfurther seek orders directing ODOC to cease using medically\nunsound procedures and protocols; to cease using TLC and\ngrievance procedures to deny treatment; and to create a panel of\nexperts to review infected inmates medical files, to create new\nprotocols and treatment plans, to create new methods of charting\nmedical conditions, and to mandate treatment for all inmates who\nrequire treatment based on new, medically-sound protocols. \nPlaintiffs further contend the purpose of this litigation is to\nchange the status quo and to provide life-saving treatment\nprocedures for all infected inmates.\nDefendants argue the injunctive relief sought is\ninextricably intermingled with Plaintiffs' claims for damages. \nDefendants further argue the damages claim is not incidental\nbecause the damages calculations in this case are individual and\nwould require the Court's consideration of the Plaintiffs'\nindividual factual claims and subjective circumstances.\nThe Court finds the compensatory and punitive damages\nsought by Plaintiffs in this action are not \"incidental\" as\nrequired by Rule 23(b)(2).  The damages could not be computed by\nobjective standards, and the Court would require additional\nhearings to determine damages.  As such, for purposes of class\ncertification, it would not be appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2)\n      26 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 27 of 38    Page ID#: 116\nfor the Court to consider these damages allegations of the\nAmended Complaint.  Certification is appropriate, however, on\nthe limited issues of liability and injunctive relief.\nAlthough the amount and relative importance of\nmonetary damages available to members of the proposed class may\nvary widely in this action, the injunctive relief sought is\nlikely to be important to every member of the class.  Plaintiffs\nallege Defendants deliberately and systematically refuse to test\nfor and to treat HCV.  The injunctive relief Plaintiffs request\nwould determine definitively the propriety of ODOC's practices\nwith respect to all members of the class and, if granted, would\nrequire ODOC to implement some means of ensuring testing and\ntreatment. \nB. Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)\nAn action may also be maintained as a class action if the\nrequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied and, in addition,\n* * *\n(2) the court finds that the questions of law or\nfact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members, and that a class action is\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nThe matters pertinent to the findings include:\n      27 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 28 of 38    Page ID#: 117\n(A) the interest of members of the class in\nindividually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions; (B) the extent and\nnature of any litigation concerning the\ncontroversy already commenced by or against\nmembers of the class; (C) the desirability or\nundesirability of concentrating the litigation of\nthe claims in the particular forum; (D) the\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in the\nmanagement of a class action.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  These requirements are referred to as\nIn re Northern Dist.\npredominance and superiority respectively.  \nof Cal. Dalkon Shield\n, 693 F.2d at 855.\n1. Predominance of Common Questions\nTo determine whether common questions of law or fact\npredominate, the court first must identify the substantive\nissues raised by the action and the applicable defenses and then\ninquire into the proof relevant to each issue.  Judge William W.\nRutter Group Prac. Guide:  Fed. Civ. Pro.\nSchwarzer et al., \nBefore Trial Simer v. Rios\n ¶ 10-70.1 (2002) (citing  , 661 F.2d\n655, 672 (7th Cir. 1981)).  The court's inquiry focuses on the\nLocal\nrelationship between the common and individual issues.  \nJoint Exec. Bd. of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas\nSands, Inc. cert. denied\n, 244 F.3d 1152, 1162 (9th Cir.),  , 122\nS. Ct. 395 (2001).  \nThe presence of commonality alone is not sufficient \n      28 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 29 of 38    Page ID#: 118\nto fulfill this requirement.  When common questions represent a\nsignificant aspect of the case and the questions can be resolved\nfor all members of the class in a single adjudication, however,\nthere is a clear justification for handling the dispute on a\nHanlon v.\nrepresentative rather than an individual basis.  \nChrysler Corp.\n, 150 F.3d at 1022.  \nNeither party undertakes significant analysis of this\nfactor.  In fact, all of the parties rely on the same factors to\nsupport their opposing positions and note each Plaintiff's case\nwill require the Court to make the following determinations: \n(1) is he HCV positive, (2) does he have acute or chronic HCV\ninfection, (3) at what stage is his disease, (4) does the stage\nof his disease warrant further diagnostic tests, (5) is\ncombination therapy appropriate or medically necessary, \n(6) would other therapies be more appropriate, (7) is ODOC \naware of his medical condition, (8) is ODOC providing medically\nnecessary treatment, and (9) is ODOC's refusal to provide a\nparticular procedure or treatment sufficiently harmful to\nestablish deliberate indifference to serious medical needs for\nthe purposes of Eighth Amendment claims?  \nDefendants also argue this case at its core involves\nindividual inmates' claims of constitutional violations based on\nthe individual medical care received or the absence of such\n      29 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 30 of 38    Page ID#: 119\ncare.  Defendants further argue the constitutionality of each\ninmate's medical treatment must be assessed individually, and a\nconclusion in one case may not foreclose a different conclusion\nin another.  \n2. Superiority of Class Action \nThe fact that common questions predominate is not\nsufficient to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The court also\nmust find that bringing a class action is superior to bringing\nindividual actions to resolve the dispute.  \"This\n'manageability' requirement includes consideration of the\npotential difficulties in notifying class members of the suit,\ncalculation of individual damages, and distribution of damages.\" \nSix (6) Mexican Workers v. Arizona Citrus Growers\n, 904 F.2d\n1301, 1304 (9th Cir. 1990).  Rule 23 lists four factors the\ncourt must consider to determine whether bringing a class action\nis superior to bringing individual actions:\n(A) the interest of members of the class in\nindividually controlling the prosecution or\ndefense of separate actions;\n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation\nconcerning the controversy already commenced by\nor against members of the class;\n(C) the desirability or undesirability of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the\nparticular forum;\n      30 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 31 of 38    Page ID#: 120\n(D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in\nthe management of a class action.\nA class action may be superior to other methods of\nadjudication when class-wide litigation of common issues will\nreduce litigation costs and promote greater efficiency.  A class\naction is not a superior method of adjudication, however, when\nan individual class member would be compelled to try numerous\nand substantial issues to establish a right to recover\nindividually after liability to the class was established. \nO'Connor v. Boeing North American, Inc.\n, 197 F.R.D. 404 (C.D.\nCal. 2000).  \nPlaintiffs contend a class action would be superior to\nindividual actions because class members are generally located\nin various geographic venues, most members are highly motivated\nto seek treatment for HCV, and members will undoubtedly seek to\nfile individual actions if they cannot litigate through the\nmedium of a class action.  Plaintiffs note a high probability of\nnumerous additional individual actions that may differ only as\nto the damages sought.  Plaintiffs further argue all of the\ngeneral issues of liability will be identical against the same\npool of defendants.  Defendants provide no legal analysis on\nthis element.\n      31 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 32 of 38    Page ID#: 121\nAfter considering Plaintiffs' arguments, the Court\nfinds Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the certification requirements\nunder Rule 23(b)(3).  Particularly in light of the broad class\ndefinition proposed by Plaintiffs, it would be difficult to\nsatisfy notification requirements, to calculate individual\ndamages, and to determine the appropriate distribution of\ndamages.  Indeed, the damages portion of Plaintiffs' Amended\nComplaint demonstrates how individualized each determination\nwould be.  The Court also finds the disparity in the stage of\ndisease of each Plaintiff, the individual factors that will\naffect the type of treatment for each Plaintiff, and the amount\nof damages actually suffered by each Plaintiff all dictate\nagainst a finding of predominance and superiority.  \nC. Deferral of Decision on Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify\nClass\nFinally, Defendants ask the Court to defer consideration \nof Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class until after the Court\nconsiders Defendants' as-yet-unfiled Motion for Summary Judg-\nment.  According to the Court's Order issued on September 12,\n2002, dispositive motions are due by April 30, 2003.  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(c)(1) provides \"[a]s soon as practicable after the\ncommencement of an action brought as a class action, the court\nshall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained.\" \n      32 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 33 of 38    Page ID#: 122\nAccordingly, the Court finds deferral is not warranted. \nMoreover, the issue Defendants apparently will seek to resolve\nby summary judgment is the very issue on which class\ncertification is most justified:  whether injunctive relief is\nnecessary.\nIII. Class Definition and Notice\nA. Class Definition\nThe parties agree to certification of a mandatory class\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) consisting of \"all inmates who\nare infected with the HCV virus and who are in the custody and\ncontrol of the Oregon Department of Corrections.\"  Over\nDefendants' objection, Plaintiffs also seek an additional sub-\nclass of formerly incarcerated individuals to be defined as\nfollows:  \"all inmates who were incarcerated under the control\nand custody of [the] Oregon Department of Corrections and who\nwere infected with the HCV virus during the time of their\nincarceration.\"\nDefendants argue the proposed subclass would be\ninappropriate because the Rule 23(b)(2) class is limited to\ninjunctive relief, which is necessarily current or prospective. \nBecause former inmates are no longer under the care and custody\nof ODOC, injunctive relief is not available to them.  Further,\nretroactive relief or determination of liability for a subclass\n      33 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 34 of 38    Page ID#: 123\nwould depend on the determination of each former inmate's\nindividual medical circumstances.\nRule 23(b)(2) is not limited, however, solely to injunctive\nrelief.  Class certification is available under this rule if\n[t]he party opposing the class has acted or\nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to\nthe class, thereby making appropriate final\nor corresponding declaratory\ninjunctive relief \nrelief\n with respect to the class as a whole.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (emphasis added).  \nHere a finding that injunctive relief is warranted also\nwill require a corresponding finding of declaratory relief that\nDefendants' practices and policies concerning the testing and\ntreatment of HCV violate the rights of those subject to those\npractices and policies.  If former inmates who were infected\nwith HCV at the time of their incarceration are excluded from\nthe class, they will not be bound by any determination of\ndeclaratory relief herein.  Instead they will be required to re-\nlitigate the subject matter of this case and thereby increase\nthe likelihood of inconsistent outcomes, which is the very\nresult Rule 23 seeks to avoid.  Accordingly, the Court grants\nPlaintiffs' request for a subclass of formerly incarcerated\nindividuals for the purposes of declaratory relief only.\nB. Notice\n      34 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 35 of 38    Page ID#: 124\nFinally, Plaintiffs request the Court to require Defendants\nto provide notice of this action to currently incarcerated class\nmembers by posting a single page on the bulletin board of each\nprison library and in the various living quarters in each prison\nand by including an announcement in each facility's regularly-\npublished newsletter.  Defendants object and argue notice does\nnot serve any legitimate purpose because the proposed class is\nmandatory with no opt-out provisions.\nA class certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for\nStoetzner v. U.S.\nequitable relief does not require notice.  \nSteel Corp. Wetzel v.\n, 897 F.2d 115, 119 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing \nLiberty Mutual Ins. Co. cert.\n, 508 F.2d 239, 254 (3d Cir.), \ndenied\n, 421 U.S. 1011 (1975)).  \"Under Rule 23(d)(2), however, a\ncourt may require appropriate notice 'for the protection of the\nmembers of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the\nQuern v. Jordan See\naction.'\"   , 440 U.S. 332, 335 n.3 (1979).  \nalso Molski v. Gleich\n  , 307 F.3d 1155, 1170 (9th Cir. 2002).\nIn their Amended Complaint and the evidence submitted in\nsupport of their Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs\nraise significant questions as to the ability of ODOC inmates to\nobtain information about HCV testing and treatment. \nAccordingly, the Court finds the form of notice Plaintiffs\nrequest will serve to protect the members of the class and to\n      35 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 36 of 38    Page ID#: 125\npromote fairness in this action.  No later than January 13,\n2003, the parties shall submit to the Court their joint proposal\nfor a form of notice to be posted by Defendants on the bulletin\nboard of each prison library and in the various living quarters\nin each prison and to be included in the regularly-published\nnewsletter in each facility.  On Court approval of the proposed\nform of notice, Defendants shall complete the notification\nprocess within 30 days.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court finds the interests of justice\nare best served by certifying a limited class under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(b)(2) solely for the determination of liability and\ninjunctive relief.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS in part\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class (#16).  \nThe Court certifies a class for the purposes of declaratory\nand injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)\nconsisting of the following members:  All inmates who are\ninfected with the HCV virus and who are in the custody and\ncontrol of the Oregon Department of Corrections.  The Court also\ncertifies a subclass for the purpose of declaratory relief only\nconsisting of:  All inmates who were incarcerated under the\ncontrol and custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections and\n      36 - OPINION AND ORDER -\n\nCase 3:01-cv-01619-BR    Document 84    Filed 12/19/02    Page 37 of 38    Page ID#: 126\nwho were infected with the HCV virus during the time of their\nincarceration.  The class and subclass are mandatory with no\nright to opt-out.  \nFinally, the parties shall have until January 13, 2003, to\nsubmit to the Court their joint proposal for a form of notice to\nbe posted by Defendants on the bulletin board of each prison\nlibrary and in the various living quarters in each prison and to\nbe included in the regularly-published newsletter in each\nfacility.  On Court approval of the proposed form of notice,\nDefendants shall be allowed an additional 30 days to complete\nthe notification process.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED this 19th day of December, 2002.\n/s/ Anna J.

      "title": "Report from the Hepatitis C Medical Review Panel",
      "text": "REPORT FROM THE HEPATITIS C MEDICAL REVIEW PANEL \nMarch 21, 2007 \nThe panel was sent copies of23 charts in mid January 2007 by Oregon DOC.  Each member of the Panel \nreviewed each case independently and met twice (March 8 and 14,2007). Each case was discussed and a \nconsensus arrived at.  A summary table for all cases is provided below.  A consensus was arrived at \nregarding overall impressions.  Recommendations are made with what the panel believes are reasonable \ncommunity practices in mind. \nOverall the panel found 20 of the 23 cases to show Hepatitis C care generally consistent with the guidelines \nwith a number of suggestions made.  The Panel did not review care prior to 2006 for timeliness issues since \nthis issue was addressed in the prior review.  Our anecdotal impressions of present cases that were in DOC \nprior to 2006 however confirmed our previous review impressions. \nIt appears that since the MRP revised guidelines have been distributed that there is more attention to \ntimeliness of evaluation and treatment. There is some very good care of Hepatitis C occurring in DOC. \nWhile timeliness and overall care appear to have improved there are some areas DOC needs to focus on. \nImproving care is a constant process and these improvements should be seen as the next step in a continual \nprocess. The panel suggests: \n•  Documentation overall is fair to poor.  Despite the importance and prevalence of Hepatitis C there \nis not a single source of documentation in the medical record regarding Hep C care that includes \npresent status, past status, and decision making.  Correct decisions appear to be made but it is \ndifficult to be certain that decisions were made for the correct reason.  The current Hepatitis C \ninformation sheet needs to be improved to provide this type of information.  The TLC summaries \nprovide no information about the reason for decisions being made. The community practice for \ndocumentation is highly variable and it is likely that many community practices have similar \nissues with documentation. These patients however are the most risky DOC patients in many \nrespects and their documentation should be a priority, \n•  There is a lack of documented hepatology consultation especially in complex cases.  In some of \nthese cases consultation may have resulted in no treatment or anticipation of complications. There \nappears to be less consultation in DOC with hepatologists than there is in the community. \nExamples of cases needing hepatology consultation include: \no  Early cirrhosis \no  Simultaneous Hepatitis B \no  Treatment strategies especially in patients needing growth factors \no  Patients with seizure disorders \n•  Throughout the care of patients and medical record documentation, DOC needs to emphasize the \nimportance of decision making.  The disease takes many years to evolve. Diagnostic and treatment \napproaches are changing.  It is very important that future clinical decision makers and patients \nunderstand why a decision was made. \nThree problem cases were identified.  2 cases (L,W) were complex cases.  These patients should have had \nhepatology consultation. Case 0 had no apparent plan or documentation related to Hep C issues. \nThe panel is happy to meet to further discuss in general or specific cases. \nREVIEW TABLE \nCase =  Letter assigned by DOC to a chart \nSummary = Panel overall impression.  OK means that the overall care and decision making was acceptable. \nSuggestions however are made in several of these cases \n\nComments = most important factors in a case \nSuggestions = More detail regarding how care could be improved in a case or other issues of note \nCase  Summary  Comments  Suggestions \nA  OK  Genotype 3  Does not need biopsy given he is a 3. \nB  OK  Better documentation needed \nC  OK  Treated  Not clear why 2 year interval until treatment.
