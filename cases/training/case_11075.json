    "summary": "<p>This is a school and housing desegregation case in Yonkers, New York. The initial complaint was filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1980, and the Yonkers branch of the NAACP intervened in 1981 to make the case a class action. After 27 years, the parties settled in 2007, with Yonkers agreeing to build 800 units of public housing in predominantly-white East and Northwest Yonkers. This case was highly contentious: in the late 1980s, Yonkers defied the court’s desegregation orders, resulting in contempt fines that reached $1 million per day and brought Yonkers to the brink of bankruptcy. HBO dramatized this conflict in the 2015 series <a href=https://www.hbo.com/show-me-a-hero>Show Me a Hero</a>. </p><p><b>The Pretrial Phase (1980-1982)</b></p><p>In 1980, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division brought this case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of Yonkers, New York, alleging that the City had intentionally segregated its schools by deliberately concentrating public housing in Southwest Yonkers. Specifically, the complaint was brought to enforce Titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it alleged violations of Title VIII of the Fair Housing Act, the 14th Amendment, Department of Education regulations, and contractual assertions made by Yonkers to access federal educational funds. By preventing public housing from being built in majority-white neighborhoods, Yonkers officials had ensured that Yonkers schools were almost entirely segregated by race. According to the opinion available at 518 F. Supp. 181, the complaint also alleged that the City and the school board enabled segregation through racially discriminatory policies and through the repeated appointment of school board members who opposed integrating Yonkers schools. The complaint aimed to desegregate Yonkers schools by desegregating Yonkers housing - specifically, by requiring Yonkers to build public housing in majority-white neighborhoods. </p><p>The Yonkers branch of the NAACP intervened in 1981, on behalf of a child in the Yonkers public school system.  Thereafter, the school desegregation aspect of the case was certified as a class action, with the class defined as all black or Hispanic children attending a Yonkers public school. The housing desegregation aspect of the case was also certified as a class action, the class defined as any Yonkers resident eligible for or living in public housing in Yonkers. 518 F. Supp. 191.</p><p>Because of the divisiveness of the litigation and its potential cost, Judge Leonard B. Sand appointed a Special Master in September 1982 to help the parties negotiate a settlement to both the housing and schooling prongs of the case. </p><p>This case occurred in parallel with a case to desegregate the Yonkers Police Department. For more information about that case, see <i>United States v. City of Yonkers</i>, 609 F. Supp. 1281 (1984).</p><p><b>The Trial Phase (1983-1985)</b></p><p>From 1983 to 1984, Judge Sand held a 14-month trial to determine if the City and Board of Education had intentionally racially segregated housing and public school in Yonkers. 837 F.2d 1181; 624 F. Supp. 1276. </p><p>In March 1984 and with the help of the Special Master, the Yonkers NAACP and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) entered a consent decree regarding public housing certificates in East Yonkers. Specifically, the consent decree required HUD to make 175 Section 8 certificates available. Recipients of the certificates had 120 days to find housing in East Yonkers. If they could not find housing in East Yonkers within 120 days, the certificates could then be used for any housing in Yonkers.  HUD was also required to conduct and file quarterly reviews on the use of the certificates for the next two years and to report any complaints received from applicants. Finally, HUD was required to impose additional requirements on the Yonkers Metropolitan Housing Authority (MHA) - specifically, requiring the MHA to help applicants find housing in East Yonkers and to provide additional information to applicants about the nature of Section 8 housing certificates. 200 additional units were also made available under the consent decree. After HUD failed to take these required actions, the Yonkers NAACP filed a motion in December 1984 to compel compliance with the consent decree. 611 F. Supp. 730. </p><p>Also in March of 1984, the Special Master prepared a consent decree on the school segregation aspects of the case.  The proposed consent decree was approved by the Yonkers Board of Education (YBE), but was never implemented after the Yonkers City Council voted not to provide any financial resources to carry out its terms. 108 F.R.D. 199.</p><p>In June 1984, a local reporter filed an application to waive the ban on tape-recording trial proceedings, the denial of which was appealed to but ultimately affirmed by the Second Circuit. 587 F. Supp. 51; 747 F.2d 111. In September 1984, the City of Yonkers filed a counterclaim and a third party complaint against HUD, seeking contribution or indemnity for any remedy ordered by the court, both of which were dismissed. 594 F. Supp. 466.</p><p>On November 20, 1985, Judge Sand wrote a 278-page opinion finding that Yonkers had intentionally racially segregated public housing and public schools. The City was liable for the school segregation, despite the fact that the YBE was a state-created entity separate from the City, because of the Yonkers mayor’s discretionary appointments to the Board. On the housing issue, Judge Sand found that the segregative effect of the City’s actions was “remarkably consistent and extreme,” and that it was “highly unlikely” that the “pattern of subsidized housing that so perfectly preserved the overwhelmingly white character of East and Northwest Yonkers came about for reasons unrelated to race.” The court specifically referenced a pattern of community animosity to East Yonkers public housing construction leading to the withdrawal of such proposals as evidence of why segregation had persisted despite administration changes over time. On the school issue, Judge Sand held that similar “patterns of decisionmaking” in response to “racially influenced community opposition” led to intentional segregation by the YBE and, through housing and Board appointments, the City. 624 F. Supp. 1276.</p><p><b>Enforcing the Court’s Remedies (1985-1989)</b></p><p>In June 1985, HUD had not taken any action on Yonkers’ application for the Section 8 housing certificates required under the 1984 consent decree.  HUD contended that it was prevented from complying with the consent decree because of federal housing law and the City of Yonkers’ insufficient Housing Assistance Plan (HAP). Judge Sand found that the consent decree had not been presented to the court as being conditioned on the City’s HAP, but that HUD was, in fact, precluded from providing the Section 8 certificates by federal law. Despite this finding, the court admonished HUD for its inaction and set a schedule of seven required actions to be completed by October 1985. 611 F. Supp at 733.</p><p>In July 1985, the YBE demanded that its insurance provider reimburse it for about $3 million in legal fees from the trial, a request that was denied by the insurance company. The YBE successfully sued the insurance company for the defense costs. For more information on the insurance litigation, see <i>Board of Education v. CNA Ins. Co.</i>, 647 F. Supp. 1495 (1986). </p><p>On April 22, 1986, Judge Sand issued a proposed school desegregation order, which relied on voluntary magnet schools to integrate Yonkers schools. 1986 WL 4894. On May 13, 1986, Judge Sand ordered Yonkers to desegregate its public schools.  Specifically, the school district was required to establish magnet schools, enact a Voluntary Student Transfer program, and to create a human rights program. The school district was required to close eight schools. The school district was also directed to achieve 100% desegregation (defined as within 20% of the district wide average of minority students for that grade level) by the 1987-88 school year.  The City and the Community Development Agency were also barred from blocking or refusing to permit the construction of public housing in East Yonkers. 635 F. Supp. 1538. This plan was later called “Educational Improvement Plan I” (EIP I). After the remedy was entered, the City objected that the court’s plan was too expensive to implement and filed a motion to stay the plan. The desegregation plan was started during the 1986-87 school year over these objections. 837 F.2d 1181.</p><p>Two weeks later, Judge Sand entered another remedy order on the housing aspect of the case. The City was enjoined from blocking public housing construction in East and Northwest Yonkers or otherwise enabling residential segregation. It was also required to establish a Fair Housing Office that would issue semi-annual reports to the plaintiffs and was required to build two hundred additional units of public housing in predominately-white East and Northwest Yonkers. To comply, the City Council had to approve specific plans for 140 of the 200 additional units by July 1986 and the remaining 60 units by September 1986. The City also had to submit a new HAP that was compliant with HUD regulations and federal law. Judge Sand retained jurisdiction for five years, after which the City could move to dismiss the case. 635 F. Supp. 1577. </p><p>At the same time, Judge Sand issued an additional order, finding continuing racial segregation through May 28, 1986. This finding was based on the City’s failure to designate public housing sites in East Yonkers, submit a legally sufficient HAP to HUD, and to obtain Section 8 certificates from HUD. The court also found that Yonkers was able to take remedial steps under the court’s orders, but had not because of political paralysis - which could not be used as an excuse to not comply with the court’s orders. 1986 WL 6159.</p><p>In September 1986, several homeowners appealed the district court’s denial of their motion to intervene of right as defendants in the litigation. Each homeowner lived near a proposed public single-family housing construction site and opposed the construction. The Second Circuit affirmed Judge Sand’s denial of the motion as untimely, finding that the proposed intervenors should have filed their motion prior to the entry of the housing remedy order in May 1986. 801 F.2d 593.</p><p>In July 1987, the City Council submitted an alternative housing plan to the court for approval. 662 F. Supp. 1575. The Yonkers NAACP moved to order the YBE to release land adjacent to schools to help the City comply with the housing order. Judge Sand approved of using these sites, but allowed the City to continue developing its alternate plan. 675 F. Supp. 1407. The alternative plan was proposed to the court in 1992 (discussed below). </p><p>The Yonkers NAACP filed an amended complaint in September 1987 to include the State of New York and Urban Development Corporation as defendants, seeking State funding for the school desegregation order because of the City’s inability to adequately fund the desegregation project. 1989 WL 88698; 893 F.2d 498.</p><p>The City of Yonkers held an election in 1987. Twenty-eight year-old Nick Wasicsko, the eventual winner and youngest-ever mayor of Yonkers, promised to fight Judge Sand’s low income housing remedy by appealing to the 2nd Circuit. The 1987 mayoral race and Wasicsko’s mayoral term are the focus of the 2015 HBO series <a href=https://www.hbo.com/show-me-a-hero>Show Me a Hero</a>. </p><p>Also in November 1987, Judge Sand imposed a freeze on construction in East Yonkers. Specifically, any East Yonkers construction project that would require zoning changes or that would receive municipal tax breaks and that was to be built on land acceptable for public housing, was subject to the court's freeze and later review. 675 F. Supp. 1413.</p><p>The City Council appealed the court’s finding of intentional racial segregation and both of Judge Sand’s remedy orders to the 2nd Circuit. The Second Circuit affirmed the finding of intentional discrimination and both orders in all respects on December 28, 1987. Specifically, the Second Circuit held that the school remedy was appropriately district-wide and that it was not an abuse of the district court’s discretion to order the City to pay for the school desegregation plan, since the City was responsible for both funding the schools and the segregation of the schools in the first place. 837 F.2d 1181. </p><p>In January 1988, the City Council voted by 5-2 to a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice and Yonkers NAACP to specify seven sites for the 200 public housing units and to implement a plan to eventually build 800 units. Citing community opposition, the City later attempted to amend the consent decree, but its edits were refused by the district court on March 31, 1988. The City then refused to negotiate with the plaintiffs any further on the 800-unit long-term plan. On June 13, the district court ordered the City to enact a plan to build 800 public housing units long-term. After repeated refusals to comply with court orders, Judge Sand threatened to hold the City in contempt of court. 856 F.2d 444.</p><p>But on August 1, 1988, the City Council voted 4-3 to rescind its acceptance of the housing consent decree, triggering fines for contempt of court against both the City of Yonkers and the individual councilmembers who had voted against the consent decree. The City was fined $100 on the first day of noncompliance, with the fine doubled every day until the City complied. Each of the four council members who voted against the decree were to be fined $500 per day starting on August 2 and jailed starting on August 11 until they signaled willingness to implement the desegregation plan. Both prongs of the contempt charge were appealed to the 2nd Circuit, which lowered the amount of the fine against the City to $1 million per day after the 15th day of non-compliance but otherwise upheld the contempt sanctions. 856 F.2d at 450. The individual contempt sanctions were appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed the 2nd Circuit on a 5-4 vote and found that the individual council members could not be fined or jailed for contempt. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that the district court should have enforced sanctions against the City alone and only if those sanctions proved ineffective should the court have held individual council members in contempt. 493 U.S. 265. </p><p>On August 31, 1988, the Second Circuit upheld the district court’s orders to fund the construction of two new schools based on the Monitor’s second Report and Recommendation. 856 F.2d 7. </p><p>The fines against the City reached $1 million per day on September 9, 1988, and the City closed libraries, ceased garbage pickups, and prepared to <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/09/nyregion/threat-of-yonkers-layoffs-jolts-foes-of-housing-plan.html>lay off over 500 City employees</a>. Before the City was forced to declare bankruptcy, the Council reversed course and <a href=https://www.apnews.com/67ee1f4d5bb67e7a5f2fb2e8b7aa5caa>voted to approve the housing plan</a> by 5-2 at 1:30 am on September 10, 1988. In December 1988, the MHA issued a Request for Proposals to potential developers of public housing on five of the seven approved sites. 927 F.2d 85. </p><p>On September 19, 1989, Judge Sand denied a motion to intervene filed by members of the Yonkers Parks, Recreation, and Conservation Board so they could appeal the designation of some park land as a site for a new school. The Second Circuit affirmed the denial, holding that different parts of the City of Yonkers could not join the litigation separately to argue for different positions. 902 F.2d 213. </p><p><b>Continued Compliance (1990-2007)</b></p><p>In July and August 1990, Judge Sand ordered the City of Yonkers to transfer title to five public housing sites to developers so construction could begin. The City appealed these orders, arguing that fixing title issues impermissibly widened its scope of responsibility under the housing remedy order. The Second Circuit affirmed Judge Sand in all respects. 927 F.2d 85.</p><p>In 1991, the NAACP moved to require the City to adopt additional long-term housing measures after it became clear that the Long Term Plan Order of June 13, 1988 was inadequate. In response, the City filed a motion to vacate the 1988 consent decree and Order. 29 F.3d 40. On October 7, 1991, the City filed a motion for Judge Sand and the court’s housing advisor to recuse themselves after engaging in ex parte communications with plaintiffs’ counsel and third parties during the title transfer dispute and after commenting on the case to several publications. The Second Circuit found that the City had made its motion too late in the proceedings, and that recusal was not warranted because the communications related to existing court orders, not ongoing controversies before the court. 946 F.2d 180. </p><p>In 1992, the City proposed an alternative plan for public housing, which the district court determined would be inadequate to meet the City’s goals and unlikely to succeed because of the political discord and inefficient use of sites. Instead, the court entered a supplemental order, which aimed to utilize 250 existing units and created a Housing Special Master position. On July 5, 1994, the Second Circuit affirmed the supplemental order. 29 F.3d 40.</p><p>The State contested the YBE and NAACP’s assertion that State funds should be used to fund EIP I because further taxes on Yonkers residents would undermine the school desegregation program. The State argued that no “vestiges of segregation” persisted in the Yonkers school system, so additional funding was unnecessary. 1992 WL 176593. On August 30, 1993, after twelve days of trial on whether segregation persisted in Yonkers schools, Judge Sand determined that vestiges of segregation persisted and that the steps being taken by the City were inadequate to eliminate them. 833 F. Supp. 214. Judge Sand found that Yonkers chronically underfunded its schools because of persistent financial distress, and that even though the YBE superintendent enthusiastically embraced desegregation, segregation persisted. </p><p>On March 27, 1995, Judge Sand addressed the liability of the State for segregation in Yonkers public schools through 1985. The YBE and NAACP contended that the State was responsible for segregation in Yonkers because it failed to implement racial integration policies and because it participated in the development of Yonkers public housing. Judge Sand found that the State had adopted a passive attitude toward local segregation, but had not affirmatively participated in segregation in Yonkers. The court ultimately determined that there was no basis for State liability, despite criticizing the State’s arguments that it did not know of the segregation and was powerless to fix it. 880 F. Supp. 212. This judgment was vacated and remanded by the Second Circuit. 96 F.3d 600. </p><p>On remand in October 1997, Judge Sand found that the State was liable for the vestiges of segregation present in Yonkers schools and had to fund efforts to eliminate these vestiges. Judge Sand ordered the State to participate in the planning process for a further desegregation program, called Educational Improvement Plan II (EIP II). He also required an equal apportionment of costs between the State and City, finding equal fault for both. 984 F. Supp. 687. The State appealed this order, but did not seek a stay on EIP II, which was implemented in 1999. While the appeal was pending, in June 1998, Judge Sand determined that the City’s financial distress was such that the State would need to bear greater than 50% of costs of EIP I and II for several years, and directed the Special Monitor to create a financial plan to that effect. 7 F. Supp. 2d 396. </p><p>In December 1998, Judge Sand determined that the State’s housing authority was liable for enacting the Housing Remedy Order. Judge Sand found that the State’s Urban Development Corporation (UDC) had a legislative mandate to build low income housing in the State and was in the position to remedy the segregation of Yonkers public housing at all relevant times in the litigation. 30 F. Supp. 2d 650. </p><p>The Second Circuit reversed Judge Sand’s finding on the issue of vestiges in June 1999, holding that the criteria used were too vague and that “prior segregation, coupled with a finding of present day racial differences in educational achievement” is not enough to prove that a school system has vestiges of segregation. The Court of Appeals also rejected EIP II, finding it too broad because there were no specific findings of vestiges of segregation to remedy. Even so, the court upheld Judge Sand’s apportionment of costs between the City and State for EIP I. 181 F.3d 301. In November 1999, the Second Circuit reheard the appeal on whether vestiges of segregation - specifically, low teacher expectations for minority students and insufficiently multicultural teaching techniques and curriculum - continued to exist in Yonkers schools. The Court of Appeals reaffirmed its findings that the named vestiges were too vague to support the district court’s findings and EIP II remedy, but that half of EIP I costs were properly directed to the State. The court remanded the case to Judge Sand for further findings as to vestiges of segregation. 197 F.3d 41.</p><p>In November 2000, Judge Sand issued new findings on remaining vestiges of segregation in Yonkers schools and housing. Judge Sand found that the continuing gap in academic achievement between students of different races was due to the policies and practices in place at Yonkers schools. Specifically, minority students had been disproportionately enrolled in the least demanding academic programs, had been disproportionately involved in disciplinary matters, and had been disproportionately referred to special education programs. Judge Sand also found that the administrators of schools provided inadequate personnel services to students (for example, by not offering guidance counseling) and to students for whom English was not their first language. Judge Sand referred the case to the Special Monitor to recommend a remedy. 123 F. Supp. 2d 694. </p><p>In January 2001, the Second Circuit upheld the District Court’s modification of the Housing Remedy Order and allocation of “bonus points” to the City for speedy treatment of long-term public housing residents. Specifically, the City objected to the modification of the Order to condition the City’s credits toward compliance on the race of the family assisted and the racial makeup of the neighborhood in which they were housed. The Second Circuit found that, although this was a race-conscious remedy, it survived strict scrutiny because it was narrowly tailored to ensure the City’s compliance. The NAACP appealed the allocation of bonus credits for achieving certain targets in the Order, including quick placements of high priority families, but the Second Circuit upheld this modification as well. 239 F.3d 211. </p><p>In May 2001, the Second Circuit upheld Judge Sand’s orders on cost apportionment between the City and State. Specifically, the court found that there was no abuse of discretion in ruling that no partial credit for magnet school funding was available in continuing cost allocation, that no credit would be given for state aid grants, and that universal pre-K costs should be shifted to the 1986 Educational Improvement Plan (EIP I) after EIP II was vacated in the Second Circuit’s November 1999 decision. 251 F.3d 31. In 2002, the schooling portion of the case was <a href=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2007/May/07-crt-316.html>resolved</a>, and EIP I’s cost-sharing plan ended in 2006. 7 F. Supp. 2d 396.</p><p>In <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/nyregion/02yonkers/html>May 2007</a>, Judge Sand signed off on a settlement agreement between the Yonkers NAACP and the City. The <a href=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2010/12/15/yonkerssettle-2.pdf>settlement </a> requires Yonkers to maintain 800 units of housing (previously established as part of the 1988 Long Term Plan) for 30 years after the units become available. 425 units are resident-owned, while 315 units are rental housing units. The City is required to monitor the units to ensure continued affordability and desegregation compliance, and the Department of Justice and NAACP can sue for compliance. The terms of the settlement run through 2037. The case was dismissed with prejudice in July 2007, pursuant to the terms of the settlement, which remains in force. </p><p><b>Case Citations</b></p><p>518 F. Supp. 191</p><p>587 F.

    "summary_short": "In 1980, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of Yonkers, alleging intentional segregation of public housing and public schools. In 1981, the NAACP intervened and the class was certified as a class action. After a multi-year trial that started in 1983, Judge Leonard B. Sand found that Yonkers had intentionally segregated its public housing, concentrating all low income housing sites in Southwest Yonkers. He also found that the City and the Board of Education had intentionally segregated Yonkers public schools. Judge Sand required Yonkers to build public housing in predominantly-white East and Northwest Yonkers and to desegregate public schools.\r\n\r\nThe City strongly resisted Judge Sand’s remedy orders. The City was pushed to the edge of bankruptcy after it refused to comply with the housing order, incurring daily contempt fines that eventually rose to a total of $1 million per day. After preparing to lay off numerous employees and ceasing important City functions, the City finally voted to comply with the housing order in 1988. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, public housing construction projects began in East and Northwest Yonkers. The City, not wanting to raise taxes on Yonkers residents to fund the housing and school desegregation remedies, sought contribution from the State of New York. In 1993, Judge Sand found that “vestiges of segregation” persisted in Yonkers public schools, and required further remediation by the City. Judge Sand found in 1995 that the State was also liable for the segregation in Yonkers and required an even split of costs between the State and City for school desegregation. Litigation on the question of vestiges and on cost-splitting between the City and State continued until 2001, when the Second Circuit approved of Judge Sand’s cost apportionment for the school desegregation remedy. The schooling prong of the case was resolved in 2002. In 2007, the NAACP, Justice Department, and City of Yonkers settled the housing prong of the case. The City agreed to build 800 total units of long-term public housing in East and Northwest Yonkers and the Justice Department and NAACP may sue for compliance if affordability and desegregation standards are breached.\r\n",

See note 3, supra. \n   \n5  The City asserts a similar claim as a ground for dismissing plaintiff’s Title IV claim, contained in paragraph 19 of the \n  complaint: \n“the complaint’s allegations fail as a matter of law to allege sufficient control over management of educational \naffairs by the City to satisfy Title VI. The complaint only alleges control over budgetary matters; it fails to allege \nany City control over educational affairs, student assignment, or school administration. Control over the budget, \nwithout more, is insufficient. The Board of Education is a separate and autonomous entity under New York law, \nand is subject as a matter of state law, to the control of the New York State Board of Regents, and not the City.

Whether or not the defendant City \nexercises such control over the School Board so that it may be liable for the actions of that body, or be subject to \nthis suit because of actions taken or omitted by the Board, presents a factual question with respect to the extent of \ncontrol over the Board which cannot be resolved by the motion to dismiss. This motion is denied. \n \n6  The defendants’ motion was brought prior to the motion to intervene. At page 9 of the Memorandum of the City \n  and CDA, it was stated: “No member of the public, however, has joined or intervened in this suit as a private plaintiff \nseeking to enforce his own constitutional or statutory rights.” The School Board joined in this motion, also prior to \nthe filing of the motion to intervene. \n \n7  Rule 24(b) provides in relevant part: \n \n“Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: ... (2) when an \napplicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.... \nIn exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay \nor prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.” \n \n8  United States Postal Service v.

Button, 371 U.S. 415, 443, 83 S.Ct. 328, 343, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). We also note that the NAACP has represented \nplaintiffs in numerous desegregation suits. See cases cited in Applicant’s Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene at 4 \nn.2. \n \n12  Adequacy of representation by the United States, although one factor to be considered, United States Postal Service \n  v. Brennan, supra, 479 F.2d at 191, is, in this context, “a minor factor.” United States v. Columbia Pictures, supra, 88 \nF.R.D. at 189 (footnote omitted). In any event, we agree with the Government’s assertion that the intervenors’ \n“perspective, ideas, experience could only add as to resolution of this matter.” Tr. of Argument, April 28, 1981 at 17, \nand conclude that representation of intervenors’ perspective by their own counsel is appropriate. \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Ed., 518 F.Supp. 191 (1981)   \n33 Fed.R.Serv.2d 121 \n \n \n13  “This argument is meritless. The proper inquiry is whether intervention would prejudice the rights of existing \n  parties, not whether a denial of intervention would prejudice the proposed intervenor.” Weisman v. Darneille, 89 \nF.R.D.  47,  52  (S.D.N.Y.1980).  Moreover,  commencement  of  a  separate  action  which  would  most  likely  be \nconsolidated with this action would not promote judicial economy. \n \n14  The intervenors have stated their intention to file a separate action if their application is denied. Were such a \n  proceeding to be filed in this Court, it would, under the rules applicable to all actions filed here, be treated as a case \nrelated to the instant proceeding and in all likelihood would be consolidated with this proceeding. In response to \nthis observation, the defendants contend that there would be a difference between a consolidation of two related \nactions, and intervention in a single proceeding. Whatever difference there may be, and whatever arguments could \nbe made or availed of in one circumstance, but not the other, are not pinpointed with any precision. In any event, \nany differences between the parties and their respective rights will be noted by the Court when appropriate. In \neffect, granting intervenors’ application merely eliminates the consolidation process. \nWe also note that intervention in this case is not comparable to intervention in an SEC injunctive proceeding by \nprivate class action plaintiffs who seek damages. See SEC v. Everest Management Corp., 475 F.2d 1236, 1240 (2d Cir. \n1972) (affirming exercise of district court’s “broad discretion” to deny intervention which would have an adverse \neffect on SEC enforcement) (noting that intervention by private party in SEC enforcement action might be \nappropriate in a different case). See also Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Carter, Rogers and Whitehead \n& Co., 497 F.Supp. 450, 453 (E.D.N.Y.1980). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The portion of the letter relating to the Section 8 Certificates is reproduced \nin full below. \nWith respect to the Section 8 program, HUD will accept an application by your Authority to administer a \nSection 8 Existing Housing Program in the City of Yonkers for 175 2–BR family units. (Attachment 4) \nYour application must be submitted in accordance with the attached Consent Decree. Please ensure that all \nrequirements as noted in said Decree are complied with in filing this application. \nShould there by any questions respecting the Section 8 Existing application, please contact Teresa Bainton at \n(212) 264–0808. \nPursuant to paragraph 15 of the attached Consent Decree, you are advised that the Department expects your \nAuthority to make all diligent efforts to assist eligible families for Section 8 Existing housing to find such housing \neast of the Saw Mill River Parkway. Further we require your Authority to inform eligible applicants as to the \nnature of the 175 units, as well as to provide these applicants with the name of the HUD contact person to \nwhom any applicants may complain concerning lack of cooperation by your Authority in assisting applicants in \nusing these Certificates. \nThe contact person for such problems is: \nMary Haight \nOffice of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity \n26 Federal Plaza, Room 3532 \nNew York, New York 10278 \n(212) 264–8034 \nId. A copy of the letter was sent to counsel for plaintiff-intervenors. \n \n4  As noted earlier, Plaintiff-intervenors’ motion concerned the 200 public housing units to be provided under the \n  Decree as well as the 175 Section 8 Certificates. Oral argument concerning both was heard on December 27, 1984, \nand HUD was ordered to take certain steps with respect to the pending application for the 200 public housing units. \nAt a subsequent status conference on April 9, 1985, the Consent Decree parties agreed that the Section 8 \nCertificates presented an entirely separate issue, and that it would be appropriate for the Court to rule on that issue \nbefore final resolution of the dispute with respect to the public housing units. \n \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 611 F.Supp. 730 (1985)   \n \n \n5  The three-year HAP goals for families in the City’s current HAP total 140 units. HUD has allocated all of those units \n  toward the MHA’s pending application for the 200 public housing units made available under the Decree. See HUD \nMem. of Dec. 21, 1984, at p. 10, n. 5. Plaintiff-intervenors have not contested the propriety of this allocation, and \nthis Opinion assumes that the allocation is in fact proper. \n \n6  At oral argument on Plaintiff-intervenor’s motion, HUD suggested that no provisions were made because none were \n  possible. See Transcript at p. 20. As will become evident later in the Opinion, there is a great deal that could have \nbeen provided for. Indeed some of the provisions that could have been made (had they been thought necessary) are \nidentical to those that were made with respect to the 200 units of public housing made available under the Consent \nDecree. See, e.g., Consent Decree, paragraph (7) & (8). \nMoreover, it is simply absurd to suggest that the parties would make careful and detailed provision for the \nadministration and monitoring of the Certificates, see Consent Decree paragraphs (12)–(15), but intentionally \nleave unaddressed issues affecting whether the Certificates would be awarded at all. \n \n7  See, supra, note 3. \n   \n8  The statute provides that the “unit of general local government” is to be notified of HUD’s receipt of a housing \n  assistance application and given an opportunity to object to its approval on grounds of inconsistency with the area’s \ncurrent HAP. 42 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(1). If such an objection is received, the Secretary “may not approve the application \nunless he determines that the application is consistent with” the HAP. Id. at § 1439(a)(2). If no such objection is \nreceived, the Secretary “may approve the application unless he finds it inconsistent with” the HAP. Id. at § \n1439(a)(3). \n \n9  See, supra, note 5. \n   \n10  HUD’s memorandum is considerably less forthright. It contends that HUD cannot be required to violate a statute or \n  its own regulations, and describes at length a case which held that HUD had no authority to waive a HAP’s \nproportionality requirement. HUD Mem. of Dec. 21, 1984, at pp. 7–9 (citing Lower Moreland Homeowner’s Ass’n v. \nHUD, 479 F.Supp. 886 (E.D.Pa.1979). No mention was made of HUD’s prior invocation of its waiver authority in \nurging that the Decree be approved, nor of its prior dismissal of Lower Moreland as being no impediment to the \nimplementation of the Decree on the ground (among others) that the case did not discuss the specific grant of \nwaiver authority contained in the regulations. See HUD Reply Mem. of March 1, 1984 at pp. 14, 17. \n \n11  As noted earlier, this conclusion assumes the propriety of allocating the City’s entire three-year goal for families to \n  the public housing units made available by the Consent Decree but as yet unapproved. See, supra, note 3. \nThe conclusion also assumes, as the parties have, that the City in fact has an approved HAP currently in effect. \nThere would appear to be occasion to question that assumption, however, since it is the Court’s understanding \nthat the City has yet to submit its annual HAP for the current year. \n \n12  As we have already indicated, the Consent Decree does not make the existence of a suitable HAP a condition \n  precedent to HUD’s duty to provide the Section 8 Certificates. Thus, HUD had no right to wait idly for that \noccurrence. Nor was it enough for HUD to make a token effort to overcome the obstacle presented by the City’s \ncurrent HAP.

Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a third-party complaint may be \n“served upon a person not a party to the action.” Because of the relationship between HUD and the United States, \nthe impleader action may be tantamount to an attempt to implead the plaintiff, a basis for dismissal of a third-party \ncomplaint. See, e.g., Henz v. Superior Trucking Co., Inc., 96 F.R.D. 219 (M.D.Pa.1982). \nWe note, however, that there are occasions upon which a federal agency may be deemed an entity separate from \nthe United States, for purposes of determining whether a justiciable controversy exists. See United States v. \nNixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3100, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974); United States v. I.C.C., 337 U.S. 426, \n430–31, 69 S.Ct. 1410, 1413–14, 93 L.Ed. 1451 (1949). If the interests represented by HUD and the United States \nas plaintiff in this action are sufficiently different as to raise a potentially justiciable controversy between them, \nwe believe that the impleader action would be proper a fortiori. In any event, since resolution of this question is \nnot necessary to our disposition of this motion, we merely note the issue without deciding it. \n \n2  The statute provides: \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 594 F.Supp. 466 (1984)   \n \n \n  An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an \nagency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal \nauthority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States ... \nThe United States may be named as a defendant in any such action, and a judgment or decree may be entered \nagainst the United States .... \n5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added) (1982). \n \n3  The Jaffee case involved claims against the government brought by soldiers exposed to nuclear testing. The court \n  held that their claim for the provision of medical services was barred by sovereign immunity since it could be \nsatisfied, in the alternative, by the payment of money to compensate future medical expenses. 592 F.2d at 715. \nHowever, a petition that the government “warn members of a class about medical risks” was not subject to \ndismissal on this ground. Although the court acknowledged that this relief might impose an expense upon the \ngovernment, it held that it could not be satisfied by the payment of money. \n \n4  Contrast this claim with the complaint in Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976) where \n  the plaintiffs sought to enjoin HUD from providing funds to housing projects that would allegedly have been \nadministered in a discriminatory manner. 425 U.S. at 287 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. at 1541 n. 2. There is, of course, a significant \ndistinction between a claim seeking to require the payment of money and a claim seeking to enjoin future funding to \nprevent future harm. \n \n5  The analysis of the waiver provisions of § 1404a is substantially the same and does not require a separate \n  discussion. See Little Earth of United Tribes, Inc. v. HUD, 584 F.Supp. 1292, 1300 (D.Minn.1983). \n \n6  HUD’s liability for monetary damages, however, was limited under the Burr analysis to “those funds which have \n  been paid over to [HUD] in accordance with [the National Housing Act] and which are in its possession, severed from \nTreasury funds and Treasury control ....” Burr, supra, 309 U.S. at 250, 60 S.Ct. at 493. \n \n7  As explanation for its decision, the Lynn court merely noted that no violations of the National Housing Act had been \n  alleged. See 523 F.Supp. at 783. The Unimex court was similarly terse; it, too, noted that no express or implied \nviolation of the Housing Act had been alleged, and, citing Burr, that the waiver provision of § 1702 was therefore \ninapplicable. See 594 F.2d at 1061. Only the Little Earth court addressed the issues raised at any length. In holding § \n1702 to be inapplicable to civil rights actions, the court noted the dearth of support for a holding to the contrary and \nthe incompatibility of such a holding both with Burr ‘s commercial obligation rationale and with its rule of limited \nliability. See 584 F.Supp. at 1299–1300. \n \n8  The Baker court also neglected to explain how the plaintiff’s claims could, as required under Burr, be satisfied from a \n  specific fund committed to the Secretary’s control pursuant to the National Housing Act. These puzzling omissions \nmay be attributable to the apparent “shortcomings in the briefs” submitted to the Baker court. See FDIC v. Citizens \nBank & Trust Co., 592 F.2d 364, 371 (7th Cir.1979) (discussing a different aspect of the Baker decision). In any event, \nthe Seventh Circuit has subsequently overruled two aspects of the Baker decision, see FDIC v. Citizens Bank & Trust \nCo., supra, at 370–71, and Beard v. Robinson, 563 F.2d 331, 336 (7th Cir.1977), and has not yet had occasion to rule \nagain on the aspect that is relevant to this case. Given these various considerations, we do not regard Baker as \ncarrying significant persuasive force. \n \n9  The cases involved, respectively, a claim that HUD had violated state law in failing to pay interest on the security \n  deposits of tenants in federally-owned housing projects, and alleged violations of local building ordinances by HUD \nin connection with the maintenance of HUD-owned property. Both courts adverted to the commercial nature of the \nobligations sought to be enforced. Merrill, 638 F.2d at 1090; Burroughs, 564 F.Supp. at 1018. \nThe City cites no cases that have held § 1702 to be applicable to civil rights actions against HUD. As noted above, \nwe are aware of only one case to so hold, and for reasons already discussed, we find that decision to be \nunpersuasive. \nIt has been suggested by the litigants in another case that the results in Lopez v. Arraras, 606 F.2d 347 (1st \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 594 F.Supp. 466 (1984)   \n \n \nCir.1979) and Abrams v. Hills, 547 F.2d 1062 (9th Cir.1976) provide support for a holding that the “sue and be \nsued” clauses apply to civil rights actions. See Little Earth, supra, 584 F.Supp. at 1299–1300. We disagree. The \nLopez case involved a suit by tenants in a federally-funded low-income housing project against various officials of \nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for failure to comply with the maximum rent guidelines of the National \nHousing Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1437a(1). The asserted bases of liability of the Puerto Rican officials were 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1983, 1985(3), and the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments. The court held that § 1404a waived sovereign \nimmunity so that HUD could be joined as a party to the action. 606 F.2d at 353. However, the potential basis for \nHUD’s liability in Lopez arose not under the civil rights laws, but rather under the National Housing Act itself, \nwhich directly imposed upon HUD the duties it was charged with breaching. The claims against HUD were \ntherefore directly covered by the sovereign immunity waiver of § 1404a. Abrams involved a claim that the \nSecretary of HUD had failed to implement a certain “operating subsidy” program for federally-financed housing as \nrequired by the National Housing Act. The case had nothing to do with HUD’s liability under the civil rights laws or \nany other statute besides the National Housing Act itself. \n \n10  The same is true of § 1404a. While the words may bear the interpretation urged by the City, the context in which \n  the words were enacted belies it. Cf. Sigona v. Slusser, 124 F.Supp. 327, 329 (D.Conn.1954) (analysis of Burr with \nrespect to the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 1702 is applicable to 42 U.S.C. § 1404a as well). \n \n11  The section provides that: \n  Any department or agency action taken pursuant to section 2000d–1 of this title shall be subject to such judicial \nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by such department or agency on other \ngrounds. In the case of action, not otherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or refusing to grant or to \ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed pursuant to \nsection 2000d–1 of this title, any person aggrieved (including any State or political subdivision thereof and any \nagency of either) may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5, and such \naction shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of that chapter. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d–2. Both title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 are \ncovered by this provision. See Jones v. Tully, 378 F.Supp. 286, 291–93 (S.D.N.Y.1974), aff’d w/o op., 510 F.2d 961 \n(2d Cir.1975). \n \n12  See, e.g., Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976); Clients’ Council v. Pierce, 711 F.2d \n  1406 (8th Cir.1983); Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236 (6th Cir.1974); Shannon v. HUD, 436 F.2d 809 (3d \nCir.1970); NAACP v. Harris, 567 F.Supp. 637 (D.Mass.1983); Williamsburg Fair Housing Comm. v. NYCHA, 73 F.R.D. \n381 (S.D.N.Y.1976). \n \n13  HUD’s limited liability under § 1702 further increases the improbability that the section was intended to apply to \n  civil rights actions. Limiting HUD’s liability to funds within the control of the Secretary makes sense when applied to \nHUD’s commercial activities. It is in keeping with the intent identified in Burr to subject HUD (but not the United \nStates generally) to liability to the same extent that a private enterprise would be liable under like circumstances. \nThe limitation makes no sense as applied to civil rights actions. Since the duties in question are, as already noted, \nsovereign in nature, it seems unlikely that Congress would choose to waive immunity on behalf of the Secretary of \nHUD but not the United States generally. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine why Congress would waive sovereign \nimmunity for damage actions based upon the civil rights laws but have recovery depend upon whether the \nSecretary of HUD had funds within its control sufficient to cover the claim. \n \n14  Compare, e.g., Little Earth, supra, at 584 F.Supp. 1299 (waivers of sovereign immunity should be strictly construed) \n  with S.S. Silberblatt, supra, at 608 F.2d 35–36 (waivers of sovereign immunity should be liberally construed). See also \nModular Technics Corp. v. South Haven Houses, 403 F.Supp. 204, 205 (E.D.N.Y.1975) (noting the confusion and \nsuggesting that the authority for liberal construction relates only to “procedural” matters), aff’d w/o op., 538 F.2d \n311 (2d Cir.1976). \n \n15  In this section, we need consider defendants’ claims only insofar as they seek monetary damages under the \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 594 F.Supp. 466 (1984)   \n \n \n  doctrines of contribution or indemnity. For the reasons already stated in the discussion of sovereign immunity, the \ndefendants’ claims against the United States cannot properly be characterized as claims for recoupment. \nIn discussing contribution and indemnity together, we do not mean to blur the distinction between these \nconcepts. See Prosser, The Law of Torts §§ 50, 51 (1971). However, the issue before us is only our power to \nrecognize the City’s claims, and in this respect, we do not believe that the distinctions between contribution and \nindemnity are relevant. See Anderson v. Local No. 3, 582 F.Supp. 627, 633 (S.D.N.Y.1984). \n \n16  In referring to cases involving “the rights and obligations of the United States,” the Court gave as examples United \n  States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., Inc., 412 U.S. 580, 93 S.Ct. 2389, 37 L.Ed.2d 187 (1973) (action by United States \nto quiet title in land) and Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943) (action \nby United States involving commercial paper that it issued). 451 U.S. at 641 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. at 2067 n. 12. Obviously, \nthese cases have nothing to do with the questions before this Court. \n \n17  To the extent that the City’s damage claims are predicated upon a constitutional tort theory, see Bivens v. Six \n  Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) and Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 99 \nS.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979), they are also barred by sovereign immunity. Bivens authorizes suits against \nfederal officials in their personal capacities, not against the government or its agencies. E.g., Bartel v. F.A.A., 725 \nF.2d 1403, 1414 n. 20 (D.C.Cir.1984); Keene Corp. v. United States, 700 F.2d 836, 845 n. 13 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 \nU.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983); Ross v. United States, 574 F.Supp. 536, 540 (S.D.N.Y.1983). \n \n18  The City has cited the case of Hart v. Community School Bd. of Brooklyn, 383 F.Supp. 699, 749–54 (E.D.N.Y.1974), \n  aff’d,  512  F.2d  37  (2d  Cir.1975)  in  which  Judge  Weinstein  directed  that  HUD  remain  a  party  to  a  school \ndesegregation case, although finding that a third-party claim against it had been “mooted.” While we can appreciate \nthe concerns that motivated Judge Weinstein, we are also aware that, on appeal, the Second Circuit indicated its \ndisapproval of the practice, and suggested very strongly that it would have reversed on this question had HUD and \nother third-party defendants appealed, writing: \nRather  than  reverse  the  retention  of  jurisdiction  over  the  third-party  defendants  in  the  absence  of  a \ncross-appeal seeking such relief, however, we recommend to the District Court that it withdraw its decision to \n“moot” the third-party action and dismiss it. \n512 F.2d at 56. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

As the Solicitor General emphasized at \noral argument, neither those sections of the decree nor Part IV of the remedy order is at issue in this action. \n \n2  The full text of § 17 provides that “[t]he City agrees to adopt, among other things, legislation (a) conditioning the \n  construction of all multifamily housing (inclusive of projects for future construction currently in the planning stage \nbut which will require zoning changes, variances, special exceptions, or other discretionary approvals from the City \nto begin construction) on the inclusion of at least 20 percent assisted units; (b) granting necessary tax abatements to \nhousing developments constructed under the terms of the legislation referred to in clause (a); (c) granting density \nbonuses to such developers; (d) providing for zoning changes to allow the placement of such developments, \nprovided, however, that such changes are not substantially inconsistent with the character of the area; and (e) other \nprovisions upon which the parties may subsequently agree (including the use of the Industrial Development \nAuthority as a development vehicle and the creation of a municipally-designated, independent not-for-profit Local \n \n\nSpallone v.

The City agrees to implement a package of \nMandated Incentives as promptly as practicable but, in no event, later than 90 days after the entry of this decree.” \n \n3  The Government’s statement to the contrary in its brief, Brief for United States 23–24, is in error. \n   \n4  The Government distinguishes the instant sanctions from those threatened in January 1988, because in this \n  litigation the city and the city council had indicated by the defeat of a resolution proposed by the court that it \n“would not ‘voluntarily adopt the legislation contemplated by the [court’s orders].’ ” Id., at 45 (quoting City of \nYonkers Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Proposed Contempt Order; see App. 351). Before the court \nthreatened sanctions for refusal to adopt the 1987–1988 HAP, however, the city council had twice tabled an \ninitiative to enact the HAP, id., at 173, and the court previously had been forced to “deem” HAP’s to have been \nsubmitted for two previous years. Id., at 174; Brief for United States 5, n. 7. Suffice it to say that the council’s \nconduct with regard to the HAP hardly suggested a willingness to comply “voluntarily.” \n \n1  According to the 1980 census, only 6% of the residents outside of southwest Yonkers were minorities, and they \n  were largely concentrated in two small neighborhoods. One northwest neighborhood had a minority population of \n29% and abutted a southwest tract comprised of over 50% minorities. The second neighborhood, located in east \nYonkers, was Runyon Heights. This neighborhood was founded early in this century on a large tract of land by a state \nsenator who regularly brought busloads of blacks from Harlem for picnics at which he auctioned off parcels of land \nto them. Runyon Heights is bounded to the north by a white neighborhood called Homefield. The original deeds for \nmany Homefield properties contained restrictive covenants prohibiting the sale of such properties to minorities, and \nas Runyon Heights developed, the Homefield Neighborhood Association purchased and maintained a 4–foot strip of \nland as a barrier between the streets of the two neighborhoods. Most Runyon Heights streets terminate in a dead \nend just below this strip, essentially sealing off the minority community from the surrounding white neighborhood. \nOne of the only two low-income housing developments located outside of southwest Yonkers was placed in \nRunyon Heights. The other housed only senior citizens, predominantly whites. \n \n2  The vote was 5 to 1; all four petitioners were in the majority. \n   \n3  While this vote terminated the contempt sanctions, it by no means heralded a lasting commitment on the part of \n  the  city  council  actually  to  follow  through  on  the  remedial  obligations  imposed  by  the  Affordable  Housing \nOrdinance. Since this date, no new public housing has been built in Yonkers. During the local city council election \nlast November, petitioner Spallone “campaigned [for Mayor] on a pledge to continue the city’s resistance to a \nFederal desegregation order requiring it to build low-income housing in white neighborhoods,” N.Y. Times, Nov. 8, \n1989, p. B1, col. 5, and Spallone was elected in a “race [that] was widely seen as a referendum on the housing \ndesegregation plan.” Ibid. Petitioners Chema and Fagan were reelected to the council, and the new member filling \nSpallone’s vacated seat also opposes compliance; thus “candidates opposed to the housing plan appea[r] to hold a \nmajority.” Ibid. Whether Yonkers officials will ever comply with Judge Sand’s orders attempting to remedy Yonkers’ \nlongstanding racial segregation remains an open question. \n \n4  See also, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 486, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 3055, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (Powell, \n  J., concurring) (District Court, “having had the parties before it over a period of time, was in the best position to \njudge whether an alternative remedy ... would have been effective in ending petitioners’ discriminatory practices”); \nFullilove v.

I agree \nwith the Court that, given city council approval of the city’s Consent Decree committing itself to pass legislation \nimplementing the Housing Remedy Order, Judge Sand did not abuse his discretion by binding the city to its own \ncommitment. Ante, at 632. Moreover, the city repeatedly objected to creation of an independent affordable \nhousing commission, and because this remedy would have completely divested the council of all legislative power in \nthe housing field, it is difficult to characterize it as a less intrusive means of remedying the discrimination. Finally, \n“deeming” the Affordable Housing Ordinance to have been passed likely would have been less effective in the long \nrun. Judge Sand would have still faced a continuing compliance battle with the city council; as he observed, \n“[o]bviously, if the city council were to say, well, Judge Sand, those are your orders [“deeming” the Ordinance \nenacted], you do with them what you will but at some point we will reassert our authority, then we are engaged in \nan exercise which doesn’t get housing built.” App. 357. Moreover, private developers would have been less likely to \ncommit resources to the subsidized housing program absent an assurance of ongoing council support for the \nprogram evidenced by council resolution. \n \n6  Memorandum filed with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit six days after Judge Sand held the city and \n  petitioners in contempt. \n \n7  The same clear warning was provided to the Second Circuit. At its hearing on the city’s stay application pending \n  appeal, the court inquired whether the attorney had changed his mind and now had reason to believe that the \nthreat of the accrued fines payable on August 15 would coerce compliance. The attorney replied as follows: \n“No, I think that would be playing Russian roulette on the city’s behalf. I couldn’t in good \nconscience suggest this. I suggested it at the time because I hoped that because several \ncouncil members had suggested that their concern was that they could not vote the zoning \nordinance into effect without the prior notice and public hearing, that if we allowed them to \nvote on August 15th, that would get rid of that excuse. But I have no reasonable belief that \ncouncil members would change their vote.” Tr. 13 (Aug. 9, 1988) (emphasis added). \n \n8  Cf. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 503, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1954, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969) (“[T]he legislative immunity \n  created by the Speech or Debate Clause ... insures that legislators are free to represent the interests of their \nconstituents without fear that they will be later called to task in the courts for that representation”). \n \n9  I do not mean to suggest that public policy concerns may play no role in designing the scope or content of the \n  underlying remedial order. When each of a variety of different remedial programs would fully remedy the \nconstitutional violation, for example, a district court should take into account relevant and important policy \nconcerns voiced by government defendants in choosing among such remedies. Here, “[a]t every step of the \nproceedings, the [district] court has stayed its hand to enable the elected representatives of Yonkers to have the \nmaximum input in shaping the destiny of Yonkers.” App. 205. \n \n10  See, e.g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 681, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2031, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 \n  (1978) (observing historical practice of district courts’ “ordering that taxes be levied and collected [by municipalities] \nto discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found”); Griffin v. Prince Edward County \nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218, 233, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 1234, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964) (district court could “require the \n[County] Supervisors to exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate, \nand maintain without racial discrimination a public school system ...”); cf. Watson v. Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 537, 83 \nS.Ct. 1314, 1320, 10 L.Ed.2d 529 (1963) (“[I]t is obvious that vindication of conceded constitutional rights cannot be \nmade dependent upon any theory that it is less expensive to deny than to afford them”). \n \n\nSpallone v. U.S., 493 U.S. 265 (1990)   \n110 S.Ct. 625, 107 L.Ed.2d 644, 58 USLW 4103 \n \n \n11  See Columbus Bd. of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 459, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 2947, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979) (once court \n  orders desegregation remedy, “[e]ach instance of a failure or refusal to fulfill this affirmative duty continues the \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment”). Put another way, remedial defiance by the legislature circumvents the \nstructural protections afforded the citizenry from unconstitutional government behavior by a multibranch review \nprocess, see supra, at 644, by allowing the legislature de facto to override the court’s ruling in a particular case that \nits behavior violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 18, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 1409, 3 L.Ed.2d 5 \n(1958) (“ ‘If the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, \nand destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery’ ”) \n(quoting United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115, 136, 3 L.Ed. 53 (1809)). \nIndeed, even were the councilmembers to maintain that the Affordable Housing Ordinance they were required to \nenact itself violated the Constitution, for example, by mandating unjustified racial preferences, the members \nwould nevertheless be bound by a court order considering yet rejecting their constitutional objection. See Cooper, \nsupra, 358 U.S., at 18, 78 S.Ct., at 1409 (“[F]ederal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the \nConstitution”  in  case  adjudication).  But  in  any  event,  the  councilmembers  raised  no  serious  substantive \nobjections, constitutional or otherwise, to the ordinance (which after all was based on the city council-approved \nConsent Decree). See, e.g., App. 416 (“The City of Yonkers through its council has represented to this court that \nthere are no substantive objections to the affordable housing ordinance”). \n \n12  Petitioner Chema claims that his legislative discretion is protected by the First Amendment as well. Characterizing \n  his vote on proposed legislation as core political speech, he contends that the Order infringes his right to \ncommunicate with his constituents through his vote. This attempt to recharacterize the common-law legislative \nimmunity doctrine into traditional First Amendment terms is unpersuasive. While the act of publicly voting on \nlegislation arguably contains a communicative element, the act is quintessentially one of governance; voting to \nimplement a remedial decree is best understood as a ministerial step in the process of executing a decision made by \ngovernment actors with superior authority. Councilmember Chema can no more claim immunity from sanctions for \nrefusing to comply with the District Court’s binding order by virtue of the First Amendment than could a Yonkers \nhousing official refuse to issue private developers written exemptions from zoning restrictions as required by the \nHousing Ordinance, or indeed than could Judge Sand on remand refuse to issue an order implementing the Court’s \ndecision in this case should he disagree with it. \n \n13  To be sure, imposing sanctions against the city allowed councilmembers to comply with the court order while \n  publicly explaining that their decision to do so was motivated by a desire to promote their constituents’ overall \ninterests (even though, as explained above, compliance was mandatory and therefore this appearance of deference \nto  constituent  pressure  was  merely  a  charade).  But any  suggestion  that  city  sanctions  were  somehow  less \n“perverse” than personal sanctions because the former allowed councilmembers more easily to cling to their \nself-defined political martyrdom is untenable; it seems absurd to suggest that Judge Sand ought to have been \nconcerned with providing the councilmembers guilty of unconscionable behavior a handy public excuse for their \nbelated  compliance.  Of  course,  providing  the  recalcitrant  councilmembers  with  a  public-oriented  excuse  for \ncompliance  probably  increased  the  likelihood  of  successful  coercion.  But  at  most  this  insight  suggests  that \nsanctioning the individual councilmembers alone might not have succeeded; it does not fault Judge Sand’s decision \nto impose both sanctions simultaneously, and it hardly renders his action an abuse of discretion. \n \n14  The Court repeatedly points out that the individual legislators were not parties to the original action. Ante, at 631, \n  632. This accurate observation explains why the lawsuit did not itself contravene the principle underlying the \ndoctrine of legislative immunity. See supra, at 645; cf. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S., at 505, 89 S.Ct., at 1955 \n(“Freedom of legislative activity ... [is] fully protected if legislators are relieved of the burden of defending \nthemselves”). \nIt is unclear, however, why the Court repeatedly insists that the individual city councilmembers were not \nspecifically enjoined by the Housing Remedy Order to participate in the remedial process. Ante, at 631, 633. As a \nfactual proposition, this insistence is misguided. First, the opening proviso of the Housing Remedy Order, which \nbinds the “City of Yonkers, its officers, agents, employees, successors, and all persons in active concert or \n \n\nSpallone v. U.S., 493 U.S. 265 (1990)   \n110 S.Ct. 625, 107 L.Ed.2d 644, 58 USLW 4103 \n \nparticipation with any of them” to refrain from future discriminatory acts, can easily be understood to refer \nequally to all substantive provisions of the Order. Second, the Consent Decree, specifically approved by the city \ncouncil, contemplated that the city would “adopt legislation”; this Decree was universally understood to impose \nduties directly upon the councilmembers, the only city officials with authority to adopt legislation. Third, the \nremedial duties were, by operation of law, “binding ... upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, \nservants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who \nreceive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.” Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 65(d). \nBut even assuming, arguendo, that the individual city councilmembers were not named parties in the original \nHousing Remedy Order, this fact would not preclude a finding of personal contempt given the clear notice \nafforded by the Contempt Order, and the Court nowhere explains how this fact could make resort to personal \nsanctions more “intrusive” than resort to city sanctions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

However, any claims against the UDC \n880 F.Supp. 212, 99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \nand  its  present  director  are  barred  by  the  statute  of \nlimitations. Moreover, the actions of the UDC cannot be   \nimputed  to  the  State  or  to  State  education  officials. \nFootnotes \n \n1  The YBE and NAACP introduced testimony of 31 witnesses and deponents and approximately 200 exhibits as well as \n  three sets of admissions dealing with undisputed issues. The State also called several witnesses and introduced \nsubstantial documentation. \n \n2  In our vestiges opinion, we relied upon a comparison of achievement scores of minority and majority students \n  within the Yonkers school district in concluding that minority students in Yonkers were not being afforded equal \neducational opportunities. Thus, the issue which is arguably before the United States Supreme Court in Missouri v. \nJenkins, No. 93–1823, 1995 WL 61093 (U.S. argued Jan. 11, 1995), in which petitioner alleges that the trial court \nimpermissibly engaged in a comparison of student test results in the school district in question with student test \nresults in other (i.e., suburban) districts, was not before this Court. \n \n3  “There is serious imbalance in this district,” wrote one SED staff member, “with almost two-thirds of the schools out \n  of balance.” YBE Exh. 16–46B. \n \n4  The State was kept informed of the segregative conditions in the Yonkers schools primarily by virtue of statistical \n  information depicting the racial composition of school districts and particular school buildings which the SED \nrequired local school personnel to submit. See, e.g., Deposition of Stanley C. Campbell, Dated November 28, 1990 \n(“Campbell Dep.”), at 37–38; Ramsey Dep. at 22–26; Deposition of Morton J. Sobel, Dated April 17, 1990 (“Sobel \nDep.”), at 176; Tr. 61–62 (Sheldon). These “racial censuses” began in 1966 and continued annually thereafter. YBE \nExh. 16–50 at 2. \n \n5  Racial segregation in the special education classes was one of the unlawful conditions in the Yonkers schools that \n  federal authorities found to exist, and decided to prosecute, in 1980. See YBE Exh. 17–120 at 3. \n \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 880 F.Supp. 212 (1995)   \n99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \n \n6  Commissioner Ambach had requested Stone to report to him on whether de jure segregation existed in any \n  educational institution in New York. YBE Exh. T. Stone responded with the conclusory statement: \nI assume that the ... reference to de jure segregation relates to segregation on the basis of race, color or \nnational origin, and does not relate to segregation or distinctions based on such other factors as age or sex. \nBased upon that assumption, and since de jure of course means arising out of a legal requirement, I think we \ncan say with confidence that de jure segregation on the basis of race, color or national origin does not exist in \nany school district or educational institution in this State. \nYBE Exh. U. \n \n7  Section 310 provides in pertinent part: \n  Any party conceiving himself aggrieved may appeal by petition to the commissioner of education who is hereby \nauthorized and required to examine and decide the same; and the commissioner of education may also \ninstitute such proceedings as are authorized under this article. \nN.Y.Educ.L. § 310 (McKinney 1988). \n \n8  It is important to note that these supervisory and enforcement options are not recognized as such merely as a \n  matter of hindsight, but rather were available to the State at the time of the events in question in this litigation. For \nexample, in the early 1970’s, when the SED was considering a plan of proactive intervention in districts exhibiting a \nhigh degree of racial imbalance, one SED official had this to say about the Commissioner’s § 310 powers: \nStrictly speaking the Department [i.e., the SED] has not initiated action in individual school districts. Formal \nDepartment action of the kind that results in a Commissioner’s order to a district to develop a plan for \ncorrecting racial imbalance has always come as a result of an appeal to the Commissioner by citizens of a school \ndistrict.... It is true that Section 310 does provide for the Commissioner himself instituting hearings in which a \ndistrict would be required to show cause why it does not correct racial imbalance. The use of this provision of \nthe Law is, of course, a possibility: whether or not it will be used has not been decided at this point. \nYBE Exh. 16–44 at 5 (emphasis in original); see also YBE Exhs. 16–50 at 4; 16–62 at 4. One of the racial integration \npolicy statements issued by the Regents endorsed the idea of State initiative in desegregation matters by putting \nsquarely on the State the responsibility of stepping in and imposing remedial measures in the event that local \nofficials failed to act. See YBE Exh. 3–7, “Integration and the Schools: A Statement of Policy and Recommendations \nby the Regents of the University of the State of New York,” at 12 (“Where the solution to the problem [of racial \nintegration in the schools] is beyond the capability of the local school districts, or where a district fails or refuses \nto act, then the responsibility for corrective action is clearly and inescapably that of the State.”). And, when \nGordon Ambach began his tenure as Commissioner of Education in 1977, he told the SED staff that, with regard to \nracial integration, “[w]here local district action lags or is outside legal obligation, our responsibility is to assure \n[that] the rights of all persons are protected fully.” YBE Exh. 14–44 at 7. \n \n9  In the mid–1950’s, a number of Yonkers citizens complained to State education officials that the Yonkers schools \n  were being neglected and inadequately funded. After considering the citizens’ appeal, then-Commissioner Wilson \nconcluded that: \n[i]t is quite evident that as Commissioner of Education I am not justified in apportioning public moneys to any \ncommunity if it fails to carry out its own obligations in the way of providing instructional services for its \nchildren. The situation at Yonkers will need to be resolved to the extent that I am satisfied that it is proper for \nme to continue to apportion public moneys to such district.... The [Yonkers] Board of Education will be required \nto submit to me before January first next sufficient evidence of an adequate program, both in respect to its \neducation offerings and its building needs for the ensuing year, which would justify me in making an \napportionment for such year. \nYBE Exh. 2–3 at 1. When Yonkers showed an intention to comply with the State’s recommendations for improving \nits school system, the State withdrew its threat to cut off state aid. Id. at 4. \n \n10  In citizen-instigated and sua sponte § 310 proceedings relating to desegregation, the burden is simply to establish \n  the existence of racial imbalance in the challenged school district, not to establish the cause of the imbalance. Tr. \n2239 (Stone). The statistical data the SED routinely collected would therefore have provided the Commissioner with \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 880 F.Supp. 212 (1995)   \n99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \n \nan adequate factual basis on which to proceed. \n \n11  The State made serious efforts to inform the Yonkers public as to how a private citizen or citizens’ organization \n  could trigger a State investigation under § 310. See, e.g., YBE Exh. 17–49 at 1. \n \n12  In 1976, one New York State Senator refused to vote for a bill that was similar to Chapter 342 on the grounds that \n  he had already taken the steps needed to stop forced busing by voting for the election of three new regents, \n“everyone of whom” was opposed to Commissioner Nyquist’s § 310 efforts. YBE Exh. 7–37 at 79 (remarks of Senator \nHalperin). \n \n13  The revised statements emphasized that desegregation efforts, such as the use of forced busing, should not be \n  allowed to jeopardize the health and safety of children, see YBE Exh. 11–17, and that the use of quantitative \nmeasures (i.e., quotas) was not the sole or even principal means for detecting and correcting school segregation. \nYBE Exhs. 3–14; 17–44. \n \n14  There is no evidence that the Legislature or the Regents ever made any efforts to communicate to SED officials that, \n  despite appearances to the contrary, they continued to support vigorous desegregation efforts. \n \n15  “Q.: With respect to the state requirements[,] if a school district wasn’t in compliance with state requirements, did \n  that lead to some direct action by the state to bring them into compliance or was there some recognition, well, we \nhave these requirements, not everyone has to follow them?” \n“A.: Where a problem was identified, they would be told to correct the situation, and I can’t \nthink of an instance where it was not corrected once the problem was identified.” \n \n16  As was the case with SED officials who entertained a similar belief, the State made no serious effort (such as by a \n  statement from the Board of Regents itself) to dispel the notion that the State had ceased to be committed to \nschool desegregation. See, e.g., Tr. 2383–87 (Kendall); 2609–11 (Griffith). The Regents can be charged with \nknowledge of the public’s impression of State retrenchment on desegregation matters because of the news \nclippings from around the State which they regularly received and reviewed. See Tr. 2384 (Kendall); Tr. 2553–54 \n(Griffith). \n \n17  Ultimately, Otis Elevator rejected proposals to stay in Yonkers and opted to move out. See 624 F.Supp. at 1319. \n   \n18  “Scattered site” housing refers to housing that is geographically distributed in different neighborhoods, as opposed \n  to housing concentrated in low-income, heavily minority areas. See, e.g., Deposition of Gerald Lenaz, Dated May 18, \n1983 (“Lenaz Dep.”), at 97. \n \n19  In addition to using its override powers to achieve scattered-site housing despite community opposition, the UDC \n  could have used the threat of such an action as leverage in negotiating with local public officials to achieve the same \nresult. See Tr. 1253 (Danielson) (describing the override power as “a bargaining instrument of very substantial \npotential.”). However, there is little evidence that the UDC attempted even this lesser course of action. \n \n20  The UDC approved these units pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding entered into with the City in July, 1970 \n  and amended in 1971 and 1972. YBE Exhs. 19–81; 19–113; 19–174. \n \n21  “Of course a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under § \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 880 F.Supp. 212 (1995)   \n99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \n \n  1983 because ‘official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.’ ” (quoting \nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3106 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985)). \n \n22  The plaintiffs did introduce at trial evidence indicating that Governor Cuomo played a role in the State’s decision in \n  1984 not to condition its financial bailout of Yonkers on the City’s acceptance of a consent decree with the federal \ngovernment. See supra p. 224. We do not think, however, that the Governor is amenable to an order to provide \nprospective relief to the Yonkers schools simply because he may have purposely decided to forego a one-time \ninstance of political leverage over Yonkers. This instance appears to have been an anomaly, in the sense that it \nbrought a State official who normally had no direct involvement in educational matters into ad hoc contact with an \neducational problem. \n \n23  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has already decided that the UDC may not successfully assert the Eleventh \n  Amendment as a defense to this action. United States v. Yonkers, No. 92–6198, slip op. at 3, 990 F.2d 623 (2d Cir. \nJan. 13, 1993). \n \n24  Whether the New York State Board of Regents can be classified as a State “agency” for Eleventh Amendment \n  purposes appears to be a question of first impression in this Circuit. However, given that the Second Circuit has \nruled that the State University of New York is itself an integral part of the government of the New York and partakes \nof the State’s sovereign immunity, see Dube v. State University of New York, 900 F.2d 587, 594–95 (2d Cir.1990), \ncert. denied, 501 U.S. 1211, 111 S.Ct. 2814, 115 L.Ed.2d 986 (1991), we conclude that the University’s governing \nbody—the Board of Regents—enjoys sovereign immunity as well. \n \n25  Plaintiffs have alleged that the State of New York, in the form of the State Legislature, contributed to the school \n  segregation in Yonkers by, inter alia, passing and debating bills designed to limit the efficacy of State desegregation \nefforts and refusing to provide the financial support necessary for successful desegregation. See, e.g., Second \nAmended Complaint of Plaintiff–Intervenors Yonkers Branch NAACP, et al., ¶¶ 20–25, 35, 37; Cross–Claim of the \nYonkers Board of Education, ¶¶ 14–23, 30. \nContrary to what the State urges, neither the First Amendment nor the Speech and Debate Clause of Article 1, § 6 \nof the Constitution is implicated by a holding that acts and omissions of the State Legislature furnish the basis for \na claim against the State under Title VI. The issue is not whether members of the State Legislature are to be \npunished under the Constitution or a federal statute for what was said and done in the Legislature during the \nyears in question in this lawsuit. Rather, the issue is whether the State’s attitude toward desegregation, as made \nknown through what was said and done in the State Legislature, properly gives rise to an allegation that the State, \nalong with its instrumentalities, contributed to a violation of rights for which the remedy of a lawsuit in federal \ncourt has been explicitly provided. \n \n26  As we discuss below in our section on the UDC, this is not the case with regard to actions taken by governmental \n  actors in areas other than education. See infra p. 242. \n \n27  The State’s position throughout this litigation has been that it did not intentionally support or contribute to the \n  segregation in the Yonkers schools. The State has never made an alternative argument to the effect that, even if it \ndid intentionally support or contribute to segregation in Yonkers prior to 1985, it has since taken the steps necessary \nto eliminate the effects of its unconstitutional acts. Indeed, the Court has already found, in a separate proceeding, \nthat vestiges of segregation do continue to exist in the Yonkers schools. See United States v. Yonkers, 833 F.Supp. \n214 (S.D.N.Y.1993). \n \n28  The Fordice Court appeared to assume, without actually deciding, that post-October, 1986 vestiges of pre-October, \n  1986 discriminatory acts are actionable under Title VI. \n \n29  New York has outlawed de jure segregation since 1900. \n   \n30  We note that this statement would apply a fortiori to Yonkers, since by virtue of the § 310 proceedings, the State \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 880 F.Supp. 212 (1995)   \n99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \n \n  played a far more active role vis-a-vis the Buffalo segregated schools than it did vis-a-vis the Yonkers segregated \nschools. \n \n31  The United States Supreme Court has decided to review a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court holding that a \n  state constitutional amendment that prohibits considerations of sexual orientation from being used as grounds for \npreferential treatment or “protected status” violates the Equal Protection Clause. See Evans v. Romer, 882 P.2d \n1335 (Colo.1994), cert. granted, 513 U.S. 1146, 115 S.Ct. 1092, 130 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1995); Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d \n1270 (Colo.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 959, 114 S.Ct. 419, 126 L.Ed.2d 365 (1993). The Colorado Supreme Court based \nits ruling on its conclusion that the state amendment infringes the fundamental right of citizens to participate in the \npolitical process on equal terms by making it comparably more difficult for members of an “identifiable group” (i.e., \nthose of homosexual or bisexual orientation) to win passage of legislation in their interest. 854 P.2d at 1282. The \ncourt assumed, without deciding, that gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals do not constitute a suspect class. Id. at 1275. \nThe Colorado case thus concerns the extent to which, in the absence of a suspect class, a state may remove from the \nnormal, sub-constitutional legislative process issues that are of particular concern to discrete groups of citizens. \nHere, however, plaintiffs sue on behalf of a group recognized by the courts to be a suspect class. This case \naccordingly presents different issues from those raised in Romer. \n \n32  Neither the NAACP’s Second Amended Complaint nor the YBE’s Cross–Claim against the State includes any citation \n  to the EEOA. However, the NAACP did rely on the EEOA for jurisdictional purposes in its papers in opposition to the \nState’s motion to dismiss. See Plaintiff–Intervenors’ Reply To State Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss at 14–15 (filed \nwith the Court on June 9, 1989). \n \n33  The Ferndale Court appeared to believe that the standard of state liability under § 1703 of the EEOA was \n  coextensive with the standard of state liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See 577 F.2d at 1348 (noting that the same \nprinciple of joint liability animates the two statutes). But see id. at 1346 (reserving decision on whether the rights \nguaranteed by the two statutes are the same). The State relies on this fact to argue that Arthur v. Nyquist, setting \nforth the Second Circuit’s construction of state liability under § 1983, controls any interpretation of § 1703 of the \nEEOA, such that if plaintiffs lose under Arthur, they lose under the EEOA. See The State Defendants’ Brief in \nResponse to the Court’s February 28, 1995 Order at 9–10. \nHowever, as discussed above, the Sixth Circuit has interpreted liability under § 1983 in a more expansive way than \nthe Second Circuit. See supra part III.A.2.a. Any conclusion on the Sixth Circuit’s part that the EEOA imposes the \nsame substantive duties as § 1983 is attributable, in our view, to its more expansive reading of § 1983 rather than \nto an overly broad interpretation of the scope of the duties imposed by the EEOA. \n \n34  Neither the Arthur decision itself, nor the pleadings and briefs filed in the case, contains any citation or reference to \n  the EEOA. \n \n35  The State housing defendants alternatively argue that plaintiff’s claims should be barred by the equitable doctrine of \n  laches. We disagree. Defendants assert that they have suffered prejudice by virtue of their absence from the lengthy \ndiscovery and trial proceedings involving the liability of the City of Yonkers and the YBE. However, defendants’ only \nsignificant showing of prejudice is the unavailability of one witness, Frank Kristof, who we find was not the sole \nrepository of any critical testimonial evidence. See Tr. 2311–17 (Winnick). As we stated in an earlier opinion, it can \nbe wondered, in light of the voluminous record already compiled at the expense of other parties, whether \ndefendants should view their belated joinder in this litigation as a bane or a blessing. See United States v. City of \nYonkers, No. 80 Civ. 6761, 1989 WL 88698, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 1989). \n \n36  Monell and Praprotnik would preclude the vicarious liability under § 1983 of State education officials for the actions \n  of the UDC. Moreover, at least one court has found that there also can be no vicarious liability under Title VI. See \nHodges v. Public Building Comm’n, 873 F.Supp. 128, 132 (N.D.Ill.1995); cf. Springer v. Seaman, 821 F.2d 871, 881 (1st \nCir.1987) (finding no case addressing the issue of vicarious liability under Title VI). Although the EEOA appears to \nprovide precisely the type of vicarious liability not otherwise imposed under § 1983 and Title VI, see supra pp. \n239–240, the EEOA does not apply to the actions of the UDC, but only to the actions of “educational agencies” or \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 880 F.Supp. 212 (1995)   \n99 Ed. Law Rep. 364 \n \nthe state itself. \n \n37  There is evidence that at least some SED staff knew during the mid-to-late 1970’s that Yonkers was planning to build \n  subsidized housing in a way that would enhance segregation.

Furthermore, as the UDC is not the State, 880 \nF.Supp. at 243–44, the notion that UDC could plan State assistance is similarly unfounded. \n(State Defs.’ Reply Mem. at 22 n. 7.) \n \n6  All exhibits introduced at the Monitor’s proceedings have been received in evidence before this Court. (See Trial Tr. \n  at 27.) \n \n7  A further description of EIP II is set forth in the Order which immediately follows this Opinion and sets forth in \n  greater detail the steps to be taken in an effort to eradicate vestiges of segregation in the YPS. \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 984 F.Supp. 687 (1997)   \n123 Ed. Law Rep. 544 \n \n \n8  The State’s witness, Dr. Bucci, testified that several months were necessary to develop an effective individual school \n  implementation budget. (Trial Tr. at 144–45.) \n \n9  Superintendent of Schools, Reginald Marra, testified as follows: \n  Q. You’re familiar with the vestiges decision that the court issued in 1993. Is that correct? \nA. That’s correct. \nQ. Has anyone from the State Education Department ever contacted you or the schools about that decision? \nA. No. \nQ. To what extent has anyone in the State Education Department ever undertaken to evaluate the conditions in \nthe Yonkers Public Schools to see whether they’re consistent or inconsistent with the statements in that \ndecision? \nA. Not that I am aware of. \n(Trial Tr. at 972–73.) \n \n10  During the 1993 vestiges hearing the City took the position that the YBE and NAACP had not proven the existence of \n  vestiges which the City was due to remediate under applicable federal law and presently asserts that it has not \nwaived this position. (Def. City of Yonkers’ Post–Hr’g Mem. at 3.) We reject the concept that vestiges require \neradication if State funds are available for this purpose but may be tolerated if State funds are not forthcoming. \n \n1  New York State aid to education is predicated on essentially two sources: formula aid and categorical aid. Formula \n  aid supports basic, State mandated educational programs, is strictly determined and reflective of personal wealth \nand real estate values as measured within each school district. Since 1993–94, formula-based aid has included a \n“transition cap” intended to respond to equity issues emanating from the basic aid formula; actual payment of the \ntransition adjustment has been constrained since its inception by a “transition cap” imposed as a result of State \nbudgetary limitations. Categorical aid is discretionary, decided annually through State budgetary appropriations, and \ntargeted  to  specific  programs  and  services  (e.g.,  technology,  magnet  programs,  transportation,  capital \nexpenditures....). In 1996–97, Yonkers received approximately $39 million in formula aid and $44 million in \ncategorical aid from the State. \n \n2  The question of how EIP I is currently funded becomes an issue only if one assumes that the future distribution of \n  EIP I costs will not be borne solely by the City nor solely by the State. In fact, given the absence of any compelling \nreason to skew the distribution of burden toward either the City or State, it is assumed the City and State will share \nequally, 50–50, at least those costs of EIP I which flow directly from the 1986 Order and which are summarized \nabove and cited in YBOE Exhibit 3. Thus, once the assumption is made that the City and State will share the burden, \nan issue arises as to whether some degree of sharing has already occurred, de facto, given State reimbursement to \ntransportation and capital improvements and given State magnet program grants and further, whether the State \nshould be relieved, therefore, of any burden beyond such reimbursements and grants assuming they are continued \nand constitute at least 50% of ordered funding requirements. \n \n*  It may be of some interest to note that Buffalo, beneficiary of the largest magnet aid award in 1983 when such aid \n  program began, had been involved in desegregation litigation since 1976. \n \n3  Is it not possible that magnet program aid can serve two functions simultaneously and fully: negotiated equity \n  adjustments and magnet program contribution? It seems not, especially given the State’s bifurcated aid system. \nNegotiated equity adjustments emanate from doubts surrounding the State’s formula aid (non-categorical) for State \nmandated education. Any effort to address funding formula inequities via categorical grants (e.g., magnet aid) must \nbe viewed, de facto, as an effort to leaven basic aid for State mandated programs and not for magnet programs \nwhich are recognized, but not mandated, by the State and therefore funded through categorical, rather than \nformula, aid. Said simply, the same dollar cannot claim to serve both formula and categorical aid. \n \n4  A secondary and positive, though unintended, effect of such “sufficiency” may be the City’s economic facility (as \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 984 F.Supp. 687 (1997)   \n123 Ed. Law Rep. 544 \n \n  distinct from ability) to address the Housing Order in a complementary, rather than competitive, manner vis a vis \nthe School Order. \n \n5  State reimbursement for capital costs is provided as an annual offset to debt service and not as a lump sum \n  payment against the principal cost of a facility. Given Option (1), then, the State would be required to contribute \napproximately $26 million beyond the $83 million level of 1996–97 aid. In addition, future operating and capital \ncosts would be borne equally. \n \n6  It may be that, given changes in State funding mechanisms, the “transition adjustment”, as a measure of inequity \n  will change not only in terms of its dollar value, but the mechanism for measurement conceivably may be \nabandoned. Such circumstance should not upset this analysis which is intended only to establish a base level for \nimposing an immediate, fiscal ‘97 based judgment upon the State (yet another reason for limiting a reliance on \narguments wedded to the deciphering of State aid processes to a short-term, not longer-term, financial distribution \ntemplate). \n \n7  The City may view this position as inherently unfair because it has had to bear much of the cost of EIP I since 1986; \n  because it believes State aid formulas are especially unfair to Yonkers; and, therefore, because it perhaps hoped for \ncompensatory relief. But the task here is not one of remedying alleged inequities in alleged inequities in formula aid, \nnor is it to compensate the City for shouldering much of the burden prior to a finding of State liability. The task \nbefore the Monitor is to assess a defensible burden upon the State, based on credible testimony and evidence \nsufficient to insure the effective implementation of the 1986 Order. Issues of compensatory justice for a Yonkers \nclaim that the State should reimburse Yonkers for alleged disproportionate burdens it bore prior to October 1996 \nand/or for funding inequities are left to the Federal and State judiciary, respectively. \n \n1  For the purposes of this Order, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “State” encompasses the following \n  defendants: The State of New York; The Board of Regents of the State of New York; Carl T.

For a magnet school, the \n  minority enrollment had to be within 15 percentage points of the system-wide minority population in the first year \nand within 10 points in all subsequent years. For non-magnet schools, the figure was 20 percentage points. See \nYonkers III, 837 F.2d at 1215. \n \n2  The Board proffered testimony that, in some classrooms, students of the same race sat in clusters—something that \n  could be attributed to cliques and affinities among students. The Board has floated the idea that these groupings \nmay have been segregative seating assignment by teachers, but counsel for the Board was unable to say at oral \nargument why, if such an outrageous practice existed, it could not be rectified by Board-imposed discipline or \ndismissal, without remedial funding from the State. \n \n3  In partial dissent, Judge Sack would return this case to the district court for a clearer articulation of its factual \n  findings. We conclude, however, that the defect of the district court opinion—the absence of affirmable findings \nconcerning vestiges of discrimination—would not be remedied by remand. \n \n\nU.S. v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d 301 (1999)   \n136 Ed. Law Rep. 663 \n \nThe district judge is steeped in the law of this case, and has a commanding knowledge of its facts. There are talented \nlawyers on all sides. There is no reason to assume that the absence of affirmable facts in the district court opinion is \nattributable to any oversight by the district judge (or by the lawyers) or any failure to take pains or to appreciate \nwhat is required. And we have conducted our own careful scrutiny of the record, to see if it could support findings of \nvestige and to justify a remand if anything were there. Our review has been guided by counsel having a great \nincentive and a full opportunity to highlight any evidence pointing to the existence of vestiges. In the end, we are \nconvinced that a remand would waste judicial resources and put off what in the end would be the same result. \nAbsent good reason to remand, we will decide the appeal on the record before us.

In addition to the portions cited by the majority opinion, and merely \n  dipping into the record, Sylvia Muckelvaney, a teacher in a magnet school, testified that treatment of minority \nstudents “relate[s] back to prior segregation” in that “there are segments of the staff in the city that were not happy \nin 1986 and are still not” and so maintain “a them-and-us kind of mentality” towards minority students. Bedelia \nFries, the principal of Lincoln High School, testified that differential treatment of minority students at her school \nresults from the perception of it as a “dumping ground” during segregation. Edda Cardona Zuckerman, Principal of \nSchool 21, testified that “teachers who have been there the longest seem to have lower expectations of minority \nchildren than some of the other teachers who perhaps are newer to the district or have not been dealing with just \none population of students for a long period of time.” \n \n6  Since there is no factual finding by the district court that this evidence proves a vestige, the majority is unable to say \n  such a finding is clearly erroneous; it therefore says simply that the evidence “is not enough.” Ante at 315–16. \n \n7  I am inclined to agree with the majority’s conclusion that it is the NAACP and the Board of Education that must \n  shoulder the burden of proof to establish the existence of vestiges for, inter alia, the reasons stated in the majority \nopinion. Ante at 309–12. But even if the burden were on the State to demonstrate that identified racial disparities \nare not a result of prior de jure segregation, I would nonetheless conclude that a remand is the appropriate course \nbecause the district court’s findings would still fall short of Rule 52(a)’s requirements: They do not clearly identify \nvestiges or explain how they are established by the evidence. \n \n8  There are two intertwined strands of logic supporting particular deference to the district court in these cases. One \n  arises from the typical situation where the district judge resides in the community of the desegregating schools but \nthe reviewing judges, or most of them, do not. The district judge is then, on a daily basis, closer to the subject \nmatter of the litigation. That is not the case here, where the district court and we share a geographical location \nequally apart if not far from the subject school district. \nBut the second and I think more fundamental basis for deference is the district judge’s familiarity with the \ncommunity and its schools based on his or her intimate knowledge of the manifold, complex and subtle facts of the \nlitigation, the judge’s own orders, and the community’s responses to them, over a very long period of time. That is \ncertainly so here: The difference between the district judge’s knowledge of this case and ours would scarcely be \ngreater if his chambers were situated on one side of the Yonkers City Hall and his courtroom on the other. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 624 F.Supp. 1276, 1289–1376 (S.D.N.Y.1985). Though UDC was not a party \nto the original litigation, the 1985 opinion does describe the role of the UDC, in cooperation with the City Council of \nYonkers, in the sponsorship and construction of seven of the subsidized housing projects for families built in Yonkers \nduring the period 1968–1972. Id. 624 F.Supp. at 1314. That opinion addresses the role of the UDC, specifically, in the \nperpetuation of what this Court found to be “a pattern and practice of racial discrimination by City officials, pursued \nin response to constituent pressure to select or support only sites that would preserve existing patterns of racial \nsegregation, and to reject or oppose sites that would threaten existing patterns of segregation.” Id. 624 F.Supp. at \n1373. \n \n2  “The UDC embarked on this task with enthusiasm, initially pushing for ‘scattered site’ housing throughout the City of \n  Yonkers. For example, a list of possible sites referred by the UDC to City officials in June, 1969 contained eleven \nlocations in different parts of the City. However, the UDC was soon made aware of strong local opposition to the \nbuilding of subsidized housing in the predominantly white areas outside of Southwest Yonkers. The UDC clearly had \nat least some knowledge that this opposition was race-based. We find that the UDC, confronted with this race-based \ncommunity opposition and concerned about the political feasibility of scattered-site housing, made a determination \nnot to exercise its statutory override powers which would have enabled it to proceed without local approval.” \nUnited States v.

The proposal that UDC should now plan housing assistance is \nthus meaningless.” (State Defs.’ Reply Mem. of 10/6/97, at 22 n. 7.) \n \n4  See, e.g., Waybro Corp. v.

Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 635 F.Supp. 1538 (S.D.N.Y.1986), which spawned a separate history of \nlitigation that is not directly relevant to the present appeal. \n \n2  On August 2, 1988, the District Court found both the City and several individual City Council-members in civil \n  contempt of its earlier remedial orders. This Court subsequently affirmed the contempt sanctions, although it \nlimited  the  fines  levied  against  the  City,  which  had  previously  been  doubling  on  each  consecutive  day  of \nnon-compliance, to $ 1 million per day. United States v. City of Yonkers, 856 F.2d 444, 460 (2d Cir.1988). The \nSupreme Court subsequently reversed the contempt sanction as applied to the individual council members. Spallone \nv. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 280, 110 S.Ct. 625, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990). \n \n3  It is worth noting that there is a stick built into even the carrot: if the City falls short of these goals, it receives less \n  than one unit of credit for each priority one family placed. \n \n4  We reject the NAACP’s contention that the terms of the TSLTPO do not modify those of the SSLTPO. \n   \n5  Although the text of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) focuses on modifications that relieve a party from the operation of a consent \n  decree, the above quotation clearly demonstrates that modifications, such as the one in the TSLTPO, that increase \nthe obligations imposed by a consent decree are also permissible. See also United States v. Western Elec. Co., 46 \nF.3d 1198, 1202 (D.C.Cir.1995) (noting that “[a]t the request of the party who sought the equitable relief, a court \nmay tighten the decree in order to accomplish its intended result”). \n \n6  In articulating this standard, Rufo in effect adopted the rule this Court had articulated earlier in New York State \n  Assoc. for Retarded Children v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, 969–71 (2d Cir .1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 915, 104 S.Ct. 277, \n78 L.Ed.2d 257 (1983). \n \n7  Furthermore, Rufo notes that “unforseen” does not in this context mean “unforseen and unforeseeable” and that \n  “[l]itigants are not required to anticipate every exigency that could conceivably arise during the life of a consent \ndecree.” Id. at 385, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867. \n \n8  The City’s response-that 70% of the beneficiaries under the SSLTPO were minority families-cannot answer this \n  charge. Achieving the remedy’s integrative goals depends not simply on providing subsidized housing to minority \n \n\nU.S. v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 239 F.3d 211 (2001)   \n \n \nfamilies but rather on locating minority housing outside of predominantly minority neighborhoods or locating white \nhousing outside of predominantly white neighborhoods. \n \n9  Our own inspection of Gov’t Exhibit I generates slightly different figures, namely that 29 out of 63, or 46% of, moves \n  were non-integrative. Furthermore, the government brief reports still other numbers, specifically that 33 of 58, or \n59.6% of, moves were by minority households into “predominantly minority communities” or by white households \ninto “predominantly white communities.” The pages of the appendix the government cites in support of its \ncontention allude to the question but contain no precise claim. \n \n10  Our own inspection of Gov’t Exhibit J once again suggests slightly different numbers, specifically that, 14 out of 26, \n  or 53.8% of, moves were non-integrative, and the government brief reports that 16 of 26, or 61.5% of, moves were \nby minority households into or “adjacent” to “predominantly minority communities” or by white households into \n“predominantly white communities.” And again, the pages of the appendix the government cites in support of its \ncontention allude to the question but contain no precise claim. The NAACP has asserted that 13 of these 26 moves \nwere non-integrative. \n \n11  The data needed for determining the integrative effect of the City’s housing program during the first year of the \n  SSLTPO are not available. \n \n12  A  district  court’s  determination  that  a  race-conscious  remedy  is  narrowly  tailored  to  advance  a  compelling \n  government interest involves an application of law to facts, which we review de novo.

The  State  argues  that  giving  District Court to give the State such a credit against future \nYonkers the entire benefit of the federal grant departs  spending obligations. \nfrom the 50–50 formula, is unfair to the State since only    \ncities  can  apply  for  these  federal  funds,  and  fails  to   \nrecognize that Yonkers will retain a substantial incentive   \nto  seek  outside  funding  even  if  it  derives  only  a  50 \npercent benefit.

That numbering does not assign a roman numeral to one of the \npublished decisions, the District Court’s 1995 decision, reported at 880 F.Supp. 212, a decision reversed in Yonkers \nV, 96 F.3d 600 (2d Cir.1996). \n \n2  A desegregation remedy is not complete until “vestiges” of segregation that have a present discriminatory effect \n  have been eliminated.

Should the Court find that one or both parties have failed to maintain budgetary effort and that such \nfailure has been or will be adverse to the effectiveness of the remedy, the Court may order a revision in the \nremedy apportionment ratio and/or the amount of EIP funding. \n \n7  The State had already paid its FY 1997 bill, but sought to have half the federal magnet school aid paid for that year \n  credited against future judgments. The District Court, in an order dated February 10, 1998, had previously left open \nthe possibility of future adjustments in the event that unresolved State contentions were upheld. \n \n8  Judge Sand noted that the issue for FY 1997 could not be resolved based on the intent of the federal donor because \n  the federal grant was made before the City had begun sharing remedial costs with the State. He urged the parties to \npursue joint federal applications in the future, fully disclosing their cost-sharing obligations. \n \n9  The YBE also cross-appealed in No. 98–6199, but makes no claims for affirmative relief in its brief. \n \n\nYonkers Branch-N.A.A.C.P. v.

Under the existing collective bargaining agreement, teachers are permitted to transfer \n  voluntarily (or may be required to transfer involuntarily) on the basis of seniority. Seniority may be displaced by \nmandatory reassignment when students are to be provided with a unique learning skill or experience that cannot be \nsatisfied under such a system. It also may be waived as a requirement for up to 25 voluntary transfers into newly \ncreated positions that will enhance staff integration on the basis of race, experience or training. \nThe Board’s original proposal provided that the procedures outlined in Article 15 would govern transfers and \nstaffing changes except where they would adversely impact on the racial and/or experiential composition set \nforth in that plan—for racial balance, plus or minus five percentage points of the district for each grade pattern \norganization level, and for experience range, plus or minus fifteen percentage points. Educational Improvement \nPlan for the Yonkers Public School System of February 17, 1986 at 237. The Board subsequently withdrew this \nprovision (see Brief of Yonkers Bd. of Educ. Regarding Plaintiff-Intervenors’ Response in Opp. to the Board’s \nModified Educ. Improvement Plan, April 7, 1986, at 11–12) and, thus, only the NAACP currently advocates the \nproposal which impelled the YFT to intervene. Tr. of Remedy Hearing (hereinafter “Tr.”) at 46; see also NAACP’s \nResponse in Opp. to Modified Educ. Improvement Plan for the Yonkers School System Filed on April 2, 1986 by the \nYonkers Bd. of Educ., at 25–26. \n \n4  On April 2, 1986, this Court denied the Organization of Hispanic Parents of Yonkers’ motion to intervene, but \n  granted it leave to file a brief as amicus curiae. \n \n27 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., Not Reported in F.Supp. (1986)   \n \n \n5  Dr. Pack expressed concern primarily for Gorton High School, which is slated for use as a strong pre-professional \n  magnet. However, if, for example, a strong social science academic magnet program was introduced at Yonkers, it \nwould not overlap with Gorton’s nor any other area high school’s programs. Tr. 746. If the Board finds that Yonkers \nHigh School could not accommodate an academic program without an expanded prospective enrollment beyond the \n1,200 contemplated by the Board, the Court does not perceive this as a barrier in light of the physical capacity of the \nbuilding and the testimony adduced herein. Tr. 743. \n \n6  Furthermore, for these same reasons, a move to the Whitman facility in the middle of the school term would not \n  prove disruptive. Many of these planned programs are housed in no particular place. Activities such as teacher \ntraining, for example, currently occur wherever room can be made available. Tr. 1113–14. \n \n7  Programming efforts also will be minimal because the Center builds on the successful student achievement of the \n  district’s State Funded Pre-Kindergarten Children and will replicate another nationally known program designed to \nprevent school failures of English or Spanish speaking children. \n \n8  Dr. Raymond also agrees with the efficacy of this approach (Tr. 1115–16)—i.e., to have in hand estimated \n  enrollments for all the programs available in September, 1987 in the preceding spring so that the degree of success \ncan be measured. \n \n9  Enrollment caps were endorsed by the Board’s own expert witness, Dr. Rossell. The Board’s other expert witness, \n  Dr. Bennett, called mandatory back-up provisions “helpful bordering on crucial.” Tr. 893. When an enrollment cap is \nplaced on a school, new students (those attending public school in the district for the first time as well as those \nmaking the transition from one grade level to another, such as from elementary school to junior high school) who \nare applying to the school are admitted only if their enrollment further assists the school in becoming desegregated. \nSee, e.g., Diaz v. San Jose School District, no. C–71–2130 (RFP), slip op. at 22 & n. 13 (N.D.Cal., Dec. 31, 1985); Tr. \n396–98; 898–900. Students reassigned because of the capping process are given the opportunity to select other \nschools to attend. \n \n10  At present, 9.3% of the elementary classroom teachers and 8.6% of the secondary classroom teachers are \n  minorities. Excluding special education students, the minority student population is presently 48.5%. \n \n11  The Court understands that a cluster of 20 or more Limited English Proficient (LEP) students per class is required to \n  establish a bilingual program. However, the fact that English as a second language (“ESL”) programs may be offered \nin schools without the requisite LEP cluster should in all likelihood give the Board enough flexibility to further the \ngoals of the plan while simultaneously providing for the needs of Spanish-speaking children and optimizing their \nchoices. \n \n*  The Court assumes that it is no longer necessary to keep School 11 open since the district shall implement the \n  magnet programs at Schools 18, 19, Fermi and King in September 1986. The district should advise the Court in its \nfurther submission if this is inaccurate. \n \n**  See page 8 infra. \n   \n***  The relevant minority population is comprised of Black and Hispanic students. \n   \n \n \n \n28 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v.

Because Yonkers has offered lower starting salaries than other\nWestchester communities or nearby NYC, has endured repeated budget crises, and\nperhaps because of the political and social turmoil which has been a part of Yonkers\nlife for so long, teacher recruitment has not been easy. According to Assistant Supt.\nJoseph Michael Guerney, Yonkers spends less per capita for education than any other\ncommunity in Westchester and would continue to do so even if the entire burden of\nfunding EIP II were placed upon the City. Operating in this fiscal context and in a city\nwhich has in the past resisted housing desegregation efforts w/ astonishing tenacity,\nthe YBE's task of integrating its long segregated school system is indeed a formidable\none. We find that the YBE, its former Supt., Dr. Joan Raymond, and her successor,\nDr. Donald Batista, and their staffs, addressed this task w/ enthusiasm and a sincere\ndesire to make EIP I succeed. This case is markedly different from the many cases in\nwhich further relief is sought by class representative because the managers of the\nCity's school system have been either passive or half−hearted in their efforts to\ndesegregate. We are satisfied that Dr. Batista's evaluation of the problems confronting\nthe YBE in its efforts to eradicate vestiges of segregation is an accurate one. We find\nthat although minority students in Yonkers attend school in the same buildings as\nmajority students, they are undergoing different educational experiences. Proof of this\nlies, we believe, in the data shown w/ respect to achievement scores, suspensions,\nretentions and drop−out rates. We emphasize that we have answered the three\nquestions posed in our 7/10/92 Opinion only and have not addressed any questions\nrelating to the State's liability for the existence of these conditions nor any question\nrelating to the relative responsibility of the City and State. These further questions\nwill be addressed at the next stage of these proceedings. The parties are to confer and\nadvise the Court in writing by 10/4/93 when they will be ready to proceed to trial on\nthe remaining questions ( Signed by Judge Leonard B. Sand ); Copies mailed.

The Board of Education's decision to implement the\ninterim spending plan by reducing its accrual for the NY Teachers Retirement System\nfor 1993−94 by the amount of $6.9 million is approved.

Because Yonkers has offered lower starting salaries than other\nWestchester communities or nearby NYC, has endured repeated budget crises, and\nperhaps because of the political and social turmoil which has been a part of Yonkers\nlife for so long, teacher recruitment has not been easy. According to Assistant Supt.\nJoseph Michael Guerney, Yonkers spends less per capita for education than any other\ncommunity in Westchester and would continue to do so even if the entire burden of\nfunding EIP II were placed upon the City. Operating in this fiscal context and in a city\n\nwhich has in the past resisted housing desegregation efforts w/ astonishing tenacity,\nthe YBE's task of integrating its long segregated school system is indeed a formidable\none. We find that the YBE, its former Supt., Dr. Joan Raymond, and her successor,\nDr. Donald Batista, and their staffs, addressed this task w/ enthusiasm and a sincere\ndesire to make EIP I succeed. This case is markedly different from the many cases in\nwhich further relief is sought by class representative because the managers of the\nCity's school system have been either passive or half−hearted in their efforts to\ndesegregate. We are satisfied that Dr. Batista's evaluation of the problems confronting\nthe YBE in its efforts to eradicate vestiges of segregation is an accurate one. We find\nthat although minority students in Yonkers attend school in the same buildings as\nmajority students, they are undergoing different educational experiences. Proof of this\nlies, we believe, in the data shown w/ respect to achievement scores, suspensions,\nretentions and drop−out rates. We emphasize that we have answered the three\nquestions posed in our 7/10/92 Opinion only and have not addressed any questions\nrelating to the State's liability for the existence of these conditions nor any question\nrelating to the relative responsibility of the City and State. These further questions\nwill be addressed at the next stage of these proceedings. The parties are to confer and\nadvise the Court in writing by 10/4/93 when they will be ready to proceed to trial on\nthe remaining questions .

Because\nYonkers has offered lower starting salaries than other Westchester communities or\nnearby NYC, has endured repeated budget crises, and perhaps because of the political\nand social turmoil which has been a part of Yonkers life for so long, teacher\nrecruitment has not been easy. According to Assistant Supt. Joseph Michael Guerney,\nYonkers spends less per capita for education than any other community in\nWestchester and would continue to do so even if the entire burden of funding EIP II\nwere placed upon the City. Operating in this fiscal context and in a city which has in\nthe past resisted housing desegregation efforts w/ astonishing tenacity, the YBE's task\nof integrating its long segregated school system is indeed a formidable one. We find\nthat the YBE, its former Supt., Dr. Joan Raymond, and her successor, Dr. Donald\nBatista, and their staffs, addressed this task w/ enthusiasm and a sincere desire to\nmake EIP I succeed. This case is markedly different from the many cases in which\nfurther relief is sought by class representative because the managers of the City's\nschool system have been either passive or half−hearted in their efforts to desegregate.\nWe are satisfied that Dr. Batista's evaluation of the problems confronting the YBE in\nits efforts to eradicate vestiges of segregation is an accurate one. We find that\nalthough minority students in Yonkers attend school in the same buildings as majority\nstudents, they are undergoing different educational experiences. Proof of this lies, we\nbelieve, in the data shown w/ respect to achievement scores, suspensions, retentions\nand drop−out rates. We emphasize that we have answered the three questions posed in\nour 7/10/92 Opinion only and have not addressed any questions relating to the State's\nliability for the existence of these conditions nor any question relating to the relative\nresponsibility of the City and State. These further questions will be addressed at the\n\nnext stage of these proceedings. The parties are to confer and advise the Court in\nwriting by 10/4/93 when they will be ready to proceed to trial on the remaining\nquestions .

The State and City can\nand should work cooperatively in conjunction with the Monitor and, if appropriate the\nEFCB, in establishing the most efficient and least costly means of providing these\nfunds.

The UDC has now waived the\nstatute of limitations defense with regard to the housing claims, and this defense is\ntherefore now moot; we therefore find that the statute of limitations defense, which\nhas been waived, does not bar the action against UDC for conduct for which the Court\nof Appeals has found it liable.

However, the City Council, despite the  resolution expressing its “concern” about the order and \nCity’s having neither objected to nor appealed from the  authorizing a subdivision of the City government, the \norder,  passed  a  resolution  stating  that  it  was  “deeply  Parks Board, to initiate litigation challenging the district \nconcerned with the ruling” and “has been made aware of  court’s authority to enter an order de-dedicating the park \nsimilar  concerns  by  the  Parks  Board.”  The  resolution  land.

The Court finds that, as of \n  1997,  vestiges  of  segregation  existed  in  the  Yonkers \n  public  schools.  We  therefore  refer  the  matter  to  the \n  Court-appointed  School  Monitor  to  report  and \nrecommend, after appropriate proceedings, as to a suitable \nremedy. \n  \n \nOPINION \n \nSAND, District Judge. \n \n\nU.S. v.

See United States v. City of Yonkers (“Yonkers VII ”), 197 F.3d 41 (2d Cir.1999). \n \n2  For a description of how EIP II emerged out of the concerns of Yonkers educators that there were “missing gaps” in \n  EIP I, see the testimony of Dr. Donald Batista, Superintendent of the YPS during the period in question. (See 1993 \nTrial Tr. at 38–39, 61–63, 127–29, 132–36, 166; see also id. at 543–45, 622–24 (Pack).) \n \n3  At the same time, Plaintiff–Intervenor, the Yonkers Branch—NAACP, amended its complaint to include claims \n  against the State Defendants. \n \n4  See United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., No. 80 Civ. 6761(LBS), 1989 WL 88698 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 1989), appeal \n  dismissed, 893 F.2d 498 (2d Cir.1990) (motion to dismiss); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., No. 80 Civ. \n6761(LBS), 1992 WL 176953, 1992 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 10059 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 1992) (summary judgment). \n \n5  The remedy ordered by this Court in 1997 contained detailed provisions for the monitoring, by an outside expert \n  observer, of the efficacy of the steps mandated by EIP II. As a consequence of the stay, there has not yet been any \nappraisal of the impact, if any, of EIP II during the time it was in effect. \n \n6  The remanding panel provided for “automatic restoration of appellate jurisdiction without a new notice of appeal” \n  once this Court had completed the limited task it had been assigned. Yonkers VII, at 46 (citing United States v. \nSalameh, 84 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir.1996); United States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir.1994)). Appellate jurisdiction \nis to be restored “when any of the parties furnishes a copy of the district court’s ruling on remand to the clerk of \n[the Court of Appeals].” Id. at 58. The clerk is then to refer the matter to the panel that decided Yonkers VII. As we \nexplain below, this opinion—being limited to an explanation of our finding that vestiges of segregation existed as of \n1997 without discussing the question of a remedy, as called for by the terms of the remand, see Yonkers VII, 197 \nF.3d at 58—does not yet fully satisfy the terms of the remand. Filing of this opinion, therefore, with the Clerk of the \nCourt of Appeals would not trigger the restoration of appellate jurisdiction. \n \n7  Because we foresee a possibility that, after the remanding panel has reviewed the findings set forth herein, the \n  NAACP might renew its request for rehearing en banc, we emphasize that this Court does not agree with the panel’s \nanalysis of the record. We nevertheless recognize, of course, that the appellate panel’s finding is the law of this case \nand we therefore have no authority to address the issue in this opinion. \n \n8  The State Defendants also read this passage as an articulation of a “standard of legally sufficient evidence,” which \n  they insist this Court is bound to apply in its consideration of any other putative vestiges of segregation. (See id. at \n11.) We do not understand, however, the State’s reasoning in urging that evidence which is insufficient for one \npurpose is necessarily insufficient for other purposes. That is not our understanding of the panel’s opinion and it is \nnot the approach we pursue in this opinion. \n \n9  For this Court’s approach to the achievement gap, see infra Part III(A) & Appendix A. \n   \n10  Our definition of a vestige of segregation is identical to the one we applied in our earlier opinion on this subject. See \n  Yonkers IV, 833 F.Supp. at 218–19. The Court of Appeals expressed no disagreement with that definition and we are \naware of no intervening legal development which would cause us to alter it. \n \n11  The fundamental document upon which New York’s State Education Department bases its programs is the New \n  Compact for Learning (“New Compact”). (See 1993 YBE Ex. 71.) The New Compact lists a set of fundamental \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \nprinciples which underlie the state’s educational system, first among which is the principle that “All children can \nlearn.... No child should be permitted to fail.” Indeed the phrase, “all children can learn” is the title of a \nsupplemental report prepared by the State Board of Regents in 1993–94 “to support schools and implement A New \nCompact for Learning.” (See 1993 YBE Ex. 72.) During the 1993 trial, one of the State Defendants’ witnesses, Barbara \nJ. Martinage, an SED employee, testified that the principle that all children can learn is a fundamental premise \nshared by all parties. (See 1993 Trial Tr. at 1892.) Similarly, Dr. Batista testified that, in his view, student outcome \nwas a universally recognized measure of a school’s success. (See id. at 84; see also id. at 1884–85 (Martinage).) \n \n12  The YBE takes no position, and has made no submission to the Court, with respect to this remand. Because the \n  findings on which we elaborate today are based on the record developed in the 1993 and 1997 trials, we refer \nthroughout this opinion to the positions taken by the YBE in the course of those proceedings, prior to the remand \nand have made occasional use of the YBE’s putative submission (see NAACP’s Reply Submission on Vestiges, Ex. 1) \nsolely as an aid to highlighting relevant portions of the extensive record before the Court. \n \n13  See infra Part III(A) & Appendix A. \n   \n14  Cf. Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 276, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (Powell, J., for \n  four-Justice plurality) (“characterizing the concept of societal discrimination as being too ‘amorphous’ to justify \nrace-conscious remedial measures”). \n \n15  The Court of Appeals’ withdrawn opinion concluded that it was appropriate to assign the burden of persuasion to \n  the YBE and the NAACP. See United States v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d at 309–12 (citations omitted). The court did \nnot address the question in its final opinion, reasoning that it was “immaterial” because the evidence was \n“inadequate to support the district court’s findings of vestiges regardless of where the burden of persuasion falls.” \nYonkers VII, 197 F.3d at 49–50; but see id. at 55 (addressing expert analysis of test scores and explaining that “[t]he \nburden of proof comes into play at this juncture. If (as is the case) the Yonkers Board cannot demonstrate salient \ndifferences between its experience with changing school demographics and the experience of other school districts, \nthere is no reason to attribute the Yonkers experience to circumstances particular to Yonkers and its history of \nsegregation.”). Although the court clearly does, therefore, seem to assign the burden of persuasion to the YBE and \nNAACP in the course of its opinion, we treat the issue as open given the court’s express assertion that the burden of \nproof issue is immaterial to its opinion. \nAlthough it is not necessary to our reasoning, we would assign the burden of persuasion to the City and the State \nDefendants. We recognize that, on a few occasions, courts have assigned the burden of proof to the party \nclaiming that vestiges exist. See Coalition, 90 F.3d at 776–77; Sch. Bd. v. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1312 (4th \nCir.1987); Riddick by Riddick v. Sch. Bd., 784 F.2d 521, 534 (4th Cir.1986). But the more common practice has \nalways been to allocate the burden of persuasion to the parties who have been found to have violated the \nConstitution. See Fordice, 505 U.S. at 739, 112 S.Ct. 2727; Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U.S. 189, \n209–10, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973); Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267. The decisions to the contrary \nin Coalition, Baliles, and Riddick are unpersuasive in this case because in each of those cases there had been \neither a declaration or, at least, a finding of unitary status. See Coalition, 90 F.3d at 758; Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1311; \nRiddick, 784 F.2d at 525. In Riddick, the vestiges issue was raised pursuant to an application to reinstate the case \nafter it had been dismissed. See Riddick, 784 F.2d at 525. Similarly, in Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st \nCir.1998)—a case heavily relied upon by the remanding panel—unitary status had been declared, see id. at 792 \n(citing Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313, 326 (1st Cir.1987)), and the issue of vestiges was before the court pursuant \nto a constitutional challenge to the race-conscious remedial policy that had been instituted during the period of \nfederal supervision. By contrast, in this case, there has been no finding or declaration of unitary status, and no \nparty has even filed an application to have unitary status declared. Once unitary status has been declared, a party \nalleging the existence of vestiges is in a posture similar to that of a plaintiff at the liability stage and, quite \nnaturally, therefore bears the burden of proof. But where, as is the case here, there has been no finding of unitary \nstatus, the parties alleging the existence of vestiges are entitled to a presumption that current disparities are tied \nto the violations we have previously found to have occurred. \nWe also recognize, as did the courts in Coalition and Baliles, that the traditional presumption that lingering \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \ndisparities are the effect of prior segregation has most commonly been applied with respect to the so-called \nGreen factors—faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and facilities. See Green v. County Sch. Bd., \n391 U.S. 430, 435, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). But the presumption has certainly not been limited, \nexclusively, to cases in which the only alleged vestiges are Green factors. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 205 F.3d 361, \n366 (8th Cir.2000) (placing the burden of proof on the defendant with respect to “the issue of reduction in \nstudent achievement and the achievement gap”), rev’d on other grounds, 216 F.3d 720 (8th Cir.2000) (en banc). In \nfact, in Coalition itself, the court notes that at earlier stages in the proceedings, the court had allocated the \nburden of proof to the defendants with respect to educational quality vestiges of segregation. See Coalition, 90 \nF.3d at 776. We see no reason, therefore, to alter in this case the traditional rule that the parties who have been \nfound to have violated the Constitution bear the burden of proving that the effects of their violations have been \neradicated to the extent practicable. \n \n16  The State was given every opportunity to provide such information, but has never done so. When data about these \n  four other school districts was first proffered to the Court, the following colloquy ensued: \nTHE COURT: I have looked at those graphs, and I have questions with respect to them. Are you planning to call \nthe proponent of those graphs? \nCOUNSEL: I wasn’t because ... he was saying this is what it is, but I will if the court has questions about them. \nTHE COURT: I don’t really know what they tell me. They compare findings in Yonkers with other communities. I \ndon’t know whether those other communities’ public school systems suffered from some of the discriminations \nwhich were operative in Yonkers. I don’t know that Yonkers is claiming that it is unique in American society.... \nCOUNSEL: [The proponent of those graphs] does not address that question. All he does is collect the \ninformation that is filed with him. \nTHE COURT: What is the [probative] value absent that? \nCOUNSEL: Because, your Honor, the point is Yonkers is claiming it has special needs because it had to share \ndesegregation.... [T]he graphs show ... communities where it has never been alleged they had segregation, the \ngaps are the same or larger. Yonkers— \nTHE COURT: But let me interrupt you. You say in communities in which it has never been alleged that there is \nracial discrimination? \nCOUNSEL: It has never been a determination, as far as I know, never been a court case involving the district, the \nentire districts that we have given you. \nTHE COURT: What does that tell me? What does that tell me with respect to the probative value of a \ncomparison of the communities? There have not been school desegregation cases in every community in the \nstate, to my knowledge, in which racial discrimination existed. In some instances, ... self-correction has been \nattempted. In some instances I think—I don’t know the situation has been address for whatever reason. \nCOUNSEL: .... A district cannot be presumed to have had segregation. That has to be something proved in the \ncase by the preponderance of the evidence, and it is not our burden to show that these districts have never \nhad—never been de jure segregated. \nTHE COURT: It is the burden at least of these graphs. \nCOUNSEL: All the graphs are doing is providing the information..... \nTHE COURT: ... [T]hat is not really a meaningful statement to say is all it is providing the information. What I’m \ntrying to explore with you is what the probative value of the information is. If I understand what you’re saying \nis that these charts show there are other school districts in the state in which there is not a court decree finding \nthat the school system is racially segregated, in which there are gaps between minority and non-minority \nstudent achievement—is that it? \nCOUNSEL: These are the school systems in the state, only school systems close to Yonkers in ethnicity and the \nethnicity of their students and Yonkers is—the minority students in Yonkers are in most cases doing better \ntha[n] the minority students in these other districts..... \nTHE COURT: All right. I understand what you’re saying. \n(1997 Trial Tr. at 8–12.) When the proponent of the graphs was called, he reported that he was merely \nsummarizing data filed with the state and had no other information about any of the four districts. (See id. at \n187–209 (Streeter).) To date, the State Defendants have never come forward with any information about these \nfour districts which might explain the probative value of the data they present. \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \n \n17  Moreover, while liability for segregation requires intentional segregative conduct, a finding that vestiges exist does \n  not. See Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 538, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979) (explaining that the \ninquiry with respect to vestiges focuses on “the effectiveness, not the purpose, of the [school district’s] actions”); \nbut cf. Yonkers VII, 197 F.3d at 52 (rejecting the possibility that the Yonkers curriculum might be a vestige of \nsegregation because “[t]here was no demonstration that those who drafted the curriculum in 1980 acted with racial \nanimus to craft a school program such that children of certain ethnicities or races would fail to learn, or that the \ncurriculum represented anything other than the pedagogical thinking of the time.”). \n \n18  Judicial experience with desegregating school districts belies the notion that a racial disparity in test scores can not \n  be remedied through court supervision. See Capacchione v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 57 F.Supp.2d 228, \n274 (W.D.N.C.1999) (noting that remedial measures had resulted in a seven-fold increase in black students’ \nenrollment in advanced placement courses, a greater percentage of black students being prepared for the next \ngrade level, and a reduction in the gap in achievement scores); Tasby v. Woolery, 869 F.Supp. 454, 476–77 \n(N.D.Tex.1994) (noting that court-ordered remedial measures had reduced the achievement gap from an average of \n20 points to an average of 10–14 points); United States v. Bd. of Educ. of Chicago, 588 F.Supp. 132, 163 (N.D.Ill.1984) \n(finding that gap had been narrowed through remedial program); see also John A. Powell, Living and Learning: \nLinking Housing and Education, 80 Minn.L.Rev. 749, 793 n. 132 (1996) (noting a 19–point reduction in the \nachievement gap in Dallas schools and a 17–point reduction in Louisville schools); see general id. at 788–89 (“In \ncities across the country the achievement gap between black students and white students narrowed considerably \nwith the implementation of school integration plans.”); Paul Gewirtz, Choice in the Transition: School Desegregation \nand the Corrective Ideal, 86 Colum.L.Rev. 728, 798 n. 75 (1986) (“Integration has been linked to a range of equality \ngoals: ... reducing achievement gaps between whites and blacks, especially educational achievement gaps.”). \n \n19  There is no evidence currently before the Court as to current practices or conditions in the YPS, from which we \n  might render a finding. In several places in the pages that follow we refer to circumstances using the present tense, \nbecause we do not wish to suggest that the practices we discuss no longer exist. It is expressly to be understood, \nhowever, that regardless of which tense is used, all findings of fact rendered herein relate to circumstances as they \nexisted in 1997. \n \n20  Because we further find that there are policies and practices in Yonkers that disproportionately impact minority \n  students and are traceable to the prior segregation, see infra Part III(B), we conclude that those policies and \npractices are vestiges of segregation. \n \n21  We might have added a fifth area about which the Court has received a great deal of evidence—the degree to which \n  students participate in a more rigorous, academic curriculum. As is set forth below, selection for advanced classes in \nYonkers is made, at least in part, on the basis of test scores and other measures of academic achievement. See Part \nIII(B)(1). Participation in those classes, therefore, seems like a measure of academic performance. However, we \nbelieve that the record establishes that a variety of factors, in addition to academic performance, influences \nwhether or not a student participates in a more demanding academic curriculum. See id. We therefore defer \ndiscussion of the issue until the portion of this opinion in which we discuss the policies and practices of the YPS with \nrespect to tracking. \n \n22  (See, e.g., 1993 Trial Tr. at 455–57 (Weinberger); State Proposed Findings at 11–12, 30; State Reply at 6, 11.) \n   \n23  The State Defendants’ incessant repetition of this argument makes particularly puzzling their failure to subject \n  evidence from the four comparison districts, upon which they seem to stake their entire defense, to a regression \nanalysis. There is not a single bit of evidence in the record about these four districts which might be consulted to \nexplain or analyze the “raw, gross, unanalyzed quantitative data” (State Reply at 11) urged upon the Court by the \nState Defendants. \n \n24  In 1996, due to a change in the MAT’s publication policies, the YPS stopped administering the MAT and began \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \n  administering the California Achievement Test (“CAT”) instead. (See 1997 YBE Ex. 4, at ¶ 13.) The switch does not \nalter our analysis, but where relevant, we note any significant differences between MAT scores and CAT scores. \n \n25  One could not infer from this statistic, however, that this trend reflects a failure on the part of the YPS, since many \n  of the students in the higher grades could be transferring in to the YPS. To evaluate whether the widening disparity \nin grade equivalents is due to failures in the YPS programs, it would be necessary to track a particular cohort of \nstudents as they progress through the school. The capability of conducting such an analysis was not available as of \nthe time of the 1993 or 1997 trials. (See 1993 Trial Tr. at 359–60, 363–64 (Weinberger).) \n \n26  The Defendants argue that using the “total battery” overstates the magnitude of the disparity. (See 1993 Trial Tr. at \n  453–54 (Weinberger).) Because the MAT is taken by all students, including LEP students, they argue that language \ndeficiencies account for a substantial portion of the disparity on the reading and language portions of the exam, but \ndo not have as significant effect on the mathematics portion of the exam. (See id.) Indeed, the disparity in grade \nequivalents is smaller on the mathematics portion of the MAT than it is on the reading and language portions. (See \n1993 Trial Tr. at 454–55 (Weinberger); 1993 YBE Ex. 5F.) It is not, however, non-existent. \n \n27  Beginning with the 1995–96 school year, the YPS switched from administering the MAT test to using the California \n  Achievement Test (“CAT”), because of a change in the MAT’s publication policy. (See 1997 YBE Ex. 4, at ¶ 13.) \nAlthough the CAT scores were more erratic than the MAT scores, the trend observed on the MAT scores (a widening \nof racial disparity from lower grades to higher grades), was also observed on the CAT. (See id. at ¶¶ 14–16 and Tab \n5.) \n \n28  The only students who are not required to take the PEP exam are “[s]pecial education students for which there is a \n  clinical and educational judgment that the test is not appropriate,” and LEP students who have not yet received 20 \nmonths of instruction in English. (1993 Trial Tr. at 367 (Weinberger).) \n \n29  For example, on the 1996–97 6th grade math test, the SRP was 23 questions out of 65(35%) and the mastery level \n  was 55 questions (85%). (See 1997 YBE Ex. 4, at ¶ 18.) \n \n30  The 1992 data, however, does not indicate the number of percentage of students who achieved mastery level. (See \n  1997 YBE Ex. 4, at Tab 6; 1993 YBE Ex. 6A.) \n \n31  In 1992, for example, only 6.9% of the white students failed to meet the SRP on the third grade math PEP, but 22% \n  of the Latino students and 19.1% of the African–American students failed. (See 1993 YBE Ex. 6B.) For the sixth grade \nmath test, the failure rate was 9.2% for white students, 22.1% for Latino students, and 24.5% for African–American \nstudents. (See id.) On the 1992 reading test, the third grade failure rates were 26.1% for white students, 53.5% of \nthe Latinos, and 44.9% of the African–Americans; the sixth grade rates were 14.5% of whites, 39.7% of Latinos and \n36.2% of African–Americans. (See id.) Minority students were approximately three to four times more likely to fail to \nmeet the SRP on the fifth grade writing test in 1992; only 4.1 % of the white students failed, as compared to 18.2% \nof the Latinos and 15.1 % of the African–Americans. (See ) \n \n32  The Defendants also contend that the disparities are not meaningful because they have not been subjected to a \n  regression analysis. This is true, but as we have noted, not persuasive. In addition, we note that in another portion \nof Dr. Weinberger’s testimony, he explained that the math portion of the PEP exam is provided in alternate \nlanguages, including Spanish, and that his analysis of those test results included the exams taken in the alternate \nlanguages. (See id. at 491–92 (Weinberger).) That the racial disparity in PEP scores was actually higher, on average, \nfor the math tests (which are available in alternate languages) than it was for the reading tests suggests to us that \nthe LEP status of some of the minority students does not provide a thorough explanation for the apparent disparity \nin PEP scores. \n \n33  This is also the portion of the opinion where the panel indicates, contrary to its earlier express assertion that the \n  burden of proof question was immaterial, that “[t]he burden of proof comes into play at this juncture.” Id. We agree \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \nthat one must consider the question of which party has what burden in connection with the state’s reference to \nscores outside Yonkers. We submit, however, that, at a minimum, the State has the burden of proffering evidence to \nshow that the out-of-Yonkers districts were truly comparable and had not in fact engaged in de jure segregation \nregardless of whether or not they were subject to a court finding on that subject. See supra at pp. 703–05. \n \n34  We do not suggest bad faith on the part of the State Defendants. The State does not mandate that all schools \n  administer the MAT (as it does with the PEP) and it is possible, therefore, that comparable MAT scores were not \navailable in the other districts. \n \n35  The SED penalizes school districts that have a dropout rate higher than 10%, which creates an incentive on the part \n  of  school  districts  to  under-report  the  number  of  dropouts  in  their  district.  (See  1993  Trial  Tr.  at  388–89 \n(Weinberger).) \n \n36  Overall, the dropout rate in the YPS declined consistently between 1987 and 1996, with an upward spike occurring \n  in 1992. These trends were consistent across all three racial/ethnic groups. \n \n37  That group was defined as “those in the high schools who are, by the credits that they have earned, moved forward \n  from 11th grade to 12th grade, and if, as of the beginning of the year.” (1993 Trial Tr. at 396 (Weinberger).) \n \n38  Moreover,  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  to  support  an  inference  that  the  uncounted  dropouts  are \n  disproportionately members of minority groups. If Dr. Weinberger’s characterization was intended to convey his \nbelief that the racial disparity in dropout rates is actually stronger than his data indicate, we disagree and do not so \nfind. \n \n39  The State urges us to reject this wholly plausible inference on the ground that it is “an untested assumption,” which \n  “has no evidentiary value.” (State Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact at J(11).) However, we believe this is an \ninference grounded in logic and analysis and does not, therefore require an evidentiary basis. \n \n40  The data reflected strikingly little upward or downward movement, staying consistent at approximately 55%, \n  between 1988 and 1996. (See id.) \n \n41  We are somewhat unsure as to the extent of the finding rendered by the Court of Appeals with respect to what it \n  called the “educational theory” vestige. Our review of the court’s discussion, and the evidence cited therein, \nconvinces us that it is limited to curricular changes, and the introduction of new pedagogical methods such as the \n“cooperative learning” technique which was the subject of a great deal of testimony in the 1993 trial. Since the \nNAACP’s discussion of ability grouping in the elementary schools is, in substance, a discussion of pedagogical \nmethods such as cooperative learning, the finding rendered by the remanding panel precludes this Court from \naddressing that putative vestige of segregation. By contrast, because academic tracking relates neither to the \ncurriculum nor to a pedagogical method, per se, we believe it is still open for us to consider whether a vestige of \nsegregation existed as of 1997 with respect to academic tracking. We don’t consider the policies or practices that \nthe NAACP refers to as “curricular inadequacies” and “inappropriate classroom practices” because we believe any \nfinding with respect to those practices is foreclosed by the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the record with respect \nto “educational theory” does not support a finding that those practices are vestiges of segregation. \n \n42  See supra note 17. \n   \n43  Donald Duncan, the director of Human Resources at the YPS, and a former New York City police officer, testified \n  about one occasion in which church officials in Yonkers approached him because their parishioners informed them \nthat public school teachers in the YPS had expectations of them that were too low. (See id. at 816.) Although this \ntestimony would be inadmissible hearsay if considered for its truth, it is admissible as evidence of the sources of this \nwitness’s understanding with respect to teacher expectations. \n \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \n44  For one explanation of the historical dynamic, consider the testimony of Lincoln High School principal, Bedelia Fries: \n  If you’ve only had to work with a very homogeneous clientele that is self-driven, self-motivated, upper middle \nclass or middle class parents who value education, most of them were college bound, basically kids who could \nteach themselves, if you’ve only taught that type of youngster for 10, 20, 30 years and suddenly you are \nworking with students who come from families where there is neglect, where education is perhaps not as \nvalued, where there are dysfunctional behavior exhibited, minority students that feel, for whatever reason \nright or wrong, that perhaps society hasn’t dealt them a fair hand and these kind of students now walk into \nyour classroom and you haven’t had any training or very little training, that’s going to be a tough, a tough thing \nto deal with. \n(Id. at 1038; see also id. at 1189 (Cardona–Zuckerman).) As of 1993, approximately 1200 of the 1600 teachers in \nthe YPS had worked there prior to 1986. (See id. at 1614–15 (Guerney).) \n \n45  Indeed, it is entirely unclear to this Court how a party could establish a vestige of segregation with respect to \n  educational quality without relying, at least in part, on anecdotal evidence. The only vestiges which might be proved \nwithout relying at all on such evidence would be the relatively objective and quantifiable factors identified by the \nCourt in Green. But, as we noted above, it is well established that the Green factors are not an exclusive list of \nfactors that might be vestiges of segregation. Given that to be the case, it seems to us to be necessary for anecdotal \nevidence to be permitted to support a finding that vestiges of segregation exist with respect to educational quality, \nmuch as anecdotal evidence is relied upon in other areas of the law concerning discrimination. \n \n46  By contrast, the State Defendants’ witnesses provided testimony about the lack of racism which could, equally, be \n  characterized as “anecdotal.” However, most of those witnesses had no experience whatsoever in the Yonkers \npublic schools. (See, e.g., 1849, 1855 (Adams).) Not a single one of those witnesses, however, has had a single day of \nexperience working in the Yonkers public schools. On balance, therefore, we credit the anecdotal evidence of those \nwho have a degree of familiarity and experience with local conditions over that of witnesses who have none. \n \n47  The  educational  merit  of  this  approach  is  the  subject  of  a  significant  controversy  among  educators  and \n  policymakers. See People Who Care, 111 F.3d at 536–37; Jack W. Londen, School Desegregation and Tracking: A Dual \nSystem Within Schools, 29 U.S.F.L.Rev. 705, 710 (1995) ( “[S]ubstantial educational research show[s] that tracking is \nharmful, particularly to students placed in low-track classrooms.”) (citations omitted); Kimberly C. West, Note, A \nDesegregation Tool that Backfired: Magnet Schools and Classroom Segregation, 103 Yale L.J. 2567, 2577–79 (1994). \nWe understand, and respect, that it is educators rather than a federal court that should resolve that controversy. \nOur treatment of this issue relates solely to the question of whether such a policy is consistent with the City and \nState Defendants’ duty to eradicate all vestiges of segregation in the YPS. That question is one as to which the Court \nis competent, and as to which judicial experience is relevant. \n \n48  The College Bound Study produced a lengthy report detailing academic tracking in the YPS and the causes thereof. \n  (See 1993 YBE Ex. 22.) While this report was the subject of a substantial amount of testimony during the 1993 trial, it \nwas not admitted for its truth, but rather to explain the bases for conclusions reached by various administrators. \n(See id. at 58 (Batista).) \n \n49  The Defendants challenge the accuracy of the conclusions reached in the College Bound study on the grounds that \n  defining students with high ability as those students who had scored at or above the 50th percentile on the MAT \nwas arbitrary, and that the study did not distinguish among students within that broadly-defined category. (See \n1993 Trial Tr. at 493–94 (Weinberger).) While these criticisms appear, to us, to be valid criticisms of the College \nBound study and its conclusions, they do not effect the validity of the underlying data prepared by Dr. Weinberger. \n \n50  This result is, of course, not surprising in light of our finding about the achievement gap. See supra Part III(A) & \n  Appendix A. \n \n51  “Kids are so sensitive, so honest, and they can smell attitudes on the part of adults toward them. Yeah, when I \n  encounter youngsters in the halls and [ask] why aren’t you in class if they’re cutting, well, that teacher, and then you \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \nget the student’s version of what’s not happening in the classroom. Often times it is an issue, what I would call low \nexpectation, the child may not call it that but I would view it as that.” (1993 Trial Tr. at 1047 (Fries).) The YBE did not, \nhowever, present any quantitative evidence of minority students’ self-esteem. (See id. 177, 234–39 (Batista), 706 \n(Pack), 833 (Duncan).) \n \n52  Dr. Batista testified that, as a guidance counselor during that period, he routinely was encouraged to steer minority \n  students towards that curriculum. (See id. at 18, 72 (Batista).) \n \n53  Ms. Fries also testified that some non-minority teachers are more confrontational with minority students than they \n  are with non-minority students. (See id. at 1037.) However, she testified that other non-minority teachers felt \nthreatened by minority students and were, therefore, less likely to confront them. (See id. at 1035.) \n \n54  Dr. Cox testified that the basis for her judgment with respect to suspensions was the review she conducts of reports \n  prepared from superintendent’s hearings, in the course of determining an appropriate placement for the child upon \ntheir return to school. (See id. at 1751.) \n \n55  The data presented with respect to suspensions reports the total number of suspensions, which, of course, is \n  greater than the total number of students suspended because some students are suspended more than once. (See \n1997 YBE Ex. 4, at ¶ 22; 1993 Trial Tr. at 373 (Weinberger).) To account for this, Dr. Weinberger also presented data \non the total number of students suspended. The results, with respect to the proportion of minority students \nsuspended were roughly the same regardless of which measurement technique was used. (See 1997 YBE Ex. 4, at ¶ \n22 & Tab 9.) \n \n56  (See also 1993 Trial Tr. at 1681–82(Cox) (testifying that, in her experience as a counselor working with students who \n  have been suspended pursuant to a superintendent’s hearing, “[a]n overwhelming number of the children are Afro \nAmerican males”).) \n \n57  The disproportion was of a similar magnitude for junior high and elementary school students, but the absolute \n  numbers were slightly lower. (See id.) \n \n58  As with the disproportionate rate at which minority students were subject to discipline, the overall data represents \n  a smaller disparity than it would if it desegregated students by gender. (See id. at 1699–1703(Cox)). \n \n59  Moreover, if one were to focus solely on African–American and Latino males, the disproportion would be even more \n  pronounced. (See 1993 Trial Tr. at 381–83 (Weinberger); 1993 YBE Ex. 25.) African–American and Latino males were \nreferred for special education at a much more disproportionate rate than were African–American and Latino \nfemales, who were not referred at a noticeably disproportionate rate. The overall figures described above, \ntherefore, are averages that are brought down somewhat by the inclusion of both genders. \n \n60  According to Dr. Cox, many students who are referred, but not placed are stigmatized by the experience and are the \n  subject of extremely low expectations on the part of the staff. (See id. at 1761–62.) \n \n61  And, of course, if it should ultimately be concluded by the appellate courts that no vestiges exist, current conditions \n  will impact on whether the YBE will be found to have demonstrated the good faith required to warrant a finding of \nunitary status. \n \n1  “Regression analysis is a statistical method that permits analysis of a group of variables simultaneously as part of an \n  attempt to explain a particular phenomenon .... The method attempts to isolate the effects of various factors on the \nphenomenon.” James v. Stockham Valves and Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 332 (5th Cir.1977). \n \n2  Dr. Braddock also testified that he reviewed many of the numerous court documents that this case has generated, \n  including this Court’s opinion with respect to the YBE’s and the City’s liability for intentional segregation, see Yonkers \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \nI, to develop a sense of the case’s history and background (see id. at 1366). \n \n3  A similar notation system is used to denote other degrees of statistical significance. p<.01 signifies that the \n  correlation would occur by chance less than once in one hundred occurrences; p<.05 signifies one in twenty. A \ncorrelation is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring randomly is less than or equal to the p<.05 level. See \nSmith v. Xerox, 196 F.3d 358, 365–66 (2d Cir.1999) (citing Waisome v. Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, 948 \nF.2d 1370, 1376 (2d Cir.1991)) (explaining that statistical significance of at least p<.05 can be adequate to establish \nprima facie case of disparate impact under Title VII). \n \n4  The correlation between race and achievement scores on the reading test was greater than the correlation on the \n  math test. It accounted for approximately 12% of the variance on the reading test, but only 10% of the variance on \nthe math test. It seems plausible that this trend is due to the disproportionately high number of LEP students who \nare minorities. Because performance on the reading test is, presumably, more significantly affected by one’s \nlanguage ability than is performance on the math test, the disproportionate number of LEP students who are \nminorities might account for their being a seemingly larger race effect on the reading test than on the math test. \nThis hypothesis is partially confirmed by disaggregating the disparity between white and African–American scores \nfrom the disparity between Latino and white scores. The average disparity between African–American scores and \nwhite scores was 28.25 (28.7 on reading and 27.8 on math). For Latinos, the disparity with white scores was 32.2 \n(37.45 on reading and 26.95 on math). When student background, including LEP status, was taken into account, the \ndisparity between white scores and African–American scores dropped to 24.14 (24.03 on reading and 24.26 on \nmath), but the disparity between white and Latino scores dropped to only 13.95 (15.35 on reading and 12.56 on \nmath). \n \n5  For example, the first control variable considered was student background. When that variable was included, Dr. \n  Braddock did not report the correlation between test scores and student background alone; he reported the \ncorrelation between test scores and the entire set of independent variables that had been included up to that point \n(i.e., race and student background). When the next independent variable was included, prior test score, the \nreported correlation was between test scores and all the independent variables included up to that point (i.e., race, \nstudent background, and prior test scores). Finally, when the last independent variable was included (school \ncharacteristics), the reported correlation is that which was observed between test scores and all the independent \nvariables (i.e., race, student background, prior test scores, and school characteristics). \n \n6  For example, when Dr. Braddock included school characteristics in his model, the size of the overall disparity for \n  1990–91 seventh grade math scores increased from 11.810 to 14.148 (for African–Americans) and from 6.148 to \n7.457 (for Latinos). A similar pattern can be seen with respect to the 1990–91 eighth grade math scores, almost all \nof the 1991–92 reading scores, and many of the 1991–92 math scores. \n \n7  Including student background as a control variable had a more noticeable effect on the disparity between the scores \n  of Latino students and white students than it did on the disparity between African–American students’ scores and \nwhite students’ scores. Of the nine comparisons in which the degree of significance dropped from p<.001 to p<.01, 7 \ninvolved comparisons between Latino scores and white scores. \n \n8  “The best predictor of student performance on some academic outcome is how they have performed previously on \n  that same academic outcome.... [T]hat’s the reasoning behind using grades and tests for selection into college \nprograms.” (Trial Tr. at 1383 (Braddock).) Accordingly, “[h]aving a measure of prior performance and finding an \neffect of either factors over and above the effect of prior performance on an achievement outcome is strong \nevidence of the veracity of that effect.” (Id.) \n \n9  Consideration of prior test scores had a more substantial effect in the later grades than it did in the earlier grades. \n  Of the 24 comparisons made for students in grades 1–3, the disparity in minority achievement scores remained at \nleast at the .01 level for all but 5, consisting primarily of the comparison of white and Latino scores on the math test. \nOf the 24 comparisons made in grades 4–6, only 12 remained at the .01 level or higher. And, of the 24 comparisons \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \nmade for grades 7–9, only 7 were at the .01 level or higher. \n \n10  Those two comparisons were the comparison of African–American students’ scores and white students’ scores on \n  the 1990–91 first grade math test and on the 1991–92 third grade math test. With respect to both of these \ncomparisons, inclusion of school characteristics reduced the degree of significance of the disparity from p<.001 to \np<.01. \n \n11  There was a greater degree of disparity between African–American students’ scores and white students’ scores, \n  which was statistically significant for all 36 comparisons, than there was between white students’ scores and Latino \nstudents’ scores, which was only statistically significant for 18 of the 36 comparisons. \n \n12  When no controls were used, African–American students also seemed to have scored higher than Latino students on \n  the reading and language tests. \n \n13  A degree of bias was thereby introduced into his study, because, as Dr. Rindskopf acknowledged, minority students \n  are disproportionately of LEP status and are disproportionately enrolled in special education programs. In fact, \nspecifically in the six census tracts he examined, exclusion of LEP students amounted to an exclusion of ⅓ of all the \nLatino students (the lowest performing 1/3) (see id. at 2033–34 (Rindskopf)), but less than 1% of the white students \nand 8–9 % of the non-minorities. (See id. at 2032 (Rindskopf).) \n \n14  The Latino students, however, scored higher than the African–American students on many of the tests, suggesting \n  that LEP status was an important factor in causing the unadjusted scores of Latino students to be lower than the \nunadjusted scores of African–American students. \n \n15  Dr. Rindskopf defined socioeconomic status as consisting of “income, education and occupation.” (Tr. at 2061.) \n  Census tracts do not seem to provide any useful information about any of those three items. (See id.) \n \n16  Census tracts were used, as opposed, for example, to postal zip code, because they describe a much more \n  circumscribed geographical area. (See 1993 Trial Tr. at 1999 (Rindskopf).) \n \n17  The authority for this conclusion comes from experience with commercial marketing, in which products are \n  marketed according to census tract. (See Trial Tr. at 2092 (Rindskopf).) \n \n18  As Dr. Rindskopf described it: “Past research has shown that within a census tract, people are more alike on a lot of \n  different characteristics than would be two people from different census tracts. So that census tract is being used as \na geographic control.” (Trial Tr. at 2062.) Dr. Rindskopf explained that he did not know one way or another whether \nthe six census tracts he studied controlled for the traditional SES factors. (See id. at 2064.) \n \n19  Dr. Rindskopf was clear, however, that a census tract is not a proxy for income (see Trial Tr. at 2059 (Rindskopf)); Dr. \n  Rindskopf acknowledged that, at least with respect to a poor person’s income (which was his focus in this study), \nparticipation in a subsidized lunch program is a better measure of an individual family’s income than is the census \ntract in which he lives. (See Trial Tr. at 2042.) Moreover, as Dr. Rindskopf acknowledged, there is substantial \nvariation in income within any given census tract. (See Trial Tr. at 2043–47 (Rindskopf).) \n \n20  Each of the six census tracts that Dr. Rindskopf utilized is located in Southwest Yonkers. (See Trial Tr. at 2058 \n  (Rindskopf).) \n \n21  A statistically significant disparity was still observed between African–American and Latino students. \n   \n22  The use of that control variable is somewhat analogous to the frequently litigated issue in the employment context \n  as to whether the relevant sample is the entire minority population, or just the pool of qualified minority applicants. \n[W]here the issue is not present discrimination but rather whether past discrimination has resulted in the \n \n\nU.S. v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 123 F.Supp.2d 694 (2000)   \n149 Ed. Law Rep. 721 \n \ncontinuing exclusion of minorities from a historically tight-knit industry, a contrast between population and \nwork force is entirely appropriate to help gauge the degree of the exclusion. In Johnson v. Transportation \nAgency, Santa Clara County, [480 U.S. 616, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987) ], Justice O’Connor specifically \nobserved that, when it is alleged that discrimination has prevented blacks from ‘obtaining th[e] experience’ \nneeded to qualify for a position, the ‘relevant comparison’ is not to the percentage of blacks in the pool of \nunqualified candidates, but to ‘the total percentage of blacks in the labor force. Id. at 651, 107 S.Ct. 1442; see \nalso Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 198–99 and n. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979); Teamsters, 431 \nU.S. at 339 n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 1843. \nCity of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 541, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (Marshall, J., dissenting); see \nalso E.C. Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (finding total population, \nrather than pool of qualified applicants, to be relevant sample because “[t]he application process might itself not \nadequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool, since otherwise qualified people might be discouraged \nfrom  applying  because  of  a  self-recognized  inability  to  meet  the  very  standards  challenged  as  being \ndiscriminatory”). Similarly, here, where the issue is whether lingering effects of discrimination exist, to control for \nstudents with low prior test scores is tantamount to excluding those who have already been the victims of the \nprior discrimination. \n \n23  “Even if the line were correctly chosen, the black students eligible for free lunches could be on average significantly \n  poorer than the white students eligible for them; they could be further below the poverty line, and this could make \na difference in their educational achievement.” Id. \n \n24  Any  review  of  pertinent  caselaw  quickly  confirms  the  accuracy  of  this  testimony.  See,  e.g.,  Capacchione  v. \n  Charlotte–Mecklenburg Schs., 57 F.Supp.2d at 275; Manning v. Sch. Bd., 24 F.Supp.2d 1277, 1323 (M.D.Fla.1998); \nReed v. Rhodes, 1 F.Supp.2d 705, 739 (N.D.Ohio 1998); Tasby v. Woolery, 869 F.Supp. at 477. According to Dr. \nBraddock, participation in a subsidized lunch program was even used as a proxy for socioeconomic status in a \nCongressional Reauthorization of Chapter I funding. (See id. at 1380.) \n \n25  Even the City’s statistical expert, Dr. Steinberg, concluded that Dr. Braddock’s study was as complete as it could have \n  been, given the data available. (See Trial Tr. at 2146 (Steinberg).) \n \n26  This problem was magnified by Dr. Rindskopf’s use of unweighted means across the six tracts to determine \n  aggregate scores. In determining the mean score for each race for the six tracts, in the aggregate, Dr. Rindskopf \nsimply averaged the six mean scores that he found for each of the six tracts, weighting them all equally. In some of \nthe tracts, however, as few as 7 students were considered; their scores were weighted equivalently to other tracts \nin which 23 students were considered. Dr. Rindskopf justified this approach on the ground that the six tracts were \nrelatively homogeneous—one implication of which is that it makes little sense to differentiate among the six tracts. \nIt would seem to make little sense therefore to aggregate the scores for the six tracts by differentiating the mean for \neach of the tracts and then computing a weighted average for all of them. (See generally Trial Tr. at 2067–74 \n(Rindskopf).) \n \n27  The white students in the six census tracts with which Dr. Rindskopf worked are significantly less well off than white \n  students, on average, in the City of Yonkers. (See Trial Tr. at 2041 (Rindskopf).) Relative to African–American and \nLatino families in the other 43 census tracts, those in the six tracts studied were at average levels of poverty. The six \ncensus tracts examined, then, can be characterized as ones including “poor whites with average blacks in Hispanic \nneighborhoods.” (See Trial Tr. at 2041 (Rindskopf).) \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

To  the  contrary,  in  1968,  the  Board \ndecided to add the fourth, fifth and sixth grade students \nfrom School 9 to the King feeder pattern, thus adding an \nintegrative component to the already unique intermediate \ngrade structure of the school. \n  \nThe drawing of the original boundary lines for the King \nschool  was  an  issue  of  considerable  dispute  at  trial. \nAccording to the proffered testimony of Rabbi Abraham \nKlausner, a leader of the Clergy of Yonkers’ Education \nCommittee who lived in the School 16 area, the Board \noriginally planned to draw the King attendance zone so as \nto include a virtually all-white three-block area of the \nSchool 16 (0% minority in 1967–68) zone which, several \nyears earlier, had been rezoned from the School 25 (41% \nminority  in  1967–68)  zone.  See  SCHOOLS  IV.A.4.a \ninfra. According to Klausner, the plan to include this \nso-called “dogleg” area of the School 16 zone in the King \nfeeder pattern (by including it in School 9’s attendance \nzone) was strongly opposed by residents of the School 16 \narea, who did not want to be reassigned from highly \nregarded (and identifiably white) School 16 to King, a \nschool which was already being perceived by community \nmembers as an educationally inferior minority school.

In  any  event,  objective \n  evidence weighs against the feasibility of such a proposal: \nin 1969 King enrolled 701 students, or 93% capacity, and \nby the following year, was at 102% capacity. In addition, \nin  1970,  after  community  members  urged  the  school \nadministration  to  consider  including  a  portion  of  the \nSchool 16 dogleg area in the School 9 zone, the district in \nfact reassigned students from this area to School 9, which \nin turn fed into King and thereby raised King’s white \nenrollment from 43% to 51%. The rezoned area included \nthe area surrounding North Broadway and High Street, \nthe same area which residents of the School 9 community \nhad urged school officials to include in the King feeder \nzone.

The Court \nissued a decision finding liability on November 20, 1985.  The Court ~ntered the \nHousing  Remedy  Order  (\"HRO\")  on  May  28,  1986.  The  HRO  provided \n· injunctive and other relief against the defendants. \n2.  The Court entered the First Remedial Consent Decree in Equity on January \n28, 1988, providing more detailed requirements for implementing the HRO. \n3.  On June 13, 1988, the Court entered the Long Term Plan Order (\"LTPO\"), \nestablishing more detailed requirements for implementing the HRO and the First \nRemedial Consent Decree in Equity. \n4.  On September 9,  1988, the Affordable Housing Ordinance (\"AHO\") was \n1 A more complete history of the action and its housing portion can be found in the many judicial decisions \nwhich have been rendered. \n5 \n\nadopted by the City.  The City has maintained the AHO since its adoption and, on \nseveral  occasions  with  Court  authorization,  adopted  amendments  and  granted \nwaivers with respect to specific applications. \n5.  The Court entered the Supplemental Long Term Plan Order (\"SLTPO\") on \nOctober 5,  1993, establishing more detailed requirements  for  implementing the \nHRO, the First Remedial Consent Decree in Equity and the LTPO. \n6.  On November 6,  1996, the Court entered the Second Supplemental Long \nTerm Plan Order (\"SSL TPO\").  That order stated in part:  \"The City of Yonkers \nhas committed itself to  undertake implementation of the SLTPO and LTPO, as \nl \namended. herein, in good faith and has asked· in return that primary responsibility \nfor the creation of affordable housing pursuant to these plans,  as  modified,  be \nvested  in  the  City  .  .  .\"  The  SSL TPO  gave  the  City  responsibility  for \nimplementation of the Court's remedial orders subject to monitoring by the Court \nand  the  plaintiffs,  reserving jurisdiction  of the  Court  to  intervene  and  further \nmodify the order if its goals were not achieved within the designated time periods. \nParagraph  2  of the  SSL TPO  stated  that  \"for  each  of the  six  calendar  years \ncommencing January 1,  1997, the City of Yonkers agrees that it shall provide at \nleast 100 units of affordable housing to L TPO-qualified individuals.  In providing \nsaid units,  the  City shall  rely upon  existing. housing and/or new construction.\" \nUnder the terms of the SSLTPO, the City would be deemed to_ have achieved all of \nthe requirements of the  1988 consent decree, LTPO, SLTPO and Part VI of the \nHRO by providing the 600 affordable housing units as defined in paragraph 2 of \n6 \n\nthe  order  and  the  Cross  Street,  Hoover  Road,  and  Yonkers  Av enue  new \nconstruction units described in paragraph I of the SSLTPO.  Pursuant to \nparagr~ph \n4 of the SSLTPO, the Grassy Sprain site was designated for the development of 34 \nunits. of housing.  The Court noted that these provisions had been negotiated and \nagreed to  by the parties  to  implement remaining aspects  of the HRO  and the \nLTPO. \n7.  On  December  I,  1998,  the New  York  Urban Development Corporation \n(\"UDC\"), doing business as the Empire State Development Corporation (\"ESDC\") \nentered a settlement agreement,that resolved all housing claims involving the State \n1 \ndefendants. \n8.  On December 9,  1999, the  Court entered the. Third  Supplemental Long \nTerm Plan Order (\"Third SLTPO\").  Among other things, the 600 unit goal of the \nSSLTPO was converted to a 600 credit goal. \n9.  On July 7, 2003, the Court entered the Fourth Supplemental Long Term \nPlan Order (\"Fourth SL TPO\"). \n10.  Pursuant to  the provisions  of the foregoing orders,  the  defendants  have \ncompleted their court-ordered obligations to enact the AHO, provide sites for 200 \nunits of scattered site public housing in east Yonkers, to provide the required new \nconstruction  of mixed-income  housing  and  to  facilitate  an  assisted  existing \nhousing  program  that  has  provided  600  credits  of LT  PO  assisted  housing  in \nYonkers  by  making  initial  placements  of  eligible  persons  into  affordable \ndesegregative housing  units.  As  required by the  LTPO  and AHO,  that newly \n7 \n\nconstructed housing and pool of assisted existing housing opportunities requires \nongoing oversight, management and support by the Yonkers Affordable Housing \nDepartment (\"YA  HD\") for various lengths of time to ensure that affordability and \nother program standards are maintained. \nC.  Recitals as to the Settlement Itself \n1.  Now, noting the litigation history in this case recited above, and with due \n. ·and careful consideration, the parties have decided to enter into this Agreement to \nensure  that  the  benefits  of ~he housing  remedy  are  maintained  foliowing ·the \nterniination of the litigation, tq serve the interests of the class in receiving equal \ni \nhousing opportunities, and to serve the public policy interests in restoring local \ncontrol of assisted housing in Yonkers. \n2.  The parties believe that this Agreement carefully balances dismissal, on th~ \nEffective Date, of the housing claims and return to local control with continued \nmaintenance  of the  assisted  housing  created  by  the  City  and provides  a  fair \nexchange of valuable. consideration by and to all the parties.  The parties recognize \nthe  City's  good  faith  intent  not  to  engage  in  unlawful  residential  housing \nsegregation.  The  parties  also  acknowledge  to  each  other  that  the  City's \nimplementation  of the  housing  programs  described  in  Attachment  A  further \ndemonstrates the City's good faith. \n3.  The parties believe that this Agreement is  a fair,  lawful, and appropriate \nfinal resolution of all outstanding housing issues in this litigation and shall work \ntogether to seek prompt Court approval of the Agreement. \n8 \n\n4.  The parties have concluded that this Agreement provides an ·adequate and \nproper basis for dismissal of the housi:ng action with prejudice on the Effective \nDate, the return of housing to local control, and the termination of the housing \naction  with· prejudice,  provided  the  Court  retains  limited  ancillary jurisdiction \nunder Kokkonen  to  ensure  that  the  City  abides  by its  obligations  under  this \nAgreement. \nII.

They \nare the following: \n1.  Purchase Assistance Program:  Through its downpayment and closing cost \nassistance program, the  City has  assisted approximately 300 households to \npurchase homes (single family, two family, condos, and coops) in East and \nNorthwest  Yonkers  since  1997.  As  required by the  Order,  the  City. has \nrestricted the resale price and occupancy of these homes for 30 years through \ndeed  restrictions,  UCC-ls,. and/or  second  mortgages  or  loan  security \nagreements.  (Section 4(b) of the LTPO provides that \"All assisted housing \nunits  subject  to  purchase  sh~!.ll  have  resale-price  limitations· (enforced  by \ncovenants running with the land, restrictiops on registration of title, or any \nother appropriate legaJ mechanism approved by' the City) which will ensure \nthat for a period of thlrty years from the time of their first sale such housing \nunits are sold or resold only to, ·and at a price affordable to, a household which \nis, at the time of purchase, in the same income group, as was the seller at the \ntime such previous owner first occupied the unit.)  The owner must occupy the \npremises as his primary residence and also obtain approval of refinancings, \nhome equity loans and home equity lines of credits.  Depending on the date of \ntransfer oftitle, these restrictions will be in effect through 2027 to 2036. \nThe  resa~e restrictions  have  and  will  continue  to  be  monitored  in  the \nfollowing ways: \na.  Promissory Note and Second Mortgage (UCC-1,  Promissory Note,  and \nLoan  Security  Agreement  in  the  case  of coops)  for  initial  purchases \nbetween  1997  and  2002.  The  documents  contained  the  following \nprOVISIOnS: \n\" ... this Mortgage and the Note it secures shall be fully assumable by any \nsubsequent  qualified  purchaser  of  the  Premises  provided  that  said \nsubsequent purchaser has been properly qualified to purchase the premises \nunder the provisions of the Long Term Plan Order (\"LTPO\").  Said Order \nprovides,  in  part,  that  the  Premises  is  subject  to  resale  restrictions \nrequiring that the Premises be sold at a price that is affordable to a person \nin the same income bracket as  the Borrower at the time of Borrower's \npurchase.  Written notice of such approval must be  obtained from  the \nLender or the current administrator of the LTPO ... \" \n1 \n\n\"THE  BORROWER  COVENANTS  AND  AGREES  THAT,  FOR  A \nPERIOD OF THIRTY (30) YEARS FROM THE DATE FIRST STATED \nABOVE,  THE  PREMISES  SHOULD  ONLY  BE  SOLD  TO  AND \nOCCUPIED  BY  A  FAMILY  QUALIFIED  BY  THE  CITY  OF \nYONKERS (OR ITS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST) WITH AN INCOME \nIN THE RANGE OF  % OF THE 'WESTCHESTER COUNTY \nMEDIA]\\l  INCOME  AS  DETERMTh!'ED  BY  RULES  AND \nGUIDELINES  OF  THE  CITY  OF  YO:N¥£RS  AFFORDABLE \nHOUSING DEPARTMENT.  THE PREMISES MAY ONLY BE SOLD \nAT  A  PRICE  WHICH  IS  AFFORDABLE  TO  SAID  PROPERLY \nQUALIFIED PlJRCHASERS,  THIS COVENANT SHALL RUN WITH \nTHE LAND AND  SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE BY THE CITY OF \nYONKERS, THE UNITED STATES OR THE FEDERAL COURT IN \nTHE CASE OF United States v. Yonkers, 80 CIV 6761 (LBS) (S.D.N.Y)\" \nTo eomply with this re-sale requirement,  the maximwn resale price is \ndetermined by evaluating the profile of the initial purchaser, i.e., the size \nof his/her household, ar.nount of his/her downpayment, and the percentage \nof median houseHold income adjusted to achieve a reasonable band of \naffordability.  From this profile, the Y AHD determines the price of a \nhome that this household could afford at the time of the sale and then \napplies an interest rate for affordable fixed rate mortgage products slightly \nhigher  than  the  current  rate  for  a  safety margin.  The  Y AHD  also \nconsiders the amount that the subsequent purchaser would pay for today1:s \nreal estate taxes, homeowner's insurance, private mortgage insurance, if \napplicable, and condo or coop fees, if applicable.  Y AHD then adds the \nmortgage amount to the downpayment amount and to the City of Yonkers \nmortgage  that  the  subsequent purchaser will  assume  to  determine  the \nmaximum sale price.  Y AHD will continue to utilize this process. \nb.  Restrictive Covenant, Promissory Note & Mortgage (UCCl, Promissory \nNote and Loan Security Agreement in the case of coops).  In 2003, the \nCity of Yonkers mortgage was revised and a restrictive covenant added. \nThe Borrower covenants and agrees that, for a period of thirty (30) years \nfrom the date first stated above, the premises shall only be sold to  and \noccupied by a family qualified by the City of Yonkers (or its successor in \ninterest) with an income in the range of  % of the Westchester \nCounty median income as determined by rules and guidelines of the City \nof Yonkers Affordable Housing Department.  The premises may only be \nsold at a price as determined and approved by the City of Yonkers (or its \nsuccessor  in  interest).  In order  to  keep  the  premises  affordable,  the \npremises may not be sold,  within 30 years for a price higher than the \n\"Maximum Resale Price\".  The Maximum Resale Price will equal the sum \nofthe following:  · \n2 \n\n(i)  The  Net  Purchase  Price  (i.e.  Gross  Sale  Price  niinus \nSubsidies) paid for the premises by the selling homeowner, \nincreased by the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer \nPrice Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers in \nthe New York - Northern New Jersey Area, as published by \nthe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (the \"Index\"), \nbetween (a) the month that was two months earlier than the \ndate on which the seller acquired the premises; and (b) the \nmonth that is two months earlier than the month in which the \nseller contracts  to  sell  the  premises.  If the  Bureau  stops \npublishing  this  index,  and  fails  to  designate  a  successor \n. index, the City of Yonlcers will designate a substitute index; \nand \n(i.i)  The  cost  of major  capital  improvements  made  by  the \nborrower when he owned.  the home as  evidenced by paid \nreceipts depredated on a straight line basis over a 15  year \nperiod from the date of completion.  · \nIn order to assure that these properties remain affordable. refinancings, \nhome equity loans and other secured !mancings are limited.  The City \nof Yo nl<:ers will agree to subordinate its mortgage loan position in limited \ncircumstances: \na.  for lower interest rates and shorter loan terrhs; \nb.  for approved property improvements; and \nc.  for hardship situations. \nEach request is and will continue to be reviewed on a case by case basis. \nThe  review  is  focused  on  assuring  that  the  home  will  remain  in  the \naffordable housing stock resulting from the LTPO.  Factors considered are \ncombined loan to  value ratios,  maintenance of housing ratios  at 33/38, \nowner's credit history, the need for and whether the proposed property \nimprovements  will  extend the  useful  life  of the  building,  and  whether \nincreased debt on the property will affect its affordability to subsequent \npurchasers. \nIn order to assure that these properties are the primary residence of the \nqualified purchasers, a certified letter with a \"Return Address Correction \nRequested\" will be sent armually requiring the owners to certify that they \nare residing at the address for which the City provided the assistance.  The \nletter will also include the procedures for resale of homes.  They will be \nrequired to notify YA  HD of their intent to sell.  YA  HD will advise them \nof the maximum resale price of their homes  and refer income  eligible \nhouseholds  from  its  waiting  list  by  priority.  YA  HD  will  assist  the \nprospective purchasers through the sale and mortgage processes. \n3 \n\n2.  Purchase Assistance  Pre-1997.  In addition  to  the  300± units  described \nabove, the City will continue to monitor the resale and occupancy restrictions \nof the  10  units purchased during  1995  and  1996  under the Fair Housing \nImplementation Office's maintenance of the list of eligible LTPO households. \nThese have mortgage restrictions similar to  the hom,es  secured by the City \nbetween 1997 and 2002. \n3.  New Construction Homeownershlp Developments.  The City will continue \nto  be  responsible  for.  monitoring  the  resale,  refinancing,  and  occupancy \nrestrictions ofthe following three LTPO projects totaling 33 units: \n•  Cross Street Condominiums - 11 affordable units \n•  Hoover Road Townhomes - 5 affordable units \n•  Sprain Lake Estates - '17 affordable units \nThe initial closings for the Cross Street Condominiums took place in 2001 and \nare controlled through a deed restriction and the pre-2003 mortgage and note. \nThe Hoover Road ToWnhomes closed in 2005 with deed restrictions and post \n2002 mortgages and notes.  We anticipate closings on the Sprain Lake Estates \nin the spring of 2007 with deed restrictions and post 2002. mortgages and \nnotes. \n4.  Other Homeownership Developments.  Additional LTPO homeownership \nopportunities will continue to be provided through: \na.  Small Sites Program - A total of  4 units - 2 on Sheibourne and 2 on \nWestminister with deed restrictions and post 2002 mortgages and notes. \nb.  Affordable Housing Ordinance - AHO  projects  are  developed through \nprivate sector initiatives.  The City expects the following two projects are \nto be completed in the near future: \nRiver Club-35 affordable units \nRidge Hill - 50 affordable units \nAHO  units  will  be  restricted  for  30  years  with  deed  restrictions  and \nmortgages and notes . \n. 5.  Rental  Assistance  Program:  The  City  effectively  launched  its  Rental \nAssistance Program in 2002.  The City provides financial assistance to eligible \nLTPO  households  who  lease  units  in  Yonkers  located  north of Glenwood \nAvenue or east of the Saw Mill River Parkway in census blocks with a Black \nand  Hispanic  concentration  of less  than  45%  or  elsewhere  in  Westchester \nCounty in census blocks with a Black and Hispanic concentration ofless than \n45%.  The financial  assistance provided includes subsidizing the difference \n4 \n\nbetween 30% of the household's income and the market rent, one-half the \nsecurity  deposit,  and  a  broker  or  landlord  incentive  fee  if  applicable. \nApproximately 200 households currently receive rental assistance.  The City \nmaintains its credit so long as the household continues to receive assistance for \na 10 year period.  If a household no longer participates in the program or is no \nlonger. eligible to participate, the City is obligated to assist another household \nfor the balance of the  10  year term.  The monitoring requirement will  end \nbetween 2012 and 2016. \n6.  New  Construction  Rental  Development:  St.  James  Gardens  includes  32 \naffordable rental units.  By deed restriction and regulatory agreement, the owner \nis responsible for maintaining these one, two and three bedroom units at rents \naffordable to different income categori.es and occupancy by eligible households \nfor 30  years  from  the  date of initial occupancy.  Units were initially leased \nbetween August, 2002 and May, 2003.  The owner is responsible for annual \nreports  certifying to  rent  levels  and  occupancy.  When LTPO . units  become \navailable, the Yonkers Affordable Housing Office will continue to refer qualified \nrenters. \n7.  Hudson View Terrace:  By restrictive covenant dated April20, 1998, the owner \nis required to rent 10 units at affordable rents and occupy those units with LTPO \nqualified households.  The rents  vary depending on income category served. \nPursuant to an agreement reached with the owner dated January 31, 2005, the 30 \nyear  affordability requirement  will  commence  on 9  of the  10  units  upon  a \ndetermination by the Yonkers Affordable Housing Office that the rent level and \noccupancy comply with the LTPO.  The lOth unit has been in compliance since \n1998.  The City's monitoring responsibility will run through 2035 or 2036. \n8.  Purchase Assistance  Program  involving  Two Family  Homes:  As  stated \nabove,  the  Purchase  Assistance  Program  enabled  some  LTPO  qualified \nhouseholds to purchase two family homes.  In some cases  (depending on the \namount of assistance provided), the rental units in these two family homes were \nrestricted  for  a  30  year period - to  be rented  at  a  certain  rent  with  annual \nincreases based on the Annual Adjustment Factor to LTPO qualified households \nwithin a certain income category.  The City's monitoring responsibility will run \nthrough 2036 and includes qualifying renters upon turnover,  reviewing leases, \nand obtaining an annual certification from the owner that an eligible tenant is \nresiding in the unit.  This applies to approximately 12 units. \n9.  Affordable  Housing  Ordinance:  The  two  approved  AHO  (in  addition  to \nHudson View Terrace described above) projects are the Millenium on Warburton \nAvenue with 10 affordable units (construction has been delayed for several years) \nand  1465  Midland  A venue  with  two  units  (construction  is  underway  and  is \nexpected  to  be completed  in  Spring,  2007).  A  site  plan  for  the Ridge  Hill \ndevelopment has been approved.  Assuming developer completion ofthe projects \n5 \n\nas previously approved, AHO units will be deed restricted for 30 years and will be \nmonitored in the same fashion as Hudson View Terrace. \nIn summary, the City will be responsible for monitoring the LTPO affordability \nand requirements for 425 ± ownership units· for a 30 year period.  The 30 year \nperiod runs from the date of transfer of title.  Given the different approaches to \nfacilitating homeownership, this 30 year period will terminate between 2025 and \n2037.  fu addition, the City will be responsible for 315± rental units until2012 to \n2037. This totals approximately 740 units. \nAdministration \nThe City through the Yonkers Affordable Housing Department has been carrying out its \nmonitoring responsibilities as there have been resales, requests .for subordination of City \nof Yonkers mortgages, and households who have opted out of the· rental program.  This \nmonitoring will continue.  The City's continuing activities will be as follows: \nHomeownershlp \nI!  . \n•  Identifying and qualifying subsequent purchasers \n•  Responding  to  requests  for:  subordination  of City of Yonkers  mortgages  for \nrefinancings, home equity loans, etc. \n•  Securing primary residency affidavits from owners annually \n•  Running credit reports of owners annually to  preserve program assets,  e.g.,  if \nthere  a:re  latenesses  in  mortgage  payment  and/or  excessive  debt  and/or \nmismanagement of debt, the City will contact the owner to  assist in resolving \nfinanciaR issues  · \n•  Handling notices of default or foreclosures from primary lenders or cooperatives \nthrough Coop Recognition Agreements \n•  Handle violations of Restrictive Covenants and City of Yonkers mortgages and \nnotes, e.g., failure to occupy the property as primary residence or failure to rent \nsecond unit to LTPO qualified renter \n•  Refer qualified purchasers to River Club and Ridge Hill developments assuming \ncompletion of projects and participate in closings to assure proper recordation of \nrestrictive covenants and City ofYonkersmortgages \n•  Manage Homeownership database and files \nRental Assistance Program \n•  Manage monthly disbursements of City ofYonkers payments to owners \n•  Annual certification ofhousehold incomes \n•  Handle lease renewals and renewals of the Rental Assistance Contract (between \nowner and the City of Yonkers), including rent increases, on an annual or a bi \nannual basis as appropriate \n•  Inspect  rental  units  upon  lease  renewal  to  assure  continued  compliance with \nproperty standards \n6 \n\nI \nI \n•  Respond to and mediate landlord/tenant issues to the extent possible \n•  Should landlord decide not to renew lease, assist tenant to locate alternative unit \n•  Should tenant decide to  relocate,  inspect new unit for locational and property \nstandard  compliance,  advise  new  landlords  about  the  program,  and  handle \npreparation and execution of leases and Rental Assistance Contracts \n•  Should tenants decide not to participate in the program or no longer qualify to \n·participate, qualify additional LTPO applicants  · \n•  Manage Rentaf Assistance Program database and files \nOther Rental Assistance Programs \n•  Secure affidavits from owners and tenants under the Purchase Assistance Program \nthat they are in compliance with LTPO requirements \n•  Refer qualified LTPO applicants to owners upon tenant turnover, interact with \nproperty management, and secure leases \n•  Evaluate annual reports and certifications on LTPO compliance from the owners \nof St.  James  Gardens,  Hudson View,  and  AHO  projects  and take  action .as \nrequired  .  , \n•  Refer qualified LTPO applicants to Ridge Hill development assuming completion, \ninteract with management and secure leases \n•  Maintain Other Rental Assistance Program database and files \nMaintenance of LTPO Database:  Following the Effective Date of the Agreement, the. \nCity will send a notice to each applicant who has not been assisted under the program to \ndetermine their interest in remaining on a waiting list.  To remain on the list, they will be·: \n-required to provide updated income data and rental history information within a certain \ntime frame.  A credit teport will also be run.  If they fail to meet the screening and \nselection criteria, they will be guided on what is needed to qualify, e.g., reduction of debt, \na minimurn of one year of satisfactory rent payments, etc.  Applications will continue to \nbe accepted.  Financial literacy and homebuying clubs will be offered twice a year to help \nexisting and new applicants achieve program standards.  The City will also  conduct \noutreach at least annually to solicit new applications. \nAs homeownership or rental units become available, the City will refer households from \nthis list using the LTPO priorities, i ..e ., households who have lived in assisted or public \nhousing in Yonkers at any time since 1971; followed by households who are residents of \nYonkers; followed by households who are employed in Yonkers.  The income criteria of \nthe LTPO will also be followed. \nThe City will use the services of the Housing Action Council to manage the program and \nmonitor on-going compliance with the LTPO for a minimum three year period.  At that \ntime, the City will opt to renew its contract _with HAC, use another service provider or \nhandle monitoring in-house.  Should the City decide on the latter, it will arrange for a \ntransition  so  that  City  staff are  properly  trained  in  monitoring  responsibilities  and \ndatabase's are transferred. \n7 \n\nATTACHMENTB \nCity of Yonkers Affordable Housing Ordinance \nBackground \nThe Affordable Housing Ordinance (\"AHO\" or \"Ordinance\") provides· for an overlay \ndistrict to theM, MG, B, A and BA Zones and such other zones in which multifamily \nhousing is or may be permitted in East and Northwest Yonkers, including those zones \nthat permit multifamily housing as a special use. It also permits developers 'to apply for \nzoning changes  to  build multifamily inclusionary zoning in any district in East  and \nNorthwest Yonkers not zoned M, MG, B, A and BA.  Under the AHO, the City may \nexempt any multifamily housing development\" of fewer than 10 units from inclusionary \nzoning.  Multifamily development is defined as \"one or more residential buildings, each \ncontaining three or more attached dwelling units\". \nUnder the AHO  as  enacted in  1988  and  currently in effect,  the affordable set-aside \nrequirement is 20% unless the proposed development is in an A or BA Zone and in other \nzones which permit a density of 60  units per acre or more, in which case it may be \ndropped to 10 %. \nThe  current  Ordinance  contains  the  following  income  and  bedroom  distribution  and \narchitectural integration  requirements. \nIncome Distribution Requirements \n•  30% of the units must be affordable to  families  earning less than 50% of the \nmedian income of Westchester County adjusted by family size \n•  45% of the units must be affordable to families earning between 51% and 80% of \nthe median income  · \n•  25% of the units must be affordable to families earning between 81% and 100% \nofthe median income \nBedroom Distribution Requirements \n•  At least 60% ofthe units must be two bedroom units \n•  At least 30% of the units must be three bedroom units \n•  No more than 10% ofthe units can be one bedroom units \nArchitectural Integration Requirements \n•  There can be no locational distinctions between assisted and other units provided \nthat for any building eight or more stories, the top two floors may be reserved for \nmarket rate housing. \nThe Ordinance as currently in effect provides for  incentives to  establish the financial \nfeasibility of inclusionary developments, including height, bulk and density bonuses, tax \nabatement, waiver of application and/or processing fees, use of Affordable Housing Trust \n\n1 \n.f \nfunds,  or fmancial assistance from the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency.  The \ntype, extent and combination of incentives are left to the discretion of the City taking into \naccount the degree to which assisted financing may be available and market conditions. \nThe current Ordinance also provides for an expedited site plan approval process. \nAs of the Effective Date of the Agreement, five  projects have been approved under the \nAHO- Hudson View Terrace in the Northwest quadrant with 10 units; the Milleniuin \nproject in the Northwest quadrant with 10 units;  River Club in the Northwest quadrant \nwith  35  ownership  units,  and  the  Midland  Avenue  deyelopment  in  the  Southeast \nquadrant with 2 rental units for a total of 47 units.  The Ridge Hill project has also \nreceived approval.  Hudson View Terrace is completed; the Millenium project is on hold; \nRiver Club with 35 affordable units  and Ridge Hill with  135  affordable units are in \ndevelopment. \nRecommendations \nThe Affordable Housing Ordinance can generate inclusionary housing across a range of \nincome groups. There are several features ofthe Ordinance that facilitate this: \n•  a requirement (as compared to  an incentive)  that  affordable housing units be \nincluded in multifamily developments \n•  income and bedroom distribution requirements \n•  oversight by an office specifically charged with facilitating affordable housing \nopportunities, including reviewing project concepts, negotiating affordable sale \nprices and rent levels, and qualifying prospective renters and owners \nIn addition, the availability of funds and financing for affordable housing, such as tax \nexempt financing through the NYS Housing Finance Agency and the Yonkers Industrial \nDevelopment Authority and downpayment  funds  from  the NYS  Affordable Housing \nCorp. help create affordable housing. \nTo continue to encourage the development of inclusionary housing after the Effective \nDate, the City may make the following changes to the AHO: \n1.  Incorporate  inclusionary  zoning  provisions  into  the  zoning  ordinance \nwithout reference to Long Term Plan Order.  (Section 43-192 has a sunset provision.) \n2.  Expand  the  mandate  to  all  multifamily  developments  regardless  of \nlocation. \n3.  Reduce the set-aside requirement to 15% but allow for up to 20% for all· \nmulti-family developments except those zoned for densities of 60+ per acre (1 0%). \n2 \n\n4.  Modify SeCtion 43-198 Affordability Criteria as follows: \na.  The Yonkers  Affordable Housing  Office or Housing Action Council may \nwork with the developer during the site plan approval ·process  to  set sale \nprices  and rentals.  The current provision uses the income of the actual \noccupant to set sale price and rent levels.  Instead, sale prices and rent levels \nmay be projected based on income categories to  be assisted. . These levels \nshould be below the maximum so that there is a market for the units, e.g., \nprice units at a level affordable to households with incomes at 40% (rather \nthan 50%) ofthe median. \nb.  Change  assumptions:  10%  downpayment  to  3%  downpayment;  use  a \nmaximum of 33% of income rather than 30% to determine affordability in \nownership developments; eliminate reference t~ \" ... or such higher percentage \nas permitted by the applicable housing finance program.\" \nc.  Use the resale and rental increase formulas currently followed by the Yonkers \nAffordable Housing Program.  (See memo  on Maintenance of Affordable \nUnits.)  · \nd.  Maintain preferences for prior residents of public· or subsidized housing in \nYonkers, City residents and employees.  Require one year of residency or \nemployment to qualify. \ne.  Maintain  the  pre-screening  procedure  by  an  agency  like  the  Yonkers ... \nAffordable Housing Office or Housing Action Council. \n5.  Modify Section 43~199 to  use the standards of NYS  Housing Finance \nAgency for  square  footage  in  80-20  projects  rather  than HLTD  minimum  property \nstandards. \n6.  Provide discretion to the Planning Board to modify bedroom distribution \nrequirements on a case by case basis. \n7.  Allow the appropriate City agencies to  waive bulk, height and density \nprovisions and/or to abatereal estate taxes or waive application and/or processing \nfees to establish financial feasibility of inclusionary developments. (The current AHO \nprovides  for  this.)  The  Yonkers  Affordable  Housing Office or Housing  Action \nCouncil may make recommendations to the appropriate City agencies for any such \nmodification. \n3 ",

Whether the district court erred in entering the Long\nTerm Plan Order and subsequent enforcement orders;\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding the City of\nYonkers in contempt for failing to comply with its orders;\n3. Whether the district court erred in holding four\nindividual council members in contempt;\n4. Whether the district court's contempt orders should be\nstayed pending the resolution of these appeals on the merits.\n\n-2-\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n4(cid:9)\nOn August 2, 1988, the district court adjudged the City Of\nYonkers (City) and three members of the Yonkers City Council\n(Fagan, Longo, and Chema) in civil contempt of court (8/2/88 Tr.\n21-24, 42, 62; 8/2/88 Order).V On August 4, a fourth member of\nthe City Council (Spallone) also was found in civil contempt\n(8/4/88 Order; 8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). These findings of contempt\nresulted from the City's and the Council members' refusal to\ncomply with remedial orders entered by the district court,\nincluding the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order (United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635 F. Supp. 1577 (S.D.N.Y. 1986),\naff'd, 837 F.2d 1181 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct.\n2821 (1988)); the January 28, 1988, Consent Decree, which was\napproved by the City Council and to which the City consented; the\nJune 13, 1988, Long Term Plan Order; and the July 26, 1988, Order\nissued by the district court seeking to enforce its previous\norders. In this Statement, we focus primarily upon the orders\nunder review and the proceedings which relate directly to those\norders. However, because the City's most recent refusals to\ncomply with the court's orders are a part of a pattern of\ncontemptuous conduct -- \"the latest of a series of contempts\"\nJ Because of the short briefing schedule, the record has not yet\nbeen filed in these appeals. However, this case has been before\nthis Court before and much of the record has been docketed in\nconnection with the pending consolidated appeal Nos. 87-6070 and\n88-6078. Where possible, we refer to documents in that record by\nrecord number (\"R.\"). Documents that are not already docketed in\nthis Court are identified by date and title. It is our\nunderstanding that counsel for the City will be providing copies\nof such documents to the Court after the briefs have been filed.\n\n- 3 -\ns\n(8/2/88 Tr. 23) -- we have set forth as Addendum A_to this brief\na record of the court's efforts to enforce its housing remedy\nto comply with those orders over\norders, and the City's failure \nthe last two years.\nA. The liability and remedy orders\nOn November 20, 1985, the district court found the City\nliable for intentional housing segregation, in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair\nHousing Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et sea. United\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 624 F. Supp. 1276, 1289-1376\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985).21 Following remedial proceedings, the district\ncourt entered its Housing Remedy Order on May 28, 1986. Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. 1577. This Court affirmed the district court's\nliability and remedy orders \"in all respects\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184.\nIn its liability opinion, the district court found that the\nCity had deliberately concentrated virtually all of its public\nand other subsidized housing in the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers, and had done so to maintain residential segregation in\nthe city. Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1289-1376. One of the bases\n21 \nThe district court also found the City and the Yonkers Board\nof Education liable for intentionally segregating the Yonkers\npublic schools, Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1537, 1545, and ordered\nthe City to fund a system-wide desegregation plan to be\nimplemented by the Board. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1583. This\nCourt upheld the school liability findings and remedy orders.\nYonkers,.837 F.2d at 1184. The City's appeals of the district\ncourt's denial of its motion to modify the school remedy to\ndelete the requirement that it fund the construction of two new\nschools are now pending before this Court (Nos. 87-6070, 88-6078).\n\n-4-\nfor the district court's liability findings was the City's\ndeference to the extreme, race-based public opposition that\ndeveloped whenever subsidized housing was proposed outside of\nsouthwest Yonkers. Id. at 1294-1300, 1306-1307, 1314-1316,\n1362-1363, 1369. This Court specifically affirmed this basis\nfor liability. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1221-1226.\nPart VI of the district court's May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy\nOrder required the City to develop and implement a Plan for the\ncreation of subsidized housing outside the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers (the Long Term Plan).(cid:9) Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1582.\nThe district court expressly declined to set a goal for the\nnumber of assisted housing units to be provided, to establish a\ntimetable for the development of such housing, or to prescribe\nthe mechanisms by which such housing should be provided. Ibid.;\nR. 149, p. 6. Rather, it left to the City both the opportunity\nand the responsibility for proposing the substance of the Long\nTerm Plan. The Order required the City to submit its proposed\nPlan no later than November 15, 1986. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at\n1582.\nPart IV of the Housing Remedy Order required the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of public housing in east Yonkers.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The public housing aspect of\nthe remedy is not directly at issue in this appeal, although the\nCity's noncompliance with that portion of the Housing Remedy\nOrder forms part of the background to the district court's\nfindings of contempt here (see Addendum A). Related appeals\nwhich grew out of the public housing aspect of the remedy orders\nin this case are pending before this Court (Yonkers Racing Coro.\nv. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6140; St. Joseph's Seminary and\nCollege v. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6146).\n\n-5-\nThe City refused to submit such a proposal, and stated to\nthe court by letter dated November 14, 1986, that \"it is not\nanticipated that a plan will  be submitted to the Court in\naccordance with Part VI of the Order\" (11/14/86 Letter, Sculnick\nat 4-5). \nto Judge Sand; 7/1/87 Order  On December 5, 1986, the\nUnited States moved to have the City held in contempt, and on\nDecember 9, the NAACP moved for the appointment of a special\nmaster to carry out the City's responsibilities. Rather than\nimposing such sanctions, in early 1987, the district court\npermitted the City to appoint an Outside Housing Advisor (OHA) to\nprepare its Long Term Plan proposal (7/1/87 Order; R. 233).A/\nB. The Consent Decree\nIn January 1988, following this Court's affirmance of the\ndistrict court's liability and remedial decisions, the parties\nentered into negotiations designed to resolve outstanding issues\nrelating to compliance with the original housing remedy order,\nA/ Over the next months, much of the time and energies of the OHA\nand the parties were devoted to the public housing aspects of the\nHousing Remedy Order (see Addendum A, 117-19). On July 1, 1987,\nthe district court found that the City \"has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy Order. Instead the\nCity has delayed meaningful remedial action and declined repeated\nopportunities accorded to the City to act itself in the first\ninstance in taking remedial action\" (7/1/87 Order  at 1-2). The\ncourt ordered the City to take a number of actions relating to\nboth the Long Term Plan and the public housing aspects of the\nremedy order (id. at 2-6), and ruled that its failure to comply\nwould result in a finding of contempt and the imposition of fines\nof $100 per day, doubled every day until the City complied (}\nat 6-7). The City complied with the letter of the July 1 Order\nbut not with its spirit (see Addendum A, 11 13-17). In\nSeptember, the OHA submitted his suggestions for a Long Term\nPlan, and the parties filed comments on the OHA's submissions in\nJanuary 1988.\n\n-6-\nincluding the Long Term Plan. After weeks of negotiations, the\nin\nparties reached agreement on the First Remedial Consent Decree \nEquity (Consent Decree), which was approved by the City Council\non January 27, and entered by the district court on January 28,\n1988 (1/28/88 Consent Decree).\nSections 12 through 18 of the Consent Decree, entitled\n\"Assisted Housing,\" set forth the basic outlines of the Long Term\nPlan (id. at 7-11). The Decree set a long term goal of 800\nunits of assisted housing to be developed over 4 years  (id. at\n7), \"in conjunction with or as part of\" developments of market\nrate housing (id. at 8). In Section 17 of the Consent Decree,\nthe City agreed to adopt \"Mandated Incentives,\" including\nlegislation establishing various incentives designed to encourage\nthe development of such housing by private developers  (id. at 9-\n10).J The Decree required the City to adopt such legislation\nJ Section 17 of the Consent Decree provides, in pertinent part\n(id. at 9-10):\nThe City agrees to adopt, among other\nthings, legislation (a) conditioning the\nconstruction of all multi-family housing\n* * * on the inclusion of at least 20\npercent assisted units; (b) granting\nnecessary tax abatements to housing\ndevelopments constructed under the terms of\nthe legislation referred to in clause (a);\n(c) granting density bonuses to such\ndevelopers; (d) providing for zoning changes\nto allow the placement of such developments,\nprovided, however, that such changes are not\nsubstantially inconsistent with the character\nof the area; and (e) other provisions upon\nwhich the parties may subsequently agree\n* * *,\n\n-7-\n\"as promptly as practicable but, in no event, later than 9Q days\nafter\" January 28, 1988, i.e., by April 27, 1988 (ibid.).\nSection 18 of the Decree required the parties to negotiate a\nsecond consent decree by February 15, 1988, with regard to the\nunresolved details of the Long Term Plan (ibid.).\nOn March 21, citing intense public opposition to the remedy,\nthe City moved to modify the Consent Decree (3/21/88 Deft.\nMotion to Amend). In connection with that motion, the City\nstated its willingness to refund more than $29 million in\nfederal funds that it had received since 1980, if it were\nrelieved of its obligation to provide sites for public housing in\neast Yonkers, as required by the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (see Addendum A, q 23). The court denied the\nmotion (3/31/88 Tr. 64).\nC. The Long Term Plan Order\nPursuant to the Consent Decree, the parties began\nnegotiations on the details of the Long Term Plan in February.\nDrafts of the Plan were prepared by counsel for the City.\nHowever, the City broke off negotiations in April after the\nplaintiffs would not agree to amend the Consent Decree and the\ncourt denied the City's motion for such amendment (see Addendum\nA, 11 23, 24). On May 2, 1988, the United States and the NAACP\nsubmitted to the court a proposed Long Term Plan Order, which was\nbased upon the draft that had been prepared by the City's\nlawyers, and which largely reflected the parties' agreements\nreached during negotiations (5/2/88 Joint Motion at 4-8).\n\n- 8 -\nConsistent with the outline of the Plan set forth in the  Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7-11), the plaintiffs' proposed\norder contemplated a program of incentives and City actions\ndesigned to induce private developers to develop affordable\nhousing, in combination with market rate housing, in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (5/2/88 Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenors'\nProposed Long Term Plan Order). The proposed order granted the\nCity discretion to establish the mix of Mandated Incentives which\nit would make available to each developer, and set forth examples\nof the types of Mandated Incentives which the City would\nimplement (id. at 10-12). The United States and the NAACP also\nsubmitted joint amended comments setting forth the rationale for\neach aspect of their proposed order (5/2/88 Plaintiff and\nPlaintiff-Intervenors' Joint Amended Long Term Plan Comments).\nThe City opposed the plaintiffs' proposed order. In\naddition to opposing entry of any Long Term Plan Order on the\nground that it had moved to vacate the Consent Decree (see\nAddendum A, ¶% 25-26), the City stated three specific objections\nto the plaintiffs' proposed order:\n(a) its requirement that all multi-family\nhousing be built in at least an 080/20\"\nconfiguration is excessively restrictive, and\nthe city proposes that the order contain a\nvariance procedure for permitting less than\n20% assisted units (though not less than 10%)\nin any development;\n(b) its failure to provide for any\nefficiency or one bedroom units in the\naffordable price categories is contrary to\nthe evidence that a need for such units\nexists; and\n\n-9-\n(C) no new Office of Implementation is\nappropriate or necessary, since existing City\nshould be given the\nagencies and resources \nresponsibility of implementing the plan.\n(5/16/88 City's Memorandum In Opposition to Plaintiffs' Joint\nProposed Long-Term Plan at 3). In addition, the\nMotion to Enter \nCity suggested specific changes in the provisions regarding\nresale restrictions, architectural integration, mandated\nincentives, and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (id. at 4).\nThe City stated that the \"overall thrust\" of its proposed\nchanges was \"to give greater flexibility to the City to respond\naffirmatively to development proposals which do not meet all of\nthe specific restrictions\" in the plaintiffs' proposed order\n(id. at 19). In opposing the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office, the City emphasized its preference for\nretaining responsibility for implementation of the Plan in\nexisting City agencies (id. at 13-16).\nThe district court then requested the plaintiffs to submit a\nrevised proposed order reflecting, to the extent agreeable to the\nplaintiffs, the City's comments on the plaintiffs' initial\nproposal. Plaintiffs submitted such a revised proposal on June\n2, 1988. Following argument on June 8 (6/8/88 Tr. 146-183), the\nLong Term Plan Order was entered, as further modified by the\ncourt, on June 13, 1988 (6/13/88 Long Term Plan Order).\nThe court's order included a number of modifications to the\nplaintiffs' proposed order, in response to the City's objections\nrelating to the minimum percentage of subsidized units in a\ndevelopment (id. at 2), provision for some one-bedroom units (id.\n\n- 10 -\nat 3), architectural integration (id. at 9-10), and permissible\nuses of funds from the Affordable Housing Trust  Fund (i_ at 13-\n14). The court's order also included a provision giving priority\nto developer proposals that would \"assure the provision of\nassisted housing in a dispersed manner and so to  avoid the undue\nconcentration of both public and assisted units in any\nneighborhood of Yonkers\" (id. at 4). The City's objections to\nthe order that were not accepted by the court involved the\ncreation of an Implementation Office to implement the Plan\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178-180), the use of tax abatements (id. at 177-178),\nand the reduction of the transfer restriction for housing\ndeveloped under the Plan from 30 to 20 years (id. at 178).\nThe City has appealed the entry of the June 13 Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nD. Enforcement of the Consent Decree\nand Long Term Plan Order\nAs of June 13, more than four months after entry of the\nConsent Decree, and more than one month after the deadline to\nwhich it had agreed, the City had failed to pass the legislation\nrequired by Section 17 of the Decree. On June 17, with the Long\nTerm Plan Order entered, and thus the specific content of the\nnecessary legislation established, the United States asked the\nCourt to set a timetable for the legislation's enactment (6/21/88\nJ The 30-year restriction originated in the drafts prepared by\nthe City during negotiations, and was reflected in similar plans\nof a number of New Jersey towns which had been submitted by the\nCity during negotiations (6/8/88 Tr. 155). The City\nacknowledged at argument that the dispute on this issue was \"hard\nto resolve on the merits\" (id. at 178).\n\n- 11 -\nCourt Exh. A). In a telephone conference, counsel for the City\nstated that a consulting firm had been retained to draft  the\nfor\nappropriate legislation, that a draft would be available \nreview by the plaintiffs and the OHA by July 19, and that City\nCouncil action could be anticipated at the next City Council\nmeeting -- perhaps in August (6/21/88 Tr. 3). The district\ncourt expressed its concern about continued delay and requested\nthe City Council to pass a resolution adopting the provisions of\nthe Consent Decree and the Long Term Plan Order (id. at 3-4,\n21\n20).  Counsel for the City drafted such a resolution\n\"indicating [the City Council's] commitment to the\nimplementation of\" the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree,\nand the Long Term Plan Order (Res. No. 177-1988). On June 28,\n1988, the Yonkers City Council voted, 5 to 1, to reject the\nresolution (ibid.).\nFollowing this action, the district court directed the\nplaintiffs to prepare a proposed order \"requiring Yonkers to take\nspecific implementing action pursuant to a prescribed time-table,\non penalty of a finding of contempt and the imposition of\nbankrupting fines\" (6/29/88 Order).0 On July 5, 1988,\nplaintiffs submitted such a proposed order, setting forth a\nL The court indicated that it was particularly concerned in\nlight of a resolution passed by the City Council the previous\nweek declaring a moratorium on the development of all public\nhousing in the City of Yonkers, despite the provisions of the\nHousing Remedy Order and the Consent Decree requiring the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of such housing (6/21/88 Tr. 4, 18;\nsee Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\nJ' The City has appealed the entry of the June 29 Order.\n\n- 12 -\ntimetable for City actions and providing that failure  to take\nsuch actions would Subject the City to possible contempt\nSanctions (7/5/88 Plaintiffs' Notice of Motion and Proposed\nOrder) .\nIn its memorandum opposing entry of the proposed order, the\nCity stated that \"the City has indicated by the defeat of the\n[June 28] Resolution * * * that it will not voluntarily adopt the\nlegislation contemplated by [the Long Term Plan] Order\" (7/12/88\nCourt Exh. A at 4). The City argued that, rather than imposing\ncontempt sanctions on the City for its refusal to comply with the\ncourt's orders, the court should simply \"enter an order adopting\nthe necessary\" legislation (id. at 3).\nAt the hearing on July 12, the district court solicited the\nparties' comments on the possible creation by the court of an\nAffordable Housing Commission, which would exercise all of the\nCity Council's functions relating to the implementation of the\nhousing remedy orders (7/12/88 Tr. 6-9). In written comments,\nthe United States opposed the creation of such a commission\nbecause it would allow the City and its officials to avoid their\nobligation to comply with the lawful housing remedy orders of the\ndistrict court and allow them to continue to inflame community\nopposition to the court's orders (7/22/88 Comments of the United\nStates). The City stated that it could not support the creation\nof a commission because it was concerned about divesting its City\nCouncil of its \"core legislative as well as executive functions\"\n\n- 13 -\n(7/25/88 city's Comments at 2). The NAACP supported the concept\nof a commission (7/22/88 Brief of NAACP).\nQn July 26, at the United States' urging, the district court\nentered an Order requiring the City, on or before August 1, to\nenact the legislation implementing the Long Term Plan, as\nrequired by Section 17 of the Consent Decree and in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88 Order).\nconsultants\nSuch legislation had been drafted by the City's own \nand incorporated the terms of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 2-6; 7/26/88 Court Exh. A). The City stated that it had no\nobjections to the proposed legislation except for those it had\npreviously expressed regarding the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 6; see pp. 8-10, supra). The July 26 Order provided that the\nCity's failure to enact the legislation, and to demonstrate why\nit should not be held in contempt at a show cause hearing on\nAugust 2, would subject the City to contempt and daily fines\nuntil it enacted the legislation.V The fines to be imposed were\nset at $100 for the first day of noncompliance with the daily\nrate doubling for each consecutive day of noncompliance (7/26/88\n21 \nThe City subsequently advised the district court of state\nprocedural requirements of notice and public hearing prior to the\nenactment of zoning ordinances which purportedly would have made\nit impossible for the City to adopt the ordinance at issue by\nAugust 1. By letter dated July 28, the Court clarified its order\nand advised the parties that its July 26 order would be satisfied\nif the City Council adopted a resolution on or before August 1\ncommitting itself to enact the ordinance within the minimum time\nprescribed for notice pursuant to state law (7/28/88 Letter from\nJudge Sand to All Counsel). The City has filed a notice of\nappeal from the July 28 letter. At its August 1 meeting the\nCity Council scheduled the required hearing on the legislation\nfor August 15 (8/2/88 Tr. 2).\n\n- 14 -\na(cid:9) Order at 2-3). In addition, if the legislation were not passed,\nfailed to vote for it, and failed\nmembers of the City Council who \nto demonstrate why they should not be held in contempt at the\nAugust 2 show cause hearing, would be held in contempt, fined\n$500 per day of noncompliance, and imprisoned after ten days of\nnoncompliance (id. at 3_4).1QJ The City has appealed the July\n26 Order.\nOn August 1, by a vote of 4 to 3, the City Council defeated\nthe resolution called for by the July 26 Order, as clarified by\nthe July 28 letter (8/2/88 Tr. 2). On August 2, the Court held\nthe City in contempt and imposed fines on the schedule set out in\nthe July 26 order. The City's lawyer reiterated its argument\nthat the court should order the legislation into effect, rather\nthan holding the City in contempt for refusing to enact it  (id.\nat 3). The court found that the City had been given adequate\nnotice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard (id. at\n23). In holding the City in contempt, the court found that the\n\"extent of the resistance by the City * * * is unprecedented\"\n(id. at 22), and that \"this is but the latest of a series of\ncontempts\" (id. at 23). The City has appealed from this contempt\norder.\nThe court also heard, on August 2, from three of the four\nCouncil members who had voted against the legislation.\nCouncilmen Fagan and Longo stated that they had voted against the\nThe individual sanctions would terminate if the legislation\n.1-QJ \nwere passed or if the individuals voted for the legislation\n(7/26/88 Order at 3-4).\n\n- 15 -\nlegislation because there had been no public hearing or\nopportunity for input from the public (id. at 40-42).\nCouncilman Chema gave no explanation for his vote. His attorney\ncontended that he had not had adequate opportunity to  prepare,\nbut did not subsequently take advantage of the court's offer to\nhold an evidentiary hearing the following week (id. at 44-54, 58-\n61). The court found that all three had had adequate notice and\nfound them in contempt (id. at 42, 62). The court gave each of\nthe individuals until August 5 to request an evidentiary hearing,\nset August 8 as the date for such a hearing if requested, and\nruled that the individuals' checks would not be cashed pending\nthe outcome of such a hearing (id. at 56-60). None of the\nindividuals requested an evidentiary hearing. Fagan, Longo, and\nChema have appealed the contempt orders.\nThe proceedings with respect to Councilman Spallone were\nadjourned until August 4 to enable him to retain counsel.(cid:9) On\nthat date, the court found that Spallone had had adequate notice\nof the court's order and of the consequences of his violation of\nthat order,i J and that he had deliberately violated the order\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35). Spallone's defense was that the court lacked\nthe power to order him to vote in a particular way and that he\nwas not bound to comply with the Consent Decree because he had\n11 Spallone, like the other Council members, was given the\noption of requesting an evidentiary hearing to be held on August\n8 (8/2/88 Tr. 63).\n.221 Spallone had been in court on July 26 when the order was\nentered (8/4/88 Tr. 4).\n\n- 16 -\nnot voted for it in January (id. at 7-8, 10-13, 28-29, 31). The\ncourt heard uncontradicted evidence that Spallone had made a\nnumber of statements indicating that he would not comply with the\ncourt's orders (id. at 24-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A). The court\nfound that no factual issues were in dispute and held him in\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). \ncontempt  Spallone has appealed the contempt\norder.\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt orders until argument of these appeals on the merits on\nAugust 17.\nARGUMENT\nThis Court affirmed the district court's May 28, 1986,\nHousing Remedy Order as \"plainly reasonable,\" \"necessary,\" and\n\"appropriate and prudent,\" particularly in light of \"[t]he City's\npast history of foot-dragging (e. g., nine years taken to approve\nsites for 750 units) and its refusals to approve any site for\nlow-income housing outside\" minority areas. United States v.\nYonkers Board of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1236-1237 (1987). Now,\nafter two more years in which the City has continued to delay\ncompliance and actively to defy the district court's remedy\norders -- and during which the court has given the City every\nopportunity to comply voluntarily -- the court has found the City\nin contempt and has imposed escalating fines designed to coerce\nthe City's compliance. As the district court stated (8/2/88 Tr.\n22-23):\nIt would be difficult to imagine a clearer\nchallenge to the constitution of the United\n\n- 17 -\nStates and to a government of law than that\ncourt\npresented this morning. If a federal \nto remedy racial\norder designed \ndiscrimination can be flouted by a\nbecause that is what appears to\nmunicipality \nbe the course of political expediency, then\na  form\nwe no longer live under  constitutional \nof government. Then one has to put an\nasterisk to the constitution and say,\n\"Provided, however, that if the community is\nsufficiently hostile to remedial action\ndesigned to insure and protect these rights,\nthen all bets are off.\"\nAs set forth below, the district court acted properly in\nentering the Long Term Plan Order; in imposing the contempt\nsanctions designed to coerce compliance with its orders; and in\nfinding the City and four members of the City Council in civil\ncontempt. The district court's orders should be affirmed and no\nfurther stay of the district court's contempt orders should be\ngranted.\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ENTERING THE LONG TERM PLAN ORDER\nA district court has \"substantial latitude\" in devising\nremedies for constitutional violations. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1236. On appeal, the reviewing court must \"acknowledge the\nrespect owed a District Judge's judgment that specified relief is\nessential to cure a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\"\nUnited States v. Paradise, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1073 (1987); and the\nchoice of remedies is entrusted \"'to the sound discretion of the\ntrial court.'\" Ibid., quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S.\n448, 508 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring), quoting Franks v.\n\n- 18 -\nBowman Trans. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 794 (1976) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). The district court\nhere did not abuse its discretion in entering the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nThe City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan  for the\ndevelopment of affordable housing outside the southwest quadrant\nof Yonkers was part of the original Housing Remedy Order and, as\nsuch, has already been upheld by this Court.  Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184. The Consent Decree, to which the City agreed and is\nindisputably bound, established the framework for and resolved\nthe most controversial issues relating to the Long Term Plan.\nThe Consent Decree set a goal of 800 units of privately developed\nassisted housing, to be developed in conjunction with market rate\nhousing over a four-year period, and committed the City to enact\nlegislation to effectuate the Plan (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7).\nThus, the City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan, and to\nenact legislation, in accordance with the Housing Remedy Order\nand the Consent Decree, is the law of the case and is not open to\nfurther review. See Crane Co. v. American Standard, Inc., 603\nF.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir. 1979).\nThe Consent Decree left the details of the Long Term Plan to\nfurther negotiations. However, after agreement had been reached\non a basic draft, the City broke off negotiations for reasons\nunrelated to the Long Term Plan itself (see p. 7, supra). Thus,\nin order to effectuate the Consent Decree, the plaintiffs were\nforced to submit a proposed Long Term Plan Order to the court for\n\n- 19 -\nentry. The court obtained the City's comments on the proposed\norder and heard argument on the disputed issues. on June 13 it\nentered an Order that was fully consistent with both the Housing\nRemedy Order and the Consent Decree, that largely reflected\nagreements which had been reached among the parties during\ntook \nnegotiations, and that  into account most of the objections\nexpressed by the City (see pp. 7-10, supra).\nMoreover, the City's remaining objections to the Order were\nrelatively minor and somewhat ambiguous. 13 The City contended\nthat resale restrictions on housing developed under the Plan\nshould be limited to 20 years, rather than 30. However, the 30-\nyear restriction had initially been proposed by the City and was\nfound in many of the municipal plans used as models for the Long\nTerm Plan during negotiations. The City's lawyer acknowledged at\nargument that this dispute was \"hard to resolve on the merits\"\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178). The City also objected to the Order's\nprovisions regarding the use of tax abatements, claiming that\nthey were inconsistent with state law. However, the City had\nspecifically agreed to grant tax abatements in the Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 9), and the City's lawyer\nstated at argument that the question of state law \"would require\nadditional study\" and contended only that granting tax\n1J \nThe City also contended that the Long Term Plan Order should\nnot be entered because it was based on the Consent Decree, which\nthe City had moved to vacate (see p. 8, supra). The court's\ndenial of the City's motion to vacate, which has not been\nappealed, vitiates that basis for objection to the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\n\n- 20 -\nabatements in the manner contemplated by the Order would be\n\"unfair\" to other residents of Yonkers (id. at 177-178).\nFinally, the City objected to the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office to administer the Plan, and argued that\nsuch responsibility should be vested in existing City agencies\n(id. at 178-180). However, the court found that, in light of\nthe City's history of obstructing the development of assisted\nhousing, a separate Implementation Office was appropriate to\nshield the implementation of the Plan from political interference\n(id. at 179).14\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\noverruling the City's objections to the proposed Order and in\nentering the June 13 Long Term Plan Order.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ISSUING ITS JUNE 29 AND JULY 26 ORDERS\nOn June 28, 1988, in response to a direct request from the\ncourt, the City Council refused to commit itself to complying\nwith the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long\n141 Neither the City nor any of the individual Council members\ncontent \ncited these objections to the  of the Long Term Plan Order\nas a reason for their refusal to enact the resolution on August\n1. See pp. 14-16, supra.\n\n- 21 -\nTerm Plan Order. 15 The City was already two months past the\ndate on which the Consent Decree required it to enact the\nimplementing legislation for the Long Term Plan. The Housing\nRemedy Order was more than two years old and, due to the City's\nobstruction and delay, no housing construction had begun.\nAgainst this background, the court issued its  June 29 Order\ndirecting the plaintiffs to submit a proposed order setting forth\na timetable for City compliance, and contempt sanctions in case\nof noncompliance. After submission of the proposed order, and\ncomments from the City, the court entered its July 26 Order.l6\nThat order required the City to enact the legislation necessary\nto implement the Long Term Plan Order, and declared that if the\nlegislation was not passed by August 1, the City and the members\nof the City Council who failed to vote for it would be required\nto show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt. A\nfinding of contempt would result in escalating fines for the\nCity, beginning at $100 per day and doubling every day, and fines\nof $500 per day for the individual Council members, who would\nalso be subject to imprisonment after 10 days of noncompliance.\n15 On the same date, the City Council adopted a resolution\ncalling for the withdrawal of the City's condemnation action for\none of the public housing sites designated by the Consent Decree\n(Addendum A, 1 28; Addendum C). One week earlier, the City\nCouncil had adopted a resolution declaring a moratorium on the\nconstruction of all public housing in the city, in defiance of\nthe public housing aspects of the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\n16 The court also considered, as an alternative or supplement to\ncontempt sanctions, the creation of a commission which would take\nover all of the executive and legislative functions of the City\nCouncil relating to the housing remedy (see pp. 12-13, supra).\n\n- 22 -\nA district court is vested with \"wide discretion\" in\nfashioning remedies to coerce compliance with its orders.\nVuitton et Fils S.A. v. Carousel Handba gs, 592 F.2d 126, 130 (2d\nCir. 1979). The district court did not abuse that discretion in\nissuing the June 29 and July 26 orders here.\ndid not err in selecting\nA. The district court \ncivil contempt as the appropriate sanction\nfor the City's noncompliance\nThe court's orders contemplated the imposition of civil\ncontempt sanctions, designed to coerce compliance with its\norders.

Local 28. Sheet Metal Workers v.\nEEOC, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 3033 (1986); McComb v. Jacksonville Paper\nCo., 336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949); Northside Realty Assocs. v. United\nStates, 605 F.2d 1348, 1356 (5th Cir. 1979) (contempt of\ninjunction under the Fair Housing Act). A party subject to such\ncoercive sanctions holds within its hands the power to end the\nsanctions by simply ceasing its contumacious conduct.  See\nShillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 368 (1966); United\nStates v. Handler, 476 F.2d 709, 714 (2d Cir. 1973). Here the\n\n- 23 -\nfines will end as soon as the City enacts the ordinance (or a\nresolution committing itself to enact the ordinance at the\nearliest possible time) as required by the district court's\norders. The dilemma of potentially bankrupting fines facing the\nCity is thus one of its own making and one which it has full\npower to avoid.\nThe City argued below that the court should have chosen a\ndifferent remedy for its noncompliance, and should have simply\nordered the legislation into effect)r2J But a court has no\nobligation to revise its prior orders -- particularly in a manner\ninconsistent with a consent decree the parties bargained for and\nobtained -- merely because a party decides not to comply.JJ\nMoreover, the City's alternative would not have addressed the\nunderlying problem here: the City's repeated refusal to obey the\ncourt's orders. It is the City, not the court, which has chosen\nthis confrontation. It is the City which has flouted the law.\nill This argument was inconsistent with the position adopted by\nthe City regarding the Long Term Plan Order. In urging the court\nnot to require it to create a separate Implementation Office, the\nCity argued that maximum responsibility should be retained by\nthe City's existing agencies (see pp. 8-9, su pra). In addition,\nthe City opposed the creation of a commission to carry out the\nCity Council's responsibilities because it would divest it of\n\"core legislative as well as executive functions\" (7/25/88 City's\nComments at 2).\nIn any case, direct judicial exercise of the legislative\nfunction would be more, not less intrusive than directing City\nofficials to exercise their responsibilities in accordance with\nthe court's remedy orders. The path now recommended by the City\ncould only ultimately lead to continuous judicial management of\nthe City's affairs. Contempt is the classic means of achieving\ncompliance with court orders and is better tailored to that end\nthan the City's suggested remedy.\n\n- 24 -\nIt is the City that must now comply with the law. As the\ndistrict court stated (8/2/88 Tr. 8-9):\n[T]here does have to come a moment of truth,\na moment of reckoning, a moment when the City\nof Yonkers seeks not to become a national\nsymbol of defiance to civil rights and to\nheap shame upon shame upon itself, but to\nrecognize its obligation to conform to the\nlaws of the land and not step by step, order\nby order, but in the way in which any\nresponsible community concerned about the\nwelfare of its citizens functions. That is\nnot going to be accomplished by this court\nadopting the ordinance.\nUnder the district court's orders, implementation of the\nLong Term Plan Order and the necessary legislation still rests\nsubstantially with City officials, including the City Council,\nwhere it belongs. The City, at long last, must be required to\nmeet its legal obligations under the court's remedial orders.\nThe court did not abuse its discretion in determining to impose\ncivil contempt sanctions to compel such compliance.\nB. The level of fines imposed upon the City were\nan appropriate means of coercing compliance\nThe district court has struggled with the City's\nextraordinary willingness to delay and obstruct the\nimplementation of the remedy and to defy the court's orders for\nmore than two years. The district court was thus in the best\nposition to determine the most effective means of securing the\nCity's compliance. The court's judgment regarding  the size of\nfines against the City and the nature and extent of the sanctions\nagainst contemptuous City officials is entitled to considerable\ndeference from this Court. Vuitton, supra.\n\n- 25 -\nCertainly the fines set by the July 26 Order will mount to\nbankrupting levels in a short time if the City continues to defy\nthe court's orders. Yet to be effective in  coercing this City's\ncompliance, any fines must be quite severe. The City is already\non record as being willing to refund over $29 million dollars to\ncompliance with the public\nthe federal government to avoid \nhousing aspect of the remedy, and to sell bonds in order to raise\nthat sum (see p. 7, supra, and Addendum A, 1 23). Thus the City\nis willing to pay an extremely high price to avoid the\ndevelopment of assisted housing in east Yonkers. Fines which\ngrew-more slowly would only succeed in compelling compliance more\nslowly, but would surely have to reach the same high levels\nbefore the City would finally comply.\nHere, the fines start at a very low level, thus allowing the\nCity Council some days to reflect and to change its course, or\nfor other authorities to intervene, 19 before a bankruptcy\noccurs. A different fine schedule -- for example, $100,000 per\nday -- might well be insufficient to compel compliance if the\nCity Council elected to try to sell bonds, levy  taxes or\notherwise raise the money to pay for its continued defiance. The\ndistrict court's schedule of fines does not allow the City time\nfor such tactics. That the fines here will rise at an\nescalating rate means only that the time for such reflection will\nend sooner rather than later, and that the City will finally\nThe City is subject to supervision by an Emergency Financial\nControl Board, which has broad powers over its finances. See\n7/22/88 Comments of the United States at 7-12.\n\n- 26 -\ncomply with the court's orders sooner rather than later. While a\ndifferent level of fines might, at first blush, appear less\nharmful to the citizens of Yonkers, the district court's order\nbetter serves the interests of justice and of  Yonkers residents\nbecause it ensures a rapid resolution to this controversy.\nThe Supreme Court approved the use of much harsher civil\ncontempt fines in United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S.\n258, 304-305 (1947), when it upheld a coercive fine of $2.8\nmillion dollars -- in 1947 dollars -- imposed on a union. More\nrecently, the Court has held that contemptuous conduct, including\na history of \"persistent or egregious discrimination\" and\n\"'foot-dragging resistance' to court orders\" may authorize the\ngranting of extraordinary relief where other methods fail, even\nwhere innocent third-parties may suffer. Local 28, 106 S. Ct. at\n3050, 3051. Indeed, here no party need suffer at all if the City\nsimply complies with the court's orders.\nZQJ In its stay papers in this Court, the City argued that the\nfines here violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth\nAmendment (City's Reply Memorandum at 5). However, the Eighth\nAmendment applies only to criminal proceedings and thus is\nirrelevant to civil contempt sanctions. In graham v. Wright, 430\nU.S. 651, 664 (1977); see Uphaus V. Wyman, 360 U.S. 72 (1959);\nUnited States v. Dien, 598 F.2d 743, 745 (2d Cir. 1979) (Eighth\nAmendment inapplicable to coercive imprisonment imposed as civil\ncontempt sanction).\n\n- 27 -\nThe court did not err in setting the schedule of fines for\nthe City at $100 per day, doubling every day.J\nC.

The district court's orders \nunduly intrude on local prerogative\nin the Consent\nThe City, through its City Council, agreed \nDecree to enact the legislation necessary to effectuate the Long\nTerm Plan. The City also agreed in the Consent Decree to\nnegotiate the details of the Plan, which were then to be included\nin the implementing legislation. It refused to carry out either\nof these obligations. As set forth above (pp. 17-20, supra), the\ncourt did not err in entering the Long Term Plan Order, which\nsupplied the content of the legislation. In order to ensure that\nits remedy orders would be implemented -- and the City's housing\nviolations at long last remedied -- the court was also authorized\nto order the City to enact the legislation.\nAs this Court has held, a court's power to \"restructure the\noperation of state and local entities\" is \"flexible but not\nunlimited.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1235. Such relief must be\n\"tailor[ed] * * * to fit the nature and extent of the\nviolation.\" Ibid.

We note, however, that there is a\nquestion whether such a position has been preserved for this\nappeal.

In addition, the county provided tuition grants and tax\ncredits to students attending white-only private schools. Here,\nof course, it is not the City Council's power to tax that is at\nissue. Rather, it is its power to affect the siting of assisted\nhousing, which was one of the bases for the finding of liability,\nand therefore the proper subject of the remedial orders.\n\n- 29 -\nthe court properly\nCouncil refused to carry out this obligation, \nordered it to do so.2--/\n2. The doctrine of legislative immunity\nhere\nis inapplicable \nprotects legislators24\nThe doctrine of legislative immunity \nfrom suits brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for damages or injunctive\nrelief \"based on their activities within the traditional sphere\nof legislative activity.\" Star Distributors, Ltd. v. Marino, 613\nF.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1980). As this Court has recognized, however,\nthe doctrine of legislative immunity has no application in cases\nsuch as this one where the injunction is directed toward\npreventing \"defiance of federal court desegregation orders.\" •\nat 10. Citing Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 191 F. Supp.\n871 (E.D. La.) (3-judge court), aff'd, sub nom., Dennyv. Bush,\n367 U.S. 908 (1961) (per curiam), this Court distinguished such a\ncase from the traditional application of legislative immunity in\na private Section 1983 action:\nThat case [Bush] involved an entirely\ndifferent set of circumstances from that in\n23 The alternative belatedly proposed by the City -- direct\njudicial exercise of the Council's legislative authority to adopt\nthe plan -- would have been a far greater intrusion on\nlegislative prerogative. Indeed, when the court suggested an\nindependent Commission be created that could exercise the City's\n\"core legislative\" function, the City objected (see pp. 12-13,\nsupra). Under the circumstances, it is impossible to reconcile\nthe City's positions (1) that the July 26 order unduly interferes\nwith its legislative prerogative, but that (2) judicial\nassumption of its legislative function in this area is\npermissible (and even preferable).\nThus, whatever its applicability to the City Council and\nCouncil members here, legislative immunity provides no shield for\nthe City itself.\n\n- 30 -\nthe present case. The injunction was granted\nnot pursuant to a private § 1983 civil action\nbut on a motion by the United States to\nvindicate the authority of a federal court.\nIt attacked an \"obvious\" pattern of \"delay,\nevasion, obstruction, defiance and reprisal.\"\nstar Distributors, Ltd., 613 F.2d at 10. In Bush, the 3-judge\ncourt enjoined the State Legislature of Louisiana from taking any\naction to enforce certain statutes \"and from otherwise\ninterfering in any way with the operation of the public schools.\"\nBush, 191 F. Supp. at 879. As in Bush, the district court here\nwas faced with \"an 'obvious' pattern of 'delay, evasion,\nobstruction, defiance and reprisal\" on the part of the City of\nYonkers and its City Council. Its orders requiring the City to\ncomply with the Long Term Plan Order and the Consent Decree -- in\nwhich the City had agreed to enact the legislation at issue --\nwere entirely proper. Legislative immunity cannot shield\nlegislators from sanctions for their blatant disregard for lawful\ncourt orders.\nIII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE CITY IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the City had adequate notice of the\ncourt's July 26 order, as modified by its July 28 letter. Nor is\nthere any dispute that the City failed to comply with that order.\nIndeed there can be no dispute that the City has violated the\nHousing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long Term Plan\nOrder. The City seeks to avoid contempt by arguing for the first\ntime in this litigation that the City as a corporate entity\n\n- 31 -\nshould be distinguished from the City Council, and that the City\nC\nshould not be forced to pay for the irresponsibility of some of\nits Council members.\nSuch a dichotomy finds no support in the law or in common\nsense. The City Council acts for the City. Like all municipal\ncorporations, the City functions through its governing bodies,\nand the official actions of the governing body constitute actions\nof the City:\nIf the decision to adopt that particular\ncourse of action is properly made by that\ngovernment's authorized decisionmakers, it\nsurely represents an act of official\ngovernment \"policy\" as that term is commonly\nunderstood. More importantly, where action\nis directed by those who establish\ngovernmental policy, the municipality is\nequally responsible * * *.\nPembaur V. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481 (1986) (footnote\nomitted); see also City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 108 S. Ct.\n915 (1988). Indeed, the City's original liability in this case\nwas based in part upon the actions and inactions of the City\nCouncil and individual Council members. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1188-1194, 1221-1223.\nBy adopting the Consent Decree, the City Council bound the\nCity to obey its mandates. The City cannot now avoid those\nobligations by seeking to separate itself from the only entity\nempowered to enact the legislation necessary to comply with the\nDecree. There is no authority to support the notion that a\ngovernmental entity itself cannot be held accountable if its\nofficials fail to carry out lawful court orders.\n\n- 32 -\nNor did the City's objection to entry of the Long Term Plan\nOrder justify its refusal to comply. First, the obligation to\nenact the legislation was derived from the Consent Decree, to\nwhich the City was a party. Second, as we have demonstrated (pp.\n17-20, supra), the entry of the Long Term Plan Order was entirely\nproper. Third, none of the Council members who voted against the\nresolution even mentioned the City's previously stated objections\nto the content of the Long Term Plan Order as a basis for their\nvotes. Most importantly, disagreement with a court's order does\nnot justify its violation:\n[There is] impressive authority for the\nproposition that an order issued by a court\nwith jurisdiction over the subject matter and\nperson must be obeyed by the parties until it\nis reversed by orderly and proper\nproceedings * * *. \"'* * * It is for the\ncourt of first instance to determine the\nquestion of the validity of the law, and\nuntil its decision is reversed for error by\norderly review, either by itself or by a\nhigher court, its orders based on its\ndecision are to be respected, and\ndisobedience of them is contempt of its\nlawful authority, to be punished.\"\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 293 (citations omitted). Such\nis true even where, as is emphatically not the case here, the\ninjunction would \"raise substantial * * * issues concerning * * *\nits provisions.\" Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 316\n(1967). Nor can refusal to comply with a federal court order be\ndefended by claims of the \"political difficulties\" of\ncompliance. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d 33, 37 (2d Cir.\n1986), cert. denied, 107 S. Ct. 955 (1987).\nThus the City was properly found in contempt of court.\n\n- 33 -\nIV\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the individual Council members had\nnotice of the July 26 order (as modified by the  July 28 letter),\nthe\nthat they violated that order by failing to vote for \nresolution, or that they had adequate opportunity to  be heard\nprior to the court's contempt findings.(cid:9) Nor is there any\ndoubt that the Council members were bound by the court's orders.\nIn committing the City to the Consent Decree, the City Council\nbound itself to its terms.(cid:9) Pursuant to Rule 65(d) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, an injunction is binding upon\nthe parties to an action and their \"officers, agents, servants,\n[and] employees.\" As the Court stated in United States v. City\nof Providence, 492 F. Supp. 602, 610 (D.R.I. 1980):\n[A]lthough no City officers are specifically\nbefore the Court, the Decree is specifically\nbinding upon them, and * * * they also might\nbe brought before the Court and be required\nto adhere to the provisions of the Amended\nConsent Decree.\nSee pp. 14-16, supra. In addition, as the district court\nruled on August 2, the City Council members received adequate\nnotice of the possible need for counsel at the contempt hearing\n(8/2/88 Tr. 31-32, 44-52). Thus, any claim of inadequate time\nfor preparation by counsel for the hearing due to last minute\nretention by any Council member must be rejected. In any event,\nthe district court offered to hold an additional hearing if any\nCouncil member so requested (id. at 58-62).\n26 The fact that the January 28, 1988, judgment was entered by\nconsent does not lessen the respect due that judgment by the City\nand the City Council. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d at 38.\n\n- 34 -\n%\t See also Shakman v. Democratic Ora., 533 F.2d 344, 352 (7th Cir.)\ncert. denied, 429 U.S. 858 (1976).\nWhere civil contempt is concerned, the inquiry ends here.\nThe intent of the individual Council members or their motivation\nfor disobeying the district court's mandate are irrelevant to\nthat court's finding of civil contempt. The Supreme Court held\nin McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. at 191 (citations\nand footnote omitted):\nThe absence of wilfulness does not relieve\nfrom civil contempt. Civil as distinguished\nfrom criminal contempt is a sanction to\nenforce compliance with an order of the\ncourt * * *. Since the purpose is remedial,\nit matters not with what intent the defendant\ndid the prohibited act. The decree was not\nfashioned so as to grant or withhold its\nbenefits dependent on the state of mind of\nrespondents.\nSee SEC v. American Board of Trade. Inc., 830 F.2d 431, 441 (2d\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct. 1118 (1988); Donovan v.\nSovereign Security. Ltd., 726 F.2d 55, 59 (2d Cir. 1984). In any\ncase, it cannot be disputed that the City Council members here\ndid willfully violate the court's order (see 8/2/88 Tr. 41-42,\n62; 8/4/88 Tr. 23-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A).\nThe district court did not err in holding the City Council\nmembers in contempt.\nV\nNO ADDITIONAL STAY OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S\nCONTEMPT ORDERS SHOULD BE GRANTED\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt order 'only until the appeals are argued on Wednesday,\n\n- 35 -\nAugust 17, 1988\" (8/9/88 Order). When that stay was issued, this\nCourt had not had the opportunity to hear the merits of these\nappeals. Now, however, the merits have been fully briefed and,\nas we have demonstrated above, the district court's orders were\nentirely justified. Because there is no substantial possibility\nthat the appellants will succeed on the merits, no further stay\nshould be granted. 27 Indeed, we urge this Court to affirm the\ndistrict court's orders forthwith.\nNeither the City nor the Council members can show that they\nwill be irreparably harmed if no further stay is granted. Each\nhas the ability to purge the contempt, and avoid any harm, by the\nsimple act of complying with the district court's orders.\nIndeed, any further delay in the enforcement of the contempt\norders would irreparably harm the public interest and the\ninterests of the plaintiffs here because it would permit the City\nand the Council members to continue to violate the district\ncourt's orders with impunity. For more than two years the City\nhas defied the court's authority. This nearly total disrespect\nfor the judicial process continues today and will continue as\nThe standards for granting a stay pending appeal are well\nestablished. A movant must show that there is a substantial\npossibility that it will prevail on the merits of its appeal,\nthat it will be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted, and\nthat granting a stay will not irreparably harm the nonmoving\nparties or the public interest. Dubose v. Pierce, 761 F.2d 913,\n920 (2d Cir. 1985), vacated on other grounds, 108 S. Ct. 2890\n(1988), citing Coleman v. Paccar. Inc., 424 U.S. 1301, 1305\n(1976) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice), and O'Brien v. Brown, 409\nU.S. 1, 3 (1972) (per curiam).\n\n- 36 -\nlong as the contempt order is stayed. As the Supreme Court has\nstated:\n[R]espect for judicial process is a small\nprice to pay for the civilizing hand of law,\nwhich alone can give abiding meaning to\nconstitutional freedom.\nWalker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. at 321. A stay of the\ncontempt order would stay \"the civilizing hand of law\" and\nirreparably harm the public interest.\nA stay also would further delay the implementation of the\nremedy and the vindication of the constitutional rights of the\ncitizens of Yonkers to equal opportunity in housing, and would\nfurther delay the enforcement of the nation's civil rights laws\nin Yonkers. In Griffin, 377 U.S. at 234, the Supreme Court\ndeclared that \"(t]he time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run\nout.\" Here, the time for the City of Yonkers to comply with the\ncourt's orders has run out. If this Court does not affirm\nbefore the stay expires, certainly it should not extend the stay.\n\n- 37 -\nCONCLUSION\n11\nFor the reasons stated above, the  district court's orders\nshould be affirmed forthwith.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

Thorne\nAttorney\n\nADDENDUM A\n\nADDENDUM A\n1. Part IV.A. of the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order\nrequired the City to submit its Housing Assistance Plan  (HAP) to\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within 15\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635\ndays of the Order. United \nF. Supp. 1577, 1580 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). The submission of such a\nHAP was a prerequisite to the City's receipt of Community\nDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Ibid. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to submit a HAP, the plaintiff and\nplaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court approval. Ibid.\nThe City refused to submit its HAP in 1986; instead, counsel for\nthe United States prepared the HAP, which was deemed by the court\nto have been submitted by the City to HUD (6/9/86 letter,\nVanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87 Deft. Proposed Findings of\nFact & Conclusions of Law, 1 5). The City also refused to submit\nits fiscal year 1987 HAP until the court ordered it to do so\nunder penalty of contempt (7/1/87 Order).\n2. Part IV.B. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto execute a grant agreement with HUD within 15 days of the\nOrder. By executing the grant agreement, the City would formally\naccept the condition that its receipt of CDBG funds was dependent\nupon its submission of sites for public housing on the east side\nof Yonkers. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to execute the grant agreement, the\nplaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court\napproval. Ibid. The City refused to execute a grant agreement\nin 1986; instead, the grant agreement was prepared by counsel for\n\n-2-\nthe United States and deemed by the court to have been executed\nby the City (6/19/86 letter, Vanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87\nDeft. Proposed Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 1 6).\n3. Part IV.C. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit at least two sites for 140 units of public housing on\nthe east side of Yonkers within 30 days of the Order.\t Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The Order provided that if the City\nfailed to do so, three unused schools sites -- School 4, School\n15, and Walt Whitman School -- would be deemed to have been\nsubmitted. The City refused to designate any public housing\nsites. School 4, 15, and Whitman thus were automatically\ndesignated (R. 229, p. 3). HUD later approved only School 4 and\nWhitman for public housing (ibid.).\n4. Part IV.D. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit sites from a list of privately owned sites for 60\nadditional units of public housing within 90 days of the Order.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1581. The City took no action except to\nwrite letters to the owners of these sites, asking them if they\nwanted to sell their properties. The City did not designate any\nof these sites or exercise its power of eminent domain to obtain\nthem (id. at 3-4).\n5. Part VI. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit a plan for the development of additional subsidized\nhousing (the Long Term Plan) by November 15, 1986. The City\nrefused to do so (7/1/87 Order).\n\n-3-\n6. On December 5, 1986, the United States moved to have the\nCity held in contempt for its refusal to comply with the Housing\nRemedy Order. On December 9, the NAACP moved for the\nappointment of a special master to develop and implement the Long\nTerm Plan. On January 20, 1987, under threat of contempt, the\nCity Council passed a resolution agreeing to appoint an Outside\nHousing Advisor (OHA) to submit a Long Term Plan in compliance\nwith Part VI of the Housing Remedy Order and to seek additional\nsites for public housing (R. 233; 7/1/87 Order).\n7. At a hearing on April 9, 1987, the OHA gave an interim\nreport of his activities to the court and the parties. He stated\nthat he had identified as many as eighteen vacant sites in east\nYonkers which might be suitable for public housing and that the\nuse of these sites would allow for a more even distribution of\npublic housing and for less density than the existing plan to\nplace 100 units of public housing on the Whitman site and 60\nunits at School 4. Under this \"alternative plan,\" the OHA\nenvisioned approximately eight sites for public housing,\ndispersed throughout the east side of Yonkers (R. 246, pp. 1-15).\nThe court indicated its willingness to consider the adoption of\nsuch an alternative plan if specific sites were identified and\nassurances were given that the plan could be implemented\nexpeditiously (id. at 17). The court emphasized the need for\ncommunity support and its preference for allowing the City to\ndesign its own plan for complying with the Housing Remedy Order\n(id. at 30). On April 13, the court issued an order to show\n\n-4-\ncause why the Housing Remedy Order should not be amended, in\nlight of the OHA's interim report, in order to reduce the density\nof public housing on the Whitman site (4/13/87 Order).\n8. At a hearing on April 21, the City reported the\nadoption, on April 15, of City Council Resolution 19, which,\ninter alia, expressed the City Council's opposition to the\nexisting plan for public housing and advocated the adoption of\nthe alternative plan, whereby the 200 units of public housing\nwould be located on at least 6 sites in addition to Whitman and\nSchool 4, dispersed throughout all the wards in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (4/21/87 Court Exh. C). This resolution,\nhowever, conditioned the City's support, inter alia, on the\ngranting of a stay of construction pending appeal, and the\nlimitation of additional affordable housing under the Long Term\nPlan to 200 units (ibid.).\n9. At the same hearing, the OHA testified about the six\nsites which he was recommending for public housing, stating that\nhe expected that no more than 40 to 45 units would be placed on\nany one site (id. at 11-21). The OHA explained that one site\nwas owned by New York City and its use would require action by\nthe New York City Water Board. Two of the sites were owned by\nthe Yonkers School Board, and their use would require a\nreturning \nresolution by the School Board  the property to the\ni The City's motions for a stay of the Housing Remedy Order\npending appeal had been denied by the district court (R. 207), by\nthis Court (6/13/86 Order (No. 86-6136)) and by the Supreme Court\n(107 S. Ct. 10 (1986)).\n\n-5-\nCity. The remaining sites were owned by the City of Yonkers, but\nhad been transferred to the City by Westchester County for use as\nparkland. Their use for public housing, therefore, would\nrequire action by the County (ibid.).\n10. On May 8, 1987, the City moved to modify the Housing\nRemedy Order to provide for an alternative plan for the\ndevelopment of the 200 units of public housing, to be dispersed\nthroughout the east and northwest sections of Yonkers, on sites\nto be identified by the OHA, in consultation with site selection\ncommittees. The motion and the resolution upon which it was\nbased included the following conditions, inter alia: that all\nconstruction under the Housing Remedy Order would be stayed\npending appeal to the Supreme Court, and the Long Term Housing\nPlan would be limited to no more than 200 units of affordable\nhousing (5/8/87 Deft. Notice of Motion).\n11. At a hearing on the City's motion on May 12, the court\nagain emphasized its willingness to entertain the City's\nalternative proposals for the development of public housing under\nthe Housing Remedy Order, and expressed its preference that the\nremedy should embody the views of the affected community (R. 252,\npp. 12-14). In order to ensure that the City's proposal was not\nmerely a delay tactic, the court asked the City to take the\nfollowing actions to demonstrate its willingness to act to\nactually implement the plan: 1) the adoption of appropriate\nresolutions directed to the County and New York City, asking\nthose entities to make available the sites over which they had\n\n-6-\ncontrol; 2) the adoption of a resolution indicating the City's\nwillingness to make any necessary changes in zoning, etc. which\nmight be required to make the sites available for public\nhousing; and 3) a meeting between the City and the School Board\nto discuss the availability of the school sites for public\nhousing (id. at 15-18, 39-40). The court stated that the remedy\norder would not be amended until the City had specified sites,\nand any third parties, such as the County, had acted to make them\navailable. Informed at the end of the hearing that the City had\nnot passed its second year HAP, the court directed the City to do\nso as a prerequisite to further consideration of its motion (id.\nat 42-43).\n12. Through June 1987, the City had taken no action to try\nto gain control over the sites (R. 262, pp. 3, 54).\n13. On July 1, 1987, the court entered an order finding\n(7/1/87 Order):\nThe city of Yonkers has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy\nOrder. Instead, the City has delayed\nmeaningful remedial action and declined\nrepeated opportunities accorded to the City\nto act itself in the first instance in taking\nremedial action.\nThe July 1 Order, inter alia, required the City to take action to\ngain control over sites for both the public housing and the Long\nTerm Plan, under penalty of contempt and fines beginning at $100\nper day, to be doubled every day. The order specifically\nrequired the City, by July 15, 1987, to ask Westchester County to\nwaive its reverter interests in certain properties identified for\n\n-7-\nuse as potential assisted housing sites (id. at 1 10). Such\nrequest was to be submitted to the court and the parties before\nit was sent to the County (ibid.).\n14. On July 9, 1987, the City Council adopted 3\nresolutions, 2 of which were responsive to the court's July 1\nOrder, and 1 which was inconsistent with it. In Resolution 139-\n1987, the City Council adopted its FY 87 HAP, in compliance with\n¶ 14 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. A). In Resolution 140-\n1987, the City Council asked Westchester County to waive its\nreverter interest in specific sites designated by the OHA, in\ncompliance with ¶ 9 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. B). In\nResolution 141-1987, the City Council proposed an alternative\nplan which designated 8 specific sites for the 200 units of\npublic housing, and asked the County to waive its reverter rights\nas to 2 sites (R. 253, App. C). However, this request in\nResolution 141 was conditioned, inter alia, on the court's\ngranting of a stay pending appeal, limiting the numbers of units\non any given site, and limiting the number of units under the\nlong term plan to 200 units (100 new construction). The last\nparagraph of Resolution 141 stated that if any portion of the\nresolution was not complied with, the entire resolution would be\nnull and void (ibid.).\n15. In a conference July 9, the City's attorney represented\nthat Resolutions 139 and 140 had been adopted pursuant to the\nJuly 1 Order, and that Resolution 141 was intended as a proposed\nalternative plan (R. 263, pp. 4-5). The City's counsel stated\n\n-8-\nthat Resolution 141, with its conditions and qualifications, was\nnot intended to supersede the request to the County set forth in\nResolution 140 (id. at 14-16; see also R. 264, p. 4). The court\nstated that it would entertain the City's alternative plan if and\nwhen the City could show that it had obtained site control over\nall of the necessary sites; that it would entertain a motion for\na stay of construction pending appeal if and when it appeared\nthat construction was about to commence prior to a decision by\nthe Court of Appeals; and that any determination as to the number\nof units to be developed under the Long Term Plan, or as to any\nmix of public and market rate housing was premature (id. at 32-\n33; R. 253).\n16. On July 10, 1987, without notice to the court or the\nparties, the City wrote to Westchester County, asking it to\nwaive its reverter interest in the two sites identified in\nResolution 141, and enclosing a copy of Resolution 141 (R. 264,\npp. 2-3, 6-7). The court found that this letter had the effect\nof sending a message to the County that the City wanted the\nCounty to accept its alternative plan (with conditions) and to\nreject the request that the court had ordered it to make (id. at\n11-14). The court ordered the parties to draft a new letter to\nthe County retracting the July 10 letter from the City (id. at\n14-15) .\n17. On November 19, 1987, the County Board voted to refuse\nthe City's request that it release its reverter rights in the\nsites identified by the OHA.\n\n-9-\n18. On November 19, 1987, the court issued an order\nimposing a freeze on discretionary City actions \"in furtherance\nor implementation of\" four private development projects\nidentified by the OHA as having potential use toward\nimplementation of the Housing Remedy Order (R. 278). The freeze\nwas to be lifted if either of two events occurred: 1) if the\ncourt concluded that a given project could be of no utility in\nfurthering the housing remedy; or 2) if the City designated sites\nfor the 200 units of public housing (ibid.). In the November 19\norder, the court found (Order at 1-2):\nThe progress to date in identifying available\nsites has been extremely disheartening and\nthe attitude of the representatives of\nYonkers has been to do nothing affirmative,\nto place the entire onus of implementation\non the Court, and to engage in obstructive\nand dilatory tactics. To date, there have\nbeen untoward delays in implementing the\nHousing Remedy Order some 18 months after its\npromulgation. Only the threat of bankrupting\nfines has produced any action by the City.\n19. On December 15, 1987, the district court entered an\norder scheduling a status conference for January 11, 1988, and\nrequesting the attendance at that conference of the Mayor and\nmembers of the City Council of Yonkers. The Order stated that at\nthe conference, \"the Court will call upon the representatives of\nYonkers to advise what affirmative actions, if any, Yonkers is\ntaking or planning to take to implement the Housing Remedy\nOrder\" (12/15/87 Order).\n20. On December 28, 1987, this Court unanimously affirmed\nthe district court's liability and remedial determinations \"in\n\n- 10 -\nall respects.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d 1181, 1184. Following this\ndecision, the parties engaged in extensive negotiations aimed at\nresolution of the housing issues in the case.) These\nnegotiations resulted in agreement, on January 25, 1988, on the\nterms of a settlement. On that date, the district court\nannounced that, had such a settlement not been reached, it would\nhave entered an order requiring certain actions by the City of\nYonkers with regard to its obligations under the Housing Remedy\nOrder. The court also vacated its November 19, 1987 freeze\norder (1/25/88 Tr. 20, 23). On January 27, 1988, the City\nCouncil adopted the Consent Decree, which was entered by the\ndistrict court on January 28 (1/28/88 Tr. 2).\n22. Following entry of the Consent Decree, intense\ncommunity opposition to the housing remedy continued (3/21/88\nDeft. Motion to Amend). Some of this opposition centered on\nclaims that too many of the 200 public housing units were to be\nsited in southeast Yonkers (3/31/88 Tr. 54). In addition, it\nwas discovered that one of the public housing sites slated for 22\nunits could accommodate only 12 units. Consequently, the parties\nand the court discussed the possibility of designating an\nadditional public housing site (id. at 57-62).\n23. On March 21, 1988, the City moved the court to amend\nthe Consent Decree to delete that portion of the Decree in which\nit agreed not to petition for certiorari on the public housing\n21 \nBecause of these negotiations, the hearing scheduled for\nJanuary 11 was not held.\n\n- 11 -\nOrder. In support of this\naspect of the court's Housing Remedy \nmotion, the City cited the intense citizen opposition to the\nConsent Decree and, particularly, to the agreement not to pursue\nan appeal of the public housing remedy. Accompanying the City's\nmotion was a proposed order that provided for the entry of a\nof the United States\njudgment against the City in favor \ngovernment not to exceed $29.86 million should the Supreme Court\nultimately relieve the City of its obligation to provide sites\nfor the construction of 200 units of public housing. This amount\nrepresented the aggregate amount of CDBG funds received by the\nCity of Yonkers for fiscal years 1980-1987.1' The City's\nproposed order also provided, in case the City decided to stop\nany public housing construction that might have begun at the time\nof such Supreme Court action, for payment to the builder of one-\nand one-half times the profit it would have realized from\ncompletion of the development (3/21/88 Deft. Motion to Amend).\nThe district court denied the City's motion on March 31, 1988\n(3/31/88 Tr. 64), and the City has not appealed from that\nruling .\n24. At an April 12, 1988, meeting in chambers with the\ndistrict court and the parties, counsel for the City of Yonkers\ninformed the court and plaintiffs that the City of Yonkers was\n1' The City had previously obligated itself to provide sites for\nsuch housing in east Yonkers as a condition to the receipt of\nCDBG funds from the HUD. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580.\nA/ The court found that the City's motion Npander[ed] * * * to\nthose who were violently opposed to any and all public housing\"\n(3/31/88 Tr. 65).\n\n- 12 -\n\"not interested\" in completing negotiations on the terms of a\nlong term plan as required by Section 18 of the Consent Decree\n(5/2/88 Joint Motion of the United States and NAACP at 6). The\nApril 12 meeting, held to discuss implementation of the public\nhousing portion of the Consent Decree, took place after the court\nand the parties were \"advised by representatives of the City of\nYonkers that under no circumstances would the City Council\ndesignate an alternate site in Yonkers to substitute for any site\nin southeast Yonkers * * * despite the availability of an\nentirely acceptable site already approved by the parties and\ntentatively approved by HUD, in Northwest Yonkers, vacant and\nalready available\" (4/19/88 Tr. 3).\n25. On May 2, 1988, the City moved to vacate the Consent\nDecree, on the ground of alleged mutual mistake, claiming that\nthe parties' agreement had been contingent on the approval of the\nDecree by Cardinal O'Connor, which had since been withdrawn\n(5/2/88 Deft. Motion to Vacate).\n26. On May 19, 1988, at a hearing on the City's motion to\nvacate, the court offered the City time to confer with Cardinal\nO'Connor to determine whether another site could be designated in\nplace of a site owned by the Archdiocese, or to authorize the\ncourt to select an alternative site (5/19/88 Tr. 12-17). On May\n27, the City informed the district court that the City Council\nwould not submit an alternative site. The court denied the\nCity's motion to vacate the Consent Decree on June 8, finding\nthat, in light of the City's refusal to designate another site,\n\n- 13 -\nthe motion to vacate was \"a transparent ploy either to regain the\nright to appeal, and even more symbolically to avoid any\nresponsibility for the court decree or implementation of the\nhousing remedy order\" (6/8/88 Tr. 146).\n27. On June 14, 1988, the day after the Supreme Court\ndenied the City's petition for certiorari of this Court's\naffirmance of the district court's liability and remedy orders,\nthe City Council adopted Resolution 144-1988, imposing a\nmoratorium on all public housing construction in Yonkers\n(Addendum B).\n28. On June 28, 1988, the City Council adopted Resolution\n165-1988, calling for the termination of the City's condemnation\naction, taken pursuant to the Consent Decree, of that portion of\nthe St. Joseph's Seminary site designated for public housing\n(Addendum C). The preamble of this resolution stated, in part\n(ibid.):\nWHEREAS, the present Supreme Court\ndirected by a Judge who is acting as a\nphilosopher king in that he is illegally\nsocially engineering

Whether the district court erred in entering the Long\nTerm Plan Order and subsequent enforcement orders;\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding the City of\nYonkers in contempt for failing to comply with its orders;\n3. Whether the district court erred in holding four\nindividual council members in contempt;\n4. Whether the district court's contempt orders should be\nstayed pending the resolution of these appeals on the merits.\n\n-2-\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n4(cid:9)\nOn August 2, 1988, the district court adjudged the City Of\nYonkers (City) and three members of the Yonkers City Council\n(Fagan, Longo, and Chema) in civil contempt of court (8/2/88 Tr.\n21-24, 42, 62; 8/2/88 Order).V On August 4, a fourth member of\nthe City Council (Spallone) also was found in civil contempt\n(8/4/88 Order; 8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). These findings of contempt\nresulted from the City's and the Council members' refusal to\ncomply with remedial orders entered by the district court,\nincluding the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order (United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635 F. Supp. 1577 (S.D.N.Y. 1986),\naff'd, 837 F.2d 1181 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct.\n2821 (1988)); the January 28, 1988, Consent Decree, which was\napproved by the City Council and to which the City consented; the\nJune 13, 1988, Long Term Plan Order; and the July 26, 1988, Order\nissued by the district court seeking to enforce its previous\norders. In this Statement, we focus primarily upon the orders\nunder review and the proceedings which relate directly to those\norders. However, because the City's most recent refusals to\ncomply with the court's orders are a part of a pattern of\ncontemptuous conduct -- \"the latest of a series of contempts\"\nJ Because of the short briefing schedule, the record has not yet\nbeen filed in these appeals. However, this case has been before\nthis Court before and much of the record has been docketed in\nconnection with the pending consolidated appeal Nos. 87-6070 and\n88-6078. Where possible, we refer to documents in that record by\nrecord number (\"R.\"). Documents that are not already docketed in\nthis Court are identified by date and title. It is our\nunderstanding that counsel for the City will be providing copies\nof such documents to the Court after the briefs have been filed.\n\n- 3 -\ns\n(8/2/88 Tr. 23) -- we have set forth as Addendum A_to this brief\na record of the court's efforts to enforce its housing remedy\nto comply with those orders over\norders, and the City's failure \nthe last two years.\nA. The liability and remedy orders\nOn November 20, 1985, the district court found the City\nliable for intentional housing segregation, in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair\nHousing Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et sea. United\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 624 F. Supp. 1276, 1289-1376\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985).21 Following remedial proceedings, the district\ncourt entered its Housing Remedy Order on May 28, 1986. Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. 1577. This Court affirmed the district court's\nliability and remedy orders \"in all respects\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184.\nIn its liability opinion, the district court found that the\nCity had deliberately concentrated virtually all of its public\nand other subsidized housing in the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers, and had done so to maintain residential segregation in\nthe city. Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1289-1376. One of the bases\n21 \nThe district court also found the City and the Yonkers Board\nof Education liable for intentionally segregating the Yonkers\npublic schools, Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1537, 1545, and ordered\nthe City to fund a system-wide desegregation plan to be\nimplemented by the Board. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1583. This\nCourt upheld the school liability findings and remedy orders.\nYonkers,.837 F.2d at 1184. The City's appeals of the district\ncourt's denial of its motion to modify the school remedy to\ndelete the requirement that it fund the construction of two new\nschools are now pending before this Court (Nos. 87-6070, 88-6078).\n\n-4-\nfor the district court's liability findings was the City's\ndeference to the extreme, race-based public opposition that\ndeveloped whenever subsidized housing was proposed outside of\nsouthwest Yonkers. Id. at 1294-1300, 1306-1307, 1314-1316,\n1362-1363, 1369. This Court specifically affirmed this basis\nfor liability. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1221-1226.\nPart VI of the district court's May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy\nOrder required the City to develop and implement a Plan for the\ncreation of subsidized housing outside the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers (the Long Term Plan).(cid:9) Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1582.\nThe district court expressly declined to set a goal for the\nnumber of assisted housing units to be provided, to establish a\ntimetable for the development of such housing, or to prescribe\nthe mechanisms by which such housing should be provided. Ibid.;\nR. 149, p. 6. Rather, it left to the City both the opportunity\nand the responsibility for proposing the substance of the Long\nTerm Plan. The Order required the City to submit its proposed\nPlan no later than November 15, 1986. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at\n1582.\nPart IV of the Housing Remedy Order required the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of public housing in east Yonkers.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The public housing aspect of\nthe remedy is not directly at issue in this appeal, although the\nCity's noncompliance with that portion of the Housing Remedy\nOrder forms part of the background to the district court's\nfindings of contempt here (see Addendum A). Related appeals\nwhich grew out of the public housing aspect of the remedy orders\nin this case are pending before this Court (Yonkers Racing Coro.\nv. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6140; St. Joseph's Seminary and\nCollege v. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6146).\n\n-5-\nThe City refused to submit such a proposal, and stated to\nthe court by letter dated November 14, 1986, that \"it is not\nanticipated that a plan will  be submitted to the Court in\naccordance with Part VI of the Order\" (11/14/86 Letter, Sculnick\nat 4-5). \nto Judge Sand; 7/1/87 Order  On December 5, 1986, the\nUnited States moved to have the City held in contempt, and on\nDecember 9, the NAACP moved for the appointment of a special\nmaster to carry out the City's responsibilities. Rather than\nimposing such sanctions, in early 1987, the district court\npermitted the City to appoint an Outside Housing Advisor (OHA) to\nprepare its Long Term Plan proposal (7/1/87 Order; R. 233).A/\nB. The Consent Decree\nIn January 1988, following this Court's affirmance of the\ndistrict court's liability and remedial decisions, the parties\nentered into negotiations designed to resolve outstanding issues\nrelating to compliance with the original housing remedy order,\nA/ Over the next months, much of the time and energies of the OHA\nand the parties were devoted to the public housing aspects of the\nHousing Remedy Order (see Addendum A, 117-19). On July 1, 1987,\nthe district court found that the City \"has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy Order. Instead the\nCity has delayed meaningful remedial action and declined repeated\nopportunities accorded to the City to act itself in the first\ninstance in taking remedial action\" (7/1/87 Order  at 1-2). The\ncourt ordered the City to take a number of actions relating to\nboth the Long Term Plan and the public housing aspects of the\nremedy order (id. at 2-6), and ruled that its failure to comply\nwould result in a finding of contempt and the imposition of fines\nof $100 per day, doubled every day until the City complied (}\nat 6-7). The City complied with the letter of the July 1 Order\nbut not with its spirit (see Addendum A, 11 13-17). In\nSeptember, the OHA submitted his suggestions for a Long Term\nPlan, and the parties filed comments on the OHA's submissions in\nJanuary 1988.\n\n-6-\nincluding the Long Term Plan. After weeks of negotiations, the\nin\nparties reached agreement on the First Remedial Consent Decree \nEquity (Consent Decree), which was approved by the City Council\non January 27, and entered by the district court on January 28,\n1988 (1/28/88 Consent Decree).\nSections 12 through 18 of the Consent Decree, entitled\n\"Assisted Housing,\" set forth the basic outlines of the Long Term\nPlan (id. at 7-11). The Decree set a long term goal of 800\nunits of assisted housing to be developed over 4 years  (id. at\n7), \"in conjunction with or as part of\" developments of market\nrate housing (id. at 8). In Section 17 of the Consent Decree,\nthe City agreed to adopt \"Mandated Incentives,\" including\nlegislation establishing various incentives designed to encourage\nthe development of such housing by private developers  (id. at 9-\n10).J The Decree required the City to adopt such legislation\nJ Section 17 of the Consent Decree provides, in pertinent part\n(id. at 9-10):\nThe City agrees to adopt, among other\nthings, legislation (a) conditioning the\nconstruction of all multi-family housing\n* * * on the inclusion of at least 20\npercent assisted units; (b) granting\nnecessary tax abatements to housing\ndevelopments constructed under the terms of\nthe legislation referred to in clause (a);\n(c) granting density bonuses to such\ndevelopers; (d) providing for zoning changes\nto allow the placement of such developments,\nprovided, however, that such changes are not\nsubstantially inconsistent with the character\nof the area; and (e) other provisions upon\nwhich the parties may subsequently agree\n* * *,\n\n-7-\n\"as promptly as practicable but, in no event, later than 9Q days\nafter\" January 28, 1988, i.e., by April 27, 1988 (ibid.).\nSection 18 of the Decree required the parties to negotiate a\nsecond consent decree by February 15, 1988, with regard to the\nunresolved details of the Long Term Plan (ibid.).\nOn March 21, citing intense public opposition to the remedy,\nthe City moved to modify the Consent Decree (3/21/88 Deft.\nMotion to Amend). In connection with that motion, the City\nstated its willingness to refund more than $29 million in\nfederal funds that it had received since 1980, if it were\nrelieved of its obligation to provide sites for public housing in\neast Yonkers, as required by the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (see Addendum A, q 23). The court denied the\nmotion (3/31/88 Tr. 64).\nC. The Long Term Plan Order\nPursuant to the Consent Decree, the parties began\nnegotiations on the details of the Long Term Plan in February.\nDrafts of the Plan were prepared by counsel for the City.\nHowever, the City broke off negotiations in April after the\nplaintiffs would not agree to amend the Consent Decree and the\ncourt denied the City's motion for such amendment (see Addendum\nA, 11 23, 24). On May 2, 1988, the United States and the NAACP\nsubmitted to the court a proposed Long Term Plan Order, which was\nbased upon the draft that had been prepared by the City's\nlawyers, and which largely reflected the parties' agreements\nreached during negotiations (5/2/88 Joint Motion at 4-8).\n\n- 8 -\nConsistent with the outline of the Plan set forth in the  Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7-11), the plaintiffs' proposed\norder contemplated a program of incentives and City actions\ndesigned to induce private developers to develop affordable\nhousing, in combination with market rate housing, in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (5/2/88 Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenors'\nProposed Long Term Plan Order). The proposed order granted the\nCity discretion to establish the mix of Mandated Incentives which\nit would make available to each developer, and set forth examples\nof the types of Mandated Incentives which the City would\nimplement (id. at 10-12). The United States and the NAACP also\nsubmitted joint amended comments setting forth the rationale for\neach aspect of their proposed order (5/2/88 Plaintiff and\nPlaintiff-Intervenors' Joint Amended Long Term Plan Comments).\nThe City opposed the plaintiffs' proposed order. In\naddition to opposing entry of any Long Term Plan Order on the\nground that it had moved to vacate the Consent Decree (see\nAddendum A, ¶% 25-26), the City stated three specific objections\nto the plaintiffs' proposed order:\n(a) its requirement that all multi-family\nhousing be built in at least an 080/20\"\nconfiguration is excessively restrictive, and\nthe city proposes that the order contain a\nvariance procedure for permitting less than\n20% assisted units (though not less than 10%)\nin any development;\n(b) its failure to provide for any\nefficiency or one bedroom units in the\naffordable price categories is contrary to\nthe evidence that a need for such units\nexists; and\n\n-9-\n(C) no new Office of Implementation is\nappropriate or necessary, since existing City\nshould be given the\nagencies and resources \nresponsibility of implementing the plan.\n(5/16/88 City's Memorandum In Opposition to Plaintiffs' Joint\nProposed Long-Term Plan at 3). In addition, the\nMotion to Enter \nCity suggested specific changes in the provisions regarding\nresale restrictions, architectural integration, mandated\nincentives, and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (id. at 4).\nThe City stated that the \"overall thrust\" of its proposed\nchanges was \"to give greater flexibility to the City to respond\naffirmatively to development proposals which do not meet all of\nthe specific restrictions\" in the plaintiffs' proposed order\n(id. at 19). In opposing the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office, the City emphasized its preference for\nretaining responsibility for implementation of the Plan in\nexisting City agencies (id. at 13-16).\nThe district court then requested the plaintiffs to submit a\nrevised proposed order reflecting, to the extent agreeable to the\nplaintiffs, the City's comments on the plaintiffs' initial\nproposal. Plaintiffs submitted such a revised proposal on June\n2, 1988. Following argument on June 8 (6/8/88 Tr. 146-183), the\nLong Term Plan Order was entered, as further modified by the\ncourt, on June 13, 1988 (6/13/88 Long Term Plan Order).\nThe court's order included a number of modifications to the\nplaintiffs' proposed order, in response to the City's objections\nrelating to the minimum percentage of subsidized units in a\ndevelopment (id. at 2), provision for some one-bedroom units (id.\n\n- 10 -\nat 3), architectural integration (id. at 9-10), and permissible\nuses of funds from the Affordable Housing Trust  Fund (i_ at 13-\n14). The court's order also included a provision giving priority\nto developer proposals that would \"assure the provision of\nassisted housing in a dispersed manner and so to  avoid the undue\nconcentration of both public and assisted units in any\nneighborhood of Yonkers\" (id. at 4). The City's objections to\nthe order that were not accepted by the court involved the\ncreation of an Implementation Office to implement the Plan\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178-180), the use of tax abatements (id. at 177-178),\nand the reduction of the transfer restriction for housing\ndeveloped under the Plan from 30 to 20 years (id. at 178).\nThe City has appealed the entry of the June 13 Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nD. Enforcement of the Consent Decree\nand Long Term Plan Order\nAs of June 13, more than four months after entry of the\nConsent Decree, and more than one month after the deadline to\nwhich it had agreed, the City had failed to pass the legislation\nrequired by Section 17 of the Decree. On June 17, with the Long\nTerm Plan Order entered, and thus the specific content of the\nnecessary legislation established, the United States asked the\nCourt to set a timetable for the legislation's enactment (6/21/88\nJ The 30-year restriction originated in the drafts prepared by\nthe City during negotiations, and was reflected in similar plans\nof a number of New Jersey towns which had been submitted by the\nCity during negotiations (6/8/88 Tr. 155). The City\nacknowledged at argument that the dispute on this issue was \"hard\nto resolve on the merits\" (id. at 178).\n\n- 11 -\nCourt Exh. A). In a telephone conference, counsel for the City\nstated that a consulting firm had been retained to draft  the\nfor\nappropriate legislation, that a draft would be available \nreview by the plaintiffs and the OHA by July 19, and that City\nCouncil action could be anticipated at the next City Council\nmeeting -- perhaps in August (6/21/88 Tr. 3). The district\ncourt expressed its concern about continued delay and requested\nthe City Council to pass a resolution adopting the provisions of\nthe Consent Decree and the Long Term Plan Order (id. at 3-4,\n21\n20).  Counsel for the City drafted such a resolution\n\"indicating [the City Council's] commitment to the\nimplementation of\" the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree,\nand the Long Term Plan Order (Res. No. 177-1988). On June 28,\n1988, the Yonkers City Council voted, 5 to 1, to reject the\nresolution (ibid.).\nFollowing this action, the district court directed the\nplaintiffs to prepare a proposed order \"requiring Yonkers to take\nspecific implementing action pursuant to a prescribed time-table,\non penalty of a finding of contempt and the imposition of\nbankrupting fines\" (6/29/88 Order).0 On July 5, 1988,\nplaintiffs submitted such a proposed order, setting forth a\nL The court indicated that it was particularly concerned in\nlight of a resolution passed by the City Council the previous\nweek declaring a moratorium on the development of all public\nhousing in the City of Yonkers, despite the provisions of the\nHousing Remedy Order and the Consent Decree requiring the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of such housing (6/21/88 Tr. 4, 18;\nsee Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\nJ' The City has appealed the entry of the June 29 Order.\n\n- 12 -\ntimetable for City actions and providing that failure  to take\nsuch actions would Subject the City to possible contempt\nSanctions (7/5/88 Plaintiffs' Notice of Motion and Proposed\nOrder) .\nIn its memorandum opposing entry of the proposed order, the\nCity stated that \"the City has indicated by the defeat of the\n[June 28] Resolution * * * that it will not voluntarily adopt the\nlegislation contemplated by [the Long Term Plan] Order\" (7/12/88\nCourt Exh. A at 4). The City argued that, rather than imposing\ncontempt sanctions on the City for its refusal to comply with the\ncourt's orders, the court should simply \"enter an order adopting\nthe necessary\" legislation (id. at 3).\nAt the hearing on July 12, the district court solicited the\nparties' comments on the possible creation by the court of an\nAffordable Housing Commission, which would exercise all of the\nCity Council's functions relating to the implementation of the\nhousing remedy orders (7/12/88 Tr. 6-9). In written comments,\nthe United States opposed the creation of such a commission\nbecause it would allow the City and its officials to avoid their\nobligation to comply with the lawful housing remedy orders of the\ndistrict court and allow them to continue to inflame community\nopposition to the court's orders (7/22/88 Comments of the United\nStates). The City stated that it could not support the creation\nof a commission because it was concerned about divesting its City\nCouncil of its \"core legislative as well as executive functions\"\n\n- 13 -\n(7/25/88 city's Comments at 2). The NAACP supported the concept\nof a commission (7/22/88 Brief of NAACP).\nQn July 26, at the United States' urging, the district court\nentered an Order requiring the City, on or before August 1, to\nenact the legislation implementing the Long Term Plan, as\nrequired by Section 17 of the Consent Decree and in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88 Order).\nconsultants\nSuch legislation had been drafted by the City's own \nand incorporated the terms of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 2-6; 7/26/88 Court Exh. A). The City stated that it had no\nobjections to the proposed legislation except for those it had\npreviously expressed regarding the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 6; see pp. 8-10, supra). The July 26 Order provided that the\nCity's failure to enact the legislation, and to demonstrate why\nit should not be held in contempt at a show cause hearing on\nAugust 2, would subject the City to contempt and daily fines\nuntil it enacted the legislation.V The fines to be imposed were\nset at $100 for the first day of noncompliance with the daily\nrate doubling for each consecutive day of noncompliance (7/26/88\n21 \nThe City subsequently advised the district court of state\nprocedural requirements of notice and public hearing prior to the\nenactment of zoning ordinances which purportedly would have made\nit impossible for the City to adopt the ordinance at issue by\nAugust 1. By letter dated July 28, the Court clarified its order\nand advised the parties that its July 26 order would be satisfied\nif the City Council adopted a resolution on or before August 1\ncommitting itself to enact the ordinance within the minimum time\nprescribed for notice pursuant to state law (7/28/88 Letter from\nJudge Sand to All Counsel). The City has filed a notice of\nappeal from the July 28 letter. At its August 1 meeting the\nCity Council scheduled the required hearing on the legislation\nfor August 15 (8/2/88 Tr. 2).\n\n- 14 -\na(cid:9) Order at 2-3). In addition, if the legislation were not passed,\nfailed to vote for it, and failed\nmembers of the City Council who \nto demonstrate why they should not be held in contempt at the\nAugust 2 show cause hearing, would be held in contempt, fined\n$500 per day of noncompliance, and imprisoned after ten days of\nnoncompliance (id. at 3_4).1QJ The City has appealed the July\n26 Order.\nOn August 1, by a vote of 4 to 3, the City Council defeated\nthe resolution called for by the July 26 Order, as clarified by\nthe July 28 letter (8/2/88 Tr. 2). On August 2, the Court held\nthe City in contempt and imposed fines on the schedule set out in\nthe July 26 order. The City's lawyer reiterated its argument\nthat the court should order the legislation into effect, rather\nthan holding the City in contempt for refusing to enact it  (id.\nat 3). The court found that the City had been given adequate\nnotice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard (id. at\n23). In holding the City in contempt, the court found that the\n\"extent of the resistance by the City * * * is unprecedented\"\n(id. at 22), and that \"this is but the latest of a series of\ncontempts\" (id. at 23). The City has appealed from this contempt\norder.\nThe court also heard, on August 2, from three of the four\nCouncil members who had voted against the legislation.\nCouncilmen Fagan and Longo stated that they had voted against the\nThe individual sanctions would terminate if the legislation\n.1-QJ \nwere passed or if the individuals voted for the legislation\n(7/26/88 Order at 3-4).\n\n- 15 -\nlegislation because there had been no public hearing or\nopportunity for input from the public (id. at 40-42).\nCouncilman Chema gave no explanation for his vote. His attorney\ncontended that he had not had adequate opportunity to  prepare,\nbut did not subsequently take advantage of the court's offer to\nhold an evidentiary hearing the following week (id. at 44-54, 58-\n61). The court found that all three had had adequate notice and\nfound them in contempt (id. at 42, 62). The court gave each of\nthe individuals until August 5 to request an evidentiary hearing,\nset August 8 as the date for such a hearing if requested, and\nruled that the individuals' checks would not be cashed pending\nthe outcome of such a hearing (id. at 56-60). None of the\nindividuals requested an evidentiary hearing. Fagan, Longo, and\nChema have appealed the contempt orders.\nThe proceedings with respect to Councilman Spallone were\nadjourned until August 4 to enable him to retain counsel.(cid:9) On\nthat date, the court found that Spallone had had adequate notice\nof the court's order and of the consequences of his violation of\nthat order,i J and that he had deliberately violated the order\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35). Spallone's defense was that the court lacked\nthe power to order him to vote in a particular way and that he\nwas not bound to comply with the Consent Decree because he had\n11 Spallone, like the other Council members, was given the\noption of requesting an evidentiary hearing to be held on August\n8 (8/2/88 Tr. 63).\n.221 Spallone had been in court on July 26 when the order was\nentered (8/4/88 Tr. 4).\n\n- 16 -\nnot voted for it in January (id. at 7-8, 10-13, 28-29, 31). The\ncourt heard uncontradicted evidence that Spallone had made a\nnumber of statements indicating that he would not comply with the\ncourt's orders (id. at 24-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A). The court\nfound that no factual issues were in dispute and held him in\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). \ncontempt  Spallone has appealed the contempt\norder.\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt orders until argument of these appeals on the merits on\nAugust 17.\nARGUMENT\nThis Court affirmed the district court's May 28, 1986,\nHousing Remedy Order as \"plainly reasonable,\" \"necessary,\" and\n\"appropriate and prudent,\" particularly in light of \"[t]he City's\npast history of foot-dragging (e. g., nine years taken to approve\nsites for 750 units) and its refusals to approve any site for\nlow-income housing outside\" minority areas. United States v.\nYonkers Board of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1236-1237 (1987). Now,\nafter two more years in which the City has continued to delay\ncompliance and actively to defy the district court's remedy\norders -- and during which the court has given the City every\nopportunity to comply voluntarily -- the court has found the City\nin contempt and has imposed escalating fines designed to coerce\nthe City's compliance. As the district court stated (8/2/88 Tr.\n22-23):\nIt would be difficult to imagine a clearer\nchallenge to the constitution of the United\n\n- 17 -\nStates and to a government of law than that\ncourt\npresented this morning. If a federal \nto remedy racial\norder designed \ndiscrimination can be flouted by a\nbecause that is what appears to\nmunicipality \nbe the course of political expediency, then\na  form\nwe no longer live under  constitutional \nof government. Then one has to put an\nasterisk to the constitution and say,\n\"Provided, however, that if the community is\nsufficiently hostile to remedial action\ndesigned to insure and protect these rights,\nthen all bets are off.\"\nAs set forth below, the district court acted properly in\nentering the Long Term Plan Order; in imposing the contempt\nsanctions designed to coerce compliance with its orders; and in\nfinding the City and four members of the City Council in civil\ncontempt. The district court's orders should be affirmed and no\nfurther stay of the district court's contempt orders should be\ngranted.\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ENTERING THE LONG TERM PLAN ORDER\nA district court has \"substantial latitude\" in devising\nremedies for constitutional violations. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1236. On appeal, the reviewing court must \"acknowledge the\nrespect owed a District Judge's judgment that specified relief is\nessential to cure a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\"\nUnited States v. Paradise, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1073 (1987); and the\nchoice of remedies is entrusted \"'to the sound discretion of the\ntrial court.'\" Ibid., quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S.\n448, 508 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring), quoting Franks v.\n\n- 18 -\nBowman Trans. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 794 (1976) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). The district court\nhere did not abuse its discretion in entering the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nThe City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan  for the\ndevelopment of affordable housing outside the southwest quadrant\nof Yonkers was part of the original Housing Remedy Order and, as\nsuch, has already been upheld by this Court.  Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184. The Consent Decree, to which the City agreed and is\nindisputably bound, established the framework for and resolved\nthe most controversial issues relating to the Long Term Plan.\nThe Consent Decree set a goal of 800 units of privately developed\nassisted housing, to be developed in conjunction with market rate\nhousing over a four-year period, and committed the City to enact\nlegislation to effectuate the Plan (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7).\nThus, the City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan, and to\nenact legislation, in accordance with the Housing Remedy Order\nand the Consent Decree, is the law of the case and is not open to\nfurther review. See Crane Co. v. American Standard, Inc., 603\nF.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir. 1979).\nThe Consent Decree left the details of the Long Term Plan to\nfurther negotiations. However, after agreement had been reached\non a basic draft, the City broke off negotiations for reasons\nunrelated to the Long Term Plan itself (see p. 7, supra). Thus,\nin order to effectuate the Consent Decree, the plaintiffs were\nforced to submit a proposed Long Term Plan Order to the court for\n\n- 19 -\nentry. The court obtained the City's comments on the proposed\norder and heard argument on the disputed issues. on June 13 it\nentered an Order that was fully consistent with both the Housing\nRemedy Order and the Consent Decree, that largely reflected\nagreements which had been reached among the parties during\ntook \nnegotiations, and that  into account most of the objections\nexpressed by the City (see pp. 7-10, supra).\nMoreover, the City's remaining objections to the Order were\nrelatively minor and somewhat ambiguous. 13 The City contended\nthat resale restrictions on housing developed under the Plan\nshould be limited to 20 years, rather than 30. However, the 30-\nyear restriction had initially been proposed by the City and was\nfound in many of the municipal plans used as models for the Long\nTerm Plan during negotiations. The City's lawyer acknowledged at\nargument that this dispute was \"hard to resolve on the merits\"\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178). The City also objected to the Order's\nprovisions regarding the use of tax abatements, claiming that\nthey were inconsistent with state law. However, the City had\nspecifically agreed to grant tax abatements in the Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 9), and the City's lawyer\nstated at argument that the question of state law \"would require\nadditional study\" and contended only that granting tax\n1J \nThe City also contended that the Long Term Plan Order should\nnot be entered because it was based on the Consent Decree, which\nthe City had moved to vacate (see p. 8, supra). The court's\ndenial of the City's motion to vacate, which has not been\nappealed, vitiates that basis for objection to the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\n\n- 20 -\nabatements in the manner contemplated by the Order would be\n\"unfair\" to other residents of Yonkers (id. at 177-178).\nFinally, the City objected to the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office to administer the Plan, and argued that\nsuch responsibility should be vested in existing City agencies\n(id. at 178-180). However, the court found that, in light of\nthe City's history of obstructing the development of assisted\nhousing, a separate Implementation Office was appropriate to\nshield the implementation of the Plan from political interference\n(id. at 179).14\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\noverruling the City's objections to the proposed Order and in\nentering the June 13 Long Term Plan Order.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ISSUING ITS JUNE 29 AND JULY 26 ORDERS\nOn June 28, 1988, in response to a direct request from the\ncourt, the City Council refused to commit itself to complying\nwith the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long\n141 Neither the City nor any of the individual Council members\ncontent \ncited these objections to the  of the Long Term Plan Order\nas a reason for their refusal to enact the resolution on August\n1. See pp. 14-16, supra.\n\n- 21 -\nTerm Plan Order. 15 The City was already two months past the\ndate on which the Consent Decree required it to enact the\nimplementing legislation for the Long Term Plan. The Housing\nRemedy Order was more than two years old and, due to the City's\nobstruction and delay, no housing construction had begun.\nAgainst this background, the court issued its  June 29 Order\ndirecting the plaintiffs to submit a proposed order setting forth\na timetable for City compliance, and contempt sanctions in case\nof noncompliance. After submission of the proposed order, and\ncomments from the City, the court entered its July 26 Order.l6\nThat order required the City to enact the legislation necessary\nto implement the Long Term Plan Order, and declared that if the\nlegislation was not passed by August 1, the City and the members\nof the City Council who failed to vote for it would be required\nto show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt. A\nfinding of contempt would result in escalating fines for the\nCity, beginning at $100 per day and doubling every day, and fines\nof $500 per day for the individual Council members, who would\nalso be subject to imprisonment after 10 days of noncompliance.\n15 On the same date, the City Council adopted a resolution\ncalling for the withdrawal of the City's condemnation action for\none of the public housing sites designated by the Consent Decree\n(Addendum A, 1 28; Addendum C). One week earlier, the City\nCouncil had adopted a resolution declaring a moratorium on the\nconstruction of all public housing in the city, in defiance of\nthe public housing aspects of the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\n16 The court also considered, as an alternative or supplement to\ncontempt sanctions, the creation of a commission which would take\nover all of the executive and legislative functions of the City\nCouncil relating to the housing remedy (see pp. 12-13, supra).\n\n- 22 -\nA district court is vested with \"wide discretion\" in\nfashioning remedies to coerce compliance with its orders.\nVuitton et Fils S.A. v. Carousel Handba gs, 592 F.2d 126, 130 (2d\nCir. 1979). The district court did not abuse that discretion in\nissuing the June 29 and July 26 orders here.\ndid not err in selecting\nA. The district court \ncivil contempt as the appropriate sanction\nfor the City's noncompliance\nThe court's orders contemplated the imposition of civil\ncontempt sanctions, designed to coerce compliance with its\norders. This approach is well grounded in the law:\nOnce issued, an injunction may be enforced..\nMany of the court's most effective\nenforcement weapons involve financial\npenalties. * * * Civil contempt proceedings\nmay yield a conditional jail term or fine.\n* * * If a state agency refuses to adhere to\na court order, a financial penalty may be the\nmost effective means of insuring compliance.\nHutto V.F inney, 437 U.S. 678, 690-691 (1978) (citations\nomitted).\nThe purpose of civil contempt fines is to coerce a party to\ncomply with the court's orders. Local 28. Sheet Metal Workers v.\nEEOC, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 3033 (1986); McComb v. Jacksonville Paper\nCo., 336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949); Northside Realty Assocs. v. United\nStates, 605 F.2d 1348, 1356 (5th Cir. 1979) (contempt of\ninjunction under the Fair Housing Act). A party subject to such\ncoercive sanctions holds within its hands the power to end the\nsanctions by simply ceasing its contumacious conduct.  See\nShillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 368 (1966); United\nStates v. Handler, 476 F.2d 709, 714 (2d Cir. 1973). Here the\n\n- 23 -\nfines will end as soon as the City enacts the ordinance (or a\nresolution committing itself to enact the ordinance at the\nearliest possible time) as required by the district court's\norders. The dilemma of potentially bankrupting fines facing the\nCity is thus one of its own making and one which it has full\npower to avoid.\nThe City argued below that the court should have chosen a\ndifferent remedy for its noncompliance, and should have simply\nordered the legislation into effect)r2J But a court has no\nobligation to revise its prior orders -- particularly in a manner\ninconsistent with a consent decree the parties bargained for and\nobtained -- merely because a party decides not to comply.JJ\nMoreover, the City's alternative would not have addressed the\nunderlying problem here: the City's repeated refusal to obey the\ncourt's orders. It is the City, not the court, which has chosen\nthis confrontation. It is the City which has flouted the law.\nill This argument was inconsistent with the position adopted by\nthe City regarding the Long Term Plan Order. In urging the court\nnot to require it to create a separate Implementation Office, the\nCity argued that maximum responsibility should be retained by\nthe City's existing agencies (see pp. 8-9, su pra). In addition,\nthe City opposed the creation of a commission to carry out the\nCity Council's responsibilities because it would divest it of\n\"core legislative as well as executive functions\" (7/25/88 City's\nComments at 2).\nIn any case, direct judicial exercise of the legislative\nfunction would be more, not less intrusive than directing City\nofficials to exercise their responsibilities in accordance with\nthe court's remedy orders. The path now recommended by the City\ncould only ultimately lead to continuous judicial management of\nthe City's affairs. Contempt is the classic means of achieving\ncompliance with court orders and is better tailored to that end\nthan the City's suggested remedy.\n\n- 24 -\nIt is the City that must now comply with the law. As the\ndistrict court stated (8/2/88 Tr. 8-9):\n[T]here does have to come a moment of truth,\na moment of reckoning, a moment when the City\nof Yonkers seeks not to become a national\nsymbol of defiance to civil rights and to\nheap shame upon shame upon itself, but to\nrecognize its obligation to conform to the\nlaws of the land and not step by step, order\nby order, but in the way in which any\nresponsible community concerned about the\nwelfare of its citizens functions. That is\nnot going to be accomplished by this court\nadopting the ordinance.\nUnder the district court's orders, implementation of the\nLong Term Plan Order and the necessary legislation still rests\nsubstantially with City officials, including the City Council,\nwhere it belongs. The City, at long last, must be required to\nmeet its legal obligations under the court's remedial orders.\nThe court did not abuse its discretion in determining to impose\ncivil contempt sanctions to compel such compliance.\nB. The level of fines imposed upon the City were\nan appropriate means of coercing compliance\nThe district court has struggled with the City's\nextraordinary willingness to delay and obstruct the\nimplementation of the remedy and to defy the court's orders for\nmore than two years. The district court was thus in the best\nposition to determine the most effective means of securing the\nCity's compliance. The court's judgment regarding  the size of\nfines against the City and the nature and extent of the sanctions\nagainst contemptuous City officials is entitled to considerable\ndeference from this Court. Vuitton, supra.\n\n- 25 -\nCertainly the fines set by the July 26 Order will mount to\nbankrupting levels in a short time if the City continues to defy\nthe court's orders. Yet to be effective in  coercing this City's\ncompliance, any fines must be quite severe. The City is already\non record as being willing to refund over $29 million dollars to\ncompliance with the public\nthe federal government to avoid \nhousing aspect of the remedy, and to sell bonds in order to raise\nthat sum (see p. 7, supra, and Addendum A, 1 23). Thus the City\nis willing to pay an extremely high price to avoid the\ndevelopment of assisted housing in east Yonkers. Fines which\ngrew-more slowly would only succeed in compelling compliance more\nslowly, but would surely have to reach the same high levels\nbefore the City would finally comply.\nHere, the fines start at a very low level, thus allowing the\nCity Council some days to reflect and to change its course, or\nfor other authorities to intervene, 19 before a bankruptcy\noccurs. A different fine schedule -- for example, $100,000 per\nday -- might well be insufficient to compel compliance if the\nCity Council elected to try to sell bonds, levy  taxes or\notherwise raise the money to pay for its continued defiance. The\ndistrict court's schedule of fines does not allow the City time\nfor such tactics. That the fines here will rise at an\nescalating rate means only that the time for such reflection will\nend sooner rather than later, and that the City will finally\nThe City is subject to supervision by an Emergency Financial\nControl Board, which has broad powers over its finances. See\n7/22/88 Comments of the United States at 7-12.\n\n- 26 -\ncomply with the court's orders sooner rather than later. While a\ndifferent level of fines might, at first blush, appear less\nharmful to the citizens of Yonkers, the district court's order\nbetter serves the interests of justice and of  Yonkers residents\nbecause it ensures a rapid resolution to this controversy.\nThe Supreme Court approved the use of much harsher civil\ncontempt fines in United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S.\n258, 304-305 (1947), when it upheld a coercive fine of $2.8\nmillion dollars -- in 1947 dollars -- imposed on a union. More\nrecently, the Court has held that contemptuous conduct, including\na history of \"persistent or egregious discrimination\" and\n\"'foot-dragging resistance' to court orders\" may authorize the\ngranting of extraordinary relief where other methods fail, even\nwhere innocent third-parties may suffer. Local 28, 106 S. Ct. at\n3050, 3051. Indeed, here no party need suffer at all if the City\nsimply complies with the court's orders.\nZQJ In its stay papers in this Court, the City argued that the\nfines here violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth\nAmendment (City's Reply Memorandum at 5). However, the Eighth\nAmendment applies only to criminal proceedings and thus is\nirrelevant to civil contempt sanctions. In graham v. Wright, 430\nU.S. 651, 664 (1977); see Uphaus V. Wyman, 360 U.S. 72 (1959);\nUnited States v. Dien, 598 F.2d 743, 745 (2d Cir. 1979) (Eighth\nAmendment inapplicable to coercive imprisonment imposed as civil\ncontempt sanction).\n\n- 27 -\nThe court did not err in setting the schedule of fines for\nthe City at $100 per day, doubling every day.J\nC.

As set forth above (pp. 17-20, supra), the\ncourt did not err in entering the Long Term Plan Order, which\nsupplied the content of the legislation. In order to ensure that\nits remedy orders would be implemented -- and the City's housing\nviolations at long last remedied -- the court was also authorized\nto order the City to enact the legislation.\nAs this Court has held, a court's power to \"restructure the\noperation of state and local entities\" is \"flexible but not\nunlimited.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1235.

Citing Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 191 F. Supp.\n871 (E.D. La.) (3-judge court), aff'd, sub nom., Dennyv. Bush,\n367 U.S. 908 (1961) (per curiam), this Court distinguished such a\ncase from the traditional application of legislative immunity in\na private Section 1983 action:\nThat case [Bush] involved an entirely\ndifferent set of circumstances from that in\n23 The alternative belatedly proposed by the City -- direct\njudicial exercise of the Council's legislative authority to adopt\nthe plan -- would have been a far greater intrusion on\nlegislative prerogative. Indeed, when the court suggested an\nindependent Commission be created that could exercise the City's\n\"core legislative\" function, the City objected (see pp. 12-13,\nsupra). Under the circumstances, it is impossible to reconcile\nthe City's positions (1) that the July 26 order unduly interferes\nwith its legislative prerogative, but that (2) judicial\nassumption of its legislative function in this area is\npermissible (and even preferable).\nThus, whatever its applicability to the City Council and\nCouncil members here, legislative immunity provides no shield for\nthe City itself.\n\n- 30 -\nthe present case. The injunction was granted\nnot pursuant to a private § 1983 civil action\nbut on a motion by the United States to\nvindicate the authority of a federal court.\nIt attacked an \"obvious\" pattern of \"delay,\nevasion, obstruction, defiance and reprisal.\"\nstar Distributors, Ltd., 613 F.2d at 10.

Supp. at 879. As in Bush, the district court here\nwas faced with \"an 'obvious' pattern of 'delay, evasion,\nobstruction, defiance and reprisal\" on the part of the City of\nYonkers and its City Council. Its orders requiring the City to\ncomply with the Long Term Plan Order and the Consent Decree -- in\nwhich the City had agreed to enact the legislation at issue --\nwere entirely proper. Legislative immunity cannot shield\nlegislators from sanctions for their blatant disregard for lawful\ncourt orders.\nIII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE CITY IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the City had adequate notice of the\ncourt's July 26 order, as modified by its July 28 letter. Nor is\nthere any dispute that the City failed to comply with that order.\nIndeed there can be no dispute that the City has violated the\nHousing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long Term Plan\nOrder. The City seeks to avoid contempt by arguing for the first\ntime in this litigation that the City as a corporate entity\n\n- 31 -\nshould be distinguished from the City Council, and that the City\nC\nshould not be forced to pay for the irresponsibility of some of\nits Council members.\nSuch a dichotomy finds no support in the law or in common\nsense. The City Council acts for the City. Like all municipal\ncorporations, the City functions through its governing bodies,\nand the official actions of the governing body constitute actions\nof the City:\nIf the decision to adopt that particular\ncourse of action is properly made by that\ngovernment's authorized decisionmakers, it\nsurely represents an act of official\ngovernment \"policy\" as that term is commonly\nunderstood. More importantly, where action\nis directed by those who establish\ngovernmental policy, the municipality is\nequally responsible * * *.\nPembaur V. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481 (1986) (footnote\nomitted); see also City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 108 S. Ct.\n915 (1988). Indeed, the City's original liability in this case\nwas based in part upon the actions and inactions of the City\nCouncil and individual Council members. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1188-1194, 1221-1223.\nBy adopting the Consent Decree, the City Council bound the\nCity to obey its mandates. The City cannot now avoid those\nobligations by seeking to separate itself from the only entity\nempowered to enact the legislation necessary to comply with the\nDecree. There is no authority to support the notion that a\ngovernmental entity itself cannot be held accountable if its\nofficials fail to carry out lawful court orders.\n\n- 32 -\nNor did the City's objection to entry of the Long Term Plan\nOrder justify its refusal to comply. First, the obligation to\nenact the legislation was derived from the Consent Decree, to\nwhich the City was a party. Second, as we have demonstrated (pp.\n17-20, supra), the entry of the Long Term Plan Order was entirely\nproper. Third, none of the Council members who voted against the\nresolution even mentioned the City's previously stated objections\nto the content of the Long Term Plan Order as a basis for their\nvotes. Most importantly, disagreement with a court's order does\nnot justify its violation:\n[There is] impressive authority for the\nproposition that an order issued by a court\nwith jurisdiction over the subject matter and\nperson must be obeyed by the parties until it\nis reversed by orderly and proper\nproceedings * * *. \"'* * * It is for the\ncourt of first instance to determine the\nquestion of the validity of the law, and\nuntil its decision is reversed for error by\norderly review, either by itself or by a\nhigher court, its orders based on its\ndecision are to be respected, and\ndisobedience of them is contempt of its\nlawful authority, to be punished.\"\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 293 (citations omitted).

City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 316\n(1967). Nor can refusal to comply with a federal court order be\ndefended by claims of the \"political difficulties\" of\ncompliance. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d 33, 37 (2d Cir.\n1986), cert. denied, 107 S. Ct. 955 (1987).\nThus the City was properly found in contempt of court.\n\n- 33 -\nIV\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the individual Council members had\nnotice of the July 26 order (as modified by the  July 28 letter),\nthe\nthat they violated that order by failing to vote for \nresolution, or that they had adequate opportunity to  be heard\nprior to the court's contempt findings.(cid:9) Nor is there any\ndoubt that the Council members were bound by the court's orders.\nIn committing the City to the Consent Decree, the City Council\nbound itself to its terms.(cid:9) Pursuant to Rule 65(d) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, an injunction is binding upon\nthe parties to an action and their \"officers, agents, servants,\n[and] employees.\" As the Court stated in United States v. City\nof Providence, 492 F. Supp. 602, 610 (D.R.I. 1980):\n[A]lthough no City officers are specifically\nbefore the Court, the Decree is specifically\nbinding upon them, and * * * they also might\nbe brought before the Court and be required\nto adhere to the provisions of the Amended\nConsent Decree.\nSee pp. 14-16, supra. In addition, as the district court\nruled on August 2, the City Council members received adequate\nnotice of the possible need for counsel at the contempt hearing\n(8/2/88 Tr. 31-32, 44-52). Thus, any claim of inadequate time\nfor preparation by counsel for the hearing due to last minute\nretention by any Council member must be rejected. In any event,\nthe district court offered to hold an additional hearing if any\nCouncil member so requested (id. at 58-62).\n26 The fact that the January 28, 1988, judgment was entered by\nconsent does not lessen the respect due that judgment by the City\nand the City Council. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d at 38.\n\n- 34 -\n%\t See also Shakman v. Democratic Ora., 533 F.2d 344, 352 (7th Cir.)\ncert. denied, 429 U.S. 858 (1976).\nWhere civil contempt is concerned, the inquiry ends here.\nThe intent of the individual Council members or their motivation\nfor disobeying the district court's mandate are irrelevant to\nthat court's finding of civil contempt. The Supreme Court held\nin McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. at 191 (citations\nand footnote omitted):\nThe absence of wilfulness does not relieve\nfrom civil contempt. Civil as distinguished\nfrom criminal contempt is a sanction to\nenforce compliance with an order of the\ncourt * * *. Since the purpose is remedial,\nit matters not with what intent the defendant\ndid the prohibited act. The decree was not\nfashioned so as to grant or withhold its\nbenefits dependent on the state of mind of\nrespondents.\nSee SEC v. American Board of Trade. Inc., 830 F.2d 431, 441 (2d\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct. 1118 (1988); Donovan v.\nSovereign Security. Ltd., 726 F.2d 55, 59 (2d Cir. 1984). In any\ncase, it cannot be disputed that the City Council members here\ndid willfully violate the court's order (see 8/2/88 Tr. 41-42,\n62; 8/4/88 Tr. 23-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A).\nThe district court did not err in holding the City Council\nmembers in contempt.\nV\nNO ADDITIONAL STAY OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S\nCONTEMPT ORDERS SHOULD BE GRANTED\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt order 'only until the appeals are argued on Wednesday,\n\n- 35 -\nAugust 17, 1988\" (8/9/88 Order). When that stay was issued, this\nCourt had not had the opportunity to hear the merits of these\nappeals. Now, however, the merits have been fully briefed and,\nas we have demonstrated above, the district court's orders were\nentirely justified. Because there is no substantial possibility\nthat the appellants will succeed on the merits, no further stay\nshould be granted. 27 Indeed, we urge this Court to affirm the\ndistrict court's orders forthwith.\nNeither the City nor the Council members can show that they\nwill be irreparably harmed if no further stay is granted. Each\nhas the ability to purge the contempt, and avoid any harm, by the\nsimple act of complying with the district court's orders.\nIndeed, any further delay in the enforcement of the contempt\norders would irreparably harm the public interest and the\ninterests of the plaintiffs here because it would permit the City\nand the Council members to continue to violate the district\ncourt's orders with impunity. For more than two years the City\nhas defied the court's authority. This nearly total disrespect\nfor the judicial process continues today and will continue as\nThe standards for granting a stay pending appeal are well\nestablished. A movant must show that there is a substantial\npossibility that it will prevail on the merits of its appeal,\nthat it will be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted, and\nthat granting a stay will not irreparably harm the nonmoving\nparties or the public interest. Dubose v. Pierce, 761 F.2d 913,\n920 (2d Cir. 1985), vacated on other grounds, 108 S. Ct. 2890\n(1988), citing Coleman v. Paccar. Inc., 424 U.S. 1301, 1305\n(1976) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice), and O'Brien v. Brown, 409\nU.S. 1, 3 (1972) (per curiam).\n\n- 36 -\nlong as the contempt order is stayed. As the Supreme Court has\nstated:\n[R]espect for judicial process is a small\nprice to pay for the civilizing hand of law,\nwhich alone can give abiding meaning to\nconstitutional freedom.\nWalker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. at 321. A stay of the\ncontempt order would stay \"the civilizing hand of law\" and\nirreparably harm the public interest.\nA stay also would further delay the implementation of the\nremedy and the vindication of the constitutional rights of the\ncitizens of Yonkers to equal opportunity in housing, and would\nfurther delay the enforcement of the nation's civil rights laws\nin Yonkers. In Griffin, 377 U.S. at 234, the Supreme Court\ndeclared that \"(t]he time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run\nout.\" Here, the time for the City of Yonkers to comply with the\ncourt's orders has run out. If this Court does not affirm\nbefore the stay expires, certainly it should not extend the stay.\n\n- 37 -\nCONCLUSION\n11\nFor the reasons stated above, the  district court's orders\nshould be affirmed forthwith.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

Thorne\nAttorney\n\nADDENDUM A\n\nADDENDUM A\n1. Part IV.A. of the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order\nrequired the City to submit its Housing Assistance Plan  (HAP) to\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within 15\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635\ndays of the Order. United \nF. Supp. 1577, 1580 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). The submission of such a\nHAP was a prerequisite to the City's receipt of Community\nDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Ibid. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to submit a HAP, the plaintiff and\nplaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court approval. Ibid.\nThe City refused to submit its HAP in 1986; instead, counsel for\nthe United States prepared the HAP, which was deemed by the court\nto have been submitted by the City to HUD (6/9/86 letter,\nVanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87 Deft. Proposed Findings of\nFact & Conclusions of Law, 1 5). The City also refused to submit\nits fiscal year 1987 HAP until the court ordered it to do so\nunder penalty of contempt (7/1/87 Order).\n2. Part IV.B. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto execute a grant agreement with HUD within 15 days of the\nOrder. By executing the grant agreement, the City would formally\naccept the condition that its receipt of CDBG funds was dependent\nupon its submission of sites for public housing on the east side\nof Yonkers. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to execute the grant agreement, the\nplaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court\napproval. Ibid. The City refused to execute a grant agreement\nin 1986; instead, the grant agreement was prepared by counsel for\n\n-2-\nthe United States and deemed by the court to have been executed\nby the City (6/19/86 letter, Vanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87\nDeft. Proposed Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 1 6).\n3. Part IV.C. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit at least two sites for 140 units of public housing on\nthe east side of Yonkers within 30 days of the Order.\t Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The Order provided that if the City\nfailed to do so, three unused schools sites -- School 4, School\n15, and Walt Whitman School -- would be deemed to have been\nsubmitted. The City refused to designate any public housing\nsites. School 4, 15, and Whitman thus were automatically\ndesignated (R. 229, p. 3). HUD later approved only School 4 and\nWhitman for public housing (ibid.).\n4. Part IV.D. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit sites from a list of privately owned sites for 60\nadditional units of public housing within 90 days of the Order.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1581. The City took no action except to\nwrite letters to the owners of these sites, asking them if they\nwanted to sell their properties. The City did not designate any\nof these sites or exercise its power of eminent domain to obtain\nthem (id. at 3-4).\n5. Part VI. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit a plan for the development of additional subsidized\nhousing (the Long Term Plan) by November 15, 1986. The City\nrefused to do so (7/1/87 Order).\n\n-3-\n6. On December 5, 1986, the United States moved to have the\nCity held in contempt for its refusal to comply with the Housing\nRemedy Order. On December 9, the NAACP moved for the\nappointment of a special master to develop and implement the Long\nTerm Plan. On January 20, 1987, under threat of contempt, the\nCity Council passed a resolution agreeing to appoint an Outside\nHousing Advisor (OHA) to submit a Long Term Plan in compliance\nwith Part VI of the Housing Remedy Order and to seek additional\nsites for public housing (R. 233; 7/1/87 Order).\n7. At a hearing on April 9, 1987, the OHA gave an interim\nreport of his activities to the court and the parties. He stated\nthat he had identified as many as eighteen vacant sites in east\nYonkers which might be suitable for public housing and that the\nuse of these sites would allow for a more even distribution of\npublic housing and for less density than the existing plan to\nplace 100 units of public housing on the Whitman site and 60\nunits at School 4. Under this \"alternative plan,\" the OHA\nenvisioned approximately eight sites for public housing,\ndispersed throughout the east side of Yonkers (R. 246, pp. 1-15).\nThe court indicated its willingness to consider the adoption of\nsuch an alternative plan if specific sites were identified and\nassurances were given that the plan could be implemented\nexpeditiously (id. at 17). The court emphasized the need for\ncommunity support and its preference for allowing the City to\ndesign its own plan for complying with the Housing Remedy Order\n(id. at 30). On April 13, the court issued an order to show\n\n-4-\ncause why the Housing Remedy Order should not be amended, in\nlight of the OHA's interim report, in order to reduce the density\nof public housing on the Whitman site (4/13/87 Order).\n8. At a hearing on April 21, the City reported the\nadoption, on April 15, of City Council Resolution 19, which,\ninter alia, expressed the City Council's opposition to the\nexisting plan for public housing and advocated the adoption of\nthe alternative plan, whereby the 200 units of public housing\nwould be located on at least 6 sites in addition to Whitman and\nSchool 4, dispersed throughout all the wards in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (4/21/87 Court Exh. C). This resolution,\nhowever, conditioned the City's support, inter alia, on the\ngranting of a stay of construction pending appeal, and the\nlimitation of additional affordable housing under the Long Term\nPlan to 200 units (ibid.).\n9. At the same hearing, the OHA testified about the six\nsites which he was recommending for public housing, stating that\nhe expected that no more than 40 to 45 units would be placed on\nany one site (id. at 11-21). The OHA explained that one site\nwas owned by New York City and its use would require action by\nthe New York City Water Board. Two of the sites were owned by\nthe Yonkers School Board, and their use would require a\nreturning \nresolution by the School Board  the property to the\ni The City's motions for a stay of the Housing Remedy Order\npending appeal had been denied by the district court (R. 207), by\nthis Court (6/13/86 Order (No. 86-6136)) and by the Supreme Court\n(107 S. Ct. 10 (1986)).\n\n-5-\nCity. The remaining sites were owned by the City of Yonkers, but\nhad been transferred to the City by Westchester County for use as\nparkland. Their use for public housing, therefore, would\nrequire action by the County (ibid.).\n10. On May 8, 1987, the City moved to modify the Housing\nRemedy Order to provide for an alternative plan for the\ndevelopment of the 200 units of public housing, to be dispersed\nthroughout the east and northwest sections of Yonkers, on sites\nto be identified by the OHA, in consultation with site selection\ncommittees. The motion and the resolution upon which it was\nbased included the following conditions, inter alia: that all\nconstruction under the Housing Remedy Order would be stayed\npending appeal to the Supreme Court, and the Long Term Housing\nPlan would be limited to no more than 200 units of affordable\nhousing (5/8/87 Deft. Notice of Motion).\n11. At a hearing on the City's motion on May 12, the court\nagain emphasized its willingness to entertain the City's\nalternative proposals for the development of public housing under\nthe Housing Remedy Order, and expressed its preference that the\nremedy should embody the views of the affected community (R. 252,\npp. 12-14). In order to ensure that the City's proposal was not\nmerely a delay tactic, the court asked the City to take the\nfollowing actions to demonstrate its willingness to act to\nactually implement the plan: 1) the adoption of appropriate\nresolutions directed to the County and New York City, asking\nthose entities to make available the sites over which they had\n\n-6-\ncontrol; 2) the adoption of a resolution indicating the City's\nwillingness to make any necessary changes in zoning, etc. which\nmight be required to make the sites available for public\nhousing; and 3) a meeting between the City and the School Board\nto discuss the availability of the school sites for public\nhousing (id. at 15-18, 39-40). The court stated that the remedy\norder would not be amended until the City had specified sites,\nand any third parties, such as the County, had acted to make them\navailable. Informed at the end of the hearing that the City had\nnot passed its second year HAP, the court directed the City to do\nso as a prerequisite to further consideration of its motion (id.\nat 42-43).\n12. Through June 1987, the City had taken no action to try\nto gain control over the sites (R. 262, pp. 3, 54).\n13. On July 1, 1987, the court entered an order finding\n(7/1/87 Order):\nThe city of Yonkers has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy\nOrder. Instead, the City has delayed\nmeaningful remedial action and declined\nrepeated opportunities accorded to the City\nto act itself in the first instance in taking\nremedial action.\nThe July 1 Order, inter alia, required the City to take action to\ngain control over sites for both the public housing and the Long\nTerm Plan, under penalty of contempt and fines beginning at $100\nper day, to be doubled every day. The order specifically\nrequired the City, by July 15, 1987, to ask Westchester County to\nwaive its reverter interests in certain properties identified for\n\n-7-\nuse as potential assisted housing sites (id. at 1 10). Such\nrequest was to be submitted to the court and the parties before\nit was sent to the County (ibid.).\n14. On July 9, 1987, the City Council adopted 3\nresolutions, 2 of which were responsive to the court's July 1\nOrder, and 1 which was inconsistent with it. In Resolution 139-\n1987, the City Council adopted its FY 87 HAP, in compliance with\n¶ 14 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. A). In Resolution 140-\n1987, the City Council asked Westchester County to waive its\nreverter interest in specific sites designated by the OHA, in\ncompliance with ¶ 9 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. B). In\nResolution 141-1987, the City Council proposed an alternative\nplan which designated 8 specific sites for the 200 units of\npublic housing, and asked the County to waive its reverter rights\nas to 2 sites (R. 253, App. C). However, this request in\nResolution 141 was conditioned, inter alia, on the court's\ngranting of a stay pending appeal, limiting the numbers of units\non any given site, and limiting the number of units under the\nlong term plan to 200 units (100 new construction). The last\nparagraph of Resolution 141 stated that if any portion of the\nresolution was not complied with, the entire resolution would be\nnull and void (ibid.).\n15. In a conference July 9, the City's attorney represented\nthat Resolutions 139 and 140 had been adopted pursuant to the\nJuly 1 Order, and that Resolution 141 was intended as a proposed\nalternative plan (R. 263, pp. 4-5). The City's counsel stated\n\n-8-\nthat Resolution 141, with its conditions and qualifications, was\nnot intended to supersede the request to the County set forth in\nResolution 140 (id. at 14-16; see also R. 264, p. 4). The court\nstated that it would entertain the City's alternative plan if and\nwhen the City could show that it had obtained site control over\nall of the necessary sites; that it would entertain a motion for\na stay of construction pending appeal if and when it appeared\nthat construction was about to commence prior to a decision by\nthe Court of Appeals; and that any determination as to the number\nof units to be developed under the Long Term Plan, or as to any\nmix of public and market rate housing was premature (id. at 32-\n33; R. 253).\n16. On July 10, 1987, without notice to the court or the\nparties, the City wrote to Westchester County, asking it to\nwaive its reverter interest in the two sites identified in\nResolution 141, and enclosing a copy of Resolution 141 (R. 264,\npp. 2-3, 6-7). The court found that this letter had the effect\nof sending a message to the County that the City wanted the\nCounty to accept its alternative plan (with conditions) and to\nreject the request that the court had ordered it to make (id. at\n11-14). The court ordered the parties to draft a new letter to\nthe County retracting the July 10 letter from the City (id. at\n14-15) .\n17. On November 19, 1987, the County Board voted to refuse\nthe City's request that it release its reverter rights in the\nsites identified by the OHA.\n\n-9-\n18. On November 19, 1987, the court issued an order\nimposing a freeze on discretionary City actions \"in furtherance\nor implementation of\" four private development projects\nidentified by the OHA as having potential use toward\nimplementation of the Housing Remedy Order (R. 278). The freeze\nwas to be lifted if either of two events occurred: 1) if the\ncourt concluded that a given project could be of no utility in\nfurthering the housing remedy; or 2) if the City designated sites\nfor the 200 units of public housing (ibid.). In the November 19\norder, the court found (Order at 1-2):\nThe progress to date in identifying available\nsites has been extremely disheartening and\nthe attitude of the representatives of\nYonkers has been to do nothing affirmative,\nto place the entire onus of implementation\non the Court, and to engage in obstructive\nand dilatory tactics. To date, there have\nbeen untoward delays in implementing the\nHousing Remedy Order some 18 months after its\npromulgation. Only the threat of bankrupting\nfines has produced any action by the City.\n19. On December 15, 1987, the district court entered an\norder scheduling a status conference for January 11, 1988, and\nrequesting the attendance at that conference of the Mayor and\nmembers of the City Council of Yonkers. The Order stated that at\nthe conference, \"the Court will call upon the representatives of\nYonkers to advise what affirmative actions, if any, Yonkers is\ntaking or planning to take to implement the Housing Remedy\nOrder\" (12/15/87 Order).\n20. On December 28, 1987, this Court unanimously affirmed\nthe district court's liability and remedial determinations \"in\n\n- 10 -\nall respects.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d 1181, 1184. Following this\ndecision, the parties engaged in extensive negotiations aimed at\nresolution of the housing issues in the case.) These\nnegotiations resulted in agreement, on January 25, 1988, on the\nterms of a settlement. On that date, the district court\nannounced that, had such a settlement not been reached, it would\nhave entered an order requiring certain actions by the City of\nYonkers with regard to its obligations under the Housing Remedy\nOrder. The court also vacated its November 19, 1987 freeze\norder (1/25/88 Tr. 20, 23). On January 27, 1988, the City\nCouncil adopted the Consent Decree, which was entered by the\ndistrict court on January 28 (1/28/88 Tr. 2).\n22. Following entry of the Consent Decree, intense\ncommunity opposition to the housing remedy continued (3/21/88\nDeft. Motion to Amend). Some of this opposition centered on\nclaims that too many of the 200 public housing units were to be\nsited in southeast Yonkers (3/31/88 Tr. 54). In addition, it\nwas discovered that one of the public housing sites slated for 22\nunits could accommodate only 12 units. Consequently, the parties\nand the court discussed the possibility of designating an\nadditional public housing site (id. at 57-62).\n23. On March 21, 1988, the City moved the court to amend\nthe Consent Decree to delete that portion of the Decree in which\nit agreed not to petition for certiorari on the public housing\n21 \nBecause of these negotiations, the hearing scheduled for\nJanuary 11 was not held.\n\n- 11 -\nOrder. In support of this\naspect of the court's Housing Remedy \nmotion, the City cited the intense citizen opposition to the\nConsent Decree and, particularly, to the agreement not to pursue\nan appeal of the public housing remedy. Accompanying the City's\nmotion was a proposed order that provided for the entry of a\nof the United States\njudgment against the City in favor \ngovernment not to exceed $29.86 million should the Supreme Court\nultimately relieve the City of its obligation to provide sites\nfor the construction of 200 units of public housing. This amount\nrepresented the aggregate amount of CDBG funds received by the\nCity of Yonkers for fiscal years 1980-1987.1' The City's\nproposed order also provided, in case the City decided to stop\nany public housing construction that might have begun at the time\nof such Supreme Court action, for payment to the builder of one-\nand one-half times the profit it would have realized from\ncompletion of the development (3/21/88 Deft. Motion to Amend).\nThe district court denied the City's motion on March 31, 1988\n(3/31/88 Tr. 64), and the City has not appealed from that\nruling .\n24. At an April 12, 1988, meeting in chambers with the\ndistrict court and the parties, counsel for the City of Yonkers\ninformed the court and plaintiffs that the City of Yonkers was\n1' The City had previously obligated itself to provide sites for\nsuch housing in east Yonkers as a condition to the receipt of\nCDBG funds from the HUD. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580.\nA/ The court found that the City's motion Npander[ed] * * * to\nthose who were violently opposed to any and all public housing\"\n(3/31/88 Tr. 65).\n\n- 12 -\n\"not interested\" in completing negotiations on the terms of a\nlong term plan as required by Section 18 of the Consent Decree\n(5/2/88 Joint Motion of the United States and NAACP at 6). The\nApril 12 meeting, held to discuss implementation of the public\nhousing portion of the Consent Decree, took place after the court\nand the parties were \"advised by representatives of the City of\nYonkers that under no circumstances would the City Council\ndesignate an alternate site in Yonkers to substitute for any site\nin southeast Yonkers * * * despite the availability of an\nentirely acceptable site already approved by the parties and\ntentatively approved by HUD, in Northwest Yonkers, vacant and\nalready available\" (4/19/88 Tr. 3).\n25. On May 2, 1988, the City moved to vacate the Consent\nDecree, on the ground of alleged mutual mistake, claiming that\nthe parties' agreement had been contingent on the approval of the\nDecree by Cardinal O'Connor, which had since been withdrawn\n(5/2/88 Deft. Motion to Vacate).\n26. On May 19, 1988, at a hearing on the City's motion to\nvacate, the court offered the City time to confer with Cardinal\nO'Connor to determine whether another site could be designated in\nplace of a site owned by the Archdiocese, or to authorize the\ncourt to select an alternative site (5/19/88 Tr. 12-17). On May\n27, the City informed the district court that the City Council\nwould not submit an alternative site. The court denied the\nCity's motion to vacate the Consent Decree on June 8, finding\nthat, in light of the City's refusal to designate another site,\n\n- 13 -\nthe motion to vacate was \"a transparent ploy either to regain the\nright to appeal, and even more symbolically to avoid any\nresponsibility for the court decree or implementation of the\nhousing remedy order\" (6/8/88 Tr. 146).\n27. On June 14, 1988, the day after the Supreme Court\ndenied the City's petition for certiorari of this Court's\naffirmance of the district court's liability and remedy orders,\nthe City Council adopted Resolution 144-1988, imposing a\nmoratorium on all public housing construction in Yonkers\n(Addendum B).\n28. On June 28, 1988, the City Council adopted Resolution\n165-1988, calling for the termination of the City's condemnation\naction, taken pursuant to the Consent Decree, of that portion of\nthe St. Joseph's Seminary site designated for public housing\n(Addendum C). The preamble of this resolution stated, in part\n(ibid.):\nWHEREAS, the present Supreme Court\ndirected by a Judge who is acting as a\nphilosopher king in that he is illegally\nsocially engineering

Whether the district court erred in entering the Long\nTerm Plan Order and subsequent enforcement orders;\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding the City of\nYonkers in contempt for failing to comply with its orders;\n3. Whether the district court erred in holding four\nindividual council members in contempt;\n4. Whether the district court's contempt orders should be\nstayed pending the resolution of these appeals on the merits.\n\n-2-\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n4(cid:9)\nOn August 2, 1988, the district court adjudged the City Of\nYonkers (City) and three members of the Yonkers City Council\n(Fagan, Longo, and Chema) in civil contempt of court (8/2/88 Tr.\n21-24, 42, 62; 8/2/88 Order).V On August 4, a fourth member of\nthe City Council (Spallone) also was found in civil contempt\n(8/4/88 Order; 8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). These findings of contempt\nresulted from the City's and the Council members' refusal to\ncomply with remedial orders entered by the district court,\nincluding the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order (United States\nv. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635 F. Supp. 1577 (S.D.N.Y. 1986),\naff'd, 837 F.2d 1181 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct.\n2821 (1988)); the January 28, 1988, Consent Decree, which was\napproved by the City Council and to which the City consented; the\nJune 13, 1988, Long Term Plan Order; and the July 26, 1988, Order\nissued by the district court seeking to enforce its previous\norders. In this Statement, we focus primarily upon the orders\nunder review and the proceedings which relate directly to those\norders. However, because the City's most recent refusals to\ncomply with the court's orders are a part of a pattern of\ncontemptuous conduct -- \"the latest of a series of contempts\"\nJ Because of the short briefing schedule, the record has not yet\nbeen filed in these appeals. However, this case has been before\nthis Court before and much of the record has been docketed in\nconnection with the pending consolidated appeal Nos. 87-6070 and\n88-6078. Where possible, we refer to documents in that record by\nrecord number (\"R.\"). Documents that are not already docketed in\nthis Court are identified by date and title. It is our\nunderstanding that counsel for the City will be providing copies\nof such documents to the Court after the briefs have been filed.\n\n- 3 -\ns\n(8/2/88 Tr. 23) -- we have set forth as Addendum A_to this brief\na record of the court's efforts to enforce its housing remedy\nto comply with those orders over\norders, and the City's failure \nthe last two years.\nA. The liability and remedy orders\nOn November 20, 1985, the district court found the City\nliable for intentional housing segregation, in violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair\nHousing Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et sea. United\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 624 F. Supp. 1276, 1289-1376\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985).21 Following remedial proceedings, the district\ncourt entered its Housing Remedy Order on May 28, 1986. Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. 1577. This Court affirmed the district court's\nliability and remedy orders \"in all respects\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184.\nIn its liability opinion, the district court found that the\nCity had deliberately concentrated virtually all of its public\nand other subsidized housing in the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers, and had done so to maintain residential segregation in\nthe city. Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1289-1376. One of the bases\n21 \nThe district court also found the City and the Yonkers Board\nof Education liable for intentionally segregating the Yonkers\npublic schools, Yonkers, 624 F. Supp. at 1537, 1545, and ordered\nthe City to fund a system-wide desegregation plan to be\nimplemented by the Board. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1583. This\nCourt upheld the school liability findings and remedy orders.\nYonkers,.837 F.2d at 1184. The City's appeals of the district\ncourt's denial of its motion to modify the school remedy to\ndelete the requirement that it fund the construction of two new\nschools are now pending before this Court (Nos. 87-6070, 88-6078).\n\n-4-\nfor the district court's liability findings was the City's\ndeference to the extreme, race-based public opposition that\ndeveloped whenever subsidized housing was proposed outside of\nsouthwest Yonkers. Id. at 1294-1300, 1306-1307, 1314-1316,\n1362-1363, 1369. This Court specifically affirmed this basis\nfor liability. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1221-1226.\nPart VI of the district court's May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy\nOrder required the City to develop and implement a Plan for the\ncreation of subsidized housing outside the southwest quadrant of\nYonkers (the Long Term Plan).(cid:9) Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1582.\nThe district court expressly declined to set a goal for the\nnumber of assisted housing units to be provided, to establish a\ntimetable for the development of such housing, or to prescribe\nthe mechanisms by which such housing should be provided. Ibid.;\nR. 149, p. 6. Rather, it left to the City both the opportunity\nand the responsibility for proposing the substance of the Long\nTerm Plan. The Order required the City to submit its proposed\nPlan no later than November 15, 1986. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at\n1582.\nPart IV of the Housing Remedy Order required the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of public housing in east Yonkers.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The public housing aspect of\nthe remedy is not directly at issue in this appeal, although the\nCity's noncompliance with that portion of the Housing Remedy\nOrder forms part of the background to the district court's\nfindings of contempt here (see Addendum A). Related appeals\nwhich grew out of the public housing aspect of the remedy orders\nin this case are pending before this Court (Yonkers Racing Coro.\nv. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6140; St. Joseph's Seminary and\nCollege v. City of Yonkers, No. 88-6146).\n\n-5-\nThe City refused to submit such a proposal, and stated to\nthe court by letter dated November 14, 1986, that \"it is not\nanticipated that a plan will  be submitted to the Court in\naccordance with Part VI of the Order\" (11/14/86 Letter, Sculnick\nat 4-5). \nto Judge Sand; 7/1/87 Order  On December 5, 1986, the\nUnited States moved to have the City held in contempt, and on\nDecember 9, the NAACP moved for the appointment of a special\nmaster to carry out the City's responsibilities. Rather than\nimposing such sanctions, in early 1987, the district court\npermitted the City to appoint an Outside Housing Advisor (OHA) to\nprepare its Long Term Plan proposal (7/1/87 Order; R. 233).A/\nB. The Consent Decree\nIn January 1988, following this Court's affirmance of the\ndistrict court's liability and remedial decisions, the parties\nentered into negotiations designed to resolve outstanding issues\nrelating to compliance with the original housing remedy order,\nA/ Over the next months, much of the time and energies of the OHA\nand the parties were devoted to the public housing aspects of the\nHousing Remedy Order (see Addendum A, 117-19). On July 1, 1987,\nthe district court found that the City \"has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy Order. Instead the\nCity has delayed meaningful remedial action and declined repeated\nopportunities accorded to the City to act itself in the first\ninstance in taking remedial action\" (7/1/87 Order  at 1-2). The\ncourt ordered the City to take a number of actions relating to\nboth the Long Term Plan and the public housing aspects of the\nremedy order (id. at 2-6), and ruled that its failure to comply\nwould result in a finding of contempt and the imposition of fines\nof $100 per day, doubled every day until the City complied (}\nat 6-7). The City complied with the letter of the July 1 Order\nbut not with its spirit (see Addendum A, 11 13-17). In\nSeptember, the OHA submitted his suggestions for a Long Term\nPlan, and the parties filed comments on the OHA's submissions in\nJanuary 1988.\n\n-6-\nincluding the Long Term Plan. After weeks of negotiations, the\nin\nparties reached agreement on the First Remedial Consent Decree \nEquity (Consent Decree), which was approved by the City Council\non January 27, and entered by the district court on January 28,\n1988 (1/28/88 Consent Decree).\nSections 12 through 18 of the Consent Decree, entitled\n\"Assisted Housing,\" set forth the basic outlines of the Long Term\nPlan (id. at 7-11). The Decree set a long term goal of 800\nunits of assisted housing to be developed over 4 years  (id. at\n7), \"in conjunction with or as part of\" developments of market\nrate housing (id. at 8). In Section 17 of the Consent Decree,\nthe City agreed to adopt \"Mandated Incentives,\" including\nlegislation establishing various incentives designed to encourage\nthe development of such housing by private developers  (id. at 9-\n10).J The Decree required the City to adopt such legislation\nJ Section 17 of the Consent Decree provides, in pertinent part\n(id. at 9-10):\nThe City agrees to adopt, among other\nthings, legislation (a) conditioning the\nconstruction of all multi-family housing\n* * * on the inclusion of at least 20\npercent assisted units; (b) granting\nnecessary tax abatements to housing\ndevelopments constructed under the terms of\nthe legislation referred to in clause (a);\n(c) granting density bonuses to such\ndevelopers; (d) providing for zoning changes\nto allow the placement of such developments,\nprovided, however, that such changes are not\nsubstantially inconsistent with the character\nof the area; and (e) other provisions upon\nwhich the parties may subsequently agree\n* * *,\n\n-7-\n\"as promptly as practicable but, in no event, later than 9Q days\nafter\" January 28, 1988, i.e., by April 27, 1988 (ibid.).\nSection 18 of the Decree required the parties to negotiate a\nsecond consent decree by February 15, 1988, with regard to the\nunresolved details of the Long Term Plan (ibid.).\nOn March 21, citing intense public opposition to the remedy,\nthe City moved to modify the Consent Decree (3/21/88 Deft.\nMotion to Amend). In connection with that motion, the City\nstated its willingness to refund more than $29 million in\nfederal funds that it had received since 1980, if it were\nrelieved of its obligation to provide sites for public housing in\neast Yonkers, as required by the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (see Addendum A, q 23). The court denied the\nmotion (3/31/88 Tr. 64).\nC. The Long Term Plan Order\nPursuant to the Consent Decree, the parties began\nnegotiations on the details of the Long Term Plan in February.\nDrafts of the Plan were prepared by counsel for the City.\nHowever, the City broke off negotiations in April after the\nplaintiffs would not agree to amend the Consent Decree and the\ncourt denied the City's motion for such amendment (see Addendum\nA, 11 23, 24). On May 2, 1988, the United States and the NAACP\nsubmitted to the court a proposed Long Term Plan Order, which was\nbased upon the draft that had been prepared by the City's\nlawyers, and which largely reflected the parties' agreements\nreached during negotiations (5/2/88 Joint Motion at 4-8).\n\n- 8 -\nConsistent with the outline of the Plan set forth in the  Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7-11), the plaintiffs' proposed\norder contemplated a program of incentives and City actions\ndesigned to induce private developers to develop affordable\nhousing, in combination with market rate housing, in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (5/2/88 Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenors'\nProposed Long Term Plan Order). The proposed order granted the\nCity discretion to establish the mix of Mandated Incentives which\nit would make available to each developer, and set forth examples\nof the types of Mandated Incentives which the City would\nimplement (id. at 10-12). The United States and the NAACP also\nsubmitted joint amended comments setting forth the rationale for\neach aspect of their proposed order (5/2/88 Plaintiff and\nPlaintiff-Intervenors' Joint Amended Long Term Plan Comments).\nThe City opposed the plaintiffs' proposed order. In\naddition to opposing entry of any Long Term Plan Order on the\nground that it had moved to vacate the Consent Decree (see\nAddendum A, ¶% 25-26), the City stated three specific objections\nto the plaintiffs' proposed order:\n(a) its requirement that all multi-family\nhousing be built in at least an 080/20\"\nconfiguration is excessively restrictive, and\nthe city proposes that the order contain a\nvariance procedure for permitting less than\n20% assisted units (though not less than 10%)\nin any development;\n(b) its failure to provide for any\nefficiency or one bedroom units in the\naffordable price categories is contrary to\nthe evidence that a need for such units\nexists; and\n\n-9-\n(C) no new Office of Implementation is\nappropriate or necessary, since existing City\nshould be given the\nagencies and resources \nresponsibility of implementing the plan.\n(5/16/88 City's Memorandum In Opposition to Plaintiffs' Joint\nProposed Long-Term Plan at 3). In addition, the\nMotion to Enter \nCity suggested specific changes in the provisions regarding\nresale restrictions, architectural integration, mandated\nincentives, and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (id. at 4).\nThe City stated that the \"overall thrust\" of its proposed\nchanges was \"to give greater flexibility to the City to respond\naffirmatively to development proposals which do not meet all of\nthe specific restrictions\" in the plaintiffs' proposed order\n(id. at 19). In opposing the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office, the City emphasized its preference for\nretaining responsibility for implementation of the Plan in\nexisting City agencies (id. at 13-16).\nThe district court then requested the plaintiffs to submit a\nrevised proposed order reflecting, to the extent agreeable to the\nplaintiffs, the City's comments on the plaintiffs' initial\nproposal. Plaintiffs submitted such a revised proposal on June\n2, 1988. Following argument on June 8 (6/8/88 Tr. 146-183), the\nLong Term Plan Order was entered, as further modified by the\ncourt, on June 13, 1988 (6/13/88 Long Term Plan Order).\nThe court's order included a number of modifications to the\nplaintiffs' proposed order, in response to the City's objections\nrelating to the minimum percentage of subsidized units in a\ndevelopment (id. at 2), provision for some one-bedroom units (id.\n\n- 10 -\nat 3), architectural integration (id. at 9-10), and permissible\nuses of funds from the Affordable Housing Trust  Fund (i_ at 13-\n14). The court's order also included a provision giving priority\nto developer proposals that would \"assure the provision of\nassisted housing in a dispersed manner and so to  avoid the undue\nconcentration of both public and assisted units in any\nneighborhood of Yonkers\" (id. at 4). The City's objections to\nthe order that were not accepted by the court involved the\ncreation of an Implementation Office to implement the Plan\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178-180), the use of tax abatements (id. at 177-178),\nand the reduction of the transfer restriction for housing\ndeveloped under the Plan from 30 to 20 years (id. at 178).\nThe City has appealed the entry of the June 13 Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nD. Enforcement of the Consent Decree\nand Long Term Plan Order\nAs of June 13, more than four months after entry of the\nConsent Decree, and more than one month after the deadline to\nwhich it had agreed, the City had failed to pass the legislation\nrequired by Section 17 of the Decree. On June 17, with the Long\nTerm Plan Order entered, and thus the specific content of the\nnecessary legislation established, the United States asked the\nCourt to set a timetable for the legislation's enactment (6/21/88\nJ The 30-year restriction originated in the drafts prepared by\nthe City during negotiations, and was reflected in similar plans\nof a number of New Jersey towns which had been submitted by the\nCity during negotiations (6/8/88 Tr. 155). The City\nacknowledged at argument that the dispute on this issue was \"hard\nto resolve on the merits\" (id. at 178).\n\n- 11 -\nCourt Exh. A). In a telephone conference, counsel for the City\nstated that a consulting firm had been retained to draft  the\nfor\nappropriate legislation, that a draft would be available \nreview by the plaintiffs and the OHA by July 19, and that City\nCouncil action could be anticipated at the next City Council\nmeeting -- perhaps in August (6/21/88 Tr. 3). The district\ncourt expressed its concern about continued delay and requested\nthe City Council to pass a resolution adopting the provisions of\nthe Consent Decree and the Long Term Plan Order (id. at 3-4,\n21\n20).  Counsel for the City drafted such a resolution\n\"indicating [the City Council's] commitment to the\nimplementation of\" the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree,\nand the Long Term Plan Order (Res. No. 177-1988). On June 28,\n1988, the Yonkers City Council voted, 5 to 1, to reject the\nresolution (ibid.).\nFollowing this action, the district court directed the\nplaintiffs to prepare a proposed order \"requiring Yonkers to take\nspecific implementing action pursuant to a prescribed time-table,\non penalty of a finding of contempt and the imposition of\nbankrupting fines\" (6/29/88 Order).0 On July 5, 1988,\nplaintiffs submitted such a proposed order, setting forth a\nL The court indicated that it was particularly concerned in\nlight of a resolution passed by the City Council the previous\nweek declaring a moratorium on the development of all public\nhousing in the City of Yonkers, despite the provisions of the\nHousing Remedy Order and the Consent Decree requiring the City to\nprovide sites for 200 units of such housing (6/21/88 Tr. 4, 18;\nsee Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\nJ' The City has appealed the entry of the June 29 Order.\n\n- 12 -\ntimetable for City actions and providing that failure  to take\nsuch actions would Subject the City to possible contempt\nSanctions (7/5/88 Plaintiffs' Notice of Motion and Proposed\nOrder) .\nIn its memorandum opposing entry of the proposed order, the\nCity stated that \"the City has indicated by the defeat of the\n[June 28] Resolution * * * that it will not voluntarily adopt the\nlegislation contemplated by [the Long Term Plan] Order\" (7/12/88\nCourt Exh. A at 4). The City argued that, rather than imposing\ncontempt sanctions on the City for its refusal to comply with the\ncourt's orders, the court should simply \"enter an order adopting\nthe necessary\" legislation (id. at 3).\nAt the hearing on July 12, the district court solicited the\nparties' comments on the possible creation by the court of an\nAffordable Housing Commission, which would exercise all of the\nCity Council's functions relating to the implementation of the\nhousing remedy orders (7/12/88 Tr. 6-9). In written comments,\nthe United States opposed the creation of such a commission\nbecause it would allow the City and its officials to avoid their\nobligation to comply with the lawful housing remedy orders of the\ndistrict court and allow them to continue to inflame community\nopposition to the court's orders (7/22/88 Comments of the United\nStates). The City stated that it could not support the creation\nof a commission because it was concerned about divesting its City\nCouncil of its \"core legislative as well as executive functions\"\n\n- 13 -\n(7/25/88 city's Comments at 2). The NAACP supported the concept\nof a commission (7/22/88 Brief of NAACP).\nQn July 26, at the United States' urging, the district court\nentered an Order requiring the City, on or before August 1, to\nenact the legislation implementing the Long Term Plan, as\nrequired by Section 17 of the Consent Decree and in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88 Order).\nconsultants\nSuch legislation had been drafted by the City's own \nand incorporated the terms of the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 2-6; 7/26/88 Court Exh. A). The City stated that it had no\nobjections to the proposed legislation except for those it had\npreviously expressed regarding the Long Term Plan Order (7/26/88\nTr. 6; see pp. 8-10, supra). The July 26 Order provided that the\nCity's failure to enact the legislation, and to demonstrate why\nit should not be held in contempt at a show cause hearing on\nAugust 2, would subject the City to contempt and daily fines\nuntil it enacted the legislation.V The fines to be imposed were\nset at $100 for the first day of noncompliance with the daily\nrate doubling for each consecutive day of noncompliance (7/26/88\n21 \nThe City subsequently advised the district court of state\nprocedural requirements of notice and public hearing prior to the\nenactment of zoning ordinances which purportedly would have made\nit impossible for the City to adopt the ordinance at issue by\nAugust 1. By letter dated July 28, the Court clarified its order\nand advised the parties that its July 26 order would be satisfied\nif the City Council adopted a resolution on or before August 1\ncommitting itself to enact the ordinance within the minimum time\nprescribed for notice pursuant to state law (7/28/88 Letter from\nJudge Sand to All Counsel). The City has filed a notice of\nappeal from the July 28 letter. At its August 1 meeting the\nCity Council scheduled the required hearing on the legislation\nfor August 15 (8/2/88 Tr. 2).\n\n- 14 -\na(cid:9) Order at 2-3). In addition, if the legislation were not passed,\nfailed to vote for it, and failed\nmembers of the City Council who \nto demonstrate why they should not be held in contempt at the\nAugust 2 show cause hearing, would be held in contempt, fined\n$500 per day of noncompliance, and imprisoned after ten days of\nnoncompliance (id. at 3_4).1QJ The City has appealed the July\n26 Order.\nOn August 1, by a vote of 4 to 3, the City Council defeated\nthe resolution called for by the July 26 Order, as clarified by\nthe July 28 letter (8/2/88 Tr. 2). On August 2, the Court held\nthe City in contempt and imposed fines on the schedule set out in\nthe July 26 order. The City's lawyer reiterated its argument\nthat the court should order the legislation into effect, rather\nthan holding the City in contempt for refusing to enact it  (id.\nat 3). The court found that the City had been given adequate\nnotice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard (id. at\n23). In holding the City in contempt, the court found that the\n\"extent of the resistance by the City * * * is unprecedented\"\n(id. at 22), and that \"this is but the latest of a series of\ncontempts\" (id. at 23). The City has appealed from this contempt\norder.\nThe court also heard, on August 2, from three of the four\nCouncil members who had voted against the legislation.\nCouncilmen Fagan and Longo stated that they had voted against the\nThe individual sanctions would terminate if the legislation\n.1-QJ \nwere passed or if the individuals voted for the legislation\n(7/26/88 Order at 3-4).\n\n- 15 -\nlegislation because there had been no public hearing or\nopportunity for input from the public (id. at 40-42).\nCouncilman Chema gave no explanation for his vote. His attorney\ncontended that he had not had adequate opportunity to  prepare,\nbut did not subsequently take advantage of the court's offer to\nhold an evidentiary hearing the following week (id. at 44-54, 58-\n61). The court found that all three had had adequate notice and\nfound them in contempt (id. at 42, 62). The court gave each of\nthe individuals until August 5 to request an evidentiary hearing,\nset August 8 as the date for such a hearing if requested, and\nruled that the individuals' checks would not be cashed pending\nthe outcome of such a hearing (id. at 56-60). None of the\nindividuals requested an evidentiary hearing. Fagan, Longo, and\nChema have appealed the contempt orders.\nThe proceedings with respect to Councilman Spallone were\nadjourned until August 4 to enable him to retain counsel.(cid:9) On\nthat date, the court found that Spallone had had adequate notice\nof the court's order and of the consequences of his violation of\nthat order,i J and that he had deliberately violated the order\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35). Spallone's defense was that the court lacked\nthe power to order him to vote in a particular way and that he\nwas not bound to comply with the Consent Decree because he had\n11 Spallone, like the other Council members, was given the\noption of requesting an evidentiary hearing to be held on August\n8 (8/2/88 Tr. 63).\n.221 Spallone had been in court on July 26 when the order was\nentered (8/4/88 Tr. 4).\n\n- 16 -\nnot voted for it in January (id. at 7-8, 10-13, 28-29, 31). The\ncourt heard uncontradicted evidence that Spallone had made a\nnumber of statements indicating that he would not comply with the\ncourt's orders (id. at 24-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A). The court\nfound that no factual issues were in dispute and held him in\n(8/4/88 Tr. 35-36). \ncontempt  Spallone has appealed the contempt\norder.\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt orders until argument of these appeals on the merits on\nAugust 17.\nARGUMENT\nThis Court affirmed the district court's May 28, 1986,\nHousing Remedy Order as \"plainly reasonable,\" \"necessary,\" and\n\"appropriate and prudent,\" particularly in light of \"[t]he City's\npast history of foot-dragging (e. g., nine years taken to approve\nsites for 750 units) and its refusals to approve any site for\nlow-income housing outside\" minority areas. United States v.\nYonkers Board of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1236-1237 (1987). Now,\nafter two more years in which the City has continued to delay\ncompliance and actively to defy the district court's remedy\norders -- and during which the court has given the City every\nopportunity to comply voluntarily -- the court has found the City\nin contempt and has imposed escalating fines designed to coerce\nthe City's compliance. As the district court stated (8/2/88 Tr.\n22-23):\nIt would be difficult to imagine a clearer\nchallenge to the constitution of the United\n\n- 17 -\nStates and to a government of law than that\ncourt\npresented this morning. If a federal \nto remedy racial\norder designed \ndiscrimination can be flouted by a\nbecause that is what appears to\nmunicipality \nbe the course of political expediency, then\na  form\nwe no longer live under  constitutional \nof government. Then one has to put an\nasterisk to the constitution and say,\n\"Provided, however, that if the community is\nsufficiently hostile to remedial action\ndesigned to insure and protect these rights,\nthen all bets are off.\"\nAs set forth below, the district court acted properly in\nentering the Long Term Plan Order; in imposing the contempt\nsanctions designed to coerce compliance with its orders; and in\nfinding the City and four members of the City Council in civil\ncontempt. The district court's orders should be affirmed and no\nfurther stay of the district court's contempt orders should be\ngranted.\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ENTERING THE LONG TERM PLAN ORDER\nA district court has \"substantial latitude\" in devising\nremedies for constitutional violations. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1236. On appeal, the reviewing court must \"acknowledge the\nrespect owed a District Judge's judgment that specified relief is\nessential to cure a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\"\nUnited States v. Paradise, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1073 (1987); and the\nchoice of remedies is entrusted \"'to the sound discretion of the\ntrial court.'\" Ibid., quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S.\n448, 508 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring), quoting Franks v.\n\n- 18 -\nBowman Trans. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 794 (1976) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). The district court\nhere did not abuse its discretion in entering the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\nThe City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan  for the\ndevelopment of affordable housing outside the southwest quadrant\nof Yonkers was part of the original Housing Remedy Order and, as\nsuch, has already been upheld by this Court.  Yonkers, 837 F.2d\nat 1184. The Consent Decree, to which the City agreed and is\nindisputably bound, established the framework for and resolved\nthe most controversial issues relating to the Long Term Plan.\nThe Consent Decree set a goal of 800 units of privately developed\nassisted housing, to be developed in conjunction with market rate\nhousing over a four-year period, and committed the City to enact\nlegislation to effectuate the Plan (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 7).\nThus, the City's obligation to implement a Long Term Plan, and to\nenact legislation, in accordance with the Housing Remedy Order\nand the Consent Decree, is the law of the case and is not open to\nfurther review. See Crane Co. v. American Standard, Inc., 603\nF.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir. 1979).\nThe Consent Decree left the details of the Long Term Plan to\nfurther negotiations. However, after agreement had been reached\non a basic draft, the City broke off negotiations for reasons\nunrelated to the Long Term Plan itself (see p. 7, supra). Thus,\nin order to effectuate the Consent Decree, the plaintiffs were\nforced to submit a proposed Long Term Plan Order to the court for\n\n- 19 -\nentry. The court obtained the City's comments on the proposed\norder and heard argument on the disputed issues. on June 13 it\nentered an Order that was fully consistent with both the Housing\nRemedy Order and the Consent Decree, that largely reflected\nagreements which had been reached among the parties during\ntook \nnegotiations, and that  into account most of the objections\nexpressed by the City (see pp. 7-10, supra).\nMoreover, the City's remaining objections to the Order were\nrelatively minor and somewhat ambiguous. 13 The City contended\nthat resale restrictions on housing developed under the Plan\nshould be limited to 20 years, rather than 30. However, the 30-\nyear restriction had initially been proposed by the City and was\nfound in many of the municipal plans used as models for the Long\nTerm Plan during negotiations. The City's lawyer acknowledged at\nargument that this dispute was \"hard to resolve on the merits\"\n(6/8/88 Tr. 178). The City also objected to the Order's\nprovisions regarding the use of tax abatements, claiming that\nthey were inconsistent with state law. However, the City had\nspecifically agreed to grant tax abatements in the Consent\nDecree (1/28/88 Consent Decree at 9), and the City's lawyer\nstated at argument that the question of state law \"would require\nadditional study\" and contended only that granting tax\n1J \nThe City also contended that the Long Term Plan Order should\nnot be entered because it was based on the Consent Decree, which\nthe City had moved to vacate (see p. 8, supra). The court's\ndenial of the City's motion to vacate, which has not been\nappealed, vitiates that basis for objection to the Long Term Plan\nOrder.\n\n- 20 -\nabatements in the manner contemplated by the Order would be\n\"unfair\" to other residents of Yonkers (id. at 177-178).\nFinally, the City objected to the creation of a separate\nImplementation Office to administer the Plan, and argued that\nsuch responsibility should be vested in existing City agencies\n(id. at 178-180). However, the court found that, in light of\nthe City's history of obstructing the development of assisted\nhousing, a separate Implementation Office was appropriate to\nshield the implementation of the Plan from political interference\n(id. at 179).14\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in\noverruling the City's objections to the proposed Order and in\nentering the June 13 Long Term Plan Order.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nIN ISSUING ITS JUNE 29 AND JULY 26 ORDERS\nOn June 28, 1988, in response to a direct request from the\ncourt, the City Council refused to commit itself to complying\nwith the Housing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long\n141 Neither the City nor any of the individual Council members\ncontent \ncited these objections to the  of the Long Term Plan Order\nas a reason for their refusal to enact the resolution on August\n1. See pp. 14-16, supra.\n\n- 21 -\nTerm Plan Order. 15 The City was already two months past the\ndate on which the Consent Decree required it to enact the\nimplementing legislation for the Long Term Plan. The Housing\nRemedy Order was more than two years old and, due to the City's\nobstruction and delay, no housing construction had begun.\nAgainst this background, the court issued its  June 29 Order\ndirecting the plaintiffs to submit a proposed order setting forth\na timetable for City compliance, and contempt sanctions in case\nof noncompliance. After submission of the proposed order, and\ncomments from the City, the court entered its July 26 Order.l6\nThat order required the City to enact the legislation necessary\nto implement the Long Term Plan Order, and declared that if the\nlegislation was not passed by August 1, the City and the members\nof the City Council who failed to vote for it would be required\nto show cause why they should not be held in civil contempt. A\nfinding of contempt would result in escalating fines for the\nCity, beginning at $100 per day and doubling every day, and fines\nof $500 per day for the individual Council members, who would\nalso be subject to imprisonment after 10 days of noncompliance.\n15 On the same date, the City Council adopted a resolution\ncalling for the withdrawal of the City's condemnation action for\none of the public housing sites designated by the Consent Decree\n(Addendum A, 1 28; Addendum C). One week earlier, the City\nCouncil had adopted a resolution declaring a moratorium on the\nconstruction of all public housing in the city, in defiance of\nthe public housing aspects of the Housing Remedy Order and the\nConsent Decree (Addendum A, q 27; Addendum B).\n16 The court also considered, as an alternative or supplement to\ncontempt sanctions, the creation of a commission which would take\nover all of the executive and legislative functions of the City\nCouncil relating to the housing remedy (see pp. 12-13, supra).\n\n- 22 -\nA district court is vested with \"wide discretion\" in\nfashioning remedies to coerce compliance with its orders.\nVuitton et Fils S.A. v. Carousel Handba gs, 592 F.2d 126, 130 (2d\nCir. 1979). The district court did not abuse that discretion in\nissuing the June 29 and July 26 orders here.\ndid not err in selecting\nA. The district court \ncivil contempt as the appropriate sanction\nfor the City's noncompliance\nThe court's orders contemplated the imposition of civil\ncontempt sanctions, designed to coerce compliance with its\norders. This approach is well grounded in the law:\nOnce issued, an injunction may be enforced..\nMany of the court's most effective\nenforcement weapons involve financial\npenalties. * * * Civil contempt proceedings\nmay yield a conditional jail term or fine.\n* * * If a state agency refuses to adhere to\na court order, a financial penalty may be the\nmost effective means of insuring compliance.\nHutto V.F inney, 437 U.S. 678, 690-691 (1978) (citations\nomitted).\nThe purpose of civil contempt fines is to coerce a party to\ncomply with the court's orders. Local 28. Sheet Metal Workers v.\nEEOC, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 3033 (1986); McComb v. Jacksonville Paper\nCo., 336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949); Northside Realty Assocs. v. United\nStates, 605 F.2d 1348, 1356 (5th Cir. 1979) (contempt of\ninjunction under the Fair Housing Act). A party subject to such\ncoercive sanctions holds within its hands the power to end the\nsanctions by simply ceasing its contumacious conduct.  See\nShillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 368 (1966); United\nStates v. Handler, 476 F.2d 709, 714 (2d Cir. 1973). Here the\n\n- 23 -\nfines will end as soon as the City enacts the ordinance (or a\nresolution committing itself to enact the ordinance at the\nearliest possible time) as required by the district court's\norders. The dilemma of potentially bankrupting fines facing the\nCity is thus one of its own making and one which it has full\npower to avoid.\nThe City argued below that the court should have chosen a\ndifferent remedy for its noncompliance, and should have simply\nordered the legislation into effect)r2J But a court has no\nobligation to revise its prior orders -- particularly in a manner\ninconsistent with a consent decree the parties bargained for and\nobtained -- merely because a party decides not to comply.JJ\nMoreover, the City's alternative would not have addressed the\nunderlying problem here: the City's repeated refusal to obey the\ncourt's orders. It is the City, not the court, which has chosen\nthis confrontation. It is the City which has flouted the law.\nill This argument was inconsistent with the position adopted by\nthe City regarding the Long Term Plan Order. In urging the court\nnot to require it to create a separate Implementation Office, the\nCity argued that maximum responsibility should be retained by\nthe City's existing agencies (see pp. 8-9, su pra). In addition,\nthe City opposed the creation of a commission to carry out the\nCity Council's responsibilities because it would divest it of\n\"core legislative as well as executive functions\" (7/25/88 City's\nComments at 2).\nIn any case, direct judicial exercise of the legislative\nfunction would be more, not less intrusive than directing City\nofficials to exercise their responsibilities in accordance with\nthe court's remedy orders. The path now recommended by the City\ncould only ultimately lead to continuous judicial management of\nthe City's affairs. Contempt is the classic means of achieving\ncompliance with court orders and is better tailored to that end\nthan the City's suggested remedy.\n\n- 24 -\nIt is the City that must now comply with the law. As the\ndistrict court stated (8/2/88 Tr. 8-9):\n[T]here does have to come a moment of truth,\na moment of reckoning, a moment when the City\nof Yonkers seeks not to become a national\nsymbol of defiance to civil rights and to\nheap shame upon shame upon itself, but to\nrecognize its obligation to conform to the\nlaws of the land and not step by step, order\nby order, but in the way in which any\nresponsible community concerned about the\nwelfare of its citizens functions. That is\nnot going to be accomplished by this court\nadopting the ordinance.\nUnder the district court's orders, implementation of the\nLong Term Plan Order and the necessary legislation still rests\nsubstantially with City officials, including the City Council,\nwhere it belongs. The City, at long last, must be required to\nmeet its legal obligations under the court's remedial orders.\nThe court did not abuse its discretion in determining to impose\ncivil contempt sanctions to compel such compliance.\nB. The level of fines imposed upon the City were\nan appropriate means of coercing compliance\nThe district court has struggled with the City's\nextraordinary willingness to delay and obstruct the\nimplementation of the remedy and to defy the court's orders for\nmore than two years. The district court was thus in the best\nposition to determine the most effective means of securing the\nCity's compliance. The court's judgment regarding  the size of\nfines against the City and the nature and extent of the sanctions\nagainst contemptuous City officials is entitled to considerable\ndeference from this Court. Vuitton, supra.\n\n- 25 -\nCertainly the fines set by the July 26 Order will mount to\nbankrupting levels in a short time if the City continues to defy\nthe court's orders. Yet to be effective in  coercing this City's\ncompliance, any fines must be quite severe. The City is already\non record as being willing to refund over $29 million dollars to\ncompliance with the public\nthe federal government to avoid \nhousing aspect of the remedy, and to sell bonds in order to raise\nthat sum (see p. 7, supra, and Addendum A, 1 23). Thus the City\nis willing to pay an extremely high price to avoid the\ndevelopment of assisted housing in east Yonkers. Fines which\ngrew-more slowly would only succeed in compelling compliance more\nslowly, but would surely have to reach the same high levels\nbefore the City would finally comply.\nHere, the fines start at a very low level, thus allowing the\nCity Council some days to reflect and to change its course, or\nfor other authorities to intervene, 19 before a bankruptcy\noccurs. A different fine schedule -- for example, $100,000 per\nday -- might well be insufficient to compel compliance if the\nCity Council elected to try to sell bonds, levy  taxes or\notherwise raise the money to pay for its continued defiance. The\ndistrict court's schedule of fines does not allow the City time\nfor such tactics. That the fines here will rise at an\nescalating rate means only that the time for such reflection will\nend sooner rather than later, and that the City will finally\nThe City is subject to supervision by an Emergency Financial\nControl Board, which has broad powers over its finances. See\n7/22/88 Comments of the United States at 7-12.\n\n- 26 -\ncomply with the court's orders sooner rather than later. While a\ndifferent level of fines might, at first blush, appear less\nharmful to the citizens of Yonkers, the district court's order\nbetter serves the interests of justice and of  Yonkers residents\nbecause it ensures a rapid resolution to this controversy.\nThe Supreme Court approved the use of much harsher civil\ncontempt fines in United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S.\n258, 304-305 (1947), when it upheld a coercive fine of $2.8\nmillion dollars -- in 1947 dollars -- imposed on a union. More\nrecently, the Court has held that contemptuous conduct, including\na history of \"persistent or egregious discrimination\" and\n\"'foot-dragging resistance' to court orders\" may authorize the\ngranting of extraordinary relief where other methods fail, even\nwhere innocent third-parties may suffer. Local 28, 106 S. Ct. at\n3050, 3051. Indeed, here no party need suffer at all if the City\nsimply complies with the court's orders.\nZQJ In its stay papers in this Court, the City argued that the\nfines here violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth\nAmendment (City's Reply Memorandum at 5). However, the Eighth\nAmendment applies only to criminal proceedings and thus is\nirrelevant to civil contempt sanctions. In graham v. Wright, 430\nU.S. 651, 664 (1977); see Uphaus V. Wyman, 360 U.S. 72 (1959);\nUnited States v. Dien, 598 F.2d 743, 745 (2d Cir. 1979) (Eighth\nAmendment inapplicable to coercive imprisonment imposed as civil\ncontempt sanction).\n\n- 27 -\nThe court did not err in setting the schedule of fines for\nthe City at $100 per day, doubling every day.J\nC.

The City also agreed in the Consent Decree to\nnegotiate the details of the Plan, which were then to be included\nin the implementing legislation.

As set forth above (pp. 17-20, supra), the\ncourt did not err in entering the Long Term Plan Order, which\nsupplied the content of the legislation. In order to ensure that\nits remedy orders would be implemented -- and the City's housing\nviolations at long last remedied -- the court was also authorized\nto order the City to enact the legislation.\nAs this Court has held, a court's power to \"restructure the\noperation of state and local entities\" is \"flexible but not\nunlimited.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1235.

Rather, it is its power to affect the siting of assisted\nhousing, which was one of the bases for the finding of liability,\nand therefore the proper subject of the remedial orders.\n\n- 29 -\nthe court properly\nCouncil refused to carry out this obligation, \nordered it to do so.2--/\n2.

Marino, 613\nF.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1980). As this Court has recognized, however,\nthe doctrine of legislative immunity has no application in cases\nsuch as this one where the injunction is directed toward\npreventing \"defiance of federal court desegregation orders.\" •\nat 10. Citing Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 191 F. Supp.\n871 (E.D. La.) (3-judge court), aff'd, sub nom., Dennyv. Bush,\n367 U.S. 908 (1961) (per curiam), this Court distinguished such a\ncase from the traditional application of legislative immunity in\na private Section 1983 action:\nThat case [Bush] involved an entirely\ndifferent set of circumstances from that in\n23 The alternative belatedly proposed by the City -- direct\njudicial exercise of the Council's legislative authority to adopt\nthe plan -- would have been a far greater intrusion on\nlegislative prerogative. Indeed, when the court suggested an\nindependent Commission be created that could exercise the City's\n\"core legislative\" function, the City objected (see pp. 12-13,\nsupra). Under the circumstances, it is impossible to reconcile\nthe City's positions (1) that the July 26 order unduly interferes\nwith its legislative prerogative, but that (2) judicial\nassumption of its legislative function in this area is\npermissible (and even preferable).\nThus, whatever its applicability to the City Council and\nCouncil members here, legislative immunity provides no shield for\nthe City itself.\n\n- 30 -\nthe present case. The injunction was granted\nnot pursuant to a private § 1983 civil action\nbut on a motion by the United States to\nvindicate the authority of a federal court.\nIt attacked an \"obvious\" pattern of \"delay,\nevasion, obstruction, defiance and reprisal.\"\nstar Distributors, Ltd., 613 F.2d at 10. In Bush, the 3-judge\ncourt enjoined the State Legislature of Louisiana from taking any\naction to enforce certain statutes \"and from otherwise\ninterfering in any way with the operation of the public schools.\"\nBush, 191 F. Supp. at 879. As in Bush, the district court here\nwas faced with \"an 'obvious' pattern of 'delay, evasion,\nobstruction, defiance and reprisal\" on the part of the City of\nYonkers and its City Council. Its orders requiring the City to\ncomply with the Long Term Plan Order and the Consent Decree -- in\nwhich the City had agreed to enact the legislation at issue --\nwere entirely proper. Legislative immunity cannot shield\nlegislators from sanctions for their blatant disregard for lawful\ncourt orders.\nIII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE CITY IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the City had adequate notice of the\ncourt's July 26 order, as modified by its July 28 letter. Nor is\nthere any dispute that the City failed to comply with that order.\nIndeed there can be no dispute that the City has violated the\nHousing Remedy Order, the Consent Decree, and the Long Term Plan\nOrder. The City seeks to avoid contempt by arguing for the first\ntime in this litigation that the City as a corporate entity\n\n- 31 -\nshould be distinguished from the City Council, and that the City\nC\nshould not be forced to pay for the irresponsibility of some of\nits Council members.\nSuch a dichotomy finds no support in the law or in common\nsense. The City Council acts for the City. Like all municipal\ncorporations, the City functions through its governing bodies,\nand the official actions of the governing body constitute actions\nof the City:\nIf the decision to adopt that particular\ncourse of action is properly made by that\ngovernment's authorized decisionmakers, it\nsurely represents an act of official\ngovernment \"policy\" as that term is commonly\nunderstood. More importantly, where action\nis directed by those who establish\ngovernmental policy, the municipality is\nequally responsible * * *.\nPembaur V. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481 (1986) (footnote\nomitted); see also City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 108 S. Ct.\n915 (1988). Indeed, the City's original liability in this case\nwas based in part upon the actions and inactions of the City\nCouncil and individual Council members. Yonkers, 837 F.2d at\n1188-1194, 1221-1223.\nBy adopting the Consent Decree, the City Council bound the\nCity to obey its mandates. The City cannot now avoid those\nobligations by seeking to separate itself from the only entity\nempowered to enact the legislation necessary to comply with the\nDecree. There is no authority to support the notion that a\ngovernmental entity itself cannot be held accountable if its\nofficials fail to carry out lawful court orders.\n\n- 32 -\nNor did the City's objection to entry of the Long Term Plan\nOrder justify its refusal to comply. First, the obligation to\nenact the legislation was derived from the Consent Decree, to\nwhich the City was a party. Second, as we have demonstrated (pp.\n17-20, supra), the entry of the Long Term Plan Order was entirely\nproper. Third, none of the Council members who voted against the\nresolution even mentioned the City's previously stated objections\nto the content of the Long Term Plan Order as a basis for their\nvotes. Most importantly, disagreement with a court's order does\nnot justify its violation:\n[There is] impressive authority for the\nproposition that an order issued by a court\nwith jurisdiction over the subject matter and\nperson must be obeyed by the parties until it\nis reversed by orderly and proper\nproceedings * * *. \"'* * * It is for the\ncourt of first instance to determine the\nquestion of the validity of the law, and\nuntil its decision is reversed for error by\norderly review, either by itself or by a\nhigher court, its orders based on its\ndecision are to be respected, and\ndisobedience of them is contempt of its\nlawful authority, to be punished.\"\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 293 (citations omitted). Such\nis true even where, as is emphatically not the case here, the\ninjunction would \"raise substantial * * * issues concerning * * *\nits provisions.\" Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 316\n(1967). Nor can refusal to comply with a federal court order be\ndefended by claims of the \"political difficulties\" of\ncompliance. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d 33, 37 (2d Cir.\n1986), cert. denied, 107 S. Ct. 955 (1987).\nThus the City was properly found in contempt of court.\n\n- 33 -\nIV\nTHE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN HOLDING\nTHE INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS IN CONTEMPT\nThere is no dispute that the individual Council members had\nnotice of the July 26 order (as modified by the  July 28 letter),\nthe\nthat they violated that order by failing to vote for \nresolution, or that they had adequate opportunity to  be heard\nprior to the court's contempt findings.(cid:9) Nor is there any\ndoubt that the Council members were bound by the court's orders.\nIn committing the City to the Consent Decree, the City Council\nbound itself to its terms.(cid:9) Pursuant to Rule 65(d) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, an injunction is binding upon\nthe parties to an action and their \"officers, agents, servants,\n[and] employees.\" As the Court stated in United States v. City\nof Providence, 492 F. Supp. 602, 610 (D.R.I. 1980):\n[A]lthough no City officers are specifically\nbefore the Court, the Decree is specifically\nbinding upon them, and * * * they also might\nbe brought before the Court and be required\nto adhere to the provisions of the Amended\nConsent Decree.\nSee pp. 14-16, supra. In addition, as the district court\nruled on August 2, the City Council members received adequate\nnotice of the possible need for counsel at the contempt hearing\n(8/2/88 Tr. 31-32, 44-52). Thus, any claim of inadequate time\nfor preparation by counsel for the hearing due to last minute\nretention by any Council member must be rejected. In any event,\nthe district court offered to hold an additional hearing if any\nCouncil member so requested (id. at 58-62).\n26 The fact that the January 28, 1988, judgment was entered by\nconsent does not lessen the respect due that judgment by the City\nand the City Council. Badgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d at 38.\n\n- 34 -\n%\t See also Shakman v. Democratic Ora., 533 F.2d 344, 352 (7th Cir.)\ncert. denied, 429 U.S. 858 (1976).\nWhere civil contempt is concerned, the inquiry ends here.\nThe intent of the individual Council members or their motivation\nfor disobeying the district court's mandate are irrelevant to\nthat court's finding of civil contempt. The Supreme Court held\nin McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. at 191 (citations\nand footnote omitted):\nThe absence of wilfulness does not relieve\nfrom civil contempt. Civil as distinguished\nfrom criminal contempt is a sanction to\nenforce compliance with an order of the\ncourt * * *. Since the purpose is remedial,\nit matters not with what intent the defendant\ndid the prohibited act. The decree was not\nfashioned so as to grant or withhold its\nbenefits dependent on the state of mind of\nrespondents.\nSee SEC v. American Board of Trade. Inc., 830 F.2d 431, 441 (2d\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S. Ct. 1118 (1988); Donovan v.\nSovereign Security. Ltd., 726 F.2d 55, 59 (2d Cir. 1984). In any\ncase, it cannot be disputed that the City Council members here\ndid willfully violate the court's order (see 8/2/88 Tr. 41-42,\n62; 8/4/88 Tr. 23-26; 8/2/88 Court Exh. A).\nThe district court did not err in holding the City Council\nmembers in contempt.\nV\nNO ADDITIONAL STAY OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S\nCONTEMPT ORDERS SHOULD BE GRANTED\nOn August 9, this Court granted a temporary stay of the\ncontempt order 'only until the appeals are argued on Wednesday,\n\n- 35 -\nAugust 17, 1988\" (8/9/88 Order). When that stay was issued, this\nCourt had not had the opportunity to hear the merits of these\nappeals. Now, however, the merits have been fully briefed and,\nas we have demonstrated above, the district court's orders were\nentirely justified. Because there is no substantial possibility\nthat the appellants will succeed on the merits, no further stay\nshould be granted. 27 Indeed, we urge this Court to affirm the\ndistrict court's orders forthwith.\nNeither the City nor the Council members can show that they\nwill be irreparably harmed if no further stay is granted. Each\nhas the ability to purge the contempt, and avoid any harm, by the\nsimple act of complying with the district court's orders.\nIndeed, any further delay in the enforcement of the contempt\norders would irreparably harm the public interest and the\ninterests of the plaintiffs here because it would permit the City\nand the Council members to continue to violate the district\ncourt's orders with impunity. For more than two years the City\nhas defied the court's authority. This nearly total disrespect\nfor the judicial process continues today and will continue as\nThe standards for granting a stay pending appeal are well\nestablished. A movant must show that there is a substantial\npossibility that it will prevail on the merits of its appeal,\nthat it will be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted, and\nthat granting a stay will not irreparably harm the nonmoving\nparties or the public interest. Dubose v. Pierce, 761 F.2d 913,\n920 (2d Cir. 1985), vacated on other grounds, 108 S. Ct. 2890\n(1988), citing Coleman v. Paccar. Inc., 424 U.S. 1301, 1305\n(1976) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice), and O'Brien v. Brown, 409\nU.S. 1, 3 (1972) (per curiam).\n\n- 36 -\nlong as the contempt order is stayed. As the Supreme Court has\nstated:\n[R]espect for judicial process is a small\nprice to pay for the civilizing hand of law,\nwhich alone can give abiding meaning to\nconstitutional freedom.\nWalker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. at 321. A stay of the\ncontempt order would stay \"the civilizing hand of law\" and\nirreparably harm the public interest.\nA stay also would further delay the implementation of the\nremedy and the vindication of the constitutional rights of the\ncitizens of Yonkers to equal opportunity in housing, and would\nfurther delay the enforcement of the nation's civil rights laws\nin Yonkers. In Griffin, 377 U.S. at 234, the Supreme Court\ndeclared that \"(t]he time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run\nout.\" Here, the time for the City of Yonkers to comply with the\ncourt's orders has run out. If this Court does not affirm\nbefore the stay expires, certainly it should not extend the stay.\n\n- 37 -\nCONCLUSION\n11\nFor the reasons stated above, the  district court's orders\nshould be affirmed forthwith.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

Thorne\nAttorney\n\nADDENDUM A\n\nADDENDUM A\n1. Part IV.A. of the May 28, 1986, Housing Remedy Order\nrequired the City to submit its Housing Assistance Plan  (HAP) to\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) within 15\nStates v. Yonkers Board of Educ., 635\ndays of the Order. United \nF. Supp. 1577, 1580 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). The submission of such a\nHAP was a prerequisite to the City's receipt of Community\nDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Ibid. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to submit a HAP, the plaintiff and\nplaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court approval. Ibid.\nThe City refused to submit its HAP in 1986; instead, counsel for\nthe United States prepared the HAP, which was deemed by the court\nto have been submitted by the City to HUD (6/9/86 letter,\nVanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87 Deft. Proposed Findings of\nFact & Conclusions of Law, 1 5). The City also refused to submit\nits fiscal year 1987 HAP until the court ordered it to do so\nunder penalty of contempt (7/1/87 Order).\n2. Part IV.B. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto execute a grant agreement with HUD within 15 days of the\nOrder. By executing the grant agreement, the City would formally\naccept the condition that its receipt of CDBG funds was dependent\nupon its submission of sites for public housing on the east side\nof Yonkers. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580. The Order provided\nthat if the City failed to execute the grant agreement, the\nplaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor were to do so, with court\napproval. Ibid. The City refused to execute a grant agreement\nin 1986; instead, the grant agreement was prepared by counsel for\n\n-2-\nthe United States and deemed by the court to have been executed\nby the City (6/19/86 letter, Vanderwicken to Judge Sand; 7/14/87\nDeft. Proposed Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law, 1 6).\n3. Part IV.C. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit at least two sites for 140 units of public housing on\nthe east side of Yonkers within 30 days of the Order.\t Yonkers,\n635 F. Supp. at 1580-1581. The Order provided that if the City\nfailed to do so, three unused schools sites -- School 4, School\n15, and Walt Whitman School -- would be deemed to have been\nsubmitted. The City refused to designate any public housing\nsites. School 4, 15, and Whitman thus were automatically\ndesignated (R. 229, p. 3). HUD later approved only School 4 and\nWhitman for public housing (ibid.).\n4. Part IV.D. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit sites from a list of privately owned sites for 60\nadditional units of public housing within 90 days of the Order.\nYonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1581. The City took no action except to\nwrite letters to the owners of these sites, asking them if they\nwanted to sell their properties. The City did not designate any\nof these sites or exercise its power of eminent domain to obtain\nthem (id. at 3-4).\n5. Part VI. of the Housing Remedy Order required the City\nto submit a plan for the development of additional subsidized\nhousing (the Long Term Plan) by November 15, 1986. The City\nrefused to do so (7/1/87 Order).\n\n-3-\n6. On December 5, 1986, the United States moved to have the\nCity held in contempt for its refusal to comply with the Housing\nRemedy Order. On December 9, the NAACP moved for the\nappointment of a special master to develop and implement the Long\nTerm Plan. On January 20, 1987, under threat of contempt, the\nCity Council passed a resolution agreeing to appoint an Outside\nHousing Advisor (OHA) to submit a Long Term Plan in compliance\nwith Part VI of the Housing Remedy Order and to seek additional\nsites for public housing (R. 233; 7/1/87 Order).\n7. At a hearing on April 9, 1987, the OHA gave an interim\nreport of his activities to the court and the parties. He stated\nthat he had identified as many as eighteen vacant sites in east\nYonkers which might be suitable for public housing and that the\nuse of these sites would allow for a more even distribution of\npublic housing and for less density than the existing plan to\nplace 100 units of public housing on the Whitman site and 60\nunits at School 4. Under this \"alternative plan,\" the OHA\nenvisioned approximately eight sites for public housing,\ndispersed throughout the east side of Yonkers (R. 246, pp. 1-15).\nThe court indicated its willingness to consider the adoption of\nsuch an alternative plan if specific sites were identified and\nassurances were given that the plan could be implemented\nexpeditiously (id. at 17). The court emphasized the need for\ncommunity support and its preference for allowing the City to\ndesign its own plan for complying with the Housing Remedy Order\n(id. at 30). On April 13, the court issued an order to show\n\n-4-\ncause why the Housing Remedy Order should not be amended, in\nlight of the OHA's interim report, in order to reduce the density\nof public housing on the Whitman site (4/13/87 Order).\n8. At a hearing on April 21, the City reported the\nadoption, on April 15, of City Council Resolution 19, which,\ninter alia, expressed the City Council's opposition to the\nexisting plan for public housing and advocated the adoption of\nthe alternative plan, whereby the 200 units of public housing\nwould be located on at least 6 sites in addition to Whitman and\nSchool 4, dispersed throughout all the wards in east and\nnorthwest Yonkers (4/21/87 Court Exh. C). This resolution,\nhowever, conditioned the City's support, inter alia, on the\ngranting of a stay of construction pending appeal, and the\nlimitation of additional affordable housing under the Long Term\nPlan to 200 units (ibid.).\n9. At the same hearing, the OHA testified about the six\nsites which he was recommending for public housing, stating that\nhe expected that no more than 40 to 45 units would be placed on\nany one site (id. at 11-21). The OHA explained that one site\nwas owned by New York City and its use would require action by\nthe New York City Water Board. Two of the sites were owned by\nthe Yonkers School Board, and their use would require a\nreturning \nresolution by the School Board  the property to the\ni The City's motions for a stay of the Housing Remedy Order\npending appeal had been denied by the district court (R. 207), by\nthis Court (6/13/86 Order (No. 86-6136)) and by the Supreme Court\n(107 S. Ct. 10 (1986)).\n\n-5-\nCity. The remaining sites were owned by the City of Yonkers, but\nhad been transferred to the City by Westchester County for use as\nparkland. Their use for public housing, therefore, would\nrequire action by the County (ibid.).\n10. On May 8, 1987, the City moved to modify the Housing\nRemedy Order to provide for an alternative plan for the\ndevelopment of the 200 units of public housing, to be dispersed\nthroughout the east and northwest sections of Yonkers, on sites\nto be identified by the OHA, in consultation with site selection\ncommittees. The motion and the resolution upon which it was\nbased included the following conditions, inter alia: that all\nconstruction under the Housing Remedy Order would be stayed\npending appeal to the Supreme Court, and the Long Term Housing\nPlan would be limited to no more than 200 units of affordable\nhousing (5/8/87 Deft. Notice of Motion).\n11. At a hearing on the City's motion on May 12, the court\nagain emphasized its willingness to entertain the City's\nalternative proposals for the development of public housing under\nthe Housing Remedy Order, and expressed its preference that the\nremedy should embody the views of the affected community (R. 252,\npp. 12-14). In order to ensure that the City's proposal was not\nmerely a delay tactic, the court asked the City to take the\nfollowing actions to demonstrate its willingness to act to\nactually implement the plan: 1) the adoption of appropriate\nresolutions directed to the County and New York City, asking\nthose entities to make available the sites over which they had\n\n-6-\ncontrol; 2) the adoption of a resolution indicating the City's\nwillingness to make any necessary changes in zoning, etc. which\nmight be required to make the sites available for public\nhousing; and 3) a meeting between the City and the School Board\nto discuss the availability of the school sites for public\nhousing (id. at 15-18, 39-40). The court stated that the remedy\norder would not be amended until the City had specified sites,\nand any third parties, such as the County, had acted to make them\navailable. Informed at the end of the hearing that the City had\nnot passed its second year HAP, the court directed the City to do\nso as a prerequisite to further consideration of its motion (id.\nat 42-43).\n12. Through June 1987, the City had taken no action to try\nto gain control over the sites (R. 262, pp. 3, 54).\n13. On July 1, 1987, the court entered an order finding\n(7/1/87 Order):\nThe city of Yonkers has failed to take many\nof the actions required by the Housing Remedy\nOrder. Instead, the City has delayed\nmeaningful remedial action and declined\nrepeated opportunities accorded to the City\nto act itself in the first instance in taking\nremedial action.\nThe July 1 Order, inter alia, required the City to take action to\ngain control over sites for both the public housing and the Long\nTerm Plan, under penalty of contempt and fines beginning at $100\nper day, to be doubled every day. The order specifically\nrequired the City, by July 15, 1987, to ask Westchester County to\nwaive its reverter interests in certain properties identified for\n\n-7-\nuse as potential assisted housing sites (id. at 1 10). Such\nrequest was to be submitted to the court and the parties before\nit was sent to the County (ibid.).\n14. On July 9, 1987, the City Council adopted 3\nresolutions, 2 of which were responsive to the court's July 1\nOrder, and 1 which was inconsistent with it. In Resolution 139-\n1987, the City Council adopted its FY 87 HAP, in compliance with\n¶ 14 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. A). In Resolution 140-\n1987, the City Council asked Westchester County to waive its\nreverter interest in specific sites designated by the OHA, in\ncompliance with ¶ 9 of the July 1 Order (R. 253, App. B). In\nResolution 141-1987, the City Council proposed an alternative\nplan which designated 8 specific sites for the 200 units of\npublic housing, and asked the County to waive its reverter rights\nas to 2 sites (R. 253, App. C). However, this request in\nResolution 141 was conditioned, inter alia, on the court's\ngranting of a stay pending appeal, limiting the numbers of units\non any given site, and limiting the number of units under the\nlong term plan to 200 units (100 new construction). The last\nparagraph of Resolution 141 stated that if any portion of the\nresolution was not complied with, the entire resolution would be\nnull and void (ibid.).\n15. In a conference July 9, the City's attorney represented\nthat Resolutions 139 and 140 had been adopted pursuant to the\nJuly 1 Order, and that Resolution 141 was intended as a proposed\nalternative plan (R. 263, pp. 4-5). The City's counsel stated\n\n-8-\nthat Resolution 141, with its conditions and qualifications, was\nnot intended to supersede the request to the County set forth in\nResolution 140 (id. at 14-16; see also R. 264, p. 4). The court\nstated that it would entertain the City's alternative plan if and\nwhen the City could show that it had obtained site control over\nall of the necessary sites; that it would entertain a motion for\na stay of construction pending appeal if and when it appeared\nthat construction was about to commence prior to a decision by\nthe Court of Appeals; and that any determination as to the number\nof units to be developed under the Long Term Plan, or as to any\nmix of public and market rate housing was premature (id. at 32-\n33; R. 253).\n16. On July 10, 1987, without notice to the court or the\nparties, the City wrote to Westchester County, asking it to\nwaive its reverter interest in the two sites identified in\nResolution 141, and enclosing a copy of Resolution 141 (R. 264,\npp. 2-3, 6-7). The court found that this letter had the effect\nof sending a message to the County that the City wanted the\nCounty to accept its alternative plan (with conditions) and to\nreject the request that the court had ordered it to make (id. at\n11-14). The court ordered the parties to draft a new letter to\nthe County retracting the July 10 letter from the City (id. at\n14-15) .\n17. On November 19, 1987, the County Board voted to refuse\nthe City's request that it release its reverter rights in the\nsites identified by the OHA.\n\n-9-\n18. On November 19, 1987, the court issued an order\nimposing a freeze on discretionary City actions \"in furtherance\nor implementation of\" four private development projects\nidentified by the OHA as having potential use toward\nimplementation of the Housing Remedy Order (R. 278). The freeze\nwas to be lifted if either of two events occurred: 1) if the\ncourt concluded that a given project could be of no utility in\nfurthering the housing remedy; or 2) if the City designated sites\nfor the 200 units of public housing (ibid.). In the November 19\norder, the court found (Order at 1-2):\nThe progress to date in identifying available\nsites has been extremely disheartening and\nthe attitude of the representatives of\nYonkers has been to do nothing affirmative,\nto place the entire onus of implementation\non the Court, and to engage in obstructive\nand dilatory tactics. To date, there have\nbeen untoward delays in implementing the\nHousing Remedy Order some 18 months after its\npromulgation. Only the threat of bankrupting\nfines has produced any action by the City.\n19. On December 15, 1987, the district court entered an\norder scheduling a status conference for January 11, 1988, and\nrequesting the attendance at that conference of the Mayor and\nmembers of the City Council of Yonkers. The Order stated that at\nthe conference, \"the Court will call upon the representatives of\nYonkers to advise what affirmative actions, if any, Yonkers is\ntaking or planning to take to implement the Housing Remedy\nOrder\" (12/15/87 Order).\n20. On December 28, 1987, this Court unanimously affirmed\nthe district court's liability and remedial determinations \"in\n\n- 10 -\nall respects.\" Yonkers, 837 F.2d 1181, 1184. Following this\ndecision, the parties engaged in extensive negotiations aimed at\nresolution of the housing issues in the case.) These\nnegotiations resulted in agreement, on January 25, 1988, on the\nterms of a settlement. On that date, the district court\nannounced that, had such a settlement not been reached, it would\nhave entered an order requiring certain actions by the City of\nYonkers with regard to its obligations under the Housing Remedy\nOrder. The court also vacated its November 19, 1987 freeze\norder (1/25/88 Tr. 20, 23). On January 27, 1988, the City\nCouncil adopted the Consent Decree, which was entered by the\ndistrict court on January 28 (1/28/88 Tr. 2).\n22. Following entry of the Consent Decree, intense\ncommunity opposition to the housing remedy continued (3/21/88\nDeft. Motion to Amend). Some of this opposition centered on\nclaims that too many of the 200 public housing units were to be\nsited in southeast Yonkers (3/31/88 Tr. 54). In addition, it\nwas discovered that one of the public housing sites slated for 22\nunits could accommodate only 12 units. Consequently, the parties\nand the court discussed the possibility of designating an\nadditional public housing site (id. at 57-62).\n23. On March 21, 1988, the City moved the court to amend\nthe Consent Decree to delete that portion of the Decree in which\nit agreed not to petition for certiorari on the public housing\n21 \nBecause of these negotiations, the hearing scheduled for\nJanuary 11 was not held.\n\n- 11 -\nOrder. In support of this\naspect of the court's Housing Remedy \nmotion, the City cited the intense citizen opposition to the\nConsent Decree and, particularly, to the agreement not to pursue\nan appeal of the public housing remedy. Accompanying the City's\nmotion was a proposed order that provided for the entry of a\nof the United States\njudgment against the City in favor \ngovernment not to exceed $29.86 million should the Supreme Court\nultimately relieve the City of its obligation to provide sites\nfor the construction of 200 units of public housing. This amount\nrepresented the aggregate amount of CDBG funds received by the\nCity of Yonkers for fiscal years 1980-1987.1' The City's\nproposed order also provided, in case the City decided to stop\nany public housing construction that might have begun at the time\nof such Supreme Court action, for payment to the builder of one-\nand one-half times the profit it would have realized from\ncompletion of the development (3/21/88 Deft. Motion to Amend).\nThe district court denied the City's motion on March 31, 1988\n(3/31/88 Tr. 64), and the City has not appealed from that\nruling .\n24. At an April 12, 1988, meeting in chambers with the\ndistrict court and the parties, counsel for the City of Yonkers\ninformed the court and plaintiffs that the City of Yonkers was\n1' The City had previously obligated itself to provide sites for\nsuch housing in east Yonkers as a condition to the receipt of\nCDBG funds from the HUD. Yonkers, 635 F. Supp. at 1580.\nA/ The court found that the City's motion Npander[ed] * * * to\nthose who were violently opposed to any and all public housing\"\n(3/31/88 Tr. 65).\n\n- 12 -\n\"not interested\" in completing negotiations on the terms of a\nlong term plan as required by Section 18 of the Consent Decree\n(5/2/88 Joint Motion of the United States and NAACP at 6). The\nApril 12 meeting, held to discuss implementation of the public\nhousing portion of the Consent Decree, took place after the court\nand the parties were \"advised by representatives of the City of\nYonkers that under no circumstances would the City Council\ndesignate an alternate site in Yonkers to substitute for any site\nin southeast Yonkers * * * despite the availability of an\nentirely acceptable site already approved by the parties and\ntentatively approved by HUD, in Northwest Yonkers, vacant and\nalready available\" (4/19/88 Tr. 3).\n25. On May 2, 1988, the City moved to vacate the Consent\nDecree, on the ground of alleged mutual mistake, claiming that\nthe parties' agreement had been contingent on the approval of the\nDecree by Cardinal O'Connor, which had since been withdrawn\n(5/2/88 Deft. Motion to Vacate).\n26. On May 19, 1988, at a hearing on the City's motion to\nvacate, the court offered the City time to confer with Cardinal\nO'Connor to determine whether another site could be designated in\nplace of a site owned by the Archdiocese, or to authorize the\ncourt to select an alternative site (5/19/88 Tr. 12-17). On May\n27, the City informed the district court that the City Council\nwould not submit an alternative site. The court denied the\nCity's motion to vacate the Consent Decree on June 8, finding\nthat, in light of the City's refusal to designate another site,\n\n- 13 -\nthe motion to vacate was \"a transparent ploy either to regain the\nright to appeal, and even more symbolically to avoid any\nresponsibility for the court decree or implementation of the\nhousing remedy order\" (6/8/88 Tr. 146).\n27. On June 14, 1988, the day after the Supreme Court\ndenied the City's petition for certiorari of this Court's\naffirmance of the district court's liability and remedy orders,\nthe City Council adopted Resolution 144-1988, imposing a\nmoratorium on all public housing construction in Yonkers\n(Addendum B).\n28. On June 28, 1988, the City Council adopted Resolution\n165-1988, calling for the termination of the City's condemnation\naction, taken pursuant to the Consent Decree, of that portion of\nthe St. Joseph's Seminary site designated for public housing\n(Addendum C). The preamble of this resolution stated, in part\n(ibid.):\nWHEREAS, the present Supreme Court\ndirected by a Judge who is acting as a\nphilosopher king in that he is illegally\nsocially engineering
