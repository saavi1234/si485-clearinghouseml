    "summary": "<p>This landmark case is about racial segregation in the Detroit metropolitan area schools, and has been described as the most significant school desegregation case since <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5479\">(also in this Clearinghouse)</a>. The first Supreme Court ruling is often denoted as <i>Milliken I</i>, and was considered crucial for clarifying the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation. It confirmed that a school district would not be held responsible for segregation across district lines unless it could be shown that the district had engaged in a policy of deliberate segregation.</p><p>This summary focuses on the history of the case in the Detroit community, rather than the Supreme Court jurisprudence. We only have the docket starting in 1989, so this summary is based on opinions and <i>The Detroit School Busing Case</i> by Joyce Baugh (University of Kansas Press, 1st ed. 2011).</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>On Apr. 7, 1970, to counter racial segregation in Detroit’s schools, the Detroit school board voted 4-2 to adopt a controversial integration and decentralization plan, which became known as the “April 7 plan.” The next day, the state legislature passed Act 48 in response, which repealed the April 7 plan, required there to be neighborhood schools, and reorganized the Detroit school system into eight regions along racial lines. All four of the school board members who had voted for the April 7 plan were recalled from the board in an election on Aug. 4, 1970. </p><p>On Aug. 18, 1970, NAACP attorneys filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Detroit Board of Education and other state defendants. The suit was filed on behalf of specific students (one of whom was Ronald Bradley) and these students' parents. The Detroit branch of the NAACP was also listed as a plaintiff. Later, the district court would define the class as \"all school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age.” 418 U.S. 717 (1974). </p><p>The plaintiffs’ original plan before the school board recall vote had been to challenge Section 12 of Act 48, the specific provision that struck down the April 7 plan. However, the recall necessitated a change in strategy, because all the school board members that had supported the plan were recalled and no pro-integration candidates were elected to replace them, so even if a challenge were successful, there would be no one on the board to support integration. Thus, the NAACP decided to challenge school segregation citywide, not just in the areas covered by the April 7 plan.</p><p><b>Early Days of the Lawsuit</b></p><p>The complaint, filed on 08/18/1970, alleged that racially discriminatory policies and practices had created segregation in Detroit’s public schools and challenged the repeal of the April 7 plan along with the provisions requiring segregated student assignments and racially identifiable regions. It also requested an injunction to (1) require implementation of the April 7 plan, (2) temporarily stop all school construction, and (3) halt implementation of Act 48.</p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Stephen Roth. Judge Roth denied the plaintiffs’ request for immediate implementation of the April 7 plan and suspension of all school construction; he scheduled a hearing to begin on Aug. 27, 1970. On Sept. 3, 1970, Judge Roth denied another motion by the plaintiffs to implement the April 7 plan, dismissed the governor and attorney general as defendants, and scheduled the trial to begin on Nov. 12, 1970. Joyce Baugh, <i>The Detroit School Busing Case</i> 88 (1st ed. 2011).</p><p>The plaintiffs then filed an emergency petition to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which was heard by Chief Judge Harry Phillips. Judge Phillips expedited the appeals procedure, and oral argument before a three-judge panel took place on Oct. 2, 1970, and the panel issued its decision on Oct. 13, 1970, finding that Act 48 violated the Fourteenth Amendment. It also reinstated the governor and attorney general as defendants and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings, but did not overturn the denial of the preliminary injunction that would have required the implementation of the April 7 plan.</p><p>Back in district court on remand, the plaintiffs again requested implementation of the April 7 plan, this time to start at the beginning of the second semester. They also requested a delay of the trial date. Judge Roth scheduled a hearing for Nov. 4, 1970, postponed the trial by a month, and permitted the Detroit Federation of Teachers (DFT) to intervene as an additional defendant.</p><p>Two days after the hearing, Judge Roth ordered the school board to submit an integration plan to be implemented at the beginning of the second semester, by Nov. 16, 1970—either the April 7 plan or an alternative that would achieve “no less pupil integration.” <i>Id.</i> at 89.</p><p>Judge Roth then permitted another group of defendants to intervene—a group of white parents in Detroit, who wanted to defend the school system against allegations of segregation. Many of these parents in this group were associated with the Concerned Citizens for Better Education (CCBE), the group behind the petition for the school board recall election.</p><p>On Nov. 9, 1970, the school board submitted three options: (1) the April 7 plan, (2) a plan to create magnet schools at the junior and senior high levels that black and white students could choose to attend, to be implemented in Sept. 1971, at the start of the next school year, and (3) a part-time desegregation plan, in which high school students would take some classes at a second school, so black and white students would be in classes together for part of the day. </p><p>On Dec. 3, 1970, Judge Roth issued a decision ordering the board to implement the magnet school plan the following school year. He also postponed the trial indefinitely, expressing doubt that the plaintiffs could prove their case of unconstitutional, systemwide school segregation. </p><p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Sixth Circuit. On Feb. 22, 1971, a three-judge panel refused to reconsider the plaintiffs’ request to implement the April 7 plan and upheld the district court’s acceptance of the magnet school plan. However, the panel rejected the indefinite postponement of the trial, and Judge Roth scheduled trial to begin on April 6, 1971.</p><p><b>The Trial</b></p><p>The trial lasted for 41 days. The plaintiffs had a two-part strategy, focusing (1) on housing discrimination and its effect on school segregation, and (2) on the defendants’ actions and decisions which, the plaintiffs alleged, intentionally created and perpetuated the segregated system.  </p><p>As the housing phase of the case concluded, on April 20, 1971, the Supreme Court decided <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11114\"><i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</i>, 402 U.S. 1 (1971)</a>, unanimously holding that busing was an appropriate remedy to integrate a city and surrounding suburban schools, which were all in the same district.</p><p>In the second phase of their case, the plaintiffs presented evidence that the Detroit school board’s policies created and maintained segregated schools. The plaintiffs characterized the constitutional violation as the containment of blacks in a set of separate, de jure black schools, that gradually expanded over a twenty-year period, but always within a state-created racial line of containment.</p><p>On Sept. 27, 1971, Judge Roth issued his first ruling, finding that the Detroit schools were illegally segregated because of both housing segregation and de jure segregation by the local and state defendants. The court found that the school board had made decisions to create and maintain segregation in the schools through optional attendance zones; transportation policies for relieving overcrowding in schools; the alteration of attendance zones, grade structures, and feeder patterns; and new school construction location decisions. The opinion noted that the school board had admitted to busing black students past closer white schools with available space to farther-away black schools, despite the board’s stated policy of using transportation to increase integration. Judge Roth also found that the state defendants had acted to control and maintain the segregation pattern in Detroit schools, based on (1) funding decisions that had favored white suburban districts, (2) state approval of school construction that furthered racial segregation, and (3) passage of Act 48.</p><p>A few days before the trial ended, the CCBE moved to add the other 85 school districts, which were suburban and largely white, in the tri-county area (Wayne, Macomb, and Oakland counties) as defendants. The plaintiffs and all of the other defendants were opposed to this, and Judge Roth decided to wait to rule on the motion until after the parties had submitted their desegregation plans.</p><p>The state and local defendants appealed to the Sixth Circuit, before the district court had ordered a specific remedy.</p><p><b>Finding a Remedy</b></p><p>On Oct. 4, 1971, Judge Roth held a meeting with both parties to determine how to proceed and expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of a Detroit-only remedy. He ordered the Detroit school board to submit a progress report on the magnet school plan within 30 days and a desegregation plan within 60 days, and the state defendants were given 120 days to submit a metropolitan-wide plan for desegregation. </p><p>A few days later, Michigan’s Republican junior senator Robert Griffin introduced an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prohibit busing as a remedy for school desegregation. Philip Hart, Michigan’s Democratic senior senator, led a successful filibuster against the amendment.</p><p>In Nov. 1971, the Detroit school board submitted its evaluation of the magnet plan. The report acknowledged that the non-magnet schools remained heavily segregated, and that the plan “accelerated the movement of white students out of majority black schools.” The authors concluded that to be more effective, the magnet plan would “have to cross district boundaries.”</p><p>In Feb. 1972, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the state and local defendants’ appeals of the district court ruling, holding that since no remedy had been granted or denied, there was nothing to review. </p><p>On Mar. 15, 1972, Judge Roth accepted petitions to intervene from a white citizens’ group, the CCBE, and suburban school districts, on the condition that the intervenors would not focus on issues already decided. William Saxton represented forty of the suburban school districts, and only a few of the other suburban districts chose to retain separate counsel.</p><p>Hearings on the Detroit-only plans were held Mar. 14-21, 1972. On Mar. 24, 1972, before ruling on the plans, Judge Roth issued a ruling declaring that it would be appropriate to consider metropolitan plans if it were deemed necessary to remedy the constitutional violation, citing <i>Green v. County School Board of New Kent County</i>, 391 U.S. 430 (1968) and <i>Brown II</i>, 349 U.S. 294 (1955).</p><p>On Mar. 28, 1972, Judge Roth rejected the Detroit-only desegregation plans, and criticized both the proposals submitted by the Detroit school board (the voluntary transfer and part-time desegregation programs) and by the NAACP plaintiffs (redrawing attendance boundaries, with some pairing and clustering of schools).</p><p>The Detroit school board continued to deny any acts of segregation, but argued that if desegregation were going to take place, a metropolitan plan was preferable to a Detroit-only remedy. At this point, 70% of the Detroit school district’s student population was black, and the school board argued that white flight from Detroit schools would only increase in response to a Detroit-only remedy, creating an all-black district surrounded by all-white suburban districts. Judge Roth agreed.</p><p>Between Mar. 28 and Apr. 14, 1972, another set of hearings was held on the various metropolitan plans that were submitted by the NAACP plaintiffs, the state defendants, the Detroit school board, and the CCBE. The state board submitted six proposals, all of which the Judge rejected as ineffective. The Detroit school board’s plan was to include reassignment of students at all grade levels in 69 of the 86 districts in the tri-county area, while the CCBE recommended a 62-district plan, with desegregation to begin after fourth grade. The NAACP plaintiffs suggested a plan that was similar but covered 54 districts. Saxton argued that under <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11114\"><i>Swann</i></a>), “the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,” and thus the desegregation should be limited to Detroit, where the segregation was found. The plaintiffs then introduced additional evidence demonstrating that the pattern of one-race school construction and faculty assignments extended throughout the metropolitan area. </p><p>Meanwhile, President Nixon instructed his attorney general to intervene in the Detroit case to oppose any metropolitan busing plan. Judge Roth denied the local U.S. Attorney’s request to intervene, but invited him to participate as an amicus curiae.</p><p>On June 14, 1972, Judge Roth ruled that the intra-district plans were inadequate. He reasoned that the court “must look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem,” designated 53 of the 85 suburban school districts plus Detroit as the “desegregation area,” and appointed and charged a special panel to prepare a specific student assignment and transportation plan within 45 days. </p><p>The Detroit school board, state defendants, and suburban district-defendants all appealed the ruling to the Sixth Circuit.</p><p>On July 5, 1972, the special panel reported that additional buses would be required to implement the plan. The district court added the state treasurer as a defendant and, on July 11, 1972, ordered that funds be issued to purchase the requested buses. Two weeks later, the Sixth Circuit granted the state defendants’ motion to stay the order. On July 20, 1972, the district court certified the major issues for appeal to the Sixth Circuit.</p><p>On Aug. 24, 1972, a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit heard oral argument. On Dec. 8, 1972, the panel unanimously affirmed the district court’s findings of de jure segregation of Detroit public schools by the Detroit school board and the state of Michigan and the inadequacy of a Detroit-only remedy. The panel vacated portions of the ruling, including the designation of the geographic “desegregation area,” and the remedy was put on hold to allow the state legislature to voluntarily craft a remedy.</p><p>The defendants sought en banc review, which was granted. On Feb. 8, 1973, all nine of the Sixth Circuit judges heard oral argument. On June 12, 1973, the Sixth Circuit voted 6-3 to affirm Judge Roth’s ruling on the issue for segregation and the need for a metropolitan remedy. In the majority opinion, Chief Judge Harry Phillips concluded that the record “amply” supported the district’s findings of “unconstitutional actions by public officials at both the local and State level.” 484 F.2d 215, 242 (6th Cir. 1973). However, the opinion noted that their affirmance did not rely on the evidence about segregated housing with the exception of how school construction programs helped to cause or maintain such segregation. The opinion explained that this case was different from the “classical” school segregation case in that failing to adopt a metropolitan-wide plan “would result in an all black school system immediately surrounded by practically all white suburban school systems.” 484 F.2d 215, 245 (6th Cir. 1973). Finally, the opinion expressed concern that to hold that school district boundaries could not be crossed “would be opening a way to nullify <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5479\"><i>Brown</i></a>”. 484 F.2d 215, 249 (6th Cir. 1973).</p><p>The panel agreed that a metropolitan plan was both necessary and within the power of the federal courts, vacated the remedy portion of the district court’s ruling, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings so that the suburban districts affected by the orders could be heard. The panel also vacated the July 11, 1972 order directing the purchase of school buses.  </p><p>On Sept. 6, 1973, the state defendants and suburban districts filed writs of certiorari, requesting Supreme Court review of the case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari. At that point, two other cases, <i>Allen Park Public Schools v. Bradley</i> (filed by Saxton on behalf of 40 districts), and <i>Grosse Pointe Public School System v. Bradley</i> (filed by a single district), had been consolidated with the original suit.</p><p><b>The Supreme Court - <i>Milliken I</i></b></p><p>On July 25, 1974, in a 5-4 opinion written by Chief Justice Burger, the Supreme Court upheld the finding of de jure segregation of the Detroit school district but rejected an interdistrict remedy. The opinion held that with “no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any interdistrict violation or effect,” the metropolitan remedy was “wholly impermissible” and not justified by <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5479\"><i>Brown</i></a>. 418 U.S. 717, 745 (1974). The case was remanded to the district court to develop a Detroit-only remedy.</p><p>Judge Roth died on July 11, 1974, and the case was reassigned to Judge Robert DeMascio. Judge DeMascio ordered that the plaintiffs and the Detroit school board submit each submit desegregation plans by Apr. 1, 1975. The plaintiffs’ proposal covered almost all of Detroit’s 290 schools, and aimed for the schools to more closely mirror the district’s racial composition: a range from 41% to 90% black students. The board’s plan focused on the city’s 84 majority-white schools and only some of the majority-black schools, and involved attendance zone changes, new feeder patterns, noncontiguous zoning, pairing and clustering schools, and revised grade structures.</p><p><b>The Remedy - A Detroit-Only Busing Plan</b></p><p>Judge DeMascio tried, unsuccessfully, to get the parties to agree to a single plan. In a written opinion dated Aug. 15, he issued a partial judgment, rejecting the NAACP’s proposal and ordering the school board to revise its plan. The ruling provided for a very limited Detroit-only busing plan. It excluded three regions from the central city area and involved only 27,524 of the district’s 247,774 students, which meant that 80% of the city’s black students were excluded from the plan. The judgment also ordered that several educational components be implemented in all of Detroit’s schools as ancillary relief: (1) a remedial reading program, (2) in-service training for faculty and staff, (3) vocational education, (4) a testing program, (5) a new code of student conduct, (6) a school community relations program, (7) a counseling and career guidance program, (8) co-curricular activities, and (9) bilingual and multicultural studies. The busing plan was successfully implemented in Jan. 1976, though the plaintiffs, state, and school board continued to disagree about various aspects of the district court’s orders.</p><p>In May 1976, Judge DeMascio ordered the state to pay for half of the cost of four of the educational components: the remedial reading program, in-service training, testing, and the counseling and career guidance program. The school board was to pay for the other half of the costs through its regular budget and federal grants. The state argued that there was no constitutional violation justifying these costs, and that it should not have to pay for any of them, while the school board argued that all of the components were necessary to remedy segregation, and that the state should pay 75% of the costs. </p><p>The case returned to the Sixth Circuit. A three-judge panel heard arguments on June 15, 1976. The Sixth Circuit issued a decision on Aug. 4, 1976, affirming the district court order and finding that the challenged programs were “essential to the effort to combat the effects of segregation” and that requiring the state to pay half of the costs was within the district court’s power. 540 F.2d 229, 241, 244 (6th Cir. 1976). The panel also affirmed the district court’s student assignment plan, except for its exclusion of schools in the three central city regions: “We cannot hold that where unconstitutional segregation has been found, a plan can be permitted to stand which fails to deal with the three regions where the majority of the most identifiably black schools are located.” 540 F.2d 229, 239 (6th Cir. 1976). The panel noted that it could not provide any guidelines to the district court to resolve this issue on remand, however, because it believed that “genuine constitutional desegregation cannot be accomplished within the school district boundaries.” 540 F.2d 229, 239 (6th Cir. 1976).</p><p><b>The Supreme Court - <i>Milliken II</i></b></p><p>The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in Nov. 1976 and heard oral arguments on Mar. 22, 1977. It issued its decision (<i>Milliken II</i>) on June 27, 1977. The Court unanimously affirmed the Sixth Circuit, noting that the district court’s remedial plan which extended beyond “mere pupil assignments” was “expressly approved” by <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11114\"><i>Swann</i></a> and <i>United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education</i>, 395 U.S. 225 (1969). 433 U.S. 267, 286 (1977). The court also held that  the state could bear some of the costs of the remedial programs without violating Michigan's immunity from suit established by the Eleventh Amendment.</p><p><b>District Judge DeMascio's Recusal</b></p><p>Meanwhile, at the district court level, in 1976, the plaintiffs moved for Judge DeMascio to recuse himself from the case, claiming a lack of impartiality and that they had been improperly excluded from meetings the judge had held with the school board and DFT. In Jan. 1977, Judge DeMascio denied the motion and this decision was upheld by another district judge; but, in 1978, the Sixth Circuit suggested that Judge DeMascio recuse himself, which he did on Aug. 8, 1980. 495 F. Supp. 217 (E.D. Mich. 1980). He was replaced by a panel of three district judges: Chief Judge John Feikens, and Judges Avern Cohn and Patricia Boyle. </p><p><b>The 1980s</b></p><p>Over the next several years, the plaintiffs, school board, and state continued to dispute the programs’ costs. In 1984, the panel disbanded the Monitoring Commission, which had been created to oversee the plan, and ended its oversight of the educational components. </p><p>However, the Sixth Circuit ordered that the panel reinstate the Monitoring Commission and two of the educational components, the school community relations program and the student code of conduct. In 1985, Judge Cohn assumed sole responsibility for the case. He continued his supervisory role until Sept. 1988, when he terminated jurisdiction over the educational components. </p><p>On Jan. 11, 1989, Judge Cohn declared that Detroit schools had achieved unitary status and vacated all existing orders and injunctions except for a vocational education order. </p><p>On Feb. 24, 1989, nineteen years after the suit was filed, Judge Cohn held that court supervision and jurisdiction over the desegregation plan had terminated, though litigation about attorneys’ fees continued through Jan. 1995.</p><p><b>Available Opinions</b></p><p><i>Bradley v.

Use FI CTA6 Rule 28 and FI CTA6 IOP 206 for rules regarding the citation of unpublished opinions.) \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. \nRonald BRADLEY, Plaintiff, \nThomas I. Atkins, Jeanne Mirer, and Michael Barnhart, Petitioners-Appellants, \nv. \nWilliam G. MILLIKEN, et al., Board of Education of the School Distirct of the City of Detroit, Defendants-\nAppellees. \nNo. 89-1986. \n| \nNov. 14, 1990. \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, 70-35257, Cohn, J. \nSynopsis \nE.D.Mich. \n  \nAFFIRMED. \n  \nBefore MERRITT, Chief Circuit Judge, and RYAN and ALAN E. NORRIS, Circuit Judges. \nOpinion \nRYAN, Circuit Judge. \n \n*1 This case presents the question whether attorneys may seek and obtain an award of attorney fees, under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, \nin their own name and in their own behalf. We hold that they may not and that such fees are awardable only to a prevailing \nparty. Therefore, we shall affirm the district court’s decision to deny plaintiffs’ application for attorneys’ fees. \n  \n \nI. \nThis issue we address arises from more than twenty years of litigation over the State of Michigan’s and the City of Detroit’s \npolicies regarding the racial composition of the Detroit school system. Plaintiffs, a class composed of Detroit school children \nand their parents, represented by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), alleged that \nstate and local officials had intentionally maintained segregated public schools in Detroit. Plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in \ntheir claim of intentional discrimination, see 345 F.Supp. 914 (E.D.Mich 1972), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 484 F.2d 215 \n(6th Cir.1973) (en banc), aff’d in part, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), and succeeded in setting up a desegregation plan. See 540 F.2d \n229 (6th Cir.1976) (en banc ), aff’d, 433 U.S. 267 (1977). \n  \nThe dispute involves a claim for attorney fees sought under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 brought by three attorneys who participated in \nvarious stages of the litigation. Thomas Atkins, who began working on the case in 1975, filed an application for an award of \n$157,465.20 for services rendered and $8,880.02 for costs incurred between 1984 and 1987. Jeanne Mirer and Michael \n.  1 \n \n\n \nBarnhart, who worked on the case beginning in 1984, filed applications for fees awards of $26,775 and $7,262.50, \nrespectively. Ms. Mirer also sought costs of $1,433.59 for the period of 1984 through 1989. Mr. Atkins’ service was \nperformed in his capacity as counsel for the NAACP, a position he no longer holds. Ms. Mirer and Mr. Barnhart were local \ncounsel assisting Mr. Adkins. The three plaintiffs are not presently counsel of record for the prevailing plaintiffs. The petition \nfor fees and costs was brought in the name of the plaintiff attorneys and not in the name of the prevailing parties. \n  \nThe district court conducted a hearing on the petitions and rejected the attorneys’ applications because the applicants were \nattorneys, not parties to the suit, and because the attorneys had not shown that they sought the fees and costs on behalf of any \nprevailing party as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The court’s order dismissing the action stated that the applications were \ndenied “without prejudice.” Moreover, the order provided that the petition for fees and costs must be filed in the name of the \nNAACP and the NAACP Special Contribution Fund by their current general counsel who represents the plaintiff class. \n  \n \nII. \nA. Jurisdiction \nAs a threshold matter, we must decide whether the district court’s order is appealable. This court’s jurisdiction is limited to \nappeals from final decisions of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. § 1291. A final order is one which disposes of all issues and \nleaves no questions to decide. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 373 (1981). \n  \n*2 Defendants argue that the district court’s decision denying the attorneys’ fees and costs is not appealable since it was \nentered “without prejudice.” However, the statement “without prejudice” is mere surplussage and merely leaves open the \npossibility of the NAACP seeking attorneys’ fees. The denial of fees and costs is final as to the plaintiffs in this action. \nTherefore, we hold that the district court’s decision is a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1291. \n  \n \nB. Denial of Attorneys’ Fees \nSection 1988 provides that “[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [certain civil rights actions] the court, in \nits discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” \nThe United States Supreme Court has held that “Section 1988 makes the prevailing party eligible for a discretionary award of \nattorney’s fees.” Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 110 S.Ct. 1679, 109 L.Ed.2d 74, 82 (1990)(citing Evans v. Jeff D., 475 \nU.S. 717, 730 (1986) (emphasis in original)). In holding that statutory fees awards may coexist with private fee arrangements, \nthe Supreme Court noted that “it is the party, rather than the lawyer,” who is eligible for fees under section 1988. Id. at 82-83. \n  \nMoreover, the Supreme Court noted in Evans that “the language of the Act, as well as its legislative history, indicates that \nCongress bestowed on the ‘prevailing party’ (generally plaintiffs) a statutory eligibility for a discretionary award of \nattorney’s fees in specified civil rights actions.” 475 U.S. at 730 (emphasis in original). In holding that a settlement of a civil \nrights case may be conditioned on a waiver of attorney’s fees, the Court specifically stated that section 1988 did not bestow \nfee awards upon attorneys. Id. at 731. \n  \nFollowing Venegas and Evans, we hold that it is the prevailing party and not his attorney who is entitled to fees and costs \nunder section 1988. Thus, Messrs. Atkins and Barnhart, and Ms. Mirer are not the proper parties to seek attorney’s fees under \nsection 1988. Having so concluded, we need not address the subsidiary issue whether these attorneys represent prevailing \nparties. \n  \n \n.  2 \n \n\n \nIII. \nThe district court’s decision denying plaintiffs’ applications for attorneys’ fees is AFFIRMED. \n  \nAll Citations \n918 F.2d 178 (Table), 1990 WL 177183 \n \n \n \n \n.  3 \n ",

On August 21, 1978, the defendant Detroit Board of \nEducation submitted to the court a proposed pupil reassignment plan as they were directed to do by \nthis court's August 7, 1978 order. After having examined the Detroit Board's proposed pupil \nreassignment plan, we found that it was not entirely clear in all respects and directed the Detroit \nBoard to submit color keyed maps to clearly indicate which schools in Regions 1 and 2 were \nincluded in the plan and further to clearly reflect the number of Spanish surnamed students included \nin the plan. The Detroit Board submitted the color coded maps on September 1, 1978. On October \n25, 1978, the Detroit Board submitted a revised proposed pupil reassignment plan that made minor \nchanges in the transportation pattern between Regions 1 and 2. \n326*326 No party, including the plaintiffs, has submitted a brief critiquing the Detroit Board's \nproposed reassignment plan, although paragraph 5 of our August 7, 1978 order stated that \"each \nparty may have ten days [after submission of the Detroit Board's plan] to forward to the court briefs \ncritiquing the Detroit Board's plan.\" Since no party has objected, the court has reviewed the \nproposed plan, and we approve the plan as one that substantially conforms to the guidelines set \nforth in our August 7, 1978 order. Accordingly, a partial amendment to our May 11, 1976 Judgment \nwill be entered. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n ",

Runkel, William Waterman, Pontiac, Mich., for LULAC. \nBefore MERRITT and CONTIE, Circuit Judges, and EDWARDS, Senior Circuit Judge. \nCONTIE, Circuit Judge. \nThis appeal questions the propriety of an order of the district court terminating portions of the \nremedy imposed in this school desegregation case. The appellants are the plaintiff class[1] and the \nDetroit Federation of Teachers, a defendant in intervention. The district court's order provided for the \ntermination of its jurisdiction over the Detroit school system's code of student conduct and \ncommunity relations program. It also disbanded the court-created monitoring commission. Due to \nprocedural deficiencies in the district court's actions, we find it necessary to remand for further \nproceedings. \nI. \nThis litigation began on August 18, 1970, when the plaintiff class filed a complaint alleging that public \nofficials had intentionally 268*268 segregated the Detroit school system. State and local authorities \nhave been found liable for intentional segregation. See Bradley v. Milliken, 338 F.Supp. 582 \n(E.D.Mich.1971), aff'd, 484 F.2d 215 (6th Cir.1973) (en banc). In considering the proper remedy, the \nlate District Judge Roth concluded that suburban school districts, against whom there had been no \n\nfinding of liability, would have to be included in any successful desegregation plan. See Bradley v. \nMilliken, 345 F.Supp. 914, 916 (E.D.Mich.1972). This court affirmed the inclusion of non-city school \ndistricts in a court-ordered desegregation plan. See 484 F.2d at 249. The Supreme Court disagreed, \nholding that the remedy must be limited to the Detroit school system. See Milliken v. Bradley, 418 \nU.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). \nOn remand, this case was reassigned to District Judge DeMascio in light of Judge Roth's death. The \ndesegregation plan eventually adopted by Judge DeMascio not only ordered pupil reassignment but \nalso incorporated proposals for what have come to be known as \"educational components.\" These \nelements of the plan were designed to eliminate current effects of past discrimination. They included \nitems such as remedial reading programs, guidance and counseling programs and vocational \ntraining, as well as the community relations and uniform code of student conduct programs which \nare at issue in this appeal. The state defendants appealed the propriety of four of these \"educational \ncomponents.\" We affirmed the remedy, see Bradley v. Milliken, 540 F.2d 229 (6th Cir.1976), as did \nthe Supreme Court, see Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977). \nThe three portions of the remedy at issue in this appeal were not the subject of any appeals.[2] \nThe community relations program, the uniform code of student conduct and the monitoring \ncommission came into existence as follows. On May 21, 1975, the district court ordered the Detroit \nBoard of Education to submit a proposed code of student conduct. In the district court's view, a \nuniform code of student conduct was necessary to \"protect the students against arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory exclusions, suspensions or explusions and to assure that disruptions in the school or \nclassroom will be dealt with in every instance.\" See Bradley v. Milliken, 402 F.Supp. 1096, 1142-43 \n(E.D.Mich.1975). On July 3, 1975, the district court rejected the Board's first draft of the code and \nprovided guidelines for redrafting. On October 29, 1975 the district court reviewed the second draft \nand again found defects in the Board's efforts. Instead of again sending the draft back to the Board, \nthe district court itself amended the draft. The court then ordered the use of this code. \nOn July 18, 1975, the district court requested the Detroit Board to submit a proposed community \nrelations program. See 402 F.Supp. at 1143. On May 11, 1976, the district court issued very specific \nguidelines for the structure of the program and ordered the Detroit Board to institute a community \nrelations program consistent with the court's instructions. This court-ordered program was \nsubsequently adopted. \nAn August 15, 1975 memorandum opinion stated that the \"court's order will provide for a court-\ncreated monitoring system to audit efforts made to implement the court's desegregation \norders.\" See 402 F.Supp. at 1145. The purpose of the monitoring commission was to aid the court in \nits \"obligation to audit efforts to implement its orders.\" Id. The monitoring commission came into \nformal existence on October 16, 1975, when the court accepted and adopted a plan for the \nmonitoring commission submitted by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. \nSince August of 1980, this case has been assigned to a triumvirate of district 269*269judges.[3] This \npanel now consists of Chief District Judge Feikens, District Judge Churchill and District Judge \nCohn.[4] At the time the panel assumed control of the case, there were pending motions from the \nplaintiff class for enforcement of the various educational remedies and from the Detroit Federation of \nTeachers for enforcement of the order to implement the uniform code of student conduct. The panel \nencouraged the parties to negotiate and settle these and other issues. The product of the \nnegotiations was a June 1981 stipulation between the parties. The parties agreed on the amount \nwhich the state defendants would contribute to the cost of providing for the educational remedies. To \naid in assuring compliance, the stipulation placed reporting requirements on the Detroit Board and \nthe state defendants. It also provided a date for termination of these remedies: \n\nAt the conclusion of the 1987-1988 school year, except as otherwise provided by law, the reading, \ncounseling and career guidance, uniform code of student conduct, school-community relations, \nvocational education, and bilingual-bicultural components shall be deemed completed, upon the \nfiling by the Detroit Board of Education of the final component report by March 1, 1988, and \ndefendant Detroit Board of Education shall then be relieved of any further obligation to implement \nsaid components pursuant to the Court's judgment and orders \n.... \nIn consideration of the various concessions made by the parties, the pending motions for compliance \nwere withdrawn. The question of the continued existence of a monitoring commission[5] was left \nunresolved: \nThis Agreement does not modify the prior orders of the Court concerning the authority and function \nof the Monitoring Commission, without prejudice to the right of any party to petition the Court \nconcerning changes regarding same. \nThe district court conducted public hearings on the propriety of the stipulation and on August 28, \n1981, it adopted the stipulation as an order of the court. \nOn April 24, 1984, the district court, 585 F.Supp. 348 (D.C.Mich.1984), entered the order which is \nthe subject of this appeal. It held that the court-ordered code of student conduct would be terminated \nupon the promulgation by the Detroit Board of its own code of student conduct. The order similarly \nprovided that the court-created community relations program would be terminated upon the adoption \nby the Detroit Board of its own community relations program. Both of these actions were predicated \nupon the existence of state laws which either allowed or required the Board to institute the programs \nit had formerly been under court order to implement.[6] Finally, 270*270 the court held that the \nmonitoring commission would be disbanded upon Detroit Board's compliance with the order to \ncreate its own code of student conduct and community relations program. The court based this \naction on a concern for the friction that had developed between the Detroit Board and the monitoring \ncommission and because \"with termination of the student code of conduct and the school-community \nrelations components, there is no longer any reason for us to maintain a Monitoring Commission as \nan arm of the Court.\" \nII. \nThe Detroit Board of Education filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, arguing that this court lacks \njurisdiction because of the absence of a \"final judgment\" or an appealable interlocutory order. See 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292(a)(1). We need not decide whether this order could be characterized as \"final\" \nwithin the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 or whether it might be within the \"collateral order\" exception \nto the rule requiring final judgments[7] because we conclude we have jurisdiction under § 1292(a)(1). \nThat statute gives this court jurisdiction over orders \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or \ndissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may \nbe had in the Supreme Court.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). In deciding whether an order modifies an \ninjunction and is thus appealable under § 1292(a)(1), courts have examined both whether there was \nan underlying order which was injunctive in character and whether the order being appealed can be \nsaid to have modified that initial order. See Hoots v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 587 F.2d \n1340, 1348 (3d Cir.1978). A third factor to be considered is the practical consequences of the order \nchallenged on appeal. The Supreme Court has stated: \nBecause § 1292(a)(1) was intended to carve out only a limited exception to the final-judgment rule, \nwe have construed the statute narrowly to ensure that appeal as of right under § 1292(a)(1) will be \n\navailable only in circumstances where an appeal will further the statutory purpose of \"permitting \nlitigants to effectively challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.\" \n... Unless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order of the district court might have a \"serious, \nperhaps irreparable, consequence,\" and that the order can be \"effectively challenged\" only by \nimmediate appeal, the general congressional policy against piece-meal review will preclude \ninterlocutory appeal. \nSee Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 \n(1981) (citation omitted). \nIt is clear that the underlying orders in this case — the original orders imposing the remedies and the \n1981 stipulation adopted by the court as a consent decree — were injunctive in character. The \nDetroit Board does not contend otherwise. Rather, it argues that these injunctive \norders 271*271 were not \"modified\" because the provisions of the order being appealed are \nconditional. That is, the court's order terminating the remedies was to have no effect until certain \nactions were taken by the Detroit Board. This argument overlooks the fact that the 1981 stipulation \nand consent decree provided that the duties in question would run until the end of the 1987-88 \nschool year. After the district court's order, the injunction is no longer in effect as it previously \nexisted. Thus, the district court's order clearly modified the injunction. That the actual termination of \nthose duties was made dependent upon certain events does not alter the fact that the form of the \ninjunction was altered by the district court's order. The termination of the remedies, although \nconditional, could not be said to depend upon the fulfillment of only speculative possibilities. Since \nthe Detroit Board was ordered by the district court to take the actions which would trigger the \ntermination of the previous injunctions, the order created a reasonable certainty that these events \nwould occur and the injunctions would terminate. \nFinally, we find that the interlocutory order of the district court might have a \"serious, perhaps \nirreparable, consequence\" and that it can be \"effectively challenged\" only by allowing this \nappeal. See Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996. If the appellants are correct in their assertion \nthat the district court's order prematurely terminated the injunctions, then their rights under those \ninjunctions can be fully protected only by appealing the modification before the termination actually \noccurs. Otherwise, the appellants will lose the benefit of the injunctions during the time necessary to \nprosecute the appeal. Indeed, although the appeal in this case was docketed before the actual \ntermination of the injunctions, the parties have complied with the district court's instructions and the \ninjunctions have terminated. \nAccordingly, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. \nIII. \nThe appellants' argument on appeal is primarily that the reasons stated by the district court for \nmodifying the 1981 consent decree were insufficient as a matter of law. The appellants also argue, \nhowever, that the district court erred because no one had requested the termination of the \ncommunity relations program and the uniform code of student conduct program and that they, \ntherefore, did not have appropriate notice of the nature of the inquiry to be conducted. Because we \nagree with this latter argument, we remand this case for further proceedings; and in light of this \nprocedural problem, we need not address whether the district court had the authority to act as it did \nhad the proper procedures been followed. \nA. \n\nA hearing is generally required before a district court may modify a consent decree. See Delaware \nValley Citizens' Council for Clean Air v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 674 F.2d 976, 981 (3d \nCir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 905, 103 S.Ct. 206, 74 L.Ed.2d 165 (1982); Mayberry v. Maroney, 529 \nF.2d 332, 335-36 (3d Cir.1976). A hearing is, of course, without value if the parties lack notice of the \nissues to be resolved at the hearing. Although the district court conducted a hearing in this case, it \nwas not preceded by a notice of the changes the district court had in mind. Thus, although the \nparties had an opportunity to address the district court as a general matter, they lacked an \nopportunity to address it on the specific subject of the district court's action. \nThe first order concerning the hearing in this case was entered on April 13, 1983. This order stated \nthat \"[i]t now appears appropriate that the court determine the future role of the monitoring \ncommission and consider the manner of assuring compliance by the Detroit Board of Education with \nthe orders relating to the educational components and particularly the stipulation of the parties \nregarding implementation of the educational components.\" This hearing 272*272 was subsequently \ndelayed. On December 8, 1983, the district court issued an order rescheduling the hearing for \nJanuary 25, 1984 \"as the adjourned date of the hearing set in the order of April 13, 1983.\" The order \nalso requested the parties to address the sufficiency of a compliance report issued by the Detroit \nBoard. Neither of these orders stated that the hearing would be concerned with the termination of \nthe community relations program or the uniform code of student conduct. Indeed, since the April 13, \n1983 order stated that the hearing would address \"the manner of assuring compliance\" with the \norders implementing the educational components, the order, if anything, seemed to contemplate the \ncontinued existence of those two programs. The possibility of termination was mentioned only in \nconnection with the monitoring commission. \nThe transcript of the hearing itself reveals that the termination of the community relations program \nand the uniform code of student conduct were not contemplated. The court stated that the hearing \nwas to address \"one, the future role of the Monitoring Commission; and two, the manner of assuring \ncompliance with the Order relating to the educational components.\" The court also noted that \"we \nbroadened that Order\" so that consideration would also be given to the parties' \"respective positions \nregarding the reports of the Detroit Board of Education and the responses.\" Not surprisingly, the \narguments of counsel at this hearing focused on the sufficiency of the defendants compliance with \nthe district court's orders and the sufficiency of their required reports. In a manner consistent with the \norders calling for the hearing, the only program which was discussed in connection with termination \nwas the monitoring commission. \nThe parties thus had no notice that the district court contemplated terminating its jurisdiction over the \ncommunity relations program and the code of student conduct.[8]Because the parties did not have an \nopportunity to address the district court on the propriety of such actions, that portion of the order \nproviding for the termination of those programs must be vacated. The parties did have notice that the \n\"future role\" of the monitoring commission was in issue. Nonetheless, this portion of the district \ncourt's order must also be vacated. One of the two reasons given by the district court for terminating \nthe monitoring commission was that it would have no function to perform in light of the termination of \nthe community relations program and the court-ordered code of student conduct. Since one of the \npremises of the district court's reasoning no longer obtains, that portion of the order providing for the \ntermination of the monitoring commission no longer rests upon adequate grounds. We reiterate that \nwe have no occasion to pass on whether the reasons advanced by the district court for terminating \nthese three programs would be sufficient had the termination been preceded by proper procedures. \nAfter appropriate notice and hearing, the District Court should make sufficiently detailed findings of \nfact and conclusions of law under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., to advise the parties of the factual basis \nfor its decision and permit informed appellate review. \nB. \n\nAt oral argument, the parties questioned what type of order this court should enter in the event that \nwe did not affirm the district court. Since we are vacating the order of the district court that \nterminated two of the three programs at issue, the legal effect of our judgment is to return this case \nautomatically to the status quo ante. That is, since the order of the district court providing for \ntermination of the previous injunctions and the consent decree is without legal effect, the earlier \nprovisions are automatically resuscitated. The 273*273 court is concerned, however, that an \nautomatic and immediate return to the status quo ante might disrupt orderly school procedures. We \ntherefore grant the district court a limited discretion to enter an order to provide for a smooth \ntransition back to those programs. We wish to emphasize, however, that any such order shall only \nbe for the purpose of effectuating a smooth and speedy transition to the status quo ante. We also \nsuggest that the district court schedule the hearing required by this opinion at the earliest possible \ndate. \nIV. \nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is \nREMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We direct the clerk to issue the mandate \nupon the entry of judgment. Fed.R.App.Pro. 41(a). Costs are taxed to the appellees. \n[1] The plaintiff class consists of Ronald Bradley, who was a school-aged child at the time the suit was filed, his mother, \nvarious other named individuals and their parents and a class consisting of \"all parents having children attending the public \nschools of the City of Detroit, Michigan, on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children.\" The NAACP has also \nparticipated in this action as a party plaintiff. The defendants are state and local educational officials and agencies, including \nthe State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Detroit Board of Education. \n[2] The only portions of the remedy challenged on appeal were those providing for a remedial reading program, in-service \ntraining, revised testing procedures and a counseling and career guidance program. See 433 U.S. at 275-76, 97 S.Ct. at \n2754-55; 540 F.2d at 240-41. \n[3] In an appeal unrelated to the issues in this case, we found that Judge DeMascio had correctly denied a motion for \nrecusal. We nonetheless held that despite the propriety of Judge DeMascio's ruling, the \"bitter feelings that have developed\" \ncounseled for a prophylatic reassignment. See Bradley v. Milliken, 620 F.2d 1143, 1158 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. \n870, 101 S.Ct. 207, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980); Bradley v. Milliken, 495 F.Supp. 217 (E.D.Mich.1980) (opinion on remand). \n[4] District Judge Boyle was originally a member of this panel. Judge Churchill replaced Judge Boyle when the latter left the \ndistrict court to join the Michigan Supreme Court. \n[5] The future role of the monitoring commission was first questioned by Judge DeMascio in a 1978 opinion. See Bradley v. \nMilliken, 460 F.Supp. 299, 318-20 (E.D.Mich.1978). \n[6] In discussing the code of student conduct, the district court stated: \n[O]ur review of the laws of Michigan relating to the authority of the State Board of Education, the State Superintendent and \nthe Detroit Board tells us that there is ample legal authority for placing complete responsibility for assuring discipline in the \nDetroit schools, which is the goal of the student code of conduct, in the statutorily constituted agencies without the need of \ncourt supervision. \n. . . . . \nAccordingly we are bringing an end to the requirement that our student code of conduct be part of the remedy in this case. \nWe will provide ample lead time for the Detroit Board to adopt a student code of conduct. \nIn discussing the community relations program, the court stated: \n[O]n August 11, 1983 the Detroit Board filed a motion to allow changes in the school-community relations program now in \nplace. The Detroit Board noted that a recent amendment in Michigan law requires such a program. The Monitoring \n\nCommission and the parties responded that the present program complied with the new law and there was no need to \nrelieve the Detroit Board of the obligation to maintain this component. More important, it appeared to us that state law \nprovides ample authority for assuring a proper school-community relations program in the Detroit school system and that \nthere is no present need for a court-ordered school-community relations program. \nAccordingly, we are bringing to an end the requirement of our school-community relations program as part of the remedy in \nthis case. We will provide ample lead time for the Detroit Board to put in place a school-community relations program. \nThe court's provisions for the termination dates of both programs were identical. The community relations program and the \ncourt-created code of student conduct were to terminate upon the adoption of similar programs by the Detroit Board. This \nadoption was to occur by December 31, 1984. \n[7] See generally Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); Cohen v. Beneficial \nIndustrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). \n[8] On August 10, 1983, the Detroit Board moved to terminate the community relations program. This motion was not \nmentioned, however, in the order setting the January hearing. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the parties had an \nopportunity to address the propriety of terminating the community relations program. \n ",

This effort \nwas thwarted by an Act of the Michigan Legislature, Act No. 48, effective July 7, 1970, a copy of \nwhich is made an appendix to this opinion. \nThe appeal is under 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (a) from the interlocutory order of the District Court entered \nSeptember 3, 1970, which, among other things, refused to grant a preliminary injunction. \nThe plaintiffs are pupils and parents of pupils who attend the Detroit Public Schools, and the Detroit \nBranch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The defendants are the \nGovernor of Michigan, the Attorney General of Michigan, the Acting State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction, the State Board of Education, the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, three \nmembers of the latter board,[1] and the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools. \n\nOn April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan which provided for changes in \ntwelve high school attendance zones, designed to effect a more balanced ratio of Negro and white \nstudents at the senior high school level. The plan was applicable to twelve of the twenty-one high \nschools in Detroit that serve particular neighborhood or geographical areas. The April 7 plan was to \ntake effect over a three-year period, applying initially to those students entering the tenth grade in \nSeptember 1970 at the beginning of 1970-71 school year. In successive stages the eleventh grade \nwas to have been affected at the opening of the 1971-72 school year, and the twelfth grade at the \nbeginning of the 1972-73 school year. \nDr. Norman Drachler, the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, testified that the plan was \nadopted after an extended study. He described the purpose of the plan as follows: \n\"Q What was the purpose of the plan as adopted? \n\"A The purpose of the plan was, in addition to complying with the regulations of the State Act 244, to \nbring about a decentralized school system within the city which would allow for the election of \nregional boards which would bring about greater participation at the local level by the community. \nThat it would undoubtedly, in the opinion of most of us, add towards the improvement of quality \neducation, quality integrated education insofar as possible. \n899*899 \"The Board of Education has, as long as I can recall, always accepted the premise that the \ntask of improving education is a very complex one in a large city, but they have consistently held to \nthe premise that wherever possible, wherever reasonably we can bring about integration in the \nprocess of developing our educational program, that this would enhance the opportunity of all \nchildren, black and white, both in terms of their educational achievement as well as their potential as \nresponsible citizens in a democracy. \n\"So in this plan the Board saw an opportunity, the majority, that we could at the high school level in \nsome twelve high schools bring about over a three-year period a certain amount of integration \nalthough it involved only the movement of some ten to twelve thousand children over the three-year \nperiod, nevertheless, that is, the transfer of 12,000 children in three years — nevertheless these \nchildren were in twelve schools which involved about 35,000 students, which is over 50 per cent of \nour total high school enrollment. \n\"We have certain high schools that are already integrated. Thus, we saw this as a step not only \ntoward achieving a goal of the decentralization act but also the broader goal which the Board has \nalways had of quality integrated education.\" \nThe Board of Education adopted the plan by a vote of four to two, with one member absent because \nof illness. This seventh member, who is represented to have favored the plan but was unable to \nvote, has since died and his vacancy has been filled. \nAt the time the April 7 plan was adopted, Dr. Drachler, the Superintendent of Public Schools, issued \nthe following statement: \n\"As an educator I support the proposed plan because I believe that it is educationally, morally and \naccording to our attorney legally sound. Most of the research and scholarship, both by blacks and \nwhites that I respect, supports the view that integration, racial, religious and economic, has a positive \neffect on the learning of all children in a pluralistic society. As a student of American educational \nhistory I recognize that the above goal has been the dream of our nation for over a century. Local, \nstate and national polls assert that the majority of our people concur with the desirability of \nintegration and believe that eventually it will be a reality in our nation. \n\"Let us, therefore, have a plan for self renewal of our schools and our community rather than drift in \nthe climate of uncertainty, fear and frustration. I recognize that our primary objective as teachers is \nquality education but to repeat, the majority of accepted research and scholarship asserts that \n\nquality education in a heterogeneous society such as ours can not be attained to its fullest measure \nwithout integration. It is essential for white and black, for poor and rich. \n\"This plan directly affects only our high school students. Without it each constellation will continue a \ngrowing pattern of segregated racial or economic enclaves and be concerned only with the \neducational welfare of its own immediate area. This proposal, however, encourages a broader \ncommunity concern for educational improvement and assures greater interest and support for quality \neducation for tens of thousands of children wherever they attend school. \n\"Since as a people we concur with the necessity for eliminating religious, racial and economic \nbarriers, let us, therefore, begin with a plan, however limited it is, let us begin where we are and \nmove forward. \n\"America has been willing to deprive itself of billions of dollars to travel 900*900250,000 miles in \nspace to reach the moon, I am confident Detroiters will be willing to accept the idea of traveling one \nor two additional miles to school for the sake of a better education for our young people and for a \nbetter future for our city.\" \nThe plan was approved by the Michigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development \nby the following resolution: \n\"Whereas racial integration is legally, morally and scientifically right, and Whereas, the President of \nthe United States has stated that `quality is what education is all about' desegregation is vital to that \nquality, and, Whereas, the Board of Education of the Detroit Public Schools has approved a plan for \nhigh school students which effectively increases racial integration, therefore, Be It Resolved, that the \nMichigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development recognizes, endorses and \nvigorously supports this long needed and forward step for the future of America.\" \nThe plan was endorsed by other national and local agencies and organizations, including the United \nStates Office of Education, the defendant Michigan State Board of Education and the Michigan Civil \nRights Commission. \nFollowing adoption of the plan on April 7, 1970, Detroit School officials began to prepare procedures \nto carry it into effect at the beginning of the 1970-71 school year. \nThe Michigan Legislature enacted, and on July 7, 1970, the Governor of Michigan signed into law, \nAct No. 48, Public Acts of 1970. \nSection 12 of this Act is as follows: \n\"Sec. 12. The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 school year determined \nby any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of \nfunctions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory \nact but such provision shall not impair the right of any such board to determine and implement prior \nto such date such changes in attendance provisions as are mandated by practical necessity. In \nreviewing, confirming, establishing or modifying attendance provisions the first class school district \nboards established under the provisions of this amendatory act shall have a policy of open \nenrollment and shall enable students to attend a school of preference but providing priority \nacceptance, insofar as practicable, in cases of insufficient school capacity, to those students residing \nnearest the school and to those students desiring to attend the school for participation in vocationally \noriented courses or other specialized curriculum.\" \nBy its terms this statute applies only to \"first class school districts.\" The Detroit School system is the \nonly \"first class school district\" in Michigan. Although on its face the statute is a general Act, it is \napplicable only to one local school system in the State.[2] \n\nFollowing enactment of Act 48, the Superintendent of Detroit City Schools requested an opinion from \nthe attorney for the Board of Education as to the effect of this statute. This opinion, dated July 28, \n1970, contains the following language with respect to § 12: \n\"The answer to this question is found in Section 12 of Act 48. Section 12 says: \n`The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 901*901school year determined \nby any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of \nfunctions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory \nact * * *.' \n\"This quoted portion of Section 12 obviously, albeit indirectly, addresses itself to the action taken by \nthe Board on April 7, 1970, with respect to establishing new high school attendance areas. In our \nopinion, the effect of this provision is to rescind — for at least one year — the attempt made by the \nBoard of Education on April 7, 1970, to achieve integration in its high schools. While Act 48 itself \npurports only to delay implementation until January 1, 1971, it is well known that no implementation \nbegun even on January 1, 1971, could be placed into operation earlier than the beginning of the Fall \nsemester in September, 1971. For these reasons we deem it unnecessary to recommend that the \nBoard's action on April 7, 1970, establishing high school attendance areas be rescinded.\" \nFurther, a movement was initiated by certain Detroit voters to recall the four members of the Detroit \nSchool Board who had voted in favor of the April 7, 1970, plan. The recall movement was resolved \nat the August 4, 1970, election, which resulted in the recall and removal from office of the four board \nmembers who voted in favor of the April 7 plan. As stated in footnote 1, these four positions were \nvacant at the time the complaint was filed and on August 31, 1970, were filled by appointment by the \nGovernor. \nIn accordance with the opinion of the attorney for the Board of Education quoted above, Detroit \nschool officials did not put the April 7 plan into effect for the 1970-71 school year beginning in \nSeptember 1970. The Superintendent of City Schools testified that he instructed regional \nsuperintendents that \"we had to go back to the plan of April 6.\" The principals of the affected high \nschools sent out letters or otherwise notified students that regardless of any previous instructions to \nthe contrary, they should attend the high school they would have attended prior to April 7. It is \nundisputed, that, obedient to the mandate of § 12 of Act 48, the plan adopted by the Board of \nEducation on April 7, has been suspended, or at least deferred to a time beyond January 1, 1971. \nThe high schools in question have reverted to the attendance zones which were in effect prior to the \nApril 7 action of the Board. The tenth grade students who would have attended a high school with an \nimproved racial balance as determined by the Board of Education on April 7 have been deprived of \nthat opportunity from the beginning of the 1970-71 school year until the time of the rendering of this \nopinion. \nOn August 18, 1970, plaintiffs filed their complaint in the present case as a class action, attacking \nthe constitutionality of § 12 of Act 48. Among other things the complaint prayed for a preliminary \ninjunction requiring defendants to put into effect the plan adopted by the Detroit Board of Education \non April 7 and restraining defendants from giving any force or effect to § 12 of Act 48 insofar as it \nwould inhibit immediate implementation of the Board's plan of April 7. \nDistrict Judge Stephen J. Roth advanced the case and scheduled a prompt hearing. Evidentiary \nhearings were conducted by Judge Roth for three days on August 27-28, and September 1, 1970. \nThe testimony at these hearings comprises three typewritten volumes. On September 3, 1970, \nJudge Roth released a written opinion denying the application for a preliminary injunction and \ngranting a motion to dismiss the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan as parties defendant. \nThe District Court did not pass upon the issue of the constitutionality of § 12 of Act 48. \n\nThe case was advanced on the docket of the District Court for hearing on its merits beginning \nNovember 2, 1970. The trial is scheduled to start on that 902*902 date. Two weeks have been \nallotted by the District Court for this trial. \nOn September 3, the same day the decision of the District Court was announced, defendants filed a \nnotice of appeal and a motion in this Court for injunction pending appeal. Oral arguments on this \nmotion were heard in Nashville, Tennessee, by the Chief Judge of the Circuit September 8, 1970, \npursuant to Rule 8, Fed.R.App.P.[3] The Detroit public schools opened for the 1970-71 school term \non September 8, the day of the hearing before the Chief Judge in Nashville. \nThe Chief Judge entered an order denying the application for injunction pending appeal and \nadvanced the appeal for hearing on its merits before this Court in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 2, \n1970, at 2 p.m. This opinion is rendered after consideration of the briefs and oral arguments of the \nparties and the record and transcript of the evidence and proceedings in the District Court. \nThree questions will be disposed of at the present stage of the proceeding: \n(1) The issue of the constitutionality of § 12 of Act 48 (Appendix hereto); \n(2) Whether the District Judge abused his discretion in denying the application for a preliminary \ninjunction; \n(3) Whether the District Court erred in dismissing the Governor and Attorney General as parties \ndefendant. \n1) The Michigan Statute \nWe first consider the issue of the constitutionality of the statute. \nAs previously stated, the plan adopted by the Detroit Board of Education was designed to provide a \nbetter balance between students of the Negro and white races in twelve high schools. If this plan \nhad come into existence under a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District \nof Michigan, there could be no question that § 12 of Act 48 would be void. The Legislature of a State \ncannot annul the judgments nor determine the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States. United \nStates v. Peters, 9 U.S. 115, 3 L.Ed. 53 (1809). \nIn the present case the April 7 plan came into being, not as the result of a judgment of a District \nCourt, but by the voluntary action of the Detroit Board of Education in its effort further to implement \nthe mandate of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 \nL.Ed. 873, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083,and succeeding cases, such as Alexander v. \nHolmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19, and Green v. County \nSchool Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716. The \nimplementation of the April 7 plan was thwarted by State action in the form of the Act of the \nLegislature of Michigan. \nIn numerous decisions the Supreme Court and other federal courts have held that State action in \nany form, whether by statute, act of the executive department of a State or local government, or \notherwise, will not be permitted to impede, delay or frustrate proceedings to protect the rights \nguaranteed to members of all races under the Fourteenth Amendment. See: \n\nHunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 89 S.Ct. 557, 21 L.Ed.2d 616, holding that the repeal by \nreferendum of the fair housing ordinance previously adopted by the City Council of Akron, Ohio, \n\"discriminates against minorities, and constitutes a real, substantial, and invidious denial of the equal \nprotection of the laws.\" 393 U.S. at 393, 89 S.Ct. at 562. \nReitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830, holding invalid a provision of the \nConstitution of California, adopted by state-wide referendum, 903*903 which nullified previously \nenacted statutes regulating racial discrimination in housing and authorized \"racial discrimination in \nthe housing market.\" 387 U.S. at 381, 87 S.Ct. at 1634. \nGriffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d \n256, and cases cited therein, invalidating the \"massive resistence\" legislation enacted by the Virginia \nLegislature designed to prevent or delay school integration, and requiring reopening of public \nschools of Prince Edwards County. \nCooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 9, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 19, nullifying a 1956 amendment to the \nConstitution of Arkansas which commmanded the Arkansas legislature to oppose \"in every \nconstitutional manner the unconstitutional desegregation decisions\" of the Supreme Court, and \nvarious State statutes enacted for that purpose. \nKelley v. Board of Education of City of Nashville, 270 F.2d 209 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 924, \n80 S.Ct. 293, 4 L.Ed.2d 240, holding a Tennessee statute authorizing separate segregated schools \non a voluntary basis to be \"patently and manifestly unconstitutional on its face.\" 270 F.2d at 231. \nLee et al. v. Nyquist, Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, (W.D.N.Y.) 318 F.Supp. \n710 (three-judge court, Sept. 29, 1970), which held invalid under the equal protection clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment § 3201(2) of the New York Education Law, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 16, \nwhich \"prohibits state education officials and appointed school boards from assigning students, or \nestablishing, reorganizing or maintaining school districts, school zones or attendance units for the \npurpose of achieving racial equality in attendance.\" 318 F.Supp. 713.[4] \nKeyes v. School District Number One, Denver, Colorado, 313 F.Supp. 61, 303 F.Supp. 279, and 303 \nF.Supp. 289 (D. Colo.), 396 U.S. 1215, 90 S.Ct. 12, 24 L.Ed.2d 37,involving a school desegregation \nplan adopted by a school board and an effort to rescind this plan made by the same Board after \nchanges in membership following a school board election. \nHolmes v. Leadbetter, 294 F.Supp. 991 (E.D.Mich.) enjoining a proposed referendum to submit an \nopen housing ordinance to voters of Detroit. \nBush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 188 F.Supp. 916 (E.D.La.), aff'd, 365 U.S. 569, 81 S.Ct. 754, \n5 L.Ed.2d 806, holding invalid twenty-five measures adopted by the Louisiana Legislature in an effort \nto circumvent partial desegregation of New Orleans public schools. \nAaron v. McKinley, 173 F.Supp. 944 (E.D.Ark.), aff'd, sub nom. Faubus, Governor v. Aaron, 361 U.S. \n197, 80 S.Ct. 291, 4 L.Ed.2d 237, holding unconstitutional two Arkansas statutes authorizing the \nGovernor to close schools and to call for school district elections on the question of whether schools \nin such districts be integrated, and withholding State school funds from districts in which schools \nhave been closed because of integration. \nThe foregoing are a few cases selected from the many decisions holding that State action cannot be \ninterposed to delay, obstruct or nullify steps lawfully taken for the purpose of protecting rights \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nDefendants assert that § 12 is a valid exercise of legislative power. It is true that, as a general rule, a \nState legislature has plenary power over the arms and instrumentalities of State government, \nincluding local boards of education. This power cannot be exercised, however, so as to deprive \nindividuals of constitutionally protected rights. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 \nL.Ed.2d 110, distinguishing City of Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 904*904 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 \nL.Ed. 937, Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151, and related cases. \nMr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court in Gomillion, said: \n\"When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal \njudicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for \ncircumventing a federally protected right. This principle has had many applications. It has long been \nrecognized in cases which have prohibited a State from exploiting a power acknowledged to be \nabsolute in an isolated context to justify the imposition of an `unconstitutional condition.' What the \nCourt has said in those cases is equally applicable here, viz., that `Acts generally lawful may \nbecome unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end, United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. \n324, 357, 33 S.Ct. 90, 57 L.Ed. 243,and a constitutional power cannot be used by way of condition \nto attain an unconstitutional result.' Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, 247 U.S. 105, 114, 38 \nS.Ct. 438, 439, 62 L.Ed. 1006.\" 364 U.S. at 347, 81 S.Ct. at 130. \nDefendants rely upon the decision of this Court in Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d \n55, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114, 419 F.2d 1387 (6th Cir.). Deal is \ndistinguishable on its facts from the present case. In Deal this Court held that the school board of a \nlong-established unitary non-racial school system had no constitutional obligation to bus white and \nNegro children away from districts of their residences in order that racial complexion be balanced in \neach of the many public schools in the City. In the present case the Detroit Board of Education in the \nexercise of its discretion took affirmative steps on its own initiative to effect an improved racial \nbalance in twelve senior high schools. This action was thwarted, or at least delayed, by an act of the \nState Legislature. No comparable situation was presented in Deal. \nDefendants defend the constitutionality of the second sentence of § 12 of Act 48 on the ground that \nthe word \"shall,\" which appears twice in that sentence, was intended to mean \"may,\" and that the \nsentence is not mandatory. We reject this interpretation of the sentence. We find nothing in the Act \nto indicate any intention on the part of the Legislature to leave the application of this sentence to the \ndiscretion of local school officials. We are cited to nothing in the legislative history to support such an \ninterpretation. The word \"shall\" is ordinarily \"the language of command.\" Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 \nU.S. 482, 485, 67 S.Ct. 428, 91 L.Ed. 436; Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 \nL.Ed. 1566. We interpret the word \"shall\" in the second sentence of § 12 as meaning precisely what \nthe Michigan legislature said. We conclude that this sentence was enacted with the intention that it \nbe mandatory. \nWe hold § 12 of Act 48 to be unconstitutional and of no effect as violative of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. By this ruling on the invalidity of § 12, we express no opinion at the present stage of \nthe case as to the merits of the plan adopted by the School Board on April 7, 1970, or as to whether \nit was the constitutional obligation of the School Board to adopt all or any part of that plan. \n2) Denial of Preliminary Injunction \nAlthough holding that § 12 of Act 48 is unconstitutional, we cannot say that the District Judge abused \nhis discretion in refusing to grant a preliminary injunction upon the basis of the evidence introduced \nduring the three days of hearings. \n\nThe granting or denial of a preliminary injunction pending final hearing on the merits is within the \nsound judicial discretion of the District Court. On appeal, the action of the District Court denying a \npreliminary injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity or result of \nimprovident exercise of judicial discretion. 905*905 Nashville I-40 Steering Committee v. Ellington, \n387 F.2d 179 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 921, 88 S.Ct. 857, 19 L.Ed.2d 982. \nThe complaint in the present case seeks relief going beyond the scope of the plan of April 7, 1970, \nand Act 48, such as the assignment of teachers, principals and other school personnel to each \nschool in accordance with the ratio of white and Negro personnel throughout the Detroit school \nsystem, and an injunction against all future construction of public school buildings pending Court \napproval. As previously stated, the District Judge not only conducted an expeditious hearing on the \napplication for a preliminary injunction, but has advanced the case on his docket to November 2, \n1970, and allotted two weeks for the trial. \nWe conclude that the issues presented in this case, involving the public school system of a large \ncity, can best be determined only after a full evidentiary hearing. \nIn the trial of the case on its merits, the District Judge is directed to give no effect to § 12 of Act 48, \nbecause of its unconstitutionality. \n3) The Governor and Attorney General as parties \ndefendant \nDefendants appeal from the order of the District Court dismissing the Governor and Attorney \nGeneral of Michigan as parties defendant. We hold that the Governor and Attorney General are \nproper parties, at least at the present stage of the proceeding. Compare: Sterling v. Constantin, 287 \nU.S. 378, 393, 53 S.Ct. 190, 77 L.Ed. 375; Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157, 161, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 \nL.Ed. 714; Arneson v. Denny, 25 F.2d 993 (W.D.Wash.); James v. Almond, 170 F.Supp. 331, 341-\n342 (E.D. Va.), appeal dismissed, 359 U.S. 1006, 79 S.Ct. 1146, 3 L.Ed.2d 987; Bevins v. Prindable, \n39 F.Supp. 708, 710 (E.D.Ill.), aff'd, 314 U.S. 573, 62 S.Ct. 116, 86 L.Ed. 465. \nThat part of the order of the District Court dismissing the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan \nas parties defendant is reversed. \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not \ninconsistent with this opinion. \nAPPENDIX \nTEXT OF ACT 48 — PUBLIC ACT OF 1970 \nApproved by the Governor — July 7, 1970 State of \nMichigan — 75th Legislature — Regular Session of \n1970 \nAn Act to amend the title and sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Act No. 244 of the Public Acts of 1969, \nentitled \"An act to require first class school districts to be divided into regional districts and to provide \n\nfor local district school boards and to define their powers and duties and the powers and duties of \nthe first class district board,\" being sections 388.174, 388.175, 388.176 and 388.177 of the Compiled \nLaws of 1948; to add sections 1a, 2a, 3a and 8 to 13; and to repeal certain acts and parts of acts. \nThe People of the State of Michigan enact: \nSection 1. The title and sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Act No. 244 of the Public Acts of 1969, being \nsections 388.174, 388.175, 388.176 and 388.177 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, are amended and \nsections 1a, 2a, 3a and 8 to 13 are added to read as follows: \nTITLE \nAn act to require first class school districts to be divided into regions and to provide for regional \nboards and to define their powers and duties and the powers and duties of the first class district \nboard. \nSec. 1a. On or after January 1, 1971, in any first class school district with more than 100,000 student \nmembership, the board membership of the board of education shall be composed of 8 members \ndetermined and elected as provided 906*906 in section 2a plus 5 members determined and elected \nas provided in section 3a. \nSec. 2a. Immediately following the effective date of this 1970 amendatory act or any date on which a \nschool district becomes a first class school district, 8 regions shall be described in each such first \nclass school district by resolution concurred in by three-fourths of the members elected and serving \nin each House of the legislature and such regions so described shall be established as regions if and \nwhen approved by the superintendent of public instruction. If a concurrent resolution shall not be \napproved by three-fourths of such members within 7 days of the effective date of this amendatory \nact or within 30 days of any date on which a school district becomes a first class school district a first \nclass district boundary commission consisting of 3 members appointed by the governor shall \ndetermine the boundary lines of such regions within 21 days thereafter if in 1970 or within 30 days \nthereafter if in any later year. The members of the commission shall receive a compensation of \n$100.00 per diem per member from the funds appropriated to the department of education. The \nboundary lines of such regions shall be redetermined by the respective boards of such first class \nschool districts following each federal decennial census but in no event later than April 15 of the first \nodd numbered year in which regional board members are to be elected following the federal \ndecennial census. In the event of the failure of such respective boards of such first class school \ndistricts to redetermine such regional boundary lines by such April 15, the state board of education \nshall convene within 10 days to make such redetermination and such redetermination of the state \nboard of education shall be the regional boundary lines until the redetermination is made following \nthe next succeeding federal decennial census as provided in this section. Regions shall be as \ncompact, contiguous and nearly equal in population as practicable. \nWithin each region, there shall be a regional board consisting of 5 members. The members shall be \nnominated and elected by the registered and qualified electors of each district as is provided by law \nfor the nomination and election of first class school board members except that signatures required \non nominating petitions shall be not less than 500 nor more than 1,000. Any candidate properly filed \nfor any educational position in any first class school district as of the effective date of this act shall be \nconsidered as a qualified candidate under sections 2a and 3a for the 1970 election provided such \ncandidate makes a request, designation and selection to the election officer empowered by law to \naccept nominating petitions for such office. No person shall be elected who is not a resident of the \n\nregion from which he is elected. The members shall be elected in the general election to be held in \nNovember, 1970 and November of 1973 and every 2 years thereafter commencing in 1975. \nIn the year 1970 regional board members shall be elected in the November general election and \ncandidates for such offices shall not be subject to the primary election. In 1970 a person may qualify \nas a candidate for the election for regional board member by filing the required number of signatures \non or prior to 4 p. m., August 18, 1970. In 1970 signatures of registered electors of the first class \ndistrict shall be valid without regard to the place of residence of such registered elector. In any year \nthe candidate for regional board member receiving the highest number of votes in each region in the \nNovember general election shall be chairman of the regional board and a member of the board of \neducation of his first class school district during his term of office. In case a vacancy occurs for any \nreason in the combined position of chairman of the regional board and member of the first class \nschool district board of education, the regional board member who received the next highest number \nof votes in the preceding general election shall assume 907*907 such combined position. The \nnumber of members of each regional board shall be maintained at 5 and vacancies shall be filled \nfrom among residents of the region by the remaining board members of such region by a majority \nvote of those serving. No vacancies shall be filled later than 60 days prior to a primary election at \nwhich regional board members are to be nominated. The 5 regional board members elected in each \nregion shall commence their terms of office on January 1 following the election and the members \nshall serve until their successors are elected and qualified. \nSec. 3a. Effective January 1, 1971 there shall be 5 members on the boards of first class school \ndistricts elected at large. Members of such boards shall be nominated and elected at the primary and \ngeneral elections of 1972 and 1974 for 3-year terms commencing on January 1 of the subsequent \nodd number year, 2 each to be elected in 1972 and 1974. In the year 1970 1 board member shall be \nelected in the November general election for a 3-year term commencing January 1, 1971 and \ncandidates shall not be subject to the primary election. In 1970 a person may qualify as a candidate \nfor the election for first class school district board member by filing nominating petitions containing \nnot less than 500 nor more than 1,000 valid signatures on or before 4 p. m., August 18, 1970. \nCommencing in 1973 and in all subsequent odd numbered years, a number of board members \nequivalent to the number of members whose terms expire on December 31 of such year will be \nnominated and elected at the primary and general election. Such members so elected shall serve 2-\nyear terms commencing on January 1 of the subsequent even numbered year. To accomplish the \nprovisions of this amendatory act the terms of office of any first class district board members whose \nterms expire prior to December 31, 1971 shall expire December 31, 1970; the terms of office of such \nboard members whose terms expire between January 1, 1972 and December 31, 1973 shall expire \nDecember 31, 1972 and the terms of office of such board members whose terms expire between \nJanuary 1, 1974 and December 31, 1975 shall expire December 31, 1974. \nIn any year in which one or more board members of a first class district are commencing a term of \noffice on January 1 the board of such first class district shall redetermine its selection of officers \nduring the month of January of such year. Petitions to recall any member or members of the board of \neducation of a first class school district filed and pending before this act becomes effective, or \nbecomes operative in a school district that hereafter becomes a first class school district, may be \nwithdrawn by the person or organization filing or sponsoring such recall petitions within 10 days after \nthis act becomes effective or 20 days after the act becomes operative in any school district that \nhereafter becomes a first class school district. Board members of first class school districts who are \nrecalled in accordance with law may be candidates for the same office at the next election for such \noffice at which the recalled member is otherwise eligible. In the case of any school district that \nhereafter becomes a first class school district, the term of office of each of the board members then \nserving in such school district shall expire on the next succeeding December 31 of an odd numbered \nyear, provided however that if the school district becomes a first class school district later than April \n1 of an odd numbered year, the term of office of each of its board members shall expire on \n\nDecember 31 of the next succeeding odd numbered year later than the year in which the district \nbecame a first class school district. For any district becoming a first class district 5 school board \nmembers shall be elected in the general election of the odd numbered year in which such terms of \noffice expire and the 5 school board members so elected shall commence 2-year terms on January \n1 of the even numbered year following such general election. \nIn case a vacancy occurs for any reason on the first class district board such 908*908vacancy shall \nbe filled by majority vote of all persons serving as regional board and first class district board \nmembers at a meeting called by the president of the first class district board for such purpose. No \nvacancies shall be filled later than 60 days prior to a primary election at which first class district \nboard members are to be nominated. Vacancies which shall occur prior to the effective date of this \nact or have occurred in 1970, shall be filled for a term ending December 31, 1972 in the same \nmanner as provided in this section for the election of board members at large in the year 1970 and \nsuch positions shall then be filled in the primary and general election of 1972 for a 3 year term. In \n1970 the candidate receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected for the 3 year term and \nthe candidates receiving the next highest number of votes shall be elected for 2 year terms to fill \nvacancies. \nSec. 4. A candidate for a regional board must be 21 years of age at the time of filing and must reside \nin the region in which he becomes a candidate. If his legal residence is moved from the region \nduring his term of office, it shall constitute a vacating of office. \nSec. 5. The first class school district board shall retain all the powers and duties now possessed by a \nfirst class school district except for those given to a regional board under the provisions of this act \nand such other functions as are delegated to the regional boards by the first class school district \nboard. \nSec. 6. Effective upon the commencement of its term of office, the regional board, subject to \nguidelines established by the first class district board, shall have the power to: \n(1) Employ a superintendent for the schools in the region from a list or lists of candidates submitted \nby the first class district board and to discharge any such regional superintendent. \n(2) Employ and discharge, assign and promote all teachers and other employees of the region and \nschools therein subject to review by the first class school district board, which may overrule, modify \nor affirm the action of the regional board. \n(3) Determine the curriculum, use of educational facilities and establishment of educational and \ntesting programs in the region and schools therein. \n(4) Determine the budget for the region and schools therein based upon the allocation of funds \nreceived from the first class school district board. \nSec. 7. The rights of retirement, tenure, seniority and of any other benefits of any employee \ntransferred to a region or schools therein from the first class district or transferred between regions \nshall not be abrogated, diminished or impaired. \nSec. 8. The first class school district board shall perform the following functions for the regions and \nschools therein: \n(1) Central purchasing. \n\n(2) Payroll. \n(3) Contract negotiations for all employees, subject to the provisions of Act No. 336 of the Public \nActs of 1947, as amended, being sections 423.201 to 423.216 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, and \nsubject to any bargaining certification and to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement \npertaining to affected employees. \n(4) Property Management and Maintenance. \n(5) Bonding. \n(6) Special education programs. \n(7) Allocation of funds for capital outlay and operations for each region and schools therein. \n(8) Establish or modify guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of section 6. Such \nguidelines shall include but not be limited to the determination and specification of each regional \nboard's jurisdiction and may provide for regional board's jurisdiction over schools not geographically \nlocated within their respective regions. \nSec. 9. Facilities and accommodations provided by the first class school district board for regional \nboards shall be 909*909 selected with due consideration for accessibility, economy and utilization of \nexisting facilities. Employees assigned by the first class school district board to regional boards at \nthe time of commencement of their functions shall be drawn, to the extent feasible, from persons \nemployed at such time by the first class school district. \nSec. 10. Regional board members shall be paid a per diem allowance of $20.00 for each meeting of \ntheir board attended and first class district board members shall be paid a per diem allowance of \n$30.00 for each meeting of their board attended, but in neither case shall such payments be for \nmeetings in excess of 52 meetings per annum. The chairman of each regional board shall be paid \nfor up to 52 regional board meetings attended and up to 52 first class district board meetings \nattended. \nSec. 11. First class school districts with 100,000 student membership or more shall have the same \nrights for initiative petition and referendum now granted by law to second and third class districts. \nSec. 12. The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 school year determined \nby any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of \nfunctions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory \nact but such provision shall not impair the right of any such board to determine and implement prior \nto such date such changes in attendance provisions as are mandated by practical necessity. In \nreviewing, confirming, establishing or modifying attendance provisions the first class school district \nboards established under the provisions of this amendatory act shall have a policy of open \nenrollment and shall enable students to attend a school of preference but providing priority \nacceptance, insofar as practicable, in cases of insufficient school capacity, to those students residing \nnearest the school and to those students desiring to attend the school for participation in vocationally \noriented courses or other specialized curriculum. \nSec. 13. If any portion of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be \nfound to be invalid by a court, such validity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of \n\nthis act which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application, and to this end this act is \ndeclared to be severable. \nSection 2. Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Act No. 244 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 388.171, \n388.172 and 388.173 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, are repealed. \nThis act is ordered to take immediate effect. \n[1] The Detroit Board of Education normally consists of seven members. At the time the complaint was filed four of the \nmembers had been recalled in an election held August 4, 1970. On August 31, 1970, the Governor appointed four new \nmembers to the vacancies created by the recall vote. \n[2] Since the statute is local in application, it is conceded by all parties that its constitutionality can be determined by a one-\njudge District Court and by this Court on appeal, and that it is not necessary to convene a three-judge District Court under \n28 U.S.C. § 2281.

No. 35257. \nUnited States District Court, E. D. Michigan, S. D. \nAugust 7, 1978. \n300*300 301*301 Louis R. Lucas, Memphis, Tenn., Thomas Atkins, Boston, Mass., for plaintiffs. \nGeorge T. Roumell, Jr., Theodore Sachs, Detroit, Mich., George L. McCargar, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., \nLansing, Mich., for defendants. \nOPINION \nDeMASCIO, District Judge. \nWe have re-examined carefully the demographic data characterizing the Detroit City Schools to \ndetermine whether further desegregation of Regions 1, 5 and 8 is possible. We undertake this task \nfollowing an appeal of our remedial guidelines to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court \nheld our August 15, 1975 remedial guidelines for desegregation \"insufficient as to Regions 1, 5 and \n8\" and remanded \"for further consideration in regard to the[se] three central regions.\" Bradley v. \nMilliken, 540 F.2d 229, 239, 240 (6th Cir. 1976). \nWhen considering all of the Regions collectively, the late Judge Stephen Roth found in 1972 that an \nadequate remedy based on pupil reassignments limited to the corporate limits of Detroit would be \nimpossible. The U.S. Supreme Court did not disturb this finding. See Bradley v. Milliken, 402 \nF.Supp. 1096, 1104 (E.D.Mich.1975). We also agreed with Judge Roth's conclusion. We stated that: \nIf Detroit's school population were more equally divided between black and white or if the \ndesegregation area were sufficiently large to permit greater equalization, it would be possible to \ndiminish the inevitable limitations on the task of eliminating racially identifiable schools in the district. \n* * * * * * \nLimitations may be imposed by the desegregation area. For example, the black proportion of the \npopulation can be so great that racial balance will inevitably result in majority black schools. In such \nan area, only two alternatives are available: The desegregation area must be enlarged or flexibility \nmust be permitted in defining a desegregated setting. 402 F.Supp. at 1102, 1131 (emphasis added). \n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed on several occasions that desegregation within the \ngeographic limitations of 302*302 Detroit is \"extremely difficult (if not impossible).\" See, e. g., Bradley \nv. Milliken, 540 F.2d 229, 236 (6th Cir. 1976). \nAs we seek to determine whether further desegregation is possible, it has become apparent that the \nlitigants have not retained the adversary posture that characterized the liability issues tried before \nJudge Roth.[1] This changing adversary posture is only natural since the Detroit Board of Education \nhas been willing to desegregate the school district without court prodding. Even before this action \nwas filed in 1971, the Detroit Board planned the first stage for dismantling the dual system existing in \nthe Detroit City Schools but was prevented from carrying it out by an act of the state legislature. In \nresponse to our April 1975 order, the Detroit Board submitted a plan for reassigning 51,000 students \nto desegregate the school district. At the hearings following the Court of Appeals remand, the Detroit \nBoard produced demographic data to establish that it had accomplished all the desegregative pupil \nreassignments possible and that additional reassignments were not feasible. In addition, the Detroit \nBoard offered extensive testimony to support a three-part plan for desegregating faculty and staff. \nThe plaintiffs are well aware that the Detroit Board of Education is striving to desegregate the school \ndistrict. The plaintiffs persist, however, in their conclusion that a school district is desegregated only \nwhen the racial composition of each school mirrors the system-wide racial ratio within 15% in either \ndirection. On the other hand, the defendant Detroit Board, charged with the primary responsibility for \nmaintaining a viable school system, insists that a sound plan for desegregation must take into \naccount the hard realities at hand. During the most recent evidentiary hearings, the plaintiffs did not \nproduce any evidence to refute the Detroit Board's contention that inclusion of Regions 1, 5 and 8 in \nthe desegregation plan is no longer feasible. The plaintiffs argued instead that the Detroit Board's \n\"contained classroom\" method of delivering bilingual instruction is resegregating Region 2 and is \nproviding neighborhood schools for one ethnic group. Tr. Sept. 7, 1977 at 211. Thus, although the \nparties continue to disagree on an acceptable formula for desegregation, they are not and cannot be \ntrue adversaries. \nMoreover, the state defendants are not in an adversary posture with either the Detroit Board of \nEducation or the plaintiffs. They did not even participate in this last round of hearings. The state \ndefendants have not really opposed the Detroit Board's efforts to desegregate; they only oppose \npaying the cost of desegregation. As a practical matter, the state's opposition to paying one half the \ncost for its own segregative acts is not always clear. After agreeing to pay 50% of the construction \ncosts for five area vocational centers, the state appealed to the Supreme Court this court's order \nrequiring them to pay for one half of the other remedial programs. At the same time, the state voices \nno opposition to this court's order requiring them to provide the budgetary requirements of the court-\ncreated Monitoring Commission and has not sought an annual review of that order. \nNo party has ever taken the initiative in the remedial phase of these proceedings. For example, \nalthough unfavorable Monitoring Commission Reports of lagging implementation of court-ordered \nremedial programs provided many opportunities for initiative, the plaintiffs have failed to take any \naction. In addition, following each appellate court mandate, it has been necessary for this court to \norder a status conference to determine how the parties intended to proceed. In each instance, the \ncourt then had to order one party or the other to proceed. Now that demographic projections predict \nthat the school district will be 87% black in 1979, the prospect that the 303*303 parties will take \nadversary initiative in future proceedings is unlikely. \nWith the Court of Appeals remand in hand, we convened a status conference on October 27, 1976, \nto determine how the parties intended to proceed. Order of October 14, 1976. Five months later, with \nno party having moved for a hearing, we sua sponteordered that hearings on the issue of faculty \nassignments begin on April 21, 1977. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to compel the Detroit Board to \n\nsubmit a further pupil reassignment plan and to adjourn the faculty assignment hearings pending \nresolution of the reassignment issue. We declined to adjourn the faculty hearings and subsequently \nordered the Detroit Board to show cause why it should not be compelled to include Regions 1, 5 and \n8 in the pupil reassignment plan. Order of April 20, 1977. The show cause hearing was subsequently \nadjourned at plaintiffs' request until September 6, 1977. The hearings on both issues have been \ncompleted and the parties have been afforded an opportunity to argue and submit proposed \nfindings, briefs, and responsive briefs. \nSUMMARY OF PRIOR PROCEEDINGS \nFour years ago, this cause was remanded by the Supreme Court for the \"prompt formulation of a \ndecree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in Detroit city schools . . .\" Milliken v. \nBradley, 418 U.S. 717, 753, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3131, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (Milliken I). Upon receipt \nof that mandate, we convened a pretrial conference to determine how the parties intended to \nproceed. We ordered the plaintiffs and the defendant Detroit Board of Education to submit plans for \ndesegregating the Detroit school district, and we afforded each of the parties an opportunity to \ncritique each of the plans submitted. Following lengthy hearings, we found both plans unacceptable. \nWe then issued guidelines for desegregation and required the Detroit Board to submit plans which \nconformed to those guidelines. \nUnder the plaintiffs' plan, any school that varied more than 15% in either direction from the system-\nwide racial ratio was a racially identifiable school in need of desegregation. We found the plaintiffs' \nplan unacceptable because it steadfastly relied upon an arbitrary ratio for defining racially identifiable \nschools. We also rejected plaintiffs' plan because it involved extensive pupil transportation that \nachieved only negligible desegregative results. Black students would be frequently transported from \none identifiably black school to another for the sole purpose of achieving a predetermined racial \nmix. 402 F.Supp. at 1122-25. The Court of Appeals also declined to implement plaintiffs' plan. 540 \nF.2d at 239. \nWe found that the Detroit Board's plan also impermissibly sought to achieve rigid racial ratios in each \nschool. The Detroit Board believed that schools that were 40-60% black (50-50% plus or minus \n10%) were less susceptible to demographic change. We rejected the Board's plan because it paired \nschools located in naturally integrated neighborhoods and transported white or black children for the \nsole purpose of accommodating a racial pattern. We agreed with the Detroit Board, however, that an \nacceptable desegregation plan within the meaning of Milliken I required the elimination of racially \nidentifiable white schools in the City of Detroit. We reasoned: \n[T]he evil of segregation lies in the devastating psychological impact upon black children of the \nknowledge that they are being excluded from white schools. . . . However, when blacks are \nrepresented in all schools throughout the system, i. e., when white identifiable schools are \neliminated, this psychological effect no longer exists. 402 F.Supp. at 1132. \nWe also concluded, as had the defendant Detroit Board, that Regions 1, 5 and 8 could not be \nincluded in the pupil reassignment plan because to do so would preclude meaningful interaction \nbetween black and white students in the other regions, reasoning: \n304*304 Plaintiffs refuse to acknowledge that the racial composition of these three regions precludes \ntheir inclusion in a desegregation plan. In Region V, for example, there are 31,354 students of whom \n(excluding the Spanish surnamed) only 989 (3.1%) are white. In Region VIII, there are 29,725 \nstudents of whom (excluding Spanish surnamed) only 1,329 (4.5%) are white. In Region I, there are \n24,907 students of whom (excluding Spanish surnamed) only 2,049 (8.2%) are white. Clearly, it \n\nwould be futile to attempt desegregation within the boundaries of these regions; thus, a \ndesegregation plan including these three regions would have to cross regional boundaries. But to \ninclude these regions in the Board's plan would bring about the same result that pertains after \napplication of the plaintiffs' own plan. The plaintiffs' plan itself is sufficient proof that any attempt to \ninclude these regions produces only negligible results. Application of plaintiffs' plan \"would make the \nDetroit school system more identifiably Black, and leave many of its schools 75 to 90 per cent Black. \n(Findings of Fact—March 28, 1972, 484 F.2d 215, 243-44 (1973.)) \nThat inclusion of these three regions in a desegregation plan would produce only negligible \ndesegregative results is inevitable because even excluding Regions I, V and VIII there are only \n63,446 white students as compared to 103,007 black students. To attempt to disperse those white \nstudents throughout the eight regions, including the three overwhelmingly black regions, would \nproduce such negligible desegregative benefits that the extraordinary remedy of such cross-regional \nbussing would be unwarranted. To do so would only serve to lessen the little community control \nblacks now enjoy in those regions and, therefore, injure the very class the remedy is intended to \nbenefit. In the face of these \"practicalities\" there is no constitutional objection to leaving a number of \none-race or predominantly one-race schools. 402 F.Supp. at 1129(footnotes and citations omitted) \n(emphasis added). \nThe Court of Appeals, although \"recognizing the absence of alternatives,\" disapproved our exclusion \nof Regions 1, 5, and 8 and affirmed the pupil reassignment plan with respect to the remaining \nregions. The court characterized our finding of futility as \"perfunctory treatment\" holding that we \"did \nnot subject the exclusion of these three regions to the close scrutiny required by Swann [Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554].\" 540 F.2d at \n238. The court held that the record did not support the conclusion that the school board carried the \nheavy burden of justifying the one race schools located in these regions, and that it appeared we \nimpermissibly considered these three regions in isolation. What neither the record before the Court \nof Appeals, nor this court's prior opinions revealed was the painstaking care with which the court \nattempted, with the assistance of its court-appointed experts, to devise a plan that would provide \nmeaningful pupil reassignments in these regions. Three subsequent submissions by the Detroit \nBoard were thoroughly examined, and we subsequently approved with modifications a Detroit Board \nplan which conformed to our guidelines. Bradley v. Milliken, 411 F.Supp. 943, 944 (E.D. Mich.1975). \nGiven the small number of white students in the school district, we found it impossible to devise a \nplan which could bring meaningful pupil reassignments in each and every region. The Court of \nAppeals shared the same frustration that this court experienced in attempting to reassign students \nwithin these regions. The court stated: \nWe recognize that it would be appropriate for us at this point to supply guidelines to the District \nJudge as to what he should do under this remand. Omission of such guidelines is not based on any \nfailure to consider the problem in depth. It is based upon the conviction which this court had at the \ntime of its en banc opinion in this case . . . that genuine constitutional desegregation can not be \naccomplished within the school district boundaries of the Detroit School District. 540 F.2d at 240. \n305*305 Our guidelines for desegregation had provided that schools should not have a black student \npopulation less than 30%, and we treated as desegregated a school whose student body was \nbetween 30% and 55% black. In order to preserve naturally integrated neighborhoods, we \ndetermined that schools already within these parameters should not be subjected to student \nreassignments. We required that all other available methods of pupil reassignments be exhausted \nprior to relying upon transportation. We further provided that the Detroit Board should achieve a \nracial mix of 50%-50% in zoned middle schools and should create open enrollment middle schools \nsimilar to the magnet middle schools then in existence, which would be acceptable when 55-70% \nblack. 402 F.Supp. at 1134-38. We also ordered remedial programs which were designed to \nalleviate the effects of defendants' prior acts of segregation. 402 F.Supp. at 1118. These educational \n\ncomponents were affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 542 F.2d at 241-42, and by the Supreme \nCourt, 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Milliken II). \nFinally, incidental to and concurrent with the implementation of our guidelines, we ordered that \nteachers in the Detroit school system be reassigned to achieve a distribution of not more than 70% \nof teachers of one race in each school. Order of August 28, 1975. The events leading to the entry of \nthis order have been detailed elsewhere. Bradley v. Milliken, 426 F.Supp. 929, 940 (E.D.Mich.1977). \nThe Court of Appeals vacated that order but agreed that a district court has equitable power to order \nthe reassignment of faculty despite Judge Roth's prior finding that there had been no de \njure segregation in faculty assignments by either the Detroit Board or the state defendants. 540 F.2d \nat 246-47. Our guidelines had acknowledged that there were other criteria for measuring a unitary \nsystem in addition to pupil assignments, such as faculty assignments, staff assignments, \nextracurricular activities, and equality of facilities. 402 F.Supp. at 1133. \nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1. Pupil Reassignments \nThe population shift from white to black in the district has accelerated well beyond our 1975 \ndemographic projections. See 402 F.Supp. at 1137; see also 338 F.Supp. at 585. The official \nOctober 1976 count for the school district disclosed that it was 79.4% black. Tr. Sept. 6, 1977 at 10. \nBy the end of the 1978-79 school year, the school district will be 87.0% black. Furthermore, the \ndefendant Detroit Board has produced evidence, which we fully credit, that this school district will be \n89.6% black by 1980 and 91.8% black by 1981. BX-C.[2] \nThe Detroit Board's chief demographer, Mr. Henrickson, prepared worksheets that depict the grade-\nto-grade survival method he utilized to arrive at the projections contained in BX-C. See BX-D. Mr. \nHenrickson obtained the actual number of births for the year 1966 as recorded by the Board of \nHealth, corrected to Detroit residency. He then tracked the actual number of children, black and \nwhite, who appeared in kindergarten five years later and then followed that group of children as they \nprogressed from grade to grade in their schools from 1971 through 1976. Tr. at 11-23; BX-D. Those \ncomputations establish that the grade retention rate for black students is much higher than for white \nstudents. For example, 97.9% of the black students entering kindergarten in 1971 remained in the \nschool system through the sixth grade while only 78% of the white students remained. Mr. \nHenrickson testified that he used those retention rate percentages to project the composition of the \nstudent body through 1981 based on the trends that he observed for the period 1971-1976. Tr. at \n11-12.[3] He did this for each grade individually, repeating the process for black and white students \nseparately. Tr. at 13-17. \n306*306 We find Mr. Henrickson's method of projection logical and reliably accurate. He testified that \nin his experience he has been able to predict future enrollment within 100 to 200 students. Tr. at 18. \nThis is a standard procedure used in many school districts and one which he has used in the regular \ncourse of his employment to forecast future needs of the school system. Tr. at 31. \nMr. Henrickson further testified that in each year since 1971, approximately 10,000 fewer students \nhave enrolled in the Detroit school system. Tr. at 24.[4] This downward trend is due principally to a \nreduction in the number of white students, and is expected to continue for at least the next five \nyears. Tr. at 30.[5] The decline in the number of white students is attributable to the declining white \nbirth rate, and in part to white parents who take their children out of the Detroit school system. Tr. at \n22-24. During this period of decreasing enrollment, the total number of black students in the system \nhas remained reasonably constant. Tr. at 24.[6] Considering the declining birth rate, together with the \n\ndeclining retention rate for white students, Mr. Henrickson projects the racial composition in future \nyears as follows: \n     YEAR   TOTAL ENROLLMENT   NUMBER/% BLACK   NUMBER/% WHITE \n \n     1978         218,110          184,230          33,880 \n                                    84.5%            15.5% \n     1979         208,610          181,550          27,060 \n                                    87%              13% \n     1980         198,000          177,330          20,670 \n                                    89.6%            10.4% \n     1981         188,170          172,820          15,350 \n                                    91.8%             8.2% \nThus, we are confident that Detroit will have a school system that is 91.8% black in 1981. This trend \nis independent of student assignments, and any changes that might be made in the pupil \nreassignment plan will neither accelerate nor decelerate the downward trend. Tr. at 26, 30. \nIn addition, pronounced demographic shifts are occurring throughout the entire city. Detroit Board \nExhibits H, I and J clearly depict the constant and increasing influx of black students into every \nregion.[7] These exhibits are maps which divide the city into elementary school attendance areas and \nshow the racial composition of students by residence in each school area for the years 1974, 1975 \nand February 1977. In 1974, there were 60 school attendance areas which were less than 30% \nblack and 10 which were 30-55% black. BX-H. In 1975 there were 57 school attendance areas less \nthan 30% black and 9 that were 30-55% black. BX-I. In February 1977, the number of school \nattendance areas that were less than 30% black declined to 39 while the number between 30-55% \ndoubled. BX-J. Thus, in a brief three-year period, there were 21 fewer school attendance areas that \nwere under 30% black, and 13 fewer school attendance areas less than 55% black. Many of the \nschool attendance areas that remain under 30% black continue to integrate and steadily approach \nthat percentage: \n307*307 \n  SCHOOL AREA   1974 % BLACK   1977 % BLACK \n \n  Burgess             4%            24.7% \n  Lodge               0%             8.1% \n  Houghten            4%            11.4% \n  Healey              0%            15.0% \n  Gompers             0%             6.4% \n  McLean              2%            16.4% \n  Pulaski             2%            16.0% \n  Columbus            2%            14.6% \n  Wilkens             6%            14.0% \n  Marquette           6%            14.1% \n  Hanstien            0%             8.0% \nBX-H & J. \nThese changing residential patterns are occurring principally in schools that border the outer limits of \nthe city, east and west. In just two years, many of those schools reflect black enrollment that is 30-\n55% and over: \n  SCHOOL AREA   1975 % BLACK   1977 % BLACK \n \n\n  Holcomb            15.0%          35.2% \n  Burt               17.0%          37.0% \n  Harding            29.0%          35.2% \n  Vetal              25.0%          45.9% \n  Mann               27.0%          52.8% \n  McCall              8.0%          33.0% \n  Wayne               9.0%          33.3% \n  Stellwagon         15.0%          43.5% \n  Clark              11.0%          35.8% \n  Emerson            62.0%          73.1% \n  Cooke              38.0%          57.8% \nBX-I & J; Tr. at 48-50. \nThus, the outer regions of the city are experiencing a steady increase in residential black population \nand a steady decline in white population. Mr. Henrickson concluded that this is the result of black \nfamilies moving from Regions 1, 5, and 8 into regions further out from the center of the city. Tr. at 37; \nBX-E. He discounted the possibility that the increase in black enrollment could result from black \nfamilies taking their children out of private schools and enrolling them in public schools. He based \nthis opinion on his own experience and knowledge that few black families transfer from private to \npublic schools, and on discussions with regional superintendents. Tr. at 42-43. We find that Mr. \nHenrickson has fully documented his judgment on this point. When this changing residential pattern \nis taken together with our reassignment plan, the result is that out of approximately 185 elementary \nschools, 141 are at least 55% black, 37 are 30-55% black and only 7 are less than 30% black. Tr. at \n50; BX-K.[8] \nWe conclude that as a result of the present racial ratios in the vast majority of the schools, the \npredominance of black students in the school district and the accelerated population shifts, no more \ndesegregation is feasible in Regions 1, 5 and 8 collectively. These pronounced demographic shifts, \nfirst predicted by Judge Roth,[9] and the predominance of the black student population have \nobliterated the optional and gerrymandered attendance zones which permitted white students to \navoid attending integrated schools, the practice of bussing black students from overcrowded schools \nbeyond a closer white school and the practice of altering feeder patterns in racially changing \nneighborhoods. The Supreme Court in Milliken I was unable to find from the evidence in the record \nbelow that these de jure acts of segregation found by Judge Roth had a segregative effect beyond \nthe boundaries of the Detroit City Schools. This was so because the actions which formed the basis \nfor Judge Roth's liability findings were basically reactions by the Detroit Board of Education to \nchanging residential patterns. The optional and gerrymandered attendance zones served the \npurpose of keeping white students out of 308*308 schools that, in the absence of such policies, \nwould have become, and in fact have become, integrated naturally. Judge Roth did not find, \nhowever, that these policies in turn created additional residential segregation which in turn created \nadditional school segregation. Had he made such findings, and had such findings been supported in \nthe record, we assume the Supreme Court would have affirmed the propriety of an interdistrict \nremedy. \nThe demographic data presented by the Detroit Board compels us to further conclude that it is the \ndemographic residential patterns, operating independently of school assignments, together with the \npredominance of blacks in the school system, and not the segregative acts of the Detroit Board and \nthe state that have resulted in the one race schools that remain in Regions 1, 5 and 8. Although a \nschool district that retains one race schools bears a heavy burden to satisfy the court that their \ncomposition is not the result of present or past discriminatory action, Swann v. Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971), that burden is satisfied by the \nDetroit Board's showing that such schools are the result of population shifts, or the predominance of \n\nblack school children in the district as a whole, or both. See Calhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th \nCir.), rehearing denied 525 F.2d 1203 (5th Cir. 1975); Hobson v. Hansen, 327 F.Supp. 844 \n(D.D.C.1971); Tasby v. Estes, 412 F.Supp. 1192 (N.D.Texas 1975); United States v. Choctaw \nCounty Board of Education, 339 F.Supp. 901 (S.D.Ala.1971); Carr v. Montgomery County Board of \nEducation, 377 F.Supp. 1123 (M.D.Ala.1974), aff'd, 511 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 423 U.S. \n986, 96 S.Ct. 394, 46 L.Ed.2d 303 (1975). A school-by-school examination of student enrollment by \nresidence and as affected by student assignment make it apparent that the school district no longer \ndiscriminates against black students. That examination discloses that the schools are increasing \nblack enrollment through natural influxes of black families into the changing neighborhoods. The \nDetroit Board's desegregation plan brought schools within the parameters of our guidelines, and its \npresent assignment pattern is free from the vestiges of prior discrimination. While there may be a \npresumption of system-wide impact of segregative policies, Keyes v. Denver School District No. \n1, 521 F.2d 465 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1066, 96 S.Ct. 806, 46 L.Ed.2d 657 \n(1976), we find that the Detroit Board has overcome such presumption and established conclusively \nthat the existence of one race schools is not the product of their past or present discriminatory acts. \nIn Calhoun, the court was required to determine the amount of desegregation possible in the Atlanta \nSchool District, which had become 85% black. The district court had approved a plan which \nachieved 30% black enrollment in every school and which left 92 of 148 schools at least 90% black. \nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that an 85% black student enrollment would \ninevitably leave a number of one race schools: \nThe district court also found that Atlanta's remaining one-race schools are the product of its \npreponderant majority of black pupils rather than a vestige of past segregation. These findings are \nnot clearly erroneous. The aim of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection on \nwhich this litigation is based is to assure that state supported educational opportunity is afforded \nwithout regard to race; it is not to achieve racial integration in public schools. 522 F.2d at 719. \nThe court also affirmed the district court's findings that the Atlanta School Board no longer \ndiscriminated against black students, that its assignment pattern was free from the vestiges of prior \ndiscrimination and that its large number of identifiably black schools was the product of demographic \nfactors. The court elaborated in its denial of a rehearing: \nIt would blink reality and authority, however, to hold the Atlanta School System to be nonunitary \nbecause further racial integration is theoretically possible and we expressly decline to do so. 525 \nF.2d at 1203. \n309*309 Similarly, in Tasby v. Estes, 412 F.Supp. 1192 (N.D.Texas 1975), the court, in devising a \nremedy for the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) which was 41.1% white, 44.5% black and \n13.4% Mexican-American, refused to disturb schools which had become naturally integrated through \nresidential patterns. 412 F.Supp. at 1206. The court, after considering the geographic characteristics \nof the district and the small number of white students remaining, approved a plan which did not \ndisturb the South Oak Cliffs, an area of the DISD which had become 98% black. The court \nemphasized that its ruling did not deny the students of South Oak Cliffs a remedy, finding that its \nsuperior facilities would make it a model for the district. 412 F.Supp. at 1204. See Hobson v. \nHansen, 269 F.Supp. 401, 515 (D.D.C.1967) (refusing to disturb assignment patterns because of the \nten to one ratio of black to white children and granting instead additional relief which dealt with \nequalizing the equality of education in the district). \nIn Brunson v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 1, 429 F.2d 820 (4th Cir. 1970),the court \naffirmed the district judge's order implementing a desegregation plan developed by the Department \nof Health, Education and Welfare. That plan provided for disbursing white students among the \n\nschools so that each school had a white population between 5 and 17% in a school district which \ncontained 2,408 black students and 256 white students. In a separate opinion, three judges criticized \nthe HEW plan as one which \"threatens to swallow up, rather than vindicate, the constitutional \nmandate for integrated schools in Clarendon District No. 1.\" 429 F.2d at 822 (Craven, Cir. J., \nconcurring and dissenting). Judge Sobeloff concurring in the judgment, disagreed with the dissenting \nopinion. He found the fear of white flight irrelevant and criticized the theory of the dissent that \nmajority white schools provide an optimum racial mix. That theory was premised on an assumption \nof white superiority which he found unacceptable in fact or law. 429 F.2d at 823-27 (Sobeloff, Cir. J., \nconcurring). \nWe agree with Judge Sobeloff's criticism of the Brunson dissent and note that Judge Craven later \nacknowledged doubts about the validity of the approach of his dissent. Bradley v. School Board of \nCity of Richmond, Virginia, 462 F.2d 1058, 1063 n.5 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 239, \n34 L.Ed.2d 171 (1973). We also agree with one basic premise of Brunson; the mere scattering of a \nfew remaining white students does not provide a remedy consistent with the fourteenth amendment \nas interpreted in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). This \nwas also the conclusion of the court in the two cases which most closely approximate the \ndemographic data in this district, the school districts for Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, Georgia. The \nCourt of Appeals has recognized this to be so in Detroit as well, in that it rejected the alternative of \nreassigning the remaining white students \"among the predominantly black schools on a percentage \nbasis somewhat along the lines originally proposed by plaintiffs. It is obvious that such a requirement \nwould accomplish nothing more than token integration, and that of uncertain duration.\" Bradley v. \nMilliken, 540 F.2d 229, 239 (6th Cir. 1976). \nWe therefore adhere to our prior conclusion that a school system cannot be desegregated by \nmaking all schools racially identifiably black. This result inevitably occurs when further desegregation \nis attempted for Regions 1, 5 and 8 collectively. When racial proportions are so extreme that \nadequate interaction between children of both races cannot be accomplished, further desegregation \nis not possible and it is unwise to disturb assignment patterns which effectively desegregate the \nschools in other regions. Moreover, in a school district which has become increasingly black while \nundergoing a dramatic decline in white student enrollment, it is very important that naturally \nintegrated neighborhoods not be disturbed. Judge Wright recognized this in the District of Columbia. \nIndeed, our own efforts to preserve the few remaining racially stable school attendance areas in \nDetroit received favorable comment by the Supreme Court: \n310*310 [T]he District Judge took great pains to devise a workable plan with a minimum of pupil \ntransportation. For example, he sought carefully to eliminate burdensome transportation of Negro \nchildren to predominant Negro schools and to prevent the disruption, by massive pupil \nreassignment, of racially mixed schools in stable neighborhoods which had successfully undergone \nresidential and educational change. Milliken II, 433 U.S. at 288 n.19, 97 S.Ct. at 2761. \nPerhaps, the most graphic evidence that Regions 1, 5 and 8, treated collectively, cannot be further \ndesegregated is the insignificant number of white students in the city available for that purpose. To \nestablish a pool of white students available to further desegregate Regions 1, 5 and 8, the defendant \nDetroit Board submitted an exhibit which summarizes, from the data contained in the 1977 fourth \nFriday count, the number of schools which are less than 50% black. See BX-O. We agree with the \nDetroit Board that this is the relevant starting point in determining whether additional pupil \nreassignments can occur in Regions 1, 5 and 8. We have already accepted as desegregated any \nschool 30-55% black and further held that a school 55% or more black is a racially identifiable \nschool. See 402 F.Supp. at 1134-35. We deemed that guideline essential to effectively utilize the \nwhite children then available to achieve the racial ratios now existing in schools throughout the \ncity. See p. 307, supra. To use a significantly higher figure than the 50% suggested by the Detroit \nBoard would cause all the schools to become identifiably black, a suggestion we have repeatedly \n\nrejected. Moreover, a greater or lesser percentage starting point would materially disturb present \nassignment patterns and tend to increase the number of black children being bussed from one \nidentifiably black school to another. As we stated previously, and the Sixth Circuit and Supreme \nCourt agreed, it casts a heavy burden on black students to bus them great distances to attend \nanother majority black school. See 402 F.Supp. 1125. \nBX-O shows that there are 31 elementary schools in the district which are less than 50% black. \nThese schools contain a total of 7,860 non-black students and 4,463 black students. BX-1 attached \nto Board findings. In order to assure that these schools remain desegregated, we could only \nreassign the excess of non-black students over black students, or 3,397. The 1977 fourth Friday \ncount, however, shows that there are 38,259 black students in the elementary schools in Regions 1, \n5 and 8, or 11 times the number of non-black students available to be reassigned among them. BX-\nO; Tr. at 55-64; BX-2 attached to Board proposed findings. Thus, the evidence establishes that most \nof the white children in the school district are being utilized in the present reassignment plan for \nschools which are at least 55% black, and an insignificant number of white students remain to \nmeaningfully desegregate Regions 1, 5 and 8. To disperse these few available white children among \nthe schools in those regions would accomplish nothing more than token integration and transport \nblack children to other majority black schools. \nThe situation in the middle schools is no different. There are six schools less than 50% black \ncontaining 2,305 non-black and 1,572 black students.[10] The difference, or only 733 non-black \nstudents, is all that is available to integrate the middle schools in Regions 1, 5 and 8, or fewer than \nthe number of black students in 10 of the 21 middle schools in those three regions. The 21 schools \nhave a combined black student population of 17,015 or 23 times the number of available non-black \nstudents. This predominance of black students is even more pronounced at the high school level. \nThe only high school that is not over 50% black is Western High School in Region 2, which has \n1,069 non-black and 894 black students. This provides a pool of 175 students to integrate the high \nschools in Regions 1, 5 and 8 which have a total of 17,783 black students, approximately 100 times \nthe number of available non-black students. Assuming 311*311 the Detroit Board transferred all 175 \nstudents to Northeastern High School, the school with the smallest black population, and assigned \nan equal number of students from Northeastern to Western, Northeastern would have a student \npopulation of 1,210 black and 244 non-black. The maximum desegregation possible at the high \nschool level in Regions 1, 5 and 8 would yield a high school 83.2% black, still racially identifiably \nblack. \nHaving concluded that no further desegregation is possible in Regions 1, 5 and 8 collectively, we \nnow examine all regions separately. In doing so, we note that the demographic patterns which we \nhave described above fairly characterize every region in the district except Region 2. Black student \nenrollment in Region 2 has remained virtually unchanged, increasing from 60 to only 62% from 1974 \nto 1977. The residential trends there greatly differ from every other region. Virtually every school \nattendance area of Region 2 that was less than 30% black in resident student population in 1974 \nhas remained unchanged, and, unlike the other regions, has not integrated naturally. The most \nextreme examples are the Higgins, Bennett, Harms, Beard, Neinas, McKinstry and Logan school \nattendance areas. The largest black resident population is at Logan where it was only 3.6% in \nFebruary 1977, a decrease from 9%. The most extreme example is at Hunter, which was 34% black \nin 1974 but 1.2% black as of February 1977. BX-H, I and J. Moreover, 5 of the 6 majority white \nmiddle schools that exist in the city are located in Region 2. Western High School, located in Region \n2, has a lower black enrollment than any other high school in the city.[11] \nThus, the residential patterns which are conspicuous in every other region are simply not occurring \nin Region 2. The impact of this demography on the racial composition of the schools is substantial \nand can clearly be seen when the analysis offered by the Detroit Board to prove that it is impossible \nto desegregate the schools of Regions 1, 5 and 8 by pupil reassignment is applied. There are \n\nfourteen (14) elementary schools in Region 2 which are less than 50% black. These schools contain \nthe following numbers of students: \n                REGION 2 \n \n  SCHOOL    NON-BLACK    BLACK \n \nBeard          391        133 \nBennett        444        189 \nHarms          329        152 \nHiggins        354        210 \nHolmes         280        190 \nHunter          23          0 \nJefferies      379        208 \nLogan          357        192 \nMaybury        379        166 \nMcKinstry      252        160 \nNeinas         366        233 \nMcMillan       258        114 \nPriest         613        505 \nWebster        465        293 \n               ___        ___ \n             4,890      2,745 \nIn these schools above, there are 2,145 more non-black than black students. To this may be added \nthe excess white student population of Burton and Franklin Schools in Region 1 yielding a total of \n2,459 more white students than black.[12] Exchanging students between the majority white schools in \nRegions 1 and 2 and the predominantly black schools in Region 1 would produce an elementary \nschool population in Region 1 of 5,091 black and 3,248 white, or 61.1% black. Of course, we are not \nsuggesting that this one-for-one exchange is feasible, or should be undertaken. We have already \nheld that all pupil reassignments must be considered in the light of the practicalities of the situation. \nThis mathematical exercise, however, does demonstrate that the numbers alone do not pose an \nobstacle to further desegregation of Region 1 using students from Region 2. \n312*312 The Detroit Board contends that most of these non-black students in Region 2 are not \navailable for transfer, because they are Spanish-speaking students involved in bilingual-bicultural \nprograms in their schools.[13] There is a large number of Spanish-surnamed students residing in \nRegion 2, and the Detroit Board argues that it cannot control where Spanish-speaking persons \nchoose to live. That may well be. As plaintiffs contend, however, restricting bilingual programs to one \nregion provides Spanish families with neighborhood schools not available to other Detroit children, \nand is an added inducement for them to move there. We cannot approve this wholesale exclusion of \nSpanish-speaking students from the pupil reassignment remedy. This case began as and remains a \nracial desegregation case, and for school assignment purposes Spanish-surnamed students cannot \nbe treated differently than other white students. Bilingual education is not a justification for treating \none ethnic group in isolation nor is it a substitute for desegregation. Keyes v. Denver School District \nNo. 1, 521 F.2d 465, 480 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1066, 96 S.Ct. 806, 46 L.Ed.2d 657 \n(1976). \nIn a supplemental brief, the Detroit Board contends that its bilingual-bicultural program has not \nresegregated the schools in Region 2. We cannot agree. The influx of black families into Region 2 \ncannot occur naturally when bilingual programs for Spanish-surnamed persons are confined to one \nregion.[14] The Detroit Board has produced testimony to the effect that adjustment will be made to the \nnumber of students transported to the schools we have singled out in Region 2, so that all schools \nwill reflect at least 30% black student enrollment. Tr. at 51. This argument, however, misses one \n\ncrucial point. The Court of Appeals remanded this cause with instructions that we re-examine the \nissue of pupil reassignments in Regions 1, 5 and 8. The bilingual-bicultural program cannot provide \nwholesale justification for excluding Spanish surnamed students along with other white students \nfrom reassignments which may further desegregate Regions 1, 5, or 8. Bilingual programs, although \nessential, must be subordinated to a desegregation plan. Keyes, 521 F.2d at 480. The evidence, on \nthe whole, compels us to conclude that the Detroit Board has not shown cause why there should not \nbe additional pupil reassignments in Region 1, using students from Region 2. \n2. Faculty Assignments \nOur August 15, 1975, guidelines recognized that desegregation of faculty and staff was an essential \nindicia for measuring a unitary school system. 402 F.Supp. at 1133. We believed, however, that \"it \nwould be inappropriate for this court to order any reassignment of faculty at this time\" because those \nchanges should await the court's assessment of the effects of pupil reassignments and changed \ngrade structures on faculty assignments.[15] Thus, we directed \"the Detroit Board and the Detroit \nFederation of Teachers [to] begin negotiations concerning reassignments necessitated by other \ncomponents of this plan.\" 402 F.Supp. at 1144. Thereafter, the Detroit Board and the DFT stipulated \nto the entry of an order, which achieved \"a distribution of not more than 70% of teachers of one race \nin each school.\" Order of August 28, 1975. We must now determine whether this assignment pattern \nadequately desegregates faculty and staff in this school district. \nThe plaintiffs argue that the court must go further than the present order provides. 313*313They \ncontend that the Detroit school system \"still shows patterns of racial identifiability that have never \nbeen fully dismantled,\" that the school system should achieve a distribution of teachers by race that \nreflects, where possible, the system-wide racial ratios at each grade level, and that variances should \nnot be greater than that required to accommodate specialization of teaching functions. Tr. April 24, \n1977 at 6, 13-14. To support these contentions, the plaintiffs called as a witness Dr. Robert Green, \nDean of the College of Urban Development at Michigan State University. Dr. Green defined racial \nidentifiability: \nA school can be viewed as being racially identifiable when any set of selective personnel that \nservices that school, be they teachers or pupils, when their numbers in that particular school departs \nsignificantly, or unusually from their representation in that system on a system wide basis. That's the \nkind of a general rule of thumb that can be used. Tr. of April 29, 1977, at 543. \nDoctor Green testified that the racial identifiability of the faculty has a significant educational impact \nupon students, that teachers serve as adult role models for students and hence it is important that \nchildren have teachers of both races, and that students whose environment is racially isolated will \ngrow up with narrow, restricted views of the world. Tr. at 535-36.[16] He later explained that racial \nidentifiability of a school is readily perceived by the community, parents and students attending that \nschool, that a student's perception of the composition of a school's faculty as identifiably black or \nwhite affects a child's motivation to achieve, affects the general performance and conduct of black \nstudents, and finally causes black students to have a lower perception of themselves, inhibiting their \neducational achievement. Tr. at 1384-85, 1390-94. It is his view that students perceive majority white \nschools with a majority white faculty as academically superior. Tr. at 1390. Although their \nperceptions are not statistically accurate, students are, according to Dr. Green, generally aware of \nthe racial composition of a school system. Tr. at 580. He concluded that students would perceive \nany school with a faculty which departs radically from the system wide racial ratios as one that has \nbeen given special consideration for racial reasons. Tr. at 1387. \n\nThe defendant Detroit Board called as its expert Mr. Fred Martin, Executive Director of Personnel for \nthe Detroit School System.[17] He testified that students viewed teachers as role models and \nemphasized that in a system undergoing desegregation it is desirable that students have \nexperiences with teachers of all races. Tr. at 284, 1028-33. Mr. Martin also believed that student \nperceptions are important; but unlike Dr. Green, Mr. Martin was concerned with the opportunities \nafforded students to interact with teachers of different races. Tr. at 1163-64. Thus, at the elementary \nschool level, Mr. Martin would not only strive to achieve a faculty that reflected the racial distribution \nin the system as a whole, but he would also seek to insure individual student contact with teachers \nof both races. Tr. at 1175. In commenting upon the Detroit Board's proposal to replace four black \nteachers with four white teachers at Central High School, he conceded that changing Central from \n64.4% black to 60.4% black was not significant in terms of percentage change, but he viewed the \naddition of four white teachers who have contact with 140 314*314 students as significantly \ncontributing to the desegregative experience of those students. Tr. at 1460-61, 1469. When the \nsystem-wide faculty approached 70% of one race, Mr. Martin would then inquire into the reasons \nbehind that racial composition and seek to change hiring policies to reverse the trend. Tr. at 755-56. \nDr. Green, on the other hand, would strive to achieve faculty assignments that mirror the system-\nwide racial composition regardless of what that racial proportion may be. \nThe Detroit Federation of Teachers (DFT) called as its expert witness, Dr. John Simpkins, Dean of \nthe College of Education at Wayne State University and an eminently qualified educator. Dr. \nSimpkins also agrees that teachers serve as role models for students and that it is educationally \ndesirable that students have teachers of both races. Tr. at 1666-70. Dr. Simpkins does not agree, \nhowever, that teacher assignments must reflect the system-wide racial composition. He testified that \nit is desirable to integrate faculty only to the extent necessary to avoid the appearance of what he \ntermed tokenism, and that token integration, such as one white teacher in a school with ten black \nteachers, should be avoided because it places disproportionate pressure on the single white \nteacher. Tr. at 1677. Therefore, Dr. Simpkins would approve the present faculty distribution \naccomplished by our August 28, 1975 order. He testified that a faculty is sufficiently desegregated \nwhen a student has one chance in three to interact with a teacher of both races, and that additional \nreassignments would serve only to improve faculty statistics without necessarily having a beneficial \neffect upon students. Tr. at 1662-63, 1683. \nDr. Simpkins clearly understands the importance of insuring student contact with teachers of both \nraces to eliminate the effects of prior state imposed racial isolation. Commenting upon the need for \nblack students to interact with black teachers, he said: \n[Y]oungsters need to believe that they can be whatever they aspire to be. And this belief is \nreinforced when they see people who look like them, who are, in fact, doing those things . . . Tr. at \n1667. \nHe testified that it was important that students interact with black and white teachers because it \nenhances their concept of equality, and because it is important that black students see white people \nin a humanitarian role. Tr. at 1668-69. \nWe agree with these expert witnesses that students view teachers as role models, and therefore, it \nis educationally desirable that students interact with teachers of both races. We do not agree, \nhowever, with Dr. Green's theory of racial identifiability as it pertains to a school system such as \nDetroit. He is unduly concerned that a student attending a school with a faculty which departs \nsignificantly from the system-wide racial composition would perceive that school as one that has \nbeen afforded special treatment, and would have the impression that other schools in the system \nhave been treated similarly. Tr. at 1565-66. The most serious objection we have to Dr. Green's \ntheory is that it treats the racial mix of a faculty in the Detroit City Schools in a vacuum. We cannot \n\naccept the suggestion that a student's perception of racial identifiability of his or her school faculty is \nlimited to the school district's boundaries. A student attending a school on the far east side of Detroit \nis more likely to compare his school to closer schools in adjacent suburbs rather than to schools in \nthe far northwest section of the city. Dr. Green's testimony is also of doubtful assistance to the court \nbecause it was based on the incorrect assumption that the court had found the faculty of schools in \nthe district de juresegregated. Tr. at 1424, 1428, 1440.[18] We reject the rigid concept that students \nwould receive a desegregated experience in a school with a 90% black faculty 315*315 simply \nbecause the faculty was 90% black system wide. A faculty is desegregated fully only when there is \nadequate opportunity for students to interact with teachers of both races and teacher assignments \nare made on a racially neutral basis. \nNeither can we fully accept the conclusions of Dr. Simpkins. Although he agreed that the present 70-\n30 ratio created a high probability that a student would not have contact with teachers of both races, \nhe nevertheless accepted the current faculty as desegregated, despite his acknowledgement of the \nneed for interaction between students and faculty of both races. Tr. at 1676-78. In support of his \nposition, Dr. Simpkins admitted that he assumed the Detroit district was moving toward a 50-50 \nfaculty distribution in each school, and that his conclusions might well have been different had there \nnot already been one large scale teacher reassignment. Tr. at 1881-83. Dr. Simpkins was overly \nconcerned that additional teacher transfers would detrimentally impact the stability of the schools by \ndisrupting other essential faculty characteristics such as sex and age. His analysis failed to place \nsufficient weight on the need to afford Detroit school children a complete desegregative educational \nexperience. Although the current faculty distribution does provide something more than token \nintegration, Detroit students should, if at all feasible, receive more than a remedy that provides only \nminimal desegregation. This is particularly important in a district where the students have been \nracially isolated for years. \nDr. Simpkins conceded that the faculty distribution in Regions 1, 5 and 8 left something to be \ndesired. Tr. at 1677. In fact, it appears that faculty reassignments in those regions were not made on \na completely racially neutral basis, despite our order of August 28, 1975. Schools which had a \nsubstantial white student enrollment retained a predominantly white faculty, while schools with a \npredominantly black student enrollment have predominantly black faculties. Tr. at 2005-2019; DX-\n3A, 6 and 11. Thus, Regions 1, 5 and 8, which have an overwhelmingly black student enrollment, \nhave faculty ratios that approximate 70% black, while in Region 7, more than half the schools have \nfaculty ratios that are close to 70% white. Indeed, in Region 7, the percentage of schools with a \nmajority white faculty increased from 72% to 88% between 1974 and 1976. Tr. at 139, 672-73. \nSimilarly, in Region 8, the percentage of schools with a majority black faculty increased from 76% to \n85% between 1975 and 1977. We cannot agree that this distribution of faculty by race provides \nadequate interaction between students and teachers of both races. \nBecause it is the Detroit Board's primary obligation to desegregate, we have examined carefully its \nplan to desegregate faculty and staff. That plan requires implementation in three distinct stages. To \nimplement the first stage the Detroit Board has requested the court to reinstate the August 28, 1975, \norder. The second phase of the Board's plan adopts the HEW regulation which requires that faculty \nassignments be made so that the proportion of full-time minority classroom teachers at each school \nis between 75% and 125% of the proportion of such minority teachers existing on the faculty as a \nwhole. Since the current faculty is 52.8% black, each school in the district would have a faculty \nbetween 39% and 65% black. The third and final stage of the Detroit Board's plan is quite unique in \nthat no immediate faculty transfers are anticipated. Instead, the Detroit Board would be authorized \nby court order to release or add teachers to the faculty in each school in such a way that would \nmove that school closer to the racial composition of the faculty system wide. \nThe specific racial proportions sought by phase two of the Detroit Board's plan are arbitrary and do \nnot withstand scrutiny.[19] 316*316 In planning for the implementation of phase two, Mr. Martin did not \n\nconfer with principals of the affected schools to determine whether specific transfers would adversely \nimpact their school. He merely examined the racial composition in each school by subject area and \nmade a judgment as to which department, in his view, had an excess of black or white teachers. Tr. \nat 1108-1114. Such inflexible adherence to specific racial ratios will result in teacher transfers which \ndo nothing more than alter faculty statistics and which bear no relationship to the ultimate purpose of \nachieving full desegregation of faculty and staff. For example, the Detroit Board proposes to transfer \nteachers from Central, Cooley, Kettering, King, McKenzie, Mumford, Murray-Wright, Northeastern, \nNorthwestern, and Southwestern despite the fact that each of these schools is already in compliance \nwith the proposed parameters of phase two. Cooley High School, predominantly black by student \nenrollment, would undergo a faculty change from 45.8% to 43.7% black. Tr. at 1305. This would \noccur even though Cooley High School is now within the parameters of the third phase of the Detroit \nBoard's proposal. Thus, to the extent that the goals of phase three of the Detroit Board's proposal \nare valid, Cooley students are impacted detrimentally by phase two. \nPhase three of the Detroit Board's proposal, however, is even more objectionable. It provides that \nwhen teachers are to be released from or added to a particular school, the Board will have sole \ndiscretion to assign teachers so that the faculty in each school more closely reflects the racial \ncomposition of the system as a whole. Tr. at 911-12. If the Board's contention that phase three is \nessential to afford plaintiffs an adequate remedy is correct, plaintiffs may never receive their remedy. \nThis is so because in regions where student enrollment is declining, a teacher is usually released \nand the position discontinued as no longer needed. Therefore, in Regions 1, 5 and 8 where there is \na pronounced decline in enrollment,[20] most of the faculty transactions effected by phase three will \ninvolve the release of teachers. Because additional releases will also occur from normal faculty \nattrition such as resignations, retirements and leaves of absence, black students in Regions 1, 5 and \n8 could not expect to interact with a larger number of white teachers; they could only expect to \ninteract with a smaller number of black teachers. Since phase three is not adverse to the faculty \nassignment goals advanced by the plaintiffs, they contend that the court may not prevent the Board \nfrom implementing it. This may be true, but we decline to enter an order sanctioning a proposal that \nwe think makes little or no sense. \nFurthermore, the ramifications of phase three upon the current collective bargaining agreement \nbetween the Board and the DFT are incalculable. Under that agreement, releases from a particular \nschool are based on seniority, subject to the provision that no release will occur if it causes a school \nfaculty to exceed 70% of one race. BX-2. Phase three of the Board's proposal would effectively \nobliterate all seniority rights of DFT members and replace one provision of the collective bargaining \nagreement with Board discretion. This provision of the collective bargaining agreement has never \nbeen adjudged to have caused a segregated faculty, so that when the DFT intervened in this \nlitigation, it did so as an innocent third party. Although we would not permit the DFT's collective \nbargaining agreement to stand in the way of providing plaintiffs' class with an \nadequate 317*317 remedy, neither will we unnecessarily enter a court order providing for the \nwholesale eradication of a provision in its collective bargaining agreement. We conclude that the \nDetroit Board's proposal is arbitrary, self-serving and not designed to maximize interaction between \nstudents and teachers of both races, and we reject it. \nBased upon the factual record made by the parties, we find that it is necessary for the court to set \nguidelines to further desegregate faculty and staff for several reasons. First, while it is true that no \nschool has a distribution of more than 70% of teachers of one race, one chance in three for students \nto interact with teachers of both races is not adequate. The school system can do better. The \nexhibits offered by the Detroit Board show particularly that in Regions 1, 5 and 8, there has been \nlittle improvement in the desegregative experience children are receiving from their teachers.[21] The \nproblem with the present faculty distribution is that schools with a predominance of black students \nalso have a predominantly black faculty, while schools which were traditionally white by student \nenrollment have a predominantly white faculty.[22] \n\nSecond, the decline in student enrollment and a lack of coordination in hiring policies between the \ncentral and regional boards affects the rate of change in the composition of faculty in the majority of \nthe schools. Mr. Martin explained the method utilized by the central board when releasing teachers \nbecause of declining enrollment. The principal of the affected school makes the initial determination \nthat a position is expendable. The teacher with the least seniority in that position is then released, \nunless the release of that teacher would cause the faculty composition to exceed 70% of one race, \nin which case the teacher of the opposite race with the least seniority is released. Tr. at 59-60. If the \nenrollment in a region remains stable, vacancies that arise by resignations, retirement and leaves of \nabsence present the only opportunity for the Detroit Board to implement phase three. In those \nregions where enrollment is declining, however, there is a tendency to close out the position when a \nvacancy occurs because it is no longer needed. Thus, the Detroit Board's ability to increase the \ndesegregative experience of Detroit students and \"balance staff\" as to qualifications, sex, age and \nexperience is somewhat limited in regions experiencing a declining enrollment. Tr. at 97-98. \nAlthough the DFT contends that the long range trend is toward a more \"balanced staff\" in all schools, \nplaintiffs should not be required to wait for their remedy. \nFinally, regional hiring practices are not uniform and tend to impede efforts to achieve further faculty \ndesegregation. The central board prepares a list of qualified and eligible applicants, but each \nregional board determines who will be hired from the list. Although this decision is subject to \napproval by the central board, approval is almost always received. Tr. at 819-24. Thus, if a majority \nblack region hires more black teachers than white, it would further impede the central board's efforts \nto balance staff. Tr. at 819.[23]The hiring of more black than white teachers appears to be occurring in \nall regions except Region 2. \nThus, we conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to an order that will afford a greater degree of \ninteraction between Detroit students and teachers of both races, that provides 318*318adequate \nflexibility to account for qualifications of the teacher to teach the subject and grade level, and further \npermits the balancing of faculty in each school by race, teaching experience, and sex. We believe \nthat the guidelines which we order implemented can be accomplished with minimal disruption of the \npresent composition of faculty and staff. \nThe DFT argues, as it has throughout this litigation, that Judge Roth's holding that neither the Detroit \nBoard nor the DFT engaged in de jure acts of segregation in faculty assignments precludes a \nremedial order reassigning faculty. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, reasoning that \nfaculty assignments help \"to mitigate the fact that the majority of Detroit's children are left in schools \nthat are overwhelmingly one race.\" 540 F.2d at 247. In Milliken II, making the same analogy, the \nSupreme Court said: \n[I]n United States v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., 395 U.S. 225 [89 S.Ct. 1670, 23 L.Ed.2d 263] \n(1969), the Court concerned itself not with pupil assignment, but with the desegregation of faculty \nand staff as part of the process of dismantling a dual system. In doing so, the Court, there speaking \nthrough Mr. Justice Black, focused on the reason for judicial concerns going beyond pupil \nassignment: \"The dispute . . . deals with faculty and staff desegregation, a goal that we have \nrecognized to be an important aspect of the basic task of achieving a public school system wholly \nfree from racial discrimination.\" Id. at 231-232 [89 S.Ct. at 1674]. (Emphasis supplied.) \nMontgomery County, therefore, stands firmly for the proposition that matters other than pupil \nassignment must on occasion be addressed by federal courts to eliminate the effects of prior \nsegregation. 433 U.S. at 282-83, 97 S.Ct. at 2758 (emphasis original). \nFinally, the DFT argues that the interim decision of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 \nS.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed. 396 (1977), precludes this court from making any additional faculty \nassignments. In Teamsters, the Court held that seniority systems which are otherwise \"bonafide\" are \n\nentitled to enforcement according to their terms even if they \"perpetuate\" or \"lock in\" the effects of \nprior discrimination. The DFT argues that \"by virtue of the decision in Teamsters, any remedy which \nmight otherwise be directed by this court is proscribed if it impacts on this otherwise lawful seniority \nsystem.\" Brief of DFT at 30, 32. We think this argument lacks merit. Teamsters dealt with \ncongressional intent in enacting Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It did not consider constitutional \nviolations or the power of a district court when correcting prior de jure acts of segregation. In any \nevent, the order which we enter does not impact on otherwise lawful seniority rights, since it directs \ntransfers which take into account seniority rights of teachers affected by the order. \n3. Monitoring Commission \nThe necessity to reconsider the pupil and faculty reassignment portions of our remedial decree has \noccasioned a reevaluation of the remaining aspect of that decree, the quality education components. \nThe task of monitoring the implementation of court-ordered remedial programs was assigned to a \ncourt-created Monitoring Commission, a group of citizens intended to reflect the city's racial and \nethnic composition. 402 F.Supp. at 1145. The Monitoring Commission has performed its mission \nadmirably. Each participant has served faithfully and is well deserving of the respect and undying \ngratitude of the community and the court. They have served as the \"eyes and ears\" of the community \nand court, observing and reporting on the progress of the defendant Detroit Board's implementation \nof the remedial programs included in the plan. Notwithstanding the numerous reports submitted by \nthe Commission, however, no party to this litigation has filed any pleadings to challenge in an \nadversary proceeding the reason for the Detroit Board's lagging implementation of the remedial \nprograms. The silence of the parties, particularly the plaintiffs, leads the court to believe that \nthe 319*319 interest of all parties in this component has been reasonably satisfied.[24] \nAlthough the Monitoring Commission has been a great benefit to the community and the court, its \nprolonged existence can have several seriously detrimental community effects as well. First, the \nMonitoring Commission may solidify unrealistic community aspirations that it can or will solve the \ndifficult problems plaguing the school district. For example, we have, on another occasion, stated \nthat this school board's principal difficulty concerns financing the cost of delivering quality \ndesegregated educational services. 402 F.Supp. at 1119. The school board's financial crisis is as \ncritical today as it was in 1975. It continues to face escalating educational costs at a time when \nstudent enrollment, upon which its financial resources depend, is decreasing at an alarming rate. A \nmonitoring commission cannot solve this problem, yet it may unwittingly impede the school board's \nability to achieve a solution. \nSecond, we are concerned that the prolonged existence of the Monitoring Commission will continue \nto stifle the growth of the School-Community Relations (parental involvement) component, a \nprogram we emphasized was essential to the continued vitality of a school district: \nWe agree with plaintiffs that an acceptable community relations plan should include provisions for \nschool-community liaison and parental involvement. The school-community relations program should \ngive real meaning to the decentralization anticipated by the Michigan Legislature and provide an \neffective vehicle for true community involvement in all the schools. To achieve maximum community \nparticipation the program should depend upon parental support; . . .. An effective community \nrelations program must develop a partnership between the community and the schools and must \ncooperate with traditional groups such as parent-teacher organizations and local school advisory \nboards. There should be a cooperative flow of information from the school to the community and \nfrom the community to the school . . .. The school-community relations organization should receive \ncomplete encouragement, budgetary support, direct assistance and a free flow of information from \nschool authorities. 402 F.Supp. at 1143. \n\nA fully decentralized school-community group can, in partnership with the school board, better solve \nthe problems facing this school district. Court-sanctioned monitoring commissions cannot actually \nsolve problems since they are neither a policy-making body nor a super school board. If the \ncommunity believes that an independent group of citizens is required to monitor the business of the \nschool administration, it is better that such a group spring from the community rather than from a \ncourt decree. Moreover, a viable community relations program can more economically perform its \nown monitoring functions. \nThird, prolonged court-sponsored monitoring creates the danger that the group will take on the role \nof advisors to elected officials charged with the responsibility of managing the affairs of the school \ndistrict. For example, some Monitoring Commission reports contain recommendations based upon \ninformation collected from the very source being monitored. This is a function which is a step beyond \nmonitoring. If recommendations and advice are to be given by a monitoring group, it is best that it \ncome from a group that is created and supported by the community. \nFourth, court-sponsored monitoring commissions may well prompt the state defendants to relax their \nsuperintending control over the affairs of the local school board. It is the responsibility of the state \ndefendants to monitor the steps taken to ascertain that Detroit children are receiving quality \ndesegregated educational services. The obstacles which impede the delivery of quality education \nmust be overcome by the state and local boards and broad based community 320*320 groups. We \nare also concerned that the Monitoring Commission's budgetary requirements now being furnished \nby the state will continue to increase. Those requirements now exceed $200,000 annually. This \namount can be used to better educational opportunities for Detroit school children. Surely, there are \nmore economical methods for performing the monitoring function.[25] \nFinally, we are deeply concerned that the members of the Monitoring Commission do not represent \na fair cross section of the school community. Although the school district is predominantly black, the \nMonitoring Commission as presently constituted is predominantly white. We must be sensitive to \nunfavorable impressions likely to occur when a court-ordered white monitoring commission \ncontinues indefinitely to audit a predominantly black school administration, especially one that \ncontains a remarkable number of highly competent staff members, totally sensitive to the needs of \nDetroit school children, black and white. Moreover, Detroit has a group of black leaders that is \ncompetent and interested in the needs of the school system. Prolonged court-sponsored monitoring \ncould very well stifle the developing interest of black leaders. We must bear in mind that the present \nschool administration is burdened with the task of remedying the de jure acts of segregation \ncommitted by a white board some 20 years ago, the individual members of which have long ago \nabandoned the city. Court-sponsored monitoring cannot aid in that task. In light of the above, we \nquestion the wisdom and necessity of retaining court-sponsored monitoring services. \nAccordingly, an order will be entered consistent with this opinion. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n[1] This observation did not escape the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 292, 97 S.Ct. \n2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Milliken II) (Powell, J., concurring). \n[2] Detroit Board of Education Exhibits will be designated BX followed by a letter or number. \n[3] If Mr. Henrickson was unable to depict a clear trend, he would use an average. Tr. at 27. \n[4] The city and school population has been declining steadily since 1950. 338 F.Supp. at 585. \n\n[5] For example, in 1971, 53.7% of the white children born five years earlier in Detroit entered kindergarten in the Detroit \nschool system. This retention rate decreased to 51.2% in 1972, to 48.1% in 1973, to 46.9% in 1974, to 42.2% in 1975, to \n40.2% in 1976 and to 39.0% in 1977. Tr. at 23. \n[6] Thus, during the period from 1971-1976, black students as a percent of total enrollment increased from 65.1% to 79.4%. \n[7] This pronounced demographic shift of black families is not occurring in Region 2, where there is a high concentration of \nSpanish surname families. \n[8] Five of the seven schools under 30% black are located in Region 2. Greenfield Union in Region 6 is only 26.1% black \nbecause of the large Chaldean population attending that school. The percentage of white students at Greenfield Union has \nactually increased somewhat apparently as a result of further movement of Chaldean children into this area who are counted \nas white. Tr. at 51. \n[9] Judge Roth traced the demographic history of the City of Detroit and its school district describing its change from a city \n91% white in 1920 to a metropolitan area in which whites have migrated to the suburbs leaving the city composed of \npredominantly poor black and poor aged and white families. White families continued to leave the outer portions of the city \nby either moving to the suburbs or placing their children in private schools, while black families continue to move into their \nplace from the core city. \n[10] Five of these six schools are in Region 2. \n[11] Western is significant because Judge Roth singled it out in his findings on liability as the school to which white students \ntransferred during the early 1960's to escape integration. \n[12] In Region 1, Burton School has 239 white students and 77 black students. Franklin School has 249 white students and \n97 black students. The remaining elementary schools in Region 1 have 7,062 black students and 615 white students. \n[13] The Detroit Board has always prepared its demographic data so as to reflect student enrollment, black, white, Spanish \nsurname, and other. The Detroit Board has argued that these separate categories are essential to comply with regulations of \nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare. \n[14] The Detroit Board is required by state law to provide bilingual education for all students requiring such services in all \nregions. M.C.L.A. § 380.1153(1) (1978 Supp.). \n[15] Grade restructuring and other aspects of the pupil reassignment plan necessitated the transfer of 1200 teachers. \n[16] Dr. Green relied upon the authoritative work of Albert Bandura, a leading authority on psychological modeling. Mr. \nBandura discusses in a special chapter the impact that role models play in the personality development of children. \n[17] Mr. Martin is a highly qualified staff member of the Detroit Board. His vast experience has given him an expertise on the \nrelationship of faculty assignments to the desegregative experience of Detroit students. He has a Bachelor's Degree in \nSocial Science, Psychology and English, a Master's Degree in Administration, Sociology and Social Science. He is presently \na doctoral candidate in Education Administration and Psychology. He has been an assistant principal and teacher in the \nDetroit school system. He also taught courses in sociology of urban schools at Wayne State University and the University of \nMichigan. Tr. at 278-79. \n[18] His testimony became less credible when, on cross-examination he admitted that under the theory he was advancing, \nthe faculty at the college where he is dean would be perceived as racially identifiably black. Tr. at 1370-71. \n[19] Mr. Martin testified that the HEW regulations will provide sufficient latitude to account for qualifications to teach the \ngrade level and subject, age, sex and other criteria for a balanced faculty, but he admitted that one motivation for choosing \nthese parameters was his belief that such faculty racial proportions were necessary under applicable regulations of HEW to \nsecure funding under the Emergency School Aid Act. Tr. at 1456. \nWe have already held that in a school district undergoing desegregation, HEW regulations are not controlling. A school \ndistrict is bound by constitutional precepts and not governmental regulations. Bradley v. Milliken, 432 F.Supp. 885 \n(E.D.Mich.1977). Arbitrary racial percentages are not designed to fit all school districts under all circumstances and they are \nno less undesirable merely because they have been predetermined by a governmental agency. \n\n[20] Regions 1 and 8, for example, have experienced a 6% annual decline in student enrollment from 1974-1977, while \nRegion 7 now 31.9% white, has experienced a decline of 9% annually. Tr. Sept. 6, 1977 at 23-28. \n[21] For example, in Region 1, 33 of 43 schools had a faculty more than 60% black in 1975; in April 1977, the comparable \nfigure was 30 of 34. In Region 5, the faculty in 27 of 34 schools was over 60% black in 1975, while the comparable figure in \n1977 was 26 of 34 schools. In Region 8, 22 of 38 schools had faculties that were more than 60% black in 1975 while in \n1977, 16 of 35 schools had a faculty with similar composition. See BX-10B, 4, 4A. \n[22] This is true not only with faculty but also with principals and department heads as well. For example, in Region 1 when \n88% of the schools had a predominantly black faculty, 57% of the schools had black principals and 66% black department \nheads. We agree with the plaintiffs that this cannot be the result of random assignment patterns. \n[23] There is no evidence that the central board's \"balance of staff\" goal has been followed by regional boards in their hiring \npractices. \n[24] Generally, monitoring commissions serve year to year and after three years of court-ordered monitoring services it is \nonly natural that we re-evaluate its mission. \n[25] For example, we could appoint a master with authority to conduct annual audits of school district records and submit a \nreport to the parties; or the school administration could be required by court order to submit annual reports, supported by \naffidavit, to all interested parties. \n ",

MILLIKEN, Governor of the State of Michigan, et al., \nDefendants. \nCivil No. 35257. \nUnited States District Court, E. D. Michigan, S. D. \nNovember 4, 1975. \nLouis R. Lucas, Ratner, Sugarmon & Lucas, Memphis, Tenn., Thomas Atkins, Boston, Mass., for \nplaintiffs. \nGeorge T. Roumell, Jr., Riley & Roumell, Detroit, Mich., Theodore Sachs, Marston, Sachs, \nO'Connell, Nunn & Freid, Detroit, Mich., George L. McCargar, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., Lansing, Mich., \nfor defendants. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nDeMASCIO, District Judge. \nAt the inception of the remedial phase of this litigation, the court directed the parties to submit plans \nto effectively establish a unitary school system. After affording the parties approximately 30 days to \nattempt to resolve their differences, the court conducted extensive 944*944 hearings on the plans \nsubmitted.[1] The parties were persistent in their different views of what constituted desegregation. \nThe plaintiffs adhered steadfastly to the view that desegregation required that the racial composition \nof every school in the system conform to within 15% of the system-wide racial ratio, that other \nconsiderations furthering integration were not relevant toward the formulation of a desegregation \nplan, and that existing practicalities at hand were not relevant. The defendant Detroit Board of \nEducation contended that a just and feasible plan must give consideration to the \"practicalities of the \nsituation\" such as the racial ratio existing in the school community, which is predominantly black by \nwide margins, shifting population trends and demography, the financial plight of the school district, \nthe need for school, neighborhood and community stability, and assurances that the district be able \nto provide optimal educational opportunities for all children, and that an effective desegregation plan \nshould not look merely to the present, but should desegregate \"now and hereafter\" by preventing \nresegregation. \nUpon completion of the hearings, the court carefully examined the plans together with all the \nevidence submitted. We concluded that both plans were too rigidly structured because of adherence \nto fixed racial ratios (which was found to be not only undesirable but constitutionally infirm), that both \nplans failed to properly weight the essential \"practicalities of the situation\", that neither plan \nexhausted alternatives in light of such practicalities, and that neither plan appropriately balanced the \n\nequitable burdens with the desegregative results achieved. On August 26, 1975, we directed the \ndefendant Detroit Board to prepare a revised plan, which was submitted on September 19, 1975. On \nOctober 8, 1975, we directed the Detroit Board to re-evaluate various aspects of its September 19, \n1975 plan, and the Board again submitted a revision on October 21, 1975. \nThus, this is the third occasion the court has had to carefully examine every detail of the Detroit \nBoard's desegregation plan. The sole purpose of our detailed examination has been to devise a \n\"just, feasible and equitable\" desegregation plan pursuant to a United States Supreme Court \nmandate that we formulate a \"decree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in the \nDetroit city schools. . . .\" We have found that the revised plan closely parallels the court's guidelines. \nThere are instances in which the Detroit Board employs parameters at variance with the guidelines, \nbut we have said that the Detroit Board may do so, provided the plan itself discloses that the \nadditional effort will have a salutary affect upon desegregation (Memorandum Opinion, August 15, \n1975, p. 121), since a cooperative board should be afforded discretion to weigh the practicalities at \nhand. This does not mean, however, that the Detroit Board is free to charter a course beyond the \nguidelines to accommodate individual philosophies or regional goals. We have been careful to \nensure that where the plan exceeds the court's guidelines, the plan discloses the practicalities \nconsidered and the reasons for affording varying weight to those practicalities. \nWe are satisfied that the revised plan, which we today order implemented with some modifications \nmade by the court,[2] is an effective and equitable desegregation plan within the constitutional \nguidelines that we have provided. The plan exhausts alternatives to two-way bussing, such as re-\nzoning and creation of satellites, and does not adhere to rigid racial ratios. Rather, the plan is \nflexible, as it permits variations derived by weighing the practicalities at hand and places into \nequitable balance the objectives sought and the results to be 945*945 achieved. (Memo. Op., p. \n87).[3] The plan recognizes the need to preserve walk-in schools in integrated neighborhoods, and \ncontains the flexibility needed to encourage stability in integrated neighborhoods. The flexibility of \nthe plan is further demonstrated by the fact that where reassignments are made at the elementary \nlevel, the students involved are assigned to a walk-in middle school or high school. Moreover, the \nplan provides for rotation of classes between paired schools to lessen or equalize the transportation \nburden (Memo. Op., pp. 91, 93). Most important, the plan avoids transportation serving no \ndesegregative purpose, such as bussing black children long distances to attend predominantly black \nschools. The court is satisfied that wherever transportation of white or black children is ordered, it \nserves a desegregative purpose. Thus, the plan is sensitive to the educational aspirations of the \nchildren and parents of Detroit who are not themselves responsible for the invidious violations \nexposed during the liability phase of these hearings. \nWe do not mean to imply that the plan, even with the modifications made by the court, is perfect. \nFuture events may well dictate that other selections are more desirable; practicalities will change. \nBut we are confident that, with the continued guidance of the court, the Detroit Board will remain \nresponsive to changing practicalities. We are reminded that, even after a finding of segregation, it is \nthe affirmative duty of the local school board to repair the effects of segregation. We found the \nDetroit Board is willing to assume its constitutional duty to do so (Memo. Op., p. 65) and have taken \ninto account that the \"good faith conduct on the part of any litigant in any court, especially a court of \nequity, and more particularly, in the sensitive area of desegregation, is a vital element for appropriate \nconsideration.\" [Memo. Op., p. 120, quoting Montgomery County Board of Education v. Carr, 400 \nF.2d 1, 2 (5th Cir. 1968).] Once the Detroit Board has accepted its responsibility, the court's only \nremaining obligation is \"to determine whether the structure designed by the school board will house \na unitary system.\" (Memo. Op., p. 121.) We are confident that the Detroit Board will continue to seek \nan equitable balance of the essential \"practicalities of the situation.\" \nWe have heretofore concluded that an appropriate plan must consider legitimate community \nconcerns. Thus, it is constitutionally permissible for the Detroit Board to consider practicalities that \n\ntruly exist and are not contrived to defeat desegregation. Such legitimate concerns deserving weight \ninclude the undesirability of forced student reassignments achieving only negligible desegregative \nresults, the undesirability of bussing black children to predominantly black schools, the rapidly \nshifting population trends occurring naturally in the school district, the decrease in overall student \nenrollment coupled with the persistent increase in black student enrollment, the predominantly black \nracial ratio, the depressed economy of the community created by the highest rate of unemployment \nin the nation, and the financially crippled school district's inability to improve its financial position \n(Memo. Op., p. 4). The Detroit community is thus assured that the court's guidelines and the plan \nimplemented pursuant thereto fully weigh all the \"practicalities of the situation\" and at the same time \nmake \"every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation.\" Davis v. School \nComm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 37, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 1292, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971).[4] We have \nbeen attentive to the 946*946 obvious need for residential stability (Memo. Op., p. 2). We have said \nand again emphasize that \". . . an effective and feasible remedy must prevent resegregation at all \ncosts. . . . In a school district that is only 26% white,[5] a remedy that does not take account of the \npossibility of resegregation will be short-lived and useless if that percentage of whites further \ndecreased.\" (Memo. Op., p. 4.) \nWe are fully aware of the community concern for the hardships involved in forced reassignments, \nparticularly through the use of school bussing. This awareness influenced the court to scrutinize \nevery school involved in the plan carefully to ascertain that the desegregative results achieved \nwarranted the burdens imposed. For example, the court rejected the reassignment of students from \nthe Grayling or Greenfield Union Schools, finding that, although each school was slightly under the \n30% black figure that the court used to define a desegregated school, \"[t]he presence of other \nminorities in significant numbers is a permissible practicality to be taken into account when deciding \nwhether a school should be included in reassignment plan.\" Memorandum and Order of October 8, \n1975, at p. 5. In another instance, the court objected to the pairing of the Beard and Wingert Schools \nbecause, even though substantial desegregation would result, we found it inequitable to pair Beard \nwith a school as far away as Wingert while other schools adjacent to Beard (Higgins, Harms and \nBennett) were paired with schools located much closer to their neighborhood. The court referred to \nits finding that \"there should not be great variances in the transportation burden falling on adjacent \nareas because such variations will influence residential patterns.\" (Memo. Op., p. 92.) To further \nillustrate the close scrutiny the court gave to each aspect of the reassignment plan, we were able to \neliminate much needless transportation in Region 7 by rejecting a Board proposal to convert the \nWayne Elementary School (92% white) to a middle school and transport Wayne students to Burbank \nSchool (97% white). We reminded the Detroit Board that \"the bussing of white children to \npredominantly white schools . . . serves no desegregative purpose and is no less objectionable [than \nthe bussing of black children to predominantly black schools].\" Memo. and Order of October 8, 1975, \nat p. 5. \nWhile some members of the community may be displeased over some of the reassignments the \ncourt has deemed essential, it is our hope that their burden will be made easier to bear by the \nknowledge that the court has given full consideration to every reassignment and has permitted the \nreassignment of students only where it has concluded that the desegregative results achieved justify \nthe burdens imposed. Moreover, Detroit citizens can be further assured that the court has taken \nsteps to improve the quality of education and has not permitted transfers where the receiving school \nis not comparable in all respects to the sending school. With assurances that the court and the \nDetroit Board have carefully weighed the practicalities, we are confident that the Detroit community \nwill recognize that what is implemented today is constitutionally mandated. The citizens of Detroit \nknow that the law must be obeyed. \nWe have said that a successful desegregative effort emphasizing quality education will require the \ncooperation and the support of the entire community. We know that Detroiters have always \nvolunteered community support to advance worthwhile causes. We know of no greater cause than \n\nrejuvenating the vitality of the city's schools. A vibrant school system will assure stability for city and \ncommunity alike. Having assured the Detroit community that the court has weighed the practicalities \nof the situation fully, we are confident that the plan will receive the cooperation and support of the \nentire community. When 947*947 cooperation and support are granted freely, the plan will succeed. \nThe support of the community will afford the Detroit school system an opportunity to make a fresh \nstart. This support will enable the school system to fulfill the community aspirations for desegregated \nquality education for all children. It is our belief that the guidelines announced will create a unitary \nschool system of which Detroit citizens can be proud. A quality school system will evolve that is \nconcerned not with black children nor white children, but just children. \nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the defendant Detroit Board of Education implement \nand cause to be implemented the desegregation plan on or before the beginning of the Winter \nSemester, 1976; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant Detroit Board of Education shall direct its Interim \nGeneral Superintendent to formulate a program for the implementation of the desegregation plan, \nand that the defendant Detroit Board of Education shall submit to the court, on or before December \n19, 1975, the program as formulated for the appropriate implementation; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to the October 2, 1975 order of the U.S. Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the parties hereto shall appear before this court on December 1, 1975, at 9:00 \nA.M., for an appropriate order concerning school closings proposed on pages 10-11 of the defendant \nDetroit Board of Education's submission of October 21, 1975. \nAPPENDIX \nThe plan has been developed from the Detroit Board of Education's submissions of September 19 \nand October 21, 1975. We recognize that the successful implementation of a desegregation plan will \nrequire solutions to a variety of problems and that the rapidly shifting population trend may create \nnew problems. \nBecause the school district reschedules classes each semester as a part of its regular practice, we \ndo not see any difficulty in implementing the plan at the start of the winter semester at the lower \ngrade level.[1] Moreover, since many high schools already enroll the ninth grade, we do not see \nmany problems caused by the reassignment of ninth graders pursuant to the court's order to change \njunior high schools to grade 6-8 middle schools. However, desegregation of the high schools poses \na number of problems not faced by elementary and middle schools. Since school programs become \nmore specialized at higher grade levels, special provisions must be made for the phasing in of the \nplan at the high school level. Reassignments occurring during the school year may pose an \nespecially difficult burden for high school students because of the possibility that the receiving high \nschool will not have the same educational programs as the sending high school. \nWhile there is no easy solution to the problem of desegregating the high schools, the Detroit Board \nmay wish to consider a change in the method of high school assignments that will facilitate \ndesegregation. While the Detroit Board makes assignments of students to high schools that are \ndependent upon middle school or junior high school assignments, many school districts structure \nhigh school attendance zones without regard to junior high school assignments. Such a method of \nassignment possesses greater flexibility and might be of aid to desegregation. The Detroit Board's \npresent method of making high school assignments places unnecessary constraints on \ndesegregation, and does not minimize student travel to high school. The Detroit Board may wish to \nconsider making high school assignments on the basis of elementary attendance zones alone, with \n\nzones possibly being split where it proves advantageous for desegregation or convenience of \nstudents. 948*948 This recommendation is particularly appropriate for Regions 4, 6 and 7. Moreover, \nwhere high school students are reassigned for desegregative purposes, fairness would require that \nthey be provided transportation where they are assigned to a high school more than two miles from \ntheir residence. \nThe Detroit Board of Education should require that its staff review the attached plan in detail to \nassure that it is just and feasible. The responsibility remains with the Detroit Board to notify the court \nif features in the plan require revision because of changing practicalities. In that event, the Detroit \nBoard should proceed by filing a petition for revision of any specific school assignment for the court's \nconsideration. \nFinally, the Detroit Board of Education shall establish and publicize an information center that is \nadequately equipped and staffed to provide a source for dispensing accurate information concerning \nthe desegregation plan to the public and school community. In addition to responding to inquiries, \nthe information center should have a mechanism for accepting suggestions and constructive \ncriticism from parents and other members of the community. \n[1] The hearings extended from April 29 to June 27, 1975, consuming approximately nine weeks. \n[2] We have concluded that a desegregation plan must be implemented during the Winter Term 1976. Time considerations \nwill not permit another request for re-evaluation of the modifications mandated. \n[3] Our guidelines discard the use of rigid ratios in the desegregative effort. We suggest a 50-50 racial ratio as a starting \npoint, but permit deviation therefrom depending upon the practicalities surrounding each individual school. \n[4] The plan tracks the court's guidelines as well as might be expected. The school authorities transport approximately \n22,000 students and provide walk-in schools for an additional 6,000 students. It is important to emphasize that the school \ndistrict has always transported 14,000 students to relieve overcrowding and to avoid hazardous crossings. By more efficient \nuse of the transportation already existing, the plan realizes a net gain of 8,000. \n[5] The 1975 fourth Friday count discloses that this figure is now 23% white. \n[1] It is difficult to ascertain from the plan the precise pairing procedures employed. In Region 2, for example, we have \ndesignated schools where rotation pairing is appropriate (see p. 13 of the Plan). \n ",

Gen., Lansing, Mich., on brief. \nBefore PHILLIPS, Chief Judge, and EDWARDS and PECK, Circuit Judges. \nPER CURIAM. \nThis is the second appeal to this court in a case in which there has been no hearing on the merits. \nPlaintiffs-appellants have alleged that the school system of the City of Detroit is being operated in an \nunconstitutional manner by failing to conform to the standards enunciated in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, Alexander v. Holmes County Board of \nEducation, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19, and other decisions of the Supreme Court on \nthe issue of desegregation of the public schools. As a consequence, it is asserted that remedial \norders by the District Court are necessary to correct the situation. On the present appeal relief is \nsought in this court in the form of a motion for summary reversal or in the alternative for injunction \npending appeal. \nIn our decision on the previous appeal, Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir.), this court \naffirmed the order of the District Court refusing to grant a preliminary injunction and remanded the \ncase for a hearing on its merits. \n\nThe issue in this case is not what might be a desirable Detroit school plan, but whether or not there \nare constitutional violations in the school system as presently operated, and, if so, what relief is \nnecessary to avoid further impairment of constitutional rights. There must be a trial on the merits as \nto the alleged constitutional violations as a predicate to relief in the federal courts. On the present \nappeal a second effort is made to persuade this court to grant summary relief. The trouble with this \nprocedure is that there has never been an evidentiary hearing on the 947*947 charges set forth in \nthe complaint nor any findings of fact with respect to these charges. \nAt the time of the hearing of the previous appeal, representations were made to this court that an \nearly trial on the merits would be conducted in the District Court. The opinion recited that the District \nJudge not only conducted an expeditious hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction but \nhad advanced the case on his docket to early in November 1970, and alloted two weeks for the trial. \nThis court further said: \"We conclude that the issues presented in this case, involving the school \nsystem of a large city, can best be determined only after a full evidentiary hearing.\" 433 F.2d at 905. \nIn an effort to facilitate the hearing in the District Court of the case on its merits, this court expedited \nthe rendering of its decision on the former appeal, releasing its opinion October 13, 1970, two weeks \nafter oral argument. \nAgainst this background, we do not consider the actions of the parties or the District Judge to have \nbeen in accord with the directive of this court. \nInstead of proceeding with the trial on its merits as scheduled, plaintiffs-appellants filed in the District \nCourt a motion for the immediate implementation of the \"April 7 Plan.\" The District Court thereupon \npostponed the hearing on the merits to December 8, 1970, and conducted a hearing on the motion. \nOn November 6, 1970, the District Court entered an order directing that the Detroit Board of \nEducation submit a high school attendance area plan \"consisting of that portion of the action taken \nby the Defendant Detroit Board of Education on April 7, 1970, going to the changing of attendance \nareas of certain named high schools in the City of Detroit, or an updated version thereof which \nachieves no less pupil integration.\" \nInstead of submitting one plan as directed by the District Court, the Board of Education on \nNovember 16, 1970, submitted to the court three alternative plans assigning first priority to the \n\"McDonald Plan\" or \"Magnet School Plan,\" second priority to the \"Magnet Curriculum Plan\" and third \npriority to the \"April 7 Plan.\" \nOn December 3, 1970, the District Court entered an order directing that the Board implement the \n\"McDonald Plan\" at the beginning of the next full school year in September 1971 and continued the \ntrial, theretofore scheduled to commence on December 8, 1970, \"to a date to be fixed by the Court \nafter a review of its calendar and its readjustment.\" Plaintiffs-appellants filed a notice of appeal from \nthat order. \nIn our former opinion this court said: \n\"[W]e express no opinion at the present stage of the case as to the merits of the plan adopted by the \nSchool Board on April 7, 1970, or as to whether it was the constitutional obligation of the School \nBoard to adopt all or any part of that plan.\" 433 F.2d at 904. \nLikewise in the present opinion this court expresses no views as to the \"McDonald Plan,\"[1] the \"April \n7 Plan\" or any other plan proposed by any of the parties to this litigation, or as to the constitutional \nobligation of the School Board to adopt any of these plans. \n\nSince there has been no trial to determine whether the school system of Detroit is now operated \nunder an unconstitutional plan, nor any finding to that effect, the motion for summary reversal is \noverruled. The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions that the case be set forthwith \nand heard on its merits and that appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law be \nmade 948*948 in accordance with Rule 52(a), Fed.R. Civ.P. \nNo costs are assessed. Each party will bear his own costs on this appeal. \nRemanded. \n[1] But see, Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed. 2d 716; Raney v.

See 97 S.Ct. 380. \n\nPHILLIPS, Chief Judge. \nWhen this school desegregation case was filed in August 1970, Ronald Bradley, one of the black \nplaintiffs, had been assigned to enter the kindergarten of a Detroit school whose enrollment was 97 \nper cent black. There have been numerous court proceedings since that time, culminating in the \nopinion of the Supreme Court in Milliken v. Bradley,418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 \n(1974), reversing the en banc decision of this court reported at 484 F.2d 215 (1973). The Supreme \nCourt remanded with directions for \"prompt formulation of a decree directed to eliminating the \nsegregation found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy which has been delayed since \n1970.\" 418 U.S. at 753, 94 S.Ct. at 3131. \nThis court now reviews appeals and cross-appeals from various orders and decisions of the District \nCourt, two of which are reported at 402 F.Supp. 1096 (1975) and 411 F.Supp. 943 (1975). \nIn September 1976 Ronald Bradley is scheduled to enter the sixth grade of the Clinton School, \nwhich now is more than 99 per cent black.[1] The decisions of the District Court which we now review \ndo nothing to correct the racial composition of the Clinton School. They grant no relief to Ronald \nBradley nor to the majority of the class of black students he represents. \nNevertheless, this court finds itself in the frustrating position of having to leave standing the results \nreached by the District Judge on the issue of assignment of students, although we disagree with \nparts of his opinions and orders. Our affirmance is found to be necessary for the simple reason that \nreversal would be an exercise in futility under the situation now existing in the Detroit school system \nand the law of this case as established by the Supreme Court in Milliken v. Bradley. \nOther questions raised by the appeals of various parties will be discussed later in this opinion. \nI. Prior Findings as to Constitutional Violations \nThis litigation had its genesis under modest circumstances. On April 7, 1970, before the filing of any \nsuit, the Detroit Board of Education on its own initiative adopted a plan to effect a more balanced \ndistribution of black and white students in 12 of the 21 Detroit high schools. The April 7 plan was to \ntake effect over a three-year period, applying initially to those students entering 233*233 the tenth \ngrade in September, 1970. In the eleventh grade the plan was to have been effected at the opening \nof the 1971-72 school year and the twelfth grade at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year. The \nplan was designed to reduce segregation in a school system that then was 63.6 percent black. \nOn July 7, 1970, however, the Governor of Michigan signed into law Act No. 48, Public Acts of 1970. \nSection 12 of this Act had the effect of delaying and ultimately blocking the implementation of \nDetroit's April 7 plan. The four members of the Detroit Board of Education who supported the April 7 \nplan were removed from office through a recall election. Four new members were appointed by the \nGovernor of Michigan. These four members, together with the incumbent members, who had \nopposed the April 7 plan from its inception, thereafter rescinded it. \nThe complaint in the present case was filed August 18, 1970. Among other things, the complaint \nprayed for a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to put into effect the plan adopted by the \nDetroit Board of Education on April 7 and restraining the defendants from giving any force or effect \nto § 12 of Act 48 insofar as it would inhibit immediate implementation of the April 7 plan. On \nSeptember 3, 1970, the late District Judge Stephen J. Roth denied plaintiffs' application for a \npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs immediately filed a notice of appeal and a motion in this case for \ninjunction pending appeal. \n\nOn September 8, 1970, the day of the opening of the 1970-71 Detroit school term, the Chief Judge \nof the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments on the application for an injunction to place the April 7 plan \nin effect pending appeal. The Chief Judge entered an order denying the application for injunction \npending appeal and advanced the case on the docket of this court for argument on its merits. In an \nopinion announced October 13, 1970, reported at 6 Cir., 433 F.2d 897, this court held § 12 of \nMichigan Act 48 to be unconstitutional, ruled that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in \ndenying the preliminary injunction and remanded the case for a trial on the merits. On remand, the \nDistrict Court again refused to put the April 7 plan into effect. The plaintiffs moved for summary \nreversal or injunction pending appeal. In an opinion reported at 6 Cir., 438 F.2d 945 (1971), this \ncourt again remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing on the merits. \nAfter extensive hearings, Judge Roth found as a fact that de jure segregation existed in the Detroit \npublic schools. D.C., 338 F.Supp. 582 (1971). Included in his findings of fact were the following: \n[W]e find that both the State of Michigan and the Detroit Board of Education have committed acts \nwhich have been causal factors in the segregated condition of the public schools of the City of \nDetroit. 338 F.Supp. at 592. \nThis court held that the foregoing findings of fact by Judge Roth were not clearly erroneous, \nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but to the contrary were supported by ample evidence. We said: \nThe discriminatory practices on the part of the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan \nrevealed by this record are significant, pervasive and causally related to the substantial amount of \nsegregation found in the Detroit school system by the District Judge. 484 F.2d at 241. \nThe constitutional violations found to have been committed by the Detroit Board of Education are \ndiscussed in some detail at 484 F.2d 221-38. The constitutional violations found to have been \ncommitted by the State of Michigan are discussed at 484 F.2d 238-41. \nWe do not read the opinion of the Supreme Court as disagreeing with or disturbing in any way the \nfindings of unlawful segregation with respect to the Detroit school system. To the contrary, as \npointed out above, the Supreme Court remanded the case with a mandate for \"prompt formulation of \na decree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy that \nhas been delayed since 1970.\" 418 U.S. at 753, 94 S.Ct. at 3131. \n234*234 II. The Remedy \nIt is the law of this case that both the State of Michigan and the Detroit Board of Education have \ncommitted acts which have been causal factors in creating the de jure segregation which exists in \nthe public schools of Detroit. The principal question to be resolved on the present appeal involves \nthe remedy. District Judge Stephen J. Roth died July 11, 1974. The responsibility for providing a \nremedy in obedience of the mandate of the Supreme Court was assigned to District Judge Robert E. \nDeMascio, author of the opinions reported at D.C., 402 F.Supp. 1096 and D.C., 411 F.Supp. 943, \nwhich are involved on the present appeal. \na) Previous Efforts to Effect a Remedy \nAfter his finding of de jure segregation, Judge Roth grappled with the problem of fashioning a \nremedy in accordance with Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971), Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U.S. 450, 88 S.Ct. 1700, 20 L.Ed.2d 733 \n\n(1968), Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 \n(1968) and Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955). Initially \nhe contemplated a \"Detroit only\" solution. A motion was made to add other school districts as parties \ndefendant. Judge Roth reserved a decision on this motion pending submission and consideration of \ndesegregation plans. 338 F.Supp. at 595. \nJudge Roth required the school board defendants, Detroit and State, to develop and submit plans of \ndesegregation, \"designed to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking \ninto account the practicalities of the situation.\" Three \"Detroit only\" desegregation plans were \nsubmitted by the plaintiffs and by the Detroit Board of Education. Judge Roth found that: \n[W]hile plaintiffs' plan would accomplish more desegregation than now obtains in the system, or \nwhich would be achieved under Plan A or C of the Detroit Board of Education submissions, none of \nthe plans would result in the desegregation of the public schools of the Detroit school district. . . . \n[R]elief of segregation in the Detroit public schools cannot be accomplished within the corporate \ngeographical limits of the city. 345 F.Supp. at 916 (1972). \nJudge Roth concluded that he had the duty to look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for \na solution to the illegal segregation in the Detroit public schools. 345 F.Supp. at 916.[2] \nThe parties submitted a number of plans of metropolitan desegregation, including six by the State \nBoard of Education (made without recommendation), all of which were rejected. Judge Roth \nthereupon appointed a nine member panel \"charged with the responsibility of preparing and \nsubmitting an effective desegregation plan.\" 345 F.Supp. at 916. \nThis was the posture of the decision of Judge Roth at the time four interlocutory orders were \nreviewed by the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), together with one final order relating to \nthe purchase of school buses. No desegregation plan was ever adopted by Judge Roth or approved \nby this court. \nAs already noted, this court agreed with Judge Roth that the State of Michigan had committed acts \nof de jure segregation. In ruling on the interlocutory appeal, we also agreed that the State controls \nthe instrumentalities whose action is necessary to remedy the harmful effect of the State acts, 484 \nF.2d at 245-49, and concluded: \nIn the instant case the only feasible desegregation plan involves the crossing of the boundary lines \nbetween the Detroit School District and adjacent or nearby school districts for the limited purpose of \nproviding an effective desegregation plan. 484 F.2d at 249. \nWe said: \nThis court in considering this record finds it impossible to declare \"clearly erroneous\" 235*235 the \nDistrict Judge's conclusion that any Detroit only desegregation plan will lead directly to a single \nsegregated Detroit school district overwhelmingly black in all of its schools, surrounded by a ring of \nsuburbs and suburban school districts overwhelmingly white in composition in a State in which the \nracial composition is 87 per cent white and 13 per cent black. 484 F.2d at 249. \nThis court held that it would be within the equity power of the District Court to adopt a plan of \ndesegregation extending beyond the boundaries of the Detroit School District. We remanded the \ncase to the District Court for the taking of additional evidence because several of the suburban \nschool districts had not been heard or had an opportunity to be heard. We held that as a prerequisite \n\nto the implementation of a plan affecting any school district, \"the affected district must be made a \nparty to this litigation and afforded an opportunity to be heard.\" 484 F.2d 250-52.[3] \nThe Supreme Court reversed the decision of this court, holding that no remedy involving any school \ndistrict other than Detroit would be within the equitable power of the District Court without evidence \nthat the suburban district or districts had committed acts of de jure segregation. In his separate \nconcurring opinion, Mr. Justice Stewart explained the grounds for reversal in this language: \n236*236 In reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals this Court is in no way turning its back on \nthe proscription of state-imposed segregation first voiced in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. \n483 [74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873], or on the delineation of remedial powers and duties most recently \nexpressed in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 [91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 554]. In Swann the Court addressed itself to the range of equitable remedies available to the \ncourts to effectuate the desegregation mandated by Brown and its progeny, noting that the task in \nchoosing appropriate relief is \"to correct . . the condition that offends the Constitution,\" and that \"the \nnature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy . . ..\" Id. [402 U.S.] at 16 [91 S.Ct. at \n1276]. \nThe disposition of this case thus falls squarely under these principles. The only \"condition that \noffends the Constitution\" found by the District Court in this case is the existence of officially \nsupported segregation in and among public schools in Detroit itself. There were no findings that the \ndiffering racial composition between schools in the city and in the outlying suburbs was caused by \nofficial activity of any sort. It follows that the decision to include in the desegregation plan pupils from \nschool districts outside Detroit was not predicated upon any constitutional violation involving those \nschool districts. By approving a remedy that would reach beyond the limits of the city of Detroit to \ncorrect a constitutional violation found to have occurred solely within that city the Court of Appeals \nthus went beyond the governing equitable principles established in this Court's decisions. 418 U.S. \nat 757, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3133. \nb) The Remedy at Issue on Present Appeals \nDistrict Judge DeMascio was faced with an extremely difficult (if not impossible) assignment, \nconfronted as he was with the responsibility of formulating a decree which would eliminate the \nunconstitutional segregation found to exist in the Detroit public schools, without transgressing the \nlimits established by the Supreme Court. \nLike Judge Roth, Judge DeMascio required the plaintiffs and the Detroit Board of Education to \nsubmit desegregation plans. Like Judge Roth, he rejected both plans as unsatisfactory. By his \nopinion of August 15, 1975, D.C., 402 F.Supp. 1096-1147, he outlined the details of this involved \nlitigation, made findings of fact and adopted remedial guidelines. By his opinion of November 4, \n1975, D.C., 411 F.Supp. 943, the District Judge adopted a desegregation plan drafted by the Detroit \nBoard in accordance with the August 15 guidelines. Reference is made to these two opinions for a \nrecitation of pertinent facts. Various amendatory and supplemental orders also have been entered \nby the District Court, which will be mentioned in this opinion only to the extent necessary to dispose \nof issues raised on this appeal. \nThe plaintiffs-appellants attack the plan as \"bizarre\" and urge its reversal. The Detroit Board of \nEducation contends that the plan is constitutional and should be affirmed. The State defendants take \nthe position that the pupil assignment plan meets constitutional requirements for desegregating the \nDetroit school system and should be affirmed, but contend that the District Court exceeded its \n\nauthority in requiring certain \"educational components\" and in directing that the State pay 50 per \ncent of the cost of these programs. \nThe plan adopted by the District Court became effective as of the beginning of the winter-spring \nsemester, 1976. As of September 26, 1975, the Detroit public schools enrolled 247,774 students, \n75.1 per cent of whom were black. In broad outline the plan adopted by the District Court required \nthe reassignment of 27,524 students, of whom 21,853 would require bus transportation. The plan \nchanged the racial balance in 105 schools out of approximately 300 zoned schools in the system. \nPrior to the implementation of the plan, approximately 237*237 80 schools had enrollments of a \nmajority of white students. Under the District Court's plan, 67 of these schools received black \nstudents through transportation and rezoning. The result of the student reassignments is that no \nschool in Detroit, with two marginal exceptions, will have an enrollment of less than 30 per cent black \nstudents. Moreover, 47 of the previously white schools have become more than 40 per cent black. \nIn addition, 38 schools, the majority of which previously were at least 80 per cent black, received \nwhite students via transportation and rezoning. Under the plan, 25 of these schools became 45 to 55 \nper cent black. Furthermore, at least 23 of Detroit's schools, enrolling approximately 22,599 \nstudents, contain a substantial mix of black and white students without any student reassignment. \nIn order to effectuate the reassignment of students, the District Court ordered the purchase of 250 \nschool buses.[4] \nFinally, the District Court ordered the closing of certain antiquated schools, the establishment of \nvocational centers available on a non-racial basis to all qualifying students, and certain Educational \nComponents, hereinafter discussed in further detail. \nTo the credit of the citizens of Detroit, the record discloses that the court's plan, although \nimplemented in the middle of a school year, was accepted in an orderly manner and in a spirit of \ncommunity cooperation, without substantial disruption or disorder. \nAlthough some improvements have been accomplished by the District Court, the plan contains \nglaring defects that could never pass constitutional muster and would not be countenanced by this \ncourt in a different factual situation. \nAs of September 1974, prior to the implementation of the plan, the percentages of black students in \nthe eight school regions were as follows: \n  Region # 1 .... 90.3%  black \n  Region # 2 .... 60.3%  black \n  Region # 3 .... 70.8%  black \n  Region # 4 .... 55.5%  black \n  Region # 5 .... 96.7%  black \n  Region # 6 .... 63.1%  black \n  Region # 7 .... 45.2%  black \n  Region # 8 .... 95.2%  black \n \n           402 F.Supp. at 1106. \nNotwithstanding the reassignments effected by the District Court, the percentage of black students in \neach of the eight regions remains substantially unchanged under the adopted plan. Only twelve of \nthe 157 zoned schools with previous enrollments over 90 percent black have become under 90 \npercent black. Approximately half of Detroit's schools remain more than 90 percent black. Moreover, \n\nthe three regions which contain the highest concentration of black students, regions 1, 5 and 8, \nremain virtually untouched. This means that approximately 83,000 students are granted no relief \nfrom unconstitutional de jure segregation. \nThe Supreme Court has said that the existence of some one-race schools \"is not in and of itself the \nmark of a system that still practices segregation by law.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). We recognize that the \noverwhelming number of black students in Detroit and their concentration in the inner city \nundoubtedly makes some one-race schools unavoidable under any \"Detroit only\" remedy. However, \nwhen the Detroit School Board virtually eliminated regions 1, 5 and 8 from both its initial plan and the \nplan finally adopted, it assumed the heavy burden of justifying its elimination of the schools located \nin these three regions. In Swann the Supreme Court stated: \n238*238 Where the school authority's proposed plan for conversion from a dual to a unitary system \ncontemplates the continued existence of some schools that are all or predominantly of one race, \nthey have the burden of showing that such school assignments are genuinely nondiscriminatory. The \ncourt should scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school authorities will be to satisfy the \ncourt that their racial composition is not the result of present or past discriminatory action on their \npart. 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281. \nThe Board's burden of justification is particularly heavy in this case because the three regions which \nthe Board has left untouched, in the inner city, are in the area most affected by the acts of de jure \nsegregation of which both the Detroit and State defendants have been found guilty. \nThe records discloses no adequate justification for excluding regions 1, 5 and 8 from the plan. The \nprincipal testimony pertaining to the reasons for excluding the inner city from student reassignments \ncame from Merle Henrickson, Director of Planning and Building Studies for the Detroit Board. Mr. \nHenrickson stated that the inner city \"was beyond the limits of possible treatment.\" Exclusion of the \ninner city was necessary, in his view, in order to maintain \"the racial mix of desegregated schools.\" \nThe result of desegregating the inner city, he predicted, would be white flight. \nThe need for stability in a desegregation plan was emphasized by the Supreme Court in Pasadena \nCity Board of Education v. Spangler, ___ U.S. ___, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d ___ (1976). \nApprehension of white flight, however, cannot be used to deny basic relief from de jure segregation. \nAs said by the Supreme Court in a slightly different context: \nThe primary argument made by the respondents in support of Chapter 31 is that the separation of \nthe Scotland Neck schools from those of Halifax County was necessary to avoid \"white flight\" by \nScotland Neck residents into private schools that would follow complete dismantling of the dual \nschool system. Supplemental affidavits were submitted to the Court of Appeals documenting the \ndegree to which the system has undergone a loss of students since the unitary school plan took \neffect in the fall of 1970. But while this development may be cause for deep concern to the \nrespondents, it cannot, as the Court of Appeals recognized, be accepted as a reason for achieving \nanything less than complete uprooting of the dual public school system. See Monroe v. Board of \nCommissioners, 391 U.S. 450, 459 [88 S.Ct. 1700, 1705, 20 L.Ed.2d 733]. United States v. Scotland \nNeck Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 490-91, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 2218, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972). \nThe District Court did not subject the exclusion of these three regions to the close scrutiny required \nby Swann. The District Court merely noted: \n\nPlaintiffs refuse to acknowledge that the racial composition of these three regions precludes their \ninclusion in a desegregation plan. . . . Clearly, it would be futile to attempt desegregation within the \nboundaries of these regions . . .. 402 F.Supp. at 1129. \nThis perfunctory treatment of the inner city falls far short of the \"root and branch\" requirements \nof Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), and \nthe \"all-out desegregation\" requirements of Keyes v. School District, 413 U.S. 189, 214, 93 S.Ct. \n2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). \nIn Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 577 (1971), Chief Justice Burger, speaking for a unanimous court, held that the eastern part \nof metropolitan Mobile cannot be treated \"in isolation from the rest of the school system.\" 402 U.S. at \n38, 91 S.Ct. at 1292. It seems equally unacceptable to treat Regions 1, 5 and 8 in isolation from the \nrest of the Detroit school system. \nThe Detroit Board of Education contends that the exclusion of Regions 1, 5 and 8 from the plan is \nsupported by the decision 239*239 of the Supreme Court in Pasadena City Board of Education v. \nSpangler, ___ U.S. ___, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d ___ (1976). This contention is without merit. In \nthe present case the plan adopted by the District Court, which we affirm in part, is the first remedy \nadopted in an effort to cure the effects of de jure segregation. We hold this remedy to be insufficient \nas to Regions 1, 5 and 8. This is not a Spangler situation. The Detroit Board also relies \non Washington v. Davis, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2041, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). We find \nthis decision to be inapplicable here because it is the law of this case that unlawful de jure \nsegregation, for which both the Detroit Board and State defendants are in part responsible, exists in \nthe Detroit school system. \nEven though we do not approve of that part of the District Court's plan which fails to take any action \nwith respect to schools in Regions 1, 5 and 8, this court finds itself unable to give any direction to the \nDistrict Court which would accomplish the desegregation of the Detroit school system in light of the \nrealities of the present racial composition of Detroit. Compare Calhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th \nCir. 1975), rehearing denied, 525 F.2d 1203 (1975). \nPlaintiffs urge that we reverse and require the District Court to adopt the plan proposed by them. The \nreasons stated by the District Judge for rejecting plaintiffs' plan are set forth at 402 F.Supp. 1123-25. \nThe District Court found that this proposal would require transportation of 77,000 to 81,000 students \nand the purchase of approximately 840 school buses. Much of the transportation would be of black \nstudents from predominately black schools to other predominately black schools and the plan \nnevertheless would leave a majority of Detroit's students in schools 75 to 90 per cent black. \nOur considered judgment is that plaintiffs' plan would accelerate the trend toward rendering all or \nnearly all of Detroit's schools so identifiably black as to represent universal school segregation within \nthe city limits. The anticipated positive results, if any, would not justify the expense and hardship that \ninevitably would be involved. We agree with the District Judge that plaintiffs' plan would not satisfy \nthe Supreme Court's mandate in this case. \nA second alternative would be to reverse and order adoption of the plan originally proposed by the \nDetroit Board of Education. We have considered this alternative carefully and reject it because the \nplan originally proposed by the Board is not significantly different from the plan adopted by the court. \nLike the plan adopted by the court, the original Board proposal would have left Regions 1, 5 and 8 \nunaffected, with no changes in the allocation of students in the predominately black schools in those \nregions. The Board's original plan is based on the same erroneous theory as the plan adopted by the \ncourt—that the mere elimination of identifiably white schools satisfies the criteria of Brown. \n\nThe Board's proposal as originally suggested might have been preferable to the plan approved by \nthe court. However, the Board now urges affirmance of the plan which it adopted pursuant to the \nDistrict Court's guidelines. As pointed out above, this plan has been well received by the citizens of \nDetroit. \nWe conclude that the differences between the two plans are so inconsequential that the compulsory \nadoption of the Board's original plan by order of this court would produce more confusion than any \npossible good that would be accomplished. \nA third alternative would be to reverse and direct that the District Court assign the white students \nnow remaining in the Detroit school system among the predominately black schools on a percentage \nbasis somewhat along the lines originally proposed by plaintiffs. It is obvious that such a requirement \nwould accomplish nothing more than token integration, and that of uncertain duration. \nRecognizing the absence of alternatives, we affirm the judgment of the District Court on the issue of \nassignment of students in areas other than Regions 1, 5 240*240 and 8. In affirming the District \nJudge's limited desegregation plan, we observe that the steps which he has taken thus far appear to \nus to be consistent with the fourteenth amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Milliken \nv. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). We must, however, remand the \ncase for further consideration in regard to the three central regions of the City of Detroit which both \nthe school board and the District Judge excluded from their proposed remedial plans. We cannot \nhold that where unconstitutional segregation has been found, a plan can be permitted to stand which \nfails to deal with the three regions where the majority of the most identifiably black schools are \nlocated. \nWe recognize that it would be appropriate for us at this point to supply guidelines to the District \nJudge as to what he should do under this remand. Omission of such guidelines is not based on any \nfailure to consider the problem in depth. It is based upon the conviction which this court had at the \ntime of its en banc opinion in this case—and for the reasons carefully spelled out therein—that \ngenuine constitutional desegregation can not be accomplished within the school district boundaries \nof the Detroit School District. \nThe record discloses that plaintiffs are proceeding with their efforts to establish the basis for a \nmetropolitan remedy within the Supreme Court's guidelines in Milliken v. Bradley.See memorandum \nand order of District Court dated December 19, 1975, 411 F.Supp. 937. Our limited affirmance and \nremand in this case is without prejudice to the obligation of the District Court to proceed with that \naspect of the litigation relating to the proposed metropolitan remedy. \nOn remand, the District Court will be empowered to make further alterations in the plan heretofore \nadopted by it, as the evidence may require, not inconsistent with this opinion. Kelley v. Metropolitan \nCity Board of Education, 463 F.2d 732, 744-45 (6th Cir. 1972),cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1001, 93 S.Ct. \n322, 34 L.Ed.2d 262 (1972). \nIII. Educational Components \nCiting the difficulties of the desegregation problems in Detroit, the District Court directed that the \nDetroit Board and the State put into effect certain comprehensive programs which were found to be \nessential to the success of the desegregation effort. The programs are referred to in the record as \n\"Educational Components.\" They include: (1) establishment of vocational centers; (2) a \ncomprehensive reading program; (3) an in-service training component designed to prepare faculty \nand other educational personnel to deal with new experiences that arise in a school system \n\nundergoing desegregation; (4) a testing component to insure that testing procedures are fair and \nequitable and have no discriminatory effects; (5) a uniform code of student conduct with provisions \nfor due process hearings; (6) a program of school community relations; (7) a program of counseling \nand career guidance; and (8) a monitoring system to audit efforts to implement the court's \ndesegregation efforts. Reference is made to those parts of the opinion of the District Court published \nat 402 F.Supp. 1138-45 dealing with these Educational Components. This opinion of the District \nCourt has been supplemented by additional orders. The Detroit Board of Education was required to \npay the highest amount previously allocated in its budget toward such programs. The remainder of \nthe cost would be paid one-half by the State of Michigan and one-half by the Detroit Board of \nEducation. \nOn May 11, 1976, the District Court entered a judgment implementing its program of Educational \nComponents. This judgment included the following: \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that: \nThe defendant Detroit Board of Education and the state defendants shall, on or before the start of \nthe September 1976 school term, institute comprehensive programs for: \na) Reading and communication skills \nb) In-service training \nc) Testing \nd) Counselling and career guidance. \n241*241 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Detroit Board shall disclose to the state defendants its \nhighest budget allocated in any year for each of these above-enumerated quality education \nprograms ordered herein, and thereafter the state defendants and the Detroit Board shall compute \nthe excess cost in addition thereto occasioned by the specific implementation of the court-ordered \nprograms, and the state defendants and the Detroit Board shall thereafter equally bear the burdens \nof such excess cost imposed by the provisions contained in this judgment and previous orders \ndirecting implementation of said educational components consistent with all orders and memoranda \nrelating thereto. \nThe Michigan State defendants appeal from the judgment of May 11, 1976, as to these four of the \nEducational Components, contending that there is no constitutional violation which justifies these \nremedies and that the District Judge exceeded his lawful authority by ordering the inclusion of these \nfour Educational Components in the remedy in this cause. The Detroit Board of Education, on the \nother hand, contends that all the Educational Components are within the scope of the equity powers \nof the court to remedy racial segregation in the Detroit schools because they help to eliminate \nvestiges of discrimination and because they are a necessary part of the long-range desegregation \nplan. \nThe District Court found that these Educational Components are necessary \"to remedy effects of \npast segregation, to assure a successful desegregation effort and to minimize the possibility of \nresegregation.\" 402 F.Supp. at 1118; May 11, 1976, order at page 3. This finding of fact is not clearly \nerroneous, but to the contrary is supported by ample evidence. \nThe need for in-service training of the educational staff and development of non-discriminatory \ntesting is obvious. The former is needed to insure that the teachers and administrators will be able to \nwork effectively in a desegregated environment. The latter is needed to insure that students are not \nevaluated unequally because of built-in bias in the tests administered in formerly segregated \nschools. \nWe agree with the District Court that the reading and counseling programs are essential to the effort \nto combat the effects of segregation. \n\nIn Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the \nSupreme Court said: \nSuch considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them \nfrom others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of \ninferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely \never to be undone. The effect of this separation on their educational opportunities was well stated by \na finding in the Kansas case by a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule against the Negro \nplaintiffs: \n\"Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the \ncolored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of \nseparating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of \ninferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, \nhas a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive \nthem of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system.\" \nWithout the reading and counseling components, black students might be deprived of the motivation \nand achievement levels which the desegregation remedy is designed to accomplish. \nAccordingly, we conclude that the findings of the District Court as to the Educational Components \nare supported by the record. This is not a situation where the District Court \"appears to have \nacted 242*242 solely according to its own notions of good educational policy unrelated to the \ndemands of the Constitution.\" See, Keyes v. School District, 521 F.2d 465, 483 (10th Cir. \n1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1066, 96 S.Ct. 806, 46 L.Ed.2d 657, 44 U.S.L.W. 3399 (1976). We \nhold that the District Court acted within its equity powers in requiring the Educational Components as \na part of the remedy. The decision of the District Court prescribing these components is affirmed. \nThe matter of allocation of the costs of these components will be dealt with in part IV of this opinion. \nIV. The Allocation of Costs as Between the State of \nMichigan and The Detroit Board of Education \nBoth the State defendants and the Detroit Board appeal from the judgment of the District Court \nrelative to the allocation of the costs of the Educational Components. The local Board also asserts \nthat the State should bear all the cost of 100 additional school buses. \nThe State defendants assert that the District Court may not, consistent with the eleventh \namendment, compel the State to pay for any part of the Educational Components. Reliance is \nplaced upon Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). \nEdelman did not involve payment of State funds \"as a necessary consequence of compliance in the \nfuture with a substantive federal-question determination\" or payments which became due at a time \nwhen required by a \"court-imposed obligation.\" At issue was a retroactive award of money relief \nwhich the Supreme Court found to be \"in practical effect indistinguishable in many aspects from an \naward of damages against the State.\" 415 U.S. at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358. The Supreme Court \nrecognized that under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 150, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 \n(1908), expenditure of State funds may be required by a prospective court decree without violating \nthe eleventh amendment, even if the relief has an ancillary effect on the State treasury. \nMr. Justice Rehnquist, speaking for the majority, said: \n\nThe injunction issued in Ex parte Young was not totally without effect on the State's revenues, since \nthe state law which the Attorney General was enjoined from enforcing provided substantial monetary \npenalties against railroads which did not conform to its provisions. Later cases from this Court have \nauthorized equitable relief which has probably had greater impact on state treasuries than did that \nawarded in Ex parte Young. In Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, [91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d \n534] (1971), Arizona and Pennsylvania welfare officials were prohibited from denying welfare \nbenefits to otherwise qualified recipients who were aliens. In Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, [90 \nS.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287] (1970), New York City welfare officials were enjoined from following \nNew York State procedures which authorized the termination of benefits paid to welfare recipients \nwithout prior hearing. But the fiscal consequences to state treasuries in these cases were the \nnecessary result of compliance with decrees which by their terms were prospective in nature. State \nofficials, in order to shape their official conduct to the mandate of the Court's decrees, would more \nlikely have to spend money from the state treasury than if they had been left free to pursue their \nprevious course of conduct. Such an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often \nan inevitable consequence of the principle announced in Ex parte Young, supra. (Footnote \nomitted.) 415 U.S. at 667-68, 94 S.Ct. at 1357. \nThe majority opinion recognized that the eleventh amendment would not apply \"where a federal \ncourt applies Ex parte Young to grant prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, as opposed to an \norder of retroactive payments . . .\" 415 U.S. at 666, n. 11, 94 S.Ct. at 1357. \nIn Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 \n(1974),the 243*243 Supreme Court, speaking through Chief Justice Burger, said: \nThe Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides: \"The Judicial power of \nthe United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or \nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State . . ..\" It is well established \nthat the Amendment bars suits not only against the State when it is the named party but also when it \nis the party in fact. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 [94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662] \n(1974); Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270, 287 [5 S.Ct. 903, 912, 29 L.Ed. 185] \n(1885); Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., 109 U.S. 446 [3 S.Ct. 292, 27 L.Ed. 992] (1883). \nIts applicability \"is to be determined not by the mere names of the titular parties but by the essential \nnature and effect of the proceeding, as it appears from the entire record.\" Ex parte New York, 256 \nU.S. 490, 500 [41 S.Ct. 588, 590, 65 L.Ed. 1057] (1921). \nHowever, since Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 [28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714] (1908), it has been \nsettled that the Eleventh Amendment provides no shield for a state official confronted by a claim that \nhe had deprived another of a federal right under the color of state law. Ex parte Young teaches that \nwhen a state officer acts under a state law in a manner violative of the Federal Constitution, he \n\"comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of \nhis official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his \nindividual conduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the \nsupreme authority of the United States.\" Id., [209 U.S.] at 159-160 [28 S.Ct. 441, at 454]. (Emphasis \nsupplied.) 416 U.S. at 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686. \nIn Wright v. Houston Independent School District, 393 F.Supp. 1149, 1158 (S.D.Tex. 1975), a school \ndesegregation case, the court placed the following construction upon Edelman: \nThe Supreme Court seems to be implying here that the situation is different if the state agency \nviolates a judicially mandated standard of action. In Edelman the state agency failed to live up to the \nstandards of a federal regulation, but invalidity of its actions had not yet been determined by a court \nof law. In the instant case, the Houston Independent School District has been ordered by the district \ncourt to conduct itself in a specified manner. It has not done so and this may have given rise to a \n\nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs herein with accompanying monetary damages. This difference \nin the circumstances may well make the case not subject to the Edelman decision. \nFor these reasons the court has determined that the eleventh amendment does not bar a money \njudgment for the plaintiffs. \nTo like effect see Morales v. Turman, 383 F.Supp. 53, 59-60 (E.D.Tex.1974). \nIn Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 4, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 1403, 3 L.Ed.2d 5 (1958), the Supreme Court said: \nAs this case reaches us it raises questions of the highest importance to the maintenance of our \nfederal system of government. It necessarily involves a claim by the Governor and Legislature of a \nState that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this Court's \nconsidered interpretation of the United States Constitution. Specifically it involves actions by the \nGovernor and Legislature of Arkansas upon the premise that they are not bound by our holding \nin Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873. \n* * * * * * \nThe principles announced in that decision and the obedience of the States to them, according to the \ncommand of the Constitution, are indispensable for the protection of the freedom guaranteed by our \nfundamental charter for all of us. 244*244 Our constitutional ideal of equal justice under law is thus \nmade a living truth. \nIn United States v. Board of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 503 F.2d 68, 80, 82 (7th Cir. \n1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 929, 95 S.Ct. 1654, 44 L.Ed.2d 86 (1975), the Seventh Circuit found an \naffirmative duty on Indiana state officials to assist in desegregating the Indianapolis school system. \nThe court said: \"The Eleventh Amendment does not prevent enforcement of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\" 503 F.2d at 82. \nIn Bradley v. Milliken, 484 F.2d at 258, this court said: \nIn the exercise of its equity powers, a District Court may order that public funds be expended, \nparticularly when such an expenditure is necessary to meet the minimum requirements mandated by \nthe Constitution. Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 233, 84 \nS.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed. 256 (1964); Eaton v. New Hanover County Board of Education, 459 F.2d 684 \n(4th Cir. 1972); Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, 456 F.2d 943, 947, 948 (4th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 406 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 1778, 32 L.Ed.2d 136 (1972); Plaquemines Parish School Board v. \nUnited States, 415 F.2d 817 (5th Cir. 1969). \nThe opinion of the Supreme Court reversing our decision in Bradley did not deal with this subject. \nWyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305, 1314-15 (5th Cir. 1974), involved an Alabama state school \ndesigned to rehabilitate the mentally retarded which was not being operated in a constitutional \nmanner. The State defendants in that case, the Governor, the Alabama Commissioner of Mental \nHealth and the Alabama Mental Health Board, like the State defendants in the present case, \nasserted that the federal court could not enter a judgment requiring the expenditure of State funds. \nJudge Wisdom responded to this contention as follows: \nThe appellants' fourth contention is that the order of the district court invades a province of decision-\nmaking exclusively reserved for the state legislature. Governor Wallace argues that the order will \nrequire heavy expenditures of state funds; that these funds will have to come from other state \nprograms; and that the duty of compromising and allocating funds among the many programs \ncompeting for them is a duty which must be discharged by the state governor and legislature alone. \nGovernor Wallace concedes in his brief that he is not contending that \"the financial cost of complying \n\nwith an established constitutional right is a valid reason for failure to comply\". He \"suggest[s] that \nbefore the Court decides to adopt a new constitutional right it should consider all of the \nconsequences of its action, financial and social, and its effect on our federal form of government\". \nThe Mental Health Board makes the point in a related way, by suggesting that the district court's \norder here is in effect an order requiring the state to furnish a particular service, and by citing cases \nestablishing the general proposition that ordinarily it is not for the federal courts to say whether or in \nwhat amounts a state shall provide any particular governmental benefit or service. E. g., Fullington v. \nShea, D.Colo.1970, 320 F.Supp. 500, aff'd, 404 U.S. 963, 92 S.Ct. 345, 30 L.Ed.2d 282. \nWe find these arguments unpersuasive. It goes without saying that state legislatures are ordinarily \nfree to choose among various social services competing for legislative attention and state funds. But \nthat does not mean that a state legislature is free, for budgetary or any other reasons, to provide a \nsocial service in a manner which will result in the denial of individuals' constitutional rights. And it is \nthe essence of our holding, here and in Donaldson, that the provision of treatment to those the state \nhas involuntarily confined in mental hospitals is necessary to make the state's actions in confining \nand continuing to confine those individuals constitutional. That being the case, the state may not fail \nto provide treatment for budgetary reasons alone. \"Humane considerations and constitutional \nrequirements are not, in this day, to be 245*245 measured or limited by dollar \nconsiderations\". Jackson v. Bishop, 8 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (Blackmun, J.), quoted, Rozecki \nv. Gaughan, 1 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 6, 8. \"Inadequate resources can never be an adequate \njustification for the state's depriving any person of his constitutional rights\". Hamilton v. \nLove,E.D.Ark.1972, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194. \"[T]he obligation of the Respondents [prison officials] \nto eliminate unconstitutionalities does not depend upon what the Legislatures may do\". Holt v. \nSarver, E.D.Ark. 1970, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385, aff'd, 8 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 304. See also Hawkins v. \nTown of Shaw, 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1286, 1292. 503 F.2d at 1314-15. \nThe decision of the District Court in the present case imposes no money judgment on the State of \nMichigan for past de jure segregation practices. Rather, the order is directed toward the State \ndefendants as a part of a prospective plan to comply with a constitutional requirement to eradicate \nall vestiges of de jure segregation. Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, \n20, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969). \nThe eleventh amendment contention of the State defendants is without merit. \nWe hold that it is within the equitable powers of the court to require the State of Michigan to pay a \nreasonable part of the cost of correcting the effects of de jure segregation which State officials, \nincluding the Legislature, have helped to create. We reemphasize that it is the law of this case that \nthe State of Michigan has been guilty of acts which have a causal relation to the de jure segregation \nthat exists in Detroit. See 484 F.2d at 238-41. \nThe State defendants have stipulated and agreed to an equal sharing of the costs of the acquisition \nand construction of the area vocational centers. This court has required the State defendants to bear \n75 per cent of the costs of acquiring 150 school buses. 6 Cir., 519 F.2d 679 (1975), cert. denied, 423 \nU.S. 930, 96 S.Ct. 280, 46 L.Ed.2d 258 (1975). The District Court ordered that the cost of acquiring \n100 additional school buses be shared on the same basis: i. e., that the buses be purchased by the \nDetroit Board, with the State bearing 75 per cent of the costs. \nOn May 11, 1976, the District Court ordered that the State and Detroit Board each pay one-half the \ncosts of the Educational Components. Both the State defendants and Detroit Board appeal from this \norder. The State defendants contend that the State should not be required to pay any of the cost of \nthese programs other than the normal share of State school aid funds provided to Detroit. The \nDetroit Board contends that any requirement that it bear the major financial responsibility for the plan \ndoes not result in \"balancing the individual and collective interests\" as required by Swann, 402 U.S. \n\nat 16. The Detroit Board asserts that this court should modify the order of the District Court so as to \nrequire the State defendants to pay at least 75 per cent of the total costs of the desegregation plan \nand 100 per cent of the costs of 100 additional school buses. \nSince Michigan State officers and agencies were guilty of acts which contributed substantially to the \nunlawful de jure segregation that exists in Detroit, the State has an obligation not only to eliminate \nthe unlawful segregation but also to insure that there is no diminution in the quality of education. This \nprinciple was stated in Hart v. Community School of Brooklyn, 383 F.Supp. 699 \n(E.D.N.Y.1974), aff'd, 512 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1975),wherein the court described the State's \nresponsibility in a desegregation plan as follows: \nAs part of the State's obligation to eliminate segregation, there is, of course, a concomitant obligation \nto ensure that there is no diminution in the quality of education . . .\" 383 F.Supp. at 741. \nIn Evans v. Buchanan, 379 F.Supp. 1218 (D.Del.1974), aff'd 423 U.S. 963, 96 S.Ct. 381, 46 L.Ed.2d \n293 (1975), reh. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S.Ct. 868, 47 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976),the court said: \nAccordingly, it is well established that to the extent that any schools in the State 246*246 are in \nviolation of Brown and its progeny or of this Court's orders, the State Board must bear primary \nresponsibility.\" 379 F.Supp. at 1222. \nThe fiscal justification for the decision of the District Court in requiring that the State of Michigan pay \none-half of the costs of the desegregation plan (to the extent specified in the orders and judgments) \nis supported abundantly by the evidence with respect to the critical financial problems now \nconfronting the Detroit Board of Education. The Board is operating on a \"survival budget\". The \nevidence is summarized in the brief of the Detroit Board, excerpts from which are set forth in the \nAppendix to this opinion. \nWe see no reason at this time for upsetting the judgment that the State of Michigan pay 50 percent \nof the costs of the desegregation plan to the extent prescribed by the District Court. We recognize, \nhowever, that it will be difficult for the Detroit Board to pay its share of the costs. (See Appendix.) \nOur affirmance of the District Court on this issue is not intended as a mandate for a cutback in \nessential educational programs in order to meet the expenses of implementing the desegregation \nplan. We affirm that part of the judgment relating to the costs of the plan, but without prejudice to the \nright of the District Court to require a larger proportionate payment by the State of Michigan if found \nto be required by future developments. \nOur previous order requiring the State to bear 75 per cent of the cost of 150 school buses is \nreaffirmed. The order of the District Court requiring the State to bear 75 per cent of the cost of the \n100 additional school buses is affirmed. \nV. Faculty Desegregation \nOriginally Judge DeMascio declined to order any reassignment of faculty in response to a proposal \nby the Detroit School Board that each Detroit school should have a teaching staff half white and half \nblack. On August 28, 1975, however, the District Court entered the following order: \nPursuant to this court's Memorandum Opinion and order dated August 15, 1975, this court's \nSupplemental Memorandum and Order dated August 18, 1975, and this court's Order dated August \n26, 1975; \n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that incidental to and concurrently with the implementation of the plan of \nstudent desegregation as hereafter ordered by the court, teachers in the Detroit School System shall \nbe reassigned insofar as necessary, and subject to collective bargaining agreement provisions \notherwise applicable and not inconsistent with this order, to achieve a distribution of not more than \n70% of teachers of one race in each school. \nThe Detroit Federation of Teachers, Intervenors, and the Detroit Board appeal from this order, taking \ndiametrically opposite positions. The teachers contend that it is the law of the case, under findings of \nfact by both Judge Roth and Judge DeMascio, that there has been no racially discriminatory \nassignment of Detroit faculty and that there is no lawful predicate for any faculty reassignment order \nbased on race. The Board contends that the court erred in rejecting a 50-50 ratio proposed in the \noriginal Board plan. It is asserted that adherence to the District Court's 70 per cent figure has caused \nthe Board to be out of compliance with 45 C.F.R. § 185.44(d)(3), thus preventing the Detroit school \nsystem from receiving funds under the Emergency School Aid Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1602 (Supp. II, \n1972).[5] \nAdditionally, the Detroit Board contends that the District Court erroneously ruled as inadmissible: (1) \ntestimony that the balance of staff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement have not \nbrought about the anticipated racial ratios of teachers in individual schools; (2) testimony that \nteacher transfers were necessary when students 247*247 were reassigned, grade structures \nchanged and schools closed; and (3) testimony that the racial ratio of teachers must be changed in \norder to qualify for federal funds. \nThe State defendants support the position of the teachers. The plaintiffs support the position of the \nBoard. \nWe reject the contention of the intervenors that the order of Judge Roth, entered in 1971, deprives \nthe Board of Education or the court of power to reassign teachers in 1976. Cf., Swann, 402 U.S. 1, \n16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Keyes v. School District,521 F.2d 465, 484 (10th Cir. \n1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1066, 96 S.Ct. 806, 46 L.Ed.2d 657 (1976); see also, Morgan v. \nKerrigan, 509 F.2d 580, 595 (1st Cir. 1974),aff'g, 379 F.Supp. 410 (D.Mass. 1974), cert. denied, 421 \nU.S. 963, 95 S.Ct. (1975). \nIt is significant that Judge Roth's order of June 14, 1972 (dealing with a contemplated metropolitan \nremedy), 345 F.Supp. 914, 931, 938, made provisions for reassignment of faculty. \nThe reassignment of faculty is similar to the reading and counseling \"Educational Components\" \nwhich we have upheld in Part III of this opinion. It helps to mitigate the fact that the majority of \nDetroit's children are left in schools that are overwhelmingly one race. Reassignment of faculty \nserves to provide these children with the maximum desegregative experience possible under the \ncircumstances. \nIn fashioning a desegregation remedy which involves reassignment of faculty it is obvious that, if \notherwise feasible, a District Court should leave a school system in compliance with applicable \nfederal regulations. We express no views in this opinion as to whether the above quoted August 28 \norder of the District Court disqualifies the Detroit school system from receiving aid.[6] This question is \nnot before us. \nAlthough the District Court has the authority as an equitable remedy to order the reassignment of \nfaculty, we conclude that further consideration should be given to this issue. Accordingly, we vacate \nthe above-quoted order of the District Court, dated August 28, 1975, and remand this aspect of the \ncase to the District Court for the hearing of the evidence on the issue of faculty assignment. \n\nVI. Conclusion \nThe case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \nNo costs are taxed. Each party will bear his own costs on this appeal. \nAPPENDIX \nFinancially, the Detroit school system has been devastated by a series of compounding economic \ncrises. The period between 1970 and 1976 has marked an all-time low in the system's ability to \nabsorb and compensate for the costs of educating Detroit's children. \nThe cost of education is a function of the size of a school district. (TR. Vol. 7 at 110-111). The Detroit \nsystem is the largest school district in the State and encompasses the largest number of indigent \nstudents in Michigan. (TR. Vol. 25 at 88). The cost of providing educational services in Detroit has \ngone up disproportionately to the continuing above-state average drop in school enrollment. (TR. \nVol. 24 at 131). This cost increase reflects the additional cost of doing business, without improving \neducational services. (TR. Vol. 24 at 125-126; Vol. 7 at 85-86). \nActually, since 1971, the Detroit school system has experienced severe financial crisis as a result of \nthe loss of property tax revenues by virtue of urban renewal and highway construction; the exodus of \nbusiness and industries to the suburbs and the concomitant outward population flow from the city. \n(TR. Vol. 7 at 92). At the same time, the system was experiencing escalating educational costs \nforcing the Board into a \"survival\" budget under which the system was forced to provide only minimal \neducational services while eliminating many crucial educational programs. \n248*248 By 1973, the system had accumulated a 68 million dollar deficit and was within four days of \nclosing its doors due to the lack of funds. (TR. Vol. 7 at 82). As a result of special state legislation, \nthe Detroit system was able to finance its debt over a period of years and continue operations \nutilizing a portion of the operating budget for repayment. However, by law the Detroit Board was \nrequired to operate within a balanced budget which has necessitated a continuation of the \"survival\" \nbudget instituted in 1971. \nThe Detroit school system is financed by property taxes as allocated by the Wayne County Tax \nAllocation Board and as voted by the electors of the school district, by declining State Aid supplied \nby the state legislature based upon the number of students in the school district and the State \nEqualized Value (SEV) of property in the district and by special funds from the Michigan legislature \nand from federal sources. (TR. Vol. 7 at 87-90, 93, 95, 105; Vol. 25 at 106-107; Detroit Board Ex. 42 \nand 43). State Aid comprised approximately 47% of the total 1974-75 budget and federal funding \nprovided approximately 15% of that budget. The Detroit Board does not have the power nor the \nauthority to levy an income tax to finance school operations, nor can the Board levy additional \nmillage without a favorable vote of the electorate. (TR. Vol. 7 at 86; Vol. 24 at 151, 157; Vol. 26 at \n20). \nDetroit's municipal tax overburden is a function of its size and the result of the many municipal \nservices provided by Detroit which are not provided or required by other municipalities but which are \nutilized by citizens of the entire southeastern Michigan area. \nOver the past five years, Detroit's SEV has remained relatively static compared to the increasing \nSEV of the rest of the State. The School Aid Act provides a power equalizing formula to supply a \nmore uniform flow of State revenue to school districts to remedy the widely variant per pupil SEV. \n\nThe per capita SEV in Detroit is 50% lower than the average for the 20 largest cities in Michigan, \nthus requiring more millage to be levied by Detroit taxpayers to obtain an equal yield. (TR. Vol. 7 at \n105; Detroit Board Ex. 31). \nThe municipal overburden inequities have been recognized by the State and school aid is supplied \nschool districts whose municipal overburden is in excess of 125% of the state average. [Bursley Act, \nM.C.L.A. § 388.1225; M.S.A. § 15.1919(525)]. While the power equalizing membership section of \nthe Act, in which all qualifying school districts can share, is fully funded, the municipal overburden \nsection of the Act is presently funded by only approximately 28% of the total amount authorized. \nDetroit, with the greatest overburden in the State, presently receives 91% of the allocated funds in \nthe overburden section of the Act pursuant to the formula. \nIf the overburden section were fully funded, the Detroit system would receive an additional 61.6 \nmillion dollars. If it were funded by 50% (as was done in 1972-73), the system would receive an \nadditional 18.7 million dollars more than is presently received. It is clear that the State does not \nprovide the Detroit Board with all the money in State aid which it should or could. \nOn July 1, 1975, the Central Board of Education adopted a 1975-76 general fund-general purpose \nbudget in the amount of $310,231,253. The budget as adopted was a balanced budget based upon \nprojected revenue and anticipated expenditures. However, total anticipated revenues from state, \nlocal and federal sources were short of meeting expenditure requirements by $4,691,496. In order to \nbalance the budget at $310,231,253 an allocation of $4,691,496 was required from prior year \ngeneral fund equity to close the gap between revenues and expenditures. \nThe 1975-76 budget is essentially a continuation of the inadequate level of educational services of \nthe past several years. In January, the Detroit Board cut close to $17 million from its budget for the \nsecond half of the school year. Annualized, this cut amounted to about $34 million. At the time, this \nwas close to 15% of the Board's 249*249 general purpose budget. In addition, emergency cuts of \n$10.7 million were instituted during the 1973-74 school year. Annualized savings from these said \nyear cuts are about $20 million. Detroit has not been able to restore the programs and services \neliminated or curtailed as a result of these further budget cuts. \nExpenditures have been reduced and postponed each year since 1971. The cumulative effects of \npast cutbacks have already begun to have serious consequences for educational programs. \nContinuing these cuts merely compounds the damage. Each year it becomes more costly to restore \nthese services because of the inflationary spiral. For those students who have left the system, it is \nalready too late to have any effect regardless of cost. \nSubsequent to adoption of the 1975-76 budget, state aid revenue which had been originally \nestimated at $159,318,160 were reduced to $152,467,601 as a result of decreases in the municipal \noverburden allocation to Detroit, a .6% statutory reduction, a 1.7% executive order reduction, and \nvarious other state aid adjustments. In order to maintain school programs and services, the \n$6,850,559 reduction in state aid was replaced from prior year general fund equity. \nIn addition, a number of supplemental budget allocations were required in 1975-76 to meet \nmandatory operating costs in such areas as transportation, bilingual/bicultural programs and building \noperation and maintenance. Based upon the total supplemental appropriations and replacement of \nstate aid revenue losses, the Detroit school district faces a potential budgetary deficit of \napproximately $5,700,000 in 1975-76. The general fund equity accumulated from prior years will be \ncompletely exhausted. \n\nEstimated general fund-general purpose expenditure requirements for 1976-77 are approximately \n$336 million.[1] This estimated level of expenditure reflects only the increased cost of doing business \nin 1976-77 at the same level of services as 1975-76. The increases in cost are of a nondiscretionary \nnature and include negotiated salary adjustments and increments of $20,000,000, inflationary \nincreases of $4,500,000, and a contingency for unanticipated charges equal to 1% of the total \nbudget or $3,360,000. Except for those desegregation components implemented this year, i. e., pupil \ntransportation and bilingual/bicultural, no provision has been made for desegregation costs. \nWith regard to projected reserve, there is a potential gap of over $37 million between estimated \n1976-77 expenditure requirements and current year reserve estimates. This gap will have to be \nclosed by reducing the projected level of expenditure through an additional cutback in educational \nprograms and services and/or increasing revenues. If additional revenues are not obtained from \nlocal or state sources, existing programs and services would have to be cut by up to $37 million to \nbalance the 1976-77 budget. If a deficit is incurred in 1975-76, that amount would also have to be \nincluded as part of the budget cuts required in 1976-77. \nAt least three state aid bills are currently before the legislature. It is unlikely that the state will fund \nany appreciable increase in state aid for 1976-77. Consequently, at best, state revenues for next \nyear will be at the same level as in 1975-76. \nThe record reflects, and the District Court so found, that there is no possibility of the citizens of \nDetroit voting additional millage for operation of the school system in the near future. Detroit \ntaxpayers shoulder the highest tax burden in the State. (TR. Vol. 24 at 146-147; Detroit Board Ex. \n30, 41). Additionally, Detroit taxpayers have the highest municipal tax overburden in Michigan. (TR. \nVol. 7 at 104, 109-114; Vol. 24 at 147; Detroit Board Ex. 33). Detroiters pay a 28.58% higher \nproperty tax rate than the State average. (TR. Vol. 24 at 146; Detroit Board Ex. 41). Of the past eight \nmillage elections for additional revenue, seven have failed and a reasonable 250*250 expectation is \nthat no additional millage will be voted in the near future. (TR. Vol. 24 at 143-144, 147, 150-151; Vol. \n7 at 140, 144; Detroit Board Ex. 40). \nNotwithstanding this dismal prediction by the District Court, the Detroit Board plans to place a \nmillage proposal before the electorate of the City of Detroit for a 3 mill tax to maintain existing \nprograms and a 2 mill tax for modest improvements (App. at 35a) in a desperate attempt to increase \nrevenues for the 1976-77 school year. This millage proposal was preceded by a recent vote of the \nelectorate which increased taxes to finance a court ordered construction of a new jail facility. Again, \nthe immediate tax burden of Detroit residents has been increased, and the Detroit Board's request \nmust follow closely on the heels of this recent tax burden increase. Additionally, the legislature and \nthe City Council have just voted a 3 mill garbage tax. Similarly, City of Detroit property owners will \npay a 2-2.5 mill tax increase for City debt retirement (App. at 35a). \nIn light of all the above, the financial impact of implementing the District Court's adopted \ndesegregation plan is readily apparent upon a cursory review of the relevant orders of the District \nCourt between August 15, 1975, and May 11, 1976. \nOn August 15, 1975, the District Court (App. at 1a-15a) ordered, exclusive of transportation costs, \nthe establishment of four vocational centers; formulation of two additional technical high schools \npatterned after Cass Tech; institution of comprehensive programs for a) in-service training, b) bi-\nlingual/multi-ethnic studies, c) counseling and career guidance, d) testing, and e) co-curricular \nactivities; equalization of all school facilities and buildings; and comprehensive construction and \nrestoration programs. \n\nOn October 29, 1975 (App. at 16a-19a), the District Court ordered the Detroit Board to devise an in-\nservice training program for all school personnel to provide instruction in the \"fair, non-\ndiscriminatory\" administration of the Student Code of Conduct; and an in-service training program for \nthe reading program. \nLater, on November 10, 1975 (App. at 20a-22a), the District Court ordered the Detroit Board and the \nState Defendants to jointly identify and acquire suitable sites for five vocational centers and take \nsteps to construct such sites as soon as possible; and the in-service training of reading instructors. \nOn December 4, 1975 (App. at 25a-26a), the District Court ordered implementation of the Detroit \nBoard's October 8, 1975, proposal for a reading instruction program, including in-service training of \nall instructors. \nOn January 14, 1976 (App. at 27a-29a), the District Court ordered the institution of the Detroit \nBoard's Modernization Program. \nFinally, on May 11, 1976 (App. at 30a-34a), the District Court ordered equalization of all school \nfacilities and buildings preparatory to the 1976-77 school term; continuance of the comprehensive \nconstruction and renovation program; the institution of a reading and communication skills program, \ntogether with the necessary in-service training therefore; the institution of the testing program with \nthe accompanying in-service training; institution of the counseling and career guidance program with \nthe accompanying in-service training; the application of a formula for equal sharing of excess cost of \nimplementing the educational components by the Detroit Board and the State Defendants; institution \nof the vocational education program; institution of a comprehensive program for bi-lingual/multi-\nethnic studies; and institution of the in-service training program for implementation of the Uniform \nCode of Conduct. \nEven without actual dollar figures, the financial impact of these orders could easily destroy the \neducational program of the Detroit school system. The financing of these components by the Detroit \nschool system would only mean a concomitant elimination of existing programs. \n251*251 It is virtually impossible for the Detroit Board of Education to re-order its priorities when it is \nalready operating on a woefully inadequate budget that cannot provide a minimal quality educational \nprogram. Any attempt to redistribute available resources will cause further deterioration in on-going \neducational programs and will merely result in robbing Peter to pay Paul. \nNevertheless, the school district is required by law to adopt a balanced budget by July 1. In order to \ndo so, expenditure requirements will have to be reduced to the level of expected revenue. This will \nmean a drastic cut in existing programs and services. The school district will not even be able to \nmaintain current levels of educational programming; therefore, it would certainly be a futile gesture to \nconsider funding the increased costs of implementing desegregation components. \nThe May 11, 1976, Judgment appealed presents a highly structured and effective desegregation \nplan. However, the Judgment fails to establish a satisfactory financing scheme to properly and \nequitably dispense the costs of underwriting such a plan. \n[1] The charts submitted by the Detroit Board show the Clinton School to be 100 per cent black. \n[2] The findings are quoted in full at 484 F.2d 242-45. \n[3] The interlocutory decisions of Judge Roth, which were affirmed by this court, have been misunderstood and reported \nerroneously. It has been said that Judge Roth ordered, and this court approved, the consolidation of the Detroit School \n\nDistrict with 53 suburban school districts, or that Judge Roth established a desegregation panel and ordered it to prepare a \nremedial plan consolidating the Detroit system and 53 suburban school districts. Such reports are incorrect. See, e. g., Hills \nv. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d 792, 44 U.S.L.W. at 4480 (1976). We have found nothing in any \nopinion or order of Judge Roth evidencing any intention to consolidate any school districts. He apparently contemplated a \nremedy which would have left the suburban districts intact but would have involved one or more of them in a metropolitan \nplan of pupil transportation. \nMoreover, this court never indicated an intention to require the consolidation of any school districts. The interlocutory order \naffirmed by us merely created a panel \"charged with the responsibility of preparing and submitting an effective \ndesegregation plan.\" So far as the record shows, this panel never made a report. It is reemphasized that no specific plan of \ndesegregation was ever adopted by Judge Roth or approved by this court. \nApparently there has been confusion between this case and Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond,462 F.2d 1058 \n(4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by an equally divided court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (1973), where the District Court \nordered the consolidation of three separate Virginia school districts. \nThis court distinguished the Detroit case from the Richmond case in the following language: \nBradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by an equally divided court, 412 U.S. \n92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (1973), is distinguishable in several respects. In that case the District Court ordered an \nactual consolidation of three separate school districts, all of which the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared to be \nunitary. In the instant case the District Court has not ordered consolidation of school districts, but directed a study of plans \nfor the reassignment of pupils in school districts comprising the metropolitan area of Detroit. In the Richmond case the court \nfound that neither the Constitution nor statutes of Virginia, previously or presently in effect, would have permitted the State \nBoard of Education, acting alone, to have effected a consolidation of the three school districts into a single system under the \ncontrol of a single school board. The Fourth Circuit held that compulsory consolidation of political subdivisions of the State of \nVirginia was beyond the power of a federal court because of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \nThe decisions which now are under review did not contemplate such a restructuring. \nFurthermore, the court in the Richmond case cited provisions of the Constitution and statutes of Virginia in support of its \nholding that— \n\"The power to operate, maintain and supervise public schools in Virginia is, and always has been, within the exclusive \njurisdiction of the local school boards and not within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education.\" 462 F.2d at 1067. \nThe record in the present case amply supports the finding that the State of Michigan has not been subject to such limitations \nin its dealings with local school boards. 484 F.2d at 250-51. \n[4] In an order dated June 19, 1975, published at 6 Cir., 519 F.2d 679, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 930, 96 S.Ct. 280, 46 L.Ed.2d \n258 (1975), this court modified and affirmed the order of the District Court requiring the purchase of 150 school buses. We \ndirected that the Detroit School Board acquire the buses and that the State defendants bear the costs of acquisition to the \nextent of 75 per cent thereof. On October 8, 1975, the District Court ordered the Detroit Board of Education to acquire 100 \nadditional buses, with 75 per cent of the costs to be paid by the State. \n[5] The Emergency School Act makes no distinction between de jure and de facto segregation. 20 U.S.C. § 1602(b). \n[6] See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-5 (1970). \n[1] This compares with 310.2 million dollars in 1975-1976. There will be no general fund equity to supplement any increases. \n ",

Milliken, et al. \nBefore EDWARDS, Chief Judge, and PHILLIPS and PECK, Senior Circuit Judges. \nHARRY PHILLIPS, Senior Circuit Judge. \nOn July 25, 1974, the Supreme Court remanded this case to the district court for \"prompt formulation \nof a decree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy \nwhich has been delayed since 1970.\" Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 753, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3131, 41 \nL.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (Milliken I). Nearly six years have elapsed since that remand, and almost ten \nyears since this litigation began, yet we are unable to hold on the record before us that de jure \nsegregation has been eliminated from the Detroit school system. We conclude that we must send \nthe case back to the district court for further proceedings. \nThe present appeal presents four questions for decision: (1) Did the district court err in holding that \npopulation and demographic changes in Detroit have obliterated all traces and effects of past acts of \ndiscrimination by the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan? Part II of this opinion rejects \nthe ruling of the district court as contrary to the law of this case and clearly erroneous. (2) Was the \ndistrict court correct in holding that the overwhelming percentage of black students in the Detroit \nschool system precludes including in the pupil assignment plan any of the schools in the three inner-\ncity regions of the school district? Part III of this opinion concludes the district court's holding was \nerror, and outlines the standards to be applied by the district court when it reconsiders inner-city \n\npupil reassignment on remand. (3) Was it error for the district court to order additional pupil \nreassignments between schools in Regions 1 and 2? Part IV of the opinion affirms in principle the \npropriety of additional pupil reassignments, but remands the case for a hearing on the question \nwhether Hispanic students should be treated as white for desegregation purposes. (4) Did District \nJudge Robert 1145*1145 E. DeMascio abuse his discretion in declining to recuse himself from the \nremand proceedings in this case? Part V finds no abuse of discretion, but suggests, in view of the \nbitter feelings that have developed, that the case be reassigned to another judge on remand from \nthis court's decision on the present appeal. \nI. \nThis protracted litigation began in 1970. On April 7 of that year, the Detroit Board voluntarily adopted \na modest plan to desegregate some of the Detroit high schools. The State legislature, however, \nblocked implementation of that plan by enacting § 12 of Act No. 48, Public Acts of 1970. A citizen-\ninitiated recall election resulted in the replacement of the four Board members who had favored the \nApril 7 plan, and the reconstituted Board rescinded the plan. \nThe plaintiffs filed this suit on August 18, 1970, alleging that § 12 of Act No. 48 was unconstitutional \nand praying for a preliminary injunction requiring the Board to implement the April 7 plan. The late \nDistrict Judge Stephen J. Roth denied plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction and they \nappealed. This court held § 12 of Act No. 48 unconstitutional, but affirmed the denial of a preliminary \ninjunction and remanded for a trial on the merits. 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir. 1970). On remand, Judge \nRoth again refused to grant a preliminary injunction, and this court affirmed, again directing a trial on \nthe merits. 438 F.2d 945 (6th Cir. 1971). \nThe case was tried on the issue of segregation from April 6, 1971 to July 22, 1971. On September \n27, 1971, Judge Roth issued his ruling on the issue of segregation, finding both the State of \nMichigan and the Detroit Board[1] had committed \"acts which have been causal factors in the \nsegregated condition of the public schools in the City of Detroit,\" 338 F.Supp. 582, 592 (E.D.Mich. \n1971). \nJudge Roth determined that true desegregation could not be accomplished within the geographical \nlimits of Detroit. Distributing the relatively small number of white students remaining in the district \nthroughout the schools, he held, would render the entire system identifiably black. Accordingly, he \nordered the defendants to submit metropolitan plans for desegregation. 345 F.Supp. 914 \n(E.D.Mich.1972). \nThis court, sitting en banc, affirmed both the finding of de jure segregation and the propriety of an \ninterdistrict remedy. 484 F.2d 215 (6th Cir. 1973). \nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed in part. The Court held the district court had no \nequitable power to include in its remedial decree any school district whose racial composition had \nnot been shown to be the product of de jure segregation. The defendants did not, however, \nchallenge the district court's finding of de jure segregation within the city of Detroit. Accordingly, the \nCourt remanded the case for formulation of a Detroit-only remedial decree. 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. \n3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974)(Milliken I). \nJudge Roth had died shortly before the Supreme Court issued its opinion, and District Judge Robert \nE. DeMascio was assigned the difficult task of formulating a decree which would eliminate the \neffects of de jure segregation from the Detroit school system without transgressing the limits set by \nthe Supreme Court in Milliken I. Judge DeMascio required the parties to submit desegregation plans, \n\nbut rejected them as unsatisfactory. His August 15, 1975 opinion, reported at 402 F.Supp. 1096 \n(E.D.Mich. 1975), established guidelines to be met by an acceptable remedial plan. Hereafter, they \nare referred to as the August 15 guidelines. \nOn November 4, 1975, Judge DeMascio adopted a desegregation plan drafted by 1146*1146the \nDetroit Board in an effort to conform to the August 15 guidelines. 411 F.Supp. 943 (E.D.Mich.1975). \nThis plan provided for changes in pupil assignments in five of the eight administrative regions of the \nDetroit school district, excluding inner-city Regions 1, 5 and 8 which are overwhelmingly black. In \naddition, the remedial decree provided for various Educational Components, requiring establishment \nof certain training, remedial, testing, counseling, monitoring and public relations programs. \nThis court affirmed the remedial decree's Educational Components and the portion of the pupil \nreassignment plan that required reassignments within Regions 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. We found that \nexcluding Regions 1, 5 and 8 from the pupil reassignment plan left approximately 83,000 students \nwith no relief from unconstitutional de jure segregation. Moreover, we noted, these three Regions \nare in the area most affected by the previously found illegal acts. This being the case, the Board had \nassumed the burden of showing that the segregation existing in Regions 1, 5 and 8, which were \nexcluded from the plan, was not the result of the defendants' present or past discriminatory actions. \nSince the record disclosed no adequate justification for limiting the pupil reassignment plan to five \nRegions, we remanded the case for further consideration in regard to schools located in the inner-\ncity Regions. 540 F.2d 229 (6th Cir. 1976). \nThe Supreme Court affirmed the propriety of the decree's Educational Components, and their validity \nno longer is an issue in this case. Neither the district court's pupil reassignment plan nor this court's \npartial reversal was challenged in the Supreme Court, and it had no occasion to rule thereon. 433 \nU.S. 267, 279, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2756, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977) (Milliken II). \nBefore the district court commenced remand proceedings, the plaintiffs moved Judge DeMascio to \nrecuse himself from the case. Relying on 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) and Canon 3A(4) of the Code of \nJudicial Conduct, the plaintiffs complained that Judge DeMascio had created an appearance of \npartiality by engaging in ex parte contacts with experts, community groups and the Detroit Board in \nthe process of developing his desegregation guidelines and remedial decree. Judge DeMascio \ndeclined to recuse himself. 426 F.Supp. 929 (E.D.Mich.1977). However, he referred to the Chief \nJudge of the District the question whether his prior conferences with the Detroit Board and the \nteachers' union aimed at averting a strike, coupled with his August 28, 1975, order directing faculty \nreassignments, had created the appearance that he had prejudged the faculty assignment issue. On \nreferral from the Chief Judge, District Judge James P. Churchill agreed with Judge DeMascio that \nrecusal was not required. 426 F.Supp. at 943-44. \nOn the merits, Judge DeMascio reaffirmed his prior conclusion that Regions 1, 5 and 8 need not and \ncannot be included in the pupil reassignment plan. 460 F.Supp. 299 (E.D.Mich.1978). He held that \npronounced demographic shifts, together with the predominance of the black student population, \nhave obliterated the effects of defendants' prior acts of de jure segregation. Current residential \npatterns, not school assignments, he said, account for the one-race character of the inner-city \nschools. Accordingly, Judge DeMascio held that the present assignment pattern is free from the \nvestiges of prior discrimination and that the Board had borne its heavy burden of justifying the \nexclusion of the inner-city regions from the pupil reassignment plan. 460 F.Supp. at 307-08. \nNevertheless, the court found there were some white students available in Region 2 to desegregate \ncertain Region 1 schools. The Board objected that many of these white students were Spanish \ndominant Hispanics involved in bilingual educational programs that would be disrupted by additional \npupil reassignments. However, Judge DeMascio felt this court's opinion mandated whatever \n\nreassignments were possible, despite any burden on bilingual programs. 460 F.Supp. at 312. In a \nsupplemental opinion, Judge DeMascio ordered the Detroit Board to develop a plan for reassigning \npupils between Regions 1 and 2 which 1147*1147 would provide for bilingual education in receiving \nschools. On November 11, 1978, the court adopted the Board's responsive plan. 460 F.Supp. 325 \n(E.D.Mich.1978). \nThe Detroit Board appeals on the ground that the district court exceeded its authority by ordering \nadditional pupil reassignments between Regions 1 and 2. The plaintiffs cross-appeal from Judge \nDeMascio's decision not to recuse himself, his holding that demographic changes have obliterated \nthe effects of defendants' prior discriminatory acts, and his conclusion that Regions 1, 5 and 8 were \nproperly excluded from the pupil reassignment plan. This court stayed implementation of the \nadditional reassignment plan pending the outcome of this appeal. \nII \nThe first question we address is whether Judge DeMascio was correct when he decided that \ndemographic changes and the growth of the Detroit school system's proportion of black students \nhave obliterated the effects of defendants' past discriminatory actions. We conclude that this holding \nof the district court is refuted overwhelmingly by the record. \nJudge DeMascio's conclusion apparently was based on his belief that the only effect of defendants' \npast discriminatory actions was to allow white students to escape from integrated schools in racially \nchanging residential areas: \nThis was so because the actions which formed the basis for Judge Roth's liability findings were \nbasically reactions by the Detroit Board of Education to changing residential patterns. The optional \nand gerrymandered attendance zones served the purpose of keeping white students out of schools \nthat, in the absence of such policies, would have become, and in fact have become, integrated \nnaturally. Judge Roth did not find, however, that these policies in turn created additional residential \nsegregation which in turn created additional school segregation. Had he made such findings, and \nhad such findings been supported in the record, we assume the Supreme Court would have affirmed \nthe propriety of an interdistrict remedy. \n460 F.Supp. at 307-08. \nAccordingly, Judge Demascio thought the defendants' actions could have had only temporary \nsegregative effects, effects that had been nullified by the almost total displacement of whites from \nformerly integrated neighborhoods: \nThese pronounced demographic shifts, first predicted by Judge Roth, and the predominance of the \nblack student population have obliterated the optional and gerrymandered attendance zones which \npermitted white students to avoid attending integrated schools, the practice of bussing black \nstudents from overcrowded schools beyond a closer white school and the practice of altering feeder \npatterns in racially changing neighborhoods. \n(Footnote omitted.) 460 F.Supp. at 307. \nThe problem with this conclusion of the district court is that it is contrary to the law of this case as \nestablished by Judge Roth and affirmed by this court and by the Supreme Court in Milliken I. \nJudge Roth found that the Detroit Board had done at least four things to maintain a dual school \nsystem in Detroit: First, during the 1950's, the Board \"created and maintained optional attendance \nzones in neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high school attendance areas of \n\nopposite predominant racial compositions.\" 338 F.Supp. at 587. \"The natural, probable, foreseeable \nand actual effect of these optional zones was to allow white youngsters to escape identifiably `black' \nschools.\" Id. Second, the Board \"admittedly bused black pupils past or away from closer white \nschools with available space to black schools,\" but only in one instance, necessitated by the burning \nof a white school, did the Board bus white children to a black school. 338 F.Supp. at 588. Third, the \nBoard \"created and altered attendance zones, . . . grade structures and . . . feeder school patterns in \na manner which . . . [maintained] black and white pupils in racially segregated \nschools.\" Id. Finally, 1148*1148 by constructing many small schools and locating new schools in \nareas of one race, the Board negated opportunities to integrate, contained the black population, and \ncompounded school segregation. Id. \nThe plaintiffs presented evidence that the Board's discriminatory actions affected not only schools \nbut residential patterns. For example, in affirming Judge Roth's finding of de jure segregation, this \ncourt quoted the following exchange between plaintiffs' counsel and Dr. Gordon Foster of the \nUniversity of Miami, director of the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center, concerning \noptional attendance zones: \n\"Q. Doctor Foster, from your examination of the 1950 census and in turn the 1960 census exhibits, \ndo you have an opinion as the effect of such an optional zone on the community residence pattern in \nthe community? \n* * * * * * \n\"A. Community people and residents in a situation such as this generally have a perception that \nthere is something wrong with their school, that the whites need an optional zone to get out into a \nless black situation and, therefore, this increases their perception of racial isolation and, in fact, \nphysical containment. \n\"Q. Does this have an effect, Doctor, in terms of the residence pattern? I believe you testified in 1950 \nthe optional area was entirely white or zero to 4.9 per cent white. \n* * * * * * \n\"A. In my opinion this tends to increase the instability of the community because they generally feel \nthis is an ad hoc temporary interim situation and it increases white flight in this sort of situation. \n484 F.2d at 234. \nAt another point, Dr. Foster testified that locating new schools in one race areas rather than \nintegrated areas tends to isolate the new school's attendance zone and perpetuate its racial identity. \n484 F.2d at 238. \nResponding to this and other evidence, Judge Roth found the Board's discriminatory policies were \npartially responsible for segregated residential patterns: \nGovernmental actions and inaction at all levels, federal, state and local, have combined, with those \nof private organizations, such as loaning institutions and real estate associations and brokerage \nfirms, to establish and to maintain the pattern of residential segregation throughout the Detroit \nmetropolitan area. \n. . . [A]ll of them, including the school authorities, are, in part, responsible for the segregated \ncondition which exists. And we note that just as there is an interaction between residential patterns \nand the racial composition of the schools, so there is a corresponding effect on the residential \npattern by the racial composition of the schools. \n338 F.Supp. at 587. \nSee also Judge Roth's seventh conclusion of law, 338 F.Supp. at 593. \nIn affirming Judge Roth's findings on the issue of segregation, we stated: \n\nThis record contains a substantial volume of testimony concerning local and State action and \npolicies which helped produce residential segregation in Detroit and in the metropolitan area of \nDetroit. In affirming the District Judge's findings of constitutional violations by the Detroit Board of \nEducation and by the State defendants resulting in segregated schools in Detroit, we have not relied \nat all upon testimony pertaining to segregated housing except as school construction programs \nhelped cause or maintain such segregation. \n484 F.2d at 242 (emphasis supplied). \nSee also Milliken I supra, 418 U.S. at 724 and 728 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. at 3117 and 3119 n. 7 \n(acknowledging Judge Roth's and this court's partial reliance on de jure school segregation as one \ncause of residential segregation). \nMoreover, Judge Roth's conclusion that present Detroit housing patterns reflect the Board's past \ndiscrimination accords with the analysis of the Supreme Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 20-21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971): \n1149*1149 The construction of new schools and the closing of old ones are two of the most \nimportant functions of local school authorities and also two of the most complex. They must decide \nquestions of location and capacity in light of population growth, finances, land values, site \navailability, through an almost endless list of factors to be considered. The result of this will be a \ndecision which, when combined with one technique or another of student assignment, will determine \nthe racial composition of the student body in each school in the system. Over the long run, the \nconsequences of the choices will be far reaching. People gravitate toward school facilities, just as \nschools are located in response to the needs of people. The location of schools may thus influence \nthe patterns of residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on \ncomposition of inner-city neighborhoods. \nIn the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or maintaining a \nstate-segregated school system. In addition to the classic pattern of building schools specifically \nintended for Negro or white students, school authorities have sometimes, since Brown [v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873], closed schools which appeared likely to \nbecome racially mixed through changes in neighborhood residential patterns. This was sometimes \naccompanied by building new schools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro \npopulation centers in order to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum departure from \nthe formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\" Such a policy does more than simply influence the \nshort-run composition of the student body of a new school. It may well promote segregated \nresidential patterns which, when combined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the school \nsystem into the mold of separation of the races. Upon a proper showing a district court may consider \nthis in fashioning a remedy. \nSee also Adams v. United States, 620 F.2d 1277, 1290, 1291 (8th Cir. 1980) (massive demographic \nshifts that have rendered the St. Louis school district 75 per cent black have incorporated rather than \nwiped out the segregative effects of the system's prior de jure discriminatory policies: \"public \nperception of the racial identity of a school can be, and often is, a powerful factor in shaping the \nresidential patterns of a neighborhood\"). \nIn Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973),the Supreme \nCourt held that the discriminatory practices of a school district may have the effect of earmarking a \nschool according to its racial composition, and this, in turn, may have a profound reciprocal effect on \nthe racial composition of residential neighborhoods. The Court said: \n\n[T]he practice of building a school . . . to a certain size and in a certain location `with conscious \nknowledge that it would be a segregated school,' . . . has a substantial reciprocal effect on the racial \ncomposition of other nearby schools. So also, the use of mobile classrooms, the drafting of student \ntransfer policies, the transportation of students, and the assignment of faculty and staff, on racially \nidentifiable bases, have the clear effect of earmarking schools according to their racial composition, \nand this, in turn, together with the elements of student assignment and school construction, may \nhave a profound reciprocal effect on the racial composition of residential neighborhoods within a \nmetropolitan area, thereby causing further racial concentration within the schools. \n413 U.S. at 201-02, 93 S.Ct. at 2694. \nThe clear import of Judge Roth's holding is that the defendants' discriminatory policies helped to \ndrive whites from the Detroit school district and to contain blacks in an ever-expanding core area of \nthe city. Viewed in this light, Judge DeMascio's holding, urged by the Board before this court, is that \nthe segregative effects of the defendants' discriminatory policies have been obliterated by the very \ndemographic 1150*1150 changes those policies helped to produce. We conclude that this argument \nrefutes itself. \nIt is the law of this case that the unconstitutional actions of defendants, both local and State, \ncontributed to the segregated residential patterns and the one race schools that now exist in Detroit. \nJudge Roth found that de jure school segregation encouraged whites to flee from racially changing \nneighborhoods and ultimately from the Detroit school district. That finding is supported by substantial \nrecord evidence and ample legal precedent. This being so, we reverse Judge DeMascio's holding \nthat population changes have obliterated the effects of the Board's past discrimination. This holding \nis contrary to the law of this case and, treated as a finding of fact, is clearly erroneous. On the \ncontrary, the record demonstrates that these population changes themselves are in part vestiges of \npast discrimination. \nIII \nWe turn our attention next to the holding of the district court that the overwhelming percentage of \nblack students in the school district as a whole and particularly in the inner-city regions, coupled with \nthe small number of white students even theoretically available for reassignment, foreclose the \npossibility of including any schools located in Regions 1, 5 and 8 in the pupil reassignment plan. We \nfind this holding constitutionally insupportable. \nThe last time this case was before us, we reversed the exclusion by the district court of the inner-city \nregions from the pupil reassignment plan. We recognized then that \"the overwhelming number of \nblack students in Detroit and their concentration in the inner-city undoubtedly makes some one-race \nschools unavoidable under any `Detroit only' remedy.\" 540 F.2d at 237. However, in order to justify \neliminating the inner-city regions entirely, we said, the Board would have to show the resultant all \nblack schools are not the product of past discrimination. This would be particularly difficult, we \nwarned, because these very regions were the ones hardest hit by past acts of de jure \nsegregation. 540 F.2d at 238. \"We cannot hold,\" we concluded, \"that where unconstitutional \nsegregation has been found, a plan can be permitted to stand which fails to deal with the three \nregions where the majority of the most identifiably black schools are located.\" 540 F.2d at 240. \nOn remand, the Detroit Board attempted to justify its exclusion of Regions 1, 5 and 8 by presenting \nevidence that the shift from white to black in the district had accelerated well beyond former \ndemographic predictions and made inner-city desegregation impossible. The Board's figures \nestablished that the percentage of black students in the district is increasing despite a decline in the \ntotal enrollment. Of the children who enter Detroit kindergartens, a greater proportion of blacks than \n\nwhites remain in the system throughout their school years. Mr. Hendrickson, the Board's expert, \nprojected the district's enrollment would be 91.8% black by 1981. Moreover, the district court found, \nresidential areas near the school district's fringe are becoming increasingly black as inner-city \nfamilies replace whites who leave the district entirely. 460 F.Supp. at 305-07. \nJudge DeMascio felt the Board's evidence established that no more desegregation of Regions 1, 5 \nand 8 is possible. 460 F.Supp. at 307. He concluded that integrating the inner-city schools would \nrequire the Board to scatter the remaining white students to such an extent that there would be no \nmeaningful interaction between the races in any school. The result would be mere token integration \nof the inner-city schools achieved at the cost of disrupting previously approved assignment patterns \nthat effectively desegregate the schools in other regions. \nTo illustrate the futility of attempting to include the inner-city regions, Judge DeMascio turned to \nstatistics. Pointing out that the district court had repeatedly rejected the notion of making all schools \nidentifiably black, Judge DeMascio held that only the excess of non-black over black \nstudents 1151*1151 in any given school could be considered available for reassignment to schools in \nRegions 1, 5 and 8. The Board's evidence showed there were 31 majority white elementary schools \nin the district with 3397 students available for reassignment. Six middle schools had 733 students \navailable and one high school had 175. However, the Board's evidence also showed the black \nenrollment in inner-city elementary schools was 38,259 or 11 times the number of whites available \nfor reassignment. The comparable figures for inner-city middle and high schools were 17,015 and \n17,783, or 23 times and 100 times the respective numbers of white students available for \nreassignment. 460 F.Supp. at 310. Accordingly, the court found, to disperse these few available \nwhite children among the schools in Regions 1, 5 and 8 would accomplish nothing more than token \nintegration, a result this court had previously rejected. 460 F.Supp. at 310, citing 540 F.2d at 239. \nThe flaw in the district court's logic was its assumption that Regions 1, 5 and 8 must be treated as \nunits, and that integrating schools in these Regions must be an all-or-nothing proposition. From the \noutset of this litigation's post-Milliken I remedial phase, Judge DeMascio seems to have assumed \nthat the inner-city regions must be treated in isolation from the rest of the district. See, e. g., 402 \nF.Supp. at 1129 (holding that the negligible benefits of including the inner-city do not justify \"the \nextraordinary remedy of such cross-regional bussing\"). Yet it was exactly this unitary treatment of \nRegions 1, 5 and 8 that led us to reverse and remand the last time this case was before us. \nCiting Davis v. Board of Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 38, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 1292, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 577 (1971), in which the Supreme Court refused to permit isolated treatment of one part of \nmetropolitan Mobile, we found it \"equally unacceptable to treat Regions 1, 5 and 8 in isolation from \nthe rest of the Detroit school system.\" 540 F.2d at 238. \nWe see no reason to treat the borders of the Detroit school system's inner-city administration regions \nas sacrosanct. In the first place, Detroit's regional scheme of school administration originated with \nAct No. 48, Public Laws of 1970, the same law whose § 12 we found to be an unconstitutional \ninterference with the Board's attempts to desegregate Detroit high schools. Were we to view the \nAct's remaining provisions as creating barriers to constitutionally required desegregation, we would \nhave to hold them unconstitutional also. United States v. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 \nU.S. 484, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 2217, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright v. Council of the City of \nEmporia,407 U.S. 451, 461-62, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 2202-03, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972). Furthermore, there is \nnothing in the Supreme Court's holding in Milliken I, supra, 418 U.S. at 745-46, 94 S.Ct. at 3127-\n28, that renders inviolable the lines of Administrative Regions within the Detroit School District. \nJudge Roth's ruling that the Detroit Board carried out a systematic program of segregation \nestablished a predicate for finding a dual school system in all the regions. See Keyes v. School \nDistrict No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 201, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2694, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). In \nsuch a situation, a district court may disregard the boundaries of administrative regions in order to \nvindicate constitutional rights. Milliken I, supra, 418 U.S. at 745, 94 S.Ct. at 3127.[2] \n\nThe district court erred when it held that Regions 1, 5 and 8 must be excluded in their entirety from \nthe pupil reassignment plan. The proper inquiry after this court's last remand was not whether there \nare enough white students available to desegregate every inner-city school. This court has \nrecognized from the first that some one race schools are unavoidable under a Detroit-only \nplan. See 540 F.2d at 237; 484 F.2d at 249. It, therefore, is irrelevant that there are 11 times as \nmany black students in all the inner-city elementary schools combined 1152*1152 as there are white \nstudents available for reassignment. What is crucial is whether those 3,397 white students can \npractically be reassigned to achieve effective levels of desegregation in some of the inner-city \nschools. That, and the analogous questions concerning the middle and high schools, are the issues \nthe district court should have addressed and is directed to address on remand from this decision. \nThe small number of white students available for reassignment and the problems involved in \ntransporting them may justify excluding some, and perhaps many, inner-city schools from the pupil \nreassignment plan. We emphasize that the need to cross regional lines does not justify such \nexclusion.[3] \nOn remand, the district court should apply substantially its August 15, 1977, remedial guidelines, 402 \nF.Supp. 1096, 1134, supra, but without regard to the boundary lines of administrative regions. White \nstudents should be considered available for reassignment only to the extent exchanging them with \npupils from inner-city schools will not render formerly integrated schools identifiably (more than 55 \nper cent) black. Where practicable, attendance zones should be redrawn across regional lines to \ninclude inner-city pupils in integrated schools. Where rezoning is impossible, as we anticipate it will \nbe in most instances, schools with white students available for reassignment should be paired with \nthe closest feasible inner-city school. In order to achieve effective levels of desegregation, it may be \nnecessary to pair several white schools with a single black school. Such pairing should be done with \na view toward minimizing the amount of transportation required. In some situations, it may be that \nthe small number of white students available for reassignment from a particular school, coupled with \nthe distance they would have to be transported to reach an inner-city school that can be paired with \nother white schools, will justify maintaining present assignment patterns. \nWe emphasize that this remand is not intended to disrupt previously approved assignment patterns. \nAs we said the last time this case was before us, \"the steps which [the district court] has taken thus \nfar appear to us to be consistent with the fourteenth amendment.\" 540 F.2d at 240. The district \ncourt's error was its failure to apply its remedial guidelines to schools in all the regions. Doing so \nmay well achieve at least some additional desegregation, and it is for this purpose that we are \nremanding. \nNor are our remand instructions intended to be a straight jacket on the district court. We recognize \nthat the district court must balance a variety of individual and collect interests in an effort to arrive at \n\"a plan that promises realistically to work . . . now.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, \n439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1694, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). Flexibility is essential to that end. \nOur last opinion in this case mirrored our frustration at our inability to chart a course that would guide \nthe district court to desegregate the entire school district: \nWe recognize that it would be appropriate for us at this point to supply guidelines to the District \nJudge as to what he should do under this remand. Omission of such guidelines is not based on any \nfailure to consider the problem in depth. It is based upon the conviction which this court had at the \ntime of its en banc opinion in this case — and for the reasons carefully spelled out therein — that \ngenuine constitutional desegregation can not 1153*1153 be accomplished within the school district \nboundaries of the Detroit School District. 540 F.2d at 240. \n\nThe district court, however, apparently interpreted the above-quoted comment as a recognition by \nthis court that effective pupil reassignments cannot be achieved in any of the schools in the three \ninner-city regions. See 460 F.Supp. at 304. Our comment was not so intended and should not be so \nread. Although genuine constitutional desegregation may be impossible within the Detroit district, \nthis court has the obligation to see that all practicable steps are taken to remedy the unconstitutional \nsegregation that has been found to exist. To that end, the district court's exclusion of all schools in \nRegions 1, 5 and 8 from the pupil reassignment plan is reversed and the cause remanded for further \nconsideration in light of this opinion. \nIV \nDespite his conclusion that \"no more desegregation is feasible in Regions 1, 5 and 8 collectively,\" \n460 F.Supp. at 307, Judge DeMascio determined there are white students in Region 2 available for \nreassignment to Region 1 schools. 460 F.Supp. at 311-12. Accordingly, he ordered the Detroit Board \nto prepare a supplemental pupil reassignment plan. The Board argues the district court exceeded its \nauthority by requiring further reassignments. We reject that argument. However, we vacate the \ncourt's order and remand the case for a hearing on the question whether Hispanic students should \nbe treated as white for desegregation purposes. \nThe district court found Region 2 is unique among Detroit's administrative regions in that it has not \nexperienced much growth since 1974 in the percentage of its students who are black. Indeed, the \ncourt found, some Region 2 schools had fewer black students in 1977 than in 1974. 460 F.Supp. at \n311. Overall, black students accounted for only 62% of the Region's 1977 enrollment. Furthermore, \nfourteen elementary schools in Region 2 had a total of 2145 white students available for \nreassignment. Thus, the court concluded, numbers alone pose no obstacle to reassigning Region 2 \nwhites to Region 1 schools. Id. \nJudge DeMascio apparently felt the concentration in Region 2 of programs of bilingual education for \nSpanish dominant children accounted for the relatively slow growth of the black enrollment in that \nRegion. We agree with the plaintiffs that restricting bilingual programs to one region provides \nHispanic families not only with neighborhood schools but with an incentive to concentrate in that \nregion. This artificial concentration of Hispanic whites, the district court found, in turn prevents the \nnational influx of black families and so contributes to resegregation of Region 2. 460 F.Supp. at 312. \nTo counteract this resegregative trend and to comply with the mandate of this court that inner-city \nschools be desegregated, the district court ordered the Board to develop a plan for reassigning \npupils between schools in Regions 1 and 2. \nThe Detroit Board advances three reasons the district court's order should be overturned. First, the \nBoard says, the Detroit school system is now unitary and the district court had no authority to order \nfurther reassignments. Second, even if the system is not yet unitary, reassigning Spanish-dominant \nstudents to Region 1 schools will disrupt State required bilingual educational programs while \nachieving only token integration. Third, the Board says, Hispanic students cannot be treated as white \nfor desegregation purposes. We deal with these arguments seriatim. \nThe Board's first argument depends on Judge DeMascio's holdings that \"the school district no longer \ndiscriminates against black students,\" and that \"its present assignment pattern is free from the \nvestiges of prior discrimination.\" 460 F.Supp. at 308. The case is therefore controlled by Pasadena \nCity Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976), the Board \nsays. Pasadena held a district court has no authority to order annual readjustments of attendance \nzones to compensate for demographic changes 1154*1154 that occur after a racially neutral \n\nattendance pattern has been achieved. Since its assignment plan is racially neutral, the Board says, \nthe district court had no authority to order further modification. \nThe short answer to this argument is that a racially neutral assignment plan does not necessarily \nachieve a racially neutral attendance pattern. The Board's plan is limited by residential patterns \nwhich reflect past discrimination, as well as by district lines and transportation problems. As the \nSupreme Court recognized in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. \nat 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282: \nThe objective is to dismantle the dual school system. \"Racially neutral\" assignment plans proposed \nby school authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the \ncontinuing effects of past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or \ndistortion of school size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation. . . . In short, an \nassignment plan is not acceptable simply because it appears to be neutral. \nThere are now 66,650 students attending schools in Regions 1, 5 and 8. The remedial measures \nimplemented to date afford none of these students any relief from de jure segregation. Detroit is still \nfar from achieving a racially neutral attendance pattern. This is not \na Pasadena situation.[4] See Adams v. United States, supra, 620 F.2d at 1291 (the failure of the St. \nLouis Board ever to adopt a desegregation plan to compensate for segregated residential patterns \nmakes Pasadena inapplicable). \nThe Board's second argument is that reassigning Spanish-dominant students to Region 1 schools \nwill disrupt bilingual educational programs while achieving only token integration. Dr. Felix Valbuena, \nthe Director of Bilingual Education for the Detroit school district, testified that reassigning Spanish \nspeaking students currently enrolled in Region 2 bilingual programs would impede the Board's ability \nto develop a model program and train bilingual teachers; produce fear and anxiety for the students; \nlimit community participation and interest in the schools; produce shortages of qualified bilingual \nteachers and necessary resource materials; and require the Board to adopt less efficient and \neffective methods of instruction. In return for this disruption, the Board says only 1600 students will \nbe reassigned, achieving token integration of only five of the thirty-one Region 1 schools. \nThe Board's concern for the continued viability of its bilingual educational programs is commendable. \nCircumstances permitting, we might well agree that the desegregative benefits would not justify the \ndisruption created by reassigning Spanish-dominant students. Circumstances, however, do not so \npermit. We agree with the district court that when the choice is between maintaining optimal \nconditions in a bilingual educational program and desegregating all-black schools, desegregation \nmust prevail. 460 F.Supp. at 312. See Keyes v. Denver School District No. 1, 521 F.2d 465, 480 \n(10th Cir. 1975),cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1066, 96 S.Ct. 806, 46 L.Ed.2d 657 (1976). \nThis brings us to the Board's third argument, that Hispanic students cannot be reassigned to \ndesegregate identifiably black schools because such students are themselves minorities. In support \nof this argument, the Board cites Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colo., supra, 413 U.S. 189, \n93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). \nIn the Keyes case, the Supreme Court found the school district's history of discrimination against \nHispanic students justified treating those students as minorities for desegregation purposes: \n1155*1155 We conclude, however, that the District Court erred in separating Negroes and Hispanos \nfor purposes of defining a \"segregated\" school. We have held that Hispanos constitute an identifiable \nclass for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Indeed, the District Court recognized this in \nclassifying predominantly Hispano schools as \"segregated\" schools in their own right. But there is \n\nalso much evidence that in the Southwest Hispanos and Negroes have a great many things in \ncommon. The United States Commission on Civil Rights has recently published two Reports on \nHispano education in the Southwest. Focusing on students in the States of Arizona, California, \nColorado, New Mexico, and Texas, the Commission concluded that Hispanos suffer from the same \neducational inequities as Negroes and American Indians. In fact, the District Court itself recognized \nthat \"[o]ne of the things which the Hispano has in common with the Negro is economic and cultural \ndeprivation and discrimination,\" [Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver Colorado], 313 F.Supp. [61], at \n69. This is agreement that, though of different origins, Negroes and Hispanos in Denver suffer \nidentical discrimination in treatment when compared with the treatment afforded Anglo students. In \nthat circumstance, we think petitioners are entitled to have schools with a combined predominance \nof Negroes and Hispanos included in the category of \"segregated\" schools. \n(Citations and footnotes omitted.) 413 U.S. at 197-98, 93 S.Ct. at 2691-2692. \nSimilarly, the Fifth Circuit has treated Hispanic students as minorities for purposes of school \ndesegregation. See United States v. Midland Independent School District, 519 F.2d 60, 63-64 (5th \nCir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 1106, 47 L.Ed.2d 314 (1976); Tasby v. Estes, 517 \nF.2d 92, 106-07 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 939, 96 S.Ct. 299, 46 L.Ed.2d 271 (1975) and \ncases cited therein. \nThe common element justifying treatment of Hispanic students as minorities in the Keyes, \nMidland, and Tasby cases was each school system's history of de jure segregation of Hispanos. \nIn Keyes, the Supreme Court found \"Negroes and Hispanos in Denver suffer identical \ndiscrimination.\" 413 U.S. at 198, 93 S.Ct. at 2692. In the Midlandcase, \"[t]he record clearly \ndemonstrate[d] that the Midland School District deliberately segregated Mexican-Americans from \nAnglos.\" 519 F.2d at 62. The Tasby court found record evidence \"to establish the isolation of \nMexican-American students in the [Dallas school system] from white students and the [Dallas \nsystem's] practice of `integrating' its Mexican-American students with black students.\" 517 F.2d at \n106. Thus, it appears, in school systems that historically have discriminated against Hispanic \nstudents, those students must be grouped with blacks rather than whites for desegregation \npurposes. \nBecause there is no indication in the record whether, historically, the Detroit school district has \ndiscriminated against Hispanic students, we are unable, on the present appeal, to affirm Judge \nDeMascio's decision that \"for school assignment purposes Spanish-surnamed students cannot be \ntreated differently than other white students.\" 460 F.Supp. at 312. On remand, the district court is \ndirected to conduct a hearing on that issue. \nOur remand for hearing on this issue places the case as an unusual posture. In order for the Board \nto prevail in its contention that Hispanic students cannot be treated as white, it must prove it \npracticed de jure segregation of such students. However, doing so would compound the Board's \nproblems because grouping Hispanos with blacks might require revision of the district court's \nremedial guidelines and a comprehensive review of previously approved assignment patterns, at \nleast in Region 2. This being so, it is possible that the Board may not continue to assert its present \nposition on remand. \nNor is any other party to the present litigation likely to argue there has been de jure segregation of \nHispanic students. The position of plaintiffs in the district court 1156*1156 was that concentrating \nbilingual programs in Region 2 provides neighborhood schools which in turn induce Hispanic families \nto move there. 460 F.Supp. at 312. The plaintiffs urged that this resegregative effect should be \ncountered by reassigning some Hispanic students to Region 1 schools. Treating Hispanos as blacks \nfor desegregation purposes would, of course, preclude such reassignments since the district court \nconsistently has refused to reassign blacks to identifiably black schools. Thus, the plaintiffs have no \n\nincentive to argue Hispanos have been the victims of de jure segregation in Detroit. Similarly, the \nState of Michigan defendants, who may well have to share the Board's liability for remedial costs if \nthe court finds de jure segregation of Hispanic students, seem unlikely to present evidence of \ndiscrimination. \nBecause none of the existing parties is likely to argue that Hispanic students have been victims of de \njure segregation in Detroit, the district court is directed to permit individuals or organizations \nrepresenting Detroit's Hispanic community to intervene in the remand proceedings for the limited \npurpose of presenting evidence on this issue. Our opinion in the related case, No. 78-1598, 620 F.2d \n1141 (6th Cir. 1980), recognizes the right of LULAC Council No. 11054, and its co-appellants to \nintervene in these remand proceedings solely on the issue of de jure segregation of Hispanos. \nShould other individuals or organizations also wish to intervene on behalf of the Hispanic \ncommunity, the district court will determine under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 whether their interests are \nadequately represented by LULAC Council No. 11054 et al.; additional intervenors need not be \npermitted unless their participation as parties will serve some useful purpose. We emphasize here, \nas in our opinion in No. 78-1598, that intervention will be limited to the issue of de jure segregation of \nHispanic students in the Detroit school system. \nUnless the district court finds the defendants discriminated against Hispanic students, it may treat \nsuch students as white for desegregation purposes. The court then would be free to order \nimplementation of its previously approved reassignment plan for Hispanic students, or any \nmodification thereof found to be desirable. We suggest, however, that the district court permit \nLULAC Council No. 11054 et al. to participate as amici curiae in developing a reassignment plan that \nwill achieve the maximum amount of desegregation possible without neglecting the bilingual \neducational needs of Hispanic students. Before any additional reassignments are implemented, \nincluding those contained in the previously approved plan of the district court for transporting Region \n2 students to Region 1, they should be tested against the August 15, 1975, guidelines as modified \nby Part III of this opinion. \nAccordingly, the district court's order directing the Board to implement additional pupil reassignments \nin Regions 1 and 2 is vacated. The cause is remanded for a hearing on the question whether \nHispanic students should be treated as white for desegregation purposes and for other action \nconsistent with the outcome of that hearing. \nV \nThe final question we must address is whether Judge DeMascio erred in declining to recuse himself \nfrom the remand proceedings in this case. We hold he did not err. \nBriefly, the plaintiffs argue Judge DeMascio violated 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) and Canon 3 A(4) of the \nCode of Judicial Conduct by engaging in various ex parte contacts and discussions with court-\nappointed experts, community groups and representatives of the Detroit Board. In an opinion \nreported at 426 F.Supp. 929 (E.D.Mich. 1977), Judge DeMascio denied plaintiffs' motion for recusal. \n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), as amended,[5] provides: \n1157*1157 § 455. Disqualification of justice, judge, magistrate, or referee in bankruptcy \n(a) Any justice, judge, magistrate, or referee in bankruptcy of the United States shall disqualify \nhimself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. \n\nThe plaintiffs complain that Judge DeMascio created the appearance of partiality by meeting ex \nparte with the Detroit Board's representatives on August 15, 1975, even before plaintiffs' counsel \nhad received a copy of the court's just filed remedial guidelines, to discuss an impending teachers' \nstrike. The plaintiffs also argue Judge DeMascio engaged in what they term \"negotiations\" with the \nBoard in developing a desegregation plan, a process from which they were excluded. \nJudge DeMascio's opinion denying recusal discusses these complaints and his underlying actions in \ndetail, and we need not recount them here. See 426 F.Supp. at 935-39. He characterized the \nincidents of which plaintiffs complain as \"judicial activities designed to ensure a community climate \nreceptive to [the] court's orders.\" 426 F.Supp. at 939. The so-called negotiation process was \ndesigned \"to avoid the formality of an order,\" he said. Id. Concluding that his actions were \"well \nwithin [his] discretion and were based on substantial precedent,\" Judge DeMascio held § 455(a) did \nnot require recusal. Id. \nWe agree. Although perhaps a bit unorthodox, Judge DeMascio's actions appear to us to have been \njudicial activities. To make out a case for recusal under § 455(a), a movant must rely on extra-\njudicial conduct rather than matters arising in a judicial context. Davis v. Board of School \nCommissioners of Mobile County, supra, 517 F.2d at 1052 (construing amended § 455(a) in pari \nmateria with 28 U.S.C. § 144, the other federal disqualification statute). See United States v. Grinnell \nCorp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); Berger v. United States, 255 \nU.S. 22, 31, 41 S.Ct. 230, 232, 65 L.Ed. 481 (1921). Accordingly, we affirm Judge DeMascio's \ndecision that recusal was not required. \nThe plaintiffs also complain that Judge DeMascio's conduct violated Canon 3 A(4) of the Code of \nJudicial Conduct: \n(4) A judge should accord to every person who is legally interested in a proceeding, or his lawyer, \nfull right to be heard according to law, and, except as 1158*1158 authorized by law, neither initiate \nnor consider ex-parte or other communications concerning a pending or impending proceeding. A \njudge, however, may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a \nproceeding before him if he gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and the substance of \nthe advice, and affords the parties reasonable opportunity to respond. \nIn addition to his previously described meeting with Board representatives and \"negotiations\" over \nthe Board's proposed desegregation plans, the plaintiffs argue, Judge DeMascio's use of experts \nviolated Canon 3 A(4). By order of April 15, 1975, Judge DeMascio appointed three educators as \nexperts to assist him in gathering background information, soliciting the views of community groups \nand educators, and evaluating the Educational Components of the Board's remedial plan. The \nplaintiffs do not question the court's authority to utilize experts. Rather, they complain the court's \nexperts did not file reports of record and were never subject to cross-examination, but submitted \ntheir views ex parte. \nWe do not believe Judge DeMascio's use of experts, or his receipt through them of community and \nexpert views on how best to approach the problems of desegregating Detroit schools, required \nrecusal. We are concerned with the plaintiffs' charge that the reports of these experts were not \nplaced in the record nor made available to the parties. Accordingly, we expressly direct that if any \nexperts are employed to advise the district court on any further matters in this litigation, they shall \nprepare written reports, copies of which shall become part of the record and shall be made available \nto all parties or their attorneys. \nThe remedial phase of this litigation has been protracted and arduous. We recognized in a previous \nopinion that \"District Judge DeMascio was faced with an extremely difficult (if not impossible) \n\nassignment, confronted as he was with the responsibility of formulating a decree which would \neliminate the unconstitutional segregation found to exist in the Detroit public schools, without \ntransgressing the limits established by the Supreme Court.\" 540 F.2d at 236. Our review of Judge \nDeMascio's various opinions and orders inclines us not to disagree with District Judge James P. \nChurchill's assessment[6] of Judge DeMascio's conduct in these remedial proceedings: \nIt is my opinion that the manner in which Judge Robert E. DeMascio has presided in this case has \nbeen exemplary and should command the respect of the parties, counsel, the judiciary, and the \npublic. 426 F.Supp. at 944. \nHowever, in view of the public interest in the instant school desegregation case, the challenge raised \nby the plaintiffs, and the bitter feelings that have developed, this court suggests that, on remand, the \nChief Judge of the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan reassign this case either to \nhimself or to another appropriate judge. \nVI \nIt was indicated during oral argument that plaintiffs intend to proceed with their efforts to establish, \nwithin the guidelines enunciated by the Supreme Court in Milliken v. Bradley,418 U.S. 717, 744-47, \n94 S.Ct. 3112, 3126-28, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (Milliken I,) a basis for a metropolitan \nremedy. See 540 F.2d at 240; 411 F.Supp. at 937. Our limited affirmances in Bradley v. Milliken, 540 \nF.2d 229 (6th Cir. 1976), and the present appeal are without prejudice to the district court's \nobligation to proceed with the inter-district litigation, if pursued by the plaintiffs. \nOn remand, the district court will be empowered to make further alterations in its previously \napproved remedial plans, as the evidence may require. \n1159*1159 The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with \nthis opinion and our previous opinion reported at 540 F.2d 229. No costs are taxed. Each party will \nbear its own costs on this appeal. \n[1] Nothing in this opinion is intended to reflect adversely upon the present Detroit Board of Education. Throughout the \ncourse of this often bitter litigation members of the present Board have cooperated with the district court's endeavor to \nremedy the unconstitutional de jure segregation created by acts and policies of their predecessors and former State officials. \nReferences in this opinion to the Board's discriminatory acts should he read as references to the actions of past, not present, \nBoard members. \n[2] In fact, Judge DeMascio's remedial guidelines specified that, when the Board attempted rezoning to achieve integration \nin other regions without transporting students, \"regional lines need not be respected; when the choice is between preserving \nregional lines and bussing, regional lines must give way.\" 402 F.Supp. at 1134. \n[3] The decision of the district court to treat the inner-city regions as units and to exclude them entirely from the \nreassignment plan distinguishes this case from Calhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1975), rehearing denied,525 F.2d \n1203 (1975). The Calhoun court refused, in light of Atlanta's 85 per cent black student population, to order further pupil \nreassignments even though 92 of the system's 148 schools were over 90 per cent black. However, there is no indication \nthose 92 identifiably black schools were concentrated in one or several administrative regions left wholly untouched by the \npupil reassignment plan. Moreover, if we were convinced that the Fifth Circuit permitted Atlanta's desegregation plan to be \nlimited by intra-district administrative lines, we would be forced to disagree with its decision. \n[4] In light of our holding that Detroit has not yet achieved a unitary system, we need not decide whether the concentration of \nbilingual programs in Region 2 is having a resegregative effect and, if so, whether that fact standing alone would empower \nthe district court to order additional relief. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 420, 97 S.Ct. 2766, \n2775, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977) (Dayton I); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). \n\n[5] Section 455 was amended by the Act of December 5, 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-512, 88 Stat. 1609. Section 1 of that Act \nsubstituted the present subsection (a) for the former version which read: \n\"Any justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any case in which he has a substantial interest, has been \nof counsel, is or has been a material witness, or is so related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to render it \nimproper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial, appeal, or other proceeding therein.\" \nThere is agreement among the courts that the purpose of the amendment was to change the standard for recusal from a \nsubjective to an objective one, as well as to overrule the prior concept that close cases involving disqualification should be \nresolved against recusal on the ground the judge has a duty to sit. See, e. g., United States v. Cowden, 545 F.2d 257 (1st \nCir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 1181, 51 L.Ed.2d 585 (1977); Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of \nMobile County, 517 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied,425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976). \nThere is a split among the circuits, however, as to whether the amended version of § 455(a), with its objective standard, \napplies to post amendment proceedings in cases, such as this one, filed before the amendment's effective date. Section 3 of \nthe amending act provided the amended version \"shall not apply to the trial of any proceeding commenced prior to [Dec. 5, \n1974] nor to appellate review of any proceeding which was fully submitted to the reviewing court prior to [that date].\" The \nFourth and Eighth Circuits have held the amended version inapplicable to post amendment proceedings in cases filed \nbefore December 5, 1974. In re Virginia Electric & Power Co., 539 F.2d 357 (4th Cir. 1976); United States v. Dodge, 538 \nF.2d 770 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1099, 97 S.Ct. 1118, 51 L.Ed.2d 547 (1977). The Fifth Circuit has \ndisagreed. Potashnick v. Port City Construction Co., 609 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1980); Parrish v. Board of Commissioners of \nAlabama State Bar,524 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975) (en banc), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1977). \nJudge DeMascio held the amended version of § 455(a) inapplicable in the present case. 426 F.Supp. at 932. \nBecause we think the actions of Judge DeMascio do not require recusal even under the section as amended, we need not \ndecide which version applies to this case. Rather, we assume for purposes of this decision that the amended version of the \nstatute applies. \n[6] Judge Churchill's comment is taken from his opinion holding, on a question referred to him by the Chief Judge of the \ndistrict, that Judge DeMascio's conduct had not created the appearance of partiality and so did not require recusal in regard \nto faculty assignments. \n ",

Proposed intervenors assert that they had a right to intervene under Rule 24(a) or, \nalternatively, that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for \npermissive intervention under Rule 24(b). Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), (b). For the following reasons, \nwe affirm the district court's judgment. \nI. \n\nThis complaint was initially filed as a class action suit on August 18, 1970, by parents and \nchildren in the Detroit public school system, as well as the Detroit Branch of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) which was recognized as a \nparty-plaintiff and a class representative. The complaint alleged that the Detroit School \nBoard, the Superintendent of Public Instruction and various local and state officials had \nengaged in intentional racial segregation of the Detroit public schools. On prior appeals, \nstate and local authorities were found liable for intentional discrimination, Bradley v. \nMilliken, 484 F.2d 215 (6th Cir.1973) (en banc), aff'd in part, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, \n41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), and a desegregation plan incorporating the use of educational \ncomponents was upheld. Bradley v. Milliken, 540 F.2d 229 (6th Cir.1976), aff'd, 433 U.S. \n267, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977). More recently, in September 1985, we reversed \na district court order terminating its jurisdiction over the community relations program, the \nuniform code of student conduct and the monitoring commission. Bradley v. Milliken, 772 \nF.2d 266 (6th Cir.1985), vacating 585 F.Supp. 348 (E.D.Mich.1984). We held that the \ndistrict court had failed to provide the parties with adequate notice and a hearing regarding \nthe propriety of terminating jurisdiction over the community relations program and the \nuniform code of student conduct; and, although the parties had been notified that changes \nin the monitoring commission's role were at issue, we determined that the district court's \ndecision regarding the monitoring commission also could not be upheld since we had struck \ndown one of the court's major premises for terminating jurisdiction over the \ncommission. Id. at 272. Accordingly, we vacated the district court's order and remanded the \ncase for further proceedings, returning the case to the status quo ante. We also granted the \ndistrict court the limited discretion to enter an order which would provide for a smooth \ntransition back to these revitalized programs. \nThe present controversy regarding the district court's denial of a motion to intervene stems \nfrom a relatively complex chain of events which we will only highlight here. On March 16, \n1985, then-counsel of record for the plaintiff class, Thomas I. Atkins, filed with the district \ncourt a notification of his withdrawal as General Counsel for the NAACP and its Special \nContribution Fund (SCF), and informed the court that Grover G. Hankins was his permanent \nsuccessor as General Counsel who would be making an appearance on behalf of the \nNAACP and 1189*1189 SCF in the near future. The notice continued: \"It is my intent, with the \napproval of the Court, to remain in the case as a counsel for the certified class.\" \nIn the months following this court's 1985 remand order, Atkins continued to make \nappearances before the district court, and controversy continued to focus on the uniform \ncode of student conduct, community relations program and monitoring commission. On \nNovember 12, 1985, two of the three judges withdrew from the panel assigned to the case, \nand the lawsuit proceeded before District Judge Cohn only. Although a hearing on this \ncourt's remand order was initially scheduled for December 1985, it was rescheduled for \nJanuary 1986, following a status conference on November 19, 1985. Plaintiffs and \nintervening defendant Detroit Federation of Teachers then sought a writ of mandamus in \nthis court asserting, inter alia, that the district court was not complying with the remand \ninstructions because the case had not been returned to the status quo ante. This court \ndenied the mandamus petition on April 9, 1986, reasoning that the arguments could be \nasserted on direct appeal. \n\nOn January 13, 1986, the day the hearing was scheduled to commence, the district court for \nthe first time addressed the issue raised by attorney Hankins and fellow attorney Horace \nStone as to which attorneys represented which plaintiffs. Hankins and Stone urged the court \nto rule that Atkins' notice of withdrawal of appearance, their appearance, and the history of \nthe case established that they were lead counsel for the plaintiff class and that Atkins did \nnot represent any party. The concern over who was lead counsel principally arose from a \ndifference in opinion as to whether or how to enter into negotiation settlements with the \nDetroit School Board. Hankins was in favor of entering into settlement negotiations with the \nSchool Board and was not opposed to placing the Superintendent of Public Instruction in \ncharge of the monitoring function, a plan which the district court expressly approved of. \nHankins, in short, believed that an adversary relationship with the School Board was no \nlonger beneficial, whereas Atkins believed Hankins' approach was not in the best interest of \nthe plaintiff class. Atkins believed that anything short of an independent monitoring \ncommission was inadequate to guarantee compliance with the remedial order, and that \nparents must continue to play an active role in the remedial stage. \nThe district court did not resolve this issue immediately, requesting the parties to provide it \nwith more information regarding the NAACP's role in the litigation. In the meantime, \nsettlement negotiations involving all attorneys continued. \nShortly thereafter at a status conference on January 21, 1986, Atkins, in the name of the \nplaintiff class, filed a motion to supplement class representatives. This motion was opposed \nby all other counsel of record, including Hankins and Stone. \nA hearing to determine which counsel represented the plaintiff class was then held on \nJanuary 28, 1986 Atkins asserted that the Detroit Branch of the NAACP had been \nwithdrawn as party-plaintiff in 1974, and that he had accordingly represented the plaintiff in \nhis individual capacity, not in his capacity as General Counsel of the NAACP and SCF. He \nargued that he should therefore be permitted to continue as lead counsel for plaintiffs given \nhis expertise and familiarity with the issues. \nOn January 30, 1986, the district court entered an order addressing a number of issues \npending before it, including who would proceed as counsel for the plaintiff class. The court \napproved the substitution of Hankins and Stone as General Counsel for the NAACP and \nSCF in Atkins' place, and then concluded that \"the lead or principal attorney for the plaintiffs \nhas at all times been the General Counsel of the Association and Fund, as distinguished \nfrom the particular attorney occupying that position.\" Accordingly, the court ruled that \nHankins became the attorney for the plaintiff class as soon as he succeeded Atkins. The \ncourt also rejected the option of dividing the responsibilities between Hankins and Atkins \ngiven the nature of their disagreements over how the litigation should 1190*1190proceed. \nHowever, the court expressly invited Atkins to participate in the remaining proceedings as \namicus curiae. \nThe court denied the motion to supplement class representatives on February 3, 1986. \nSpecifically, the court noted that the case was \"in the twilight of its remedial phase\" and that \nparticipation by the proposed supplementary representatives would not assist the court in \nany significant way. The court also denied a motion to reconsider this ruling. \n\nOn March 4, 1986, a motion to intervene pursuant to Rules 24(a) and (b), Fed.R.Civ.P., was \nfiled by Atkins on behalf of appellants herein, and a revised motion to intervene was filed on \nMarch 13, 1986. The motion asserted that the present class representatives did not \nadequately represent their interests, particularly with respect to the proper role of the \nmonitoring commission and other remedial efforts. A hearing was held on this motion on \nApril 7, 1986, with three individuals testifying in support of the motion. \nFirst, Valerie McNeece, co-chair of the Ludington School Community Organization for the \nMiddle Magnet School, testified that the Ludington School was improperly deviating from \nracial and gender quotas in its enrollment procedures. She testified that her efforts to elicit \naid from the NAACP, and Hankins in particular, had failed. \nSecond, Helen Moore, one of the co-founders of Black Parents for Quality Education and its \ncurrent spokesperson, testified that she believed Hankins was siding with the defendants \nand did not represent BPQE's interests, although she admitted that she agreed with \nNAACP's ultimate goal of a unitary school system. She further stated that BPQE was a \nloosely knit \"movement,\" with no constitution, by-laws, officers, dues or identifiable \nmembers. Although Moore did not have any children presently enrolled in the public \nschools, she claimed that BPQE and she were deeply involved in the Detroit school \nsystem's affairs. \nFinally, Ray Litt testified. Although a named plaintiff and class representative in this lawsuit, \nLitt was included in the motion to intervene. Litt testified that the NAACP no longer \nrepresented his interests because it had abandoned its initial position on the school \ncommunity relations component of the case and had failed to support the continued \nexistence of an independent monitoring commission. Further, he was concerned about the \ndeterioration of the Cass High School program which he testified began in 1981 with the \nstart of the vocational high school component of the remedial order. He had never \ncontacted Hankins or the court about his concerns. \nThe district court denied the motion to intervene on May 2, 1986. The court noted that the \nmotion to intervene had been stimulated by this court's prior order reversing the district \ncourt's termination of jurisdiction over various aspects of the remedial decree, stating that its \nerrors had been rectified on remand. The court concluded that the problems with the \nLudington Middle School, as outlined by McNeece, were \"discrete and involve[d] a possible \nviolation of the remedial decree ... [and constituted] an insufficient basis for allowing \nintervention.\" The court noted that future problems with the Ludington School should be \ndirected to the monitor, who was fully aware of the situation at the school. The court further \nstated that Litt's concerns about the adverse impact of the vocational high schools on Cass \nhad never been raised to the court, and could not form the basis for intervention given the \nnumber of years the problem had existed. The court concluded: \nThe real controversy implicated by the petition to intervene is not the inadequacy of \nrepresentation by the Detroit Chapter of the NAACP as class representative but rather Mr. \nAtkins's disagreement as to how the litigation should be conducted. Given the present \nstatus of the case where the only outstanding issue, except for the continuing obligations of \nthe Detroit Board under the remedial decree, is the appropriateness of long term \nsuspension as a form of punishment under the Code of Student Conduct, petitioners have \n\noffered no good reason to add additional lawyers to the roster of 1191*1191 lawyers in the \ncase. As previously observed, \"[T]here can be but one ... master of a litigation.\" Manning v. \nMercantile Trust Co., 26 Misc. 440, 57 N.Y.S. 467, 468 (1899). \nThis timely appeal followed. \nII. \nThe proposed intervenors state that this appeal \"constitutes the continued effort to require \nthe District Court to obey the 1985 mandate of this Court.\" They challenge the wisdom of \nvarious actions below concerning the uniform code of student conduct, the community \nrelations program and the monitoring commission, as well as the propriety of the district \ncourt's decision to remove class counsel. We must note as an initial matter that we cannot \nreview the merits of the district court's rulings with respect to any of these issues given the \npresent posture of the case. Rather, this case is before us solely on an appeal from the \ndenial of a motion to intervene. \nA. \nThe proposed intervenors first argue that they had a right to intervene in this lawsuit \npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), which provides in pertinent part: \n(a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in \nan action ... (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction \nwhich is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the \naction may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that \ninterest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties. \nA motion to intervene as a matter of right must therefore be timely, United Airlines, Inc. v. \nMcDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 387, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 2466, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977); NAACP v. New \nYork, 413 U.S. 345, 365, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2602, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973), and the proposed \nintervenor must establish (1) that he has an interest which is the subject matter of the \nlawsuit, (2) which is likely to be impaired by the disposition of the lawsuit, and (3) that the \nexisting parties cannot adequately protect that interest. See Triax Co. v. TRW, Inc., 724 \nF.2d 1224, 1227 (6th Cir.1984); Brewer v. Republic Steel Corp., 513 F.2d 1222, 1223 (6th \nCir.1975). \nThe threshold determination of whether a motion is timely is a matter within the sound \ndiscretion of the trial court. NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. at 365-66, 93 S.Ct. at 2602-\n03; Michigan Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. Smith, 657 F.2d 102, 105 (6th Cir.1981). \nTimeliness should be evaluated in the context of all relevant circumstances, such as the \npurpose of the motion to intervene, the length of time the applicant for intervention should \nhave known of his interest in the case, whether the original parties would be prejudiced by \nfurther delays, whether there are any unusual circumstances which would bear on granting \nor denying the motion and to what stage the lawsuit has progressed. Michigan Ass'n for \nRetarded Citizens, 657 F.2d at 106; Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dep't, 679 F.2d 579, 582 (6th \nCir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 969, 103 S.Ct. 297, 74 L.Ed.2d 280 (1982); see also United \n\nAirlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. at 396, 97 S.Ct. at 2470 (court must determine whether \nthe intervenor acted promptly in view of all the circumstances). \nAppellees vigorously assert that appellants' motion to intervene was untimely. They assert \nthat the motion was filed for the sole purpose of permitting attorney Atkins to participate as \nlead counsel in the lawsuit, that appellants knew of the ongoing litigation and recent \nnegotiations long before the motion was filed, and that the original parties would suffer \nprejudice by further delays, particularly in light of the fact that this case has been in its \nremedial stage for many years. Appellants counter that they filed this motion as soon as it \nbecame evident that the remaining parties would not represent their interests. \nWe do not reach the merits of this argument. The district court did not rely on untimeliness \nto deny the proposed intervenors' motion, and we believe it would be improper to make \nfindings on all the relevant 1192*1192 criteria without the benefit of the district court's \ninsights. Therefore, for the remainder of our analysis, we will assume that the threshold \nrequirement of timeliness has been met. \nAlthough the Supreme Court has yet to define what constitutes a sufficient interest to satisfy \nthe interest requirement of Rule 24(a)(2), it has generally been accepted that students, \nparents of children in the school system and parent organizations have a sufficient interest \nin eliminating segregation in the schools to satisfy this requirement, and that their interest \ncould be impaired by the disposition of a school desegregation case. See Morgan v. \nMcDonough, 726 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1984); United States v. Board of School Comm'rs of \nIndianapolis, Ind., 466 F.2d 573, 575 (7th Cir.1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. \n964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 (1973); Liddell v. Caldwell, 546 F.2d 768, 770 (8th Cir.1976), cert. \ndenied, 433 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2987, 53 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1977). Further, this court has \nacknowledged that \"interest\" is to be construed liberally. Hatton v. County Bd. of Educ. of \nMaury County, Tenn., 422 F.2d 457, 461 (6th Cir.1970). \nHowever, in the instant case, the district court found that the problem at the Ludington \nMiddle School, as testified to by witness McNeece, was discrete and \"[i]n association with \nthe other parties to the petition, this is an insufficient basis for allowing intervention.\" It could \nbe concluded that a discrete interest such as this fails to establish the necessary \"direct, \nsubstantial interest\" in the overall desegregation suit required by Rule 24(a)(2). See Brewer \nv. Republic Steel Corp.,513 F.2d at 1223. Similarly, BPQE may not be entitled to the \npresumption of having a sufficient interest generally granted to parent organizations. Being \na loosely knit \"movement\" rather than an organization, with no identifiable members or \nstructure, and having a principal spokesperson who presently does not have children in the \nDetroit public school system, it too may not have a \"direct, substantial interest\" in this \nlawsuit. Finally, it is clear that Ray Litt cannot intervene in the same lawsuit in which he is \nalready a named party. \nHowever, even assuming that the proposed intervenors have stated a sufficient interest in \nthis litigation which is likely to be impaired — i.e., an interest in preserving particular \nremedial components — they must also establish that the present class representatives will \nnot adequately protect that interest. See Meyer Goldberg, Inc. v. Goldberg, 717 F.2d 290, \n293 (6th Cir.1983) (\"the applicant for intervention bears the burden of demonstrating \ninadequate representation\"). This requires \"overcom[ing] the presumption of adequacy of \n\nrepresentation that arises when the proposed intervenor and a party to the suit ... have the \nsame ultimate objective.\" Wade v. Goldschmidt, 673 F.2d 182, 186 n. 7 (7th Cir.1982) (per \ncuriam). An applicant for intervention fails to meet his burden of demonstrating inadequate \nrepresentation \"when no collusion is shown between the representatives and an opposing \nparty, when the representative does not have or represent an interest adverse to the \nproposed intervenor, and when the representative has not failed in its fulfillment of his \nduty.\" Id.; see also Liddell v. Caldwell, 546 F.2d at 770; Morgan v. McDonough, 726 F.2d at \n14. A mere disagreement over litigation strategy or individual aspects of a remediation plan \ndoes not, in and of itself, establish inadequacy of representation. Cf. United States v. \nHooker Chemicals & Plastics Corp., 749 F.2d 968, 987 (2d Cir.1984) (\"The mere existence \nof disagreement over some aspects of the remediation necessary to abate the hazard does \nnot demonstrate a lack of capacity on the part of the government as parens patriae to \nrepresent its constituents fairly and faithfully.\"); United States v. Perry County Bd. of \nEduc., 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir.1978)(\"Appellants are not entitled to intervention of right \nsimply because they would have voted differently had they been members of these \nrepresentative bodies.\"). \nThe proposed intervenors essentially raised three complaints about the adequacy of \nrepresentation on the part of the class representatives: problems at the \nLudington 1193*1193 School, deterioration of Cass High School, and the modification of the \nmonitoring and community relations components of the remedial decree. We conclude that \nthe testimony does not support a finding of inadequate representation concerning any of \nthese complaints. \nFirst, as became evident at the evidentiary hearing on this motion, the district court and the \nmonitor were fully aware of the enrollment difficulties at the Ludington School. Although the \nclass representatives had not attended to this issue with the expediency desired by LSCO, \nthe concerns had been raised, and the court has taken action to look into the problems. \nAccordingly, no showing of inadequate representation has been made. Cf. Bradley v. \nMilliken, 620 F.2d 1141, 1142(intervenor's arguments had already been raised by the \nDetroit School Board and the court had ordered that the issues be taken into account). In \nlight of the circumstances, we believe the interests articulated by the LSCO representative \ncan be protected without intervention. See Hatton, 422 F.2d at 461 (must establish that \ninterest can only be protected through intervening in the proceedings). \nSecond, Ray Litt's testimony regarding the problems at Cass High School cannot form the \nbasis of a motion to intervene of right. The difficulties allegedly began in 1981, several years \nbefore the motion to intervene was filed, and were never brought to the attention of the \ndistrict court or counsel for the class. Litt admitted that he had never contacted Hankins \nabout this problem. Inadequacy of representation cannot be shown on the basis of this \nrecord. \nFinally, the proposed intervenors argue that by NAACP's agreeing to a plan to place the \nprincipal monitoring role with the Superintendent of Public Instruction rather than an \nindependent commission, the class representative had abandoned an essential part of the \nremedial decree and therefore had failed in its duty to represent their interests. They liken \nthis to situations where the parties' interests, though once in accord with each other, have \nparted significantly and irreconcilably. See, e.g., Triax Co. v. TRW, Inc., 724 F.2d at \n\n1228; cf. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Bd., 499 F.2d 914, 917 (5th Cir.1974) (per \ncuriam) (evidentiary hearing required to determine which group more properly represents \nthe interests of the black community). They assert that by having an interest which is \ndiverse from that of the plaintiff class, they have a right to intervene. \nWe disagree. It appears evident to us that the present class representatives and proposed \nintervenors share the same ultimate objective in a unitary school district. Although the \nlitigation strategy has altered, this objective has not been abandoned by current counsel. \nWe cannot say at this point in the litigation and upon this record that the agreed-to \nmodifications in the monitoring component, or other changes in the remedial plan, so harm \nmembers of the plaintiff class and the proposed intervenors that the class representatives \nhave failed to fulfill their duty. Further, while the proposed intervenors strongly oppose \nabandoning an adversarial role vis-a-vis the Detroit School Board, such a decision is not the \nequivalent of \"collusion\" with the opposing party. On the basis of the record before us, we \nsimply cannot find that such differences of opinion lead to a conclusion that representation \nhas been inadequate to protect the interests of the proposed intervenors. \nAccordingly, the district court did not err in finding that appellants failed to establish a right \nto intervene under Rule 24(a)(2). \nB. \nAlternatively, appellants assert that the district court abused its discretion in denying their \nmotion for permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b). Rule 24(b) grants the district \ncourt discretionary power to permit intervention if the motion is timely, NAACP v. New \nYork, 413 U.S. at 365, 93 S.Ct. at 2602. Michigan Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, 657 F.2d at \n105, and if the \"applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or \nfact in common.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2). Rule 24(b)(2) also provides that \"[i]n \nexercising 1194*1194 its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will \nunduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" We therefore \nreview a denial of a Rule 24(b) motion only for an abuse of discretion. See Meyer Goldberg, \nInc., 717 F.2d at 294. For the reasons already set forth above, we will assume the motion \nwas timely filed. \nWe can detect no basis upon which to find an abuse of discretion. This suit is several years \nolder than when we upheld a prior denial of a motion to intervene citing the advanced age of \nthe case and the possible adverse effect of further delays on the parties. See Bradley, 620 \nF.2d at 1142. Further, when it appears that the proposed intervenors may attempt to have \nthe court reconsider its prior rulings, as in the instant case, concern over delay and \nprejudice to the parties is particularly apparent. See Hatton, 422 F.2d at 461. \nMoreover, the district court has already taken steps to protect the proposed intervenors' \ninterests by inviting attorney Atkins to appear as amicus curiae in the case. This would allow \nthe district court the benefit of hearing proposed intervenors' concerns and views, as well as \nthe benefit of Atkins' expertise, before it rules on issues in the advanced remedial phase of \nthis desegregation action. See Bradley, 620 F.2d at 1142 (can protect interests by \npetitioning court to participate as amicus curiae); Penick v. Columbus Educ. Ass'n, 574 F.2d \n889, 890 (6th Cir.1978) (per curiam) (district court allowed participation as amicus in \n\nremedial stage of school desegregation proceedings); cf. Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dep't, 679 \nF.2d at 584 (court afforded proposed intervenors the opportunity to air objections).[1] \nFinding that appellants failed to establish a right to intervene under Rule 24(a) and that the \ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants' motion for permissive \nintervention, we AFFIRM the district court's order. \nMERRITT, Circuit Judge, dissenting. \nI agree with the Court's disposition of the permissive intervention issue under Rule 24(b) but \ndisagree with its decision concerning mandatory intervention under § 24(a). The Court rests \nits decision on \"adequacy of representation,\" and I disagree with its decision that the new \nNAACP general counsel is adequately representing the group of black parents represented \nby Thomas Atkins, Esq. These parents insist that the provisions of the consent decree \nestablishing the monitoring commission, the community relations program and the student \nconduct code should not be changed. The new NAACP counsel has agreed with the school \nboard and the State to make significant changes in these programs, including transferring \nthe monitoring function from an independent local agency to the state and reducing the role \nof parents in the community relations program. The NAACP and the defendants may very \nwell be right on the merits, but their positions are directly contrary to the position of the \nblack parents who believe the terms of the consent decree should be fully carried out. I \nbelieve the District Court and this Court will be assisted by having both sides of the issue \nfully ventilated, and this cannot be done if one side is excluded from the courtroom. \nI recognize that Mr. Atkins and his clients are \"divisive\" and sometimes difficult to deal with \nand that the NAACP, the defendants and the Court may well be tired of this case and Mr. \nAtkins' tactics. I am persuaded, however, by Mr. Atkins' argument that the monitoring \nfunction should not be turned over to the state without an adversary hearing where parties \non both sides are heard. I think the arguments in favor of the consent decree and the status \nquo need to be heard and considered. I think Mr. Atkins' clients are entitled to \nbe 1195*1195 heard, and I would not agree to the settlement modifying the consent decree \nwithout letting them have their day in court. \n[1] Intervenors suggest that the district court did not allow permissive intervention because the court was frustrated \nwith Atkins' persistence on important issues over which there was considerable disagreement. While a strong \nshowing of improper motive on the part of the district court would possibly require reversal, there has been no such \nshowing here. See Morgan v. McDonough, 726 F.2d at 15. \n ",

No. 35257. \nUnited States District Court, E. D. Michigan, S. D. \nDecember 19, 1975. \n938*938 Louis R. Lucas, Ratner, Sugarmon & Lucas, Memphis, Tenn., for plaintiffs. \nGeorge T. Roumell, Jr., Riley & Roumell, Detroit, Mich., Theodore Sachs, Marston, Sachs, \nO'Connell, Nunn & Freid, Detroit, Mich., George L. McCargar, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., Lansing, Mich., \nfor defendants. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nDeMASCIO, District Judge. \nThe defendants in this school desegregation suit, 78 separate and identifiable school districts in \nWayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties,[1] have joined in a Motion to Strike, For More Definite \nStatement and For Additional Relief. Defendants contend that the plaintiffs' Second Amended \nComplaint is vague and indefinite, that it fails to comply with this court's April 29, 1975 order, that it \ncontains immaterial allegations that should be stricken or in the alternative made more definite \nbecause they do not comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that it contains \naverments dealing with issues the Supreme Court has already decided do not justify interdistrict \nrelief, which should be stricken, and that it contains a number of averments alleging only residential \nracial segregation, which are not material in a school desegregation case and should be stricken. \nFinally, the defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to maintain this action for interdistrict \nrelief. \nWe deal first with the issue of standing. Defendants argue that the recently decided Supreme Court \ncase of Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343(decided June 25, 1975), \ncompels the conclusion that plaintiffs herein lack standing to sue. In Warth, the Supreme Court \ndecided that plaintiffs, various organizations and individuals residing in the Rochester, New York \nmetropolitan area, did not have standing to challenge alleged exclusionary zoning practices of the \nneighboring community 939*939 of Pennfield, New York. Defendants argue that, according \nto Warth, plaintiffs herein, residents of Detroit, lack standing to challenge alleged discriminatory \nhousing patterns in the surrounding suburban areas. \n\nWhile we are of course bound by the Supreme Court's decision in Warth, we do not believe that it \napplies to the situation here. In Warth, the decision that plaintiffs lacked standing was grounded \nupon the plaintiffs' inability to demonstrate that the acts alleged caused injury to themselves, rather \nthan other unidentified members of the class to which they belonged. In Warth, none of the \npetitioners had a present interest in any Pennfield property, none was himself subject to the \nstrictures of the ordinance, and none had ever been denied a variance or permit by the respondent \nofficials. Plaintiffs' alleged injury was the deprivation of housing opportunities in Pennfield, but as the \nCourt pointed out, they were unable to show that members of their class would have lived in \nPennfield but for the complained-of conduct. In contrast, plaintiffs herein have not complained \nmerely that they have been deprived of housing opportunities in the suburban school districts; they \ncomplain that such deprivation has had the effect of causing segregation in the schools of the City of \nDetroit. Thus, the injury in fact that the plaintiffs have alleged is the segregation of the Detroit \nschools, not the denial of housing opportunities in suburban communities. This is an injury suffered \nby plaintiffs themselves, not by other unnamed third parties. \nThus, since Warth is inapplicable, plaintiffs' standing to aver and establish interdistrict equal \nprotection violations must be determined by the test first announced in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, \n204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). The Court there announced that the \"gist of the \nquestion of standing\" is whether the parties seeking relief have \"alleged such a personal stake in the \noutcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation \nof issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult . . . questions.\" The \nSupreme Court reaffirmed this test in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. \nCamp, 397 U.S. 150, 153-154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970): \n\"The question of standing . . . concerns, apart from the `case' or `controversy' test, the question \nwhether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of \ninterests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\" \nStanding in this context thus requires that plaintiffs themselves were injured in fact (i. e., have a \nsufficient interest in the outcome of the litigation) and be arguably within the zone of interest \nsufficiently to assure the advocacy essential in an actual case or controversy. The plaintiffs here \nhave already established injury resulting from the segregation found to exist in the Detroit city \nschools, and now aver that acts by the state and suburban defendants contributed to that injury. \nThey have thus established that they are arguably within the constitutional guarantee in question \nand have clearly demonstrated a sufficient personal interest to assure the advocacy essential to the \nprogress of the litigation. \nDefendants' other objections to plaintiffs' standing to sue may be disposed of easily. Defendants \nargue that, to the extent that the class is composed of white persons, such persons lack standing to \nvindicate the rights of black persons. However, this argument lacks merit because segregation is an \nact that injures black and white alike. Defendants argue that under Moose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U.S. \n163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), plaintiffs have made no showing of injury in fact. This \nargument is grounded upon the defendants' failure to comprehend that the injury complained of is \nnot the denial of housing opportunities in the suburbs, but segregation of the Detroit schools, an \ninjury that has in fact occurred. See Bradley 940*940 v. Milliken, 338 F.Supp. 582 (E.D.Mich. \n1971), aff'd 484 F.2d 215 (6th Cir. 1973), rev'd on other grounds, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 \nL.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). Defendants further argue that by making allegations concerning alleged \ndiscriminatory hiring practices in suburban school districts and other internal affairs of school districts \nother than Detroit, plaintiffs are attempting to assert the rights of third parties. But insofar as these \nallegations are raised not in and of themselves, but for their effect on segregation in the City of \nDetroit, they do relate to an injury suffered by plaintiffs themselves. Finally, defendants argue that \nplaintiffs are seeking to hold defendants responsible for the activities of state and governmental units \n\nover which they have no control. This argument is unsound: it addresses the sufficiency of the \nallegations, not the standing to maintain the action in the first instance. \nHaving concluded that plaintiffs have standing to sue, we now address ourselves to the merits of \ndefendants' motion. Defendants make two separate objections to the allegations of plaintiffs' second \namended complaint: (1) certain paragraphs should be stricken because they raise issues not \nmaterial to a school desegregation suit, and (2) certain paragraphs should be stricken or, in the \nalternative, made more definite because they do not comply with the requirements of specificity in \nRule 8, Fed.R. Civ.P. \nDefendants have vigorously contended that all allegations of discrimination in the public and private \nhousing markets, as set forth in paragraphs 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 28 and 29 of the Second \nAmended Complaint, should be stricken as immaterial to school desegregation issues. Defendants \nargue that a racial imbalance alone does not violate constitutional rights and that, in any event \nschool districts cannot be used as vehicles for vindicating alleged housing discrimination unrelated \nto school district policies. Defendants contend that Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d \n55 (6th Cir. 1966); Higgins v. Board of Education of City of Grand Rapids, 508 F.2d 779 (6th Cir. \n1974); Spencer v. Kugler, 326 F.Supp. 1235 (D.N.J.1971), aff'd 404 U.S. 1027, 92 S.Ct. 707, 30 \nL.Ed.2d 723 (1972); and Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971), compel this result. \nWhile the cases are confusing and at times contain conflicting conclusions, we do not agree that \nresidential discrimination in the public and private housing markets is necessarily immaterial to the \nissue of segregation in public schools. For example, Higgins v. Board of Education, supra, does not \nsupport that proposition; the court there did not find that as a matter of law such allegations were \nimmaterial, but found only that the proofs offered were insufficient to support the allegations. In Deal \nv. Cincinnati Board of Education, supra, the U. S. Court of Appeals held that the district court \ncorrectly excluded evidence of alleged housing discrimination because the proofs there established \nonly de facto segregation, which the court found did not justify relief.[2] \nWe do not agree that the authority relied upon by the defendants compels us to strike these \nallegations. We believe that a proper reading of these cases is that, while allegations of housing \ndiscrimination standing alone are insufficient to support a finding of school segregation necessary to \njustify interdistrict relief, findings of housing discrimination will not excuse a finding of school \nsegregation where the school districts involved have engaged in other segregative acts at some time \nin the past. In other words, allegations of housing discrimination are material if other \nseparate 941*941 acts of de jure segregation by the defendants are alleged and proved. Thus, \nin Evans v. Buchanan,393 F.Supp. 428 (D.Del.1975) an interdistrict remedy was imposed because \nresidential racial discrimination continued and contributed to the effects of prior de jure acts of \ndiscrimination. Here, the allegations contained in paragraphs 14 and 21(b), (c), (d), and (e), if taken \nas true, are sufficient to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to submit their proofs on housing \ndiscrimination. In paragraph 14, for example, plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he availability of financial \nassistance and the operation of the state bonding and state aid formula enables suburban districts to \nmake a larger per pupil expenditure despite less tax effort\" and that this condition \"affect[s] the racial \ncharacteristics of both city and suburban school districts . . ..\" Paragraph 21 contains some \nallegations that are specific and, at least as far as the school districts cited, may support findings and \nconclusions in plaintiffs' favor. \nThus, although our order will require the plaintiffs to plead with greater specificity, we agree that their \ncomplaint alleges more than merely de facto segregation. The gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint is \nthat acts taken by the state and suburban defendants, coupled with housing discrimination in public \nand private markets, have had the effect of segregating the Detroit schools. We are reminded \n\nthat de jure acts of segregation have already been established as to the Detroit school district, a fact \nnot present in the authority relied upon by defendants. In Swann v. Board of Education, supra, the \nSupreme Court stated: \n\"We do not reach in this case the question whether a showing that school segregation is a \nconsequence of other types of state action, without any discriminatory action by the school \nauthorities, is a constitutional violation requiring remedial action by a school desegregation decree. \nThis case does not present that question and we therefore do not decide it.\" 402 U.S. at 23, 91 S.Ct. \nat 1279. \nA complaint with proper averments established by adequate proof may well place that question, left \nundecided by Swann, before this court. \nWhile we have found that plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint contains allegations sufficient to \nsurvive a motion to strike, we do not mean to say that their complaint is completely satisfactory. \nPlaintiffs' present complaint was filed on April 29, 1975, pursuant to our April 16, 1975 Memorandum \nOrder denying defendants' motion to dismiss and granting plaintiffs leave to amend. In that order, we \nencouraged plaintiffs to file \"a proper amended complaint\" and admonished them to \"re-evaluate the \nevidence they intend to produce to establish interdistrict violations and name parties defendant \naccordingly.\" At that time, the court had for its consideration plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, \nwhich was filed pursuant to an order by the U. S. Court of Appeals \"to conform averments with the \nevidence and to add necessary defendants for remedial purposes.\" (April 16, 1975 Memo. Order.)[3] \nWe are unable to perceive any material differences between plaintiffs' First and Second Amended \nComplaints. Both complaints are full of vague, indefinite and conclusory allegations. In their Second \nAmended Complaint, plaintiffs have continued to name the same parties defendant, still referring to \nthem as \"original\", \"intervening\", and \"added suburban\" defendants. Such terms indicate that the \nplaintiffs fail to perceive that the original phase of this litigation is over, and that they are in effect in a \nnew lawsuit with new defendants. Rather than alleging precise interdistrict 942*942 violations against \nspecifically named defendants, the plaintiffs have made wholesale allegations against all of the \nsuburban defendants that were included in the so-called \"desegregation area\" by the late Honorable \nStephen Roth when a metropolitan remedy was first before this court over three years ago. \nHowever, the court's order defining the \"desegregation area\" there did not consider the issue we \nface here: whether specific acts of segregation were committed by these districts to warrant an \ninterdistrict remedy. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 733, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). \nFor plaintiffs to persist in joining all 78 defendants in this action indicates to us that they do not \nperceive the precise holding of the Milliken decision: \n\"Specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or \nof a single school district have been a substantial cause of inter-district segregation.\" 418 U.S. at \n745, 94 S.Ct. at 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d at 1091. \nIn order to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, plaintiffs must be specific. They must \nallege and prove specific de jure acts of segregation committed by the state and/or one or more of \nthe suburban defendants having the effect of segregating the Detroit city schools. Moreover, it is \nessential that these acts, as alleged and proved, have an effect on segregation in Detroit, since it is \nthe Detroit plaintiffs who are seeking relief. \nAccordingly, we conclude that paragraphs 12, 16-20, 25, 28 and 29, which allege nothing more \nthan de facto housing discrimination, are vague, lack specificity and do not meet the requirements of \nRule 8, Fed.R.Civ.P. The averments alleging specific acts of housing discrimination fail to allege \nspecifically how such housing discrimination caused or contributed to school segregation in the City \n\nof Detroit. Further, these allegations do not allege with clarity whether the suburban districts \ncommitted these acts, which suburban districts committed these acts, or whether such allegations \npertain solely to the state defendants. Moreover, if these averments apply only to the state \ndefendants, they do not allege the causation or relationship to the Detroit city schools. \nEven allegations that we cite herein as a possible basis for a finding of liability do not meet the \nrequirements of specificity mandated by Rule 8. In paragraph 21, plaintiffs allege certain specific \nacts taken by certain specific defendants, but do not allege how, when and to whom these \nallegations relate and in what manner the acts alleged caused or contributed to segregation in the \nDetroit city schools. To survive a motion to strike, plaintiffs must allege facts specific enough to \nenable the defendants to defend. They must allege what the acts were, when they were committed, \nwho did them, and what effect they had, if any, on segregation in Detroit. \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, \n17, 18, 19, 20, 21(a), (b), (c), (d), 25, 26, 28, and 29 is denied; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion to strike the words \"original\", \"intervening\", \n\"intervening suburban\", \"added\" and \"added suburban\" from paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 is \ngranted; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion for a more definite statement as to paragraphs \n12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21(a), (b), (c), (d), 25, 26, 28 and 29 is granted. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to Rule 12(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., plaintiffs shall file within \ntwenty (20) days a Third Amended Complaint which contains specific and precise averments \nconsistent with this Memorandum and Order, or face the granting of defendants' motion to strike \nsuch allegations. Such a Third Amended Complaint shall allege with specificity what acts were \ncommitted by what defendants, when they were committed, and what their effect was on segregation \nin Detroit, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that plaintiffs, 943*943 within the twenty-day period, may apply \nto this court for additional time upon a showing of good cause. \n[1] The only school district in the tri-county area that is excluded is the Pontiac, Michigan, School District. \n[2] Similarly, in Spencer v. Kugler, 326 F.Supp. 1235 (D.N.J.1971) the court dismissed plaintiff's complaint for failure to state \na claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that the state had no affirmative duty to act where only de \nfacto discrimination was found. But see Ybarra v. City of San Jose, 503 F.2d 1041 (9th Cir. 1974). While the Ybarra case is \na distinct departure from Deal, the latter, being a Sixth Circuit case, is binding upon us. \n[3] We held that the First Amended Complaint was inadequate because \"[it] was not filed to relitigate the cause, nor to \nlitigate cross-district violations . . . The first amended complaint was filed to conform the pleadings to proofs which the \nSupreme Court found insufficient to justify metropolitan relief.\" (Order, April 16, 1975 at p. 5.) \n ",

Kelley, Attorney General of Michigan, argued the cause for petitioners. With him on \nthe briefs were Robert A. Derengoski, Solicitor General, and Gerald F. Young, George L. \nMcCargar, and Mary Kay Bottecelli, Assistant Attorneys General. \nNathaniel R. Jones argued the cause for Bradley respondents. With him on the brief were Paul R. \nDimond, Louis R. Lucas, Robert A. Murphy, William E. Caldwell, and Richard S. Kohn. George T. \nRoumell, Jr., argued the cause for respondent Detroit Board of Education. With him on the brief \nwere Jane K. Souris and Thomas M. J. Hathaway.[*] \n269*269 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \nWe granted certiorari in this case to consider two questions concerning the remedial powers of \nfederal district courts in school desegregation cases, namely, whether a District Court can, as part of \na desegregation decree, order compensatory or remedial educational programs for schoolchildren \nwho have been subjected to past acts of de juresegregation, and whether, consistent with the \nEleventh Amendment, a federal court can require state officials found responsible for constitutional \nviolations to bear part of the costs of those programs. \nI \nThis case is before the Court for the second time, following our remand, Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. \nS. 717 (1974) (Milliken I); it marks the culmination of seven years of litigation over de jure school \nsegregation in the Detroit public school system. For almost six years, the litigation has focused \nexclusively on the appropriate remedy to correct official acts of racial discrimination committed by \nboth the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan. No challenge is now made by the State or \nthe local school board to the prior findings of de jure segregation.[1] \n270*270 A \n\nIn the first stage of the remedy proceedings, which we reviewed in Milliken I, supra, the District \nCourt, after reviewing several \"Detroit-only\" desegregation plans, concluded that an interdistrict plan \nwas required to \"`achieve the greatest degree of actual desegregation . . . [so that] no school, grade \nor classroom [would be] substantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition.'\" 345 F. \nSupp. 914, 918 (ED Mich. 1972), quoted in Milliken I, supra, at 734. On those premises, the District \nCourt ordered the parties to submit plans for \"metropolitan desegregation\" and appointed a nine-\nmember panel to formulate a desegregation plan, which would encompass a \"desegregation area\" \nconsisting of 54 school districts. \nIn June 1973, a divided Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, upheld, 484 F. 2d 215 (CA6), the District \nCourt's determination that a metropolitanwide plan was essential to bring about what the District \nCourt had described as \"the greatest degree of actual desegregation . . . .\" 345 F. Supp., at 918. We \nreversed, holding that the order exceeded appropriate limits of federal equitable authority as defined \nin Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, 24 (1971), by concluding that \n\"as a matter of substantive constitutional right, [a] particular degree of racial balance\" is required, \nand by subjecting other school districts, uninvolved with and unaffected by any constitutional \nviolations, to the court's remedial powers. Milliken I, supra. Proceeding from the Swannstandard \n\"that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation,\" \nwe held that, on the record before us, there was no interdistrict violation 271*271 calling for an \ninterdistrict remedy. Because the District Court's \"metropolitan remedy\" went beyond the \nconstitutional violation, we remanded the case for further proceedings \"leading to prompt formulation \nof a decree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in the Detroit city schools, a remedy \nwhich has been delayed since 1970.\" 418 U. S., at 753.[2] \nB \nDue to the intervening death of Judge Stephen J. Roth, who had presided over the litigation from the \noutset, the case on remand was reassigned to Judge Robert E. DeMascio. Judge DeMascio \npromptly ordered respondent Bradley and the Detroit Board to submit desegregation plans limited to \nthe Detroit school system. On April 1, 1975, both parties submitted their proposed plans. \nRespondent Bradley's plan was limited solely to pupil reassignment; the proposal called for \nextensive transportation of students to achieve the plan's ultimate goal of assuring that every school \nwithin the district reflected, within 15 percentage points, the racial ratio of the school district as a \nwhole.[3]In contrast to respondent Bradley's 272*272 proposal, the Detroit Board's plan provided for \nsufficient pupil reassignment to eliminate \"racially identifiable white elementary schools,\" while \nensuring that \"every child will spend at least a portion of his education in either a neighborhood \nelementary school or a neighborhood junior and senior high school.\" 402 F. Supp. 1096, 1116 \n(1975). By eschewing racial ratios for each school, the Board's plan contemplated transportation of \nfewer students for shorter distances than respondent Bradley's proposal.[4] \nIn addition to student reassignments, the Board's plan called for implementation of 13 remedial or \ncompensatory programs, referred to in the record as \"educational components.\" These \ncompensatory programs, which were proposed in addition to the plan's provisions for magnet \nschools and vocational high schools, included three of the four components at issue in this case—in-\nservice training for teachers and administrators, guidance and counseling programs, and revised \ntesting procedures.[5]Pursuant to the District Court's direction, the State Board of Education[6] on \nApril 21, 1975, 273*273 submitted a critique of the Detroit Board's desegregation plan; in its report, \nthe State Board opined that, although \"[i]t is possible that none of the thirteen `quality education' \ncomponents is essential . . . to correct the constitutional violation . . . ,\" 8 of the 13 proposed \nprograms nonetheless deserved special consideration in the desegregation setting. Of particular \nrelevance here, the State Board said: \n\n\"Within the context of effectuating a pupil desegregation plan, the in-service training [and] guidance \nand counseling . . . components appear to deserve special emphasis.\" 4 Record, Doc. 591, pp. 38-\n39.[7] \nAfter receiving the State Board's critique,[8] the District Court conducted extensive hearings on the \ntwo plans over a two-month period. Substantial testimony was adduced with respect to the proposed \neducational components, including testimony by petitioners' expert witnesses.[9] Based on \nthis 274*274 evidence and on reports of court-appointed experts, the District Court on August 11, \n1975, approved, in principle, the Detroit Board's inclusion of remedial and compensatory educational \ncomponents in the desegregation plan.[10] \n\"We find that the majority of the educational components included in the Detroit Board plan are \nessential for a school district undergoing desegregation. While it is true that the delivery of quality \ndesegregated educational services is the obligation of the school board, nevertheless this court \ndeems it essential to mandate educational components where they are needed to remedy effects of \npast segregation, to assure a successful desegregative effort and to minimize the possibility of \nresegregation.\" 402 F. Supp., at 1118. \nThe District Court expressly found that the two components of testing and counseling, as then \nadministered in Detroit's 275*275 schools, were infected with the discriminatory bias of a segregated \nschool system: \n\"In a segregated setting many techniques deny equal protection to black students, such as \ndiscriminatory testing [and] discriminatory counseling . . . .\" Ibid. \nThe District Court also found that, to make desegregation work, it was necessary to include remedial \nreading programs and in-service training for teachers and administrators: \n\"In a system undergoing desegregation, teachers will require orientation and training for \ndesegregation. . . . Additionally, we find that . . . comprehensive reading programs are essential . . . \nto a successful desegregative effort.\" Ibid. \nHaving established these general principles, the District Court formulated several \"remedial \nguidelines\" to govern the Detroit Board's development of a final plan. Declining \"to substitute its \nauthority for the authority of elected state and local officials to decide which educational components \nare beneficial to the school community,\" id., at 1145, the District Judge laid down the following \nguidelines with respect to each of the four educational components at issue here: \n(a) Reading. Concluding that \"[t]here is no educational component more directly associated with the \nprocess of desegregation than reading,\" id., at 1138, the District Court directed the General \nSuperintendent of Detroit's schools to institute a remedial reading and communications skills \nprogram \"[t]o eradicate the effects of past discrimination . . . .\" Ibid. The content of the required \nprogram was not prescribed by the court; rather, formulation and implementation of the program was \nleft to the Superintendent and to a committee to be selected by him. \n(b) In-Service Training. The court also directed the Detroit Board to formulate a comprehensive in-\nservice teacher 276*276 training program, an element \"essential to a system undergoing \ndesegregation.\" Id., at 1139. In the District Court's view, an in-service training program for teachers \nand administrators, to train professional and instructional personnel to cope with the desegregation \nprocess in Detroit, would tend to ensure that all students in a desegregated system would be treated \nequally by teachers and administrators able, by virtue of special training, to cope with special \nproblems presented by desegregation, and thereby facilitate Detroit's conversion to a unitary system. \n\n(c) Testing. Because it found, based on record evidence, that Negro children \"are especially affected \nby biased testing procedures,\" the District Court determined that, frequently, minority students in \nDetroit were adversely affected by discriminatory testing procedures. Unless the school system's \ntests were administered in a way \"free from racial, ethnic and cultural bias,\" the District Court \nconcluded that Negro children in Detroit might thereafter be impeded in their educational \ngrowth. Id., at 1142. Accordingly, the court directed the Detroit Board and the State Department of \nEducation to institute a testing program along the lines proposed by the local school board in its \noriginal desegregation plan. Ibid. \n(d) Counseling and Career Guidance. Finally, the District Court addressed what expert witnesses \nhad described as psychological pressures on Detroit's students in a system undergoing \ndesegregation. Counselors were required, the court concluded, both to deal with the numerous \nproblems and tensions arising in the change from Detroit's dual system, and, more concretely, to \ncounsel students concerning the new vocational and technical school programs available under the \nplan through the cooperation of state and local officials.[11] \n277*277 Nine months later, on May 11, 1976, the District Court entered its final order. Emphasizing \nthat it had \"been careful to order only what is essential for a school district undergoing \ndesegregation,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a, the court ordered the Detroit Board and the state \ndefendants to institute comprehensive programs as to the four educational components by the start \nof the September 1976 school term. The cost of these four programs, the court concluded, was to be \nequally borne by the Detroit School Board and the State. To carry out this cost sharing, the court \ndirected the local board to calculate its highest budget allocation in any prior year for the several \neducational programs and, from that base, any excess cost attributable to the desegregation plan \nwas to be paid equally by the two groups of defendants responsible for prior constitutional \nviolations, i. e., the Detroit Board and the state defendants. \nC \nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order concerning \nthe implementation of and cost sharing for the four educational components.[12] 540 F. 2d 229 \n(1976). The Court of Appeals expressly 278*278 approved the District Court's findings as to the \nnecessity for these compensatory programs: \n\"This finding . . . is not clearly erroneous, but to the contrary is supported by ample evidence. \n\"The need for in-service training of the educational staff and development of nondiscriminatory \ntesting is obvious. The former is needed to insure that the teachers and administrators will be able to \nwork effectively in a desegregated environment. The latter is needed to insure that students are not \nevaluated unequally because of built-in bias in the tests administered in formerly segregated \nschools. \n\"We agree with the District Court that the reading and counseling programs are essential to the effort \nto combat the effects of segregation. \n. . . . . \n\"Without the reading and counseling components, black students might be deprived of the motivation \nand achievement levels which the desegregation remedy is designed to accomplish.\" Id., at 241. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Court of Appeals confirmed that the District Court relied largely on the \nDetroit School Board in formulating the decree: \n\"This is not a situation where the District Court `appears to have acted solely according to its own \nnotions of good educational policy unrelated to the demands of the Constitution.'\" Id., at 241-242, \n\nquoting Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 521 F. 2d 465, 483 (CA10 1975), cert. \ndenied, 423 U. S. 1066 (1976). \nAfter upholding the remedial-components portion of the plan, the Court of Appeals went on to affirm \nthe District Court's allocation of costs between the state and local officials. Analyzing this Court's \ndecision in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), which reaffirmed the rule that the \nEleventh 279*279 Amendment bars an ordinary suit for money damages against the State without its \nconsent, the Court of Appeals held: \n\"[The District Court's order] imposes no money judgment on the State of Michigan for past de jure \nsegregation practices. Rather, the order is directed toward the State defendants as a part of \na prospective plan to comply with a constitutional requirement to eradicate all vestiges of de jure \nsegregation.\" 540 F. 2d, at 245. (Emphasis supplied.) \nThe Court of Appeals remanded the case for further consideration of the three central city regions \nuntouched by the District Court's pupil reassignment plan. See n. 12, supra. \nThe state defendants then sought review in this Court, challenging only those portions of the District \nCourt's comprehensive remedial order dealing with the four educational components and with the \nState's obligation to defray the costs of those programs. We granted certiorari, 429 U. S. 958 (1976), \nand we affirm. \nII \nThis Court has not previously addressed directly the question whether federal courts can order \nremedial education programs as part of a school desegregation decree.[13]However, the general \nprinciples governing our resolution of this issue are well settled by the prior decisions of this Court. In \nthe first case concerning federal courts' remedial powers in eliminating de jure school segregation, \nthe Court laid down the basic rule which governs to this day: \"In fashioning and 280*280 effectuating \nthe [desegregation] decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles.\" Brown v. Board of \nEducation,349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) (Brown II). \nA \nApplication of those \"equitable principles,\" we have held, requires federal courts to focus upon three \nfactors. In the first place, like other equitable remedies, the nature of the desegregation remedy is to \nbe determined by the nature and scope of the constitutional violation. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S., at 16. The remedy must therefore be related to \n\"the condition alleged to offend the Constitution . . . .\" Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 738.[14] Second, the \ndecree must indeed be remedial in nature, that is, it must be designed as nearly as possible \"to \nrestore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence \nof such conduct.\" Id., at 746.[15] Third, the federal courts in devising a remedy must 281*281 take into \naccount the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own affairs, consistent with the \nConstitution. In Brown II the Court squarely held that \"[s]chool authorities have \nthe primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems . . . .\" 349 U. S., at \n299. (Emphasis supplied.) If, however, \"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations . . . \njudicial authority may be invoked.\" Swann, supra, at 15. Once invoked, \"the scope of a district court's \nequitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.\" Ibid. \n\nB \nIn challenging the order before us, petitioners do not specifically question that the District Court's \nmandated programs are designed, as nearly as practicable, to restore the schoolchildren of Detroit \nto the position they would have enjoyed absent constitutional violations by state and local officials. \nAnd, petitioners do not contend, nor could they, that the prerogatives of the Detroit School Board \nhave been abrogated by the decree, since of course the Detroit School Board itself proposed \nincorporation of these programs in the first place. Petitioners' sole contention is that, \nunder Swann, the District Court's order exceeds the scope of the constitutional violation. Invoking \nour holding in Milliken I,petitioners claim that, since the constitutional violation found by the District \nCourt was the unlawful segregation of students on the basis of race, the court's decree must be \nlimited to remedying unlawful pupil assignments. This contention misconceives the principle \npetitioners seek to invoke, and we reject their argument. \nThe well-settled principle that the nature and scope of 282*282 the remedy are to be determined by \nthe violation means simply that federal-court decrees must directly address and relate to the \nconstitutional violation itself. Because of this inherent limitation upon federal judicial authority, \nfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does \nnot violate the Constitution or does not flow from such a violation, see Pasadena Bd. of \nEducation v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424 (1976),or if they are imposed upon governmental units that \nwere neither involved in nor affected by the constitutional violation, as in Milliken I, \nsupra. Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284, 292-296 (1976). But where, as here, a constitutional \nviolation has been found, the remedy does not \"exceed\" the violation if the remedy is tailored to cure \nthe \"`conditionthat offends the Constitution.'\" Milliken I, supra, at 738. (Emphasis supplied.) \nThe \"condition\" offending the Constitution is Detroit's de jure segregated school system, which was \nso pervasively and persistently segregated that the District Court found that the need for the \neducational components flowed directly from constitutional violations by both state and local officials. \nThese specific educational remedies, although normally left to the discretion of the elected school \nboard and professional educators, were deemed necessary to restore the victims of discriminatory \nconduct to the position they would have enjoyed in terms of education had these four components \nbeen provided in a nondiscriminatory manner in a school system free from pervasive de jure racial \nsegregation. \nIn the first case invalidating a de jure system, a unanimous Court, speaking through Mr. Chief \nJustice Warren, held in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495 (1954) (Brown I): \"Separate \neducational facilities are inherently unequal.\" And in United Statesv. Montgomery County Bd. of \nEduc., 395 U. S. 225 (1969), the Court concerned itself not with pupil assignment, but with the \ndesegregation of faculty and staff as part of the process of dismantling a dual 283*283 system. In \ndoing so, the Court, there speaking through Mr. Justice Black, focused on the reason for judicial \nconcerns going beyond pupil assignment: \"The dispute . . . deals with faculty and staff \ndesegregation, a goal that we have recognized to be an important aspect of the basic task of \nachieving a public school system wholly free from racial discrimination.\" Id., at 231-232. (Emphasis \nsupplied.) \nMontgomery County therefore stands firmly for the proposition that matters other than pupil \nassignment must on occasion be addressed by federal courts to eliminate the effects of prior \nsegregation. Similarly, in Swann we reaffirmed the principle laid down in Green v. County School \nBd., 391 U. S. 430 (1968), that \"existing policy and practice with regard to faculty, staff, \ntransportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities were among the most important indicia of a \nsegregated system.\" 402 U. S., at 18. In a word, discriminatory student assignment policies can \nthemselves manifest and breed other inequalities built into a dual system founded on racial \n\ndiscrimination. Federal courts need not, and cannot, close their eyes to inequalities, shown by the \nrecord, which flow from a longstanding segregated system. \nC \nIn light of the mandate of Brown I and Brown II, federal courts have, over the years, often required \nthe inclusion of remedial programs in desegregation plans to overcome the inequalities inherent in \ndual school systems. In 1966, for example, the District Court for the District of South Carolina \ndirected the inclusion of remedial courses to overcome the effects of a segregated system: \n\"Because the weaknesses of a dual school system may have already affected many children, the \ncourt would be remiss in its duty if any desegregation plan were approved which did not provide for \nremedial education courses. They shall be included in the plan.\" Miller v. School 284*284District 2, \nClarendon County, S. C., 256 F. Supp. 370, 377 (1966). \nIn 1967, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, then engaged in overseeing the desegregation of \nnumerous school districts in the South, laid down the following requirement in an en banc decision: \n\"The defendants shall provide remedial education programs which permit students attending or who \nhave previously attended segregated schools to overcome past inadequacies in their \neducation.\" United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 380 F. 2d 385, 394, cert. \ndenied, 389 U. S. 840 (1967). (Emphasis supplied.) \nSee also Stell v. Board of Public Education of Savannah, 387 F. 2d 486, 492, 496-497 (CA5 \n1967); Hill v. Lafourche Parish School Board, 291 F. Supp. 819, 823 (ED La. \n1967); Redman v. Terrebonne Parish School Board, 293 F. Supp. 376, 379 (ED La. \n1967); Leev. Macon County Board of Education, 267 F. Supp. 458, 489 (MD Ala. \n1967); Graves v. Walton County Board of Education, 300 F. Supp. 188, 200 (MD Ga. \n1968), aff'd, 410 F. 2d 1153 (CA5 1969). Two years later, the Fifth Circuit again adhered to the rule \nthat district courts could properly seek to overcome the built-in inadequacies of a segregated \neducational system: \n\"The trial court concluded that the school board must establish remedial programs to assist students \nwho previously attended all-Negro schools when those students transfer to formerly all-white schools \n. . . . The remedial programs . . . are an integral part of a program for compensatory education to be \nprovided Negro students who have long been disadvantaged by the inequities and discrimination \ninherent in the dual school system. The requirement that the School Board institute remedial \nprograms so far as they are feasible is a proper exercise of the court's discretion.\" Plaquemines \nParish School Bd. v. 285*285 United States, 415 F. 2d 817, 831 (1969). (Emphasis supplied.) \nIn the same year the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana required school \nauthorities to come forward with a remedial educational program as part of a desegregation plan. \n\"`The defendants shall provide remedial education programs which permit students . . . who have \npreviously attended all-Negro schools to overcome past inadequacies in their \neducation.'\" Smith v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, 302 F. Supp. 106, 110 (1969), aff'd, 448 F. \n2d 414 (CA5 1971). See also Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board, 304 F. Supp. 244, 253 (ED \nLa. 1969); Moses v. Washington Parish School Board, 302 F. Supp. 362, 367 (ED La. 1969). \nIn the 1970's, the pattern has been essentially the same. The Fifth Circuit has, when the fact \nsituation warranted, continued to call for remedial education programs in desegregation plans. E. \ng., United States v. Texas, 447 F. 2d 441, 448 (1971), stay denied sub nom. Edgar v. United \n\nStates, 404 U. S. 1206 (1971) (Black, J., in chambers). To that end, the approved plan in United \nStates v. Texas required: \n\"[C]urriculum offerings and programs shall include specific educational programs designed to \ncompensate minority group children for unequal educational opportunities resulting from past or \npresent racial and ethnic isolation . . . .\" 447 F. 2d, at 448.[16] \nSee also George v. O'Kelly, 448 F. 2d 148, 150 (CA5 1971). And, as school desegregation litigation \nemerged in other 286*286 regions of the country, federal courts have likewise looked in part to \nremedial programs, when the record supported an order to that effect. See, e. \ng., Morgan v. Kerrigan, 401 F. Supp. 216, 235 (Mass. 1975), aff'd, 530 F. 2d 401 (CA1), cert. \ndenied sub nom. White v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 935 (1976); Hart v. Community School Board of \nBrooklyn, 383 F. Supp. 699, 757 (EDNY 1974), aff'd, 512 F. 2d 37 (CA2 1975); cf. Booker v. Special \nSchool Dist. 1, Minneapolis, Minn., 351 F. Supp. 799 (Minn. 1972).[17] \nFinally, in addition to other remedial programs, which could, if circumstances warranted, include \nprograms to remedy deficiencies, particularly in reading and communications skills, federal courts \nhave expressly ordered special in-service training for teachers, see, e. g., United \nStates v. Missouri, 523 F. 2d 885, 887 (CA8 1975); Smith v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, \nsupra, at 110; Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board, supra, at 253, and have altered or even \nsuspended testing programs employed by school systems undergoing desegregation. See, e. \ng., Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist., 419 F. 2d 1211, 1219 (CA5 1969), cert. \ndenied, 396 U. S. 1032 (1970); Lemon v. Bossier Parish School Board, 444 F. 2d 1400, 1401 (CA5 \n1971); Arvizu v. Waco Independent School Dist., 373 F. Supp. 1264 (WD Tex. 1973), rev'd in part on \nother issues, 495 F. 2d 499 (CA5 1974). \nOur reference to these cases is not to be taken as necessarily approving holdings not reviewed by \nthis Court. However, they demonstrate that the District Court in the case now 287*287 before us did \nnot break new ground in approving the School Board's proposed plan. Quite the contrary, acting on \nabundant evidence in this record, the District Court approved a remedial plan going beyond mere \npupil assignments, as expressly approved by Swann and Montgomery County. In so doing, the \nDistrict Court was adopting specific programs proposed by local school authorities, who must be \npresumed to be familiar with the problems and the needs of a system undergoing desegregation.[18] \nWe do not, of course, imply that the order here is a blueprint for other cases. That cannot be; in \nschool desegregation cases, \"[t]here is no universal answer to complex problems . . . ; there is \nobviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.\" Green, 391 U. S., at 439. On this record, \nhowever, we are bound to conclude that the decree before us was aptly tailored to remedy the \nconsequences of the constitutional violation. Children who have been thus educationally and \nculturally set apart from the larger community will inevitably acquire habits of speech, conduct, and \nattitudes reflecting their cultural isolation. They are likely to acquire speech habits, for example, \nwhich vary from the environment in which they must ultimately function and compete, if they are to \nenter and be a part of that community. This is not peculiar to race; in this setting, it can affect any \nchildren who, as a group, are isolated by force of law from the mainstream. Cf. Lau v. Nichols, 414 \nU. S. 563 (1974). \nPupil assignment alone does not automatically remedy the impact of previous, unlawful educational \nisolation; the consequences linger and can be dealt with only by independent 288*288 measures. In \nshort, speech habits acquired in a segregated system do not vanish simply by moving the child to a \ndesegregated school. The root condition shown by this record must be treated directly by special \ntraining at the hands of teachers prepared for that task. This is what the District Judge in the case \n\ndrew from the record before him as to the consequences of Detroit's de jure system, and we cannot \nconclude that the remedies decreed exceeded the scope of the violations found. \nNor do we find any other reason to believe that the broad and flexible equity powers of the court \nwere abused in this case. The established role of local school authorities was maintained inviolate, \nand the remedy is indeed remedial. The order does not punish anyone, nor does it impair or \njeopardize the educational system in Detroit.[19] The District Court, in short, was true to the principle \nlaid down in Brown II: \n\"In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. \nTraditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a \nfacility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs. These cases call for the exercise of \nthese traditional attributes of equity power.\" 349 U. S., at 300 (footnotes omitted). \nIII \nPetitioners also contend that the District Court's order, even if otherwise proper, violates the \nEleventh Amendment. In their view, the requirement that the state defendants pay one-half the \nadditional costs attributable to the four educational 289*289 components is, \"in practical effect, \nindistinguishable from an award of money damages against the state based upon the asserted prior \nmisconduct of state officials.\" Brief for Petitioners 34. Arguing from this premise, petitioners conclude \nthat the \"award\" in this case is barred under this Court's holding in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 \n(1974). \nEdelman involved a suit for money damages against the State, as well as for prospective injunctive \nrelief.[20] The suit was brought by an individual who claimed that Illinois officials had improperly \nwithheld disability benefit payments from him and from the members of his class. Applying traditional \nEleventh Amendment principles, we held that the suit was barred to the extent the suit sought \"the \naward of an accrued monetary liability . . .\" which represented \"retroactive payments.\" Id., at 663-\n664. (Emphasis supplied.) Conversely, the Court held that the suit was proper to the extent it sought \n\"payment of state funds . . . as a necessary consequence of compliance in the futurewith a \nsubstantive federal-question determination . . . .\" Id., at 668. (Emphasis supplied.) \nThe decree to share the future costs of educational components in this case fits squarely within the \nprospective-compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman. That exception, which had its genesis \nin Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), permits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform \ntheir conduct to requirements of federal law, notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the \nstate treasury. 415 U. S., at 667. The order challenged here does no more than that. The decree \nrequires state officials, held responsible for unconstitutional conduct, in findings which are not \nchallenged, to eliminate a de jure segregated school system. More precisely, the burden of state \nofficials is that set forth 290*290 in Swann—to take the necessary steps \"to eliminate from the public \nschools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation.\" 402 U. S., at 15. The educational components, \nwhich the District Court ordered into effect prospectively, are plainly designed to wipe out continuing \nconditions of inequality produced by the inherently unequal dual school system long maintained by \nDetroit.[21] \nThese programs were not, and as a practical matter could not be, intended to wipe the slate clean by \none bold stroke, as could a retroactive award of money in Edelman.[22]Rather, by the nature of the \nantecedent violation, which on this record caused significant deficiencies in communications skills— \nreading and speaking—the victims of Detroit's de jure segregated system will continue to experience \nthe effects of segregation until such future time as the remedial programs can help dissipate the \ncontinuing effects of past misconduct. Reading and speech deficiencies cannot be eliminated by \n\njudicial fiat; they will require time, patience, and the skills of specially trained teachers. That the \nprograms are also \"compensatory\" in nature does not change the fact that they are part of a plan \nthat operates prospectively to bring about the delayed benefits of a unitary school system. We \ntherefore hold that such prospective relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.[23] \n291*291 Finally, there is no merit to petitioners' claims that the relief ordered here violates the Tenth \nAmendment and general principles of federalism. The Tenth Amendment's reservation of \nnondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal-court judgment enforcing the \nexpress prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976). Nor are principles of federalism abrogated by the \ndecree. The District Court has neither attempted to restructure local governmental entities nor to \nmandate a particular method or structure of state or local financing. Cf. San Antonio School \nDist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1 (1973). The District Court has, rather, properly enforced the \nguarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment consistent with our prior holdings, and in a manner that \ndoes not jeopardize the integrity of the structure or functions of state and local government. \nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore \nAffirmed. \nMR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring. \nI wholeheartedly join THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S opinion for the Court. My Brother POWELL's opinion \nprompts these additional comments. \nWhat is, to me, most tragic about this case is that in all relevant respects it is in no way unique. That \na northern school board has been found guilty of intentionally discriminatory acts is, unfortunately, \nnot unusual. That the academic development of black children has been impaired by this \nwrongdoing is to be expected. And, therefore, that a program 292*292 of remediation is necessary to \nsupplement the primary remedy of pupil reassignment is inevitable. \nIt is of course true, as MR. JUSTICE POWELL notes, that the Detroit School Board has belatedly \nrecognized its responsibility for the injuries that Negroes have suffered, and has joined in the effort \nto remedy them. He may be right— although I hope not—that this makes the case \"wholly different \nfrom any prior case,\" post, this page. But I think it worth noting that the legal issues would be no \ndifferent if the Detroit School Board came to this Court on the other side. The question before us still \nwould be the one posed by the State: Is the remedy tailored to fit the scope of the violation? And, as \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE convincingly demonstrates, that question would have to be answered in the \naffirmative in light of the findings of the District Court, supported by abundant evidence. Cf. Dayton \nBoard of Education v. Brinkman, post, at 414. \nMR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring in the judgment. \nThe Court's opinion addresses this case as if it were conventional desegregation litigation. The wide-\nranging opinion reiterates the familiar general principles drawn from the line of precedents \ncommencing with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), and including today's decision \nin Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, post,p. 406. One has to read the opinion closely to \nunderstand that the case, as it finally reaches us, is wholly different from any prior case. I write to \nemphasize its uniqueness, and the consequent limited precedential effect of much of the Court's \nopinion. \n\nNormally, the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are students, parents, and supporting organizations \nthat desire to desegregate a school system alleged to be the product, in whole or in part, of de \njure segregative action by the public school authorities. The principal defendant is usually \nthe 293*293 local board of education or school board. Occasionally the state board of education and \nstate officials are joined as defendants. This protracted litigation commenced in 1970 in this \nconventional mold. In the intervening years, however, the posture of the litigation has changed so \ndrastically as to leave it largely a friendly suit between the plaintiffs (respondents Bradley et al.) and \nthe original principal defendant, the Detroit School Board. These parties, antagonistic for years, have \nnow joined forces apparently for the purpose of extracting funds from the state treasury. As between \nthe original principal parties—the plaintiffs and the Detroit School Board—no case or controversy \nremains on the issues now before us. The Board enthusiastically supports the entire desegregation \ndecree even though the decree intrudes deeply on the Board's own decisionmaking powers. Indeed, \nthe present School Board proposed most of the educational components included in the District \nCourt's decree. The plaintiffs originally favored a desegregation plan that would have required more \nextensive transportation of pupils, and they did not initially propose or endorse the educational \ncomponents. In this Court, however, the plaintiffs also support the decree of the District Court as \naffirmed by the Court of Appeals.[1] \nThus the only complaining party is the State of Michigan (acting through state officials) and its basic \ncomplaint concerns money, not desegregation. It has been ordered to pay about $5,800,000 to the \nDetroit School Board. This is one-half the estimated \"excess cost\" of 4 of the 11 educational \ncomponents 294*294 included in the desegregation decree: remedial reading, in-service training of \nteachers, testing, and counseling.[2] The State, understandably anxious to preserve the state budget \nfrom federal-court control or interference, now contests the decree on two grounds. \n295*295 First, it is argued that the order to pay state funds violates the Eleventh Amendment and \nprinciples of federalism. Ordinarily a federal court's order that a State pay unappropriated funds to a \nlocality would raise the gravest constitutional issues. See generally San Antonio School Dist. v. \nRodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 40-42 (1973); National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976). But \nhere, in a finding no longer subject to review, the State has been adjudged a participant in the \nconstitutional violations, and the State therefore may be ordered to participate prospectively in a \nremedy otherwise appropriate. \nThe State's second argument is one that normally would be advanced vigorously by the school \nboard. Relying on the established principle that the scope of the remedy in a desegregation case is \ndetermined and limited by the extent of the identified constitutional violations, Dayton Board of \nEducation, post, at 419-420; Hills v. Gautreaux,425 U. S. 284, 293-294 \n(1976); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 744 (1974); Austin Independent School Dist. v. United \nStates, 429 U. S. 990, 991 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), the State argues that the District Court \nerred in ordering the systemwide expansion of the four educational components mentioned above. It \ncontends that there has been no finding of a constitutional violation with respect to the past \noperation of any of these programs, and it insists that without more specifically focused findings of \nthis sort, the decree exceeded the court's powers. \nThis argument is by no means a frivolous one. But the context in which it is presented is so unusual \nthat it would be appropriate to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. The argument is advanced \nby the State and not by the party primarily concerned. The educational programs at issue are \nstandard and widely approved in public education. The State Board normally would be enthusiastic \nover enhancement of these programs so long as the local school board could 296*296 fund them \nwithout requiring financial aid from the State. It is equally evident that the State probably would resist \na federal-court order requiring it to pay unappropriated state funds to the local school board \nregardless of whether violations by the local board justified the remedy. The State's interest in \nprotecting its own budget—limited by legislative appropriations—is a genuine one. But it is not an \n\ninterest that is related, except fortuitously, to a claim that the desegregation remedy may have \nexceeded the extent of the violations. \nThe State's reliance on the remedy issue contains a further weakness, emphasizing the unusual \ncharacter of this case. There is no indication that the State objected—certainly, it does not object \nhere—to the inclusion in the District Court's decree of the seven other educational components. See \nn. 2, supra. Indeed, the State expressly agreed to one of the most expensive components, the \nestablishment of vocational education centers, in a stipulation obligating it to share the cost of \nconstruction equally with the Detroit Board. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a-144a. Furthermore, the \nDistrict Court's decree largely embodies the original recommendation of the Detroit Board. Since \nlocal school boards \"have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving [the] \nproblems\" generated by \"[f]ull implementation of . . . constitutional principles\" in the local \nsetting, Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 299 (1955), the State's limited challenge here is \nparticularly lacking in force. \nMoreover, the District Court was faced with a school district in exceptional disarray. It found the \nstructure of the Detroit school system \"chaotic and incapable of effective administration.\" App. to Pet. \nfor Cert. 124a. The \"general superintendent has little direct authority.\" Ibid. Each of the eight regional \nboards may be preoccupied with \"distribut[ing] local board patronage.\" Id., at 125a. The \"local \nboards have diverted resources that would otherwise have been 297*297 available for educational \npurposes to build new offices and other facilities to house this administrative overload.\" Ibid. The \nDistrict Court continued: \n\"In addition to the administrative chaos, we know of no other school system that is so enmeshed in \npolitics. . . . \n\". . . Rather than devoting themselves to the educational system and the desegregative process, \nboard members are busily engaged in politics not only to assure their own re-election but also to \ndefeat others with whom they disagree.\" Id., at 125a-126a (footnote omitted). \nReferring again to the \"political paralysis\" and \"inefficient bureaucracy\" of the system, the court also \nnoted—discouragingly—that the election then approaching \"may well [result in] a board of education \nconsisting of members possessing no experience in education.\" Id., at 126a. In this quite remarkable \nsituation, it is perhaps not surprising that the District Court virtually assumed the role of school \nsuperintendent and school board.[3] \n298*298 Given the foregoing unique circumstances, it seems to me that the proper disposition of this \ncase is to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. But as the Court has chosen to \ndecide the case here, I join in the judgment as a result less likely to prolong the disruption of \neducation in Detroit than a reversal or remand. Despite wide-ranging dicta in the Court's opinion, the \nonly issue decided is that the District Court's findings as to specific constitutional violations justified \nthe four remedial educational components included in the desegregation decree. In my view, it is at \nleast arguable that the findings in this respect were too generalized to meet the standards prescribed \nby this Court. See Dayton Board of Education, post, p. 406. But the majority views the record as \njustifying the conclusion that \"the need for educational components flowed directly from \nconstitutional violations by both state and local officials.\" Ante, at 282.[4] On that view of the record, \nour settled doctrine requiring that the remedy be carefully tailored to fit identified constitutional \nviolations is reaffirmed by today's result. I therefore concur in the judgment. \n[*] Robert P. Kane, Attorney General, and Jeffrey Cooper and J. Justin Blewitt, Deputy Attorneys General, filed a brief for the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania as amicus curiae urging reversal. \n\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Acting Solicitor General Friedman, Assistant Attorney General Days, \nDeputy Solicitor General Wallace, Brian K. Landsberg, and Judith E. Wolf for the United States; and by Herbert Teitelbaum, \nRobert Hermann, and Vilma Martinez for Aspira of America, Inc., et al. \nJohn L. Hill, Attorney General, David M. Kendall, First Assistant Attorney General, and Thomas W. Choate,Special Assistant \nAttorney General, filed a brief for the State of Texas as amicus curiae. \n[1] The violations of the Detroit Board of Education, which included the improper use of optional attendance zones, racially \nbased transportation of schoolchildren, improper creation and alteration of attendance zones, grade structures, and feeder \nschool patterns, are described in the District Court's initial \"Ruling on Issue of Segregation.\" 338 F. Supp. 582, 587-588 (ED \nMich. 1971). The District Court further found that \"[t]he State and its agencies . . . have acted directly to control and maintain \nthe pattern of segregation in the Detroit schools.\" Id.,at 589. Indeed, when the Detroit School Board attempted to voluntarily \ninitiate an intradistrict remedy to ameliorate the effect of the past segregation practices, the Michigan Legislature enacted a \nlaw forbidding the carrying out of this remedy. Those conclusions as to liability were affirmed on appeal, 484 F. 2d 215, 221-\n241 (CA6 1973), and were not challenged in this Court. 418 U. S. 717 (1974) (Milliken I). \n[2] Separate opinions were filed in Milliken I. MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring, stated that the metropolitanwide remedy \ncontemplated by the District Court was \"in error for the simple reason that the remedy . . . was not commensurate with the \nconstitutional violation found.\" 418 U. S., at 754. Dissenting opinions were filed by Mr. Justice Douglas, MR. JUSTICE \nWHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL. The dissenting opinions took the position, in brief, that the remedy was appropriate, \ngiven the State's undisputed constitutional violations, the control of local education by state authorities, and the \nmanageability of any necessary administrative modifications to effectuate a metropolitanwide remedy. \n[3] According to the then most recent statistical data, as of September 27, 1974, 257,396 students were enrolled in the \nDetroit public schools, a figure which reflected a decrease of 28,116 students in the system since the 1960-1961 school \nyear. 402 F. Supp. 1096, 1106-1107 (1975). Of this total student population, 71.5% were Negro and 26.4% were white. The \nremaining 2.1% were composed of students of other ethnic groups. Id., at 1106. \n[4] Under respondent Bradley's proposed plan in the remand proceedings, 71,349 students would have required \ntransportation; the Detroit Board's plan, however, provided for transportation of 51,000 students, 20,000 less than the \nBradley plan. The Board's plan, which the District Court found infirm because of an impermissible use of \"arbitrary\" racial \nquotas, contemplated achieving a 40%-60% representation of Negro students in the identifiably white schools, while leaving \nuntouched in terms of pupil reassignment schools in three of the Detroit system's eight regions. Those three regions, which \nwere located in the central city, were overwhelmingly Negro in racial composition. \n[5] The fourth component, a remedial reading and communications skills program, was proposed later and was endorsed by \nthe Bradley respondents in a critique of the Detroit Board's proposed plan. See n. 7, infra. The Board's plan also called for \nthe following \"educational components\": school-community relations, parental involvement, student rights and \nresponsibilities, accountability, curriculum design, bilingual education, multiethnic curriculum, and cocurricular activities. 402 \nF. Supp., at 1118. \n[6] In addition to the State Board of Education, the state defendants include the Governor of Michigan, the Attorney General, \nthe State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the State Treasurer. \n[7] Two months later, the Bradley respondents also submitted a critique of the Board's plan; while criticizing the Board's \nproposed educational components on several grounds, respondents nonetheless suggested that a remedial reading \nprogram was particularly needed in a desegregation plan. See n. 5, supra. The Bradley respondents claimed more generally \nthat the Board's plan failed to inform the court of the then-current extent of such programs or components in the school \nsystem and that the plan failed to assess \"the relatedness of the particular component to desegregation.\" \n[8] The other state defendants likewise filed objections to the Detroit Board's plan on April 21, 1975. They contended, in \nbrief, that the court's remedy was limited to pupil reassignment to achieve desegregation; hence, the proposed inclusion of \neducational components was, in their view, excessive. \n[9] For example, Dr. Charles P. Kearney, Associate Superintendent for Research and School Administration for the Michigan \nDepartment of Education, gave the following testimony: \n\"[T]he State Board and the Superintendent indicated that guidance and counselling appeared to deserve special emphasis \nin a desegregation effort. \n\n\"We support the notion of a guidance and counselling effort. We think it certainly does have a relationship in the \ndesegregation effort, we think it deserves special emphasis.\" 30 Record, Tr. 126, 129. \nAs to in-service training, Dr. Kearney testified that, in his opinion, such a program was required to implement effectively a \ndesegregation plan in Detroit. Id., at 179, 187. Finally, even though the State's critique did not deem testing as deserving of \n\"special emphasis\" in the desegregation plan, Dr. Kearney stated as follows: \n\"Q: [D]o you see a direct relationship between testing and desegregation? \n\"A: If test results were inappropriately used, . . . I think it would have certainly a discriminatory affect [sic] and it would have a \nnegative affect [sic], I'm sure on any kind of desegregation plan being implemented.\" Id., at 184. \n[10] The District Court did not approve of all aspects of the Detroit Board's plan. With respect to educational components, \nthe court said: \"The plan as submitted . . . does not distinguish between those components that are necessary to the \nsuccessful implementation of a desegregation plan and those that are not.\" 402 F. Supp., at 1118. (Emphasis supplied.) \n[11] In contrast to their position before the District Court with respect to the four educational components at issue here, the \nstate defendants, through the State Board of Education, voluntarily entered into a stipulation with the Detroit Board on \nFebruary 24, 1976, under which the State agreed to provide 50% of the construction costs of five vocational centers which \nthe District Court ordered to be established. App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a-141a. \n[12] The Court of Appeals disapproved, however, of the District Court's failure to include three of Detroit's eight regions in \nthe pupil assignment plan. See n. 4, supra. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for further \nconsideration of the three omitted regions, but declined to set forth guidelines, given the practicabilities of the situation, for \nthe District Court's benefit. Further proceedings were deemed appropriate, however, particularly since the Bradley \nrespondents had previously been granted leave to file a second amended complaint to allege interdistrict violations on the \npart of the state and local defendants. \n[13] In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1 (1971), the Court affirmed an order of the District \nCourt which included a requirement of in-service training programs. 318 F. Supp. 786, 803 (WDNC 1970). However, this \nCourt's opinion did not treat the precise point. In Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo.,413 U. S. 189 (1973), the Court \nexpressly avoided passing on the District Court's holding that called for, among other things, \"compensatory education in an \nintegrated environment.\" Id., at 214 n. 18. \n[14] Thus, the Court has consistently held that the Constitution is not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without \nmore. Pasadena Bd. of Education v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 434 (1976); Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 763 (WHITE, J., \ndissenting); Swann, supra, at 26. An order contemplating the \"`substantive constitutional right [to a] particular degree of \nracial balance or mixing'\" is therefore infirm as a matter of law. Spangler, supra, at 434. \n[15] Since the ultimate objective of the remedy is to make whole the victims of unlawful conduct, federal courts are \nauthorized to implement plans that promise \"realistically to work now.\" Green v. County School Bd., 391 U. S. 430, 439 \n(1968). At the same time, the Court has carefully stated that, to ensure that federal-court decrees are characterized by the \nflexibility and sensitivity required of equitable decrees, consideration must be given to burdensome effects resulting from a \ndecree that could \"either risk the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process.\" Swann, supra, at \n30-31. Our function, as stated by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, is \"to desegregate an educational system in which the races have \nbeen kept apart, without, at the same time, losing sight of the central educational function of the schools.\" Milliken I, \nsupra, at 764 (dissenting opinion). (Emphasis in original.) In a word, \"[t]here are undoubted practical as well as legal limits to \nthe remedial powers of federal courts in school desegregation cases.\" 418 U. S., at 763. Cf. Austin Independent School \nDist. v. United States, 429 U. S. 990, 991 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring). \n[16] In denying the stay application, Mr. Justice Black was untroubled by the underlying order of the District Court: \n\"It would be very difficult for me to suspend the order of the District Court that, in my view, does no more than endeavor to \nrealize the directive of the Fourteenth Amendment and the decisions of this Court that racial discrimination in the public \nschools must be eliminated root and branch.\" 404 U. S., at 1207. \n[17] We do not, of course, pass upon the correctness of the particular holdings of cases we did not review. We simply note \nthat these holdings support the broader proposition that, when the record warrants, remedial programs may, in the exercise \nof equitable discretion, be appropriate remedies to treat the condition that offends the Constitution. Of course, it must always \nbe shown that the constitutional violation caused the condition for which remedial programs are mandated. \n\n[18] This Court has from the beginning looked to the District Courts in desegregation cases, familiar as they are with the \nlocal situations coming before them, to appraise the efforts of local school authorities to carry out their constitutionally \nrequired duties. \"Because of their proximity to local conditions . . . the [federal district] courts which originally heard these \ncases can best perform this judicial appraisal.\" Brown II, 349 U. S., at 299. \n[19] Indeed, the District Judge took great pains to devise a workable plan with a minimum of pupil transportation. For \nexample, he sought carefully to eliminate burdensome transportation of Negro children to predominantly Negro schools and \nto prevent the disruption, by massive pupil reassignment, of racially mixed schools in stable neighborhoods which had \nsuccessfully undergone residential and educational change. \n[20] Although the complaint in Edelman ostensibly sought only equitable relief, the plaintiff expressly requested \"`a \npermanent injunction enjoining the defendants to award to the entire class of plaintiffs all [disability] benefits wrongfully \nwithheld.'\" 415 U. S., at 656. \n[21] Unlike the award in Edelman, the injunction entered here could not instantaneously restore the victims of unlawful \nconduct to their rightful condition. Thus, the injunction here looks to the future, not simply to presently compensating victims \nfor conduct and consequences completed in the past. \n[22] In contrast to Edelman, there was no money award here in favor of respondent Bradley or any members of his class. \nThis case simply does not involve individual citizens' conducting a raid on the state treasury for an accrued monetary \nliability. The order here is wholly prospective in the same manner that the decree mandates vocational schools and \nassignments, for example. \n[23] Because of our conclusion, we do not reach either of the two alternative arguments in support of the District Court's \njudgment, namely, that the State of Michigan expressly waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by virtue of Mich. Stat. \nAnn. § 15.1023 (7) (1975), and that the Fourteenth Amendment, ex proprio vigore, works a pro tanto repeal of the Eleventh \nAmendment. Cf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976). Neither question was addressed by the Court of Appeals, and \nwe therefore do not pass on either issue. \n[1] Until the case reached this Court the plaintiffs apparently did not view the educational components as necessary or even \nimportant elements of a desegregation plan. These components were not included in plans submitted by the plaintiffs, and in \nbriefs filed below there were indications that the plaintiffs viewed some—if not all—of these components as being \"wholly \nunrelated to desegregation of students and faculty in schools.\" Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants 5 n. 6 in the Court of Appeals, \nNo. 75-2018 (filed Dec. 29, 1975). \n[2] In addition to these four components, there were some seven other educational directives that are not contested here. \n(The details are set forth in the opinions and decrees of August 15, 1975, November 4 and 20, 1975, and May 11, 1976, all \nof which are reproduced in full in the appendix to the petition for certiorari. The first two such opinions also have been \npublished. 402 F. Supp. 1096; 411 F. Supp. 943.) Perhaps the most expansive component was the District Court's order that \nthe city and state boards create five vocational centers \"devoted to in-depth occupational preparation in the construction \ntrades, transportation and health services.\" 402 F. Supp., at 1140. As noted in the text, infra, at 296, a compromise was \nreached as to these centers and the State entered into a stipulation obligating it to share the cost of providing them. See \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 139a-144a. The other educational components ordered by the District Court included: (i) \"two new \ntechnical high schools in which business education will be the central part of the curriculum,\" App. 75a; (ii) a new curriculum \nfor the vocational education courses in the Detroit schools, including the requirement that an additional \"grade 13\" be added \nto afford expanded educational opportunities, 402 F. Supp., at 1140; (iii) the inclusion of \"multi-ethnic studies\" in the \ncurriculum, with a request for federal funds to support \"in-service training for teachers involved in such programs,\" id., at \n1144, App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a; (iv) a \"Uniform Code of Conduct,\" which the Board was ordered to develop pursuant to \nguidelines established by the court, 402 F. Supp., at 1142, App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a; (v) a specific plan for \"cocurricular \nactivities\" with other artistic and educational institutions in the area, to be developed by the Board and submitted for court \napproval, 402 F. Supp., at 1143; and (vi) a \"community relations program\" prescribed in remarkable detail by the \ncourt. Ibid., App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a-135a. \nIn most, if not all, instances the court ordered that each of these programs be \"comprehensive,\" and that reports be made to \nthe court. One may doubt whether there is any precedent for a federal court's exercising such extensive control over the \npurely educational responsibilities of a school board. \n[3] It merits emphasizing that the School Board invited this assumption of power. Indeed, the District Court had \ncomplimented the Board on its willingness to \"implement any desegregation order the court may issue.\" 402 F. Supp., at \n1125. But at one point there were serious second thoughts. In its brief in the Court of Appeals, the Board expressed grave \nconcern as to what the District Court's assumption of the Board's powers could do to the school system financially: \n\n\"[O]n May 11, 1976 . . . the District Court ordered equalization of all school facilities and buildings preparatory to the 1976-77 \nschool term; continuance of the comprehensive construction and renovation program; [and implementation of the \neducational components summarized in n. 2, supra]. . . . \n\"Even without actual dollar figures, the financial impact of these orders could easily destroy the educational program of the \nDetroit school system. The financing of these components by the Detroit school system The financing of these components \nby the Detroit school system would only mean a concomitant elimination of existing programs. \n\"It is virtually impossible for the Detroit Board of Education to re-order its priorities when it is already operating on a woefully \ninadequate budget that cannot provide a minimal quality educational program. Any attempt to redistribute available \nresources will cause further deterioration in on-going educational programs and will merely result in robbing Peter to pay \nPaul.\" Reprinted in the Appendix to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 540 F. 2d 229, 250-251 (CA6) (emphasis added). \nTo say the least, the financial impact of the court's decree was profoundly disturbing. But apparently the financially pressed \nBoard was willing to surrender a substantial portion of its decisionmaking authority in return for the prospect of enhanced \nstate funding. For by the time it made this statement to the Court of Appeals, the Board knew that the District Court had \nexercised its power to do what the state legislature had chosen not to do: appropriate funds from the state treasury for these \nparticular programs of the Detroit schools. \n[4] The Court's opinion states, for example, that the District Court \"expressly found that the two components of testing and \ncounseling, as then administered in Detroit's schools, were infected with the discriminatory bias of a segregated school \nsystem.\" Ante, at 274-275. \n ",

Lord filed a brief for \nrespondents Green et al. \nSolicitor General Bork argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal. With \nhim on the brief was Assistant Attorney General Pottinger.[†] \nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \nWe granted certiorari in these consolidated cases to determine whether a federal court may impose \na multidistrict, areawide remedy to a single-district de jure segregation problem absent any finding \nthat the other included school districts have failed to operate unitary school systems within their \ndistricts, absent any claim or finding that the boundary lines of any affected school district were \nestablished with the purpose of fostering racial segregation in public schools, absent any finding that \nthe included districts committed acts which effected segregation within the other districts, and absent \na 722*722 meaningful opportunity for the included neighboring school districts to present evidence or \nbe heard on the propriety of a multidistrict remedy or on the question of constitutional violations by \nthose neighboring districts.[1] \nI \n\nThe action was commenced in August 1970 by the respondents, the Detroit Branch of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People[2] and individual parents and students, on behalf \nof a class later defined by order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan, dated February 16, 1971, to include \"all school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, \nand all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age.\" The named defendants in the \nDistrict Court included the Governor of Michigan, the Attorney General, the State Board of \nEducation, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Board of Education of the city of \nDetroit, its members, and the city's former superintendent of schools. The State of Michigan as such \nis not a party to this litigation and references to the State must be read as references to the public \nofficials, state and local, through whom the State is alleged to have acted. In their complaint \nrespondents attacked the constitutionality of a statute of the State of Michigan known as Act 48 of \nthe 1970 Legislature on the ground that it put the State of Michigan in the position of \nunconstitutionally interfering with the execution and operation of a voluntary plan of partial high \nschool desegregation, known as the April 7, 1970, Plan, which had been adopted by the Detroit \nBoard of Education to be effective beginning 723*723 with the fall 1970 semester. The complaint \nalso alleged that the Detroit Public School System was and is segregated on the basis of race as a \nresult of the official policies and actions of the defendants and their predecessors in office, and \ncalled for the implementation of a plan that would eliminate \"the racial identity of every school in the \n[Detroit] system and . . . maintain now and hereafter a unitary, nonracial school system.\" \nInitially the matter was tried on respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the \nenforcement of Act 48 so as to permit the April 7 Plan to be implemented. On that issue, the District \nCourt ruled that respondents were not entitled to a preliminary injunction since at that stage there \nwas no proof that Detroit had a dual segregated school system. On appeal, the Court of Appeals \nfound that the \"implementation of the April 7 plan was [unconstitutionally] thwarted by State action in \nthe form of the Act of the Legislature of Michigan,\" 433 F. 2d 897, 902 (CA6 1970), and that such \naction could not be interposed to delay, obstruct, or nullify steps lawfully taken for the purpose of \nprotecting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the District \nCourt for an expedited trial on the merits. \nOn remand, the respondents moved for immediate implementation of the April 7 Plan in order to \nremedy the deprivation of the claimed constitutional rights. In response, the School Board suggested \ntwo other plans, along with the April 7 Plan, and urged that top priority be assigned to the so-called \n\"Magnet Plan\" which was \"designed to attract children to a school because of its superior \ncurriculum.\" The District Court approved the Board's Magnet Plan, and respondents again appealed \nto the Court of Appeals, moving for summary reversal. The Court of Appeals refused to pass on the \nmerits of the Magnet Plan and ruled that the District Court had 724*724 not abused its discretion in \nrefusing to adopt the April 7 Plan without an evidentiary hearing. The case was again remanded with \ninstructions to proceed immediately to a trial on the merits of respondents' substantive allegations \nconcerning the Detroit school system. 438 F. 2d 945 (CA6 1971). \nThe trial of the issue of segregation in the Detroit school system began on April 6, 1971, and \ncontinued through July 22, 1971, consuming some 41 trial days. On September 27, 1971, the District \nCourt issued its findings and conclusions on the issue of segregation, finding that \"Governmental \nactions and inaction at all levels, federal, state and local, have combined, with those of private \norganizations, such as loaning institutions and real estate associations and brokerage firms, to \nestablish and to maintain the pattern of residential segregation throughout the Detroit metropolitan \narea.\" 338 F. Supp. 582, 587 (ED Mich. 1971). While still addressing a Detroit-only violation, the \nDistrict Court reasoned: \n\"While it would be unfair to charge the present defendants with what other governmental officers or \nagencies have done, it can be said that the actions or the failure to act by the responsible school \nauthorities, both city and state, were linked to that of these other governmental units. When we \n\nspeak of governmental action we should not view the different agencies as a collection of unrelated \nunits. Perhaps the most that can be said is that all of them, including the school authorities, are, in \npart, responsible for the segregated condition which exists. And we note that just as there is an \ninteraction between residential patterns and the racial composition of the schools, so there is a \ncorresponding effect on the residential pattern by the racial composition of the schools.\" Ibid. \n725*725 The District Court found that the Detroit Board of Education created and maintained optional \nattendance zones[3] within Detroit neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high \nschool attendance areas of opposite predominant racial compositions. These zones, the court found, \nhad the \"natural, probable, foreseeable and actual effect\" of allowing white pupils to escape \nidentifiably Negro schools. Ibid. Similarly, the District Court found that Detroit school attendance \nzones had been drawn along north-south boundary lines despite the Detroit Board's awareness that \ndrawing boundary lines in an east-west direction would result in significantly greater desegregation. \nAgain, the District Court concluded, the natural and actual effect of these acts was the creation and \nperpetuation of school segregation within Detroit. \nThe District Court found that in the operation of its school transportation program, which was \ndesigned to relieve overcrowding, the Detroit Board had admittedly bused Negro Detroit pupils to \npredominantly Negro schools which were beyond or away from closer white schools with available \nspace.[4] This practice was found to have continued in recent years despite the Detroit Board's \navowed policy, adopted in 1967, of utilizing transportation to increase desegregation: \n\"With one exception (necessitated by the burning of a white school), defendant Board has never \nbused 726*726 white children to predominantly black schools. The Board has not bused white pupils \nto black schools despite the enormous amount of space available in inner-city schools. There were \n22,961 vacant seats in schools 90% or more black.\" Id., at 588. \nWith respect to the Detroit Board of Education's practices in school construction, the District Court \nfound that Detroit school construction generally tended to have a segregative effect with the great \nmajority of schools being built in either overwhelmingly all-Negro or all-white neighborhoods so that \nthe new schools opened as predominantly one-race schools. Thus, of the 14 schools which opened \nfor use in 1970-1971, 11 opened over 90% Negro and one opened less than 10% Negro. \nThe District Court also found that the State of Michigan had committed several constitutional \nviolations with respect to the exercise of its general responsibility for, and supervision of, public \neducation.[5] The State, for example, was found to have failed, until the 1971 Session of the Michigan \nLegislature, to provide authorization or 727*727 funds for the transportation of pupils within Detroit \nregardless of their poverty or distance from the school to which they were assigned; during this \nsame period the State provided many neighboring, mostly white, suburban districts the full range of \nstate-supported transportation. \nThe District Court found that the State, through Act 48, acted to \"impede, delay and minimize racial \nintegration in Detroit schools.\" The first sentence of § 12 of Act 48 was designed to delay the April 7, \n1970, desegregation plan originally adopted by the Detroit Board. The remainder of § 12 sought to \nprescribe for each school in the eight districts criteria of \"free choice\" and \"neighborhood schools,\" \nwhich, the District Court found, \"had as their purpose and effect the maintenance of segregation.\" \n338 F. Supp., at 589.[6] \nThe District Court also held that the acts of the Detroit Board of Education, as a subordinate entity of \nthe State, were attributable to the State of Michigan, thus creating a vicarious liability on the part of \nthe State. Under Michigan law, Mich. Comp. Laws § 388.851 (1970), for example, school building \nconstruction plans had to be approved by the State Board of Education, and, prior to 1962, the State \n\nBoard had specific statutory authority to supervise schoolsite selection. The proofs concerning the \neffect of Detroit's school construction program were, 728*728 therefore, found to be largely \napplicable to show state responsibility for the segregative results.[7] \nTurning to the question of an appropriate remedy for these several constitutional violations, the \nDistrict Court deferred a pending motion[8] by intervening parent defendants 729*729 to join as \nadditional parties defendant the 85 outlying school districts in the three-county Detroit metropolitan \narea on the ground that effective relief could not be achieved without their presence.[9] The District \nCourt concluded that this motion to join was \"premature,\" since it \"has to do with relief\" and no \nreasonably specific desegregation plan was before the court. 338 F. Supp., at 595. Accordingly, the \nDistrict Court proceeded to order the Detroit Board of Education to submit desegregation plans \nlimited to the segregation problems found to be existing within the city of Detroit. At the same time, \nhowever, the state defendants were directed to submit desegregation plans encompassing the \nthree-county metropolitan area[10] despite the fact that the 85 outlying school 730*730 districts of \nthese three counties were not parties to the action and despite the fact that there had been no claim \nthat these outlying districts had committed constitutional violations.[11] An effort to appeal these \norders to the Court of Appeals was dismissed on the ground that the orders were not appealable. \n468 F. 2d 902 (CA6), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 844 (1972). The sequence of the ensuing actions and \norders of the District Court are significant factors and will therefore be catalogued in some detail. \nFollowing the District Court's abrupt announcement that it planned to consider the implementation of \na multidistrict, metropolitan area remedy to the segregation problems identified within the city of \nDetroit, the District Court was again requested to grant the outlying school districts intervention as of \nright on the ground that the District Court's new request for multidistrict plans \"may, as a practical \nmatter, impair or impede [the intervenors'] ability to protect\" the welfare of their students. The District \nCourt took the motions to intervene under advisement pending submission of the requested \ndesegregation plans by Detroit and the state officials. On March 7, 1972, the District Court notified \nall parties and the petitioner school districts seeking intervention, that March 14, 1972, was the \ndeadline for submission of recommendations for conditions of intervention and the 731*731 date of \nthe commencement of hearings on Detroit-only desegregation plans. On the second day of the \nscheduled hearings, March 15, 1972, the District Court granted the motions of the intervenor school \ndistricts[12] subject, inter alia,to the following conditions: \n\"1. No intervenor will be permitted to assert any claim or defense previously adjudicated by the court. \n\"2. No intervenor shall reopen any question or issue which has previously been decided by the court. \n..... \n\"7. New intervenors are granted intervention for two principal purposes: (a) To advise the court, by \nbrief, of the legal propriety or impropriety of considering a metropolitan plan; (b) To review any plan \nor plans for the desegregation of the so-called larger Detroit Metropolitan area, and submitting \nobjections, modifications or alternatives to it or them, and in accordance with the requirements of the \nUnited States Constitution and the prior orders of this court.\" 1 Joint Appendix 206 (hereinafter \nApp.). \nUpon granting the motion to intervene, on March 15, 1972, the District Court advised the petitioning \nintervenors that the court had previously set March 22, 1972, as the date for the filing of briefs on the \nlegal propriety of a \"metropolitan\" plan of desegregation and, accordingly, that the intervening school \ndistricts would have one week to muster their legal arguments on the issue.[13] 732*732 Thereafter, \nand following the completion of hearings on the Detroit-only desegregation plans, the District Court \nissued the four rulings that were the principal issues in the Court of Appeals. \n(a) On March 24, 1972, two days after the intervenors' briefs were due, the District Court issued its \nruling on the question of whether it could \"consider relief in the form of a metropolitan plan, \n\nencompassing not only the City of Detroit, but the larger Detroit metropolitan area.\" It rejected the \nstate defendants' arguments that no state action caused the segregation of the Detroit schools, and \nthe intervening suburban districts' contention that interdistrict relief was inappropriate unless the \nsuburban districts themselves had committed violations. The court concluded: \n\"[I]t is proper for the court to consider metropolitan plans directed toward the desegregation of the \nDetroit public schools as an alternative to the present intra-city desegregation plans before it and, in \nthe event that the court finds such intra-city plans inadequate to desegregate such schools, the court \nis of the opinion that it is required to consider a metropolitan remedy for desegregation.\" Pet. App. \n51a. \n(b) On March 28, 1972, the District Court issued its findings and conclusions on the three Detroit-\nonly plans submitted by the city Board and the respondents. It found that the best of the three plans \n\"would make the Detroit school system more identifiably Black . . . thereby increasing the flight of \nWhites from the city and the system.\" Id., at 55a. From this the court concluded that the plan \"would \nnot accomplish desegregation. . . within the corporate geographical limits of the city.\" Id., at 56a. \nAccordingly, the District Court held that it \"must look beyond the limits of the Detroit \nschool 733*733 district for a solution to the problem,\" and that \"[s]chool district lines are simply \nmatters of political convenience and may not be used to deny constitutional rights.\" Id., at 57a. \n(c) During the period from March 28 to April 14, 1972, the District Court conducted hearings on a \nmetropolitan plan. Counsel for the petitioning intervenors was allowed to participate in these \nhearings, but he was ordered to confine his argument to \"the size and expanse of the metropolitan \nplan\" without addressing the intervenors' opposition to such a remedy or the claim that a finding of a \nconstitutional violation by the intervenor districts was an essential predicate to any remedy involving \nthem. Thereafter, on June 14, 1972, the District Court issued its ruling on the \"desegregation area\" \nand related findings and conclusions. The court acknowledged at the outset that it had \"taken no \nproofs with respect to the establishment of the boundaries of the 86 public school districts in the \ncounties [in the Detroit area], nor on the issue of whether, with the exclusion of the city of Detroit \nschool district, such school districts have committed acts of de jure segregation.\" Nevertheless, the \ncourt designated 53 of the 85 suburban school districts plus Detroit as the \"desegregation area\" and \nappointed a panel to prepare and submit \"an effective desegregation plan\" for the Detroit schools \nthat would encompass the entire desegregation area.[14] The plan was to be based on 15 clusters, \neach containing part of the Detroit system and two or more suburban districts, 734*734 and was to \n\"achieve the greatest degree of actual desegregation to the end that, upon implementation, no \nschool, grade or classroom [would be] substantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial \ncomposition.\" 345 F. Supp. 914, 918 (ED Mich. 1972). \n(d) On July 11, 1972, and in accordance with a recommendation by the court-appointed \ndesegregation panel, the District Court ordered the Detroit Board of Education to purchase or lease \n\"at least\" 295 school buses for the purpose of providing transportation under an interim plan to be \ndeveloped for the 1972-1973 school year. The costs of this acquisition were to be borne by the state \ndefendants. Pet. App. 106a-107a. \nOn June 12, 1973, a divided Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, affirmed in part, vacated in part, and \nremanded for further proceedings. 484 F. 2d 215 (CA6).[15] The Court of Appeals held, first, that the \nrecord supported the District Court's findings and conclusions on the constitutional violations \ncommitted by the Detroit Board, id., at 221-238, and by the state defendants, id., at 239-241.[16] It \nstated that the acts of racial discrimination 735*735 shown in the record are \"causally related to the \nsubstantial amount of segregation found in the Detroit school system,\" id., at 241, and that \"the \nDistrict Court was therefore authorized and required to take effective measures to desegregate the \nDetroit Public School System.\" Id., at 242. \n\nThe Court of Appeals also agreed with the District Court that \"any less comprehensive a solution \nthan a metropolitan area plan would result in an all black school system immediately surrounded by \npractically all white suburban school systems, with an overwhelmingly white majority population in \nthe total metropolitan area.\" Id., at 245. The court went on to state that it could \"not see how such \nsegregation can be any less harmful to the minority students than if the same result were \naccomplished within one school district.\" Ibid. \nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"the only feasible desegregation plan involves the \ncrossing of the boundary lines between the Detroit School District and adjacent or nearby school \ndistricts for the limited purpose of providing an effective desegregation plan.\" Id., at 249. It reasoned \nthat such a plan would be appropriate because of the State's violations, and could be implemented \nbecause of the State's authority to control local school districts. Without further elaboration, and \nwithout any discussion of the claims that no constitutional violation by the outlying districts had \nbeen 736*736 shown and that no evidence on that point had been allowed, the Court of Appeals \nheld: \n\"[T]he State has committed de jure acts of segregation and . . . the State controls the \ninstrumentalities whose action is necessary to remedy the harmful effects of the State acts.\" Ibid. \nAn interdistrict remedy was thus held to be \"within the equity powers of the District Court.\" Id., at \n250.[17] \nThe Court of Appeals expressed no views on the propriety of the District Court's composition of the \nmetropolitan \"desegregation area.\" It held that all suburban school districts that might be affected by \nany metropolitanwide remedy should, under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19, be made parties to the case on \nremand and be given an opportunity to be heard with respect to the scope and implementation of \nsuch a remedy. 484 F. 2d, at 251-252. Under the terms of the remand, however, the District Court \nwas not \"required\" to receive further evidence on the issue of segregation in the Detroit schools or \non the propriety of a Detroit-only remedy, or on the question of whether the affected districts had \ncommitted any violation of the constitutional rights of Detroit pupils or others. Id., at 252. Finally, the \nCourt of Appeals vacated the District Court's order directing the acquisition of school buses, subject \nto the right of the District Court to consider reimposing the order \"at the appropriate time.\" Ibid. \n737*737 II \nEver since Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), judicial consideration of school \ndesegregation cases has begun with the standard: \n\"[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate \neducational facilities are inherently unequal.\" Id., at 495. \nThis has been reaffirmed time and again as the meaning of the Constitution and the controlling rule \nof law. \nThe target of the Brown holding was clear and forthright: the elimination of state-mandated or \ndeliberately maintained dual school systems with certain schools for Negro pupils and others for \nwhite pupils. This duality and racial segregation were held to violate the Constitution in the cases \nsubsequent to 1954, including particularly Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 \nU. S. 430 (1968); Raney v. Board of Education,391 U. S. 443 (1968); Monroe v. Board of \nComm'rs, 391 U. S. 450 (1968); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1 \n\n(1971); Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451 (1972); United States v. Scotland \nNeck Board of Education, 407 U. S. 484 (1972). \nThe Swann case, of course, dealt \n\"with the problem of defining in more precise terms than heretofore the scope of the duty of school \nauthorities and district courts in implementing Brown I and the mandate to eliminate dual systems \nand establish unitary systems at once.\" 402 U. S., at 6. \nIn Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (1955) (Brown II), the Court's first encounter with the \nproblem of remedies in school desegregation cases, the Court noted: \n\"In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. \nTraditionally, 738*738 equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies \nand by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.\" Id., at 300 (footnotes \nomitted). \nIn further refining the remedial process, Swann held, the task is to correct, by a balancing of the \nindividual and collective interests, \"the condition that offends the Constitution.\" A federal remedial \npower may be exercised \"only on the basis of a constitutional violation\" and, \"[a]s with any equity \ncase, the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\" 402 U. S., at 16. \nProceeding from these basic principles, we first note that in the District Court the complainants \nsought a remedy aimed at the condition alleged to offend the Constitution—the segregation within \nthe Detroit City School District.[18] The court acted on this theory of the case and in its initial ruling on \nthe \"Desegregation Area\" stated: \n\"The task before this court, therefore, is now, and . . . has always been, how to desegregate the \nDetroit public schools.\" 345 F. Supp., at 921. \nThereafter, however, the District Court abruptly rejected the proposed Detroit-only plans on the \nground that \"while [they] would provide a racial mix more in keeping with the Black-White proportions \nof the student population [they] would accentuate the racial identifiability of the 739*739 [Detroit] \ndistrict as a Black school system, and would not accomplish desegregation.\" Pet. App. 56a. \"[T]he \nracial composition of the student body is such,\" said the court, \"that the plan's implementation would \nclearly make the entire Detroit public school system racially identifiable\" (id., at 54a), \"leav[ing] many \nof its schools 75 to 90 per cent Black.\" Id., at 55a. Consequently, the court reasoned, it was \nimperative to \"look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem of \nsegregation in the Detroit public schools . . .\" since \"[s]chool district lines are simply matters of \npolitical convenience and may not be used to deny constitutional rights.\" Id., at 57a. Accordingly, the \nDistrict Court proceeded to redefine the relevant area to include areas of predominantly white pupil \npopulation in order to ensure that \"upon implementation, no school, grade or classroom [would be] \nsubstantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition\" of the entire metropolitan area. \nWhile specifically acknowledging that the District Court's findings of a condition of segregation were \nlimited to Detroit, the Court of Appeals approved the use of a metropolitan remedy largely on the \ngrounds that it is \n\"impossible to declare `clearly erroneous' the District Judge's conclusion that any Detroit only \nsegregation plan will lead directly to a single segregated Detroit school district overwhelmingly black \nin all of its schools, surrounded by a ring of suburbs and suburban school districts overwhelmingly \n\nwhite in composition in a State in which the racial composition is 87 per cent white and 13 per cent \nblack.\" 484 F. 2d, at 249. \nViewing the record as a whole, it seems clear that the District Court and the Court of Appeals shifted \nthe primary 740*740 focus from a Detroit remedy to the metropolitan area only because of their \nconclusion that total desegregation of Detroit would not produce the racial balance which they \nperceived as desirable. Both courts proceeded on an assumption that the Detroit schools could not \nbe truly desegregated—in their view of what constituted desegregation—unless the racial \ncomposition of the student body of each school substantially reflected the racial composition of the \npopulation of the metropolitan area as a whole. The metropolitan area was then defined as Detroit \nplus 53 of the outlying school districts. That this was the approach the District Court expressly and \nfrankly employed is shown by the order which expressed the court's view of the constitutional \nstandard: \n\"Within the limitations of reasonable travel time and distance factors, pupil reassignments shall be \neffected within the clusters described in Exhibit P. M. 12 so as to achieve the greatest degree of \nactual desegregation to the end that, upon implementation, no school, grade or classroom [will be] \nsubstantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition.\" 345 F. Supp., at 918 (emphasis \nadded). \nIn Swann, which arose in the context of a single independent school district, the Court held: \n\"If we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a matter of substantive \nconstitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be \ndisapproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" 402 U. S., at 24. \nThe clear import of this language from Swann is that desegregation, in the sense of dismantling a \ndual school system, does not require any particular racial balance in 741*741each \"school, grade or \nclassroom.\"[19] See Spencer v. Kugler, 404 U. S. 1027 (1972). \nHere the District Court's approach to what constituted \"actual desegregation\" raises the fundamental \nquestion, not presented in Swann, as to the circumstances in which a federal court may order \ndesegregation relief that embraces more than a single school district. The court's analytical starting \npoint was its conclusion that school district lines are no more than arbitrary lines on a map drawn \"for \npolitical convenience.\" Boundary lines may be bridged where there has been a constitutional \nviolation calling for interdistrict relief, but the notion that school district lines may be casually ignored \nor treated as a mere administrative convenience is contrary to the history of public education in our \ncountry. No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the \noperation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of \ncommunity concern and support for public schools and to 742*742 quality of the educational process. \nSee Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U. S., at 469. Thus, in San Antonio School \nDistrict v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 50 (1973), we observed that local control over the educational \nprocess affords citizens an opportunity to participate in decisionmaking, permits the structuring of \nschool programs to fit local needs, and encourages \"experimentation, innovation, and a healthy \ncompetition for educational excellence.\" \nThe Michigan educational structure involved in this case, in common with most States, provides for a \nlarge measure of local control,[20] and a review of the scope and character of these local powers \nindicates the extent to which the interdistrict remedy approved by the two courts could disrupt and \nalter the structure of public education 743*743 in Michigan. The metropolitan remedy would require, \nin effect, consolidation of 54 independent school districts historically administered as separate units \ninto a vast new super school district. See n. 10, supra. Entirely apart from the logistical and other \n\nserious problems attending large-scale transportation of students, the consolidation would give rise \nto an array of other problems in financing and operating this new school system. Some of the more \nobvious questions would be: What would be the status and authority of the present popularly elected \nschool boards? Would the children of Detroit be within the jurisdiction and operating control of a \nschool board elected by the parents and residents of other districts? What board or boards would \nlevy taxes for school operations in these 54 districts constituting the consolidated metropolitan area? \nWhat provisions could be made for assuring substantial equality in tax levies among the 54 districts, \nif this were deemed requisite? What provisions would be made for financing? Would the validity of \nlong-term bonds be jeopardized unless approved by all of the component districts as well as the \nState? What body would determine that portion of the curricula now left to the discretion of local \nschool boards? Who would establish attendance zones, purchase school equipment, locate and \nconstruct new schools, and indeed attend to all the myriad day-to-day decisions that are necessary \nto school operations affecting potentially more than three-quarters of a million pupils? See n. \n10, supra. \nIt may be suggested that all of these vital operational problems are yet to be resolved by the District \nCourt, and that this is the purpose of the Court of Appeals' proposed remand. But it is obvious from \nthe scope of the interdistrict remedy itself that absent a complete restructuring of the laws of \nMichigan relating to school districts the District Court will become first, a de facto 744*744 \"legislative \nauthority\" to resolve these complex questions, and then the \"school superintendent\" for the entire \narea. This is a task which few, if any, judges are qualified to perform and one which would deprive \nthe people of control of schools through their elected representatives. \nOf course, no state law is above the Constitution. School district lines and the present laws with \nrespect to local control, are not sacrosanct and if they conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment \nfederal courts have a duty to prescribe appropriate remedies. See, e. g., Wright v. Council of the City \nof Emporia, 407 U. S. 451 (1972); United Statesv. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U. S. 484 \n(1972) (state or local officials prevented from carving out a new school district from an existing \ndistrict that was in process of dismantling a dual school system); cf. Haney v. County Board of \nEducation of Sevier County, 429 F. 2d 364 (CA8 1970) (State contributed to separation of races by \ndrawing of school district lines); United States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (ED Tex. \n1970), aff'd, 447 F. 2d 441 (CA5 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Edgar v. United States,404 U. S. 1016 \n(1972) (one or more school districts created and maintained for one race). But our prior holdings \nhave been confined to violations and remedies within a single school district. We therefore turn to \naddress, for the first time, the validity of a remedy mandating cross-district or interdistrict \nconsolidation to remedy a condition of segregation found to exist in only one district. \nThe controlling principle consistently expounded in our holdings is that the scope of the remedy is \ndetermined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation. Swann,402 U. S., at 16. Before \nthe boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the \nseparate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must 745*745 first be \nshown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant \nsegregative effect in another district. Specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of \nthe state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of \ninterdistrict segregation. Thus an interdistrict remedy might be in order where the racially \ndiscriminatory acts of one or more school districts caused racial segregation in an adjacent district, \nor where district lines have been deliberately drawn on the basis of race. In such circumstances an \ninterdistrict remedy would be appropriate to eliminate the interdistrict segregation directly caused by \nthe constitutional violation. Conversely, without an interdistrict violation and interdistrict effect, there \nis no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy. \nThe record before us, voluminous as it is, contains evidence of de jure segregated conditions only in \nthe Detroit schools; indeed, that was the theory on which the litigation was initially based and on \n\nwhich the District Court took evidence. See supra, at 725-726. With no showing of significant \nviolation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any interdistrict violation or effect, the \ncourt went beyond the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings and mandated a \nmetropolitan area remedy. To approve the remedy ordered by the court would impose on the \noutlying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a wholly impermissible \nremedy based on a standard not hinted at in Brown I and II or any holding of this Court. \nIn dissent, MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL undertake to demonstrate that \nagencies having statewide authority participated in maintaining the dual school system found to exist \nin Detroit. They are apparently of the view that once such participation is 746*746 shown, the District \nCourt should have a relatively free hand to reconstruct school districts outside of Detroit in \nfashioning relief. Our assumption, arguendo, see infra, at 748, that state agencies did participate in \nthe maintenance of the Detroit system, should make it clear that it is not on this point that we part \ncompany.[21]The difference between us arises instead from established doctrine laid down by our \ncases. Brown, supra; Green, supra; Swann, supra; Scotland Neck, supra; and Emporia, supra, each \naddressed the issue of constitutional wrong in terms of an established geographic and administrative \nschool system populated by both Negro and white children. In such a context, terms such as \n\"unitary\" and \"dual\" systems, and \"racially identifiable schools,\" have meaning, and the necessary \nfederal authority to remedy the constitutional wrong is firmly established. But the remedy is \nnecessarily designed, as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the \nposition they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct. Disparate treatment of white and \nNegro students occurred within the Detroit school system, and not elsewhere, and on this record the \nremedy must be limited to that system. Swann, supra, at 16. \nThe constitutional right of the Negro respondents residing in Detroit is to attend a unitary school \nsystem in that district. Unless petitioners drew the district lines in a discriminatory fashion, or \narranged for white students 747*747 residing in the Detroit District to attend schools in Oakland and \nMacomb Counties, they were under no constitutional duty to make provisions for Negro students to \ndo so. The view of the dissenters, that the existence of a dual system in Detroit can be made the \nbasis for a decree requiring cross-district transportation of pupils, cannot be supported on the \ngrounds that it represents merely the devising of a suitably flexible remedy for the violation of rights \nalready established by our prior decisions. It can be supported only by drastic expansion of the \nconstitutional right itself, an expansion without any support in either constitutional principle or \nprecedent.[22] \n748*748 III \nWe recognize that the six-volume record presently under consideration contains language and some \nspecific incidental findings thought by the District Court to afford a basis for interdistrict relief. \nHowever, these comparatively isolated findings and brief comments concern only one possible \ninterdistrict violation and are found in the context of a proceeding that, as the District Court \nconceded, included no proof of segregation practiced by any of the 85 suburban school districts \nsurrounding Detroit. The Court of Appeals, for example, relied on five factors which, it held, \namounted to unconstitutional state action with respect to the violations found in the Detroit system: \n(1) It held the State derivatively responsible for the Detroit Board's violations on the theory that \nactions of Detroit as a political subdivision of the State were attributable to the State. \nAccepting, arguendo, the correctness of this finding of state responsibility for the segregated \nconditions within the city of Detroit, it does not follow that an interdistrict remedy is constitutionally \njustified or required. With a single exception, discussed later, there has been no showing that either \nthe State or any of the 85 outlying districts engaged in activity that had a cross-district effect. The \nboundaries of the Detroit School District, which are coterminous with the boundaries of the city of \n\nDetroit, were established over a century ago by neutral legislation when the city was incorporated; \nthere is no evidence in the record, nor is there any suggestion by the respondents, that either the \noriginal boundaries of the Detroit School District, or any other school district in Michigan, were \nestablished for the purpose of creating, maintaining, or perpetuating segregation of races. There is \nno claim and there is no evidence hinting that petitioner outlying school districts and \ntheir 749*749 predecessors, or the 30-odd other school districts in the tricounty area—but outside the \nDistrict Court's \"desegregation area\"—have ever maintained or operated anything but unitary school \nsystems. Unitary school systems have been required for more than a century by the Michigan \nConstitution as implemented by state law.[23] Where the schools of only one district have been \naffected, there is no constitutional power in the courts to decree relief balancing the racial \ncomposition of that district's schools with those of the surrounding districts. \n(2) There was evidence introduced at trial that, during the late 1950's, Carver School District, a \npredominantly Negro suburban district, contracted to have Negro high school students sent to a \npredominantly Negro school in Detroit. At the time, Carver was an independent school district that \nhad no high school because, according to the trial evidence, \"Carver District . . . did not have a place \nfor adequate high school facilities.\" 484 F. 2d, at 231. Accordingly, arrangements were made with \nNorthern High School in the abutting Detroit School District so that the Carver high school students \ncould obtain a secondary school education. In 1960 the Oak Park School District, a predominantly \nwhite suburban district, annexed the predominantly Negro Carver School District, through the \ninitiative of local officials. 750*750 Ibid. There is, of course, no claim that the 1960 annexation had a \nsegregative purpose or result or that Oak Park now maintains a dual system. \nAccording to the Court of Appeals, the arrangement during the late 1950's which allowed Carver \nstudents to be educated within the Detroit District was dependent upon the \"tacit or express\" \napproval of the State Board of Education and was the result of the refusal of the white suburban \ndistricts to accept the Carver students. Although there is nothing in the record supporting the Court \nof Appeals' supposition that suburban white schools refused to accept the Carver students, it \nappears that this situation, whether with or without the State's consent, may have had a segregative \neffect on the school populations of the two districts involved. However, since \"the nature of the \nviolation determines the scope of the remedy,\" Swann, 402 U. S., at 16, this isolated instance \naffecting two of the school districts would not justify the broad metropolitanwide remedy \ncontemplated by the District Court and approved by the Court of Appeals, particularly since it \nembraced potentially 52 districts having no responsibility for the arrangement and involved 503,000 \npupils in addition to Detroit's 276,000 students. \n(3) The Court of Appeals cited the enactment of state legislation (Act 48) which had the effect of \nrescinding Detroit's voluntary desegregation plan (the April 7 Plan). That plan, however, affected \nonly 12 of 21 Detroit high schools and had no causal connection with the distribution of pupils by \nrace between Detroit and the other school districts within the tri-county area. \n(4) The court relied on the State's authority to supervise schoolsite selection and to approve building \nconstruction as a basis for holding the State responsible for the segregative results of the school \nconstruction program in Detroit. Specifically, the Court of Appeals asserted 751*751 that during the \nperiod between 1949 and 1962 the State Board of Education exercised general authority as \noverseer of site acquisitions by local boards for new school construction, and suggested that this \nstate-approved school construction \"fostered segregation throughout the Detroit Metropolitan area.\" \n484 F. 2d, at 241. This brief comment, however, is not supported by the evidence taken at trial since \nthat evidence was specifically limited to proof that schoolsite acquisition and school construction \nwithin the city of Detroit produced de jure segregation within the city itself. Id., at 235-238. Thus, \nthere was no evidence suggesting that the State's activities with respect to either school construction \nor site acquisition within Detroit affected the racial composition of the school population outside \n\nDetroit or, conversely, that the State's school construction and site acquisition activities within the \noutlying districts affected the racial composition of the schools within Detroit. \n(5) The Court of Appeals also relied upon the District Court's finding: \n\"This and other financial limitations, such as those on bonding and the working of the state aid \nformula whereby suburban districts were able to make far larger per pupil expenditures despite less \ntax effort, have created and perpetuated systematic educational inequalities.\" Id., at 239. \nHowever, neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court offered any indication in the record or in \ntheir opinions as to how, if at all, the availability of state-financed aid for some Michigan students \noutside Detroit, but not for those within Detroit, might have affected the racial character of any of the \nState's school districts. Furthermore, as the respondents recognize, the application of our recent \nruling in San Antonio School Districtv. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1 (1973), to this state education \nfinancing system is questionable, and this issue was not 752*752 addressed by either the Court of \nAppeals or the District Court. This, again, underscores the crucial fact that the theory upon which the \ncase proceeded related solely to the establishment of Detroit city violations as a basis for \ndesegregating Detroit schools and that, at the time of trial, neither the parties nor the trial judge was \nconcerned with a foundation for interdistrict relief.[24] \nIV \nPetitioners have urged that they were denied due process by the manner in which the District Court \nlimited their participation after intervention was allowed, thus precluding adequate opportunity to \npresent evidence that they had committed no acts having a segregative effect in Detroit. In light of \nour holding that, absent an interdistrict violation, there is no basis for an interdistrict remedy, we \nneed not reach these claims. It is clear, however, that the District Court, with the approval of the \nCourt of Appeals, has provided an interdistrict remedy in the face of a record which shows no \nconstitutional violations that would call for equitable relief except within the city of Detroit. In these \ncircumstances there was no occasion for the parties to address, or for the District Court to consider \nwhether there were racially discriminatory acts for which any of the 53 outlying districts were \nresponsible and which had direct and significant segregative effect on schools of more than one \ndistrict. \nWe conclude that the relief ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals was \nbased upon an erroneous standard and was unsupported by record evidence that acts of the \noutlying districts effected the discrimination found to exist in the schools of \nDetroit. 753*753 Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is \nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion leading to prompt formulation of a \ndecree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy which \nhas been delayed since 1970. \nReversed and remanded. \nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring. \nIn joining the opinion of the Court, I think it appropriate, in view of some of the extravagant language \nof the dissenting opinions, to state briefly my understanding of what it is that the Court decides \ntoday. \n\nThe respondents commenced this suit in 1970, claiming only that a constitutionally impermissible \nallocation of educational facilities along racial lines had occurred in public schools within a single \nschool district whose lines were coterminous with those of the city of Detroit. In the course of the \nsubsequent proceedings, the District Court found that public school officials had contributed to racial \nsegregation within that district by means of improper use of zoning and attendance patterns, \noptional-attendance areas, and building and site selection. This finding of a violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause was upheld by the Court of Appeals, and is accepted by this Court today. \nSee ante, at 738 n. 18. In the present posture of the case, therefore, the Court does not deal with \nquestions of substantive constitutional law. The basic issue now before the Court concerns, rather, \nthe appropriate exercise of federal equity jurisdiction.[1] \n754*754 No evidence was adduced and no findings were made in the District Court concerning the \nactivities of school officials in districts outside the city of Detroit, and no school officials from the \noutside districts even participated in the suit until after the District Court had made the initial \ndetermination that is the focus of today's decision. In spite of the limited scope of the inquiry and the \nfindings, the District Court concluded that the only effective remedy for the constitutional violations \nfound to have existed within the city of Detroit was a desegregation plan calling for busing pupils to \nand from school districts outside the city. The District Court found that any desegregation plan \noperating wholly \" `within the corporate geographical limits of the city' \" would be deficient since it \" \n`would clearly make the entire Detroit public school system racially identifiable as Black.' \" 484 F. 2d \n215, 244, 243. The Court of Appeals, in affirming the decision that an interdistrict remedy was \nnecessary, noted that a plan limited to the city of Detroit \"would result in an all black school system \nimmediately surrounded by practically all white suburban school systems, with an overwhelmingly \nwhite majority population in the total metropolitan area.\" Id., at 245. \nThe courts were in error for the simple reason that the remedy they thought necessary was not \ncommensurate with the constitutional violation found. Within a single school district whose officials \nhave been shown to have engaged in unconstitutional racial segregation, a remedial decree that \naffects every individual school may be dictated by \"common sense,\" see Keyes v. School District No. \n1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U. S. 189, 203, and indeed may provide the only effective means to \neliminate segregation \"root and branch,\" Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U. \nS. 430, 438, and to \"effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory \nschool 755*755 system.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301. See Keyes, supra, at \n198-205. But in this case the Court of Appeals approved the concept of a remedial decree that would \ngo beyond the boundaries of the district where the constitutional violation was found, and include \nschools and schoolchildren in many other school districts that have presumptively been administered \nin complete accord with the Constitution. \nThe opinion of the Court convincingly demonstrates, ante, at 742-743, that traditions of local control \nof schools, together with the difficulty of a judicially supervised restructuring of local administration of \nschools, render improper and inequitable such an interdistrict response to a constitutional violation \nfound to have occurred only within a single school district. \nThis is not to say, however, that an interdistrict remedy of the sort approved by the Court of Appeals \nwould not be proper, or even necessary, in other factual situations. Were it to be shown, for \nexample, that state officials had contributed to the separation of the races by drawing or redrawing \nschool district lines, see Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier County, 429 F. 2d 364; \ncf. Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451; United States v. Scotland Neck Board of \nEducation, 407 U. S. 484; by transfer of school units between districts, United States v. Texas, 321 \nF. Supp. 1043, aff'd, 447 F. 2d 441; Turner v. Warren County Board of Education, 313 F. Supp. 380; \nor by purposeful, racially discriminatory use of state housing or zoning laws, then a decree calling for \ntransfer of pupils across district lines or for restructuring of district lines might well be appropriate. \n\nIn this case, however, no such interdistrict violation was shown. Indeed, no evidence at all \nconcerning the administration of schools outside the city of Detroit was presented other than the fact \nthat these schools contained 756*756 a higher proportion of white pupils than did the schools within \nthe city. Since the mere fact of different racial compositions in contiguous districts does not itself \nimply or constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the absence of a showing that such \ndisparity was imposed, fostered, or encouraged by the State or its political subdivisions, it follows \nthat no interdistrict violation was shown in this case.[2] The formulation of an interdistrict remedy was \nthus simply not responsive to the factual record before the District Court and was an abuse of that \ncourt's equitable powers. \n757*757 In reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals this Court is in no way turning its back on \nthe proscription of state-imposed segregation first voiced in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. \n483, or on the delineation of remedial powers and duties most recently expressed \nin Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1. In Swann the Court addressed \nitself to the range of equitable remedies available to the courts to effectuate the desegregation \nmandated by Brown and its progeny, noting that the task in choosing appropriate relief is \"to correct . \n. . the condition that offends the Constitution,\" and that \"the nature of the violation determines the \nscope of the remedy . . . .\" Id., at 16. \nThe disposition of this case thus falls squarely under these principles. The only \"condition that \noffends the Constitution\" found by the District Court in this case is the existence of officially \nsupported segregation in and among public schools in Detroit itself. There were no findings that the \ndiffering racial composition between schools in the city and in the outlying suburbs was caused by \nofficial activity of any sort. It follows that the decision to include in the desegregation plan pupils from \nschool districts outside Detroit was not predicated upon any constitutional violation involving those \nschool districts. By approving a remedy that would reach beyond the limits of the city of Detroit to \ncorrect a constitutional violation found to have occurred solely within that city the Court of Appeals \nthus went beyond the governing equitable principles established in this Court's decisions. \nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting. \nThe Court of Appeals has acted responsibly in these cases and we should affirm its judgment. This \nwas the fourth time the case was before it over a span of less than three years. The Court of \nAppeals affirmed the District 758*758 Court on the issue of segregation and on the \"Detroit-only\" \nplans of desegregation. The Court of Appeals also approved in principle the use of a metropolitan \narea plan, vacating and remanding only to allow the other affected school districts to be brought in \nas parties, and in other minor respects. \nWe have before us today no plan for integration. The only orders entered so far are interlocutory. No \nnew principles of law are presented here. Metropolitan treatment of metropolitan problems is \ncommonplace. If this were a sewage problem or a water problem, or an energy problem, there can \nbe no doubt that Michigan would stay well within federal constitutional bounds if it sought a \nmetropolitan remedy. In Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 462 F. 2d 1058, aff'd by an \nequally divided Court, 412 U. S. 92, we had a case involving the Virginia school system where local \nschool boards had \"exclusive jurisdiction\" of the problem, not \"the State Board of Education,\" 462 F. \n2d, at 1067. Here the Michigan educational system is unitary, maintained and supported by the \nlegislature and under the general supervision of the State Board of Education.[1] The State controls \nthe boundaries of school districts.[2] The State supervises schoolsite selection.[3] The construction is \ndone through municipal bonds approved by several state agencies.[4] Education in Michigan is a \nstate project with very little completely local control,[5] except that the schools are financed locally, \nnot on a statewide basis. Indeed 759*759 the proposal to put school funding in Michigan on a \nstatewide basis was defeated at the polls in November 1972.[6] Yet the school districts by state law \n\nare agencies of the State.[7] State action is indeed challenged as violating the Equal Protection \nClause. Whatever the reach of that claim may be, it certainly is aimed at discrimination based on \nrace. \nTherefore as the Court of Appeals held there can be no doubt that as a matter of Michigan law the \nState itself has the final say as to where and how school district lines should be drawn.[8] \nWhen we rule against the metropolitan area remedy we take a step that will likely put the problems \nof the blacks and our society back to the period that antedated the \"separate but equal\" regime \nof Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537. The reason is simple. \nThe inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black;[9] and the blacks, we know, in many instances \nare likely to 760*760 be poorer,[10] just as were the Chicanos in San Antonio School \nDistrict v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1. By that decision the poorer school districts[11]must pay their own \nway. It is therefore a foregone conclusion that we have now given the States a formula whereby the \npoor must pay their own way.[12] \n761*761 Today's decision, given Rodriguez, means that there is no violation of the Equal Protection \nClause though the schools are segregated by race and though the black schools are not only \n\"separate\" but \"inferior.\" \nSo far as equal protection is concerned we are now in a dramatic retreat from the 7-to-1 decision in \n1896 that blacks could be segregated in public facilities, provided they received equal treatment. \nAs I indicated in Keyes v. School District No. 1 Denver, Colorado, 413 U. S. 189, 214-217, there is \nso far as the school cases go no constitutional difference between de factoand de jure segregation. \nEach school board performs state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes when it draws the \nlines that confine it to a given area, when it builds schools at particular sites, or when it allocates \nstudents. The creation of the school districts in Metropolitan Detroit either maintained existing \nsegregation or caused additional segregation. Restrictive covenants maintained by state action or \ninaction build black ghettos. It is state action when public funds are dispensed by housing agencies \nto build racial ghettos. Where a community is racially mixed and school authorities segregate \nschools, or assign black teachers to black schools or close schools in fringe areas and build new \nschools in black areas and in more distant white areas, the State creates and nurtures a segregated \nschool system, just as surely as did those States involved in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. \n483, when they maintained dual school systems. \nAll these conditions and more were found by the District Court to exist. The issue is not whether \nthere should be racial balance but whether the State's use of 762*762 various devices that end up \nwith black schools and white schools brought the Equal Protection Clause into effect. Given the \nState's control over the educational system in Michigan, the fact that the black schools are in one \ndistrict and the white schools are in another is not controlling —either constitutionally or \nequitably.[13] No specific plan has yet been adopted. We are still at an interlocutory stage of a long \ndrawn-out judicial effort at school desegregation. It is conceivable that ghettos develop on their own \nwithout any hint of state action. But since Michigan by one device or another has over the years \ncreated black school districts and white school districts, the task of equity is to provide a unitary \nsystem for the affected area where, as here, the State washes its hands of its own creations. \nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. \nJUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting. \n\nThe District Court and the Court of Appeals found that over a long period of years those in charge of \nthe Michigan public schools engaged in various practices calculated to effect the segregation of the \nDetroit school system. The Court does not question these findings, nor could it reasonably do so. \nNeither does it question the obligation of the federal courts to devise a feasible and effective remedy. \nBut it promptly cripples the ability of the judiciary to perform this task, which is of fundamental \nimportance to our constitutional system, by 763*763 fashioning a strict rule that remedies in school \ncases must stop at the school district line unless certain other conditions are met. As applied here, \nthe remedy for unquestioned violations of the equal protection rights of Detroit's Negroes by the \nDetroit School Board and the State of Michigan must be totally confined to the limits of the school \ndistrict and may not reach into adjoining or surrounding districts unless and until it is proved there \nhas been some sort of \"interdistrict violation\"— unless unconstitutional actions of the Detroit School \nBoard have had a segregative impact on other districts, or unless the segregated condition of the \nDetroit schools has itself been influenced by segregative practices in those surrounding districts into \nwhich it is proposed to extend the remedy. \nRegretfully, and for several reasons, I can join neither the Court's judgment nor its opinion. The core \nof my disagreement is that deliberate acts of segregation and their consequences will go \nunremedied, not because a remedy would be infeasible or unreasonable in terms of the usual \ncriteria governing school desegregation cases, but because an effective remedy would cause what \nthe Court considers to be undue administrative inconvenience to the State. The result is that the \nState of Michigan, the entity at which the Fourteenth Amendment is directed, has successfully \ninsulated itself from its duty to provide effective desegregation remedies by vesting sufficient power \nover its public schools in its local school districts. If this is the case in Michigan, it will be the case in \nmost States. \nThere are undoubted practical as well as legal limits to the remedial powers of federal courts in \nschool desegregation cases. The Court has made it clear that the achievement of any particular \ndegree of racial balance in the school system is not required by the Constitution; 764*764 nor may it \nbe the primary focus of a court in devising an acceptable remedy for de jure segregation. A variety of \nprocedures and techniques are available to a district court engrossed in fashioning remedies in a \ncase such as this; but the courts must keep in mind that they are dealing with the process \nof educating the young, including the very young. The task is not to devise a system of pains and \npenalties to punish constitutional violations brought to light. Rather, it is to desegregate \nan educational system in which the races have been kept apart, without, at the same time, losing \nsight of the central educational function of the schools. \nViewed in this light, remedies calling for school zoning, pairing, and pupil assignments, become \nmore and more suspect as they require that schoolchildren spend more and more time in buses \ngoing to and from school and that more and more educational dollars be diverted to transportation \nsystems. Manifestly, these considerations are of immediate and urgent concern when the issue is \nthe desegregation of a city school system where residential patterns are predominantly segregated \nand the respective areas occupied by blacks and whites are heavily populated and geographically \nextensive. Thus, if one postulates a metropolitan school system covering a sufficiently large area, \nwith the population evenly divided between whites and Negroes and with the races occupying \nidentifiable residential areas, there will be very real practical limits on the extent to which racially \nidentifiable schools can be eliminated within the school district. It is also apparent that the larger the \nproportion of Negroes in the area, the more difficult it would be to avoid having a substantial number \nof all-black or nearly all-black schools. \nThe Detroit school district is both large and heavily populated. It covers 139.6 square miles, \nencircles two 765*765 entirely separate cities and school districts, and surrounds a third city on three \nsides. Also, whites and Negroes live in identifiable areas in the city. The 1970 public school \nenrollment in the city school district totaled 289,763 and was 63.6% Negro and 34.8% white.[1] If \n\n\"racial balance\" were achieved in every school in the district, each school would be approximately \n64% Negro. A remedy confined to the district could achieve no more desegregation. Furthermore, \nthe proposed intracity remedies were beset with practical problems. None of the plans limited to the \nschool district was satisfactory to the District Court. The most promising proposal, submitted by \nrespondents, who were the plaintiffs in the District Court, would \"leave many of its schools 75 to 90 \npercent Black.\" 484 F. 2d 215, 244 (CA6 1973).[2] Transportation on a \"vast scale\" would be \nrequired; 900 buses would have to be purchased for the transportation of pupils who are not now \nbused. Id., at 243. The District Court also found that the plan \"would change a school system which \nis now Black and White to one that would be perceived as Black, thereby increasing the flight of \nWhites from the city and the system, thereby increasing the Black student population.\" Id., at 244. \nFor the District Court, \"[t]he conclusion, under the evidence in this case, is inescapable that relief of \nsegregation in the public schools of the 766*766 City of Detroit cannot be accomplished within the \ncorporate geographical limits of the city.\" Ibid. \nThe District Court therefore considered extending its remedy to the suburbs. After hearings, it \nconcluded that a much more effective desegregation plan could be implemented if the suburban \ndistricts were included. In proceeding to design its plan on the basis that student bus rides to and \nfrom school should not exceed 40 minutes each way as a general matter, the court's express finding \nwas that \"[f]or all the reasons stated heretofore— including time, distance, and transportation \nfactors— desegregation within the area described is physically easier and more practicable and \nfeasible, than desegregation efforts limited to the corporate geographic limits of the city of Detroit.\" \n345 F. Supp. 914, 930 (ED Mich. 1972). \nThe Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the remedy must extend beyond the city \nlimits of Detroit. It concluded that \"[i]n the instant case the only feasible desegregation plan involves \nthe crossing of the boundary lines between the Detroit School District and adjacent or nearby school \ndistricts for the limited purpose of providing an effective desegregation plan.\" 484 F. 2d, at 249. \n(Emphasis added.) It also agreed that \"any Detroit only desegregation plan will lead directly to a \nsingle segregated Detroit school district overwhelmingly black in all of its schools, surrounded by a \nring of suburbs and suburban school districts overwhelmingly white in composition in a State in \nwhich the racial composition is 87 percent white and 13 percent black.\" Ibid. There was \"more than \nample support for the District Judge's findings of unconstitutional segregation by race resulting in \nmajor part from action and inaction of public authorities, both local and State. . . . Under this record a \nremedial order of a court of equity which left the Detroit school system overwhelmingly black (for the \nforeseeable 767*767 future) surrounded by suburban school systems overwhelmingly white cannot \ncorrect the constitutional violations herein found.\" Id., at 250. To conclude otherwise, the Court of \nAppeals announced, would call up \"haunting memories of the now long overruled and discredited \n`separate but equal doctrine' of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 . . . (1896),\" and \"would be \nopening a way to nullify Brown v. Board of Education which overruled Plessy . . . .\" 484 F. 2d, at 249. \nThis Court now reverses the Court of Appeals. It does not question the District Court's findings \nthat any feasible Detroit-only plan would leave many schools 75 to 90 percent black and that the \ndistrict would become progressively more black as whites left the city. Neither does the Court \nsuggest that including the suburbs in a desegregation plan would be impractical or infeasible \nbecause of educational considerations, because of the number of children requiring transportation, \nor because of the length of their rides. Indeed, the Court leaves unchallenged the District Court's \nconclusion that a plan including the suburbs would be physically easier and more practical and \nfeasible than a Detroit-only plan. Whereas the most promising Detroit-only plan, for example, would \nhave entailed the purchase of 900 buses, the metropolitan plan would involve the acquisition of no \nmore than 350 new vehicles. \nDespite the fact that a metropolitan remedy, if the findings of the District Court accepted by the Court \nof Appeals are to be credited, would more effectively desegregate the Detroit schools, would prevent \n\nresegregation,[3] and would be easier and more feasible from many 768*768 standpoints, the Court \nfashions out of whole cloth an arbitrary rule that remedies for constitutional violations occurring in a \nsingle Michigan school district must stop at the school district line. Apparently, no matter how much \nless burdensome or more effective and efficient in many respects, such as transportation, the \nmetropolitan plan might be, the school district line may not be crossed. Otherwise, it seems, there \nwould be too much disruption of the Michigan scheme for managing its educational system, too \nmuch confusion, and too much administrative burden. \nThe District Court, on the scene and familiar with local conditions, had a wholly different view. The \nCourt of Appeals also addressed itself at length to matters of local law and to the problems that \ninterdistrict remedies might present to the State of Michigan. Its conclusion, flatly contrary to that of \nthis Court, was that \"the constitutional right to equality before the law [is not] hemmed in by the \nboundaries of a school district\" and that an interdistrict remedy \n\"is supported by the status of school districts under Michigan law and by the historical control \nexercised over local school districts by the legislature of Michigan and by State agencies and \nofficials . . . . [I]t is well established under the Constitution and laws of Michigan that the public \nschool system is a State function and that local school districts are instrumentalities of the State \ncreated for administrative convenience.\"[4] 484 F. 2d, at 245-246. \n769*769 I am surprised that the Court, sitting at this distance from the State of Michigan, claims \nbetter insight than the Court of Appeals and the District Court as to whether an interdistrict remedy \nfor equal protection violations practiced by the State of Michigan would involve undue difficulties for \nthe State in the management of its public schools. In the area of what constitutes an acceptable \ndesegregation plan, \"we must of necessity rely to a large extent, as this Court has for more than 16 \nyears, on the informed judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of \nappeals.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, 28 (1971). Obviously, \nwhatever difficulties there might be, they are surmountable; for the Court itself concedes that, had \nthere been sufficient evidence of an interdistrict violation, the District Court could have fashioned a \nsingle remedy for the districts implicated rather than a different remedy for each district 770*770 in \nwhich the violation had occurred or had an impact. \nI am even more mystified as to how the Court can ignore the legal reality that the constitutional \nviolations, even if occurring locally, were committed by governmental entities for which the State is \nresponsible and that it is the State that must respond to the command of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. An interdistrict remedy for the infringements that occurred in this case is well within the \nconfines and powers of the State, which is the governmental entity ultimately responsible for \ndesegregating its schools. The Michigan Supreme Court has observed that \"[t]he school district is a \nState agency,\" Attorney General ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, 131 Mich. 639, 644, 92 N. W. 289, 290 \n(1902), and that \" `[e]ducation in Michigan belongs to the State. It is no part of the local self-\ngovernment inherent in the township or municipality, except so far as the legislature may choose to \nmake it such. The Constitution has turned the whole subject over to the legislature. . . .' \" Attorney \nGeneral ex rel. Zacharias v. Detroit Board of Education, 154 Mich. 584, 590, 118 N. W. 606, 609 \n(1908). \nIt is unnecessary to catalogue at length the various public misdeeds found by the District Court and \nthe Court of Appeals to have contributed to the present segregation of the Detroit public schools. \nThe legislature contributed directly by enacting a statute overriding a partial high school \ndesegregation plan voluntarily adopted by the Detroit Board of Education. Indirectly, the trial court \nfound the State was accountable for the thinly disguised, pervasive acts of segregation committed by \nthe Detroit Board,[5] for Detroit's school construction 771*771 plans that would promote segregation, \nand for the Detroit school district's not having funds for pupil transportation within the district. The \n\nState was also chargeable with responsibility for the transportation of Negro high school students in \nthe late 1950's from the suburban Ferndale School District, past closer suburban and Detroit high \nschools with predominantly white student bodies, to a predominantly Negro high school within \nDetroit. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, at 20-21, and Keyes v. School \nDistrict No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U. S. 189 (1973), make abundantly clear that the tactics \nemployed by the Detroit Board of Education, a local instrumentality of the State, violated the \nconstitutional rights of the Negro students in Detroit's public schools and required equitable relief \nsufficient to accomplish the maximum, practical desegregation within the power of the political body \nagainst which the Fourteenth Amendment directs its proscriptions. No \"State\" may deny any \nindividual the equal protection of the laws; and if the Constitution and the Supremacy Clause are to \nhave any substance at all, the courts must be free to devise workable remedies against the political \nentity with the effective power to determine local choice. It is also the case here that the State's \nlegislative interdiction of Detroit's voluntary effort to desegregate its school system was \nunconstitutional. See North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43 (1971). \nThe Court draws the remedial line at the Detroit school district boundary, even though the \nFourteenth Amendment is addressed to the State and even though 772*772 the Statedenies equal \nprotection of the laws when its public agencies, acting in its behalf, invidiously discriminate. The \nState's default is \"the condition that offends the Constitution,\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, supra, at 16, and state officials may therefore be ordered to take the necessary \nmeasures to completely eliminate from the Detroit public schools \"all vestiges of state-imposed \nsegregation.\" Id.,at 15. I cannot understand, nor does the majority satisfactorily explain, why a \nfederal court may not order an appropriate interdistrict remedy, if this is necessary or more effective \nto accomplish this constitutionally mandated task. As the Court unanimously observed \nin Swann: \"Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable \npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.\" Ibid. In this case, both the right and the State's Fourteenth Amendment violation have \nconcededly been fully established, and there is no acceptable reason for permitting the party \nresponsible for the constitutional violation to contain the remedial powers of the federal court within \nadministrative boundaries over which the transgressor itself has plenary power. \nThe unwavering decisions of this Court over the past 20 years support the assumption of the Court \nof Appeals that the District Court's remedial power does not cease at the school district line. The \nCourt's first formulation of the remedial principles to be followed in disestablishing racially \ndiscriminatory school systems recognized the variety of problems arising from different local school \nconditions and the necessity for that \"practical flexibility\" traditionally associated with courts of \nequity. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 299-301 (1955) (Brown II). Indeed, the district \ncourts to which 773*773 the Brown cases were remanded for the formulation of remedial decrees \nwere specifically instructed that they might consider, inter alia, \"revision of school districts and \nattendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public \nschools on a nonracial basis . . . .\" Id., at 300-301. The malady addressed in Brown II was the \nstatewide policy of requiring or permitting school segregation on the basis of race, while the record \nhere concerns segregated schools only in the city of Detroit. The obligation to rectify the unlawful \ncondition nevertheless rests on the State. The permissible revision of school districts contemplated \nin Brown II rested on the State's responsibility for desegregating its unlawfully segregated schools, \nnot on any segregative effect which the condition of segregation in one school district might have \nhad on the schools of a neighboring district. The same situation obtains here and the same remedial \npower is available to the District Court. \nLater cases reinforced the clearly essential rules that state officials are fully answerable for \nunlawfully caused conditions of school segregation which can effectively be controlled only by steps \nbeyond the authority of local school districts to take, and that the equity power of the district courts \nincludes the ability to order such measures implemented. When the highest officials of the State of \n\nArkansas impeded a federal court order to desegregate the public schools under the immediate \njurisdiction of the Little Rock School Board, this Court refused to accept the local board's assertion of \nits good faith as a legal excuse for delay in implementing the desegregation order. The Court \nemphasized that \"from the point of view of the Fourteenth Amendment, they [the local school board \nmembers] stand in this litigation as the agents of the State.\" Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 16 (1958). \nPerhaps 774*774 more importantly for present purposes, the Court went on to state: \n\"The record before us clearly establishes that the growth of the Board's difficulties to a magnitude \nbeyond its unaided power to control is the product of state action. Those difficulties . . . can also be \nbrought under control by state action.\" Ibid. \nSee also Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218, 228, 233-234 (1964). \nIn the context of dual school systems, the Court subsequently made clear the \"affirmative duty to \ntake whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination \nwould be eliminated root and branch\" and to come forward with a desegregation plan that \"promises \nrealistically to work now.\" Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, 437-\n438, 439 (1968). \"Freedom of choice\" plans were rejected as acceptable desegregation measures \nwhere \"reasonably available other ways . . . promising speedier and more effective conversion to a \nunitary, nonracial school system . . .\" exist. Id., at 441. Imperative insistence on immediate full \ndesegregation of dual school systems \"to operate now and hereafter only unitary schools\" was \nreiterated in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U. S. 19, 20 \n(1969), and Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U. S. 290 (1970). \nThe breadth of the equitable authority of the district courts to accomplish these comprehensive tasks \nwas reaffirmed in much greater detail in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, \nsupra, and the companion case of Davis v. School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U. S. 33 \n(1971), where there was unanimous assent to the following propositions: \n\"Having once found a violation, the district judge or school authorities should make every effort \nto 775*775 achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the \npracticalities of the situation. A district court may and should consider the use of all available \ntechniques including restructuring of attendance zones and both contiguous and noncontiguous \nattendance zones. . . . The measure of any desegregation plan is its effectiveness.\" Id., at 37. \nNo suggestion was made that interdistrict relief was not an available technique. \nIn Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education itself, the Court, without dissent, recognized \nthat the District Judge, in fulfilling his obligation to \"make every effort to achieve the greatest possible \ndegree of actual desegregation[,] will thus necessarily be concerned with the elimination of one-race \nschools.\" 402 U. S., at 26. Nor was there any dispute that to break up the dual school system, it was \nwithin the District Court's \"broad remedial powers\" to employ a \"frank—and sometimes drastic—\ngerrymandering of school districts and attendance zones,\" as well as \"pairing, `clustering,' or \n`grouping' of schools,\" to desegregate the \"formerly all-Negro schools,\" despite the fact that these \nzones might not be compact or contiguous and might be \"on opposite ends of the city.\" Id., at 27. \nThe school board in that case had jurisdiction over a 550-square-mile area encompassing the city of \nCharlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The Mobile County, Alabama, \nboard in Davis embraced a 1,248-square-mile area, including the city of Mobile. Yet the Court \napproved the District Court's authority to award countywide relief in each case in order to accomplish \ndesegregation of the dual school system. \nEven more recently, the Court specifically rejected the claim that a new school district, which \nadmittedly would operate a unitary school system within its borders, was beyond the reach of a \n\ncourt-ordered desegregation plan 776*776 for other school districts, where the effectiveness of the \nplan as to the other districts depended upon the availability of the facilities and student population of \nthe new district. In Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451, 470 (1972), we held \"that \na new school district may not be created where its effect would be to impede the process of \ndismantling a dual system.\" MR. JUSTICE STEWART's opinion for the Court made clear that if a \nproposal to erect new district boundary lines \"would impede the dismantling of the [pre-existing] dual \nsystem, then a district court, in the exercise of its remedial discretion, may enjoin it from being \ncarried out.\" Id., at 460. In United States v. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U. S. 484 \n(1972), this same standard was applied to forbid North Carolina from creating a new city school \ndistrict within a larger district which was in the process of dismantling a dual school system. The \nCourt noted that if establishment of the new district were permitted, the \"traditional racial identities of \nthe schools in the area would be maintained,\" id., at 490. \nUntil today, the permissible contours of the equitable authority of the district courts to remedy the \nunlawful establishment of a dual school system have been extensive, adaptable, and fully \nresponsive to the ultimate goal of achieving \"the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation.\" \nThere are indeed limitations on the equity powers of the federal judiciary, but until now the Court has \nnot accepted the proposition that effective enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment could be \nlimited by political or administrative boundary lines demarcated by the very State responsible for the \nconstitutional violation and for the disestablishment of the dual system. Until now the Court has \ninstead looked to practical considerations in effectuating a desegregation 777*777decree such as \nexcessive distance, transportation time, and hazards to the safety of the schoolchildren involved in a \nproposed plan. That these broad principles have developed in the context of dual school systems \ncompelled or authorized by state statute at the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 \n(1954) (Brown I), does not lessen their current applicability to dual systems found to exist in other \ncontexts, like that in Detroit, where intentional school segregation does not stem from the \ncompulsion of state law, but from deliberate individual actions of local and state school authorities \ndirected at a particular school system. The majority properly does not suggest that the duty to \neradicate completely the resulting dual system in the latter context is any less than in the former. But \nits reason for incapacitating the remedial authority of the federal judiciary in the presence of school \ndistrict perimeters in the latter context is not readily apparent. \nThe result reached by the Court certainly cannot be supported by the theory that the configuration of \nlocal governmental units is immune from alteration when necessary to redress constitutional \nviolations. In addition to the well-established principles already noted, the Court has elsewhere \nrequired the public bodies of a State to restructure the State's political subdivisions to remedy \ninfringements of the constitutional rights of certain members of its populace, notably in the \nreapportionment cases. In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), for example, which held that \nequal protection of the laws demands that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature \nbe apportioned on a population basis, thus necessitating wholesale revision of Alabama's voting \ndistricts, the Court remarked: \n\"Political subdivisions of States—counties, cities, or whatever—never were and never have been \nconsidered 778*778 as sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as \nsubordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state \ngovernmental functions.\" Id., at 575. \nAnd even more pointedly, the Court declared in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 344-345 \n(1960), that \"[l]egislative control of municipalities, no less than other state power, lies within the \nscope of relevant limitations imposed by the United States Constitution.\" \n\nNor does the Court's conclusion follow from the talismanic invocation of the desirability of local \ncontrol over education. Local autonomy over school affairs, in the sense of the community's \nparticipation in the decisions affecting the education of its children, is, of course, an important \ninterest. But presently constituted school district lines do not delimit fixed and unchangeable areas of \na local educational community. If restructuring is required to meet constitutional requirements, local \nauthority may simply be redefined in terms of whatever configuration is adopted, with the parents of \nthe children attending schools in the newly demarcated district or attendance zone continuing their \nparticipation in the policy management of the schools with which they are concerned most directly. \nThe majority's suggestion that judges should not attempt to grapple with the administrative problems \nattendant on a reorganization of school attendance patterns is wholly without foundation. It is \nprecisely this sort of task which the district courts have been properly exercising to vindicate the \nconstitutional rights of Negro students since Brown I and which the Court has never suggested they \nlack the capacity to perform. Intradistrict revisions of attendance zones, and pairing and grouping of \nschools, are techniques unanimously approved in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg 779*779 Board \nof Education which entail the same sensitivity to the interest of parents in the education their children \nreceive as would an interdistrict plan which is likely to employ the very same methods. There is no \nreason to suppose that the District Court, which has not yet adopted a final plan of desegregation, \nwould not be as capable of giving or as likely to give sufficient weight to the interest in community \nparticipation in schools in an interdistrict setting, consistent with the dictates of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. The majority's assumption that the District Court would act otherwise is a radical \ndeparture from the practical flexibility previously left to the equity powers of the federal judiciary. \nFinally, I remain wholly unpersuaded by the Court's assertion that \"the remedy is necessarily \ndesigned, as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they \nwould have occupied in the absence of such conduct.\" Ante,at 746. In the first place, under this \npremise the Court's judgment is itself infirm; for had the Detroit school system not followed an official \npolicy of segregation throughout the 1950's and 1960's, Negroes and whites would have been going \nto school together. There would have been no, or at least not as many, recognizable Negro schools \nand no, or at least not as many, white schools, but \"just schools,\" and neither Negroes nor whites \nwould have suffered from the effects of segregated education, with all its shortcomings. Surely the \nCourt's remedy will not restore to the Negro community, stigmatized as it was by the dual school \nsystem, what it would have enjoyed over all or most of this period if the remedy is confined to \npresent-day Detroit; for the maximum remedy available within that area will leave many of the \nschools almost totally black, and the system itself will be predominantly black and will become \nincreasingly so. Moreover, when a State has engaged in acts of official segregation over a \nlengthy 780*780 period of time, as in the case before us, it is unrealistic to suppose that the children \nwho were victims of the State's unconstitutional conduct could now be provided the benefits of which \nthey were wrongfully deprived. Nor can the benefits which accrue to school systems in which \nschoolchildren have not been officially segregated, and to the communities supporting such school \nsystems, be fully and immediately restored after a substantial period of unlawful segregation. The \neducation of children of different races in a desegregated environment has unhappily been lost, \nalong with the social, economic, and political advantages which accompany a desegregated school \nsystem as compared with an unconstitutionally segregated system. It is for these reasons that the \nCourt has consistently followed the course of requiring the effects of past official segregation to be \neliminated \"root and branch\" by imposing, in the present, the duty to provide a remedy which will \nachieve \"the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities \nof the situation.\" It is also for these reasons that once a constitutional violation has been found, the \ndistrict judge obligated to provide such a remedy \"will thus necessarily be concerned with the \nelimination of one-race schools.\" These concerns were properly taken into account by the District \nJudge in this case. Confining the remedy to the boundaries of the Detroit district is quite unrelated \neither to the goal of achieving maximum desegregation or to those intensely practical considerations, \nsuch as the extent and expense of transportation, that have imposed limits on remedies in cases \n\nsuch as this. The Court's remedy, in the end, is essentially arbitrary and will leave serious violations \nof the Constitution substantially unremedied. \nI agree with my Brother DOUGLAS that the Court of Appeals has acted responsibly in these cases. \nRegrettably, 781*781 the majority's arbitrary limitation on the equitable power of federal district \ncourts, based on the invisible borders of local school districts, is unrelated to the State's \nresponsibility for remedying the constitutional wrongs visited upon the Negro schoolchildren of \nDetroit. It is oblivious to the potential benefits of metropolitan relief, to the noneducational \ncommunities of interest among neighborhoods located in and sometimes bridging different school \ndistricts, and to the considerable interdistrict cooperation already existing in various educational \nareas. Ultimately, it is unresponsive to the goal of attaining the utmost actual desegregation \nconsistent with restraints of practicability and thus augurs the frequent frustration of the remedial \npowers of the federal courts. \nHere the District Court will be forced to impose an intracity desegregation plan more expensive to \nthe district, more burdensome for many of Detroit's Negro students, and surely more conducive to \nwhite flight than a metropolitan plan would be—all of this merely to avoid what the Detroit School \nBoard, the District Court, and the en banc Court of Appeals considered to be the very manageable \nand quite surmountable difficulties that would be involved in extending the desegregation remedy to \nthe suburban school districts. \nI am therefore constrained to record my disagreement and dissent. \nMR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and \nMR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting. \nIn Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), this Court held that segregation of children in \npublic schools on the basis of race deprives minority group children of equal educational \nopportunities and therefore denies them the equal protection of the laws under \nthe 782*782 Fourteenth Amendment. This Court recognized then that remedying decades of \nsegregation in public education would not be an easy task. Subsequent events, unfortunately, have \nseen that prediction bear bitter fruit. But however imbedded old ways, however ingrained old \nprejudices, this Court has not been diverted from its appointed task of making \"a living truth\" of our \nconstitutional ideal of equal justice under law. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 20 (1958). \nAfter 20 years of small, often difficult steps toward that great end, the Court today takes a giant step \nbackwards. Notwithstanding a record showing widespread and pervasive racial segregation in the \neducational system provided by the State of Michigan for children in Detroit, this Court holds that the \nDistrict Court was powerless to require the State to remedy its constitutional violation in any \nmeaningful fashion. Ironically purporting to base its result on the principle that the scope of the \nremedy in a desegregation case should be determined by the nature and the extent of the \nconstitutional violation, the Court's answer is to provide no remedy at all for the violation proved in \nthis case, thereby guaranteeing that Negro children in Detroit will receive the same separate and \ninherently unequal education in the future as they have been unconstitutionally afforded in the past. \nI cannot subscribe to this emasculation of our constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws \nand must respectfully dissent. Our precedents, in my view, firmly establish that where, as here, \nstate-imposed segregation has been demonstrated, it becomes the duty of the State to eliminate \nroot and branch all vestiges of racial discrimination and to achieve the greatest possible degree of \nactual desegregation. I agree with both the District Court and the Court of Appeals that, under the \nfacts of this case, this duty cannot be fulfilled unless the State 783*783 of Michigan involves outlying \nmetropolitan area school districts in its desegregation remedy. Furthermore, I perceive no basis \n\neither in law or in the practicalities of the situation justifying the State's interposition of school district \nboundaries as absolute barriers to the implementation of an effective desegregation remedy. Under \nestablished and frequently used Michigan procedures, school district lines are both flexible and \npermeable for a wide variety of purposes, and there is no reason why they must now stand in the \nway of meaningful desegregation relief. \nThe rights at issue in this case are too fundamental to be abridged on grounds as superficial as \nthose relied on by the majority today. We deal here with the right of all of our children, whatever their \nrace, to an equal start in life and to an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as citizens. \nThose children who have been denied that right in the past deserve better than to see fences thrown \nup to deny them that right in the future. Our Nation, I fear, will be ill served by the Court's refusal to \nremedy separate and unequal education, for unless our children begin to learn together, there is little \nhope that our people will ever learn to live together. \nI \nThe great irony of the Court's opinion and, in my view, its most serious analytical flaw may be \ngleaned from its concluding sentence, in which the Court remands for \"prompt formulation of a \ndecree directed to eliminating the segregation found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy which \nhas been delayed since 1970.\" Ante, at 753. The majority, however, seems to have forgotten the \nDistrict Court's explicit finding that a Detroit-only decree, the only remedy permitted under today's \ndecision, \"would not accomplish desegregation.\" \n784*784 Nowhere in the Court's opinion does the majority confront, let alone respond to, the District \nCourt's conclusion that a remedy limited to the city of Detroit would not effectively desegregate the \nDetroit city schools. I, for one, find the District Court's conclusion well supported by the record and its \nanalysis compelled by our prior cases. Before turning to these questions, however, it is best to begin \nby laying to rest some mischaracterizations in the Court's opinion with respect to the basis for the \nDistrict Court's decision to impose a metropolitan remedy. \nThe Court maintains that while the initial focus of this lawsuit was the condition of segregation within \nthe Detroit city schools, the District Court abruptly shifted focus in mid-course and altered its theory \nof the case. This new theory, in the majority's words, was \"equating racial imbalance with a \nconstitutional violation calling for a remedy.\" Ante,at 741 n. 19. As the following review of the District \nCourt's handling of the case demonstrates, however, the majority's characterization is totally \ninaccurate. Nowhere did the District Court indicate that racial imbalance between school districts in \nthe Detroit metropolitan area or within the Detroit School District constituted a constitutional violation \ncalling for interdistrict relief. The focus of this case was from the beginning, and has remained, the \nsegregated system of education in the Detroit city schools and the steps necessary to cure that \ncondition which offends the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe District Court's consideration of this case began with its finding, which the majority accepts, that \nthe State of Michigan, through its instrumentality, the Detroit Board of Education, engaged in \nwidespread purposeful acts of racial segregation in the Detroit School District. Without belaboring \nthe details, it is sufficient to 785*785 note that the various techniques used in Detroit were typical of \nmethods employed to segregate students by race in areas where no statutory dual system of \neducation has existed. See, e. g., Keyesv. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U. S. 189 \n(1973). Exacerbating the effects of extensive residential segregation between Negroes and whites, \nthe school board consciously drew attendance zones along lines which maximized the segregation \nof the races in schools as well. Optional attendance zones were created for neighborhoods \nundergoing racial transition so as to allow whites in these areas to escape integration. Negro \n\nstudents in areas with overcrowded schools were transported past or away from closer white \nschools with available space to more distant Negro schools. Grade structures and feeder-school \npatterns were created and maintained in a manner which had the foreseeable and actual effect of \nkeeping Negro and white pupils in separate schools. Schools were also constructed in locations and \nin sizes which ensured that they would open with predominantly one-race student bodies. In sum, \nthe evidence adduced below showed that Negro children had been intentionally confined to an \nexpanding core of virtually all-Negro schools immediately surrounded by a receding band of all-white \nschools. \nContrary to the suggestions in the Court's opinion, the basis for affording a desegregation remedy in \nthis case was not some perceived racial imbalance either between schools within a single school \ndistrict or between independent school districts. What we confront here is \"a systematic program of \nsegregation affecting a substantial portion of the students, schools . . . and facilities within the school \nsystem . . . .\" Id., at 201. The constitutional violation found here was not some de facto racial \nimbalance, but rather the purposeful, intentional, massive, de jure segregation of the Detroit city \nschools, 786*786 which under our decision in Keyes, forms \"a predicate for a finding of the existence \nof a dual school system,\" ibid., and justifies \"all-out desegregation.\" Id., at 214. \nHaving found a de jure segregated public school system in operation in the city of Detroit, the District \nCourt turned next to consider which officials and agencies should be assigned the affirmative \nobligation to cure the constitutional violation. The court concluded that responsibility for the \nsegregation in the Detroit city schools rested not only with the Detroit Board of Education, but \nbelonged to the State of Michigan itself and the state defendants in this case—that is, the Governor \nof Michigan, the Attorney General, the State Board of Education, and the State Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction. While the validity of this conclusion will merit more extensive analysis below, \nsuffice it for now to say that it was based on three considerations. First, the evidence at trial showed \nthat the State itself had taken actions contributing to the segregation within the Detroit schools. \nSecond, since the Detroit Board of Education was an agency of the State of Michigan, its acts of \nracial discrimination were acts of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the \nDistrict Court found that under Michigan law and practice, the system of education was in fact \na state school system, characterized by relatively little local control and a large degree of centralized \nstate regulation, with respect to both educational policy and the structure and operation of school \ndistricts. \nHaving concluded, then, that the school system in the city of Detroit was a de juresegregated system \nand that the State of Michigan had the affirmative duty to remedy that condition of segregation, the \nDistrict Court then turned to the difficult task of devising an effective remedy. It bears repeating that \nthe District Court's focus at this stage of the litigation remained what it had 787*787 been at the \nbeginning—the condition of segregation within the Detroit city schools. As the District Court stated: \n\"From the initial ruling [on segregation] to this day, the basis of the proceedings has been and \nremains the violation: de jure school segregation. . . . The task before this court, therefore, is now, \nand . . . has always been, how to desegregate the Detroit public schools.\" \nThe District Court first considered three desegregation plans limited to the geographical boundaries \nof the city of Detroit. All were rejected as ineffective to desegregate the Detroit city schools. \nSpecifically, the District Court determined that the racial composition of the Detroit student body is \nsuch that implementation of any Detroit-only plan \"would clearly make the entire Detroit public school \nsystem racially identifiable as Black\" and would \"leave many of its schools 75 to 90 per cent Black.\" \nThe District Court also found that a Detroit-only plan \"would change a school system which is now \nBlack and White to one that would be perceived as Black, thereby increasing the flight of Whites \nfrom the city and the system, thereby increasing the Black student population.\" Based on these \nfindings, the District Court reasoned that \"relief of segregation in the public schools of the City of \nDetroit cannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city\" because a \n\nDetroit-only decree \"would accentuate the racial identifiability of the district as a Black school \nsystem, and would not accomplish desegregation.\" The District Court therefore concluded that it \n\"must look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem of segregation \nin the Detroit public schools . . . .\" \nIn seeking to define the appropriate scope of that expanded desegregation area, however, the \nDistrict Court continued to maintain as its sole focus the condition shown to violate the Constitution \nin this case—the segregation of the Detroit school system. As it stated, the 788*788 primary question \n\"remains the determination of the area necessary and practicable effectively to eliminate `root and \nbranch' the effects of state-imposed and supported segregation and to desegregate the Detroit \npublic schools.\" \nThere is simply no foundation in the record, then, for the majority's accusation that the only basis for \nthe District Court's order was some desire to achieve a racial balance in the Detroit metropolitan \narea.[1] In fact, just the contrary is the case. In considering proposed desegregation areas, the \nDistrict Court had occasion to criticize one of the State's proposals specifically because it had no \nbasis other than its \"particular racial ratio\" and did not focus on \"relevant factors, like eliminating \nracially identifiable schools [and] accomplishing maximum actual desegregation of the Detroit public \nschools.\" Similarly, in rejecting the Detroit School Board's proposed desegregation area, even \nthough it included more all-white districts and therefore achieved a higher white-Negro ratio, the \nDistrict Court commented: \n\"There is nothing in the record which suggests that these districts need be included in the \ndesegregation area in order to disestablish the racial 789*789identifiability of the Detroit public \nschools. From the evidence, the primary reason for the Detroit School Board's interest in the \ninclusion of these school districts is not racial desegregation but to increase the average socio-\neconomic balance of all the schools in the abutting regions and clusters.\" \nThe Court also misstates the basis for the District Court's order by suggesting that since the only \nsegregation proved at trial was within the Detroit school system, any relief which extended beyond \nthe jurisdiction of the Detroit Board of Education would be inappropriate because it would impose a \nremedy on outlying districts \"not shown to have committed any constitutional violation.\" Ante, at \n745.[2] The essential foundation of interdistrict relief in this case was not to correct conditions within \noutlying districts which themselves engaged in purposeful segregation. Instead, interdistrict relief \nwas seen as a necessary part of any meaningful effort by the State of Michigan to remedy the state-\ncaused segregation within the city of Detroit. \nRather than consider the propriety of interdistrict relief on this basis, however, the Court has \nconjured up a largely fictional account of what the District Court was attempting to accomplish. With \nall due respect, the Court, in my view, does a great disservice to the District Judge who labored long \nand hard with this complex litigation by accusing him of changing horses in midstream and shifting \nthe focus of this case from the pursuit of a remedy for the condition of segregation 790*790 within the \nDetroit school system to some unprincipled attempt to impose his own philosophy of racial balance \non the entire Detroit metropolitan area. See ante, at 738-739. The focus of this case has always \nbeen the segregated system of education in the city of Detroit. The District Court determined that \ninterdistrict relief was necessary and appropriate only because it found that the condition of \nsegregation within the Detroit school system could not be cured with a Detroit-only remedy. It is on \nthis theory that the interdistrict relief must stand or fall. Unlike the Court, I perceive my task to be to \nreview the District Court's order for what it is, rather than to criticize it for what it manifestly is not. \nII \n\nAs the foregoing demonstrates, the District Court's decision to expand its desegregation decree \nbeyond the geographical limits of the city of Detroit rested in large part on its conclusions (A) that the \nState of Michigan was ultimately responsible for curing the condition of segregation within the Detroit \ncity schools, and (B) that a Detroit-only remedy would not accomplish this task. In my view, both of \nthese conclusions are well supported by the facts of this case and by this Court's precedents. \nA \nTo begin with, the record amply supports the District Court's findings that the State of Michigan, \nthrough state officers and state agencies, had engaged in purposeful acts which created or \naggravated segregation in the Detroit schools. The State Board of Education, for example, prior to \n1962, exercised its authority to supervise local schoolsite selection in a manner which contributed to \nsegregation. 484 F. 2d 215, 238 (CA6 1973). Furthermore, the State's continuing authority, after \n1962, 791*791 to approve school building construction plans[3] had intertwined the State with site-\nselection decisions of the Detroit Board of Education which had the purpose and effect of \nmaintaining segregation. \nThe State had also stood in the way of past efforts to desegregate the Detroit city schools. In 1970, \nfor example, the Detroit School Board had begun implementation of its own desegregation plan for \nits high schools, despite considerable public and official resistance. The State Legislature intervened \nby enacting Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970, specifically prohibiting implementation of the \ndesegregation plan and thereby continuing the growing segregation of the Detroit school system. \nAdequate desegregation of the Detroit system was also hampered by discriminatory restrictions \nplaced by the State on the use of transportation within Detroit. While state aid for transportation was \nprovided by statute for suburban districts, many of which were highly urbanized, aid for intracity \ntransportation was excepted. One of the effects of this restriction was to encourage the construction \nof small walk-in neighborhood schools in Detroit, thereby lending aid to the intentional policy of \ncreating a school system which reflected, to the greatest extent feasible, extensive residential \nsegregation. Indeed, that one of the purposes of the transportation restriction was to impede \ndesegregation was evidenced when the Michigan Legislature amended the State Transportation Aid \nAct to cover intracity transportation but expressly prohibited the allocation of funds for cross-busing \nof students within a school district to achieve racial balance.[4] Cf. North Carolina State Board of \nEducation v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43 (1971). \n792*792 Also significant was the State's involvement during the 1950's in the transportation of Negro \nhigh school students from the Carver School District past a closer white high school in the Oak Park \nDistrict to a more distant Negro high school in the Detroit system. Certainly the District Court's \nfinding that the State Board of Education had knowledge of this action and had given its tacit or \nexpress approval was not clearly erroneous. Given the comprehensive statutory powers of the State \nBoard of Education over contractual arrangements between school districts in the enrollment of \nstudents on a nonresident tuition basis, including certification of the number of pupils involved in the \ntransfer and the amount of tuition charged, over the review of transportation routes and distances, \nand over the disbursement of transportation funds,[5] the State Board inevitably knew and \nunderstood the significance of this discriminatory act. \nAside from the acts of purposeful segregation committed by the State Legislature and the State \nBoard of Education, the District Court also concluded that the State was responsible for the many \nintentional acts of segregation committed by the Detroit Board of Education, an agency of the State. \nThe majority is only willing to accept this finding arguendo. See ante, at 748. I have no doubt, \nhowever, as to its validity under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n\"The command of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" it should be recalled, \"is that no `State' shall deny to \nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 16 \n(1958). While a State can act only through \"the officers or agents by whom its powers are \nexerted,\" Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 347 (1880), actions by an agent or officer of 793*793 the \nState are encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment for, \"as he acts in the name and for the \nState, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.\" Ibid. See \nalso Cooper v. Aaron, supra; Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 \nU. S. 1, 14 (1948). \nUnder Michigan law a \"school district is an agency of the State government.\" School District of the \nCity of Lansing v. State Board of Education, 367 Mich. 591, 600, 116 N. W. 2d 866, 870 (1962). It is \n\"a legal division of territory, created by the State for educational purposes, to which the State has \ngranted such powers as are deemed necessary to permit the district to function as a State \nagency.\" Detroit Board of Education v.Superintendent of Public Instruction, 319 Mich. 436, 450, 29 \nN. W. 2d 902, 908 (1947). Racial discrimination by the school district, an agency of the State, is \ntherefore racial discrimination by the State itself, forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. \ng., Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230 (1957). \nWe recognized only last Term in Keyes that it was the State itself which was ultimately responsible \nfor de jure acts of segregation committed by a local school board. A deliberate policy of segregation \nby the local board, we held, amounted to \"state-imposed segregation.\" 413 U. S., at 200. Wherever a \ndual school system exists, whether compelled by state statute or created by a local board's \nsystematic program of segregation, \"the State automatically assumes an affirmative duty `to \neffectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system' [and] to eliminate from the public \nschools within their school system `all vestiges of state-imposed segregation.' \" Ibid.(emphasis \nadded). \nVesting responsibility with the State of Michigan for Detroit's segregated schools is particularly \nappropriate as 794*794 Michigan, unlike some other States, operates a single statewide system of \neducation rather than several separate and independent local school systems. The majority's \nemphasis on local governmental control and local autonomy of school districts in Michigan will come \nas a surprise to those with any familiarity with that State's system of education. School districts are \nnot separate and distinct sovereign entities under Michigan law, but rather are \" `auxiliaries of the \nState,' \" subject to its \"absolute power.\" Attorney General of Michigan ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, 199 U. \nS. 233, 240 (1905). The courts of the State have repeatedly emphasized that education in Michigan \nis not a local governmental concern, but a state function. \n\"Unlike the delegation of other powers by the legislature to local governments, education is not \ninherently a part of the local self-government of a municipality . . . . Control of our public school \nsystem is a State matter delegated and lodged in the State legislature by the Constitution. The policy \nof the State has been to retain control of its school system, to be administered throughout the State \nunder State laws by local State agencies organized with plenary powers to carry out the delegated \nfunctions given [them] by the legislature.\" School District of the City of Lansing v. State Board of \nEducation, supra, at 595, 116 N. W. 2d, at 868. \nThe Supreme Court of Michigan has noted the deep roots of this policy: \n\"It has been settled by the Ordinance of 1787, the several Constitutions adopted in this State, by its \nuniform course of legislation, and by the decisions of this court, that education in Michigan is a \nmatter of State concern, that it is no part of the local self-government of a particular township or \nmunicipality 795*795. . . . The legislature has always dictated the educational policy of the State.\" In \nre School District No. 6, 284 Mich. 132, 145-146, 278 N. W. 792, 797 (1938). \n\nThe State's control over education is reflected in the fact that, contrary to the Court's implication, \nthere is little or no relationship between school districts and local political units. To take the 85 \noutlying local school districts in the Detroit metropolitan area as examples, 17 districts lie in two \ncounties, two in three counties. One district serves five municipalities; other suburban municipalities \nare fragmented into as many as six school districts. Nor is there any apparent state policy with \nregard to the size of school districts, as they now range from 2,000 to 285,000 students. \nCentralized state control manifests itself in practice as well as in theory. The State controls the \nfinancing of education in several ways. The legislature contributes a substantial portion of most \nschool districts' operating budgets with funds appropriated from the State's General Fund revenues \nraised through statewide taxation.[6] The State's power over the purse can be and is in fact used to \nenforce the State's powers over local districts.[7] In addition, although local districts obtain funds \nthrough local property taxation, the State has assumed the responsibility to ensure equalized \nproperty valuations throughout the State.[8] The State also establishes 796*796 standards for teacher \ncertification and teacher tenure;[9] determines part of the required curriculum;[10] sets the minimum \nschool term;[11] approves bus routes, equipment, and drivers;[12] approves textbooks;[13] and \nestablishes procedures for student discipline.[14] The State Superintendent of Public Instruction and \nthe State Board of Education have the power to remove local school board members from office for \nneglect of their duties.[15] \nMost significantly for present purposes, the State has wide-ranging powers to consolidate and merge \nschool districts, even without the consent of the districts themselves or of the local \ncitizenry.[16] See, e. g., Attorney General ex rel. Kies v.Lowrey, 131 Mich. 639, 92 N. W. 289 \n(1902), aff'd, 199 U. S. 233 (1905). Indeed, recent years have witnessed an accelerated program of \nschool district consolidations, mergers, and annexations, many of which were state imposed. \nWhereas the State had 7,362 local districts in 1912, the number had been reduced to 1,438 in 1964 \nand to 738 in 1968.[17]By June 1972, only 608 school districts remained. Furthermore, the State has \nbroad powers to transfer property from one district to another, again without the consent of the local \nschool districts affected by the transfer.[18] See, e. g., School District 797*797 of the City of \nLansing v. State Board of Education, supra; Imlay Township District v. State Board of Education, 359 \nMich. 478, 102 N. W. 2d 720 (1960). \nWhatever may be the history of public education in other parts of our Nation, it simply flies in the \nface of reality to say, as does the majority, that in Michigan, \"[n]o single tradition in public education \nis more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools . . . .\" Ante, at 741. As the \nState's Supreme Court has said: \"We have repeatedly held that education in this State is not a \nmatter of local concern, but belongs to the State at large.\" Collins v. City of Detroit, 195 Mich. 330, \n335-336, 161 N. W. 905, 907 (1917). See also Sturgis v. County of Allegan, 343 Mich. 209, 215, 72 \nN. W. 2d 56, 59 (1955); Van Fleet v. Oltman, 244 Mich. 241, 244, 221 N. W. 299, 300 (1928); Child \nWelfare Society of Flint v. Kennedy School District, 220 Mich. 290, 296, 189 N. W. 1002, 1004 \n(1922). Indeed, a study prepared for the 1961 Michigan Constitutional Convention noted that the \nMichigan Constitution's articles on education had resulted in \"the establishment of a state system of \neducation in contrast to a series of local school systems.\" Elementary and Secondary Education and \nthe Michigan Constitution, Michigan Constitutional Convention Studies 1 (1961). \nIn sum, several factors in this case coalesce to support the District Court's ruling that it was the State \nof Michigan itself, not simply the Detroit Board of Education, which bore the obligation of curing the \ncondition of segregation within the Detroit city schools. The actions of the State itself directly \ncontributed to Detroit's segregation. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the State is ultimately \nresponsible for the actions of its local agencies. And, finally, given the structure of Michigan's \neducational system, Detroit's segregation cannot be 798*798 viewed as the problem of an \nindependent and separate entity. Michigan operates a single statewide system of education, a \nsubstantial part of which was shown to be segregated in this case. \n\nB \nWhat action, then, could the District Court require the State to take in order to cure Detroit's \ncondition of segregation? Our prior cases have not minced words as to what steps responsible \nofficials and agencies must take in order to remedy segregation in the public schools. Not only must \ndistinctions on the basis of race be terminated for the future, but school officials are also \"clearly \ncharged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary \nsystem in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.\" Green v. County School \nBoard of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, 437-438 (1968). See also Lee v. Macon County Board of \nEducation, 267 F. Supp. 458 (MD Ala.), aff'd sub nom. Wallace v. United States, 389 U. S. 215 \n(1967). Negro students are not only entitled to neutral nondiscriminatory treatment in the future. \nThey must receive \"what Brown II promised them: a school system in which all vestiges of enforced \nracial segregation have been eliminated.\" Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451, \n463 (1972). See also Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971). \nThese remedial standards are fully applicable not only to school districts where a dual system was \ncompelled by statute, but also where, as here, a dual system was the product of purposeful and \nintentional state action. See Keyes, 413 U. S., at 200-201. \nAfter examining three plans limited to the city of Detroit, the District Court correctly concluded that \nnone would eliminate root and branch the vestiges of 799*799unconstitutional segregation. The \nplans' effectiveness, of course, had to be evaluated in the context of the District Court's findings as \nto the extent of segregation in the Detroit city schools. As indicated earlier, the most essential finding \nwas that Negro children in Detroit had been confined by intentional acts of segregation to a growing \ncore of Negro schools surrounded by a receding ring of white schools.[19] Thus, in 1960, of Detroit's \n251 800*800 regular-attendance schools, 100 were 90% or more white and 71 were 90% or more \nNegro. In 1970, of Detroit's 282 regular-attendance schools, 69 were 90% or more white and 133 \nwere 90% or more Negro. While in 1960, 68% of all schools were 90% or more one race, by 1970, \n71.6% of the schools fell into that category. The growing core of all-Negro schools was further \nevidenced in total school district population figures. In 1960 the Detroit system had 46% Negro \nstudents and 54% white students, but by 1970, 64% of the students were Negro and only 36% were \nwhite. This increase in the proportion of Negro students was the highest of any major Northern city. \nIt was with these figures in the background that the District Court evaluated the adequacy of the \nthree Detroit-only plans submitted by the parties. Plan A, proposed by the Detroit Board of \nEducation, desegregated the high schools and about a fifth of the middle-level schools. It was \ndeemed inadequate, however, because it did not desegregate elementary schools and left the \nmiddle-level schools not included in the plan more segregated than ever. Plan C, also proposed by \nthe Detroit Board, was deemed inadequate because it too covered only some grade levels and \nwould leave elementary schools segregated. Plan B, the plaintiffs' plan, though requiring the \ntransportation of 82,000 pupils and the acquisition of 900 school buses, would make \nlittle 801*801 headway in rooting out the vestiges of segregation. To begin with, because of practical \nlimitations, the District Court found that the plan would leave many of the Detroit city schools 75% to \n90% Negro. More significantly, the District Court recognized that in the context of a community which \nhistorically had a school system marked by rigid de jure segregation, the likely effect of a Detroit-only \nplan would be to \"change a school system which is now Black and White to one that would be \nperceived as Black . . . .\" The result of this changed perception, the District Court found, would be to \nincrease the flight of whites from the city to the outlying suburbs, compounding the effects of the \npresent rate of increase in the proportion of Negro students in the Detroit system. Thus, even if a \nplan were adopted which, at its outset, provided in every school a 65% Negro-35% white racial mix \nin keeping with the Negro-white proportions of the total student population, such a system would, in \nshort order, devolve into an all-Negro system. The net result would be a continuation of the all-Negro \nschools which were the hallmarks of Detroit's former dual system of one-race schools. \n\nUnder our decisions, it was clearly proper for the District Court to take into account the so-called \n\"white flight\" from the city schools which would be forthcoming from any Detroit-only decree. The \ncourt's prediction of white flight was well supported by expert testimony based on past experience in \nother cities undergoing desegregation relief. We ourselves took the possibility of white flight into \naccount in evaluating the effectiveness of a desegregation plan in Wright, supra, where we relied on \nthe District Court's finding that if the city of Emporia were allowed to withdraw from the existing \nsystem, leaving a system with a higher proportion of Negroes, it \" `may be anticipated that the \nproportion 802*802 of whites in county schools may drop as those who can register in private \nacademies' . . . .\" 407 U. S., at 464. One cannot ignore the white-flight problem, for where legally \nimposed segregation has been established, the District Court has the responsibility to see to it not \nonly that the dual system is terminated at once but also that future events do not serve to perpetuate \nor re-establish segregation. See Swann, 402 U. S., at 21. See also Green, 391 U. S., at 438 n. \n4; Monroe v. Board of Comm'rs, 391 U. S. 450, 459 (1968). \nWe held in Swann, supra, that where de jure segregation is shown, school authorities must make \n\"every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation.\" 402 U. S., at 26. This \nis the operative standard re-emphasized in Davisv. School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U. S. 33, \n37 (1971). If these words have any meaning at all, surely it is that school authorities must, to the \nextent possible, take all practicable steps to ensure that Negro and white children in fact go to school \ntogether. This is, in the final analysis, what desegregation of the public schools is all about. \nBecause of the already high and rapidly increasing percentage of Negro students in the Detroit \nsystem, as well as the prospect of white flight, a Detroit-only plan simply has no hope of achieving \nactual desegregation. Under such a plan white and Negro students will not go to school together. \nInstead, Negro children will continue to attend all-Negro schools. The very evil that Brown I was \naimed at will not be cured, but will be perpetuated for the future. \nRacially identifiable schools are one of the primary vestiges of state-imposed segregation which an \neffective desegregation decree must attempt to eliminate. In Swann, supra, for example, we held \nthat \"[t]he district judge or school authorities . . . will thus necessarily be concerned with the \nelimination of one-race schools.\" 402 803*803 U. S., at 26. There is \"a presumption,\" we stated, \n\"against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition.\" Ibid. And in \nevaluating the effectiveness of desegregation plans in prior cases, we ourselves have considered \nthe extent to which they discontinued racially identifiable schools. See, e. g., Green v. County School \nBoard of New Kent County, supra; Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, supra. For a principal \nend of any desegregation remedy is to ensure that it is no longer \"possible to identify a `white school' \nor a `Negro school.' \" Swann, supra, at 18. The evil to be remedied in the dismantling of a dual \nsystem is the \"[r]acial identification of the system's schools.\" Green, 391 U. S., at 435. The goal is a \nsystem without white schools or Negro schools—a system with \"just schools.\" Id., at 442. A school \nauthority's remedial plan or a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effectiveness in \nachieving this end. See Swann, supra, at 25; Davis, supra, at 37; Green, supra, at 439. \nWe cautioned in Swann, of course, that the dismantling of a segregated school system does not \nmandate any particular racial balance. 402 U. S., at 24. We also concluded that a remedy under \nwhich there would remain a small number of racially identifiable schools was only presumptively \ninadequate and might be justified. Id., at 26. But this is a totally different case. The flaw of a Detroit-\nonly decree is not that it does not reach some ideal degree of racial balance or mixing. It simply does \nnot promise to achieve actual desegregation at all. It is one thing to have a system where a small \nnumber of students remain in racially identifiable schools. It is something else entirely to have a \nsystem where all students continue to attend such schools. \n\nThe continued racial identifiability of the Detroit schools under a Detroit-only remedy is not simply a \nreflection of their high percentage of Negro students. 804*804 What is or is not a racially identifiable \nvestige of de jure segregation must necessarily depend on several factors. Cf. Keyes, 413 U. S., at \n196. Foremost among these should be the relationship between the schools in question and the \nneighboring community. For these purposes the city of Detroit and its surrounding suburbs must be \nviewed as a single community. Detroit is closely connected to its suburbs in many ways, and the \nmetropolitan area is viewed as a single cohesive unit by its residents. About 40% of the residents of \nthe two suburban counties included in the desegregation plan work in Wayne County, in which \nDetroit is situated. Many residents of the city work in the suburbs. The three counties participate in a \nwide variety of cooperative governmental ventures on a metropolitan-wide basis, including a \nmetropolitan transit system, park authority, water and sewer system, and council of governments. \nThe Federal Government has classified the tri-county area as a Standard Metropolitan Statistical \nArea, indicating that it is an area of \"economic and social integration.\" United States v. Connecticut \nNational Bank, ante, at 670. \nUnder a Detroit-only decree, Detroit's schools will clearly remain racially identifiable in comparison \nwith neighboring schools in the metropolitan community. Schools with 65% and more Negro \nstudents will stand in sharp and obvious contrast to schools in neighboring districts with less than \n2% Negro enrollment. Negro students will continue to perceive their schools as segregated \neducational facilities and this perception will only be increased when whites react to a Detroit-only \ndecree by fleeing to the suburbs to avoid integration. School district lines, however innocently drawn, \nwill surely be perceived as fences to separate the races when, under a Detroit-only decree, white \nparents withdraw their children 805*805 from the Detroit city schools and move to the suburbs in \norder to continue them in all-white schools. The message of this action will not escape the Negro \nchildren in the city of Detroit. See Wright, 407 U. S., at 466. It will be of scant significance to Negro \nchildren who have for years been confined by de jureacts of segregation to a growing core of all-\nNegro schools surrounded by a ring of all-white schools that the new dividing line between the races \nis the school district boundary. \nNor can it be said that the State is free from any responsibility for the disparity between the racial \nmakeup of Detroit and its surrounding suburbs. The State's creation, through de jure acts of \nsegregation, of a growing core of all-Negro schools inevitably acted as a magnet to attract Negroes \nto the areas served by such schools and to deter them from settling either in other areas of the city \nor in the suburbs. By the same token, the growing core of all-Negro schools inevitably helped drive \nwhites to other areas of the city or to the suburbs. As we recognized in Swann: \n\"People gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of \npeople. The location of schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development of a \nmetropolitan area and have important impact on composition of inner-city neighborhoods. . . . [Action \ntaken] to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum departure from the formal principles of \n`neighborhood zoning' . . . does more than simply influence the short-run composition of the student \nbody . . . . It may well promote segregated residential patterns which, when combined with \n`neighborhood zoning,' further lock the school system into the mold of separation of the races. Upon \na proper 806*806 showing a district court may consider this in fashioning a remedy.\" 402 U. S., at \n20-21. \nSee also Keyes, 413 U. S., at 202. The rippling effects on residential patterns caused by purposeful \nacts of segregation do not automatically subside at the school district border. With rare exceptions, \nthese effects naturally spread through all the residential neighborhoods within a metropolitan area. \nSee id., at 202-203. \n\nThe State must also bear part of the blame for the white flight to the suburbs which would be \nforthcoming from a Detroit-only decree and would render such a remedy ineffective. Having created \na system where whites and Negroes were intentionally kept apart so that they could not become \naccustomed to learning together, the State is responsible for the fact that many whites will react to \nthe dismantling of that segregated system by attempting to flee to the suburbs. Indeed, by limiting \nthe District Court to a Detroit-only remedy and allowing that flight to the suburbs to succeed, the \nCourt today allows the State to profit from its own wrong and to perpetuate for years to come the \nseparation of the races it achieved in the past by purposeful state action. \nThe majority asserts, however, that involvement of outlying districts would do violence to the \naccepted principle that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\" Swann, \nsupra, at 16. See ante, at 744-745. Not only is the majority's attempt to find in this single phrase the \nanswer to the complex and difficult questions presented in this case hopelessly simplistic, but more \nimportant, the Court reads these words in a manner which perverts their obvious meaning. The \nnature of a violation determines the scope of the remedy simply because the function of any remedy \nis to cure the violation to which it is addressed. In school segregation 807*807 cases, as in other \nequitable causes, a remedy which effectively cures the violation is what is required. See Green, 391 \nU. S., at 439; Davis, 402 U. S., at 37. No more is necessary, but we can tolerate no less. To read \nthis principle as barring a district court from imposing the only effective remedy for past segregation \nand remitting the court to a patently ineffective alternative is, in my view, to turn a simple \ncommonsense rule into a cruel and meaningless paradox. Ironically, by ruling out an interdistrict \nremedy, the only relief which promises to cure segregation in the Detroit public schools, the majority \nflouts the very principle on which it purports to rely. \nNor should it be of any significance that the suburban school districts were not shown to have \nthemselves taken any direct action to promote segregation of the races. Given the State's broad \npowers over local school districts, it was well within the State's powers to require those districts \nsurrounding the Detroit school district to participate in a metropolitan remedy. The State's duty \nshould be no different here than in cases where it is shown that certain of a State's voting districts \nare malapportioned in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 \n(1964). Overrepresented electoral districts are required to participate in reapportionment although \ntheir only \"participation\" in the violation was to do nothing about it. Similarly, electoral districts which \nthemselves meet representation standards must frequently be redrawn as part of a remedy for other \nover- and under-inclusive districts. No finding of fault on the part of each electoral district and no \nfinding of a discriminatory effect on each district is a prerequisite to its involvement in the \nconstitutionally required remedy. By the same logic, no finding of fault on the part of the suburban \nschool districts in this case 808*808 and no finding of a discriminatory effect on each district should \nbe a prerequisite to their involvement in the constitutionally required remedy. \nIt is the State, after all, which bears the responsibility under Brown of affording a nondiscriminatory \nsystem of education. The State, of course, is ordinarily free to choose any decentralized framework \nfor education it wishes, so long as it fulfills that Fourteenth Amendment obligation. But the State \nshould no more be allowed to hide behind its delegation and compartmentalization of school districts \nto avoid its constitutional obligations to its children than it could hide behind its political subdivisions \nto avoid its obligations to its voters. Reynolds v. Sims, supra, at 575. See \nalso Gomillion v. Lightfoot,364 U. S. 339 (1960). \nIt is a hollow remedy indeed where \"after supposed `desegregation' the schools remained \nsegregated in fact.\" Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401, 495 (DDC 1967). We must do better than \n\" `substitute . . . one segregated school system for another segregated school system.' \" Wright, 407 \nU. S., at 456. To suggest, as does the majority, that a Detroit-only plan somehow remedies the \neffects of de jure segregation of the races is, in my view, to make a solemn mockery of Brown I's \nholding that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and of Swann's unequivocal \n\nmandate that the answer to de jure segregation is the greatest possible degree of actual \ndesegregation. \nIII \nOne final set of problems remains to be considered. We recognized in Brown II, and have re-\nemphasized ever since, that in fashioning relief in desegregation cases, \"the courts will be guided by \nequitable principles. Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping \nits remedies and by a facility for 809*809 adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.\" Brown \nII, 349 U. S., at 300. See also Swann, supra. \nThough not resting its holding on this point, the majority suggests that various equitable \nconsiderations militate against interdistrict relief. The Court, for example, refers to financing and \nadministrative problems, the logistical problems attending large-scale transportation of students, and \nthe prospect of the District Court's becoming a \"de facto`legislative authority' \" and \" `school \nsuperintendent' for the entire area.\" Ante, at 743-744. The entangling web of problems woven by the \nCourt, however, appears on further consideration to be constructed of the flimsiest of threads. \nI deal first with the last of the problems posed by the Court—the specter of the District \nCourt qua \"school superintendent\" and \"legislative authority\"—for analysis of this problem helps put \nthe other issues in proper perspective. Our cases, of course, make clear that the initial responsibility \nfor devising an adequate desegregation plan belongs with school authorities, not with the District \nCourt. The court's primary role is to review the adequacy of the school authorities' efforts and to \nsubstitute its own plan only if and to the extent they default. See Swann, 402 U. S., at \n16; Green, 391 U. S., at 439. Contrary to the majority's suggestions, the District Judge in this case \nconsistently adhered to these procedures and there is every indication that he would have continued \nto do so. After finding de jure segregation the court ordered the parties to submit proposed Detroit-\nonly plans. The state defendants were also ordered to submit a proposed metropolitan plan \nextending beyond Detroit's boundaries. As the District Court stated, \"the State defendants . . . bear \nthe initial burden of coming forward with a proposal that promises to work.\" The state defendants \ndefaulted in this obligation, however. 810*810Rather than submit a complete plan, the State Board of \nEducation submitted six proposals, none of which was in fact a desegregation plan. It was only upon \nthis default that the District Court began to take steps to develop its own plan. Even then the District \nCourt maximized school authority participation by appointing a panel representing both plaintiffs and \ndefendants to develop a plan. Pet. App. 99a-100a. Furthermore, the District Court still left the state \ndefendants the initial responsibility for developing both interim and final financial and administrative \narrangements to implement interdistrict relief. Id., at 104a-105a. The Court of Appeals further \nprotected the interests of local school authorities by ensuring that the outlying suburban districts \ncould fully participate in the proceedings to develop a metropolitan remedy. \nThese processes have not been allowed to run their course. No final desegregation plan has been \nproposed by the panel of experts, let alone approved by the District Court. We do not know in any \ndetail how many students will be transported to effect a metropolitan remedy, and we do not know \nhow long or how far they will have to travel. No recommendations have yet been submitted by the \nstate defendants on financial and administrative arrangements. In sum, the practicality of a final \nmetropolitan plan is simply not before us at the present time. Since the State and the panel of \nexperts have not yet had an opportunity to come up with a workable remedy, there is no foundation \nfor the majority's suggestion of the impracticality of interdistrict relief. Furthermore, there is no basis \nwhatever for assuming that the District Court will inevitably be forced to assume the role of \nlegislature or school superintendent.[20] 811*811 Were we to hold that it was its constitutional duty to \ndo so, there is every indication that the State of Michigan would fulfill its obligation and develop a \n\nplan which is workable, administrable, financially sound, and, most important, in the best interest of \nquality education for all of the children in the Detroit metropolitan area. \nSince the Court chooses, however, to speculate on the feasibility of a metropolitan plan, I feel \nconstrained to comment on the problem areas it has targeted. To begin with, the majority's questions \nconcerning the practicality of consolidation of school districts need not give us pause. The State \nclearly has the power, under existing law, to effect a consolidation if it is ultimately determined that \nthis offers the best prospect for a workable and stable desegregation plan. See supra, at 796-797. \nAnd given the 1,000 or so consolidations of school districts which have taken place in the past, it is \nhard to believe that the State has not already devised means of solving most, if not all, of the \npractical problems which the Court suggests consolidation would entail. \nFurthermore, the majority ignores long-established Michigan procedures under which school districts \nmay enter into contractual agreements to educate their pupils in other districts using state or local \nfunds to finance non-resident education.[21] Such agreements could form an 812*812 easily \nadministrable framework for interdistrict relief short of outright consolidation of the school districts. \nThe District Court found that interdistrict procedures like these were frequently used to provide \nspecial educational services for handicapped children, and extensive statutory provision is also \nmade for their use in vocational education.[22] Surely if school districts are willing to engage in \ninterdistrict programs to help those unfortunate children crippled by physical or mental handicaps, \nschool districts can be required to participate in an interdistrict program to help those children in the \ncity of Detroit whose educations and very futures have been crippled by purposeful state \nsegregation. \nAlthough the majority gives this last matter only fleeting reference, it is plain that one of the basic \nemotional and legal issues underlying these cases concerns the propriety of transportation of \nstudents to achieve desegregation. While others may have retreated from its standards, see, e. \ng., Keyes, 413 U. S., at 217 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I continue to \nadhere to the guidelines set forth in Swann on this issue. See 402 U. S., at 29-31. And though no \nfinal desegregation plan is presently before us, to the extent the outline of such a plan is now visible, \nit is clear that the transportation it would entail will be fully consistent with these guidelines. \nFirst of all, the metropolitan plan would not involve the busing of substantially more students than \nalready ride buses. The District Court found that, statewide, 35%-40% of all students already arrive \nat school on a bus. In those school districts in the tri-county Detroit metropolitan area eligible for \nstate reimbursement of transportation costs, 42%-52% of all students rode buses to school. In the \ntri-county areas as a whole, approximately 813*813 300,000 pupils arrived at school on some type of \nbus, with about 60,000 of these apparently using regular public transit. In comparison, the \ndesegregation plan, according to its present rough outline, would involve the transportation of \n310,000 students, about 40% of the population within the desegregation area. \nWith respect to distance and amount of time traveled, 17 of the outlying school districts involved in \nthe plan are contiguous to the Detroit district. The rest are all within 8 miles of the Detroit city limits. \nThe trial court, in defining the desegregation area, placed a ceiling of 40 minutes one way on the \namount of travel time, and many students will obviously travel for far shorter periods. As to distance, \nthe average statewide bus trip is 8 1/2 miles one way, and in some parts of the tri-county area, \nstudents already travel for one and a quarter hours or more each way. In sum, with regard to both \nthe number of students transported and the time and distances involved, the outlined desegregation \nplan \"compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated . . . .\" Swann, supra, at 30. \nAs far as economics are concerned, a metropolitan remedy would actually be more sensible than a \nDetroit-only remedy. Because of prior transportation aid restrictions, see supra, at 791, Detroit \n\nlargely relied on public transport, at student expense, for those students who lived too far away to \nwalk to school. Since no inventory of school buses existed, a Detroit-only plan was estimated to \nrequire the purchase of 900 buses to effectuate the necessary transportation. The tri-county area, in \ncontrast, already has an inventory of 1,800 buses, many of which are now under-utilized. Since \nincreased utilization of the existing inventory can take up much of the increase in transportation \ninvolved in the interdistrict remedy, the District Court found that only 350 additional buses \nwould 814*814 probably be needed, almost two-thirds fewer than a Detroit-only remedy. Other \nfeatures of an interdistrict remedy bespeak its practicality, such as the possibility of pairing up Negro \nschools near Detroit's boundary with nearby white schools on the other side of the present school \ndistrict line. \nSome disruption, of course, is the inevitable product of any desegregation decree, whether it \noperates within one district or on an interdistrict basis. As we said in Swann,however: \n\"Absent a constitutional violation there would be no basis for judicially ordering assignment of \nstudents on a racial basis. All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be \ndesirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes. But all things are not equal in a system \nthat has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation. The remedy for \nsuch segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some \nsituations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be \navoided . . . .\" 402 U. S., at 28. \nDesegregation is not and was never expected to be an easy task. Racial attitudes ingrained in our \nNation's childhood and adolescence are not quickly thrown aside in its middle years. But just as the \ninconvenience of some cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the rights of others, so public \nopposition, no matter how strident, cannot be permitted to divert this Court from the enforcement of \nthe constitutional principles at issue in this case. Today's holding, I fear, is more a reflection of a \nperceived public mood that we have gone far enough in enforcing the Constitution's guarantee of \nequal justice than it is the product of neutral principles of law. In 815*815 the short run, it may seem \nto be the easier course to allow our great metropolitan areas to be divided up each into two cities—\none white, the other black—but it is a course, I predict, our people will ultimately regret. I dissent. \n[*] Together with No. 73-435, Allen Park Public Schools et al. v. Bradley et al., and No. 73-436, Grosse Pointe Public School \nSystem v.

The Constitution of the State of Michigan, Art. 8, § 2, provides in relevant part: \n\"The legislature shall maintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary schools as defined by law.\" \nSimilarly, the Michigan Supreme Court has stated: \"The school district is a State agency.

Pub. Acts of 1970; Mich. Comp. Laws § 388.182 (1970) (emphasis added). \n[7] The District Court briefly alluded to the possibility that the State, along with private persons, had caused, in part, the \nhousing patterns of the Detroit metropolitan area which, in turn, produced the predominantly white and predominantly Negro \nneighborhoods that characterize Detroit: \n\"It is no answer to say that restricted practices grew gradually (as the black population in the area increased between 1920 \nand 1970), or that since 1948 racial restrictions on the ownership of real property have been removed. The policies pursued \nby both government and private persons and agencies have a continuing and present effect upon the complexion of the \ncommunity—as we know, the choice of a residence is a relatively infrequent affair. For many years FHA and VA openly \nadvised and advocated the maintenance of `harmonious' neighborhoods, i. e., racially and economically harmonious. The \nconditions created continue.\" 338 F. Supp. 582, 587 (ED Mich. 1971). \nThus, the District Court concluded: \n\"The affirmative obligation of the defendant Board has been and is to adopt and implement pupil assignment practices and \npolicies that compensate for and avoid incorporation into the school system the effects of residential racial \nsegregation.\" Id., at 593. \nThe Court of Appeals, however, expressly noted that: \n\"In affirming the District Judge's findings of constitutional violations by the Detroit Board of Education and by the State \ndefendants resulting in segregated schools in Detroit, we have not relied at all upon testimony pertaining to segregated \nhousing except as school construction programs helped cause or maintain such segregation.\" 484 F. 2d, at 242. \nAccordingly, in its present posture, the case does not present any question concerning possible state housing violations. \n[8] On March 22, 1971, a group of Detroit residents, who were parents of children enrolled in the Detroit public schools, were \npermitted to intervene as parties defendant. On June 24, 1971, the District Judge alluded to the \"possibility\" of a \nmetropolitan school system stating: \"[A]s I have said to several witnesses in this case: `How do you desegregate a black \ncity, or a black school system.' \" Petitioners' Appendix 243a (hereinafter Pet. App.). Subsequently, on July 16, 1971, various \nparents filed a motion to require joinder of all of the 85 outlying independent school districts within the tri-county area. \n[9] The respondents, as plaintiffs below, opposed the motion to join the additional school districts, arguing that the presence \nof the state defendants was sufficient and all that was required, even if, in shaping a remedy, the affairs of these other \ndistricts was to be affected. 338 F. Supp., at 595. \n[10] At the time of the 1970 census, the population of Michigan was 8,875,083, almost half of which, 4,199,931, resided in \nthe tri-county area of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb. Oakland and Macomb Counties about Wayne County to the north, and \nOakland County abuts Macomb County to the west. These counties cover 1,952 square miles, Michigan Statistical Abstract \n\n(9th ed. 1972), and the area is approximately the size of the State of Delaware (2,057 square miles), more than half again \nthe size of the State of Rhode Island (1,214 square miles) and almost 30 times the size of the District of Columbia (67 \nsquare miles). Statistical Abstract of the United States (93d ed. 1972). The populations of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb \nCounties were 2,666,751; 907,871; and 625,309, respectively, in 1970. Detroit, the State's largest city, is located in Wayne \nCounty. \nIn the 1970-1971 school year, there were 2,157,449 children enrolled in school districts in Michigan. There are 86 \nindependent, legally distinct school districts within the tri-county area, having a total enrollment of approximately 1,000,000 \nchildren. In 1970, the Detroit Board of Education operated 319 schools with approximately 276,000 students. \n[11] In its formal opinion, subsequently announced, the District Court candidly recognized: \n\"It should be noted that the court has taken no proofs with respect to the establishment of the boundaries of the 86 public \nschool districts in the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb, nor on the issue of whether, with the exclusion of the city of \nDetroit school district, such school districts have committed acts of de jure segregation.\" 345 F. Supp. 914, 920 (ED Mich. \n1972). \n[12] According to the District Court, intervention was permitted under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24 (a), \"Intervention of Right,\" and \nalso under Rule 24 (b), \"Permissive Intervention.\" \n[13] This rather abbreviated briefing schedule was maintained despite the fact that the District Court had deferred \nconsideration of a motion made eight months earlier, to bring the suburban districts into the case. See text accompanying n. \n8, supra. \n[14] As of 1970, the 53 school districts outside the city of Detroit that were included in the court's \"desegregation area\" had a \ncombined student population of approximately 503,000 students compared to Detroit's approximately 276,000 students. \nNevertheless, the District Court directed that the intervening districts should be represented by only one member on the \ndesegregation panel while the Detroit Board of Education was granted three panel members. 345 F. Supp., at 917. \n[15] The District Court had certified most of the foregoing rulings for interlocutory review pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b) \n(1 App. 265-266) and the case was initially decided on the merits by a panel of three judges. However, the panel's opinion \nand judgment were vacated when it was determined to rehear the case en banc, 484 F. 2d, at 218. \n[16] With respect to the State's violations, the Court of Appeals held: (1) that, since the city Board is an instrumentality of the \nState and subordinate to the State Board, the segregative actions of the Detroit Board \"are the actions of an agency of the \nState,\" id., at 238; (2) that the state legislation rescinding Detroit's voluntary desegregation plan contributed to increasing \nsegregation in the Detroit schools, ibid.; (3) that under state law prior to 1962 the State Board had authority over school \nconstruction plans and therefore had to be held responsible \"for the segregative results,\" ibid.; (4) that the \"State statutory \nscheme of support of transportation for school children directly discriminated against Detroit,\" id., at 240, by not providing \ntransportation funds to Detroit on the same basis as funds were provided to suburban districts, id., at 238; and (5) that the \ntransportation of Negro students from one suburban district to a Negro school in Detroit must have had the \"approval, tacit or \nexpress, of the State Board of Education,\" ibid. \n[17] The court sought to distinguish Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 462 F. 2d 1058 (CA4 1972), aff'd by an \nequally divided Court, 412 U. S. 92 (1973), on the grounds that the District Court in that case had ordered an actual \nconsolidation of three school districts and that Virginia's Constitution and statutes, unlike Michigan's, gave the local boards \nexclusive power to operate the public schools. 484 F. 2d, at 251. \n[18] Although the list of issues presented for review in petitioners' briefs and petitions for writs of certiorari do not include \narguments on the findings of segregative violations on the part of the Detroit defendants, two of the petitioners argue in brief \nthat these findings constitute error. This Court's Rules 23 (1) (c) and 40 (1) (d) (2), at a minimum, limit our review of the \nDetroit violation findings to \"plain error,\" and, under our decision last Term in Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, \nColorado, 413 U. S. 189 (1973), the findings appear to be correct. \n[19] Disparity in the racial composition of pupils within a single district may well constitute a \"signal\" to a district court at the \noutset, leading to inquiry into the causes accounting for a pronounced racial identifiability of schools within one school \nsystem. In Swann, for example, we were dealing with a large but single independent school system, and a unanimous Court \nnoted: \"Where the . . . proposed plan for conversion from a dual to a unitary system contemplates the continued existence of \nsome schools that are all or predominantly of one race [the school authority has] the burden of showing that such school \nassignments are genuinely nondiscriminatory.\" 402 U. S., at 26. See also Keyes, supra, at 208. However, the use of \nsignificant racial imbalance in schools within an autonomous school district as a signal which operates simply to shift the \n\nburden of proof, is a very different matter from equating racial imbalance with a constitutional violation calling for a \nremedy. Keyes, supra, also involved a remedial order within a single autonomous school district. \n[20] Under the Michigan School Code of 1955, the local school district is an autonomous political body corporate, operating \nthrough a Board of Education popularly elected. Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 340.27, 340.55, 340.107, 340.148, 340.149, 340.188. \nAs such, the day-to-day affairs of the school district are determined at the local level in accordance with the plenary power to \nacquire real and personal property, §§ 340.26, 340.77, 340.113, 340.165, 340.192, 340.352; to hire and contract with \npersonnel, §§ 340.569, 340.574; to levy taxes for operations, § 340.563; to borrow against receipts, § 340.567; to determine \nthe length of school terms, § 340.575; to control the admission of nonresident students, § 340.582; to determine courses of \nstudy, § 340.583; to provide a kindergarten program, § 340.584; to establish and operate vocational schools, § 340.585; to \noffer adult education programs, § 340.586; to establish attendance areas, § 340.589; to arrange for transportation of \nnonresident students, § 340.591; to acquire transportation equipment, § 340.594; to receive gifts and bequests for \neducational purposes, § 340.605; to employ an attorney, § 340.609; to suspend or expel students, § 340.613; to make rules \nand regulations for the operation of schools, § 340.614; to cause to be levied authorized millage, § 340.643a; to acquire \nproperty by eminent domain, § 340.711 et seq.; and to approve and select textbooks, § 340.882. \n[21] Since the Court has held that a resident of a school district has a fundamental right protected by the Federal \nConstitution to vote in a district election, it would seem incongruous to disparage the importance of the school district in a \ndifferent context. Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15, 395 U. S. 621, 626 (1969). While the district there involved \nwas located in New York, none of the facts in our possession suggest that the relation of school districts to the State is \nsignificantly different in New York from that in Michigan. \n[22] The suggestion in the dissent of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL that schools which have a majority of Negro students are \nnot \"desegregated,\" whatever the racial makeup of the school district's population and however neutrally the district lines \nhave been drawn and administered, finds no support in our prior cases. In Green v. County School Board of New Kent \nCounty, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), for example, this Court approved a desegregation plan which would have resulted in each of \nthe schools within the district having a racial composition of 57% Negro and 43% white. In Wright v. Council of the City of \nEmporia, 407 U. S. 451 (1972), the optimal desegregation plan would have resulted in the schools' being 66% Negro and \n34% white, substantially the same percentages as could be obtained under one of the plans involved in this case. And \nin United States v. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U. S. 484, 491 n. 5 (1972), a desegregation plan was implicitly \napproved for a school district which had a racial composition of 77% Negro and 22% white. In none of these cases was it \neven intimated that \"actual desegregation\" could not be accomplished as long as the number of Negro students was greater \nthan the number of white students. \nThe dissents also seem to attach importance to the metropolitan character of Detroit and neighboring school districts. But \nthe constitutional principles applicable in school desegregation cases cannot vary in accordance with the size or population \ndispersal of the particular city, county, or school district as compared with neighboring areas. \n[23] People ex rel. Workman v. Board of Education of Detroit, 18 Mich. 400 (1869): Act 34, § 28, Mich. Pub. Acts of 1867. \nThe Michigan Constitution and laws provide that \"[e]very school district shall provide for the education of its pupils without \ndiscrimination as to religion, ereed, race, color or national origin.\" Mich. Const. 1963, Art. 8, § 2; that \"[n]o separate school or \ndepartment shall be kept for any person or persons on account of race or color,\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 340.355; and that \"[a]ll \npersons, residents of a school district . . . shall have an equal right to attend school therein,\" id., § 340.356. See also Act \n319, Part II, c. 2, § 9, Mich. Pub. Acts of 1927. \n[24] Apparently, when the District Court, sua sponte, abruptly altered the theory of the case to include the possibility of \nmultidistrict relief, neither the plaintiffs nor the trial judge considered amending the complaint to embrace the new theory. \n[1] As this Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300: \"[E]quity has been characterized by a practical \nflexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs. These [school \ndesegregation] cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.\" \n[2] My Brother MARSHALL seems to ignore this fundamental fact when he states, post, at 799, that \"the most essential \nfinding [made by the District Court] was that Negro children in Detroit had been confined by intentional acts of segregation to \na growing core of Negro schools surrounded by a receding ring of white schools.\" This conclusion is simply not \nsubstantiated by the record presented in this case. The record here does support the claim made by the respondents that \nwhite and Negro students within Detroit who otherwise would have attended school together were separated by acts of the \nState or its subdivision. However, segregative acts within the city alone cannot be presumed to have produced—and no \nfactual showing was made that they did produce—an increase in the number of Negro students in the city as a whole. It is \nthis essential fact of a predominantly Negro school population in Detroit —caused by unknown and perhaps unknowable \nfactors such as in-migration, birth rates, economic changes, or cumulative acts of private racial fears—that accounts for the \n\"growing core of Negro schools,\" a \"core\" that has grown to include virtually the entire city. The Constitution simply does not \n\nallow federal courts to attempt to change that situation unless and until it is shown that the State, or its political subdivisions, \nhave contributed to cause the situation to exist. No record has been made in this case showing that the racial composition of \nthe Detroit school population or that residential patterns within Detroit and in the surrounding areas were in any significant \nmeasure caused by governmental activity, and it follows that the situation over which my dissenting Brothers express \nconcern cannot serve as the predicate for the remedy adopted by the District Court and approved by the Court of Appeals. \n[1] Mich. Const., Art. 8, §§ 2, 3. \n[2] See 484 F. 2d 215, 247-248; Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 340.402, 340.431, 340.447, 388.681 (1970). \n[3] Mich. Comp. Laws § 388.851 (1948), as amended by Act 231, Mich. Pub.

Michigan has recently passed legislation which could eliminate some, \nbut not all, of the inequities in school financing. See Act 101, Mich. Pub. Acts of 1973. \n[7] See 484 F. 2d, at 246-247; Mich. Const. Art. 8, §§ 2, 3. \n[8] See n. 2, supra. \n[9] A tremendous change has occurred in the distribution of this country's black population since World War I. See Hauser, \nDemographic Factors in the Integration of the Negro, Daedalus 847-877 (fall 1965). In 1910, 73% of all blacks lived on farms \nand in rural areas; by 1960, 73% lived in urban areas, mainly in the largest metropolitan areas. Moreover, due to the fact \nthat the black population is younger than the white population, the concentration of blacks in the cities is even more \npronounced for the school-age population. The pattern of change which has existed since World War I is continuing, and \nhence the proportion of blacks in the urban North and West will continue to increase. Dept. of Health, Education, and \nWelfare, J. Coleman et al., Equality of Educational Opportunity 39-40 (1966). \n[10] \"There are some definite and systematic directions of difference between the schools attended by minorities and those \nattended by the majority. It appears to be in the most academically related areas that the schools of minority pupils show the \nmost consistent deficiencies.\" Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, Coleman et al., supra, n. 9, at 120. \n[11] That some school districts are markedly poorer than others is beyond question. The California Supreme Court has \nnoted that per-pupil expenditures in two different districts—both located in the same county—were $2,223 and \n$616. Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal. 3d 584, 600 n. 15, 487 P. 2d 1241, 1252 n. 15 (1971). In New York the Fleischmann \nCommission reported that the two Long Island districts of Great Neck and Levittown spent $2,078 and $1,189 respectively \nper pupil. 1 New York State Commission on the Quality, Cost, and Financing of Elementary and Secondary Education, \nFleischmann Report 58 (1973). \"A further glaring inequity resulting from the current systems of school finance is that \nvariations in per pupil expenditures among school districts tend to be inversely related to educational need. City students, \nwith greater than average educational deficiencies, consistently have less money spent on their education and have higher \npupil/teacher ratios than do their high-income counterparts in the favored schools of suburbia.\" Glickstein & Want, Inequality \nin School Financing: The Role of the Law, 25 Stan. L. Rev. 335, 338 (1973). \n[12] Cities face an especially difficult problem in paying the cost of education, since they have the \"municipal overburden\" \nwhich results from greater costs for health, public safety, sanitation, public works, transportation, public welfare, public \nhousing, and recreation. Because of municipal overburden, cities on the average devote only about 30% of their budgets to \ntheir schools. This compares with the over 50% which is spent on schools by the suburbs. J. Berke & J. Callahan. Inequities \nin School Finance (1971), reprinted in Senate Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., \nReport on Issues in School Finance 129, 142 (Comm. Print 1972); see Glickstein & Want, supra, n. 11, at 387. \n[13] MR. JUSTICE STEWART indicates that equitable factors weigh in favor of local school control and the avoidance of \nadministrative difficulty given the lack of an \"interdistrict\" violation. Ante, at 755. It would seem to me that the equities are \nstronger in favor of the children of Detroit who have been deprived of their constitutional right to equal treatment by the State \nof Michigan. \n\n[1] The percentage of Negro pupils in the Detroit student population rose to 64.9% in 1971, to 67.3% in 1972, and to 69.8% \nin 1973, amid a metropolitan school population whose racial composition in 1970 was 81% white and 19% Negro. 5 App. 16; \nRacial-Ethnic Distribution of Students and Employees in the Detroit Public Schools, October 1972, and October 1973; 484 F. \n2d 215, 250. \n[2] The District Court's ruling on the Detroit-only desegregation plans is set out in full by the Court of Appeals, id.,at 242-245, \nand is not otherwise officially reported. \n[3] The Court has previously disapproved the implementation of proposed desegregation plans which operate to permit \nresegregation. Monroe v. Board of Comm'rs, 391 U. S. 450, 459-460 (1968) (\"free transfer\" plan). \n[4] The Court of Appeals also noted several specific instances of school district mergers ordered by the State Board of \nEducation for financial reasons. 484 F. 2d, at 247. Limitations on the authority of local school districts were also outlined by \nthe Court of Appeals: \n\"Local school districts, unless they have the approval of the State Board of Education or the Superintendent of Public \nInstruction, cannot consolidate with another school district, annex territory, divide or attach parts of other districts, borrow \nmonies in anticipation of State aid, or construct, reconstruct or remodel school buildings or additions to them.\" Id., at 249. \n(Footnotes and supporting statutory citations omitted.) \nAnd the Court of Appeals properly considered the State's statutory attempt to undo the adoption of a voluntary high school \ndesegregation plan by the Detroit Board of Education as evidencing state control over local school district \naffairs. Ibid. Finally, it is also relevant to note that the District Court found that the school district boundaries in that segment \nof the metropolitan area preliminarily designated as the desegregation area \"in general bear no relationship to other \nmunicipal, county, or special district governments, needs or services,\" that some educational services are already provided \nto students on an interdistrict basis requiring their travel from one district to another, and that local communities in the \nmetropolitan area share noneducational interests in common, which do not adhere to school district lines, and have applied \nmetropolitan solutions to other governmental needs. 345 F. Supp. 914, 934-935 (ED Mich. 1972). \n[5] These included the creation and alteration of attendance zones and feeder patterns from the elementary to the \nsecondary schools in a manner naturally and predictably perpetuating racial segregation of students, the transportation of \nNegro students beyond predominantly white schools with available space to predominantly Negro schools, the use of \noptional attendance areas in neighborhoods in which Negro families had recently begun to settle to permit white students to \ntransfer to predominantly white schools nearer the city limits, and the construction of schools in the heart of residentially \nsegregated areas, thereby maximizing school segregation. \n[1] Contrary to the Court's characterization, the use of racial ratios in this case in no way differed from that \nin Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1 (1971). Here, as there, mathematical ratios were used \nsimply as \"a starting point in the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id., at 25. It may be \nexpected that a final desegregation plan in this case would deviate from a pure mathematical approach. Indeed, the District \nCourt's most recent order appointing a panel of experts to draft an interdistrict plan requires only that the plan be designed \n\"to achieve the greatest degree of actual desegregation. . . [w]ithin the limitations of reasonable travel time and distance \nfactors.\" 345 F. Supp. 914, 918 (ED Mich. 1972). Cf. 402 U. S., at 23. \n[2] It does not appear that even the majority places any real weight on this consideration since it recognizes that interdistrict \nrelief would be proper where a constitutional violation within one district produces a significant segregative effect in another \ndistrict, see ante, at 744-745, thus allowing interdistrict relief to touch districts which have not themselves violated the \nConstitution. \n[3] See Mich. Comp. Laws § 388.851 (1970). \n[4] See § 388.1179. \n[5] See §§ 388.629 and 340.600. \n[6] See § 388.611. The State contributed an average of 34% of the operating budgets of the 54 school districts included in \nthe original proposed desegregation area. In 11 of these districts, state contributions exceeded 50% of the operating \nbudgets. \n\n[7] See, e. g., id., § 340.575. See also 1949-1950 Report of the Attorney General 104 (Roth); Vol. 1, 1955 Report of the \nAttorney General 561 (Kavanagh); 1961-1962 Report of the Attorney General 533 (Kelley). \n[8] See Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 211.34 and 340.681. \n[9] § 340.569. \n[10] §§ 257.811 (c), 340.361, 340.781, 340.782, 388.371. \n[11] § 340.575. \n[12] § 388.1171. \n[13] § 340.887 (1) \n[14] Op. Atty. Gen.

Laws §§ 340.461-340.468. \n[19] Despite MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S claim to the contrary, ante, at 756 n. 2, of his concurring opinion, the record fully \nsupports my statement that Negro students were intentionally confined to a core of Negro schools within the city of Detroit. \nSee, e. g., supra, at 784-785, 790-792. Indeed, MR. JUSTICE STEWART acknowledges that intentional acts of segregation \nby the State have separated white and Negro students within the city, and that the resulting core of all-Negro schools has \ngrown to encompass most of the city. In suggesting that my approval of an interdistrict remedy rests on a further conclusion \nthat the State or its political subdivisions have been responsible for the increasing percentage of Negro students in Detroit, \nmy Brother STEWART misconceives the thrust of this dissent. In light of the high concentration of Negro students in Detroit, \nthe District Judge's finding that a Detroit-only remedy cannot effectively cure the constitutional violation within the city should \nbe enough to support the choice of an interdistrict remedy. Whether state action is responsible for the growth of the core of \nall-Negro schools in Detroit is, in my view, quite irrelevant. \nThe difficulty with MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S position is that he, like the Court, confuses the inquiry required to determine \nwhether there has been a substantive constitutional violation with that necessary to formulate an appropriate remedy once a \nconstitutional violation has been shown. While a finding of state action is of course a prerequisite to finding a violation, we \nhave never held that after unconstitutional state action has been shown, the District Court at the remedial stage must \nengage in a second inquiry to determine whether additional state action exists to justify a particular remedy. Rather, once a \nconstitutional violation has been shown, the District Court is duty-bound to formulate an effective remedy and, in so doing, \nthe court is entitled—indeed, it is required—to consider all the factual circumstances relevant to the framing of an effective \ndecree. Thus, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education we held that the District Court must take into account \nthe existence of extensive residential segregation in determining whether a racially neutral \"neighborhood school\" \nattendance plan was an adequate desegregation remedy, regardless of whether this residential segregation was caused by \nstate action. So here, the District Court was required to consider the facts that the Detroit school system was already \npredominantly Negro and would likely become all-Negro upon issuance of a Detroit-only decree in framing an effective \ndesegregation remedy, regardless of state responsibility for this situation. \n[20] In fact, the District Court remarked \"that this court's task is to enforce constitutional rights not to act as a schoolmaster; \nthe court's task is to protect the constitutional rights here found violated with as little intrusion into the education process as \npossible. The court's objective is to establish the minimum constitutional framework within which the system of public \nschools may operate now and hereafter in a racially unified, non-discriminatory fashion. Within that framework the body \npolitic, educators, parents, and most particularly the children must be given the maximum opportunity to experiment and \nsecure a high quality, and equal, educational opportunity.\" Pet. App. 82a. \n[21] See, e. g., Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 340.69, 340.121 (d), 340.359, 340.582, 340.582a, 340.590. \n\n[22] See id., §§ 340.330-340.330u. \n ",

No. 35257. \nUnited States District Court, E. D. Michigan, S. D. \nAugust 8, 1980. \nLouis Lucas, Memphis, Tenn., Thomas Atkins, Boston, Mass., for plaintiffs. \nGeorge T. Roumell, Jr., Theodore Sachs, Detroit, Mich., Paul J. Zimmer, Asst. Atty. Gen., Lansing, \nMich., for defendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nDeMASCIO, District Judge. \nOn June 30, 1980, the Clerk of the Court for the Eastern District of Michigan delivered to this court a \ncopy of the court of appeals' mandate issued on May 30, 1980.[1] The chief judge has voiced his \nconcern that, although the court of appeals' opinion suggested reassignment, the mandate does not \nrequire him to \"reassign this case either to himself or to another appropriate judge.\" In its opinion, the \ncourt stated that, in view of \"the challenge raised by the plaintiffs, and the bitter feelings that have \ndeveloped,\" I should no longer preside in this case. \nWhile I prefer to preside in this case until it is concluded, I find that I do not have that choice. There \nis precedent for the court's sua sponte direction that on remand this case be reassigned to a \ndifferent judge.[2] In re Schulman, No. 79-3183 (6th Cir. May 4, 1979) (unpublished);[3] United States \nv. Carabbia, 512 F.2d 34 (6th Cir. 1975); Pingatore v. Montgomery Ward and Co., Inc., No. 72-1324 \n(6th Cir. April 11, 1973) (unpublished). In one instance the court considered and decided against a \nreassignment on remand, Drayton v. Jiffee Chemical Corp., 591 F.2d 352, 361-62 (6th Cir. \n1978), and on another occasion suggested to a party that, if the trial court did not reassign the case \nto a different judge, the party could apply to the court of appeals for 218*218 an order of \nreassignment, Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. v. Lorain Journal Co., 358 F.2d 790, 794 (6th Cir. \n1966). It is not significant that reassignment is not ordered in the mandate, or comes as a suggestion \nin an appellate opinion. In United States v. Yagid, 528 F.2d 962, 965 (2d Cir. 1976), the court \nbelieved that: \n[s]uch suggestions contained in appellate opinions should not be deemed merely precatory because \nthey are not \"ordered\" . . ..[4] \n\n(Emphasis added.) \nOther circuits have on occasion ordered reassignment on remand. When its previous suggestion \nthat a case be reassigned was not followed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded \nthat it could order reassignment of a case pursuant to the all-writs statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, or \nalternatively, pursuant to its \"inherent powers of appellate jurisdiction to effectuate what seems . . . to \nbe the manifest ends of justice.\" United States v. Ritter, 273 F.2d 30 (10th Cir. 1959), cert. \ndenied 362 U.S. 950, 80 S.Ct. 863, 4 L.Ed.2d 869 (1960). However, in granting the government's \nextraordinary request, the tenth circuit made it clear that it was doing so because it doubted Judge \nRitter's impartiality.[5] In still another case, although \"the proceedings were acrimonious at times and \nevidenced the existence of some feelings between the court and counsel,\" the tenth circuit held that \nthe district judge did not err in refusing to disqualify himself. Calvaresi v. United States, 216 F.2d \n891, 900 (10th Cir. 1954). But, the Supreme Court, in a one-sentence per curiam grant of certiorari, \nstated: \nIn the interests of justice and in the exercise of the supervisory powers of the Court, certiorari is \ngranted and the cases are severally reversed and remanded to the District Court for retrial before a \ndifferent judge. \n348 U.S. 961, 75 S.Ct. 522, 99 L.Ed. 749 (1955). \nThe Supreme Court's summary reassignment in Calvaresi is cited as authority for ordering \nreassignment on remand in Naples v. United States, 307 F.2d 618, 631 (D.C.Cir. 1962); and Blunt v. \nUnited States, 244 F.2d 355, 368 (D.C.Cir.1957). In United States v. Columbia Broadcasting \nSystem, Inc., 497 F.2d 107, 109-110 (5th Cir. 1974), the court relied upon its supervisory powers in \ndirecting that retrial be held before a different judge. \nAlthough a reason for ordering reassignment is generally stated in the opinion, the various circuits \ndo not agree on their authority for ordering reassignment on remand. Some circuits have not cited \nany authority for doing so. In re Schulman, No. 79-3183 (6th Cir. May 4, 1979) (unpublished) \n(personal animosity between trial judge and respondent; no authority for reassignment stated; \nanalogy drawn to Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(b)); United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8 (2d Cir. 1977) (original \ntrial judge might have difficulty disregarding erroneously received evidence; reassignment ordered \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2106); United States v. Yagid, 528 F.2d 962 (2d Cir. 1976) (original trial \njudge might be required to testify on remand; reassignment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2106); United \nStates v. Carabbia, 512 F.2d 34 (6th Cir. 1975) (statements 219*219 made by trial judge were at \nissue in question of whether plea should be set aside; no authority for reassignment stated); United \nStates v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 497 F.2d 107 (5th Cir. 1974) (trial judge's own \nconduct was at issue; reassignment ordered pursuant to court's supervisory powers); Pingatore v. \nMontgomery Ward and Co., Inc.,No. 72-1324 (6th Cir. April 11, 1973) (unpublished) (trial judge \nreversed twice; third trial to be before a different judge; no authority for reassignment stated); Salley \nv. United States, 353 F.2d 897 (D.C.Cir.1965) (judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned; \nciting Naples); Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, 810-11 (9th Cir. 1963) (trial \njudge abused his discretion by reversing ruling of another district judge; reassignment pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2106); Naples v. United States, 307 F.2d 618 (D.C. Cir.1962) (court was critical of trial \njudge's conduct; citing Calvaresi and Blunt);[6] United States v. Ritter, 273 F.2d 30 (10th Cir. \n1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 950, 80 S.Ct. 863, 4 L.Ed.2d 869 (1960) (trial judge's impartiality might \nreasonably be questioned; reassignment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651 and the court's inherent \npowers of appellate jurisdiction); Blunt v. United States, 244 F.2d 355, 368 (D.C.Cir.1957)(judge's \nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned; citing Calvaresi).[7] \n\nEven though the reasoning in the preceding cases appears somewhat inconsistent or conclusory, I \nam persuaded that the court of appeals can effect the reassignment suggested in this case. \nMoreover, that reassignment is effective as of April 14, 1980, the date of the court's opinion, and I \ncannot decide the issues still pending before this court as a result of hearings conducted late last \nfall. As indicated, the court of appeals suggested that the chief judge of this court reassign this case \nto himself or to another appropriate judge. But a local court rule provides that all cases are to be \nassigned by blind draw. Rule IV(c), Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. I believe that the court of appeals' suggestion that this case be assigned to \nanother appropriate judge means a judge assigned pursuant to the local court rule. \nIn view of the perception voiced by the court of appeals concerning \"bitter feelings that have \ndeveloped,\" I add this brief comment. Plaintiffs' counsel has never hinted here that I have displayed \nsuch an animus, an animus which, in my view, would have compelled me to grant plaintiffs' recusal \nmotion.[8] I took extreme care to determine whether I could preside impartially in this case, even \nraising issues not contained in plaintiffs' recusal motion. Bradley v. Milliken, 426 F.Supp. 929, 940 \n(E.D.Mich.1976). I decided that I could, and the court of appeals agreed. \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Clerk of the Court reassign this case pursuant to the rules of \ncourt providing for assignment of cases. \n[1] Apparently, the original mandate was not received in this court. We are informed that the Clerk of the Court requested a \ncopy, which he received on June 30, 1980. \n[2] The precedent that I refer to concerns only cases where reassignment was not compelled by a clear rule of law, such as \nthe requirement of disqualification for relationships specified in 28 U.S.C. § 455(b) or for trial of criminal contempt involving \ndisrespect to or criticism of a judge, Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(b). \n[3] Although I am aware that the sixth circuit does not consider its unpublished opinions to have precedential value, Rule 11, \nRules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, I cite them here only because they illustrate the sixth \ncircuit's view of its authority to reassign cases on remand. \n[4] Apparently, the court in Yagid, having previously said that another judge \"should preside over the new trial,\" was \nimpatient with the district court's reluctance to reassign the case. The court pointedly said: \n[W]e emphatically reject the district court's notion that \"[s]uch a provision in an appellate opinion . . . does not, nor should \nit, effect, without more, an automatic reassignment of the case.\" (Emphasis in original.) \n[5] This case was decided before the 1974 amendment to 28 U.S.C. § 455, which broadened the grounds for \ndisqualification, requiring a judge to disqualify himself or herself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably \nbe questioned.\" Thus, the court's action under 28 U.S.C. § 1651 or its \"inherent powers of appellate jurisdiction\" would now \nbe specifically sanctioned under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). See, e. g., United States v. Ritter,540 F.2d 459, 464 (10th Cir. \n1976), where United States v. Ritter, 273 F.2d 30 (10th Cir. 1959), was discussed and Judge Ritter was disqualified under \n28 U.S.C. § 455(a). \n[6] Two judges dissented from the en banc decision in Naples considering the reassignment order \"a reflection on a \ndistinguished member of the district court whose ability and integrity are well known.\" In addition, Judge (now Justice) \nBurger saw no reason to reassign the case. \n[7] Only in Calvaresi, 348 U.S. 961, 75 S.Ct. 522, 99 L.Ed. 749 (1955), was there a reassignment without a discernible \nreason. \n[8] In In re Schulman, No. 79-3183 (6th Cir. May 4, 1979), the court of appeals concluded that the trial judge should have \nrecused himself and referred the matter for disposition to another judge because \"it is evident from the record that marked \npersonal feelings were present on both sides, and it appears that Schulman's conduct left personal stings, however \njustified.\" (Emphasis added.) \n\n ",

Drachler, the Governor, Attorney General, State Board of Education and \nState Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Michigan. In their complaint, plaintiffs \n\nattacked a statute of the State of Michigan known as Act 48 of the 1970 Legislature on the ground \nthat it put the State of Michigan in the position of unconstitutionally interfering with the execution and \noperation of a voluntary plan of partial high school desegregation (known as the April 7, 1970 Plan) \nwhich had been adopted by the Detroit Board of Education to be effective beginning with the fall \n1970 semester. Plaintiffs also alleged that the Detroit Public School System was and is segregated \non the basis of race as a result of the official policies and actions of the defendants and their \npredecessors in office. \nAdditional parties have intervened in the litigation since it was commenced. The Detroit Federation \nof Teachers (DFT) which represents a majority of Detroit Public school teachers in collective \nbargaining negotiations with the defendant Board of Education, has intervened as a defendant, and \na group of parents has intervened as defendants. \nInitially the matter was tried on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement \nof Act 48 so as to permit the April 7 Plan to be implemented. On that issue, this Court ruled that \nplaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction since there had been no proof that Detroit has a \nsegregated school system. The Court of Appeals found that the \"implementation of the April 7 Plan \nwas thwarted by State action in the form of the Act of the Legislature of Michigan,\" (433 F.2d 897, \n902), and that such action could not be interposed to delay, obstruct or nullify steps lawfully taken for \nthe purpose of protecting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe plaintiffs then sought to have this Court direct the defendant Detroit Board to implement the April \n7 Plan by the start of the second semester (February, 1971) in order to remedy the deprivation of \nconstitutional rights wrought by the unconstitutional statute. In response to an order of the Court, \ndefendant Board suggested two other plans, along with the April 7 Plan, and noted priorities, with top \npriority assigned to the so-called \"Magnet Plan.\" The Court acceded to the wishes of the Board and \napproved the Magnet Plan. Again, plaintiffs appealed but the appellate court refused to pass on the \nmerits of the plan. Instead, the case was remanded with instructions to proceed immediately to a trial \non the merits of plaintiffs' substantive allegations about the Detroit School System. 438 F.2d 945 (6th \nCir. 1971). \nTrial, limited to the issue of segregation, began April 6, 1971 and concluded on July 22, 1971, \nconsuming 41 trial days, interspersed by several brief recesses necessitated by other demands \nupon the time of Court and counsel. Plaintiffs introduced substantial evidence in support of their \ncontentions, including expert and factual testimony, demonstrative exhibits and school board \ndocuments. At the close of plaintiffs' case, in chief, 585*585 the Court ruled that they had presented \na prima facie case of state imposed segregation in the Detroit Public Schools; accordingly, the Court \nenjoined (with certain exceptions) all further school construction in Detroit pending the outcome of \nthe litigation. \nThe State defendants urged motions to dismiss as to them. These were denied by the Court. \nAt the close of proofs intervening parent defendants (Denise Magdowski, et al.) filed a motion to join, \nas parties 85 contiguous \"suburban\" school districts — all within the so-called Larger Detroit \nMetropolitan area. This motion was taken under advisement pending the determination of the issue \nof segregation. \nIt should be noted that, in accordance with earlier rulings of the Court, proofs submitted at previous \nhearings in the cause, were to be and are considered as part of the proofs of the hearing on the \nmerits. \n\nIn considering the present racial complexion of the City of Detroit and its public school system we \nmust first look to the past and view in perspective what has happened in the last half century. In \n1920 Detroit was a predominantly white city — 91% — and its population younger than in more \nrecent times. By the year 1960 the largest segment of the city's white population was in the age \nrange of 35 to 50 years, while its black population was younger and of childbearing age. The \npopulation of 0-15 years of age constituted 30% of the total population of which 60% were white and \n40% were black. In 1970 the white population was principally aging — 45 years — while the black \npopulation was younger and of childbearing age. Childbearing blacks equaled or exceeded the total \nwhite population. As older white families without children of school age leave the city they are \nreplaced by younger black families with school age children, resulting in a doubling of enrollment in \nthe local neighborhood school and a complete change in student population from white to black. As \nblack inner city residents move out of the core city they \"leap-frog\" the residential areas nearest their \nformer homes and move to areas recently occupied by whites. \nThe population of the City of Detroit reached its highest point in 1950 and has been declining by \napproximately 169,500 per decade since then. In 1950, the city population constituted 61% of the \ntotal population of the standard metropolitan area and in 1970 it was but 36% of the metropolitan \narea population. The suburban population has increased by 1,978,000 since 1940. There has been \na steady out-migration of the Detroit population since 1940. Detroit today is principally a \nconglomerate of poor black and white plus the aged. Of the aged, 80% are white. \nIf the population trends evidenced in the federal decennial census for the years 1940 through 1970 \ncontinue, the total black population in the City of Detroit in 1980 will be approximately 840,000, or \n53.6% of the total. The total population of the city in 1970 is 1,511,000 and, if past trends continue, \nwill be 1,338,000 in 1980. In school year 1960-61, there were 285,512 students in the Detroit Public \nSchools of which 130,765 were black. In school year 1966-67, there were 297,035 students, of \nwhich 168,299 were black. In school year 1970-71 there were 289,743 students of which 184,194 \nwere black. The percentage of black students in the Detroit Public Schools in 1975-76 will be 72.0%, \nin 1980-81 will be 80.7% and in 1992 it will be virtually 100% if the present trends continue. In 1960, \nthe non-white population, ages 0 years to 19 years, was as follows: \n 0 -  4 years      42% \n 5 -  9 years      36% \n10 - 14 years      28% \n15 - 19 years      18% \nIn 1970 the non-white population, ages 0 years to 19 years, was as follows: \n 0 -  4 years      48% \n 5 -  9 years      50% \n10 - 14 years      50% \n15 - 19 years      40% \n586*586 The black population as a percentage of the total population in the City of Detroit was: \n(a)   1900                           1.4% \n(b)   1910                           1.2% \n(c)   1920                           4.1% \n(d)   1930                           7.7% \n(e)   1940                           9.2% \n(f)   1950                          16.2% \n(g)   1960                          28.9% \n(h)   1970                          43.9% \n\nThe black population as a percentage of total student population of the Detroit Public Schools was \nas follows: \n(a)   1961                          45.8% \n(b)   1963                          51.3% \n(c)   1964                          53.0% \n(d)   1965                          54.8% \n(e)   1966                          56.7% \n(f)   1967                          58.2% \n(g)   1968                          59.4% \n(h)   1969                          61.5% \n(i)   1970                          63.8% \nFor the years indicated the housing characteristics in the City of Detroit were as follows: \n(a)   1960       total supply of housing \n                 units was 553,000 \n \n(b)   1970       total supply of housing \n                 units was 530,770 \nThe percentage decline in the white students in the Detroit Public Schools during the period 1961-\n1970 (53.6% in 1960; 34.8% in 1970) has been greater than the percentage decline in the white \npopulation in the City of Detroit during the same period (70.8% in 1960; 55.21% in 1970), and \ncorrelatively, the percentage increase in black students in the Detroit Public Schools during the nine-\nyear period 1961-1970 (45.8% in 1961; 63.8% in 1970) has been greater than the percentage \nincrease in the black population of the City of Detroit during the ten-year period 1960-1970 (28.9% in \n1960; 43.9% in 1970). In 1961 there were eight schools in the system without white pupils and 73 \nschools with no Negro pupils. In 1970 there were 30 schools with no white pupils and 11 schools \nwith no Negro pupils, an increase in the number of schools without white pupils of 22 and a \ndecrease in the number of schools without Negro pupils of 62 in this ten-year period. Between 1968 \nand 1970 Detroit experienced the largest increase in percentage of black students in the student \npopulation of any major northern school district. The percentage increase in Detroit was 4.7% as \ncontrasted with — \nNew York                            2.0% \nLos Angeles                         1.5% \nChicago                             1.9% \nPhiladelphia                        1.7% \nCleveland                           1.7% \nMilwaukee                           2.6% \nSt. Louis                           2.6% \nColumbus                            1.4% \nIndianapolis                        2.6% \nDenver                              1.1% \nBoston                              3.2% \nSan Francisco                       1.5% \nSeattle                             2.4% \nIn 1960, there were 266 schools in the Detroit School System. In 1970, there were 319 schools in \nthe Detroit School System. \n\nIn the Western, Northwestern, Northern, Murray, Northeastern, Kettering, King and Southeastern \nhigh school service areas, the following conditions exist at a level significantly higher than the city \naverage: \n(a) Poverty in children \n(b) Family income below poverty level \n(c) Rate of homicides per population \n(d) Number of households headed by females \n(e) Infant mortality rate \n(f) Surviving infants with neurological defects \n(g) Tuberculosis cases per 1,000 population \n(h) High pupil turnover in schools \nThe City of Detroit is a community generally divided by racial lines. Residential segregation within \nthe city 587*587 and throughout the larger metropolitan area is substantial, pervasive and of long \nstanding. Black citizens are located in separate and distinct areas within the city and are not \ngenerally to be found in the suburbs. While the racially unrestricted choice of black persons and \neconomic factors may have played some part in the development of this pattern of residential \nsegregation, it is, in the main, the result of past and present practices and customs of racial \ndiscrimination, both public and private, which have and do restrict the housing opportunities of black \npeople. On the record there can be no other finding. \nGovernmental actions and inaction at all levels, federal, state and local, have combined, with those \nof private organizations, such as loaning institutions and real estate associations and brokerage \nfirms, to establish and to maintain the pattern of residential segregation throughout the Detroit \nmetropolitan area. It is no answer to say that restricted practices grew gradually (as the black \npopulation in the area increased between 1920 and 1970), or that since 1948 racial restrictions on \nthe ownership of real property have been removed. The policies pursued by both government and \nprivate persons and agencies have a continuing and present effect upon the complexion of the \ncommunity — as we know, the choice of a residence is a relatively infrequent affair. For many years \nFHA and VA openly advised and advocated the maintenance of \"harmonious\" neighborhoods, i. \ne., racially and economically harmonious. The conditions created continue. While it would be unfair \nto charge the present defendants with what other governmental officers or agencies have done, it \ncan be said that the actions or the failure to act by the responsible school authorities, both city and \nstate, were linked to that of these other governmental units. When we speak of governmental action \nwe should not view the different agencies as a collection of unrelated units. Perhaps the most that \ncan be said is that all of them, including the school authorities, are, in part, responsible for the \nsegregated condition which exists. And we note that just as there is an interaction between \nresidential patterns and the racial composition of the schools, so there is a corresponding effect on \nthe residential pattern by the racial composition of the schools. \nTurning now to the specific and pertinent (for our purposes) history of the Detroit school system so \nfar as it involves both the local school authorities and the state school authorities, we find the \nfollowing: \nDuring the decade beginning in 1950 the Board created and maintained optional attendance zones \nin neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high school attendance areas of opposite \npredominant racial compositions. In 1959 there were eight basic optional attendance areas affecting \n21 schools. Optional attendance areas provided pupils living within certain elementary areas a \nchoice of attendance at one of two high schools. In addition there was at least one optional area \neither created or existing in 1960 between two junior high schools of opposite predominant racial \ncomponents. All of the high school optional areas, except two, were in neighborhoods undergoing \n\nracial transition (from white to black) during the 1950s. The two exceptions were: (1) the option \nbetween Southwestern (61.6% black in 1960) and Western (15.3% black); (2) the option between \nDenby (0% black) and Southeastern (30.9% black). With the exception of the Denby-Southeastern \noption (just noted) all of the options were between high schools of opposite predominant racial \ncompositions. The Southwestern-Western and Denby-Southeastern optional areas are all white on \nthe 1950, 1960 and 1970 census maps. Both Southwestern and Southeastern, however, had \nsubstantial white pupil populations, and the option allowed whites to escape integration. The natural, \nprobable, foreseeable and actual effect of these optional zones was to allow white youngsters to \nescape identifiably \"black\" schools. There had also been an optional zone (eliminated between \n1956 588*588 and 1959) created in \"an attempt . . to separate Jews and Gentiles within the system,\" \nthe effect of which was that Jewish youngsters went to Mumford High School and Gentile youngsters \nwent to Cooley. Although many of these optional areas had served their purpose by 1960 due to the \nfact that most of the areas had become predominantly black, one optional area (Southwestern-\nWestern affecting Wilson Junior High graduates) continued until the present school year (and will \ncontinue to effect 11th and 12th grade white youngsters who elected to escape from predominantly \nblack Southwestern to predominantly white Western High School). Mr. Henrickson, the Board's \ngeneral fact witness, who was employed in 1959 to, inter alia,eliminate optional areas, noted in 1967 \nthat: \"In operation Western appears to be still the school to which white students escape from \npredominantly Negro surrounding schools.\" The effect of eliminating this optional area (which \naffected only 10th graders for the 1970-71 school year) was to decrease Southwestern from 86.7% \nblack in 1969 to 74.3% black in 1970. \nThe Board, in the operation of its transportation to relieve overcrowding policy, has admittedly bused \nblack pupils past or away from closer white schools with available space to black schools. This \npractice has continued in several instances in recent years despite the Board's avowed policy, \nadopted in 1967, to utilize transportation to increase integration. \nWith one exception (necessitated by the burning of a white school), defendant Board has never \nbused white children to predominantly black schools. The Board has not bused white pupils to black \nschools despite the enormous amount of space available in inner-city schools. There were 22,961 \nvacant seats in schools 90% or more black. \nThe Board has created and altered attendance zones, maintained and altered grade structures and \ncreated and altered feeder school patterns in a manner which has had the natural, probable and \nactual effect of continuing black and white pupils in racially segregated schools. The Board admits at \nleast one instance where it purposefully and intentionally built and maintained a school and its \nattendance zone to contain black students. Throughout the last decade (and presently) school \nattendance zones of opposite racial compositions have been separated by north-south boundary \nlines, despite the Board's awareness (since at least 1962) that drawing boundary lines in an east-\nwest direction would result in significant integration. The natural and actual effect of these acts and \nfailures to act has been the creation and perpetuation of school segregation. There has never been \na feeder pattern or zoning change which placed a predominantly white residential area into a \npredominantly black school zone or feeder pattern. Every school which was 90% or more black in \n1960, and which is still in use today, remains 90% or more black. Whereas 65.8% of Detroit's black \nstudents attended 90% or more black schools in 1960, 74.9% of the black students attended 90% or \nmore black schools during the 1970-71 school year. \nThe public schools operated by defendant Board are thus segregated on a racial basis. This racial \nsegregation is in part the result of the discriminatory acts and omissions of defendant Board. \nIn 1966 the defendant State Board of Education and Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a \nJoint Policy Statement on Equality of Educational Opportunity, requiring that \n\n\"Local school boards must consider the factor of racial balance along with other educational \nconsiderations in making decisions about selection of new school sites, expansion of present \nfacilities. . . . Each of these situations presents an opportunity for integration.\" \nDefendant State Board's \"School Plant Planning Handbook\" requires that \n\"Care in site locations must be taken if a serious transportation problem exists or if housing patterns \nin an area would result in a school largely segregated on racial, ethnic, or socio-economic \nlines.\" 589*589 The defendant City Board has paid little heed to these statements and guidelines. \nThe State defendants have similarly failed to take any action to effectuate these policies. Exhibit NN \nreflects construction (new or additional) at 14 schools which opened for use in 1970-71; of these 14 \nschools, 11 opened over 90% black and one opened less than 10% black. School construction \ncosting $9,222,000 is opening at Northwestern High School which is 99.9% black, and new \nconstruction opens at Brooks Junior High, which is 1.5% black, at a cost of $2,500,000. The \nconstruction at Brooks Junior High plays a dual segregatory role: not only is the construction \nsegregated, it will result in a feeder pattern change which will remove the last majority white school \nfrom the already almost all-black Mackenzie High School attendance area. \nSince 1959 the Board has constructed at least 13 small primary schools with capacities of from 300 \nto 400 pupils. This practice negates opportunities to integrate, \"contains\" the black population and \nperpetuates and compounds school segregation. \nThe State and its agencies, in addition to their general responsibility for and supervision of public \neducation, have acted directly to control and maintain the pattern of segregation in the Detroit \nschools. The State refused, until this session of the legislature, to provide authorization or funds for \nthe transportation of pupils within Detroit regardless of their poverty or distance from the school to \nwhich they were assigned, while providing in many neighboring, mostly white, suburban districts the \nfull range of state supported transportation. This and other financial limitations, such as those on \nbonding and the working of the state aid formula whereby suburban districts were able to make far \nlarger per pupil expenditures despite less tax effort, have created and perpetuated systematic \neducational inequalities. \nThe State, exercising what Michigan courts have held to be is \"plenary power\" which includes power \n\"to use a statutory scheme, to create, alter, reorganize or even dissolve a school district, despite any \ndesire of the school district, its board, or the inhabitants thereof,\" acted to reorganize the school \ndistrict of the City of Detroit. \nThe State acted through Act 48 to impede, delay and minimize racial integration in Detroit schools. \nThe first sentence of Sec. 12 of the Act was directly related to the April 7, 1970 desegregation plan. \nThe remainder of the section sought to prescribe for each school in the eight districts criterion of \n\"free choice\" (open enrollment) and \"neighborhood schools\" (\"nearest school priority acceptance\"), \nwhich had as their purpose and effect the maintenance of segregation. \nIn view of our findings of fact already noted we think it unnecessary to parse in detail the activities of \nthe local board and the state authorities in the area of school construction and the furnishing of \nschool facilities. It is our conclusion that these activities were in keeping, generally, with the \ndiscriminatory practices which advanced or perpetuated racial segregation in these schools. \nIt would be unfair for us not to recognize the many fine steps the Board has taken to advance the \ncause of quality education for all in terms of racial integration and human relations. The most \nobvious of these is in the field of faculty integration. \n\nPlaintiffs urge the Court to consider allegedly discriminatory practices of the Board with respect to \nthe hiring, assignment and transfer of teachers and school administrators during a period reaching \nback more than 15 years. The short answer to that must be that black teachers and school \nadministrative personnel were not readily available in that period. The Board and the intervening \ndefendant union have followed a most advanced and exemplary course in adopting and carrying out \nwhat is called the \"balanced staff concept\" — which seeks to balance faculties in each school with \nrespect to race, sex and experience, with primary 590*590 emphasis on race. More particularly, we \nfind: \n1. With the exception of affirmative policies designed to achieve racial balance in instructional staff, \nno teacher in the Detroit Public Schools is hired, promoted or assigned to any school by reason of \nhis race. \n2. In 1956, the Detroit Board of Education adopted the rules and regulations of the Fair Employment \nPractices Act as its hiring and promotion policy and has adhered to this policy to date. \n3. The Board has actively and affirmatively sought out and hired minority employees, particularly \nteachers and administrators, during the past decade. \n4. Between 1960 and 1970, the Detroit Board of Education has increased black representation \namong its teachers from 23.3% to 42.1%, and among its administrators from 4.5% to 37.8%. \n5. Detroit has a higher proportion of black administrators than any other city in the country. \n6. Detroit ranked second to Cleveland in 1968 among the 20 largest northern city school districts in \nthe percentage of blacks among the teaching faculty and in 1970 surpassed Cleveland by several \npercentage points. \n7. The Detroit Board of Education currently employs black teachers in a greater percentage than the \npercentage of adult black persons in the City of Detroit. \n8. Since 1967, more blacks than whites have been placed in high administrative posts with the \nDetroit Board of Education. \n9. The allegation that the Board assigns black teachers to black schools is not supported by the \nrecord. \n10. Teacher transfers are not granted in the Detroit Public Schools unless they conform with the \nbalanced staff concept. \n11. Between 1960 and 1970, the Detroit Board of Education reduced the percentage of schools \nwithout black faculty from 36.3% to 1.2%, and of the four schools currently without black faculty, \nthree are specialized trade schools where minority faculty cannot easily be secured. \n12. In 1968, of the 20 largest northern city school districts, Detroit ranked fourth in the percentage of \nschools having one or more black teachers and third in the percentage of schools having three or \nmore black teachers. \n13. In 1970, the Board held open 240 positions in schools with less than 25% black, rejecting white \napplicants for these positions until qualified black applicants could be found and assigned. \n\n14. In recent years, the Board has come under pressure from large segments of the black \ncommunity to assign male black administrators to predominantly black schools to serve as male role \nmodels for students, but such assignments have been made only where consistent with the \nbalanced staff concept. \n15. The numbers and percentages of black teachers in Detroit increased from 2,275 and 21.6%, \nrespectively, in February, 1961, to 5,106 and 41.6%, respectively, in October, 1970. \n16. The number of schools by percent black of staffs changed from October, 1963 to October, 1970 \nas follows: \nNumber of schools without black teachers — decreased from 41, to 4. \nNumber of schools with more than 0%, but less than 10% black teachers — decreased from 58, to 8. \nTotal number of schools with less than 10% black teachers — decreased from 99, to 12. \nNumber of schools with 50% or more black teachers — increased from 72, to 124. \n17. The number of schools by percent black of staffs changed from October, 1969 to October, 1970, \nas follows: \nNumber of schools without black teachers — decreased from 6, to 4. \nNumber of schools with more than 0%, but less than 10% black teachers — decreased from 41, to 8. \n591*591 Total number of schools with less than 10% black teachers — decreased from 47, to 12. \nNumber of schools with 50% or more black teachers — increased from 120, to 124. \n18. The total number of transfers necessary to achieve a faculty racial quota in each school \ncorresponding to the system-wide ratio, and ignoring all other elements is, as of 1970, 1,826. \n19. If account is taken of other elements necessary to assure quality integrated education, including \nqualifications to teach the subject area and grade level, balance of experience, and balance of sex, \nand further account is taken of the uneven distribution of black teachers by subject taught and sex, \nthe total number of transfers which would be necessary to achieve a faculty racial quota in each \nschool corresponding to the system-wide ratio, if attainable at all, would be infinitely greater. \n20. Balancing of staff by qualifications for subject and grade level, then by race, experience and sex, \nis educationally desirable and important. \n21. It is important for students to have a successful role model, especially black students in certain \nschools, and at certain grade levels. \n22. A quota of racial balance for faculty in each school which is equivalent to the system-wide ratio \nand without more is educationally undesirable and arbitrary. \n23. A severe teacher shortage in the 1950s and 1960s impeded integration-of-faculty opportunities. \n24. Disadvantageous teaching conditions in Detroit in the 1960s — salaries, pupil mobility and \ntransiency, class size, building conditions, distance from teacher residence, shortage of teacher \nsubstitutes, etc. — made teacher recruitment and placement difficult. \n25. The Board did not segregate faculty by race, but rather attempted to fill vacancies with certified \nand qualified teachers who would take offered assignments. \n\n26. Teacher seniority in the Detroit system, although measured by system-wide service, has been \napplied consistently to protect against involuntary transfers and \"bumping\" in given schools. \n27. Involuntary transfers of teachers have occurred only because of unsatisfactory ratings or \nbecause of decrease of teacher services in a school, and then only in accordance with balanced \nstaff concept. \n28. There is no evidence in the record that Detroit teacher seniority rights had other than equitable \npurpose or effect. \n29. Substantial racial integration of staff can be achieved, without disruption of seniority and stable \nteaching relationships, by application of the balanced staff concept to naturally occurring vacancies \nand increases and reductions of teacher services. \n30. The Detroit Board of Education has entered into successive collective bargaining contracts with \nthe Detroit Federation of Teachers, which contracts have included provisions promoting integration \nof staff and students. \nThe Detroit School Board has, in many other instances and in many other respects, undertaken to \nlessen the impact of the forces of segregation and attempted to advance the cause of integration. \nPerhaps the most obvious one was the adoption of the April 7 Plan. Among other things, it has \ndenied the use of its facilities to groups which practice racial discrimination; it does not permit the \nuse of its facilities for discriminatory apprentice training programs; it has opposed state legislation \nwhich would have the effect of segregating the district; it has worked to place black students in craft \npositions in industry and the building trades; it has brought about a substantial increase in the \npercentage of black students in manufacturing and construction trade apprenticeship classes; it \nbecame the first public agency in Michigan to adopt and implement a policy requiring affirmative act \nof contractors with which it deals to insure equal employment opportunities in their work forces; it \nhas been a leader in pioneering 592*592 the use of multi-ethnic instructional material, and in so \ndoing has had an impact on publishers specializing in producing school texts and instructional \nmaterials; and it has taken other noteworthy pioneering steps to advance relations between the \nwhite and black races. \nIn conclusion, however, we find that both the State of Michigan and the Detroit Board of Education \nhave committed acts which have been causal factors in the segregated condition of the public \nschools of the City of Detroit. As we assay the principles essential to a finding of de jure segregation, \nas outlined in rulings of the United States Supreme Court, they are: \n1. The State, through its officers and agencies, and usually, the school administration, must have \ntaken some action or actions with a purpose of segregation. \n2. This action or these actions must have created or aggravated segregation in the schools in \nquestion. \n3. A current condition of segregation exists. \nWe find these tests to have been met in this case. We recognize that causation in the case before us \nis both several and comparative. The principal causes undeniably have been population movement \nand housing patterns, but state and local governmental actions, including school board actions, have \nplayed a substantial role in promoting segregation. It is, the Court believes, unfortunate that we \ncannot deal with public school segregation on a no-fault basis, for if racial segregation in our public \nschools is an evil, then it should make no difference whether we classify it de jure or de facto. Our \n\nobjective, logically, it seems to us, should be to remedy a condition which we believe needs \ncorrection. In the most realistic sense, if fault or blame must be found it is that of the community as a \nwhole, including, of course, the black components. We need not minimize the effect of the actions of \nfederal, state and local governmental officers and agencies, and the actions of loaning institutions \nand real estate firms, in the establishment and maintenance of segregated residential patterns — \nwhich lead to school segregation — to observe that blacks, like ethnic groups in the past, have \ntended to separate from the larger group and associate together. The ghetto is at once both a place \nof confinement and a refuge. There is enough blame for everyone to share. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1. This Court has jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter of this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331(a), 1343 (3) and (4), 2201 and 2202; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, and 2000d. \n2. In considering the evidence and in applying legal standards it is not necessary that the Court find \nthat the policies and practices, which it has found to be discriminatory, have as their motivating \nforces any evil intent or motive. Keyes v. Sch. Dist. #1, Denver, D.C., 303 F.Supp. 279. Motive, ill will \nand bad faith have long ago been rejected as a requirement to invoke the protection of the \nFourteenth Amendment against racial discrimination. Sims v. Georgia, 389 U.S. 404, 407-408, 88 \nS.Ct. 523, 19 L.Ed.2d 634. \n3. School districts are accountable for the natural, probable and foreseeable consequences of their \npolicies and practices, and where racially identifiable schools are the result of such policies, the \nschool authorities bear the burden of showing that such policies are based on educationally \nrequired, non-racial considerations. Keyes v. Sch. Dist., supra, and Davis v. Sch. Dist. of Pontiac, \nD.C., 309 F.Supp. 734, and 6 Cir., 443 F.2d 573. \n4. In determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred, proof that a pattern of racially \nsegregated schools has existed for a considerable period of time amounts to a showing of racial \nclassification by the state and its agencies, which must be justified by clear and convincing \nevidence. State of Alabama v. United States, 5 Cir., 304 F. 2d 583. \n5. The Board's practice of shaping school attendance zones on a 593*593 north-south rather than an \neast-west orientation, with the result that zone boundaries conformed to racial residential dividing \nlines, violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Northcross v. Bd. of Ed. of Memphis, 6 Cir., 333 F.2d \n661. \n6. Pupil racial segregation in the Detroit Public School System and the residential racial segregation \nresulting primarily from public and private racial discrimination are interdependent phenomena. The \naffirmative obligation of the defendant Board has been and is to adopt and implement pupil \nassignment practices and policies that compensate for and avoid incorporation into the school \nsystem the effects of residential racial segregation. The Board's building upon housing segregation \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment. See, Davis v. Sch. Dist. of Pontiac, supra, and authorities there \nnoted. \n7. The Board's policy of selective optional attendance zones, to the extent that it facilitated the \nseparation of pupils on the basis of race, was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hobson v. \nHansen, D.C., 269 F.Supp. 401, aff'd sub nom., Smuck v. Hobson, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 408 F.2d \n175. \n\n8. The practice of the Board of transporting black students from over-crowded black schools to other \nidentifiably black schools, while passing closer identifiably white schools, which could have accepted \nthese pupils, amounted to an act of segregation by the school authorities. Spangler v. Pasadena City \nBd. of Ed., D.C., 311 F.Supp. 501. \n9. The manner in which the Board formulated and modified attendance zones for elementary schools \nhad the natural and predictable effect of perpetuating racial segregation of students. Such conduct is \nan act of de jure discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. United States v. School \nDistrict 151, D.C., 286 F.Supp. 786; Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, 4 Cir., 397 F.2d 37. \n10. A school board may not, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, maintain segregated \nelementary schools or permit educational choices to be influenced by community sentiment or the \nwishes of a majority of voters. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 12-13, 15-16, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d \n5. \n\"A citizen's constitutional rights can hardly be infringed simply because a majority of the people \nchoose that it be.\" Lucas v. 44th Gen'l Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 736-737, 84 S.Ct. 1459, \n1474, 12 L.Ed.2d 632. \n11. Under the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and laws of the State of \nMichigan, the responsibility for providing educational opportunity to all children on constitutional \nterms is ultimately that of the state. Turner v. Warren County Board of Education, D.C., 313 F.Supp. \n380; Art. VIII, §§ 1 and 2, Mich. Constitution; Daszkiewicz v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. of City of Detroit, 301 \nMich. 212, 3 N.W.2d 71. \n12. That a state's form of government may delegate the power of daily administration of public \nschools to officials with less than state-wide jurisdiction does not dispel the obligation of those who \nhave broader control to use the authority they have consistently with the constitution. In such \ninstances the constitutional obligation toward the individual school children is a shared one. Bradley \nv. Sch. Bd. of City of Richmond, D.C., 51 F.R.D. 139, 143. \n13. Leadership and general supervision over all public education is vested in the State Board of \nEducation. Art. VIII, § 3, Mich. Constitution of 1963. The duties of the State Board and \nsuperintendent include, but are not limited to, specifying the number of hours necessary to constitute \na school day; approval until 1962 of school sites; approval of school construction plans; accreditation \nof schools; approval of loans based on state aid funds; review of suspensions and expulsions of \nindividual students for misconduct [Op.Atty.Gen., July 7, 1970, No. 4705]; authority over \ntransportation routes and disbursement of transportation funds; teacher certification 594*594 and the \nlike. M.S.A. 15.1023(1), M.C.L.A. § 388.1001. State law provides review procedures from actions of \nlocal or intermediate districts (see M.S.A. 15.3442, M.C.L.A. § 340.442), with authority in the State \nBoard to ratify, reject, amend or modify the actions of these inferior state agencies. See M.S.A. \n15.3467; 15.1919(61); 15.1919 (68b); 15.2299(1); 15.1961, 15.3402, M.C.L.A. §§ 340.467, 388.621, \n388.628(a), 388.681, 388.851, 340.402; Bridgehampton School District No. 2 Fractional of \nCarsonville, Mich. v. Supt. of Public Instruction, 323 Mich. 615, 36 N.W.2d 166. In general, the state \nsuperintendent is given the duty \"[t]o do all things necessary to promote the welfare of the public \nschools and public educational instructions and provide proper educational facilities for the youth of \nthe state.\" M.S.A. 15.3252, M.C.L.A. § 340.252. See also M.S.A. 15.2299(57), M.C.L.A. § 388.717, \nproviding in certain instances for reorganization of school districts. \n14. State officials, including all of the defendants, are charged under the Michigan constitution with \nthe duty of providing pupils an education without discrimination with respect to race. Art. VIII, § 2, \nMich.Constitution of 1963. Art. I, § 2, of the constitution provides: \n\n\"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the \nenjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of \nreligion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate \nlegislation.\" \n15. The State Department of Education has recently established an Equal Educational Opportunities \nsection having responsibility to identify racially imbalanced school districts and develop \ndesegregation plans. M.S.A. 15.3355, M.C. L.A. § 340.355, provides that no school or department \nshall be kept for any person or persons on account of race or color. \n16. The state further provides special funds to local districts for compensatory education which are \nadministered on a per school basis under direct review of the State Board. All other state aid is \nsubject to fiscal review and accounting by the state. M.S.A. 15.1919. See also M.S.A. 15.1919(68b), \nproviding for special supplements to merged districts \"for the purpose of bringing about uniformity of \neducational opportunity for all the pupils of the district.\" The general consolidation law M.S.A. \n15.3401, M.C. L.A. § 340.401 authorizes annexation for even noncontiguous school districts upon \napproval of the superintendent of public instruction and electors, as provided by law. Op.Atty.Gen., \nFeb. 5, 1964, No. 4193. Consolidation with respect to so-called \"first class\" districts, i. e.,Detroit, is \ngenerally treated as an annexation with the first class district being the surviving entity. The law \nprovides procedures covering all necessary considerations. M.S.A. 15.3184, 15.3186, M.C.L.A. §§ \n340.184, 340.186. \n17. Where a pattern of violation of constitutional rights is established the affirmative obligation under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment is imposed on not only individual school districts, but upon the State \ndefendants in this case. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed. 2d 5; Griffin v. County \nSchool Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256; U. S. v. State \nof Georgia, Civ. No. 12972 (N.D. Ga., December 17, 1970), rev'd on other grounds, 5 Cir., 428 F.2d \n377; Godwin v. Johnston County Board of Education, D.C., 301 F.Supp. 1339; Lee v. Macon County \nBoard of Education, 267 F.Supp. 458 (M.D.Ala.), aff'd sub. nom., Wallace v. United States, 389 U.S. \n215, 88 S.Ct. 415, 19 L.Ed.2d 422; Franklin v. Quitman County Board of Education, D.C., 288 \nF.Supp. 509; Smith v. North Carolina State Board of Education, 444 F.2d 6 (4th Cir., 1971). \nThe foregoing constitutes our findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of segregation in \nthe public schools of the City of Detroit. \nHaving found a de jure segregated public school system in operation in the City of Detroit, our first \nstep, in considering what judicial remedial steps 595*595 must be taken, is the consideration of \nintervening parent defendants' motion to add as parties defendant a great number of Michigan \nschool districts located out county in Wayne County, and in Macomb and Oakland Counties, on the \nprincipal premise or ground that effective relief cannot be achieved or ordered in their absence. \nPlaintiffs have opposed the motion to join the additional school districts, arguing that the presence of \nthe State defendants is sufficient and all that is required, even if, in shaping a remedy, the affairs of \nthese other districts will be affected. \nIn considering the motion to add the listed school districts we pause to note that the proposed action \nhas to do with relief. Having determined that the circumstances of the case require judicial \nintervention and equitable relief, it would be improper for us to act on this motion until the other \nparties to the action have had an opportunity to submit their proposals for desegregation. \nAccordingly, we shall not rule on the motion to add parties at this time. Considered as a plan for \ndesegregation the motion is lacking in specificity and is framed in the broadest general terms. The \nmoving party may wish to amend its proposal and resubmit it as a comprehensive plan of \ndesegregation. \n\n[*] Mr. Bushnell was replaced 12-6-71 by George Roumell, Jr., and Louis D. Beer, Riley & Roumell, Detroit, Mich. A \nsubstitution of attorneys for the Detroit Board of Education was formally entered on that date. \n[1] The standing of the NAACP as a proper party plaintiff was not contested by the original defendants and the Court \nexpresses no opinion on the matter. \n ",

See 94 S.Ct. 538. \nPHILLIPS, Chief Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court, in which EDWARDS, CELEBREZZE, \nPECK, McCREE and LIVELY, Circuit Judges, joined. WEICK, Circuit Judge (pp. 259-274) and \nMILLER, Circuit Judge (pp. 283, 284) filed dissenting opinions and KENT, Circuit Judge (pp. 274-\n283) filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Circuit Judge KENT died May \n28, 1973 after the opinions were in the hands of the printer. \nPHILLIPS, Chief Judge. \nThis is a school desegregation case which, as originally filed, was directed against the school \nsystem of Detroit, Michigan, but on this appeal involves both Detroit and school districts located in \nthe surrounding metropolitan area. \nThe present appeal is the fourth time that the case has been before this court since the complaint \nwas filed August 18, 1970. The earlier decisions of this court are reported at Bradley v. Milliken, 433 \nF.2d 897 (6 Cir. 1970); Bradley v. Milliken, 438 F.2d 945 (6 Cir. 1971); and Bradley v. Milliken, 6 Cir., \n468 F.2d 902. cert. denied, 409 U.S. 844, 93 S.Ct. 45, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972). (On November 27, \n1972, the original panel dismissed for want of jurisdiction an \"emergency motion\" by the Detroit \nBoard of Education that State officials be required to provide funds to keep the Detroit public schools \noperating for 180 regular days of instruction during the current school year.) On February 27, 1973, \nthe Supreme Court denied review in Bloomfield Hills School District v. Roth, West Bloomfield School \nDistrict v. Roth, and Birmingham School District v. Roth, 410 U.S. 954, 93 S.Ct. 1418, 35 L.Ed. 2d \n687. In these cases this court had denied applications for writs of mandamus or prohibition against \nDistrict Judge Roth. The School Districts contended that the District Judge \nusurped 218*218 jurisdiction by failing to convene three-judge courts and by subjecting the Schools \nDistricts to his ruling and order in the school desegregation case in spite of the fact that the Districts \nwere not parties to the desegregation proceedings and had not been found to have committed any \nact of de jure segregation. The action of the Supreme Court was without prejudice to the right of the \nSchool Districts to file application to intervene in the present action.) \nOral arguments were heard before a panel of this court on August 24, 1972. An opinion was \nannounced by the panel on December 8, 1972, affirming two orders of the District Court, viz: (1) \nRuling on Issue of Segregation, reported at 338 F.Supp. 582, and (2) Findings of Fact and \nConclusions of Law on \"Detroit only\" plans of desegregation, dated March 28, 1972. The decision of \nthe panel vacated the remaining three orders on appeal (enumerated below), but affirmed in \nprinciple the ruling of the District Court on the propriety of a metropolitan remedy to accomplish \ndesegregation. \nOn January 16, 1973, this court granted rehearing in banc. Under the provisions of Rule 3(b) of the \nlocal rules of this court, the effect of granting rehearing in banc is \"to vacate the previous opinion and \njudgment of the court, to stay the mandate and to restore the case on the docket as a pending \nappeal.\" \n\nOral arguments before the court in banc were heard February 8, 1973. \nNo specific desegregation plan has been ordered by the District Court. The procedural history of the \nlitigation is set forth below. \nBefore this court at the present time are four interlocutory orders from which we have granted appeal \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) and one final order, viz: \n1. Ruling on Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, reported at 338 F.Supp. 582; \n2. Findings of fact and conclusions of law on \"Detroit only\" plans of desegregation, dated March 28, \n1972; \n3. Ruling on Propriety of a Metropolitan Remedy to Accomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools \nof the City of Detroit, dated March 24, 1972; \n4. Ruling on Desegregation Area and Development of Plan, and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of \nLaw in support thereof, dated June 14, 1972, 345 F. Supp. 914; and \n5. Order dated July 11, 1972, directing Michigan State officials to purchase 295 school buses (which \nthis court considers to be a final order). \nOn July 13, 1972, following oral argument, the original panel granted a motion for a temporary stay \nof the District Court's order of July 11, 1972, ordering the purchase of 295 school buses. \nOn July 17, 1972, following oral argument, the original panel directed that its stay order remain in \neffect until entry by the District Court of a final desegregation order or until certification by the District \nCourt of an appealable question as provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \nThereafter, on July 19, 1972, the District Court certified that the orders set forth above involve \ncontrolling questions of law, as provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), and made a determination of \nfinality under Rule 54(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. \nOn July 20, 1972, the original panel entered an order granting the interlocutory appeal concluding \nthat: \n\"[A]mong the substantial questions presented there is at least one difficult issue of first impression \nthat never has been decided by this court or the Supreme Court. In so holding we imply nothing as \nto our view of the merits of this appeal. We conclude that an immediate appeal may materially \nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" \nThe motion for leave to appeal was granted and the case was advanced for oral arguments on the \nmerits on August 24, 1972. \n219*219 The July 20, 1972 order of the original panel included the following stay order, which has \nremained in effect pending final disposition of the appeal on its merits: \n\"The motion for stay pending appeal having been considered, it is further ORDERED that the Order \nfor Acquisition of Transportation, entered by the District Court on July 11, 1972, and all orders of the \nDistrict Court concerned with pupil and faculty reassignment within the Metropolitan Area beyond the \ngeographical jurisdiction of the Detroit Board of Education, and all other proceedings in the District \n\nCourt other than planning proceedings, be stayed pending the hearing of this appeal on its merits \nand the disposition of the appeal by this court, or until further order of this court. This stay order does \nnot apply to the studies and planning of the panel which has been appointed by the District Court in \nits order of June 14, 1972, which panel was charged with the duty of preparing interim and final \nplans of desegregation.

We vacate this and the two remaining orders and remand to the District \nCourt for further proceedings as hereinafter set forth in detail in this opinion. \nI. CHRONOLOGY OF PROCEEDINGS \nOn April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan to effect a more balanced \ndistribution of black and white students in the senior high schools through enactment of changes in \nattendance zones involving some 12,000 pupils, to become effective over a three year period. Three \nmonths later this modest effort was thwarted by the legislature of the State of Michigan through \nenactment of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970. Section 12 of the Act delayed implementation of the \nplan. The four members of the Board who supported the April 7 plan were removed from office \nthrough a citizen initiated recall election. The new members of the Board and the incumbent \nmembers who had orginally opposed the April 7 plan thereafter rescinded it. \nThe complaint in this case was filed by individual black and white school children and their parents, \nand the Detroit branch of the NAACP against the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, its \nmembers, and the then Superintendent of Schools, as well as the Governor, the Attorney General, \nthe State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction of the 220*220 State \nof Michigan. (The State of Michigan as such is not a party to this litigation. References thereto \nshould be read as references to the public officials, State and local, through whom the State is \nalleged or shown to have acted.) \nThe complaint alleged that the Detroit public school system was and is segregated on the basis of \nrace as the result of actions and policies of the Board of Education and of the State of Michigan. The \ncomplaint specifically challenged the constitutionality of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 of the State \nof Michigan, which in effect repealed the April 7, 1970 high school desegregation plan formulated by \nthe Detroit Board. \n\nThe case was heard originally on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the \nenforcement of Act 48. In response to this motion the District Judge denied a preliminary injunction, \ndid not rule on the constitutionality of Act 48, but granted the motion of the Governor and Attorney \nGeneral of Michigan for dismissal of the cause as to them. On appeal this court held that § 12 of Act \n48 was an unconstitutional interference with the lawful protection of Fourteenth Amendment rights, \nthat there was no abuse of discretion in denying a preliminary injunction, and that the Governor and \nAttorney General should not have been dismissed as parties defendant at that stage of the \nproceeding. The case was remanded to the District Court for an expedited trial on the merits. 433 \nF.2d 897. \nOn remand plaintiffs moved for immediate implementation of the April 7 plan. On December 3, 1970, \nfollowing an evidentiary hearing on that plan and two updated plans, the District Court ordered \nimplementation of the \"Magnet\" or \"McDonald\" plan effective at the beginning of the next full school \nyear, pending ultimate disposition on the merits. Plaintiffs appealed and filed a motion for summary \nreversal. This court again held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to \nadopt the April 7 plan prior to an evidentiary hearing on the allegations of constitutional violations in \nthe complaint. We remanded the case with instructions to proceed to trial expeditiously on the merits \nof plaintiffs' allegations concerning the Detroit public school system. 438 F.2d 945. The trial of the \ncase on the issue of segregation began April 6, 1971, and continued until July 22, 1971, consuming \n41 trial days. On September 27, 1971, the District Court issued its ruling on the issue of segregation, \nholding that the Detroit public school system was racially segregated as a result of unconstitutional \npractices on the part of the defendant Detroit Board of Education and the Michigan State \ndefendants. 338 F. Supp. 582. \nA decision on a motion to join a large number of suburban school districts as parties defendant was \ndeferred on the ground that the motion was premature, in that no reasonably specific desegregation \nplan was before the court. The Detroit Board of Education was ordered to submit desegregation \nplans limited to the City, while State defendants were directed to submit plans encompassing the \nthree-county metropolitan area. An effort was made to appeal these orders to this court. On \nFebruary 23, 1972, this court held the orders to be non-appealable and dismissed the appeal. 468 \nF.2d 902,cert. denied, 409 U.S. 844, 93 S.Ct. 45, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972). \nAfter further proceedings concerning proposals for a Detroit only desegregation remedy and the \npresentation of three plans therefor, the District Judge on March 24, 1972, issued a ruling entitled \n\"Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy,\" and on March 28, 1972, he issued \n\"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit Only Plans of Desegregation.\" He rejected all \nDetroit only plans, saying in part: \"Relief of segregation in the public schools of the City of Detroit \ncannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city.\" \n221*221 Subsequently, the District Court issued an order on June 14, 1972, entitled \"Ruling on \nDesegregation Area and Order for Development of Plan for Desegregation.\" In this ruling and order \nthe District Court established tentative boundaries for a metropolitan remedy and provided for a \npanel of nine members to design plans for integration of the Detroit schools and those of 53 \nmetropolitan school districts within certain guidelines. 345 F.Supp. 914. \nThe panel recommended preparatory purchases of school buses prior to implementation of an \ninterim plan in September, 1972. Following a hearing, the District Court on July 11 ordered State \ndefendants to purchase or otherwise acquire 295 school buses. \nIn view of the intervening Congressional action by the enactment of the \"Broomfield Amendment,\" \ncertification was made to the Attorney General of the United States that the constitutionality of § 803 \nof the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, had been called into \n\nquestion. The Department of Justice intervened, filed a brief and participated in the oral arguments \nbefore this court. \nII. The Issues \nAll of the parties to this litigation in one form or another present three basic issues which we phrase \nas follows: \n1. Are the District Court's findings of fact pertaining to constitutional violations resulting in system-\nwide racial segregation of the Detroit Public Schools supported by substantial evidence or are they \nclearly erroneous? \n2. Based on the record in this case, can a constitutionally adequate system of desegregated schools \nbe established within the geographic limits of the Detroit school district? \n3. On this record does the District Judge's order requiring preparation of a metropolitan plan for \ncross-district assignment and transportation of school children throughout the Detroit metropolitan \narea represent a proper exercise of the equity power of the District Court? \nIII. The Constitutional Violations \n(A) Constitutional violations found to have been \ncommitted by the Detroit Board of Education: \n(1) Segregative zoning and assignment practices. \n(a) The District Judge found that the Detroit Board of Education formulated and modified attendance \nzones to create or perpetuate racial segregation. He also found that the feeder system for junior and \nsenior high schools was designed to maintain rather than eliminate black or white schools at the \nhigher levels. Its practice of shaping school attendance zones on a north-south rather than an east-\nwest orientation resulted in attendance zone boundaries conforming to racial dividing lines. \n(b) He further found that the Detroit Board of Education's policies involved a substantial number of \ninstances of transporting black children past white schools with available school space. \nHe also found that it was the policy of the Board of Education to create optional attendance areas \nwhich permitted white students to transfer to all white or predominately white schools located nearer \nthe city limits. \nThe District Judge also found that the policies of the Detroit Board of Education (and State Board of \nEducation) concerning school construction in some instances had the purpose of segregating \nstudents on a racial basis and in many others resulted in maintaining or increasing segregation. \n222*222 The District Judge's findings of fact pertaining to alteration of zones and feeder patterns are \nas follows: \n\"The Board has created and altered attendance zones, maintained and altered grade structures and \ncreated and altered feeder school patterns in a manner which has had the natural, probable and \nactual effect of continuing black and white pupils in racially segregated schools. The Board admits at \nleast one instance where it purposefully and intentionally built and maintained a school and its \nattendance zone to contain black students. Throughout the last decade (and presently) school \nattendance zones of opposite racial compositions have been separated by north-south boundary \nlines, despite the Board's awareness (since at least 1962) that drawing boundary lines in an east-\n\nwest direction would result in significant integration. The natural and actual effect of these acts and \nfailures to act has been the creation and perpetuation of school segregation. There has never been \na feeder pattern or zoning change which placed a predominantly white residential area into a \npredominately black school zone or feeder pattern. Every school which was 90% or more black in \n1960, and which is still in use today, remains 90% or more black.\" 338 F.Supp. at 588. \nThe legal conclusion of the District Judge is as follows: \n\"5. The Board's practice of shaping school attendance zones on a north-south rather than an east-\nwest orientation, with the result that zone boundaries conformed to racial residential dividing lines, \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis, 6 Cir., 333 F.2d 661.\" \n338 F.Supp. at 592-593. \n* * * * * * \n\"9. The manner in which the Board formulated and modified attendance zones for elementary \nschools had the natural and predictable effect of perpetuating racial segregation of students. Such \nconduct is an act of de jure discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. United States v. \nSchool District 151, D.C., 286 F.Supp. 786; Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, 4 Cir., 397 \nF.2d 37.\" 338 F.Supp. at 593. \nThere is, of course, other legal support for the conclusions set out above. Davis v. School District of \nPontiac, 443 F.2d 573, 576 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 913, 92 S.Ct. 233, 30 L.Ed.2d 186 \n(1971); United States v. Board of Education, Ind.

Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, 867-868 (5th Cir. \n1965), aff'd in banc, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied sub nom. Caddo Parish School Board \nv.

Pasadena Board of Education, 311 F.Supp. 501, 522 (C.D.Cal. 1970). \nWitness Charles Wells, defendant School Board's assistant superintendent in charge of the Office of \nPupil Personnel Services, read into the record and testified in support of the minutes of a meeting of \nthe Citizens Association for Better Schools. Mr. Wells was the president of the Citizens' Association \nat the time the meeting was conducted. His testimony includes the following: \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas) Go ahead, sir. \n\"A. \"November 3, 1960. \n\"TO: Honorable Nathan Kaufman, Chairman Committee on Equal Education Opportunity. \n`We should like to begin our presentation by reviewing with you briefly the development of our \norganization. We feel it is significant as it represents an attempt on the part of people who make up \nthis organization to effectively deal with the frustrations historically inherent in attempting to provide \nfor minority 223*223 group children an adequate education within the Detroit Public School System. \nA majority of the people of the Negro race moved into the now Center District from other school \ndistricts within the limits of the City of Detroit. Although better housing conditions were but one of the \nmotives for such a move, of equal importance was a desire to provide their children with a more \nequitable and enriched educational experience. \n`They were aware of the increased population within their new geographical area, and accepted the \ncounselling of the then new administration of the Board of Education, to the effect that additional tax \nmonies would have to be made available if educational standards within the City of Detroit were to \nbe improved, or even maintained. Consequently, each of them made a strong personal investment in \nthe millage compaign of Spring 1959. In this campaign, initially, their efforts did not meet the \n\nwholehearted approval of the Negro community, since from past experience, particularly involving \nother millage campaigns, members of the Negro community had observed that the results of the \nexpenditures of monies obtained from additional taxes, had little effect on the facilities, the \nequipment, or the curriculum available to their children. \n`Despite this resistance, they were aware that there would be less justification for demanding \nadequate educational opportunities for their children if they did not accept their responsible share for \nthe successful passing of the millage program. As a consequence of their efforts, their respective \nschools voted overwhelmingly for the millage program, and they logically expected that positive \nresults would follow their efforts. \n`Their first disillusionment occurred only a few months, but yet a few weeks after the passage of the \nmillage — they were rewarded with the creation of the present Center District. In effect this District, \nwith a few minor exceptions, created a segregated school system. It accomplished with a few marks \nof the crayon on the map, the return of the Negro child from the few instances of an integrated \nschool exposure, to the traditional predominantly uniracial school system to which he had formerly \nbeen accustomed in the City of Detroit. \n`Their attempts to meet this threat to their children's educational experience through existing school \norganizations met with little success. Their conferences with District and City-Wide administrators \nincluding the superintendent, Dr. Samuel Brownell, resulted in only rationalizations concerning \nsegregated housing patterns, and denials of any attempts at segregation. When it was pointed out \nthat regardless of motivation, that segregation was the result of their boundary changes, little \ncompromise was effected, except in one or two instances, where opposition leadership was most \nvocal and aggressive. \n`Concurrent with boundary changes, it was alarmingly noticeable that the school population within \nthe Center District was rapidly increasing, and that the priority building program would have little \npositive effect in dealing with the problem. Attempts to discuss this problem with school and district \nadministration gave promise of only minimal relief. \n`Finally, it had been earlier noted by new residents moving into what is now the Center District that \nprior to and during its change from a uniracial (predominatly white) to a biracial system and again to \na uniracial (predominatly Negro) school system that the quality of their children's previous \neducational experiences did not equip them to compete on an equal basis with resident children in \nthe same grade and classifications. \n`These experiences made them aware that no one organization composed of one or several \nschools, could effectively coordinate the mutual concern of the many parents residing within the \nCenter District. Thus out of the several discussions of groups of people whose primary concern was \nthe adequate and equitable education of their children, this organization was born. It is felt that no \nbetter 224*224 description of its purpose, its objective, and its reason for being can be found than in \nthe preamble to its Constitution, which is: \n`PREAMBLE: Our interest is in equal educational opportunities for all persons within the City of \nDetroit. \n`We do not believe that such opportunities are possible within a segregated school system. \n`We oppose a policy of containment of minority groups within specified boundaries, an example of \nwhich is the Center District. While the above is of utmost concern to us we are also aware that there \n\nis need for improvement and enrichment of the standards within this district in practice as well as in \ntheory. \n`We believe that once standards have become reasonably adequate, that such standards should be \nmaintained. It should be further recognized that future population shifts brought about by urban \nredevelopment will adversely affect the above goals in the Center District, unless there is \nanticipation of the impact of this population growth upon this district. \n`Since the inception of our organization we have noted the following: \n`The public school system of the City of Detroit is divided into nine administrative districts, one of \nwhich is the Center District. \n`Yet, every day, when the children in this city leave their homes to go forth to public schools, \napproximately one out of every four leaves a home in the Center District. Of the 154,969 children \nenrolled in public elementary schools as of September 30, 1960, 36,264 or 23.4 percent of these \nchildren leave a home in the Center District. \n`There are 221 elementary school buildings in the Detroit Public School System. Of these 28 are in \nthe Center District. This means, then, that the 23.4 percent of the total elementary school population \nis accommodated in 12.7 percent of the buildings. \n`Fifteen percent of these children sit in classes of 40 to 44 students per class. This is in comparison \nto: \n     East               .13 percent \n     North              .05 percent \n     Northeast          .04 percent \n     Northwest          .08 percent \n     South              .01 percent \n     Southeast          .01 percent \n     West               .05 percent \n`Sixty-two and one-half percent of all the children in the city's elementary schools who sit in classes \nof 45 to 49 are children in the Center District. These schools in the Center District find their \ncapacities short by 6,352 pupil stations. In other words, their capacities are overtaxed to the extent \nof 16 percent; and the future building program, as set forth by the superintendent's report of October \n17, 1960, will make available only 11,189 additional pupil stations within the next ten-year period. \nHowever, this will be insufficient to meet the demands of the Center District. Therefore, it is apparent \nthat a school bussing program will have to become a permanent part of the school housing program. \nThus the manner in which the bussing program is administered becomes a matter of acute concern. \n`Presently, children are being bussed by grades. Under this system a number of problems are \ncreated: \n1) It makes necessary a reorganization of the bussing school, as well as the school into which the \nchildren are bussed. \n2) They are not integrated into the school into which they are bussed, except in minor instances. \n3) There is a possibility of the separation of the family unit. \n4) Parents are unable to establish a good rapport with the teachers and administrators in the new \nschool since there exists a time limit in which these children will be members of that school. \n\n`It is recommended that a policy of bussing by geographical areas instead of 225*225 by grades be \ninstituted so as to eliminate the above problems. \n`The emphasis on curricula objective are not comparable in the various school districts of the Detroit \nSchool System. There is a tendency in the Center District to stereotype the educational capacity of \nthe children. This means that children entering the schools in this district whose background enables \nthem to comprehend an enriched educational program, are not challenged. \n`For example, one student in the Hutchins Intermediate School who desired to prepare for entrance \ninto an Eastern college found that Latin was not offered, and only after considerable effort by \nmembers of the community, along with his family, was Latin placed back in the school curriculum. \nMany other instances can be cited upon request. \n`Conversely, children whose initial capacity is retarded by deprived socio-economic circumstances \nalso go unchallenged. The District Administrator has admitted that no program exists to take care of \nthese children. \n`The curriculum and counselling as they now exist, do not encourage students to achieve their \nmaximum capacities. We feel that the responsibility for any inequities in the educational experience \noffered to any group of children within a given school system must be assumed by those persons \ncharged with the overall responsibility of administering that system. \n`Therefore, we recommend that strong policies be adopted by the top administration to erase \ninequities of the Detroit Public School System, and a policy of supervision through all levels of \nadministration be instituted at all levels of administration to insure equal educational opportunities to \nall children. \n`The Citizens' Association for Better Schools.' \n\"Q. Do you join in that statement in submission to the committee? \n\"A. Yes, I did.\" \nMr. Wells cited the example of the Center (administrative) District, where attendance boundaries \nwere shaped in a gerrymandered fashion to conform to the racial residential pattern. \n\"Q. With regard to that same situation, you were expressing a problem which your committee had \nmet in attempting to discuss this. Can you tell me how you came to be discussing this with the Board \nat that time? \n\"A. It was not with the Board of Education, I believe it was with the administration of the school \nsystem. \n\"Q. The administrative staff? \n\"A. Including the superintendent. \n\"Q. All right. \n\"A. Our initial concern about the boundaries of the center district grew out of the concern we had in \n1960 about the changing of the attendance areas between the Central High School and the \nMackenzie High School. \n\"Q. Is that the optional attendance area also set up in that? \n\"A. A part of that was optional. Well, let's put it that way, a part of it had been optional, the proposal \nwas to eliminate the option. In the process of eliminating the option what it would mean would be \nthat by and large the few black children who had been attending Mackenzie would have been pulled \nback into the Central area. \n\n\"Q. Mackenzie at that time was a majority white school? \n\"A. Predominately white. \n\"Q. Central by that time had become black? \n\"A. Predominately black. \n\"Q. So the cancellation of the optional area which had been there had the effect of preventing black \nchildren choosing Mackenzie, is that correct? \n\"A. That is right. \n\"Q. Were there any other schools — there is a reference made to the establishment of the center \ndistrict boundaries — were there any other 226*226schools which had not previously been in certain \nfeeder patterns that were drawn back into the center district? \n\"A. I am trying to remember now as I said eleven years. \n\"Q. I understand. \n\"A. If I remember correctly, the Sherrill School which also had been a part of it, that portion north of \nTireman had been attending Mackenzie and they in turn, the total school then would have been \nreturned to the Chadsey area. \n\"Q. What about Tappan and that area, are you familiar at all with changes that took place? \n\"A. Tappan was the junior high school in which Winterhalter, the elementary school in the area south \nof Davison just west of Ewald Circle attended. At that time the students from that area attended \nTappan and all students from Tappan attended Mackenzie. \n\"The new change would mean that the students from Winterhalter, and I think McKerrow which is \njust below Winterhalter would have attended Tappan through the 9th grade, but then had been \npulled back into the center district to attend Central High School. \n\"The other students in Tappan would have gone to Mackenzie. \n\"Q. The other students in Tappan, were they predominately white students? \n\"A. Yes. Our concern about this region really at that time was that we could draw a line which \nseparated the black residents from the white residents and almost to the alley and that in effect was \nthe boundary line of the center district.\" \nThere was evidence that school feeder patterns were changed so as to make particular junior high \nschools or senior high schools either generally white or generally black, as shown in the following \ntestimony: \n\"MR. CALDWELL: Your Honor, I have copies of the Mumford High School district in 1959 which is \ntaken from Plaintiff's Exhibit 78-A, and this makes it easier to see the schools. \n\"Q. Let's get back to the 1962-63 overlay. \n\"Prior to the 1962-63 — first of all, will you point out to the Court where the Vandenberg and Vernor \nSchools are. \n\"A. This triangle to the northwest corner of this area. (indicating) \n\"Q. Prior to 1962-63 where did the Vernor and Vandenberg youngsters go to high school? \n\"A. Mumford High School. \n\"Q. A boundary change was made in 1962-63? \n\"A. That's right. \n\"Q. Where did those youngsters go to school in that year? \n\"A. Ford High School. \n\"Q. How long did that feeder pattern continue? \n\"A. Until 1966-67 when they returned to Mumford. \n\"Q. All right. \n\"MR. CALDWELL: Plaintiffs' Exhibit 128-A, your Honor, reflects that in 1960 Vandenberg and Vernor \nwere 0 percent black. Mumford was 16.1 black, Ford was .1 percent black. With regard to \nVandenberg and Vernor, there was a gradual increase in the black population until 1966 when \nVandenberg was 39.5 percent black and Vernor was 39.8 percent black. \n\n\"Then in 1967 the change was made taking Vandenberg and Vernor back into Mumford. \nVandenberg had become 70 percent black, Vernor had become 63.2 percent black. That year the \nchange was made and Mumford was 78.1 percent black, Ford was 4.1 percent black. \n\"Q. I believe that feeder pattern continued into the current school year? \n\"A. That is right. \n227*227 \"Q. Those schools now feed back into Ford High School this year? \n\"A. That is right.\" \nThe effect of such a policy was attested to by Dr. Gordon Foster of the University of Miami, director \nof the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center: \n\"Q. The effect, Doctor, then, of the removal of Vandenberg and Vernor from the Ford feeder pattern \ninto the Mumford feeder pattern, what was the effect in terms of race? \n\"A. The effect of this move in 1967-68 of the transfer back of the two elementary schools was to \nincrease the segregation at Mumford, to take blacks from the Ford High School and, therefore, \nincrease the segregated pattern there, and, in my opinion, it reinforced inevitably the perception that \nFord would be kept white as a matter of basic policy and that Mumford would be a racially contained \nisolated high school attendance area.\" \nSimilar testimony regarding the segregative effect of altering school feeder patterns was given with \nrespect to the Jefferson and Hutchins Junior High Schools, Garfield and Spain Junior High Schools, \nBurton and Irving Elementary Schools, Higginbotham Elementary School, Jackson and Foch Junior \nHigh Schools, Stellwagen, Keating and Clark Elementary Schools, Cleveland and Nolan Junior High \nSchools, Courville Elementary School, Ford and Brooks Junior High Schools, Osborne and Pershing \nHigh Schools, Parkman Elementary School, the Ellis, Sills, Newberry and Sampson Elementary \nSchools, and Northwestern and Chadsey High Schools. \nThe District Judge made the following findings of fact pertaining to busing black children to black \nschools past white schools: \n\"The Board, in the operation of its transportation to relieve overcrowding policy, has admittedly \nbused black pupils past or away from closer white schools with available space to black schools. \nThis practice has continued in several instances in recent years despite the Board's avowed policy, \nadopted in 1967, to utilize transportation to increase integration. \n\"With one exception (necessitated by the burning of a white school), defendant Board has never \nbused white children to predominantly black schools. The Board has not bused white pupils to black \nschools despite the enormous amount of space available in inner-city schools. There were 22,961 \nvacant seats in schools 90% or more black.\" 338 F.Supp. at 588. \nThe legal conclusion of the District Judge follows: \n\"8. The practice of the Board of transporting black students from overcrowded black schools to other \nidentifiably black schools, while passing closer identifiably white schools, which could have accepted \nthese pupils, amounted to an act of segregation by the school authorities.

I am trying to anticipate, Mr. Ritchie's question. Have you noted some examples of the bussing of \nblack children from black schools to other black schools? \n\"A. I have. \n228*228 \"Q. Could you give us a couple illustrations? \n\"MR. BUSHNELL: While Dr. Foster is looking through his notes, might I make the request that we \nmade yesterday that on conclusion of his testimony we have access to the notes made? \n\"MR. LUCAS: At the conclusion, yes. We have no objection to that. \n\"A. In 1960-61, and we don't have any record for '61-62 so I am not certain as to that year, students \nwere transported from Angell to Greenfield Park. This has already been part of our testimony, I \nbelieve, 186 students and students from Angell to Higginbotham, 118 students. In 1969 — \n\"Q. Excuse me, Doctor, let me ask you if the Angell-Higginbotham — were there white schools \navailable with space, from your examination of the records? \n\"A. Yes, there were. \n\"Q. Between Angell and Higginbotham? \n\"A. Yes, sir, I believe I testified to that before. \n\"Q. All right. \n\"A. In 1969 the Ruthruff Elementary School which was 99 percent black transported 143 children to \nHerman Elementary, 55 percent black. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas, continuing) Dr. Foster, would you step to the map. \n\"I think we were talking about the Ruthruff-Herman Schools. \n\"A. Yes. We were testifying at recess about transportation of blacks past white schools. In 1969 we \nstated that Ruthruff Elementary which is here in the southeastern portion of the Mackenzie High \nSchool zone on the large 1970-71 attendance area map, in 1969 transported 143 children to \nHerman Elementary School which is just below the blue area on the undermap here — Herman \nElementary School (indicating). Herman in 1969 was 55.6 percent black. Ruthruff was 99.1 percent \nblack and I think it is important to note that the access to Herman goes right past the Parkman \nElementary School which at that time had 136 spaces available and according to their capacity \nfigures — \n\"Q. Parkman was what percentage? \n\n\"A. Parkman I don't have the figure for '69 and '70. Parkman was 12.8 percent black.\" \n* * * * * * \n\"A. Another example was the Parker Elementary School which is in the general center of the \nMackenzie High School zone. Parker in 1970 was 79.4 black; 61 children were bussed from Parker \nagain to the Herman Elementary School which at that time was 58.5 percent black and again past \nthe Parkman Elementary which in 1970 was 12.8 percent black. \n\"Q. Did Parkman have capacity at that time, Doctor? \n\"A. Parkman in '70, according to my data, had 121 spaces. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. Excuse me, would you give us the A. L. Homes. \n\"MR. BUSHNELL: I thought the Court ruled on that? \n\"THE COURT: He says he is pursuing a non-cumulative matter here. If that be true he may go \nahead. \n\"A. A. L. Homes School, children were bussed from this school over to the McGraw School which is \nin the south end of the Northwestern District in center city. In 1970-71 the Post Junior High School, \nwhich is located — \n\"MR. BUSHNELL: If the Court please, Mr. Lucas just pointed out the location of Post which the \nwitness obviously couldn't find on the map. \n\"THE COURT: Well, he hasn't moved it. \n\"A. I noted the west section of Cooley instead of the east. The Post Junior High School and Clinton \nSchools, which are in the east section of the Cooley High School attendance zone transported 54 \nstudents to the Jefferson School which is now in the Murray zone and it is located in the eastern \nsection of the Murray High School attendance area. I 229*229think it is important to note that these \nstudents who were bussed came from a considerable distance north and there were several \npossibilities — \n\"Q. Excuse me, were the Post children in a black school or white school? \n\"A. The Post School this year, 1970-71 was 99.3 percent black. The Clinton School from which they \nalso came was 97 percent black. \n\"Q. What about Jefferson? \n\"A. Jefferson was 87.6 percent black. There were two or three other possibilities much closer to the \nPost-Clinton area. One would have been in the western portion of the Mackenzie district here \n(indicating). \n\n\"Q. What is the racial composition? \n\"A. At this time it had 35.4 percent black with a capacity of 109 stations available. Another possibility \nwould have been the Vetal School in the Redford zone, the southern portion of the Redford High \nSchool zone, which at this time was 2 percent black with vacancies of 203 pupil stations and a third \nalternative could have been the Coffey School to the east of the Ford attendance area which at this \ntime was 29 percent black with 69 pupil stations available. \n\"Q. Did you say to the east was part of the Ford attendance area or outside of that, Doctor? \n\"A. It's in the Ford attendance area. \n* * * * * * \n\"THE COURT: Well, to save time why don't we proceed on the assumption that that was his \ntestimony. But if it proves otherwise we will strike it. \n\"MR. LUCAS: Thank you, sir. \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas) Doctor, I understand that the policy of the district is that bussing to relieve \novercrowding would be done in such a manner as to improve integration at the receiving school. \nFrom your examination of the current bussing examples which you have given, do you have an \nopinion as to whether or not that policy has or has not been followed? \n\"A. Well, I think from the examples I have given so far it would give an indication that integration \ncould have been effected in a much better way if the children, instead of going to the schools would \nhave been dropped off at other schools where the racial balance was quite different. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. Are there any white schools from your examination of data, Doctor Foster, between Angell and \nHigginbotham which had capacity at that time? \n\"A. Yes, there were several which were a good deal closer to Angell than Higginbotham. The effect \nof this sort of zoning pattern was to provide segregated student ratios at all three of the elementary \nschools, and in terms of things that could be done or could have been done at that particular time to \ncorrect the segregated situation, it is my opinion that, first of all, the students being bussed from \nAngell could have been dropped off at any number of places on the way to Higginbotham, schools \nwhich had the space and had a better racial composition for this sort of input. This having been \ndone, zone lines could have been redrawn at these three schools to have approached a racial \nbalance situation which, in my opinion, would have helped to stabilize the situation at that time. This \nwould have also assisted in the overcrowding at Pasteur and a couple of classrooms extra at \nHigginbotham. \n\"Q. Do you have an opinion, Doctor as to the perception created by the maintenance of the \nHigginbotham School under those circumstances, including the transportation of black students from \nAngell into it? \n\"A. Well, it is obvious that if you transport black children past white schools to an all black school that \nthe community is going to perceive this as a segregated intent, a segregated action. If you have a \n\nboundary situation which isolates and enforces black students to a particular area when the \nboundary lines could be changed to effectuate a better 230*230 pattern racially, then it seems to me \nthat community perception would also be that the school is not doing what it could in terms of \nintegration and equal opportunity. \n\"Q. Doctor, from your examination of the data in 1960 are there any administrative reasons, any \nadministrative problems which would indicate to you a reason why this boundary was maintained \nrather than drawn in some other fashion? \n\"A. In terms of school capacity there are none, no.\" \nDefendant's witness (Mr. Henrickson) admitted instances of busing black students past closer white \nschools to black schools: \n\"Q. We find on the under and over capacity map in the Higginbotham area that there were three \nschools surrounding Higginbotham. Vernor, which is listed as being 121 over capacity; MacDowell, \n103, is it? Pasteur, 90. At the same time we find that Higginbotham was 489 under capacity. Is that \nwhat the exhibit shows, sir? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. We also know, do we not, that Pasteur, MacDowell and Vernor were white schools? \n\"A. Both Pasteur and MacDowell at that time, as I recall, had some beginning of black students as a \nresult of the growth of the settlement of the Higginbotham area. \n\"Q. They were predominantly white schools at that time? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. Higginbotham was all or virtually all black? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. Indeed, it had been the same in 1950, had it not? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. At the same time that we are talking about you were transporting youngsters from Angell to \nHigginbotham, is that correct? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. Those were black kids being transported from Angell to Higginbotham? \n\"A. Yes. \n\"Q. We also know on that exhibit that they were transported past such schools as Fitzgerald and \nClinton which had more than enough capacity to handle them? \n\"A. We have made no denial of that.\" \nFor some years it was a Board of Education policy to transport classrooms of black children intact to \nwhite schools where they were educated in segregated classes. \nTestimony as to the intact busing practice follows: \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas, continuing) Will you go into the Detroit system, Doctor, on transportation. \n\"A. Answering it generally, counsellor, my answer would be that the intact bussing is the practice of \ntransporting classrooms of children intact from one school to another and leaving them intact when \nthey are educated at the receiving school. \n\"Q. Doctor, when such transportation occurs from a school which is 90 percent or more black to a \nschool which is predominantly a white school, what effect, if any, does this have in terms of racial \nsegregation on those children? \n\"A. This would lead to what we call classroom segregation or segregation within a particular school. \nIt could be sometimes resegregation, but essentially it is a segregated situation within a school \nwhich could be segregated or not segregated generally. \n\n\"Q. Doctor, in your experience with school segregation and school desegregation plans, is this a \ntechnique which you have had to deal with in the past? \n\"A. On occasion, yes, sir. \n231*231 \"Q. Doctor, did you examine data or relevant information with respect to the transportation \npractices in the Detroit school system in connection with this type of bussing, intact bussing? \n\"A. Yes, sir. \n\"Q. What did your examination reveal, Doctor? \n\"A. It is my understanding from the data that there was intact bussing generally in the late '50's, as I \nsaid, and early '60's. \n\"Q. How did that intact transportation operate, Doctor? \n\"A. It involved transporting classrooms in whole from one school to another receiving school and at \nthe receiving school the classrooms were kept intact for instructional purposes. \n\"Q. Was this policy changed at any time, Doctor, as far as you know? \n\"A. It is my understanding it was changed in the middle '60's but I don't remember the exact date. \n\"Q. What would the change be, Doctor? What type of bussing would result in terms of relieving \novercrowding? \n\"A. You simply gather children up on a geographical basis and transport them and assign them at \nrandom to whatever grade they are in the receiving school rather than keeping them in an intact \nclassroom.\" \nSegregating children by race within schools has been held repeatedly to be \nunconstitutional. Jackson v. Marvell School District No. 22, 425 F.2d 211, 212 (8th Cir. \n1970); Johnson v. Jackson Parish School Board, 423 F.2d 1055 (5th Cir. 1970). \nThe record indicates that in at least one instance Detroit served a suburban school district by \ncontracting with it to educate its black high school students in a Detroit high school which was \noverwhelmingly black by transporting them away from nearby suburban white high schools and past \nDetroit high schools which were predominantly white. \nThe District Judge found on this score that for years black children in the Carver School District were \nassigned to black schools in the inner city because no white suburban district (or white school in the \ncity) would take the children. \nThis finding is supported by the testimony of Detroit School Superintendent Drachler, which follows: \n\"Q. When was the Carver District in existence as a separate entity? \n\"A. The Carver District? The Carver is not in Detroit. \n\"Q. Is it a separate school district whose students attended some Detroit high schools, in particular \nNorthern? \n\"A. Oh, I see what you're referring to. I am told that back in '57, '58, at that time I was not in Central \nOffice, there were some students from Carver District who did not have a place for adequate high \nschool facilities. An arrangement was made with Detroit for the Carver students to come in on buses \nand go to Northern High School. Now, the nearest school to Carver was Mumford at the time. And \nthey did go past Mumford towards Northern. \n\"Q. Is Carver a black district? \n\"A. Yes, black and very poor. \n\"Q. Has Carver District subsequently merged with Detroit? \n\"A. Oak Park. \n\"Q. With Oak Park? \n\"A. That's right. \n\"Q. And at that time the transportation was terminated? \n\n\"A. That's right. By the way, as a result of those youngsters coming, there was a rumor spread that \nDetroit children were being bussed, say, from the Higginbotham, which is north — Higginbotham \narea which is north of Mumford High School area but in Detroit, that they were being bussed to \nNorthern, too, because they were black 232*232 students, people saw black students from the Eight \nMile area coming down. But to the best of my knowledge these were outside students. \n\"Q. There were black children being bussed to Higginbotham weren't they? \n\"A. There were black children being bussed to Higginbotham. \n\"Q. From Angell? \n\"A. From Angell past some white schools. And when the issue was brought to Doctor Brownell's \nattention by me in about '59 or '60 — there were a series of instances like that. There was the \nAngell, there was from the military fort in the southwest, they were bussing their own children up to \nthe Noble, and Doctor Brownell, as soon as it was brought to his attention, abolished that as well as \nthe optional areas. \n\"Q. Was this so-called intact bussing, that is a class being brought as a unit? \n\"A. Generally speaking, yes. That policy of changing to geographic bussing occurred about '62-'63 \nas a result of the Equal Education Opportunities Committee. \n\"Q. Was all of the bussing done in the City of Detroit of an intact nature until the Equal Opportunities \nstudy? \n\"A. To the best of my knowledge it was. I know when my children were being bussed, they were \nbussed intact.\" \n(2) Optional Areas. \nThe record demonstrates that in many instances when neighborhoods in Detroit began to \nexperience some immigration of black families, it was Board of Education policy to create optional \nattendance zones, thereby allowing white students to change schools to all white or predominately \nwhite schools, generally located farther toward the city limits. For many years the record indicates \nthis practice to have been pervasive. It continued in at least one instance up to the 1970-71 school \nyear. \nAs to optional attendance zones, the District Judge found: \n\"During the decade beginning in 1950 the Board created and maintained optional attendance zones \nin neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high school attendance areas of opposite \npredominant racial compositions. In 1959 there were eight basic optional attendance areas affecting \n21 schools. Optional attendance areas provided pupils living within certain elementary areas a \nchoice of attendance at one of two high schools. In addition there was at least one optional area \neither created or existing in 1960 between two junior high schools of opposite predominant racial \ncomponents. All of the high school optional areas, except two, were in neighborhoods undergoing \nracial transition (from white to black) during the 1950s. The two exceptions were: (1) the option \nbetween Southwestern (61.6% black in 1960) and Western (15.3% black); (2) the option between \nDenby (0% black) and Southeastern (30.9% black). With the exception of the Denby-Southeastern \noption (just noted) all of the options were between high schools of opposite predominant racial \ncompositions. The Southwestern-Western and Denby-Southeastern optional areas are all white on \nthe 1950, 1960 and 1970 census maps. Both Southwestern and Southeastern, however, had \nsubstantial white pupil populations, and the option allowed whites to escape integration. The natural, \nprobable, foreseeable and actual effect of these optional zones was to allow white youngsters to \nescape identifiably `black' schools. There had also been an optional zone (eliminated between 1956 \nand 1959) created in `an attempt . . . to separate Jews and Gentiles within the system,' the effect of \nwhich was that Jewish youngsters went to Mumford High School and Gentile youngsters went to \nCooley. Although many of these optional areas had served their purpose by 1960 due 233*233 to the \nfact that most of the areas had become predominantly black, one optional area (Southwestern-\nWestern affecting Wilson Junior High graduates) continued until the present school year (and will \ncontinue to effect 11th and 12th grade white youngsters who elected to escape from predominantly \n\nblack Southwestern to predominantly white Western High School). Mr. Henrickson, the Board's \ngeneral fact witness, who was employed in 1959 to, inter alia, eliminate optional areas, noted in \n1967 that: `In operation Western appears to be still the school to which white students escape from \npredominantly Negro surrounding schools.' The effect of eliminating this optional area (which \naffected only 10th graders for the 1970-71 school year) was to decrease Southwestern from 86.7% \nblack in 1969 to 74.3% black in 1970.\" 338 F. Supp. at 587-588. \nFrom these facts the District Judge arrived at the following legal conclusion: \n\"7. The Board's policy of selective optional attendance zones, to the extent that it facilitated the \nseparation of pupils on the basis of race, was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hobson v. \nHansen, D.C., 269 F.Supp. 401, aff'd sub nom., Smuck v. Hobson, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 408 F. 2d \n175. [(1969)].\" 338 F.Supp. at 593. \nAdditional support for the District Judge's legal conclusion includes: United States v. Texas \nEducation Agency, 467 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1972); Northcross v. Board of Education of Memphis, 333 \nF.2d 661, 665-666 (6th Cir. 1964) (different but analogous situation); United States v. Board of \nSchool Commissioners of Indianapolis, 332 F.Supp. 655, 668 (S.D.Ind.1971) aff'd 474 F.2d 81 (7th \nCir. 1973); Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 311 F.Supp. 501, 502 (C.D.Cal.1970). \nThe effect of use of optional zones was described in Dr. Foster's testimony: \n\"The first method or technique I might cite that is used to maintain segregation would be the use of \noptional zones. \n\"Would it be possible for me to step to the board to illustrate? \n\"Q. Please do. \n(The witness proceeded to the blackboard.) \n\"A. Optional zones are sometimes also referred to as dual zones or dual overlapping zones. I think it \nwill be easier for me to illustrate this briefly. \n(The witness drew a sketch on the board.) \n\"A. If you have, let's say, two high school districts, District X and District Y, frequently when you set \nup an optional zone you carve the zone out of one district, occasionally two, but assume we carve it \nout of District Y and the children in this optional zone are then permitted to go to either high school X \nor high school Y, this becomes in a sense an overlapping zone because if we refer to the boundaries \nof school District X at this point it not only includes the previous boundary but also takes in the \noptional zone. \n\"District Y in turn would include its previous boundaries, also including the optional zone. I think this \nmay explain the origin of the connotation of the word `overlapping'. \n\"Essentially optional zones are set up for two or three reasons, one is to allow white students or \nblack students the option of attending one of the two attendance areas which make up the \nboundaries of the zone and another is for, occasionally for religious purposes to provide alternatives \nfor persons of different religions. Sometimes these are set up for socio-economic reasons and I have \non occasion seen them set up by boards of superintendents as political gimicks in order to help pass \na bond issue or one thing or another or a school board or superintendent will set up temporary \noptional zones as a favor to certain constitutents in 234*234 return for assistance in helping the \nschool board with one thing or another. \n\"I think in the framework in which we operate they are used primarily for maintaining segregated \npatterns. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. Dr. Foster, have you made a study and analysis of optional zones in the Detroit school system? \n\"A. Yes, I have.\" \n\nDr. Foster's analysis of the purpose and effect of each optional zone in existence in the Detroit \nSchool District is exemplified in his testimony on the Mackenzie-Central option. \n\"Q. Doctor Foster, do you have an opinion as to the administrative use of the optional attendance \nzone in 1960 between and prior to that in Mackenzie-Central area? \n\"A. Yes. I think it was used primarily — you mean as to the purpose of it? \n\"Q. Well, as to whether or not it had any administrative value that you know of, Doctor, aside from \nrace? \n\"A. In terms of assignment I can see no advantage to it. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. Do you have an opinion as to its use in terms of segregation or desegration, Doctor Foster? \n\"A. In my opinion it was used as an optional zone to allow whites during the period it was in \nexistence in the '50's and also until such time as it was done away with in 1962 to be assigned to \npredominantly white Mackenzie High School. \n\"Q. Doctor Foster, from your examination of the 1950 census and in turn the 1960 census exhibits, \ndo you have an opinion as to the effect of such an optional zone on the community residence pattern \nin the community? \n* * * * * * \n\"A. Community people and residents in a situation such as this generally have a perception that \nthere is something wrong with their school, that the whites need an optional zone to get out into a \nless black situation and, therefore, this increases their perception of racial isolation and, in fact, \nphysical containment. \n\"Q. Does this have an effect, Doctor, in terms of the residence pattern? I believe you testified in 1950 \nthe optional area was entirely white or zero to 4.9 per cent white. \n* * * * * * \n\"A. In my opinion this tends to increase the instability of the community because they generally feel \nthis is an ad hoc temporary interim situation and it increases white flight in this sort of situation. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. Doctor Foster, does the use of these techniques in some areas have an effect in terms of the \nperception of the community of schools besides the actual two schools to which the option was \ninvolved? \n* * * * * * \n\"A. Thank you. Yes, I think the perception is not only of rank and file community residents, but \npeople of considerable influence in the community, along with School Board administration people, \nSchool Board members, School Board officials. In many cases they have substantiated this \nperception that I have recounted; that the optional zones did lead to greater pupil segregation and a \nfeeling of frustration that the school authorities were not doing what was called for in terms of \ndesegregation, and it had a generally debilitating effect on the image of the schools as far as all of \nthese groups were concerned.\" \nMr. Henrickson, defendant School Board's principal witness and divisional director of planning and \nbuilding studies in the School Housing Division, did not deny the discriminatory effect of at least \nsome of these optional zones. \n235*235 \"Q. In 1959 optional areas frustrated integration, did they not? \n\"MR. BUSHNELL: Objection to the form of the question. \n\"THE COURT: He may answer. \n\"A. Some of these areas in 1959 had no effect whatever with movement of black or white students. \nThey were either all black or all white. Some of them such as the Western-Southwestern area can \nbe said to have frustrated integration and continued over the decade.\" \n(3) Building Construction. \n\nThe District Judge found and the record contains evidence that the Detroit Board of Education \npractices in school construction generally tended to have segregative effect; the great majority of \nschools were built in either overwhelmingly all black or all white neighborhoods so that the new \nschools opened as one race schools. \nThe District Judge's school construction findings were as follows: \n\"In 1966 the defendant State Board of Education and Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a \nJoint Policy Statement on Equality of Educational Opportunity, requiring that \n`Local school boards must consider the factor of racial balance along with other educational \nconsiderations in making decisions about selection of new school sites, expansion of present \nfacilities . . . . Each of these situations presents an opportunity for integration.' \nDefendant State Board's `School Plant Planning Handbook' requires that \n`Care in site locations must be taken if a serious transportation problem exists or if housing patterns \nin an area would result in a school largely segregated on racial, ethnic, or socio-economic lines.' \nThe defendant City Board has paid little heed to these statements and guidelines. The State \ndefendants have similarly failed to take any action to effectuate these policies. Exhibit NN reflects \nconstruction (new or additional) at 14 schools which opened for use in 1970-71; of these 14 schools, \n11 opened over 90% black and one opened less than 10% black. School construction costing \n$9,222,000 is opening at Northwestern High School which is 99.9% black, and new construction \nopens at Brooks Junior High, which is 1.5% black, at a cost of $2,500,000. The construction at \nBrooks Junior High plays a dual segregatory role: not only is the construction segregated, it will \nresult in a feeder pattern change which will remove the last majority white school from the already \nalmost all-black Mackenzie High School attendance area. \n\"Since 1959 the Board has constructed at least 13 small primary schools with capacities of from 300 \nto 400 pupils.

Doctor Foster, I show you a document in evidence, Plaintiff's Exhibit 70. I direct your attention to \npage 15 of the exhibit. The exhibit is School Planning Handbook, Bulletin 412, revised, January, \n\n1970, Michigan Department of Education. Directing your attention to Chapter 2, the School Site, and \nthe last full paragraph in the left-hand column on page 15, Doctor, would you read that paragraph? \n\"A. `Care in site location must be taken if a serious transportation problem exists or if housing \npatterns in an area would result in a school largely segregated on racial, ethnic or socio-economic \nlines.' \n\"Q. Doctor, would you step down to the map, please? Do you have a copy, Doctor, of Plaintiff's \nExhibit 79? \n\"A. Yes, I do. \n\"Q. Doctor, would you examine Plaintiff's Exhibit 153, which shows new school construction, 1960 to \n1970? Perhaps you had better step back here. Doctor, the black squares on here represent schools \nopening 80 to 100 per cent black in pupil enrollment. Would you direct your attention to the Drew \nJunior High School on the map and examine the exhibit and tell me when Drew was opened? \n\"A.

Its population and percent black? \n\"A. 766 enrollment, 98.8 percent black. \n\"Q. Marxhausen Primary, Doctor, can you locate that on the map? \n\"A. Marxhausen is in the Finney zone. \n\"Q. Is that near or far away from the A. L. Holmes School, Doctor? \n\"A. As I remember, rather close to the Holmes School. \n237*237 \"Q. Can you locate the Holmes School with reference to that? \n\"A. The Holmes School is the next one to the northwest. \n\"Q. And what was its pupil population when it opened? \n\"A. Marxhausen was opened in 1970 with a pupil population of 302, 92.4 percent black. \n\"Q. Would you locate Mack Primary, Doctor? \n\"A. Mack Primary is also in the Finney zone. \n\"Q. And when did it open? \n\"A. Mack opened in 1970 with an enrollment of 173, 98.8 percent black. \n\"Q. Could you locate the Angell Primary area, Doctor? \n\"A. The Angell area is in the Northwestern attendance zone. \n\"Q. And what was its enrollment and percent black? \n\"A. Angell was 1,282 students when it opened in 1970. The percent black was 99.9. \n\"Q. Is there an asterisk by that particular school, Doctor? \n\"A. On the exhibit? \n\"Q. Yes. \n\n\"A. Yes, there is. \n\"Q. Would you refer to the cover and tell us what that asterisk indicates? \n\"A. It says, `The racial count data included in existing school with the same name.' \n\"Q.

What was its per cent black? \n\"A. 100 per cent black.\" \nSimilar testimony was given with respect to the Stevenson, Cortez, Beaubien, Sander, St. Clair \nAnnex, Murray, Kettering, Krolik, Joy, Tendler, Belleville, McGraw, Knudsen, Keidan, Jamieson, \nButzel, Woodward, Tendler and Norvell Schools. White schools built to accommodate white \nresidential areas included Fox, Lessenger, Murphy, Taft, Fleming, Earhart, Reeves, Brooks and \nMcKenny Annex. \n\"Q. Thank you, Doctor. \n\"Doctor Foster, from your examination of the pattern of construction in this school system, 1960 to \n1970, do you have an opinion as to the effect of that pattern of construction on segregation in the \nDetroit School System? \n\"A. My opinion is that construction practices were followed in such a way as to increase segregation. \nI say 238*238 this because of the large number of schools that were opened that were either all \nblack or all white or with a disproportionate number of one race or the other upon opening. \n* * * * * * \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas) Does the location of a school in a particular place have a long term effect on a \nschool system? \n\"A. In terms of the nature of the pupils assigned to the school, do you mean? \n\"Q. Yes, sir. \n\"A. Yes, it does. \n\"Q. Are there alternatives in schoolhouse construction which can or should be considered by a \nschool district in terms of affecting the racial composition of student bodies? \n\"A. In terms of site selection there are, yes. \n\"Q. What are some of the alternatives which can or should be utilized, in your opinion, Doctor? \n\"A. It is customary in this day and age to consider the problem of integration or segregation very \ncarefully in selecting sites for school buildings and, well, this was pointed out, I believe, in the bit I \nread from the Michigan State Department. \n\"Q. What effect in terms of perception of the community does it have when a school is opened with \nan overwhelming enrollment of one race or the other? \n\"A. Generally the community perceives, in my opinion, that the school has been thought of as being, \ngoing to be an all white school or all black school and in either case generally that it is racially \nisolated.\" \n(B) The constitutional violations found to have been \ncommitted by the State of Michigan. \n\n(1) School districts in the State of Michigan are instrumentalities of the State and subordinate to its \nState Board of Education and legislature. (See § V(A), pp. 245-249, infra.) Hence, the segregative \nactions and inactions of the Detroit Board of Education previously outlined are the actions of an \nagency of the State of Michigan. \n(2) In 1970 the Detroit School Board undertook implementation of its April 7 desegregation plan \napplicable to its high schools. On meeting considerable resistance thereto, it nonetheless \nproceeded. At that point the State Legislature intervened by Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 \nspecifically overruling the Detroit Board of Education's desegregation plan. While this statute has \nsince been invalidated by judgment of this court, 433 F.2d 897, its contribution to preventing \ndesegregation and to continuing and increasing segregation of the Detroit school system cannot be \noverlooked. \n(3) Under Michigan law, M.S.A. § 15.1961, M.C.L.A. 388.851, school building construction plans \nmust be approved by the State Board of Education. Prior to 1962 the State Board also had specific \nstatutory authority to supervise school site selection. The proofs concerning the effect of Detroit's \nschool construction program are therefore largely applicable to show State responsibility for the \nsegregative results. \n(4) During the critical years covered by this record the School District of Detroit was denied any \nallocation of State funds for pupil transportation, although such funds were made generally available \nfor students who lived over a mile and a half from their assigned schools in rural Michigan. \n(5) Finally, the cross-district transportation of black high school students from the Carver School, \nlocated in Ferndale school district, to a black high school in Detroit could not have taken place \nwithout the approval, tacit or express, of the State Board of Education. (See supra pp. 231-232 \nThe District Judge's findings pertaining to constitutional violations by the State of Michigan are as \nfollows: \n\"The State and its agencies, in addition to their general responsibility for and supervision of public \neducation, 239*239 have acted directly to control and maintain the pattern of segregation in the \nDetroit schools. The State refused, until this session of the legislature, to provide authorization of \nfunds for the transportation of pupils within Detroit regardless of their poverty or distance from the \nschool to which they were assigned, while providing in many neighboring, mostly white, suburban \ndistricts the full range of state supported transportation. This and other financial limitations, such as \nthose on bonding and the working of the state aid formula whereby suburban districts were able to \nmake far larger per pupil expenditures despite less tax effort, have created and perpetuated \nsystematic educational inequalities. \n\"The State, exercising what Michigan courts have held to be is `plenary power' which includes power \n`to use a statutory scheme, to create, alter, reorganize or even dissolve a school district, despite any \ndesire of the school district, its board, or the inhabitants thereof,' acted to reorganize the school \ndistrict of the City of Detroit. \n\"The State acted through Act 48 to impede, delay and minimize racial integration in Detroit schools. \nThe first sentence of Sec. 12 of the Act was directly related to the April 7, 1970 desegregation plan. \nThe remainder of the section sought to prescribe for each school in the eight districts criterion of \n`free choice' open enrollment) and `neighborhood schools' (`nearest school priority acceptance'), \nwhich had as their purpose and effect the maintenance of segregation. \n\"In view of our findings of fact already noted we think it unnecessary to parse in detail the activities of \nthe local board and the state authorities in the area of school construction and the furnishing of \nschool facilities. It is our conclusion that these activities were in keeping, generally, with the \n\ndiscriminatory practices which advanced or perpetuated racial segregation in these schools.\" 338 \nF.Supp. at 589. \nThe District Judge arrived at the following legal conclusions: \n\"11. Under the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and laws of the State of \nMichigan, the responsibility for providing educational opportunity to all children on constitutional \nterms is ultimately that of the state. Turner v. Warren County Board of Education, D.C., 313 F.Supp. \n380; Art. VIII, §§ 1 and 2, Mich. Constitution; Daszkiewicz v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. of City of Detroit, 301 \nMich. 212, 3 N.W.2d 71. \n\"12. That a state's form of government may delegate the power of daily administration of public \nschools to officials with less than state-wide jurisdiction does not dispel the obligation of those who \nhave broader control to use the authority they have consistently with the constitution. In such \ninstances the constitutional obligation toward the individual school children is a shared one. Bradley \nv. Sch. Bd. of City of Richmond, D.C., 51 F.R.D. 139, 143. \n\"13. Leadership and general supervision over all public education is vested in the State Board of \nEducation. Art. VIII, § 3, Mich. Constitution of 1963. The duties of the State Board and \nsuperintendent include, but are not limited to, specifying the number of hours necessary to constitute \na school day; approval until 1962 of school sites; approval of school construction plans; accreditation \nof schools; approval of loans based on state aid funds; review of suspensions and expulsions of \nindividual students for misconduct [Op.Atty.Gen., July 7, 1970, No. 4705]; authority over \ntransportation routes and disbursement of transportation funds; teacher certification and the like. M. \nS.A. 15.1023(1), M.C.L.A. § 388.1001. State law provides review procedures from actions of local or \nintermediate districts (see M.S.A. 15.3442, M.C.L. 240*240 A. § 340.442), with authority in the State \nBoard to ratify, reject, amend or modify the actions of these inferior state agencies. See M.S.A. \n15.3467; 15.1919(61); 15.1919(68(b)); 15.2299 (1); 15.1961; 15.3402, M.C.L.A. §§ 340.467, \n388.621, 388.628(a), 388.681, 388.851, 340.402; Bridgehampton School District No. 2 Fractional of \nCarsonville, Mich. v. Supt. of Public Instruction, 323 Mich. 615, 36 N.W.2d 166. In general, the state \nsuperintendent is given the duty `[t]o do all things necessary to promote the welfare of the public \nschools and public educational instructions and provide proper educational facilities for the youth of \nthe state.' M.S.A. 15.3252, M.C.L.A. § 340.252. See also M.S.A. 15.2299(57), M.C.L.A. § 388.717, \nproviding in certain instances for reorganization of school districts. \n\"14. State officials, including all of the defendants, are charged under the Michigan constitution with \nthe duty of providing pupils an education without discrimination with respect to race. Art. VIII, § 2, \nMich. Constitution of 1963. Art. I, § 2, of the constitution provides: \n`No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the \nenjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of \nreligion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate \nlegislation.'\" 338 F.Supp. at 593-594. \nSome of the evidence in this record supporting the District Judge's findings of State acts which \ndiscriminatorily affected the Detroit Board of Education and contributed to pupil segregation follows. \nThe State statutory scheme of support of transportation for school children directly discriminated \nagainst Detroit. Dr. John W. Porter, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Michigan, \ntestified as to the State transportation aid formula: \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas) Dr. Porter, does the State pay the cost of pupil transportation in the State of \nMichigan? \n\"A. The State pays roughly 75 percent of the cost. Last year the appropriation was $29 million. \n\"Q. Do you know what percent of the school children in the State of Michigan are transported to the \nschool at public expense? \n\"A. Yes, I do. 40 percent of all students in Michigan are transported. That equates out to about \n833,000 students last year. \n\n\"Q. Dr. Porter, is there some formula in terms of distance which makes a child eligible for \ntransportation that would be aided by the state? \n\"A. Yes. It is a very complicated formula that 197 computations, and we are in the process right now \nof reducing this — \n\"Q. (Interposing) You mean the financial formula is complicated. But, in terms of distance from his \nhome to the school — \n\"A. A mile and a half outside the city limits. Until this year the legislature amended the Act based \nupon the recommendations of the State Board of Education to allow for in-city transportation which \nwe had never had before. The legislature did not appropriate funds for that. So, now the funds that \nare now used are basically for rural areas and suburban areas where the students live a mile and a \nhalf from the school. \n\"Q. When you say `city,' is there some limitation? For instance, would Grosse Pointe, Harper Woods, \nareas like that that surround the City of Detroit, are they eligible for transportation? \n\"A. In the in-city. But, if the students come across the city boundary 241*241lines they live more than \na mile and a half, which is quite prevalent throughout the state, then they are eligible for the funds. \n\"Q. Well, I think my question may have been confusing. Is there some type of city — is it just any \nplace incorporated as a city that is differentiated from the rural areas, or certain cities eligible for this \nstate aid at the present time and receive the funds — \n\"THE COURT: I think what Mr. Lucas is trying to get at is whether under the old practice whether any \ncity has ceased state aid for transportation within the city. \n\"A. Yes, we have a number of instances where the city would be receiving aid for transportation, \nbecause the law says that if the bus in order to get the students to the school crosses outside of the \ncity boundary, the city is then eligible for aid, and we, and we have a number of instances where that \nexists. \n\"THE COURT: In other words, where the student originates his ride outside the city limits \ntransportation is assisted? \n\"A. That's right, or where the student lives in the city but the bus has to go outside of the city and \ncome back he is also eligible. This, however, does not negate local city officials, school board \nofficials from providing transportation. There is no prohibition against that. \n\"Q. (By Mr. Lucas) You said the legislature changed the law but didn't provide the money. Now, they \nare eligible for state aid but it is unfunded now, is that what you are saying? \n\"A. The law was changed last year to permit in-city bus transportation but in changing the law the \nlegislature said our department had to disburse the funds to the eligible existing areas which meant \nthat since they did not increase the amount of funds appropriated we could not provide for in-city \ntransportation. \n\"Q. If a child lives in the city and lives more than a mile and a half from the school to which he is \nassigned he may not receive the state aid because it is unfunded at the present time? \n\"A. That is correct. \n\"Q. But if he lives the same distance away and lived outside the City of Detroit, for example, then he \ncould receive state aide? \n\"A. That is correct, or any other area.\" \nThe clearest example of direct State participation in encouraging the segregated condition of Detroit \npublic schools, however, is that of school construction in Detroit and the surrounding suburban \nareas. Until 1962 the State Board of Education had direct statutory control over site planning for new \nschool construction. During that time, as was pointed out above, the State approved school \nconstruction which fostered segregation throughout the Detroit Metropolitan area. (See supra pp. \n235-239). Since 1962 the State Board has continued to be involved in approval of school \nconstruction plans. \nIV. Conclusion as to Constitutional Violations \n\nThe discriminatory practices on the part of the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan \nrevealed by this record are significant, pervasive and causally related to the substantial amount of \nsegregation found in the Detroit school system by the District Judge. \nThere is, of course, a significant distinction between this record and those school segregation cases \nwhich have flooded the courts since Brown v. Topeka, infra. This distinction is that Michigan has \nnever enforced segregation by State laws which provided for separate black and white school \nsystems, as was the pattern prior to 1954 in many other States. As a consequence, there always \nhave been some instances of actual school integration in Detroit and still more instances of token \nschool integration. \n242*242 Defendants seek to insulate themselves from remedial action by federal courts by pointing \nto the long standing public policy of Michigan, as expressed in its statutes, of integration of public \neducation. However, this court is not blind to the fact that governments can act only through the \nconduct of their officials and employees and that unconstitutional actions of individuals can be \nredressed. See, e. g., Clemons v. Board of Education, 228 F.2d 853 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. \n1006, 76 S.Ct. 651, 100 L.Ed. 868 (1956). \nThe record in this case amply supports the findings of the District Court of unconstitutional actions by \npublic officials at both the local and State level. \nHistorically de jure segregation has come about through statutory command explicitly establishing \ndual school systems. Michigan's declared public policy is urged as a controlling distinction. No \nmatter how important this distinction may be, it does not in our judgment negate the de jure \nsegregation findings entered in this case by the District Judge. As said in United States v. The Board \nof School Commissioners of the City of Indianapolis, 474 F.2d 81, 83 (7th Cir. 1973): \"[T]he actions \nof the Board of School Commissioners and its duly-appointed representatives and agents may be \nsufficient to constitute de jure segregation without being based on a state law, or even if they are in \nderogation of state law forbidding segregation.\" \nThe record contains substantial evidence to support the finding of the District Court that the \nsegregation of the Detroit public schools, however rooted in private residential segregation, also was \nvalidated and augmented by the Detroit Board of Education and Michigan State Board action of \npervasive influence through the system. Even if the segregation practices were a bit more subtle \nthan the compulsory segregation statutes of Southern States, they were nonetheless effective. \nIt is our view that the findings of fact pertaining to actions of the Detroit Board of Education and the \nState of Michigan which caused or contributed to Detroit school segregation are not clearly \nerroneous and that the District Court was therefore authorized and required to take effective \nmeasures to desegregate the Detroit Public School System. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka \n[I], 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954); Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka [II], 349 \nU.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, \n402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed.2d 554 (1971); Davis v. Board of Commissioners, 402 U.S. 33, \n91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). \nThis record contains a substantial volume of testimony concerning local and State action and \npolicies which helped produce residential segregation in Detroit and in the metropolitan area of \nDetroit. In affirming the District Judge's findings of constitutional violations by the Detroit Board of \nEducation and by the State defendants resulting in segregated schools in Detroit, we have not relied \nat all upon testimony pertaining to segregated housing except as school construction programs \nhelped cause or maintain such segregation. \n\nV. The District Court's Ruling that no Detroit Only \nDesegregation Plan is Possible \nSubsequent to the entry of its findings of constitutional violations on the part of the Detroit Board of \nEducation and the State of Michigan resulting in system-wide segregation of Detroit public schools, \nthe District Court requested plans for Detroit only desegregation. His findings of fact pertaining to \nthese plans warrant repetition: \n\"FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW ON DETROITONLY PLANS OF \nDESEGREGATION \n\"In accordance with orders of the court defendant Detroit Board of Education 243*243submitted two \nplans, limited to the corporate limits of the city, for desegregation of the public schools of the City of \nDetroit, which we will refer to as Plan A and Plan C; plaintiffs submitted a similarly limited plan, which \nwill be referred to as the Foster Plan. Hearings were had on said plans on March 14, 15, 16, 17 and \n21, 1972. In considering these plans the court does not limit itself to the proofs offered at the hearing \njust concluded; it considers as part of the evidence bearing on the issue (i. e., City-Only Plans) all \nproofs submitted in the case to this point, and it specifically incorporates herein by reference the \nFindings and Conclusions contained in its \"Ruling on Issue of Segregation,\" filed September 27, \n1971. \n\"The court makes the following factual findings: \n\"PLAN A. \n\"1. The court finds that this plan is an elaboration and extension of the so-called Magnet Plan, \npreviously authorized for implementation as an interim plan pending hearing and determination on \nthe issue of segregation. \n\"2. As proposed we find, at the high school level, that it offers a greater and wider degree of \nspecialization, but any hope that it would be effective to desegregate the public schools of the City of \nDetroit at that level is virtually ruled out by the failure of the current model to achieve any appreciable \nsuccess. \n\"3. We find, at the Middle School level, that the expanded model would affect, directly, about 24,000 \npupils of a total of 140,000 in the grades covered; and its effect would be to set up a school system \nwithin the school system, and would intensify the segregation in schools not included in the Middle \nSchool program. In this sense, it would increase segregation. \n\"4. As conceded by its author, Plan A is neither a desegregation nor an integration plan. \n\"PLAN C. \n\"1. The court finds that Plan C is a token or part-time desegregation effort. \n\"2. We find that this plan covers only a portion of the grades and would leave the base schools no \nless racially identifiable. \n\n\"PLAINTIFFS' PLAN \n\"1. The court finds that Plaintiffs' Plan would accomplish more desegregation than now obtains in the \nsystem, or would be achieved under Plan A or Plan C. \n\"2. We find further that the racial composition of the student body is such that the plan's \nimplementation would clearly make the entire Detroit public school system racially identifiable as \nBlack. \n\"3. The plan would require the development of transportation on a vast scale which, according to the \nevidence, could not be furnished, ready for operation by the opening of the 1972-73 school year. \nThe plan contemplates the transportation of 82,000 pupils and would require the acquisition of some \n900 vehicles, the hiring and training of a great number of drivers, the procurement of space for \nstorage and maintenance, the recruitment of maintenance and the not negligible task of designing a \ntransportation system to service the schools. \n\"4. The plan would entail an overall recasting of the Detroit school system, when there is little \nassurance that it would not have to undergo another reorganization if a metropolitan plan is adopted. \n\"5. It would involve the expenditure of vast sums of money and effort which would be wasted or lost. \n\"6. The plan does not lend itself as a building block for a metropolitan plan. \n\"7. The plan would make the Detroit school system more identifiably Black, 244*244 and leave many \nof its schools 75 to 90 per cent Black. \n\"8. It would change a school system which is now Black and White to one that would be perceived \nas Black, thereby increasing the flight of Whites from the city and the system, thereby increasing the \nBlack student population. \n\"9. It would subject the students and parents, faculty and administration, to the trauma of \nreassignments, with little likelihood that such reassignments would continue for any appreciable \ntime. \n\"In summary, we find that none of the three plans would result in the desegregation of the public \nschools of the Detroit school district. \n\"CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n\"1. The court has continuing jurisdiction of this action for all purposes, including the granting of \neffective relief. See Ruling on Issue of Segregation, September 27, 1971. \n\"2. On the basis of the court's finding of illegal school segregation, the obligation of the school \ndefendants is to adopt and implement an educationally sound, practicable plan of desegregation that \npromises realistically to achieve now and hereafter the greatest possible degree of actual school \ndesegregation. Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, [88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d \n716;] Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, [90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d \n19;] Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290, [90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d \n477;] Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, [91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed.2d \n554.] \n\n\"3. Detroit Board of Education Plans A and C are legally insufficient because they do not promise to \neffect significant desegregation. Green v. County School Board, supra, at 439-440, 88 S.Ct. 1689. \n\"4. Plaintiffs' Plan, while it would provide a racial mix more in keeping with the Black-White \nproportions of the student population than under either of the Board's plans or as the system now \nstands, would accentuate the racial identifiability of the district as a Black school system, and would \nnot accomplish desegregation. \n\"5. The conclusion, under the evidence in this case, is inescapable that relief of segregation in the \npublic schools of the City of Detroit cannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits \nof the city. The State, however, cannot escape its constitutional duty to desegregate the public \nschools of the City of Detroit by pleading local authority. \n* * * * * * \n\"School district lines are simply matters of political convenience and may not be used to deny \nconstitutional rights. If the boundary lines of the school districts of the City of Detroit and the \nsurrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that they could not withstand constitutional \nchallenge. In seeking for solutions to the problem of school segregation, other federal courts have \nnot \"treated as immune from intervention the administrative structure of a state's educational system, \nto the extent that it affects the capacity to desegregate. Geographically or administratively \nindependent units have been compelled to merge or to initiate or continue cooperative operation as \na single system for school desegregation purposes.\"1 \n\"That the court must look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem \nof segregation in the Detroit public schools is obvious; that it has the authority, nay more, the duty to \n(under the circumstances of this case) do so appears plainly anticipated by Brown II,2 seventeen \nyears ago. While other school cases have not had to deal with our exact situation,3 the \nlogic 245*245 of their application of the command of Brown II supports our view of our duty. \n\"FOOTNOTES \n\"1.

Bossier Parish School Board, 446 F.2d 911 (5th Cir. 1971).\" \nThe District Judge's finding that no Detroit only plan can achieve desegregation of the Detroit public \nschool system points up another substantial distinction between this case and the classical school \nsegregation case. This record presents a wholly new fact pattern in a school segregation case so far \nas this Circuit is concerned. This court never before has been confronted by a finding that any less \ncomprehensive a solution than a metropolitan area plan would result in an all black school system \n\nimmediately surrounded by practically all white suburban school systems, with an overwhelmingly \nwhite majority population in the total metropolitan area. \nRelevant to and supportive of the District Judge's findings are these school census figures showing \ntrends toward segregation in the Detroit schools during the last decade: \n  1960      100 of 251 schools were 90% \n            or more white \n \n            71 of 251 schools were 90% \n            or more black \n \n            68% of all schools were 90% \n            or more one race. \n \n  1970      69 of 282 schools were 90% \n            or more white \n \n            133 of 282 schools were 90% \n            or more black \n \n            71.6% of all schools were \n            90% or more one race. \n \n  1960-61   65.8% of the total number \n            of black students in regular \n            schools were 90% or more \n            black schools. \n \n  1970-71   74.9% of the total number \n            of black students in regular \n            schools were in 90% or \n            more black schools. \nThis record reflects a present and expanding pattern of all black schools in Detroit (resulting in part \nfrom State action) separated only by school district boundaries from nearby all white schools. We \ncannot see how such segregation can be any less harmful to the minority students than if the same \nresult were accomplished within one school district. \nThe boundaries of the Detroit school district are identical to the geographical boundaries of the City \nof Detroit. This means that the Detroit school district, like the City, contains within its boundaries two \nentirely separate cites (and school districts), Hamtramck and Highland Park, and surrounds a third \nCity (and school district), Dearborn, on three sides. Immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the \nDetroit school district are seventeen school districts. An overwhelming majority of these districts, \nother than Detroit, Highland Park, River Rouge and Hamtramck, are entirely white or contain only a \ntoken number of black students. \nLike the District Judge, we see no validity to an argument which asserts that the constitutional right \nto equality before the law is hemmed in by the boundaries of a school district. \nA. Status of School Districts under Michigan Law \n\nThis conclusion is supported by the status of school districts under Michigan law and by the historial \ncontrol exercised over local school districts by the legislature of Michigan and by \nState 246*246 agencies and officials, which we now discuss. \nAs held by the District Court, it is well established under the Constitution and laws of Michigan that \nthe public school system is a State function and that local school districts are instrumentalities of the \nState created for administrative convenience. \nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 governing the Territory of Michigan provided: \n\"Religion, morality and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of \nmankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" Art. III. \nWith this genesis, Michigan's four Constitutions have clearly established that the public school \nsystem in that State is solely a State function. The Constitution of 1835 in Article X, Section 3, \nprovided, in part: \"The legislature shall provide for a system of common schools . . .\" The \nConstitution of 1850, Article XIII, Section 4, provided, in part: \"The legislature shall . . . provide for \nand establish a system of primary schools . . .\" Section 1 of the same Article provided, \". . . the \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction shall have general supervision of public instruction . . .\" \nThe Constitution of 1908 in Article XI, Section 2, provided that the Superintendent of Public \nInstruction \"shall have general supervision of public instruction in the State.\" Article XI, Section 9, \nprovided, in part as follows: \n\"The legislature shall continue a system of primary schools, whereby every school district in the \nState shall provide for the education of pupils without charge for tuition . . .\" \nThe Constitution of 1963, the present Constitution of the State of Michigan, in Article VIII, Section 2, \nprovides, in part as follows: \n\"The legislature shall maintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary \nschools as defined by law.\" \nIn interpreting the above educational provisions of the Constitution of 1850, the Michigan Supreme \nCourt stated: \"The school district is a state agency. Moreover, it is of legislative creation . . \n.\" Attorney General v. Lowrey, 131 Mich. 639, 644, 92 N.W. 289, 290 (1902). Again, interpreting the \nConstitution of 1850, the Supreme Court of Michigan in Attorney General v. Detroit Board of \nEducation, 154 Mich. 584, 590, 118 N.W. 606, 609 (1908),adopted lower court language which read: \n\"Education in Michigan belongs to the state. It is no part of the local self-government inherent in the \ntownship or municipality, except so far as the Legislature may choose to make it such. The \nConstitution has turned the whole subject over to the Legislature . . .\" \nThe Supreme Court of Michigan interpreted Article XI, Section 9, of the Constitution of 1908 to \nmean: \n\"The Legislature has entire control over the schools of the state subject only to the provisions above \nreferred to. The division of the territory of the state into districts, the conduct of the school, the \nqualifications of teachers, the subjects to be taught therein, are all within its control.\" Child Welfare v. \nKennedy School Dist., 220 Mich. 290, 296, 189 N.W. 1002, 1004 (1922). \n\nIn the leading case concerning construction of this section of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, the \nMichigan Supreme Court said: \n\"It is the responsibility of the state board of education to supervise the system of free public schools \nset up by the legislature and, as a part of that responsibility, to promulgate regulations specifying the \nnumber of hours necessary to constitute a school day for elementary school students as well as for \nother classifications or groupings of students, to determine the curricula and, in general, to exercise \nleadership 247*247 and supervision over the public school system.\" Welling v. Livonia Board of \nEducation, 382 Mich. 620, 624, 171 N.W.2d 545, 546 (1969). See also Governor v. State Treasurer, \n389 Mich. 1, 13, 203 N.W.2d 457 (1972). \nMichigan has not treated its school districts as sacrosanct. To the contrary, Michigan always has \nregarded education as the fundamental business of the State as a whole. Local school districts are \ncreatures of the State and act as instrumentalities of the State under State control. Cf. Senghas v. \nL'Anse Creuse Public Schools, 368 Mich. 557, 118 N.W.2d 975 (1962); McLaughlin v. Board of \nEducation, 255 Mich. 667, 239 N.W. 374 (1931). \nThe record discloses a number of examples of State control over local public education in Michigan. \n1. Following the holding of Welling v. Livonia Board of Education, supra, that there was no minimum \nlength of day required under the 180-day school attendance rule absent a State Board of Education \nregulation, the Michigan State Board of Education, acting under its Constitutional mandate without \nlegislative authority, established an administrative rule requiring local school boards to provide a \nminimum number of hours per school year. See, School Districts Child Account for Distribution of \nState Aid, Bulletin No. 1005, Michigan State Department of Education (1970). \n2. Public Act 289 of 1964 (M.S.A. § 15.2299(1) et seq., M.C.L.A. § 388.681 et seq.) required \nMichigan school districts to operate K-12 systems. When Public Act 289 became effective, 1,438 \npublic school districts existed in Michigan. By the beginning of 1968, this figure had been reduced to \n738, meaning that 700 school districts in Michigan have disappeared since 1964 through \nreorganization. Annual Report, Committee on School District Reorganization, 1968 Journal of the \nSenate 422-423 (March 1, 1968). \n3. Pursuant to Act 289 of 1964, supra, the State Board of Education ordered the merger of the \nBrownstown No. 10, Hand, Maple Grove and Carson school districts, all in Wayne County. The \naction is best explained by the fact that Brownstown was, at that time, the wealthiest school district \nin the State, indeed, with a property valuation of $340,000 backing each child, perhaps the \nwealthiest district in the nation, while the other three districts were extremely poor. \n4. When the Sumpter School District was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1968, the State Board of \nEducation, acting under Public Act 239 of 1967 (M.S.A. § 15.2299(51) et seq., M.C.L.A. § 388.711 et \nseq.), merged the district with four adjoining districts, including the Airport School District. \nSignificantly, though Sumpter was in Wayne County, Airport was in Monroe County, showing that \ncounty lines are not inviolate in Michigan. \n5. The Nankin Mills School District in Wayne County was beset with financial problems and had no \nhigh school. Again, pursuant to Act 239, the State Board of Education in 1969 ordered this school \ndistrict to merge with the Livonia, Garden City and Wayne Community schools. \n6. When the Inkster School District in Wayne County was on the verge of financial bankruptcy, the \nMichigan legislature passed Public Act 32 of 1968 (M.S.A. § 15.1916 et seq., M.C.L.A. § 388.201 et \nseq.) enabling the district to borrow $705,000 but on the condition that if the district could not \n\nbalance its budget, the State Board of Education could reorganize, merge or annex the district. The \nlegislative history of Act 32 indicates at least two legislators voted against the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives because of the excessive control given to the State Board of Education: \n\"I voted No on House Bill No. 3332 because in setting up the machinery to bail out distressed \ndistricts, it takes from the local communities the control over their own educational system \nby 248*248 providing for excessive arbitrary reorganization powers in the hands of the Board of \nEducation . . .\" \n\"This bill certainly sets up the State Board of Education to be a dictator of all school districts that run \ninto financial problems.\" 1968 Journal of the House of Representatives 1965. \n7. Too small and too poor to operate a high school, the all-black Carver School District in suburban \nOakland County reached a crisis in 1960 when other surrounding white districts refused to accept \nCarver pupils on a tuition basis. The Carver district was merged with Oak Park. \n8. The State Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction may withhold State aid for \nfailure to operate the minimum school year. M.S.A. § 15.3575, M.C.L.A. § 340.575. In 1970, funds \nwere withheld from the City of Grand Rapids School District. 17 Michigan School Board Journal 3 \n(March, 1970). For Attorney General Opinions holding that State aid may be withheld by the State \nBoard of Education from school districts for hiring uncertified teachers, defaulting on State loans and \nfor other reasons, see Op.Atty.Gen. No. 880, 1949-1950 Report of the Attorney General 104 \n(January 24, 1949, Roth); No. 2333, 1955 Report of the Attorney General 561 (October 20, 1955, \nKavanaugh); No. 4097, 1961-1962 Report of the Attorney General 553 (October 8, 1962, Kelley). \n9. The State of Michigan contributes, on the average, 34% of the operating budgets of the 54 school \ndistricts included in the proposed Metropolitan Plan of Integration. In eleven of the 54 districts, the \nState's contribution exceeds 50% and in eight more, it exceeds 40%. State aid is appropriated from \nthe General Fund, revenue raised through state-wide taxation, and is distributed annually to the local \nschool districts under a formula devised by the legislature. See, e. g., Public Act 134 (1971), M.S.A. \n§ 15.1919(51), M.C.L.A. § 388.611. \nThough the local school districts obtain funds from the assessment of local property, the ultimate \nauthority in insuring equalized property valuations throughout the State is the State Tax \nCommission. M.S.A. § 7.631 et seq., M. C.L.A. § 209.101 et seq.; M.S.A. § 7.206, M.C.L.A. § \n211.148; M.S.A. § 7.52, M.C.L.A. § 211.34. The State's duty to equalize is required by the Michigan \nConstitution, Article IX, Section 3. This \"State equalized valuation\" serves as the basis for calculating \nlocal revenue yields. See, Ranking of Michigan Public High School — School Districts by Selected \nFinancial Data, 1970, Bulletin 1012, Michigan State Department of Education (1971). \n10. The Michigan School Code reaffirms the ultimate control of the State over public education. \nLocal school districts must observe all State laws relating to schools,[1] hold school a minimum \nnumber of days per year,[2] employ only certified teachers,[3] teach civics, health and physical \neducation and drivers' education,[4] excuse students to attend religious instruction classes,[5] observe \nState requirements when teaching sex education,[6] make annual financial and other reports to the \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction,[7] adopt only textbooks which are listed with the \nSuperintendent 249*249 of Public Instruction[8] and must follow all rules and regulations of the State \nDepartment of Education. \nLocal school districts, unless they have the approval of the State Board of Education or the \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, cannot consolidate with another school district,[9] annex \nterritory,[10] divide or attach parts of other districts,[11] borrow monies in anticipation of State aid,[12] or \nconstruct, reconstruct or remodel school buildings or additions to them.[13] \n\nThe power to withhold State aid, of course, effects enormous leverage upon any local school district, \nsince on the average 34 per cent of the operation budget of the 54 school districts included in the \nproposed Metropolitan Plan is paid for by the State. \nIn the instance of the City of Detroit, the State exhibited its understanding of its power over the local \nschool district by the adoption of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 which repealed a high school \ndesegregation plan previously adopted by the Detroit Board of Education. See 433 F.2d 897. \nB. De Jure Acts of Segregation \nThus, the record establishes that the State has committed de jure acts of segregation and that the \nState controls the instrumentalities whose action is necessary to remedy the harmful effects of the \nState acts. There can be little doubt that a federal court has both the power and the duty to effect a \nfeasible desegregation plan. Indeed, such is the essence of Brown II. Brown v. Board of Education, \n349 U.S. 294, 300-301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955). In the instant case the only feasible \ndesegregation plan involves the crossing of the boundary lines between the Detroit School District \nand adjacent or nearby school districts for the limited purpose of providing an effective \ndesegregation plan. The power to disregard such artificial barriers is all the more clear where, as \nhere, the State has been guilty of discrimination which had the effect of creating and maintaining \nracial segregation along school district lines. See Section III B, pp. 238-241, supra. United States v. \nScotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright \nv. City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 463, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972); United States v. State of \nTexas, 447 F.2d 441, 443-444 (5th Cir. 1971); Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier \nCounty, 429 F.2d 364, 368 (8th Cir. 1970). See also Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, 402 \nU.S. 33, 36-38, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). \nThere exists, however, an even more compelling basis for the District Court's crossing artificial \nboundary lines to cure the State's constitutional violations. The instant case calls up haunting \nmemories of the now long overruled and discredited \"separate but equal doctrine\" of Plessy v. \nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896). If we hold that school district \nboundaries are absolute barriers to a Detroit school desegregation plan, we would be opening a way \nto nullify Brown v. Board of Education which overruled Plessy, supra. \nThis court in considering this record finds it impossible to declare \"clearly erroneous\" the District \nJudge's conclusion that any Detroit only desegregation plan will lead directly to a single segregated \nDetroit school district overwhelmingly black in all of its schools, surrounded by a ring of suburbs and \nsuburban school districts overwhelmingly white in composition in a State in which the racial \ncomposition is 87 per cent white and 13 per cent black. \n250*250 We deal with a record which demonstrates more than ample support for the District Judge's \nfindings of unconstitutional segregation by race resulting in major part from action and inaction of \npublic authorities, both local and State. This segregation is found in the school system of the inner \ncity of a metropolitan area 81% white against 19% nonwhite. Under this record a remedial order of a \ncourt of equity which left the Detroit school system overwhelmingly black (for the foreseeable future) \nsurrounded by suburban school systems overwhelmingly white cannot correct the constitutional \nviolations herein found. \nVI. The District Judge's Order to Prepare A \nMetropolitan Area Desegregation Plan \n\nThe third major issue in this case pertains to the validity of the District Judge's ruling on \ndesegregation area and order for development of a plan of desegregation dated June 14, 1972, \naccompanied by a statement of findings of facts and conclusions of law in support thereof, reported \nat 345 F.Supp. 914. \nAt the outset it is obvious from what we have said pertaining to the inadequacy of any Detroit only \ndesegregation plan that this court feels that some plan for desegregation beyond the boundaries of \nthe Detroit School District is both within the equity powers of the District Court and essential to a \nsolution of this problem. We reiterate this, keeping in mind the admonition from Chief Justice \nMarshall: \n\"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not \nof men. It will certainly case to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the \nviolation of a vested legal right.\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). \nWe reject the contention that school district lines are sacrosanct and that the jurisdiction of the \nDistrict Court to grant equitable relief in the present case is limited to the geographical boundaries of \nDetroit. We reiterate that school districts and school boards are instrumentalities of the \nState. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L. Ed.2d 5 (1958). As early as Brown \nII the Supreme Court pointed out that: \n\"[T]he courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of \nthe school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and \nattendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public \nschools on a nonracial basis, . . .\" 349 U.S. at 300-301, 75 S.Ct. at 756. \nThe Supreme Court has held that school boundary lines cannot be changed or new school systems \ncreated where the result is a larger imbalance in racial ratios in school systems where all vestiges of \nenforced racial segregation have not been eliminated. United States v. Scotland Neck Board of \nEducation, 407 U.S. 484, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright v. Council of the City of \nEmporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972). This is true regardless of \"dominant \npurpose.\" Wright v. City of Emporia, 407 U.S. at 462, 92 S.Ct. 2196. \nIf school boundary lines cannot be changed for an unconstitutional purpose, it follows logically that \nexisting boundary lines cannot be frozen for an unconstitutional purpose. \nWe therefore conclude that the District Court in the present case is not confined to the boundary \nlines of Detroit in fashioning equitable relief. \nBradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by an equally \ndivided court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (1973), is distinguishable in several \nrespects. In that case the District Court ordered an actual consolidation of three separate school \ndistricts, all of which the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared to be unitary. 251*251 In the \ninstant case the District Court has not ordered consolidation of school districts, but directed a study \nof plans for the reassignment of pupils in school districts comprising the metropolitan area of Detroit. \nIn the Richmond case the court found that neither the Constitution nor statutes of Virginia, previously \nor presently in effect, would have permitted the State Board of Education, acting alone, to have \neffected a consolidation of the three school districts into a single system under the control of a single \nschool board. The Fourth Circuit held that compulsory consolidation of political subdivisions of the \nState of Virginia was beyond the power of a federal court because of the Tenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. The decisions which now are under review did not contemplate \nsuch a restructuring. \n\nFurthermore, the court in the Richmond case cited provisions of the Constitution and statutes of \nVirginia in support of its holding that — \n\"The power to operate, maintain and supervise public schools in Virginia is, and always has been, \nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the local school boards and not within the jurisdiction of the State \nBoard of Education.\" 462 F.2d at 1067. \nThe record in the present case amply supports the finding that the State of Michigan has not been \nsubject to such limitations in its dealings with local school boards. \nVII. Rights of Other School Districts To Be Made \nParties and To Be Heard \nIn his \"Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy\" the District Court defined the \nmetropolitan area \"for the present purposes\" to comprise the three counties of Wayne, Oakland and \nMacomb. In his \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in Support of Ruling on Desegregation \nArea and Development Plans\" the District Court noted that \"the court has taken no proofs with \nrespect to the establishment of the boundaries in the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb.\" In \nhis \"Ruling on Desegregation Area and Order for Development of Plan of Desegregation,\" the \nDistrict Court defined the desegregation area to include some 53 school districts. Certain of these \nschool districts have intervened in this case, but have not yet been afforded an opportunity to offer \nproof. Some of the other school districts are not parties to the litigation. \nIn United States v. Texas Education Agency, 467 F.2d 848, 873 (5th Cir. 1972), the Court said: \n\"The discriminatory acts of the school authorities infect the entire school system; they are particularly \nobvious in the so-called `pockets'. Some schools may be the `result' of state-imposed segregation \neven though no specific discriminatory school board action may be shown as to those schools. Had \nthe school authorities not specifically segregated the minority students in certain schools other \nschools may have developed as desegregated facilities. Thus, though they may not be `pockets of \ndiscrimination', these schools are the `results' of discrimination.\" \nUnder the authorities heretofore discussed, these school districts are arms and instrumentalities of \nthe State of Michigan. Nevertheless, under Michigan law, they may sue and be sued. See M.S.A. §§ \n15.3154, 15.3192, M.C. L.A. §§ 340.154, 340.192. \nRule 19, Fed.R.Civ.P., provides that a person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as \na party to the action if \"in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already \nparties.\" Under this rule joinder of necessary parties is required if jurisdiction over them can be \nobtained and if joinder will not defeat federal jurisdiction of the case. \nWe hold that school districts which are to be affected by the decree of the District Court are \n\"necessary parties\" under Rule 19. As a prerequisite 252*252 to the implementation of a plan in this \ncase affecting any school district, the affected district first must be made a party to this litigation and \nafforded an opportunity to be heard. \nWhile agreeing with the District Court in its conclusion that it can consider a metropolitan remedy, we \nexpress no views as to the desegregation area set forth in the orders of the District Court. \n\nWe vacate the order of March 24, 1972, entitled \"Ruling on Propriety of a Metropolitan Remedy to \nAccomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools of Detroit.\" \nThis Court recognizes that, as set forth above, the legislature of the State of Michigan has power to \nprovide a complete remedy for the unconstitutional segregation disclosed in this record. It, too, has \nresponsibility for following the great mandates of the United States Constitution. \nIf, however, the legislature fails to act, or it it acts in a manner inconsistent with the expeditious and \nefficient elimination of the unconstitutional practices and conditions described in this opinion, the \nDistrict Court shall proceed to fashion such a remedy, including an interim remedy if found to be \nnecessary, as it shall determine to be appropriate within the guidelines of this opinion. \nOn remand, any party against whom relief is sought, including school districts which heretofore have \nintervened and school districts which hereafter may become parties to this litigation, shall be \nafforded an opportunity to offer additional evidence, and to cross-examine available witnesses who \npreviously have testified, on any issue raised by the pleadings, including amendments thereto, as \nmay be relevant and admissible to such issues. The District Court may consider any evidence now \non file and such additional competent evidence as may be introduced by any party. However, the \nDistrict Court will not be required to receive any additional evidence as to the matters contained in its \nRuling on the Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, and reported at 338 F. Supp. 582, or \nits Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on the \"Detroit-only\" plans of desegregation, dated \nMarch 28, 1972. We hold that the findings of fact contained in these rulings are not clearly \nerroneous, Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., but to the contrary are supported by substantial evidence. \nUpon remand, the plaintiffs and other parties shall be permitted to amend their pleadings to conform \nto the evidence (see Rule 15(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.), to add additional parties and to ask for any additional \nappropriate relief, the details of such amendments to be under the continuing supervision of the \nDistrict Court. \nWe also vacate the District Court's Ruling on Desegregation Area and Development Plan, dated \nJune 14, 1972, reported at 345 F.Supp. 914, except those parts of the order appointing a panel \ncharged with the duty of preparing interim and final plans of desegregation. The panel appointed by \nthe District Court is authorized to proceed with its studies and planning under the direction of the \nDistrict Court. Pending further orders of the District Court or this Court, the defendants and school \ndistricts involved will continue to supply administrative and staff assistance to the panel upon its \nrequest. Until further order of the court, the reasonable costs incurred by the panel will be paid as \nprovided by the District Court's order of June 14, 1972. \nThe order of the District Court directing the purchase of school buses, dated July 11, 1972, also is \nvacated, subject to the right of the District Court, in its discretion, to consider the entry of another \norder requiring the purchase of school buses at the appropriate time. \nVIII. Equitable Relief \nIn this opinion we have emphasized the broad powers of a District Court to fashion equitable relief in \nschool desegregation cases. For the 253*253 guidance of the District Court on remand, we now \nreview the decisions on this subject in further depth. \n1) The Fundamental Constitutional Holding: \n\n\"We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. \nSeparate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation \ncomplained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 692, 98 L.Ed. 873 \n(1954). \n2) The Supreme Court's Initial Description of the Equitable Remedy: \n\"In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. \nTraditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies4 and by \na facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.5 These cases call for the exercise of \nthese traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in \nadmission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis. To effectuate this \ninterest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems \noperated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision. \nCourts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such \nobstacles in a systematic and effective manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of \nthese constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. \n4 See Alexander v. Hillman, 296 U.S. 222, 239, 56 S.Ct. 204, 80 L.Ed. 192. \n5 See Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754. \n\"While giving weight to these public and private considerations, the courts will require that the \ndefendants make a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with our May 17, 1954, \nruling. Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to \ncarry out the ruling in an effective manner. The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that \nsuch time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the \nearliest practicable date. To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, \narising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, \nrevision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of \ndetermining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and \nregulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems. They will also consider the \nadequacy of any plans the defendants may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate a \ntransition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system. During this period of transition, the courts \nwill retain jurisdiction of these cases.\" Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka [II], 349 U.S. 294, 300-\n301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955). \n3) Delay Is No Longer Tolerable: \n\"In determining whether respondent School Board met that command by adopting its `freedom-of-\nchoice' plan, it is relevant that this first step did not come until some 11 years after Brown I was \ndecided and 10 years after Brown II directed the making of a `prompt and reasonable start.' This \ndeliberate perpetuation of the unconstitutional dual system can only have compounded the harm of \nsuch a system. Such delays are no longer tolerable, for `the governing constitutional principles no \nlonger bear the imprint of newly enunciated doctrine.' Watson v. City of \nMemphis, supra,373 254*254 U.S. at 529, 83 S.Ct. 1314, 10 L.Ed. 2d 529; see Bradley v. School \nBoard, supra; Rogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198, 86 S.Ct. 358, 15 L.Ed.2d 265. Moreover, a plan that at \nthis late date fails to provide meaningful assurance of prompt and effective disestablishment of a \ndual system is also intolerable. `The time for mere \"deliberate speed\" has run out,' Griffin v. County \nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218, 234, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256; `the context in which we must \ninterpret and apply this language [of Brown II] to plans for desegregation has been significantly \naltered.' Goss v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683, 689, 83 S.Ct. 1405, 10 L.Ed.2d 632. \n\nSee Calhoun v. Latimer, 377 U.S. 263, 84 S.Ct. 1235, 12 L.Ed.2d 288. The burden on a school \nboard today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises \nrealistically to work now.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 438-439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, \n1694, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968) (Emphasis added.) \n4) State Imposed Segregation Must be Completely Removed at Earliest Practicable Date: \n\"The obligation of the district courts, as it always has been, is to assess the effectiveness of a \nproposed plan in achieving desegregation. There is no universal answer to complex problems of \ndesegregation; there is obviously no one plan that will do the job in every case. The matter must be \nassessed in light of the circumstances present and the options available in each instance. It is \nincumbent upon the school board to establish that its proposed plan promises meaningful and \nimmediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segregation. It is incumbent upon the \ndistrict court to weight that claim in light of the facts at hand and in light of any alternatives which \nmay be shown as feasible and more promising in their effectiveness. Where the court finds the \nboard to be acting in good faith and the proposed plan to have real prospects for dismantling the \nstate-imposed dual system `at the earliest practicable date,' then the plan may be said to provide \neffective relief. Of course, the availability to the board of other more promising courses of action may \nindicate a lack of good faith; and at the least it places a heavy burden upon the board to explain its \npreference for an apparently less effective method. Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will require \nevaluation in practice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed \nsegregation has been completely removed. See No. 805, Raney v. Board of Education, post, 391 \nU.S. 443 at 449, 88 S.Ct. 1697, 20 L.Ed.2d 727.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 439, \n88 S.Ct. 1689, 1695, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968) (Emphasis added.) \n5) The Court Has The Power and The Duty to Eliminate Effects of Past Discrimination: \n\"We bear in mind that the court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will \nso far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in \nthe future.\" Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154, 85 S.Ct. 817, 822, 13 L.Ed.2d 709 (1965). \n(Emphasis added). Compare the remedies discussed in, e. g.,NLRB v. Newport News Shipbuilding \n& Dry Dock Co., 308 U.S. 241, 60 S.Ct. 203, 84 L.Ed. 219 (1939); United States v. Crescent \nAmusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 65 S.Ct. 254, 89 L.Ed. 160 (1944); Standard Oil Co. v. United \nStates, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911). See also Griffin v. County School Board, 377 \nU.S. 218, 232-234, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964). Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. \n430, n. 4 at 438, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968) (relating to the remedial command of Brown \nII). \n6) Resegregation is Impermissible: \n\"Like the transfer provisions held invalid in Goss v. Board of Education, 255*255373 U.S. 683, 686, \n83 S.Ct. 1405, 10 L.Ed.2d 632 `[i]t is readily apparent that the transfer [provision] lends itself to \nperpetuation of segregation.' While we there indicated that `free-transfer' plans under some \ncircumstances might be valid, we explicitly stated that `no official transfer plan or provision of which \nracial segregation is the inevitable consequence may stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.' \nId., at 689, 83 S.Ct. at 1409. So it is here; no attempt has been made to justify the transfer provision \nas a device designed to meet `legitimate local problems,' ibid.; rather it patently operates as a device \nto allow resegregation of the races to the extent desegregation would be achieved by geographically \ndrawn zones. Respondent's argument in this Court reveals its purpose. We are frankly told in the \nBrief that without the transfer option it is apprehended that while students will flee the school system \naltogether. `But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot \n\nbe allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.' Brown II, 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. \nat 756. \n\"We do not hold that `free transfer' can have no place in a desegregation plan. But like `freedom of \nchoice,' if it cannot be shown that such a plan will further rather than delay conversion to a unitary, \nnonracial, nondiscriminatory school system, it must be held unacceptable. See Green v. County \nSchool Board, supra, 391 U.S. at 439-441, 88 S.Ct. 1689. \n\"We conclude, therefore, that the Board `must be required to formulate a new plan and, in light of \nother courses which appear open to the Board, . . . fashion steps which promise realistically to \nconvert promptly to a system without a `white' school and a `Negro' school, but just schools.\" Id., at \n442, 88 S.Ct. 1689. Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U.S. 450, 459-460, 88 S.Ct. 1700, \n1705, 20 L.Ed.2d 733 (1968) (Emphasis added.) \n7) The Remedial Tools: \nIn Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed. 2d 554 (1971), Chief \nJustice Burger, writing for a unanimous Court, said: \n\"If school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under these holdings, judicial authority may \nbe invoked. Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable \npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies. \n`The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould \neach decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished \nit. The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and \nreconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private \nclaims.' Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944), cited \nin Brown II, supra, 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. 753.\" \na) The Flexible Ratio: \n\"As the voluminous record in this case shows, the predicate for the District Court's use of the 71%-\n29% ratio was twofold: first, its express finding, approved by the Court of Appeals and not \nchallenged here, that a dual school system had been maintained by the school authorities at least \nuntil 1969; second, its finding, also approved by the Court of Appeals, that the school board had \ntotally defaulted in its acknowledged duty to come forward with an acceptable plan of its own, \nnotwithstanding the patient efforts of the District Judge who, on at least three occasions, urged the \nboard to submit plans. As the statement of facts shows, these findings are abundantly supported by \nthe 256*256 record. It was because of this total failure of the school board that the District Court was \nobliged to turn to other qualified sources, and Dr. Finger was designated to assist the District Court \nto do what the board should have done. \n\"We see therefore that the use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting point in the \nprocess of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement. From that starting point the \nDistrict Court proceeded to frame a decree that was within its discretionary powers, as an equitable \nremedy for the particular circumstances. As we said in Green, a school authority's remedial plan or a \ndistrict court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effectiveness. Awareness of the racial \ncomposition of the whole school system is likely to be a useful starting point in shaping a remedy to \ncorrect past constitutional violations. In sum, the very limited use made of mathematical ratios was \nwithin the equitable remedial discretion of the District Court.\" Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. \n1, 24-25, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). \nb) Noncontiguous School Zoning: \n\"The maps submitted in these cases graphically demonstrate that one of the principal tools \nemployed by school planners and by courts to break up the dual school system has been a frank — \nand sometimes drastic — gerrymandering of school districts and attendance zones. An additional \nstep was pairing, `clustering,' or `grouping' of schools with attendance assignments made \ndeliberately to accomplish the transfer of Negro students out of formerly segregated Negro schools \nand transfer of white students to formerly all-Negro schools. More often than not, these zones are \n\nneither compact nor contiguous; indeed they may be on opposite ends of the city. As an interim \ncorrective measure, this cannot be said to be beyond the broad remedial powers of a court. \n\"Absent a constitutional violation there would be no basis for judicially ordering assignment of \nstudents on a racial basis. All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be \ndesirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes. But all things are not equal in a system \nthat has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation. The remedy for \nsuch segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some \nsituations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be \navoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual \nschool systems. \n\"No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it \nmust be recognized that there are limits. The objective is to dismantle the dual school system. \n`Racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be \ninadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation \nresulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of school size in order to achieve or \nmaintain an artificial racial separation. When school authorities present a district court with a `loaded \ngame board,' affirmative action in the form of remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to \nachieve truly non-discriminatory assignments. In short, an assignment plan is not acceptable simply \nbecause it appears to be neutral. \n\"In this area, we must of necessity rely to a large extent, as this Court has for more than 16 years, on \nthe informed judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of appeals. \n\"We hold that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school zones is a permissible tool and such \naction is to be considered in light of 257*257 the objectives sought. Judicial steps in shaping such \nzones going beyond combinations of contiguous areas should be examined in light of what is said in \nsubdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this opinion concerning the objectives to be sought. Maps do not tell \nthe whole story since noncontiguous school zones may be more accessible to each other in terms of \nthe critical travel time, because of traffic patterns and good highways, than schools geographically \ncloser together. Conditions in different localities will vary so widely that no rigid rules can be laid \ndown to govern all situations.\" Swann v. Board of Education, supra, at 27-29, 91 S.Ct. at 1281-1282. \n(Emphasis added.) \nc) Transportation of Students: \n\"The scope of permissible transportation of students as an implement of a remedial decree has \nnever been defined by this Court and by the very nature of the problem it cannot be defined with \nprecision. No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite \nvariety of problems presented in thousands of situations. Bus transportation has been an integral \npart of the public education system for years, and was perhaps the single most important factor in \nthe transition from the one-room schoolhouse to the consolidated school. Eighteen million of the \nNation's public school children, approximately 39%, were transported to their schools by bus in \n1969-1970 in all parts of the country. \n\"The importance of bus transportation as a normal and accepted tool of educational policy is readily \ndiscernible in this and the companion case, Davis, supra. The Charlotte school authorities did not \npurport to assign students on the basis of geographically drawn zones until 1965 and then they \nallowed almost unlimited transfer privileges. The District Court's conclusion that assignment of \nchildren to the school nearest their home serving their grade would not produce an effective \ndismantling of the dual system is supported by the record. \n\"Thus the remedial techniques used in the District Court's order were within that court's power to \nprovide equitable relief; implementation of the decree is well within the capacity of the school \nauthority. \n\"The decree provided that the buses used to implement the plan would operate on direct routes. \nStudents would be picked up at schools near their homes and transported to the schools they were \nto attend. The trips for elementary school pupils average about seven miles and the District Court \nfound that they would take `not over 35 minutes at the most.' This system compares favorably with \nthe transportation plan previously operated in Charlotte under which each day 23,600 students on all \n\ngrade levels were transported an average of 15 miles one way for an average trip requiring over an \nhour. In these circumstances, we find no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not \nbe required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation. Desegregation plans \ncannot be limited to the walk-in school. \n\"An objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of travel is so \ngreat as to either risk the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational \nprocess. District courts must weigh the soundness of any transportation plan in light of what is said \nin subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) above. It hardly needs stating that the limits on time of travel will vary \nwith many factors, but probably with none more than the age of the students. The reconciliation of \ncompeting values in a desegregation case is, of course, a difficult task with many sensitive facets but \nfundamentally no more so than remedial measures courts of equity have traditionally \nemployed.\" Swann v. Board of Education, 258*258 supra, at 29-31, 91 S.Ct. at 1282-1283. \n(Emphasis added.) \nIn North Carolina v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 46, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 1286, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971), the Chief \nJustice said: \"As noted in Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 29, 91 S.Ct. at 1282, bus transportation has \nlong been an integral part of all public educational systems, and it is unlikely that a truly effective \nremedy could be devised without continued reliance on it.\" \nd) Equity Power to Require Payment of Tax Funds for Integrated Schools: \nIn the exercise of its equity powers, a District Court may order that public funds be expended, \nparticularly when such an expenditure is necessary to meet the minimum requirements mandated by \nthe Constitution. Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 233, 84 \nS.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964); Eaton v. New Hanover County Board of Education, 459 F.2d 684 \n(4th Cir. 1972); Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, 456 F. 2d 943, 947, 948 (4th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 406 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 1778, 32 L.Ed.2d 136 (1972); Plaquemines Parish School Board v. \nUnited States, 415 F.2d 817 (5th Cir. 1969). \nThis opinion heretofore has emphasized that the Legislature of Michigan has an opportunity to \ndetermine the organizational and governmental structure of an enlarged desegregation area to \nremedy the unconstitutional segregation results set forth in this opinion. In the event the Legislature \nfails to act effectively and expeditiously, the foregoing and other cases cited in this opinion outline \nthe broad scope of equitable relief that may be fashioned by the District Court in this case on \nremand after all school districts to be affected are afforded an opportunity to be heard as \nhereinabove provided. \nIX. Other Issues \nNumerous other issues are presented which do not require discussion. \nWe do not consider it necessary to construe the \"Broomfield Amendment,\" Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 \nStat. 235, § 803, known as the Education Amendments of 1972, since no final desegregation order \nhas been entered. Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 419 F.2d 1387, 1392 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. \ndenied, 402 U.S. 962, 91 S.Ct. 1630, 29 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971) is not controlling. There the District \nCourt made findings of fact that there had been no unconstitutional conduct on the part of the \nCincinnati Board of Education. This court held that these findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. \nRule 52(a), Fed.R. Civ.P. \nAll other contentions presented by the parties contrary to the conclusions reached in this opinion \nhave been considered and are found to be without merit. \n\nX. Conclusion \n1. The Ruling of the District Court on the Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, and \nreported at 338 F. Supp. 582, is affirmed. \n2. The findings of fact and conclusions of law on \"Detroit-only\" plans of desegregation, dated March \n28, 1972, are affirmed. \n3. The Ruling on Propriety of a Metropolitan Remedy to Accomplish Desegregation of the Public \nSchools of the City of Detroit, dated March 24, 1972, is affirmed in part, but vacated for the reasons \nset forth above. \n4. The Ruling on Desegregation Area and Development of Plan, dated June 14, 1972, and reported \nat 345 F. Supp. 914, is vacated except as hereinabove prescribed. \n5. The order dated July 11, 1972, directing the purchase of school buses is vacated. \nThe case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \nNo costs are taxed. Each party will bear his own costs. \n259*259 EDWARDS, CELEBREZZE, PECK, McCREE, and LIVELY, Circuit Judges, concur. \nWEICK, Circuit Judge (dissenting): \nEighty-seven years before the landmark decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) was announced, the legislature of the \nState of Michigan, in Public Acts of Michigan, 1867, Act 34 § 28, had abolished segregation in the \npublic school system which had prohibited Negro children from attending the same public schools as \nwhite children. This statute in relevant parts reads as follows: \n\"All residents of any district shall have an equal right to attend any school therein. . . .\" \nThe Supreme Court of Michigan, in an opinion written for the court by Chief Justice Cooley, \nconstrued the statute in 1869 and held it applicable to Detroit and that Detroit constituted one school \ndistrict. In granting a writ of mandamus requiring the school board to admit a Negro child who had \nbeen denied admission, Chief Justice Cooley said: \n\"It cannot be seriously urged that with this provision in force, the school board of any district which is \nsubject to it may make regulations which would exclude any resident of the district from any of its \nschools, because of race or color, or religious belief, or personal peculiarities. It is too plain for \nargument that an equal right to all of the schools, irrespective of such distinctions, was meant to be \nestablished.\" People, ex rel. Workman v. Board of Education of Detroit, 18 Mich. 400, 409 (1869). \nThe issues in this case do not concern the right of any Negro child in Detroit to attend any school he \ndesires in that City. They do involve the authority of a district judge to adopt a so-called metropolitan \nplan designed to integrate the Negro school children living in Detroit with white children living in \nthree adjoining counties and attending public schools in fifty-two additional school districts, eighteen \nof which districts have never been made parties to this lawsuit. Conditions were imposed on the \ndistricts allowed to intervene which rendered their intervention ineffective. \n\nThe District Judge followed the pattern of Judge Merhige in the Richmond case whose decision was \nreversed by the Fourth Circuit in Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 462 F.2d 1058 \n(4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by equally divided court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (Nos. 72-\n549, 72-550, 1973). 41 U.S.L.W. 4685. The fact that Richmond involved dismantling of a dual \nsystem was regarded as unimportant by the District Judge. \nIn an unprecedented opinion, a panel of this Court and now a majority of the en banc Court have \nupheld findings of the District Court that segregation exists in Detroit and that it cannot be \ndismantled with a Detroit-only plan of desegregation and the District Court may consider and adopt a \nmetropolitan plan.[1] \nJust to start such a plan involves the expenditure of about $3,000,000 for the purchase of 295 buses \nand untold millions of dollars to operate them and for other expenses. It will involve about 780,000 \nchildren and, if ordered by the court, will force the busing of black children, against their will and \nwithout the consent of their parents, from the inner city of Detroit to one or more of the fifty-three \ndifferent school districts in four counties, and the white children of these districts will be forcibly \nbused to 260*260 the inner city. None of these children have committed any offense for which they \nshould be so punished. It will disrupt the lives of these children and their parents. The metropolitan \nplan was ill conceived and is a legal monstrosity. However, such a plan will achieve a racial balance \nor quota in the desegregation area, which is what plaintiffs are seeking. \nThe District Court made no findings that any of the fifty-two school districts outside of Detroit had \npracticed desegregation tactics against Negro children in their districts or in any other district, or that \nthey were in any wise responsible for the concentration of Negroes or their segregation in Detroit. \nThese fifty-two school districts have been created by the legislature as separate and independent \ncorporate units with power to sue and be sued. They are governed by locally-elected Boards of \nEducation. In each district, the real estate of the people living therein is taxed for the support of their \npublic schools. \nThe school districts were established by neutral legislation when the cities were incorporated. There \nwas not an iota of evidence in the record that the boundaries of the Detroit school district, or any \nother school district in Michigan, were established for the purpose of creating, maintaining or \nperpetuating segregation of the races. No such claim was ever made by the plaintiffs. \nIn 1910, long after the districts were created, the black population of Detroit was only 1.2% of the \ntotal population of the City. By 1970 it had increased to 43.9% of the total population of 1,511,000. It \nis obvious that the great influx of blacks, as well as whites, to Detroit was influenced by the favorable \nindustrial climate existing in Michigan and the ability of its industry, principally automotive, to provide \njobs. \nIn the school year 1970-1971, there was 285,512 students in the public school system in Detroit of \nwhich 168,200 or 63.8% were black and 117,312 or 37.2% were white. The School Board of Detroit \nought not to be blamed for the heavy concentration of blacks in the inner City, for housing \nconditions, or for discrimination by public or private agencies or individuals and ought not to be \nsaddled with the duty to dismantle the concentration. These same conditions exist in other cities \nthroughout the country regardless of the type of school system in effect — whether de jure or de \nfacto. Nor should the adjoining three counties and the fifty-two school districts be penalized because \nthey are located near Detroit. \nIn his book Negroes in Cities, Dr. Karl Taeuber states that residential segregation exists \"regardless \nof the character of local laws and policies and regardless of other forms of discrimination\". He said \n\nsubstantially the same thing in his article \"Residential Segregation\" in the August, 1965 issue \nof Scientific American. \nIn Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by equally \ndivided Court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (Nos. 72-549, 72-550, (1973), 41 U. \nS.L.W. 4685, the Court said: \n\"The root causes of the concentration of blacks in the inner city are simply not known. . . .\" \nAnd: \n\"Whatever the basic causes, it has not been school assignments and school assignments cannot \nreverse that trend.\" \nThe District Court was motivated in its decision by social considerations. In a pretrial conference on \nOctober 4, 1971 the District Court stated: \n\"We need not recite the many serious problems such a plan entails, suffice it to say that a plan of \nsuch dimensions can hardly be conceived in a day, to say nothing of the time it will require for \nimplementation. A large metropolitan area such as we have in our case can not be made the subject \nof instant integration. We must bear in mind that the task we are called upon to perform is a social \none, which 261*261 society has been unable to accomplish. In reality, our courts are called upon, in \nthese school cases, to attain a social goal, through the educational system, by using law as a lever.\" \nApp. IV, pp. 454, 455. \nThis is incredible! \nIt is submitted that the courts are not called upon to integrate the school system, using law as a \nlever. Nor should judges assume to act as legislators, for which they are neither fitted nor qualified. It \nis enough for judges to perform their judicial function and to abide by the separation of powers \ndoctrine provided by our Constitution. \nThe thesis of the panel which wrote the original opinion in this appeal is best stated in its own words \nin its slip opinion: \n\"This court in considering this record finds it impossible to declare `clearly erroneous' the District \nJudge's conclusion that any Detroit only desegregation plan will lead directly to a single segregated \nDetroit school district overwhelmingly black in all of its schools, surrounded by a ring of suburbs and \nsuburban school districts overwhelmingly white in composition in a State in which the racial \ncomposition is 87 per cent white and 13 per cent black. Big city school systems for blacks \nsurrounded by suburban school systems for whites cannot represent equal protection of the law.\" \nSlip Opin. p. 65. \nThe majority opinion adopts all of the paragraph except the last sentence which reads as follows: \n\"Big city school systems for blacks surrounded by suburban school systems for whites cannot \nrepresent equal protection under the law.\" \nIn my opinion, the retained part of the paragraph expresses the same thought as the sentence which \nhas been deleted. \n\nNo decision of the Supreme Court or any other court construing the Constitution supports this thesis \nand it is not our province to rewrite the Constitution. \nThe majority opinion sharply conflicts with Spencer v. Kugler, 326 F.Supp. 1235 \n(D.N.J.1971), affirmed, 404 U.S. 1027, 92 S.Ct. 707, 30 L.Ed.2d 723 (1972). In Spencerthe black \nstudents sued the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey, the Commissioner of Education and \nthe State Board of Education alleging that they failed to achieve a racial balance among several \ndistricts of a state system of public schools. New Jersey, like Michigan, did not operate a dual \nsystem and the alleged imbalance was characterized as de facto segregation. \nThe three-judge Court which heard the case stated: \n\"In none of the schools of which the plaintiffs complain is any black pupil `segregated' from any white \npupil. Indeed, complaint is made that the blacks who reside in the school district served predominate \nover the whites, thus affording an example of complete desegregation which was the expressed \nobject of the court in the Brown case. 347 U.S. at page 487 of the Opinion at page 688 of 74 S.Ct. \nin Brown it is stated that: \n`In each of the cases [from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware] minors of the Negro \nrace, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the \npublic schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, they had been denied \nadmission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation \naccording to race.' \nSuch is not the basis upon which each of the plaintiffs in the present case seeks relief in this cause. \nOn the contrary plaintiffs would have a substantial portion of the pupils now in attendance in their \nrespective schools ordered by the court removed from these schools and assigned to a school in \nanother district. Alternatively plaintiffs would have the court abolish the respective districts in which \ntheir 262*262 schools are located and assign them to other districts in which the disproportion \nbetween white and black students is reduced in one direction or the other. If, as plaintiffs contend, \nthe proportionate black attendance in their respective schools adversely affects the degree of \nexcellence of education which they can receive there must be a point at which any excess of blacks \nover whites is likely to impair the quality of the education available in that school for the black pupils. \nNowhere in the Appendix filed by the plaintiffs or in the facts involved in any of the judicial \nprecedents which they cite are we informed of the specific racial proportions which are likely to \nassure maximum excellence of the educational advantages available for the whites. Assuming \nfurther that efforts to achieve the ideal interracial proportion necessarily include the alteration of the \npopulation factor determinative of the redistricting, there can be no assurance that the population \nfactor will remain static. If so, it would be necessary to successively reassign pupils to another \ndistrict as the rate of births and graduations alters the racial proportions creating the demand for the \neducational facilities as it changes from term to term. In sum, the difficulty complained of does not \namount to unconstitutional segregation.\" (Id. at 1239-1240). \nSpeaking of school district boundaries, the Court stated: \n\"It is clear that these legislative enactments prescribe school district boundaries in conformity with \nmunicipal boundaries. This designation of school district zones is therefore based on the geographic \nlimitations of the various municipalities throughout the State. Nowhere in the drawing of school \ndistrict lines are considerations of race, creed, color or national origin made. The setting of \nmunicipalities as local school districts is a reasonable standard especially in light of the municipal \ntaxing authority. The system as provided by the various legislative enactments is unitary in nature \nand intent and any purported racial imbalance within a local school district results from an imbalance \nin the population of that municipality-school district. Racially balanced municipalities are beyond the \npale of either judicial or legislative intervention.\" (Id. at 1240). \n\nSpencer is on \"all fours\" with our case. \nThe majority opinion conflicts with prior decisions of this Court with the unfortunate result that acts \nwhich do not violate the Constitution in Cincinnati, are held to be unconstitutional in Detroit. \nThe two decisions with which the majority opinion is in irreconcilable conflict are Deal v. Cincinnati \nBoard of Education, 419 F.2d 1387 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 962, 91 S.Ct. 1630, 29 \nL.Ed.2d 128 (1971); Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. 1966), cert. \ndenied, 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114 (1967),affirming, 244 F.Supp. 572. Twice the \nSupreme Court was afforded the opportunity to review Deal and as late as 1971 it refused to do so, \nwith only one Justice dissenting. \nMore than eighty-two years ago Ohio, like Michigan, by statute had abolished segregation in the \npublic schools in the State. The neighborhood school system, however, was provided by statute so \nthat schools would be constructed at such places as will be convenient for the attendance of the \nlargest number of children. Ohio Rev.Code § 3313.48. It was not then believed that neighborhood \nschools were obnoxious. Nevertheless, in Cincinnati the races were imbalanced in the public school \nsystem. \nSome schools were attended entirely by Negroes and others entirely by whites, while others were \nattended in varying proportions by both white and Negroes. Some Negro schools were racially \nidentified. The segregation was allegedly caused by gerrymandered school-zone lines, by housing \ndiscrimination 263*263 by public and private agencies, by discrimination in job opportunities, and \nschool construction. \nWe held in Deal I that the Board of Education had no constitutional duty to eliminate racial imbalance \nnot caused or created by it, and upheld the neighborhood plan adopted by the State Legislature. \nThe District Judge had excluded evidence of discrimination in the public and private housing \nmarkets. We held this ruling was correct on the ground that the discrimination, if it existed, was \ncaused by persons not parties to that case and the Board of Education had no power to rectify that \nsituation. We said: \"[If] appellants have any valid claim for [infringing] their rights by public-housing or \nurban-renewal officials, they may obtain appropriate relief against them under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. With respect to private actions amounting to discriminatory practices, while there is no \nfederal constitutional right available to appellants, they may seek relief from the state Civil Rights \nCommission, or in the state courts, if relief is denied under the provisions of the Ohio Fair Housing \nLaw.[2] Deal I, 369 F.2d at 60 fn. 4. \nThe majority opinion also conflicts with Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, supra, and Swann v. \nBoard of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed.2d 554 (1971). \nSwann stated that: \"[The] objective is to dismantle the dual school system.\" Id. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at \n1282. Here there has been no dual school system to dismantle. Although not racially balanced, \nDetroit for many years had achieved a unitary school system in which no student was precluded \nfrom attending any school in the district. Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. \n19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969). There are limits as to how far a district court can \ngo. Swann, 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267. \nSwann also stated: \n\n\"If we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a matter of substantive \nconstitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be \ndisapproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" 402 U.S. at p. 24, 91 S.Ct. at p. 1280. \nThe metropolitan plan violates this principle which was applicable only to dual systems. It is even \nworse when the District Court applies broader orders to a unitary system than have ever been \napplied to dismantling of a dual system. \nSwann, is violated by overloading the school system with excess \"baggage.\" Id. at 22, 91 S.Ct. at \n1279. \nTHE DETROIT ONLY PLAN \nThe finding of the District Court that a Detroit only plan could not accomplish desegregation is not \nsupported by the evidence and are clearly erroneous. The percentage of black and white children in \nthe public schools in 1970-1971 was 63.8% and 37.2% respectively. The racial composition of the \nstate is 87% white and 13% black. \nIn Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L. Ed.2d 51 (1972), the \nSupreme Court approved a pairing plan for the City and County which had a racial composition of \n34% white and 66% black. The existing ratios in Detroit are practically the same. \nBut the District Court in our case was concerned about its own forecast of population 264*264 trends \nthat the percentage of black students would increase from 63.8% in 1970 to 72% in 1980, and in \n1992 would be all black. This forecast is wholly speculative. \nSuch an unsupported and speculative forecast cannot be made the basis for a metropolitan cross-\ndistrict order. Even if true, which it is not, the Board of Education is not responsible for the population \nremaining static, or for the mobility of the races. This was made clear in Spencer, supra, id., 326 \nF.Supp. at 1239, 1240, and also in Swann, supra, id., 402 U.S. at 31, 32, 91 S.Ct. 1267. Nor is the \nBoard required from time to time to adopt plans to meet shifting population trends. Spencer, \nsupra; Swann, supra. \nSignificantly, all that the plaintiffs are complaining about is the operation of the Detroit school system \nand the failure of the State defendants to properly supervise, control or finance it. Plaintiffs cannot \ncomplain about school district lines because those lines were neutrally drawn with the incorporation \nof the cities long before the Negroes had migrated north in large numbers. If school-zone lines in \nDetroit have not been properly drawn or if there are imbalances of black and white students, or \nimbalances on faculty or staffs in the Detroit schools, or if school buildings have been improperly \nlocated, or if plaintiffs have been discriminated against in any other respect, these inequities can all \nbe remedied in the Detroit school system without forcibly moving Negroes and whites against their \nwill across district lines into other counties and districts. An order requiring the adoption of a \nmetropolitan plan under the facts of this case, merely to dismantle the concentration of blacks in the \ninner city, violates constitutional rights of both races and constitutes a flagrant abuse of judicial \npower.[3] Swann recognized a limitation on the power of District Judges. Id., 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. \n1267. Chief Justice Vinson, in writing the opinion for the court in Oyama v. California, 332 U.S. 633, \n646, 68 S.Ct. 269, 275, 92 L.Ed. 249 (1948), stated: \n\"But assuming, for [the] purposes of argument only, that the basic prohibition is constitutional, it does \nnot follow that there is no constitutional limit to the means which may be used to enforce it.\" \n\nThus, the District Court may not enter orders in school desegregation cases which impinge upon and \nviolate the constitution rights of other persons. \nMany Negroes as well as whites are opposed to integration of the races in the public school system \nby enforced busing.[4] A busing order directed at \"benefiting\" black students in Detroit (by distributing \nthe black student population throughout the entire metropolitan area) produces a head-on clash of \nconstitutional principles. Blacks are given an (alleged) benefit when other citizens \"similarly \nsituated\", i. e., other minority-group students and even inner-city white students, are not given such \nbenefits but are discriminated against. This result, of course, is a classic denial of the equal \nprotection of the laws. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27, 32, 5 S.Ct. 357, 28 L.Ed. 923 (1885); Truax \nv. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312, 333, 42 S.Ct. 124, 66 L.Ed. 254 (1921). \nIn a very recent thought-provoking article, appended hereto as Appendix A and entitled \"Reverse \nDiscrimination\", Dr. Morton Teicher, Dean of the School of Social Science of the University of North \nCarolina, discussed the problems of deprived groups and remedies for past discrimination including \nquota systems. 265*265 Since opinions of sociologists were relied upon in Brown I, it is important \nthat they not be overlooked here. See also the discussion entitled \"Busing: A Review of `The \nEvidence'\", The Public Interest No. 30 Winter 1973; \"The Evidence on Busing,\" The Public \nInterest No. 28 Summer 1972; Ross, \"Why Quotas Won't Work,\" Reader's Digest, Feb. 1973, p. 51. \nThe District Court's metropolitan cross-district order, an order purportedly directed at furthering the \npurposes of the equal protection clause, itself clashes with this constitutional principle. \nThe metropolitan busing remedy ordered by the Court is, however, unconstitutional on a more \nfundamental level. It invalidly assumes that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects groups and not individuals. The entire thrust of the District Court's order is that \nthe rights of blacks as a group must be redressed and that, in the process, the rights of individual \nblack children (and non-black children) may be disregarded. \nConsider the burden on the individual students who are bused in order to achieve a \"racial balance\" \nthroughout the entire Detroit Metropolitan Area. Individual black and white students who formerly \nwalked to a nearby school would be forced to travel substantial distances to other schools. These \nare not individuals who are burdened because their parents have chosen to reside far from the \nnearest school in the district or because they have special educational needs attended to in but a \nsingle school in the district. These are individual children who are burdened with being bused solely \nbecause they are black or white, as the case may be. \nParenthetically, it should be noted that if there were any question that busing involves a substantial \nburden on the individual who cannot attend his neighborhood school, that question has been \ndispelled by the urgings of desegregation-case plaintiffs that black children can not be \"unequally \nburdened\" by being the only students bused, the white students being permitted to attend their \nneighborhood schools. See e. g., Haney v. County Bd. of Education of Sevier Co., 429 F.2d 364, \n371-372 (8th Cir. 1970); Brice v. Landis, 314 F.Supp. 974, 978-979 (N.D.Calif.1969). \nYet in proposing a remedy for black students as a group based on a head count, the District Court \nentirely disregards these individual black and white students and their right not to be burdened solely \non account of their race. \nThe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states: \n\". . . nor shall any state . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" \n(Emphasis added.) \n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized the individual nature of the equal protection clause on a number \nof occasions.[5] In Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22, 68 266*266 S.Ct. 836, 846, 92 L.Ed. 1161 \n(1948), the Court was explicit: \n\"The rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment [the equal protection clause] \nare, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights. [Court's n. \n29.] McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., 235 U.S. 151, 161-162, 35 S.Ct. 69, 59 L.Ed. \n169 (1914); Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337, 59 S. Ct. 232, 83 L.Ed. 208 \n(1938); Oyama v. California, 332 U.S. 633, 68 S.Ct. 269, 92 L.Ed. 249 (1948).\" \nIt simply defies logic to have a \"constitutionally required\" remedy for a group of individuals which, in \nturn, unconstitutionally denies equal protection to the individuals in the group as well as individuals in \nother groups, and which remedy unconstitutionally imposes burdens on students within and without \nthe group solely because of their race. Yet this is precisely what the District Court has held. The \nCourt states (correctly) that discrimination against the black race in Detroit must be remedied, but \nthen orders massive interdistrict busing of students to achieve racial balances, denying individual \nblacks (and nonblacks) their right not to be substantially burdened solely on account of their race. \nBut the fundamental error of the District Court order was in treating the Michigan school system as a \ndual system when it was not, and in proposing the dismantling of concentration of blacks in Detroit \nand distributing them in fifty-two other school districts in three other counties. Virtually all of the \ncases relied upon by the plaintiffs to support the District Court's rulings involved dual school \nsystems. \nDUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS OF FIFTH AND \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION \nAlthough, as stated by the majority, this is the fourth time that the case has been before us, the \nDistrict Court has not as yet adopted any specific plan for desegregation; instead the District Court \nhas entered a number of interlocutory orders some of which are now before us for review under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(b). These include rulings on the issue of Segregation, findings of fact and conclusions \nof law on Detroit Only Plan of Desegregation, propriety of a Metropolitan remedy to desegregate \nDetroit Schools, Desegregation Area, and Order directing Michigan State officials to purchase 295 \nschool buses. \nThis procedure is unprecedented. Usually school desegregation cases are reviewed on appeal only \nafter a plan of desegregation has been adopted. It appears to us that the District Court has placed \nthe cart before the horse. It has entered a number of far-reaching piecemeal interlocutory orders \nfrom which no appeal could be taken without the court's permission, and which would bring about a \nfait accompli of a metropolitan plan without affording the defendants their right of appeal. This was in \nthe absence of necessary and indispensable parties and to the prejudice of intervening school \ndistricts which had been denied effective participation in the proceedings. \nThe Complaint, which has never been amended, sought only the desegregation of the Detroit school \nsystem. There was no allegation that any other school district would be affected. As soon as it was \ndetermined that other school districts might be adversely affected, the District Court should have \nrequired the plaintiffs to make them parties defendant with a full opportunity to be heard on the \nmerits of the case. These school districts were necessary and indispensable parties. This is the \ncorrect procedure, and was followed in Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 338 \nF.Supp. 67 (E.D.Va.1971), reversed on other grounds, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by \n\nequally divided Court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L. Ed.2d 771 (Nos. 72-549, 72-550, 1973), 41 \nU.S.L.W. 4685. \n267*267 All school districts whose borders were being invaded were entitled, as a matter of right and \nnot of mere grace, to be made parties defendant in the case and to be accorded the same rights as \nany other defendants. They were entitled to be heard on all issues in the case which affected them, \nand were entitled to participate effectively in the proceedings. They were entitled to be heard on the \nissues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\". They had the right to offer \nevidence and endeavor to prove that there was no causal connection between any act or omission \nof the Detroit Board of Education (or of the State) and the concentration of blacks in the inner City, \nand that whatever constitutional violations of the rights of the plaintiffs may have occurred, such \nviolations could be remedied within the Detroit school district without invading other districts which \nwere not in any manner responsible for conditions in Detroit. These rights were denied to the \nintervenors. \nWhile the orders of the District Court on these three issues were interlocutory, the judgment entered \nby the majority is final and the issues may not be relitigated on remand. Thus judgment has been \nentered against the absent school districts as well as those allowed to intervene, in violation of their \ndue process rights to a fair and impartial trial. The orders affirmed are far reaching; they will require \nthe expenditure of untold millions, and will disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and \ntheir parents. \nHowever, in its opinion the majority did provide for amendment of pleadings on remand, making new \nparty defendants, for intervention, and for offering additional testimony. These provisions are wholly \nillusory with respect to the issues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\", \nas the opinion expressly excludes these issues from reconsideration upon the remand. The only \nremedy available to the intervening school districts is to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari. \nThe eighteen school districts, as well as any additional school districts which the District Court may \nadd to the desegregation area upon the remand, are without any remedy. Since they have never \nbeen made parties, they may not petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. They have surely \nbeen deprived of their property rights, not only without due process of law, but without any process \nof law. \nThe majority opinion, with its disapproval of the \"Detroit-Only\" plan and its order to the District Court \nto consider and adopt a so-called \"Metropolitan\" plan invading the borders of three counties and the \nboundaries of fifty-two school districts, completely destroys local control of the public school system \nalong with all of its advantages. Local control is a traditional concept of the American public school \nsystem. Its merit and value were recognized by the Supreme Court in two very recent decisions. San \nAntonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16(decided \nMarch 21, 1973); and Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 \nL.Ed.2d 51 (1972). \nIn San Antonio Independent School District, supra, Mr. Justice Powell, wrote the opinion for the \nCourt, cited and quoted from opinions of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Potter Stewart \nin Wright, stating: \n\"The Texas system of school finance is responsive to these two forces. While assuring a basic \neducation for every child in the State, it permits and encourages a large measure of participation in \nand control of each district's schools at the local level. In an era that has witnessed a consistent \ntrend toward centralization of the functions of government, local sharing of responsibility for public \neducation has survived. The merit of local control was recognized last Term in both the majority and \ndissenting opinions in Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S. Ct. 2196, 33 \n\nL.Ed.2d 51 (1972). Mr. 268*268 Justice Stewart stated there that `[d]irect control over decisions \nvitally affecting the education of one's children is a need that is strongly felt in our society.' Id., at \n469, 92 S.Ct. 2196. The Chief Justice, in his dissent, agreed that `[l]ocal control is not only vital to \ncontinued public support of the schools, but it is of overriding importance from an educational \nstandpoint as well.' Id., at 478, 92 S. Ct. at 2211. \n\"The persistence of attachment to government at the lowest level where education is concerned \nreflects the depth of commitment of its supporters. In part, local control means, as Professor \nColeman suggests, the freedom to devote more money to the education of one's children. Equally \nimportant, however, is the opportunity it offers for participation in the decision-making process that \ndetermines how those local tax dollars will be spent. Each locality is free to tailor local programs to \nlocal needs. Pluralism also affords some opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a healthy \ncompetition for educational excellence. An analogy to the Nation-State relationship in our federal \nsystem seems uniquely appropriate. Mr. Justice Brandeis identified as one of the peculiar strengths \nof our form of government each State's freedom to `serve as a laboratory . . . and try novel social \nand economic experiments.' No area of social concern stands to profit more from a multiplicity of \nviewpoints and from a diversity of approaches than does public education.\" (411 U.S. at 49, 93 S.Ct. \nat 1305.) \nAs we have pointed out, the facts of the present case furnish no basis whatsoever for the Court to \ndestroy local control of our public school system. \nUnreasonable and intolerable conditions, however, were imposed by the Court on the intervention by \nthe school districts.[6] The school districts filed objections to the conditions which were never ruled on \nby the Court. These conditions alone constituted a denial of due process to the intervenors who \nwere precluded 269*269 from raising questions necessary for their own protection and who were \ndenied the right to be heard fully on the merits of the case. \nThe type of intervention permitted by the District Court is graphically illustrated in the brief filed by \ncounsel for the intervenors in which he complains about the following incidents with citation of \nsupporting record references: \n\"Seven days after allowing appellants to intervene, as a matter of right but subject to oppressive \nconditions, [27] the trial court required the filing of written briefs on the legal propriety of a \nmetropolitan plan of desegregation. (A. Ia397) The court did not require or permit oral argument. \nLess than 36 hours later the court issued its `Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan \nRemedy to Accomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools of the City of Detroit' (A. Ia439) \nrejecting the contentions of Intervenor School Districts. Testimony regarding metropolitan plans \ncommenced four days later (a weekend and Motion day falling between) at 10:10 A.M. Prior to the \nnoon recess, just two hours after Intervenor School District counsel had first appeared in the District \nCourt and before completion of testimony of a single witness, the District Judge announced that \ncounsel could stop by his office and pick up his `Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-\nonly Plans of Desegregation' (A. Ia456) wherein the court announced its intention to seek a more \ndesirable racial mix by means of a Metropolitan Plan. \nThus without any opportunity for oral argument, without opportunity to examine or cross-examine \none witness, without opportunity to present one shred of evidence, and indeed, without opportunity \nto obtain copies of previous pleadings and testimony (let alone read same), the Intervenor School \nDistricts had been effectively foreclosed from protecting their interests. [28].\" \nHe further complains about the fact that the Court permitted him to take the deposition of Dr. David \nArmor, a sociologist of Harvard University, and then refused to receive it in evidence. \n\nDr. Armor was a well-qualified expert. He had previously written an article entitled \"The Evidence on \nBusing\" published in The Public Interest No. 28, Summer 1972, which exploded some of the existing \ntheories on educational achievement resulting from busing. \nIn a subsequent article by Dr. Thomas F. Pettigrew and associates, they responded to Dr. Armor's \narticle on busing and quoted from Judge Roth's ruling excluding his deposition as follows: \n\"This fundamental fact was dramatically demonstrated by the judicial reaction to Armor's deposition \nin the Detroit school case, a deposition based on an earlier draft of `The Evidence on Busing.' On \nJune 12, 1972, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen H. Roth ruled the deposition inadmissible as \nevidence on the grounds of irrelevancy. The deposition, in Judge Roth's view, represented `a new \nrationale for a return to the discredited \"separate but equal policy . . . .'\"[7] The Public Interest No. 30, \nWinter 1973. \nIn an article entitled \"The Double Double Standard\" appearing in the same issue at page 119, Dr. \nArmor replied to the Pettigrew article stating among other things: \n\"The double standard here is obvious. One willingly applies social science findings to public policy if \nthey are in accordance with one's values, but declares them irrelevant if they contradict one's values. \n. . .\" Id. at 130. \n270*270 The Supreme Court in Brown I relied heavily on testimony of sociologists as to the adverse \neffect of segregation on the educational achievement of Negro children. It is inconceivable that the \nDistrict Court would hold contrary testimony of a sociologist irrelevant and exclude it. This was \nprejudicial error. In a court of justice not merely one side but both sides are entitled to offer evidence. \nThe District Court quashed a subpoena duces tecum issued by the intervenors for Charles Wells, an \nemployee of the Detroit Board of Education, to bring with him \"all records of the past two (2) years \nconcerning incidents involving damage to property, safety of pupils or staff (whether perpetrated by \nother pupils, staff or outsiders) criminal activities, or fires in or on school property as regards each \nschool in the Detroit public school system.\" \nAlthough the Court had previously received the testimony of Freeman Flynn, offered by plaintiffs on \nthe subject of safety, it denied permission to the Intervenors to offer evidence on the same subject \nby quashing the subpoena. The Court was not that technical in admitting into evidence Exhibit 16, \nalthough it was not properly identified, stating that the Court decided to follow Justice of the Peace \nCane's rule: \"We will let it in for what it is worth.\" Indeed, he did, but did not apply Justice Cane's rule \nto the deposition. \nDue process required an opportunity to be heard which must be granted at a meaningful time and in \na meaningful manner.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 302 U.S. 388, 393, \n58 S.Ct. 334, 338, 82 L.Ed. 319 (1938): \n\"The right to a fair and open hearing is one of the rudiments of fair play assured to every litigant by \nthe Federal Constitution as a minimal requirement. Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities \nComm'n, 301 U.S. 292, 304, 305.\" \n\nThe intervenors were entitled to the effective assistance of counsel, to have a reasonable time to \nexamine the papers in the case and to prepare for trial, and to offer evidence in support of their \ncontentions before the case is decided against them. \nOne other matter is worthy of comment. The District Court appointed a nine-member panel to set up \na metropolitan plan of desegregation. Three members of the panel were from Detroit. Only one \nmember was appointed to represent the fifty-two school districts whose school population exceeds \nthat of Detroit by more than two times. This is a plain example of unfairness. \nThe Detroit Board of Education, although vigorously denying the commission of any purposeful \nsegregative acts committed against Negroes and contending that plaintiffs have not proven their \ncase, has taken an unusual and extraordinary position. It supports the plaintiffs on the issue of a \nmetropolitan plan contending that if a constitutional violation has been shown, only such a drastic \nremedy will rectify it. It is obvious that the Detroit Board was motivated by its concern that a 63.8%-\nblack and a 37.2%-white quota was too heavily weighted with black pupils, and that it owed a \nconstitutional duty to dilute that quota and to distribute the black-pupil population of Detroit into the \nother three counties and fifty-two additional school districts, in order to effectuate a quota of about \n25%-black and 75%-white children in each school. \nIt is submitted that no such constitutional duty exists and that the District Court erred in ordering \nit; Swann, supra. \n271*271 THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT TO THE \nCONSTITUTION PROSCRIBES SUITS AGAINST THE \nSTATE OF MICHIGAN, AND IT HAS SOVEREIGN \nIMMUNITY \nThe plaintiffs have attempted to sue the State of Michigan by making the Governor, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the Acting Superintendent of Schools parties defendant. Later, when the District Court \nissued an order prior to the adoption of any plan for desegregation, to purchase 295 buses, it made \nthe Treasurer of the State a party defendant in order to sequester funds in his hands. \nIt was the theory of the plaintiffs that under the doctrine of vicarious liability the state was liable for \nthe acts and conduct of the Detroit Board of Education and of other political subdivisions, and that \nsince the State is a party defendant it really was not necessary to make the Detroit School Board, or \nthe school boards in the other districts, parties to the case. This theory has no legal support and is \nunsound. Each school district is a separate and independent corporate unit with power to sue and to \nbe sued, and has separate taxpayers whose property is taxed for the support of the schools as well \nas for the payment of the district's bond issues. \nIf, as plaintiffs contend, the State has been made a party defendant, then such an action against the \nState is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment. \nThe most recent decision of the Supreme Court upholding sovereign immunity of a state is Krause v. \nState of Ohio, 409 U.S. 1052, 93 S.Ct. 557, 34 L. Ed.2d 506 (1972). \nTo the same effect is Ex Parte State of New York, 256 U.S. 490, 41 S.Ct. 588, 65 L.Ed. 1057 \n(1921), where the court made it clear that the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment \"is to be \n\ndetermined not by the mere names of the titular parties but by the essential nature and effect of the \nproceeding as it appears from the entire record.\" Id. at 500, 41 S.Ct. at 590. \nThe general rule was stated in Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963), as \nfollows: \n\"The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if `the judgment sought would expend itself \non the public treasury or domain or interfere with the public administration,' Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. \n731, 738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947), or if the effect of the judgment would be `to \nrestrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.' Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., \nsupra, 337 U.S. 682 at 704, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L. Ed. 1628; Ex parte New York, 256 U.S. 490, 502, \n41 S.Ct. 588, 65 L.Ed. 1057 (1921).\" \nThe Civil Rights Act has not yet been construed as an exception to the Eleventh Amendment. \nThe order issued against the State defendants provided: \n\"1. The Defendant Detroit Board of Education shall acquire by purchase, lease or other contractual \narrangement at least 295 buses for use in the interim desegregation plan during the 1972-73 school \nyear. All financial obligations incurred as the result of this Order shall be the sole financial obligation \nof the State Defendants, including the added State Defendant State Treasurer Allison Green, as set \nforth below in Paragraph 2. Said order, lease, or other contract shall be entered into by negotiation \nand without the necessity for bids forthwith and in no event later than Thursday, July 13, 1972. \n2. The State Defendants shall bear the cost of this acquisition and State Defendants, including the \nadded State Defendant Green, shall take all necessary steps utilizing existing funds and sources of \nrevenue, to be acquired State funds, legislatively authorized and funds directed by the State \nConstitution to the State School Aid Funds and by re-allocation of existing or new funds to pay for \nsaid transportation acquisition either directly or 272*272 through the Defendant Detroit Board.\" App. \nat 576, 577. \nThis order imposed a personal liability on the State defendants and would require them, if they \ncomplied with it, to misappropriate and misapply State funds in violation of state law. If they did not \ncomply with it they could be punished for contempt. \nIn addition, the State defendants were ordered to pay the cost of the nine-member panel appointed \nby the Court to devise the Metropolitan Plan, (1 Ba 538). This cost was estimated at $22,500. All \ndefendants were ordered to hire black counsellors and provide in-service training for teachers in the \nfifty-three school district desegregation area. The initial cost of the in-training was about $3,000,000. \nThe District Court was without authority to impose a personal liability on the State defendants or to \norder them to misapply and misappropriate State funds in violation of State law.[8] \nThe legislature of Michigan is not likely to act on the suggestion of the majority, accompanied by a \nveiled threat if it fails to so act, that it change school district boundary lines to benefit a few at the \nexpense of many, and thereby violate the constitutional rights of many. School district lines may not \nbe changed for an unconstitutional purpose. United States v. Scotland Neck City Board of \nEducation, 407 U.S. 484, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright v. Council of the City of \nEmporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972). Since an adequate remedy already \nexists within the Detroit school district to correct any constitutional violation therein, there is no \noccasion for the legislature to alter the existing neutral, non-discriminatory school district boundaries. \n\nRELIEF \nBecause of prejudicial errors of constitutional magnitude committed by the District Court, each of the \norders from which an appeal has been taken should be reversed and a new trial granted with \ninstructions to consider and adopt a Detroit-only desegregation plan to remedy any constitutional \nviolations which it may find to exist in said City. \nThe Governor, the Attorney General and the Treasurer of the State should be dismissed, as they are \nunnecessary parties to a determination of the issues of the case. \nAPPENDIX A \nREVERSE DISCRIMINATION \nThe development of \"affirmative action\" programs for minority groups is posing some intractable \nproblems. These problems arise from the existence of conflicting, fundamentally incompatible \nvalues. On the one hand, we social workers value righting the wrongs perpetrated for too long on \nminority groups. On the other hand, we value the right of all persons to be treated equally. \nDistributive justice requires the dissemination of benefits to all without depriving any individual or \ngroup of something it values. This is far more in keeping with fairness and equity than the idea of \nredistributive justice, which confers benefits on one group at the expense of others. Redistributive \njustice, then, leads to reverse discrimination. \nRedistributive justice is advocated to atone for our failure to live up to the belief in the capacity and \nthe dignity of each human being. This failure does not negate the soundness of that belief. Rather, it \nshould spur us to correct the failure — not the belief. When practices fail to reflect principles, then \nwe should change our practices, not our principles. \n273*273 For social workers, the issue has come to the forefront in agency and university hiring \npractices and admissions policies of schools of social work. Social agencies, especially those \nserving ghetto populations, are giving preference to minority group members in employment. \nUniversities, beset by pressures from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are \nsimilarly giving preference to women and minority groups. Some schools of social work have \nadopted quota systems in dealing with candidates for admission. \nThese practices conflict with the fundamental social work belief in individual human dignity and the \nlibertarian belief that each person is entitled to be judged and valued as an individual. Quota \nsystems and preferential treatment are artificial restrictions on this right because they substitute \nirrelevant group characteristics such as race or religion for consideration of an individual's capacity \nand potential. Respect for the individual is a basic part of social work's credo and commitment. We \ncannot reconcile this conviction with treating people only as representatives of a racial group. \nWhen we try to eliminate discrimination and compensate for past wrongs by quota systems, we \nsubstitute one injustice for another. We deny the inherent equality of all people and undermine the \nproposition that each individual should have the same opportunity to achieve and to be judged \naccording to his merits. We pit group against group and destroy the possibility of harmonious \ninteraction. Quotas are pernicious instruments; they represent an unacceptable means for achieving \na desirable end. \"Preferential quotas are condescending, divisive and detrimental to the integrity of a \nuniversity.\"[1] \n\nA quota system institutionalizes discrimination and must be vigorously opposed. Ultimately, it is a \nform of segregation. The progressive democratization of the university through the elimination of any \ncriterion for admission other than merit has been one of the success stories of America. Now some \nof the benighted beneficiaries of that victory ally themselves with those antilibertarian forces that \nwould have blocked their own access to education. They are ready to eradicate the victory of equal \nopportunity over discriminatory quotas, for which their forebears fought so hard. That victory has \nonly been partially won. We cannot falter now by substituting a host of irrelevant and inappropriate \nconsiderations for merit. The test a university must apply to each candidate is merit — not inherited \nstatus. \nSome advocates of quota systems believe that quotas will redress wrongs and thus produce equal \nopportunity, when actually they eliminate equal opportunity. Quotas have historically been used for \nexclusion. They were an insidious manifestation of institutionalized bigotry, covertly designed to \nexclude unwanted groups. They were wrong in the past and they are wrong now, even though they \nare now designed to achieve inclusion, rather than exclusion. Discriminatory practices are wrong, no \nmatter what their intent. Whether they are for or against particular groups, quota systems are morally \nindefensible. \nFor social workers, the distinctions among people based on race, ethnic background, religion, or \ncreed that inhere in quota systems are particularly abhorrent. Our regard for the individual and our \nobjection to hereditary caste as a status determinant should make quota systems especially \nimpossible for us to accept. \nFor schools of social work, the argument that quotas for admission will produce student bodies that \nrepresent the proportion of racial, ethnic, or religious groups in society is a curious expression of \nbigotry. Proportional representation on a group basis is highly discriminatory. What taxonomy shall \nbe used to categorize the groups that should be represented? Among the characteristics that defy \nclassification are the following: 274*274cultural, economic, ethnic, gender, geographic, linguistic, \nnational, occupational, racial, religious, social class, and tribal. \nSome minority groups include the following: the aged, American Indians, Asian-Americans, Blacks, \ncapitalists, Catholics, Chicanos, easterners, factory workers, farmers, German-Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, Hungarian-Americans, immigrants, Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Jews, the lower \nclass, migrants, nomads, northerners, Polish-Americans, the poor, Puerto Ricans, slum-dwellers, \nsoutherners, Swedish-Americans, the upper class, wasps, westerners, and youths. \nWho is not a member of a minority group? Who cannot find a place among this woefully incomplete \nlist of minorities? \nWe are all minorities. Each of us comes from a distinctive racial, religious, or ethnic stock. Each of \nus is a newcomer or a descendant of newcomers. Even the native Americans — the Indians — \ncame to North America from across the Bering Straits 25,000 years ago. Each of us has ties to our \nown roots. Each of us has pride in our origins. Each minority contributes to America — to its building, \nits evolution, and its maintenance. \n(Morton Teicher) \nMorton Teicher, Ph.D., is Dean, School of Social Work, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, \nNorth Carolina. \nKENT, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part): \n\nWhile I cannot concur in the majority opinion in these cases I am in accord with certain of the \nconclusions announced in that opinion. \nTo narrow the scope of this dissent it should be stated at the outset that I am in complete agreement \nwith the majority's conclusion that on the record as presented and because of the concessions made \nby counsel for the School District of the City of Detroit during oral argument it appears without \nquestion that the Detroit city schools were unconstitutionally segregated and that an order for \nintegration of those schools must be fashioned by the District Court. I am further in accord with the \nconclusion of the majority that the District Court's order for the purchase of buses for use in \neffectuating a plan of integration covering the metropolitan Detroit area is premature and must be \nstayed until an appropriate plan has been approved by the District Court. I agree that each of the \nsuburban school districts which may be affected by any proposed metropolitan plan is a necessary \nparty to the litigation within the meaning of Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as found by \nthe majority and that the pleadings must be amended to join such school districts and bring all \nparties before the Court. \nIt is at this point that I separate from the majority and find myself compelled to state the reasons why \nI cannot join in the majority opinion. The majority opinion approves the District Court's conclusion \nthat a Detroit only integration plan would be insufficient to cure the unconstitutional segregation \nfound to have been imposed in the Detroit city schools. Those who join in such a conclusion appear \nto me to have a misapprehension of the record in this case. \nAs stated by the Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, at page \n22, 91 S.Ct. 1267, at page 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971): \n\"The constant theme and thrust of every holding from Brown I to date is that state-enforced \nseparation of races in public schools is discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause. The \nremedy commanded was to dismantle dual school systems.\" \nThe \"state-enforced separation of races\" to which reference is made in the quoted material was not \nfound to exist in the metropolitan Detroit area. While the District Judge made comments about the \nsegregation of the races with reference to the situation existing within the 275*275 City of Detroit as \nrelated to at least some of the suburban communities within the counties of Wayne, Oakland and \nMacomb, which comments have been quoted with approval and adopted by the majority of this \nCourt, we cannot escape the conclusion of the District Judge, as stated in his formal opinion, 345 F. \nSupp. 914, at page 920 (E.D.Mich.1972), where the Court said: \n\"It should be noted that the court has taken no proofs with respect to the establishment of the \nboundaries of the 86 public school districts in the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb, nor on \nthe issue of whether, with the exclusion of the city of Detroit school district, such school districts \nhave committed acts of de jure segregation.\" \nWith such a statement in the record it is beyond the comprehension of this writer to understand how \nthe majority can approve the conclusion of the District Court which requires that at least some of the \n86 public school districts outside the City of Detroit should be embraced within a metropolitan school \ndistrict for the purpose of desegregating the Detroit city schools, the only district which has been \nfound from the evidence to have \"committed acts of de jure segregation.\" Without proof with regard \nto segregatory activities within the other school districts or in regard to district boundaries any \nconclusion by the District Court or by this Court that school district boundaries of other districts had \nthe effect of maintaining or creating unconstitutionally segregated schools within the City of Detroit is \nobviously based on irrelevant, unsubstantial evidence or totally unsupported assumptions. \n\nI am in accord with the application of the statement of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n(though not in the limitation to specific schools) in United States v. Texas Education Agency, 467 \nF.2d 848, at page 883 (5th Cir. 1972), en banc, where the majority opinion quoted the statement \nin Swann that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,\" and then proceeded \nto conclude at page 884: \n\"The power of the district court will depend first upon a finding of the proscribed discrimination in the \nschool system. Swann, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. In determining the fact of \ndiscrimination vel non, whether imposed by statute or as a result of official action, the district court \nmust identify the school or schools which are segregated as a result of such discrimination. This \nidentification must be supported by findings of fact. The importance of such a determination will be \nseen in some populous school districts embracing large geographical areas. There may be \nsegregated schools which are the result of unconstitutional statutes or of official action. There may \nbe other one race schools which are the product of neutral, non-discriminatory forces.\" \nIf we accept the premise that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,\" as \nannounced by the United States Supreme Court, then, clearly, the remedy proposed by the District \nCourt, and approved by a majority of this Court, goes far beyond the \"nature of the violation\" since \nthe District Court has already stated as a conclusion that no evidence was taken as to any violation \nwith regard to any suburban school district. \nWhile the minority in the Texas Education Agency case disapproved of the suggestion of the \nmajority that specific schools within a system must be found to have been segregated, and treated \nseparately, (476 F.2d 888 where the minority speaks through Judge Wisdom), yet the minority does \nnot find nor even suggest that it would be appropriate to expand the order for relief beyond the \nsystem found to have committed acts which violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs in the \naction. \nThrough the majority's opinion runs the thread which holds it together. That thread is the \nunwillingness apparent 276*276 in the minds of the majority to sanction a black school district within \na city which it concludes will be surrounded by white suburbs. While the majority does not now state \nthat such a demographic pattern is inherently unconstitutional, nevertheless, I am persuaded that \nthose who subscribe to the majority opinion are convinced, as stated in the slip opinion of the \noriginal panel, \"big city school systems for blacks surrounded by suburban school systems for whites \ncannot represent equal protection of the law.\" While that statement has been removed from the \nopinion of the majority, yet the premise upon which the statement was obviously based must \nnecessarily form the foundation for the conclusions reached in the majority opinion. It may be that \nsuch will become the law, but such a conclusion should not receive our approval on a record such as \nexists in this case. \nAs has been pointed out in the other opinions, the boundaries of the school district of the City of \nDetroit have been co-terminus with the boundaries of the City of Detroit for more than 100 years. \nThose lines were laid out at a time when there was a minimal black population in the metropolitan \narea of Detroit, if there was such metropolitan area at the time the boundary lines were established. \nThe District Judge and the majority make much of the fact that \"if the boundary lines of the school \ndistricts of the City of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that \nthey could not withstand constitutional challenge.\" This interesting statement provides a fertile field \nfor speculation but certainly has no validity. A proposal to adopt an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States in the same manner and with the same people voting as adopted the Constitution \nof the United States would be stricken immediately. I know of no one who would suggest that \nbecause of changes in the methods of electing the membership of state legislatures that the \n\nConstitution of the United States thereby becomes unconstitutional. The quoted statement is to me a \ncomplete non sequitur. \nI know of no authority which would permit a Court to announce a conclusion, based upon a violation \nof the Constitution, absent the taking of proofs to establish such constitutional violation, which proofs \nthe District Judge stated he did not take in this case. \nAbsent proofs, which clearly were not taken, to establish a violation of the constitutional rights of \nthese plaintiffs by the suburban school district personnel and by the State of Michigan in laying out \nsuburban school district lines it would appear that we are in complete and absolute conflict with the \nprior decisions of this Court. In Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. \n1966), cert. denied 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114 (1967) (Deal I), this Court rejected the \ncontention that the state had an affirmative obligation to balance schools racially (in that case within \nthe City of Cincinnati) \"to counteract the variety of private pressures that now operate to restrict the \nrange of choices presented to each school child.\" 369 F.2d at 59. \nDeal I was cited with approval by this Court in Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac, 443 F.2d \n573 (6th Cir. 1971), cert. denied 404 U.S. 913, 92 S.Ct. 233, 30 L.Ed.2d 186 (1971). The Court said \nat page 575: \n\"Appellants correctly contend that under Deal v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. \n1966), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L. Ed.2d 114 (1967), a school district has no \naffirmative obligation to achieve a balance of the races in the schools when the existing imbalance is \nnot attributable to school policies or practices and is the result of housing patterns and other forces \nover which the school administration had no control.\" \nThe majority, while refusing to overrule Deal I and Davis, creates without evidence an obligation to \nachieve a balance of the races in schools not in a school district but in a metropolitan 277*277 area, \nand does so while denying to the vast majority of the school districts involved in such metropolitan \narea the opportunity to offer evidence to establish that they had not been used for or guilty of any \nsegregative practices. Many other appellate courts have agreed with Deal and Davis. Downs v. \nBoard of Education of Kansas City, 336 F.2d 988, 998 (10th Cir. 1964): \n\"Appellants also contend that even though the Board may not be pursuing a policy of intentional \nsegregation, there is still segregation in fact in the school system and under the principles of Brown \nv. Board of Education, supra, the Board has a positive and affirmative duty to eliminate segregation \nin fact as well as segregation by intention. While there seems to be authority to support that \ncontention, the better rule is that although the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits segregation, it does \nnot command integration of the races in the public schools and Negro children have no constitutional \nright to have white children attend school with them.\" \nKeyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 445 F.2d 990, 1005 (10th Cir. 1971),cert. \ngranted 404 U.S. 1036, 92 S.Ct. 707, 30 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972): \n\"Our reluctance to embark on such a course stems not from a desire to ignore a very serious \neducational and social ill, but from the firm conviction that we are without power to do so. Downs v. \nBoard of Education, 336 F. 2d at 998. Before the power of the federal courts may be invoked in this \nkind of case, a constitutional deprivation must be shown. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. \n483, 493-495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) held that when a state segregates children in public \nschools solely on the basis of race, the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the segregated children are \nviolated. We never construed Brown to prohibit racially imbalanced schools provided they are \nestablished and maintained on racially neutral criteria, and neither have other circuits considering \n\nthe issue. Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. 1966); 419 F.2d 1387 \n(1969); Springfield School Committee v. Barksdale, 348 F.2d 261 (1st Cir. 1965); Bell v.

Board of School Commissioners of City of Indianapolis, Indiana, 474 F.2d 81, 83, 84 \n(7th Cir. 1973): \n\"Appellants first assert that there is no constitutional duty to remedy the effects of racial imbalance or \nto maintain any particular racial balance in the public schools. The Government does not quarrel with \nthis assertion, and, indeed, insofar as it relates to purely de facto segregation, unaided by any state \naction, it is the law of this circuit, Bell v. School City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209 (7th Cir. \n1963), aff'g 213 F.Supp. 819 (N.D. Ind.1963).\" \nA similar prayer for re-districting was before the District Court in Spencer v. Kugler, 326 F.Supp. \n1235 (D.N.J. 1971), and was rejected. The Supreme Court affirmed without opinion, 404 U. S. 1027, \n92 S.Ct. 707, 30 L.Ed.2d 723 (1972) with Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit in Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 467 F.2d 142 (5th \nCir. 1972), en banc, sustained a finding of unconstitutional segregation resulting from a \nneighborhood school policy which effectively segregated Mexican-Americans within a school \ndistrict it did so based upon competent evidence. \nThe majority here announces, \"If school boundary lines cannot be changed for an unconstitutional \npurpose, it follows logically that existing boundary lines cannot be frozen for an unconstitutional \npurpose.\" (P. 251). Again it may be that this will become the law. Clearly, the cases cited have \nreached this conclusion as to the attendance lines existing within a specific school system. I know of \nno case which permits such a 278*278 conclusion as to boundary lines existing between school \ndistricts, and while the conclusion that existing boundary lines cannot be frozen for an \nunconstitutional purpose may flow logically from the premise announced it should be based upon \ncompetent evidence justifying a finding of fact that such boundary lines have been frozen for an \nunconstitutional purpose, and the District Judge in this case announced that he took no evidence on \nthat issue. \nI do not understand how the majority can reach a conclusion as to an appropriate remedy without \nevidence of any violation, particularly when in Deal I and Deal II a contrary conclusion has been \nreached. As stated at 369 F.2d, page 59: \n\"If the state or any of its agencies has not adopted impermissible racial criteria in its treatment of \nindividuals then there is no violation of the Constitution.\" \nand again in Davis this Court framed the issues as follows: \n\"Accordingly, the principal question before us is whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to \nsupport the determination of the District Judge that appellants are responsible for the existing racial \nimbalance in the Pontiac School System.\" 443 F.2d at 575. (Emphasis supplied). \nand in responding to that issue this Court said: \n\"Although, as the District Court stated, each decision considered alone might not compel the \nconclusion that the Board of Education intended to foster segregation, taken together, they support \n\nthe conclusion that a purposeful pattern of racial discrimination has existed in the Pontiac school \nsystem for at least 15 years.\" 443 F.2d at 576. \nThus, the cases in this Court, prior to this case, appear conclusively to have been decided on the \nbasis of discriminatory intent, and unless we specifically reverse our previous decisions we cannot \nreach the conclusion announced by the majority in a case where the District Court specifically stated \nthat it did not take any evidence to establish any discriminatory intent on the part of the suburban \nschool districts who were not parties to the action or on the part of the State in the structure of the \nsuburban school districts. \nOther circuits have also required the establishment of a discriminatory intent.

But see: United States v. Texas Education Agency, \n467 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1972). \nThe evidence in regard to building of school buildings within the City of Detroit and lack of state aid \nfor transportation of pupils within the City of Detroit may have demonstrated that these factors \ncontributed to racial segregation within the City of Detroit. Clearly, if the Court took no proofs with \nrespect to the commission of acts causing segregation of the races as between the City of Detroit \nand the suburban school districts it would be inappropriate to include those school districts within \nany remedy to be adopted to eliminate segregation within the City of Detroit. The cases cited by the \nDistrict Court and by the majority of this Court are inapplicable. In each case cited the school district \ninvolved and against which a remedial order was granted was found to have been guilty of \nsegregative practices. In every instance, as we read the cases, that finding was supported by \nsubstantial evidence after an adversary 279*279 proceeding in which all the interested parties were \nrepresented. Such is not the case here. \nIt seems obvious to me that the majority and the District Court have become confused and are \nunable to distinguish between violation and remedy. As stated by the District Court no evidence was \ntaken as to any violation in the fixing of the boundaries of the suburban school systems nor as to any \nviolation because of the relationship between the suburban school systems and the schools of the \nCity of Detroit. \nThe errors to which we have already alluded were brought about by the failure on the part of the \nDistrict Court to require that all interested parties be brought into the case at the earliest appropriate \nmoment. A review of this record reveals that on March 22, 1971, a group of white Detroit residents, \nwho were parents of children enrolled in the Detroit public schools, were permitted to intervene as \nparties defendant. On June 24, 1971, the District Judge alluded to the possibility of a metropolitan \nschool system, App. Vol. IV, pgs. 259, 260, and in that connection stated: \"As I have said to several \nwitnesses in this case: how do you desegregate a black city, or a black school system.\" App. Vol. IV, \npg. 260. Subsequently, and on July 17, 1971, the white parents filed a motion in an effort to require \nthe joinder of the 85 suburban school districts as parties defendant and gave the following reasons: \n\"1. That said suburban school districts are agents of the State of Michigan and subject to the \njurisdiction and supervision of the State Board of Education. \n\"2. That said school districts are white segregated school districts. \n\n\"3. That questions of law and fact common to the defendant, School District of the City of Detroit, \nand proposed additional suburban school districts have been presented to this Court. \n\"4. In the event that this Court rules for the plaintiff, in the absence of joinder of the proposed school \ndistricts, complete relief cannot be awarded the plaintiff, and in addition would impose an \nunconstitutional burden on the intervening defendant, in that the resulting school district of the City of \nDetroit would be and will remain as established by the proofs already submitted an inferior school \ndistrict.\" App. I at 142-3. \nThe trial court did not rule upon this motion, but in the course of the proceedings discussed it in \nSeptember, 1971, and concluded that the motion should not be considered at that time because \"in \nconsidering the motion to add the listed school districts we pause to note that the proposed action \nhas to do with relief.\" App. Vol. I, pg. 215, 338 F. Supp. 582, at 595. \nBetween February 9 and February 17, 1972, four parties, Grosse Pointe Public Schools, Allen Park \nPublic Schools, et al.,[1] Southfield Public Schools and the School District for the City of Royal Oak, \nmade motions for leave to intervene. These motions were finally granted on March 15, 1972, during \nthe second day of hearing on the plans for desegregation involving only the Detroit school system. \nIntervention, according to the District Judge, was permitted under Rule 24(a), \"Intervention of Right,\" \nand also under Rule 24(b), \"Permissive Intervention.\" Before permitting such intervention and on \nMarch 6, 1972, the District Judge set up a timetable for the consideration of plans already submitted, \nwhich timetable was as follows: \n\"1. Hearing on desegregation intra-city plans will proceed, beginning at 10:00 a. m., Tuesday, March \n14, 1972. \n\"2. Recommendations for `conditions' of intervention to be submitted not later than 10:00 a. m., \nMarch 14, 1972. \n280*280 \"3. Briefs on propriety of metropolitan remedy to be submitted not later than March 22, \n1972. \n\"4. Tentatively and unless the court rules otherwise, hearings on metropolitan remedy to commence \n10:00 a. m., March 28, 1972.\" App. I at 397. \nWhen intervention was granted, the District Judge placed strict limitations upon the part which the \nintervenors would be permitted to play. The order provides: \n\"The interventions granted this day shall be subject to the following conditions: \n1. No intervenor will be permitted to assert any claim or defense previously adjudicated by the court. \n2. No intervenor shall reopen any question or issue which has previously been decided by the court. \n3. The participation of the intervenors considered this day shall be subordinated to that of the original \nparties and previous intervenors. \n4. The new intervenors shall not initiate discovery proceedings except by permission of the court \nupon application in writing, accompanied by a showing that no present party plans to or is willing to \nundertake the particular discovery sought and that the particular matter to be discovered is relevant \nto the current stage of the proceedings. \n5. No new intervenor shall be permitted to seek a delay of any proceeding in this cause; and he shall \nbe bound by the brief and hearing schedule established by the court's Notice to Counsel, issued \nMarch 6, 1972. \n6. New intervenors will not file counterclaims or cross-complaints; nor will they be permitted to seek \nthe joinder of additional parties or the dismissal of present parties, except upon a showing that such \naction will not result in delay. \n7. New intervenors are granted intervention for two principal purposes: (a) To advise the court, by \nbrief, of the legal propriety or impropriety of considering a metropolitan plan; (b) To review any plan \nor plans for the desegregation of the so-called larger Detroit Metropolitan area, and submitting \n\nobjections, modifications or alternatives to it or them, and in accordance with the requirements of the \nUnited States Constitution and the prior orders of this court. \n8. New intervenors shall present evidence, if any they have, through witnesses to a number to be \nset, and limited, if necessary, by the court, following conference. \n9. With regard to the examination of witnesses, all new intervenors shall among themselves select \none attorney per witness to act for them, unless one or more of the new intervenors show cause \notherwise. \nThese conditions of intervention shall remain subject to change or modification by the court in the \ninterest of timely disposition of the case.\" App. Ia 408-410. \nWe point out that the intervening school districts (42 out of 85) came into the case while the court \nwas already considering the Detroit only plans, were permitted a total of less than one week to \nprepare briefs in regard to a metropolitan remedy, and found themselves faced with a ruling \nfavorable to the consideration of such remedy within two days after the date on which their briefs \nwere due. All of this despite the fact that an effort had been made to bring the suburban school \ndistricts into the case almost eight months prior to the rulings in regard to the Detroit only plans and \nthe metropolitan plan. The majority finds no fault with this timetable. It affirms the conclusions of the \nDistrict Court in regard to the Detroit 281*281 only plan and the need for a metropolitan plan without \naffording to the suburban school districts any opportunity to be heard. \nThose suburban school districts which are not yet parties to this action, 43 in number, have had no \nopportunity to be heard with respect to any alleged constitutional violation within their respective \nschool districts or with respect to the existence of their respective school district boundaries. Of \ncourse, the pleadings do not assert any such violations but under the majority opinion a remedy will \nbe imposed which will drastically affect the future schooling of their children without granting to them \nany opportunity to be heard with regard to any reasons which might support the adoption of such a \nremedy. The suburban school districts which were belatedly made parties to this action assert that \nbecause they have not been afforded the opportunity to offer evidence to demonstrate that they \nhave not been guilty of any constitutional violation they have been denied the fundamental \nrequirements of due process. The response of the appellee to the claimed rights of the suburban \nschool districts is that there is no denial of \"life, liberty or property\" within the meaning of the Fifth \nAmendment. They also claim that the interests of the suburban school districts were adequately \nrepresented by \"their parent state defendant.\" \nAn examination of the record in this case will effectively dispose of any claim that the interests of the \nsuburban school districts were represented by the state defendants. Clearly, the state defendants \nwere defending against the claims of the plaintiffs that the state had by its actions created racial \nsegregation within the school district of the City of Detroit. As I examine the record it does not \nappear that any defendant felt compelled to offer evidence in defense of an unasserted claim that \nthe existence of suburban school districts was without other evidence a violation of the constitutional \nrights of the students in the schools of the City of Detroit. Had the state defendants comprehended \nthat the District Court intended to impose a metropolitan school district upon the schools of three \ncounties the writer is confident that they would have joined in the earlier motion to require the \nsuburban school districts to be named as parties defendant. \nAs to the first argument of the appellees it is clear from the language of the Court in Bolling v. \nSharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954), that the segregation of schools is a denial \nof due process within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. If segregation is a denial of the Fifth \nAmendment due process then clearly orders eliminating such segregation are a part of the due \nprocess rights. In that case the Court said: \n\n\"Although the Court has not assumed to define `liberty' with any great precision, that term is not \nconfined to mere freedom from bodily restraint. Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct \nwhich the individual is free to pursue, * * *.\" 347 U.S. at 499, 74 S.Ct. at 694. \nEven earlier, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), the \nSupreme Court found a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in matters relating to the liberty of \nparents to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. Had we any doubt, it \nwould have been settled in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 \n(1972), where the Court permitted parents to withdraw their children from the state public school \nsystem and found a constitutional right in parents to control the upbringing and religious training of \ntheir children. That the right under the Fifth Amendment applies to the states was recognized \nin Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, at page 482, 85 S.Ct. 1678 at page 1680, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 \n(1965), where the court noted: \n\"By Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, the right to educate one's children as one chooses is made \napplicable 282*282 to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" \nBeing convinced that the interest of parents in the education of their children represents a right \nprotected by the Constitution as to all parents and not only those parents whose children are \nrequired to attend segregated schools, we then reach the question of the application of due process \nto that right. \nAs pointed out by the Court in Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 \nL.Ed.2d 62 (1965): \n\"A fundamental requirement of due process is `the opportunity to be heard.' * * * It is an opportunity \nwhich must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\" \nand in greater detail we find the same principal in Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 377-378, 91 \nS.Ct. 780, 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), where Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, stated: \n\"Prior cases establish, first, that due process requires, at a minimum, that absent a countervailing \nstate interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through \nthe judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Early in our jurisprudence, \nthis Court voiced the doctrine that `[w]herever one is assailed in his person or his property, there he \nmay defend,' Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274, 277, 23 L.Ed. 914 (1876). See Baldwin v. Hale, 1 \nWall. 223, 17 L.Ed. 531 (1864); Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409, 17 S.Ct. 841, 42 L.Ed. 215 (1897). \nThe theme that `due process of law signifies a right to be heard in one's defense,' Hovey v. \nElliott, supra, at 417, 17 S. Ct. 841,has continually recurred in the years since Baldwin, \nWindsor, and Hovey.Although `[m]any controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract \nwords of the Due Process Clause,' as Mr. Justice Jackson wrote for the Court in Mullane v. Central \nHanover Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), `there can be no doubt that at a \nminimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by \nnotice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.'\" Id., at 313, 70 S.Ct. 656. \nThus, each party to a lawsuit should be advised as to the claims asserted by the other parties to the \nlawsuit and have an opportunity to be heard in respect to all such claims. \nIn this case no pleading has ever been filed suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of any suburban \nschool district, none suggesting that the suburban schools and the schools of the City of Detroit \nconstituted a dual school system or even intimating any possibility of a need for a metropolitan \nschool district to eliminate the segregated conditions alleged to have existed in the schools of the \n\nCity of Detroit. We can only speculate upon the timing of the first suggestion of a metropolitan district \nbut it appears that the District Judge seized upon the suggestion without requiring any amendments \nto the pleadings or the adding of any parties. \nI question whether the suburban school districts have any interest in being heard as to the claim of \nsegregation within the City of Detroit, and there can be no question as to the right of the trial court to \nplace certain limitations upon the part which any intervening school district would be permitted to \nplay. Had all of this, in regard to metropolitan school districts, come up at the eleventh hour as \nsuggested by the appellees one might, although it is doubtful, accept the conditions imposed by the \nDistrict Judge. Such was not the case here. The motion to require the joinder of the suburban school \ndistricts was made almost eight months before consideration was given to the Detroit only plans. \nThe Advisory Committee on the Rules anticipated that limitations and conditions 283*283might be \nplaced upon intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a): \n\"An intervention of right under the amended rule may be subject to appropriate conditions or \nrestrictions responsive among other things to the requirements of efficient conduct of the \nproceedings.\" 3B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 24.01 [10], at 24-18 (2d Ed.). \nand see also Galbreath v. Metropolitan Trust Co. of California, 134 F.2d 569, 570 (10th Cir. \n1943); Chavis v. Whitcomb, 305 F.Supp. 1359, 1363 (S.D.Ind. 1969). The situation in this case is \npointed up by the language found at 3B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 24.16 [4], 2d Ed. \n\"It would be meaningless to give him an absolute right to intervene in order to protect his interest, if \nonce in the proceeding he were barred from raising questions necessary to his own protection.\" \nWhat we have said in regard to intervention under Rule 24 sets forth without the necessity of \nrepetition those matters which should be considered by any court in determining the part which is to \nbe played by one who is joined as a party under Rule 19, as well as one who intervenes as a party, \naspects of this case which are almost completely ignored by the majority and the District Court. \nIn conclusion I am constrained to say that I do not suggest that a metropolitan remedy is totally \nbeyond the realm of consideration in this case upon an appropriate record. My whole purpose in \nwriting this opinion is to point out that the majority and the District Court have fallen into a state of \nconfusion in failing to distinguish between violation and remedy and in failing to recognize the \nnecessity for the finding of violation before the trial court embarks upon that broad field of equity \nwhich permits a trial judge to devise a remedy which will adequately overcome the violation \npreviously found to be in existence. I have also written because I am satisfied that the District Judge \nin failing to consider the necessity for joining the suburban school districts pursuant to a motion filed \nmore than a year before the disposition of the case was in error. The suggestion by the District Court \nthat the suburban school districts were only involved in the remedy points up the trap into which both \nthe District Court and the majority of this Court have fallen in failing to recognize the necessity for \nfinding a violation before a remedy may be imposed. \nI would reverse the District Court and remand the case with instructions to require the joinder of the \nsuburban school districts of the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb with permission to the \nrepresentatives of those districts, with reasonable limitations, to participate in all aspects of this \nlawsuit which may affect the suburban school districts, and with particular attention to the necessity \nfor finding a constitutional violation which would justify the imposition of a metropolitan remedy. \nWILLIAM E. MILLER, Circuit Judge (dissenting). \n\nIt is my firm conviction that it is premature at this time for the Court to adjudicate any of the questions \narising from the various orders of the district court from which this appeal is taken. This is true for the \nreason that school districts and parties to be affected by a metropolitan plan or remedy have not \nbeen afforded an opportunity to be heard or to present evidence upon all of the issues involved. \nThe majority opinion does indeed state: \nOn remand, any party against whom relief is sought, including school districts which heretofore have \nintervened and school districts which hereafter may become parties to this litigation, shall be \nafforded an opportunity to offer additional evidence, and to cross-examine available witnesses who \npreviously have testified, on any issue raised by the pleadings, including amendments thereto, as \nmay 284*284 be relevant and admissible to such issues. The District Court may consider any \nevidence now on file and such additional competent evidence as may be introduced by any party. \nThe effect of this conclusion is, in my opinion, vitiated by the two succeeding sentences: \nHowever, the District Court will not be required to receive any additional evidence as to the matters \ncontained in its Ruling on the Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, and reported at 338 \nF.Supp. 582, or its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on the \"Detroit-only\" plans of \ndesegregation, dated March 28, 1972. We hold that the findings of fact contained in these rulings are \nnot clearly erroneous, Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., but to the contrary are supported by substantial \nevidence. \nParties to be affected and against whom relief is sought should be accorded, in compliance with \nbasic principles of due process, an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \nmanner not only with respect to the ultimate scope of the remedy to be fashioned, but also with \nrespect to important, significant and perhaps even controlling issues, including the issue of \nsegregation, a \"Detroit only\" school plan and the propriety of a metropolitan remedy. If any one of \nthese issues is resolved in favor of parties outside the Detroit School District, the nature and scope \nof a remedy embracing outlying districts would not be reached. Hence the outlying districts have a \nvital interest in each issue separately and should be heard on each in a true adversary sense. Until \nthis is done our expression of view on the merits of the several questions is uncalled for and ill-\nadvised. To permit these additional parties to be heard only in the restricted sense set forth in the \nmajority opinion is to deny them basic rights guaranteed not only by Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, but by the Constitution itself. \nI would, therefore, vacate all orders appealed from the district court, remand the action for the \njoinder of all parties to be affected, and direct the district court to afford the parties a proper \nopportunity to be heard and to present evidence on the issues indicated above. \n[1] M.S.A. § 15.3252(c), M.C.L.A. § 340.252(c). \n[2] M.S.A. § 15.3575, M.C.L.A. § 340575. \n[3] M.S.A. §§ 15.1023(10)(a), 15.3570 M.C.L.A. §§ 388.1010(a), 340.570. \n[4] M.S.A. §§ 15.1951, 15.3361, M.C.L.A. §§ 388.371, 340.361; M.S.A. §§ 15.3781-15.3782, M.C.L.A. §§ 340.781-340.782; \nM.S.A. § 9.2511(c), M.C.L.A. § 257.811(c). \n[5] M.S.A. § 15.3732(g), M.C.L.A. § 340.732(g). \n[6] M.S.A. § 15.3789, M.C.L.A. § 340.789. \n\n[7] M.S.A. § 15.3612, M.C.L.A. § 340.612; M.S.A. §§ 15.3616, 15.3688, M.C.L.A. §§ 340.616, 340.688. \n[8] M.S.A. § 15.3887(1), M.C.L.A. § 340.887(1). \n[9] M.S.A. § 15.3402, M.C.L.A. § 340.402. \n[10] M.S.A. § 15.3431, M.C.L.A. § 340.431. \n[11] M.S.A. § 15.3447, M.C.L.A. § 340.447. \n[12] M.S.A. § 15.3567(1), M.C.L.A. § 340.567(a). \n[13] M.S.A. § 15.1961, M.C.L.A. § 388.851, Op.Atty.Gen.

The plan seeks to achieve a racial \nbalance or quota in each public school in the system of 75% white and 25% black in a state which is 87% white and 13% \nblack. The Plan violates Public Acts of Michigan, 1867, Act 34 § 28, by ordering children living in one district to attend school \nin another district. \n[2] The Supreme Court in Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), has since held that \nSection 1982 of 42 U.S.C. applies to all discrimination in the sale or rental of property. \nThe majority distinguishes Deal I on the ground that the District Court made findings of fact that there had been no \nunconstitutional conduct on the part of the Cincinnati Board of Education. In Bradley, the District Judge had found similar \nfacts to constitute a violation of the Constitution. Both District Court decisions, although inconsistent, have now been \naffirmed. \n[3] Indeed, there is no finding by the District Court of any pattern of purposeful segregation by the School Board or finding of \nany causal relationship between any alleged segregative acts of the Board of Education and the concentration of blacks in \nthe inner city. \n[4] At the National Black Political Convention held in Gary, Indiana (March, 1972), mandatory busing and school integration \nwere condemned as racist and as preserving a black minority structure. \n[5] Of course, merely because equal protection is an individual right does not mean, as implied in United States v. Jefferson \nCo. Bd. of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), that a class action will not be available under Rule 23(a) for redress of \ndiscrimination. A class action lies where a number of persons have similar individual rights infringed. \nOn the other hand, it does not follow that simply because a class action is available to redress discrimination individual rights \ncan be obliterated by superimposing the \"rights\" of the class. \nThe individual plaintiffs, who charge in their Complaint the maintenance of a desegregated school system in Detroit, were all \nNegroes except one. Nevertheless, the District Court in determining the class held \"that the plaintiffs in their action represent \nall school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age, . . ..\" \nThus white and black children and their parents, who are not situated similarly with the plaintiffs and may violently disagree \nwith plaintiffs' position, are arbitrarily placed in the same class. It will also be noted that the Complaint sought only the \ndesegregation of the Detroit schools and made no claim against other counties and other school districts. \n[6] \"The interventions granted this day shall be subject to the following conditions: \n1. No intervenor will be permitted to assert any claim or defense previously adjudicated by the court. \n2. No intervenor shall reopen any question or issue which has previously been decided by the court. \n3. The participation of the intervenors considered this day shall be subordinated to that of the original parties and previous \nintervenors. \n\n4. The new intervenors shall not initiate discovery proceedings except by permission of the court upon application in writing, \naccompanied by a showing that no present party plans to or is willing to undertake the particular discovery sought and that \nthe particular matter to be discovered is relevant to the current stage of the proceedings. \n5. No new intervenor shall be permitted to seek a delay of any proceeding in this cause; and he shall be bound by the brief \nand hearing schedule established by the court's Notice to Counsel, issued March 6, 1972. \n6. New intervenors will not file counterclaims or cross-complaints; nor will they be permitted to seek the joinder of additional \nparties or the dismissal of present parties, except upon a showing that such action will not result in delay. \n7. New intervenors are granted intervention for two principal purposes: (a) To advise the court, by brief, of the legal propriety \nor impropriety of considering a metropolitan plan; (b) to review any plan or plans for the desegregation of the so-called larger \nDetroit Metropolitan area, and submitting objections, modifications or alternatives to it or them, and in accordance with the \nrequirements of the United States Constitution and the prior orders of this court. \n8. New intervenors shall present evidence, if any they have, through witnesses to a number to be set, and limited, if \nnecessary, by the court, following conference. \n9. With regard to the examination of witnesses, all new intervenors shall among themselves select one attorney per witness \nto act for them, unless one or more of the new intervenors show cause otherwise. These conditions of intervention shall \nremain subject to change or modification by the court in the interest of timely disposition of the case. \nDATE: March 15, 1972.\" App. at 408-410. \n[7] Judge Roth's language is not understandable in view of the 1869 decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in People, \nex rel. Workman v. Board of Education of Detroit, supra, upholding the right of Negro children to attend any school in their \ndistrict. \n[8] The orders entered by the District Court have certainly been expended on the public treasury, have interfered with public \nadministration, have restrained the State from acting, and have compelled it to act, which is the test for determining whether \nthe action is against the State, under Dugan v. Rank, supra. Such an action is clearly proscribed by the Eleventh \nAmendment. \n[1] Editorial, \"Discrimination by HEW,\" New York Times, March 2, 1972. \n[1] The others referred to included 38 additional suburban school districts. \n ",

INTRODUCTION \nOur task in this on-going litigation is to formulate a just, equitable and feasible plan to desegregate \nthe Detroit School System, taking account of the practicalities at hand. We do so in response to a \nUnited States Supreme Court mandate that we formulate a \"decree directed to eliminating the \nsegregation found to exist in Detroit City Schools.\" Writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, \nChief Justice Burger noted that the district court and court of appeals: \n\"proceeded on an assumption that the Detroit schools could not be truly desegregated — in their \nview of what constituted desegregation — unless the racial composition of the student body of each \nschool substantially reflected the racial composition of the population of the metropolitan area . . \n..\" Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 740, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3125, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). \nThe Chief Justice then pointed out that Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 554 (1971) \"does not require any particular racial balance in each `school, grade or \nclassroom.' . . .\" 418 U.S. at 740-41, 94 S.Ct. at 3125. Thus, the Court did not deem it essential to \nfurnish guidelines for desegregating the Detroit School System. Cf. Keyes v. School District No. 1, \n\nDenver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). Rather, it left this court to \ndetermine what constitutes desegregation in this particular school district. \nIn our analysis, we have been mindful that rigid and inflexible desegregation plans too often neglect \nto treat school children as individuals, instead treating them as pigmented pawns to be shuffled \nabout and counted solely to achieve an abstraction called \"racial mix.\" We recognize that our \nconcern is with the very young and that a just, equitable and feasible desegregation plan should not \ndestroy the educational mission of the schools they attend. We are aware of the adverse educational \nand psychological impact upon black children compelled to attend segregated schools; to separate \nthem from other children solely because of skin pigmentation is 1102*1102 indeed invidious. But \nalthough the resulting injury is great, the remedy devised should not inflict sacrifices or penalties \nupon other innocent children as punishment for the constitutional violations exposed. We must bear \nin mind that since those committing the grotesque violations are no longer about, any such \npunishment or sacrifices would fall upon the very young; it is the children for whom the remedy is \nfashioned who must bear the additional burdens. \nThe necessity of preserving the educational system for whom this remedy is addressed has \ncompelled us to scrutinize carefully plans that are rigidly structured to achieve a racial mix, that \ninclude pairing and clustering of schools, that fracture grade structures and that include massive \ntransportation. All of these techniques require children to spend more time going to school and divert \neducational dollars and energy from legitimate educational concerns. \nIf Detroit's school population were more equally divided between black and white or if the \ndesegregation area were sufficiently large to permit greater equalization, it would be possible to \ndiminish the inevitable limitations on the task of eliminating racially identifiable schools in the district. \nBut it is impossible to avoid having a substantial number of all black or nearly all black schools in a \nschool district that is over 70% black. The truth of this statement is best demonstrated by the \ndesegregation plan offered by the plaintiffs in this litigation; while plaintiffs contend that their plan \naffords the greatest degree of desegregation, their plan leaves the majority of the schools in the \ndistrict between 75% and 90% black. An appropriate desegregation plan must carefully balance the \ncosts of desegregation techniques against the possible results to be achieved. Where the benefits to \nbe gained are negligible, those techniques should be adopted sparingly. \nFinally, an effective and feasible remedy must prevent resegregation at all costs. To ignore the \npossibility of resegregation would risk further injury to Detroit school children, both black and white. \nIn a school district that is only 26% white, a remedy that does not take account of the possibility of \nresegregation will be short-lived and useless if that percentage of whites further decreased. A \nrealistic desegregation plan should recognize that abuses such as optional attendance zones, \ngerrymandered attendance zones, discriminatory assignments, the bussing of black children away \nfrom closer white schools and school construction that knowingly tends to have segregative effects \nare unlikely to recur in a school system that has a majority black board of education and a bi-racial \nadministrative staff. \nThe guidelines adopted by this court consider the \"practicalities of the situation\", and at the same \ntime make \"every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation . . ..\" Davis \nv. School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 37, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 1292, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). \nThe \"practicalities\" that an appropriate remedy should consider encompass the legitimate concerns \nof the school system and the community at large. One legitimate concern deserving of weight is the \nundesirability of forced reassignment of students achieving only negligible desegregative results. \nAnother of the practicalities is the shifting demography occurring naturally in the school district \ntogether with the persistent increase in black student enrollment. Still another of the practicalities to \nbe taken into account is the racial population of the district, which is predominantly black by a wide \n\nmargin. Further practicalities that must be considered by this court include the declining tax base of \nthe City of Detroit, the depressed economy of the city, and the volatile atmosphere created by the \nhighest rate of unemployment in the nation. Finally, the decree must consider the overriding \ncommunity concern for the quality of educational services available in the school district. An effective \nand flexible remedy must contain safeguards that will enhance rather 1103*1103 than destroy the \nquality of the educational services provided in the City of Detroit. \nII. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS \nThe Detroit School Desegregation case has been in litigation for nearly five years. The plaintiffs filed \nthis action on August 18, 1970, naming as defendants the Detroit Board of Education, its members \nand the Detroit Superintendent of Schools, together with the Governor, Attorney General, State \nBoard of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Michigan. The \ncomplaint alleged inter alia that as a result of actions and inactions on the part of all the named \ndefendants, the Detroit Public School System was racially segregated. The complaint further \nchallenged the constitutionality of Act 48 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1970 insofar as that Act \nprecluded implementation of the April 7, 1970, \"plan\" to desegregate the Detroit Public Schools. The \nplaintiffs further prayed for a preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of Act 48 together \nwith an order requiring the Detroit Board of Education to implement the so-called April 7, 1970, \ndesegregation plan. \nThe district court ruled that plaintiffs were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief and declined to \nrule on the constitutionality of Act 48. At that time the district court granted a motion dismissing the \naction as to the Governor and the Attorney General. (Rulings dated September 3, 1970.) Upon \nappeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit sustained the district court's denial of \nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction but reversed the district court in part, holding that \nportions of Act 48 were unconstitutional and at the same time ordering that the Governor and the \nAttorney General remain as parties to the litigation. Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir. 1970). \nAlthough the defendant Detroit Board of Education would have implemented the so-called April 7 \ndesegregation plan upon order of the court or otherwise, the district court did not order \nimplementation of such \"plan\"; instead as an interim plan, it adopted a plan submitted by the Detroit \nBoard known as the \"Magnet Plan.\" (December 3, 1970, Ruling on School Plans.) \nFollowing a trial on the liability issue, the district court found that the Detroit School District was \nsegregated on the basis of race. The court found that certain conduct on the part of the defendant \nDetroit Board of Education and the defendant State of Michigan, through its various state officials, \nfostered segregation in the Detroit Public School System and violated the Fourteenth Amendment \nrights of Detroit school children. The district court also held that the state was vicariously liable for \ncertain de jure acts of the defendant Detroit Board of Education. The district court specifically found \nthat the state failed until 1971 to provide funds for the transportation of pupils within the Detroit \nSchool System regardless of their poverty or distance from the school to which they were assigned, \nalthough at the same time the state provided financial assistance for student transportation to many \nneighboring, mostly white suburban districts. The district court finally found that the state, through \nAct 48, acted to \"impede, delay and minimize racial integration in Detroit schools.\" 338 F.Supp. 582 \nat 589. \nThe district court thereafter ordered the parties to submit plans to desegregate the Detroit Public \nSchools. Pursuant to this order the defendant Detroit Board of Education submitted two plans, \nreferred to as Plan A and Plan C, that were restricted to the corporate limits of the City of Detroit. At \nthe same time the plaintiffs filed a desegregation plan known as the \"Foster Plan\" and the State \ndefendants filed a \"Metropolitan School District Reorganization Plan.\" Following the hearings \nconducted on the Detroit-only plan, the district court concluded that the Detroit Board of Education \n\nPlans A and C were legally insufficient because they would not significantly 1104*1104 desegregate \nthe school system: The court found that Plan A was an elaboration and extension of the Magnet \nPlan then in effect and further found that Plan C as submitted by the Detroit Board was merely a \ntoken desegregation effort. The district court also rejected the plan submitted by plaintiffs, \nspecifically finding that plaintiffs' plan would entail a re-casting of the entire Detroit School System \nand would leave the majority of its schools 75 to 95% black, thus making the Detroit School System \nmore identifiably black. The district court then concluded as a matter of law that \"under the evidence \nin this case [it] is inescapable that relief of segregation in the public schools in the City of Detroit \ncannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city.\" The Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling on the issue of segregation and its Findings of \nFact and Conclusions of Law on the Detroit-only plan. The court further affirmed in principle the \npropriety of a metropolitan remedy. Following a grant of certiorari to the Court of Appeals, the \nSupreme Court, on July 25, 1974, affirmed the district court's finding on the liability issue of \nsegregation and did not disturb the court's finding that the Detroit Public Schools could not be \nadequately desegregated within the corporate limits of the city but reversed the court's approval of a \nmetropolitan remedy, holding that a district court may not impose a multi-district remedy to correct a \nsingle school district's acts of de jure segregation. \nOn January 13, 1975, upon receipt of the Supreme Court mandate from the Court of Appeals, this \ncourt filed an order requiring the parties to file a current status report. This order precipitated the \nfiling of numerous motions to dismiss by the intervening suburban defendants. Following a pre-trial \nconference on February 18, 1975, the defendant Detroit Board and the plaintiffs were ordered to \nsubmit desegregation plans for Detroit only, on or before April 1, 1975. The State defendants were \nordered to submit a critique of the Detroit Board plan by April 20, 1975. On April 16, 1975, the court \ngranted the motions to dismiss filed by the intervening suburban defendants and simultaneously \ngranted plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to include allegations of inter-district de \njureviolations. \nThe plan submitted by the Detroit Board contained many components that were vague or poorly \ndocumented. Costs for these components, including transportation, were excessive. The defendant \nDetroit Board sought to add 3,416 new employees, many at salaries well in excess of those paid to \nits more experienced and tenured teachers. Moreover, the plan failed to inform the court of the \nextent to which each of the components might presently exist in the school system. When these \ndeficiencies became apparent, the court deemed it advisable to appoint three court experts and \ncommissioned them as officers of the court to obtain much of the needed information. The court \nassigned its experts to obtain from the Detroit Board sufficient data to evaluate the components \nincluded in the plan. Because the constitutional sufficiency of the defendant Board's plan could be \ndetermined only by examining all of the alternatives, the court deemed it necessary to request its \nexperts to explore additional possibilities to aid the court's evaluation of the transportation \ncomponent. The hearings on both plans commenced on April 29, 1975. \nWe now detail the findings of fact in order to determine the amount of desegregation possible in this \nschool district, giving due consideration to the practicalities at hand. We are reminded that, \naccording to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 \n(1954), this court is to be guided by equitable principles. Thus, its guidelines must be flexible and \nresponsive to public and private needs. \nIII. FINDINGS OF FACT \nA. The Detroit School System \n\n1. The Detroit School System, which is coterminous with the City of Detroit, 1105*1105 is governed \nby a Central Board of Education. In an attempt to decentralize this huge school system the Michigan \nlegislature, pursuant to Act 48 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1970 (Mich. Comp.Laws 388.171 et \nseq.) divided the school system into eight geographic \"regions\". Each region is governed by a \nregional board of education whose primary responsibilities and relationship with the central Board of \nEducation are outlined in Defendant Board of Education's Exhibit 4, \"Guidelines for \nDecentralization\". Each region has a five-member board elected by the citizens residing within its \nboundaries. The individual board member receiving the highest number of votes is designated \nchairman of the regional board. \nThe Central Board of Education consists of 13 members. Five of its members are elected from the \nCity of Detroit at large and the remaining positions are occupied by the eight regional chairmen. The \nday-to-day administration of the entire school system is the responsibility of a General \nSuperintendent of Schools, an Executive Deputy Superintendent, a Deputy Superintendent and an \nAssistant Superintendent, together with eight Regional Superintendents selected by the regional \nboards. The \"Guidelines for Decentralization\" indicate that there is much autonomy left with the \nregional boards. For example, the regional boards retain the authority to change attendance \nboundaries within their regions, transfer teachers from school to school within their regions, vary the \neducational curriculum in schools within their regions and hire the Regional Superintendents. Under \nthe regional system the quality of education could vary not only among regions but also among \nschools within a region. Notwithstanding this decentralized system, the Central Board of Education \nremains responsible for governing the entire system and for overseeing the actions of the regional \nboards. \n2. Both the Central Board and the central administrative staff under the supervision of the General \nSuperintendent are bi-racial in character. Nine of the Central Board's thirteen members, including the \nBoard President, are black; the other four members are white. At the beginning of this remedial \nhearing the General Superintendent was white and the Executive Deputy Superintendent was black; \nwhen these proceedings were completed the white General Superintendent had retired and had \nbeen replaced by one who is black. The bi-racial aspects of the school administration extend \nthroughout the entire staff, down to the level of the department heads. \nThe racial composition of the school administration has changed dramatically since the inception of \nthis lawsuit in 1970. At the conclusion of the trial on the liability aspects of this litigation in 1971, the \nCentral Board was composed of ten white members and three black members and the greater part \nof the General Superintendent's staff was white. As a result of the decentralization brought about by \nthe passage of Act 48, the black community has become more involved in and has experienced \ngreater control over the Detroit School System. \n3. Although the Supreme Court decision in this case was handed down in July of 1974, the Detroit \nBoard of Education did not take steps to formulate a desegregation plan until ordered to do so by \nthis court. In January of 1975, however, they created a desegregation office commissioned to \nformulate an acceptable plan. The Detroit Board's plan, submitted to this Court on April 1, 1975, was \nadopted by a 9-4 vote. The nine black members of the Board voted in favor of the desegregation \nplan while the four white members opposed the plan as presented. Although this vote was split along \nracial lines, the central Board of Education is nevertheless a cooperative Board and is willing to \ndesegregate the Detroit school system. However, the plan as submitted does not enjoy unanimous \nacceptance among the members of the Detroit Board, the members of the administrative staff or the \nmembers of the desegregation office. It is apparent that under the regional system it is \npossible 1106*1106 that the degree of desegregation under the Board's plan could vary among \ndifferent regions and it is likely that the plan as submitted by the Central Board of Education enjoys \nvarying degrees of acceptance in different regions. \n\nB. Statistical and Demographic Data \n4. The most recent official racial-ethnic distribution count, taken on September 27, 1974, discloses \nthat there are 257,396 students enrolled in the Detroit Public Schools. Of this number 71.5% are \nblack and 26.4% are white, while 2.1% is comprised of other ethnic groups. In the Detroit School \nSystem's regular K-12 program 247,113 students are enrolled, of which 71.4% are black and 28.6% \nis comprised of white and other ethnic groups. In the elementary schools, grades K-6, 141,806 \nstudents are enrolled, of which 72.3% are black and 27.7% is comprised of white and other ethnic \ngroups. In the junior high schools, grades 7-8, 39,600 students are enrolled of which 73.0% are \nblack and 27.0% is comprised of white and other ethnic groups. In the senior high schools, grades 9-\n12, 65,707 students are enrolled, of which 68.6% are black and 31.4% is comprised of white and \nother ethnic groups. (See Defendant Board of Education's Exhibit 6, page 4.)

This court previously found that the population of the City of Detroit peaked in 1950 and since that \nyear has been declining steadily at the rate of approximately 169,500 per decade. In 1950 Detroit's \npopulation constituted 61% of the total population of the standard metropolitan area; in 1970 it \ncomprised but 36% of that figure. The black population in the City of Detroit has increased markedly \nfrom 1.4% of the city population in 1900 to 43.9% in 1970. 338 F.Supp. 582 at 585-86. The Detroit \nBoard of Education's demographic expert testified, and we agree, that a current study of Detroit \npopulation trends indicates that as of 1975 the population of the City of Detroit is majority black. \n6. On September 27, 1971 this court found that the decline in the percentage of white students in the \nDetroit Public School system during the period 1961-1970 was greater than the percentage decline \nof the overall white population in the city. At the same time the percentage of black enrollment in the \nDetroit school system increased at a greater rate than the overall general black population in the city \nduring the same period. In the 1960-1961 school year there were 1107*1107 285,512 students in the \nDetroit school system, of which 130,765 (45.8%) were black. In the 1966-1967 school year there \nwere 297,035 students in the system, of which 168,299 (56.7%) were black. In the 1970-1971 school \nyear 289,743 students were enrolled, of which 184,194 (63.6%) were black. During the period \nbetween 1968 and 1970 the Detroit school system experienced a larger increase in the percentage \nof black students than any other major northern school district. The percentage increase in Detroit \nduring that period was 4.7% as contrasted with a high of 3.2% in Boston and a low of 1.1% in \nDenver among other major northern school districts. (338 F.Supp. 582 at 586.) This court predicted \nin 1971 that, if present trends continued, the percentage of black students in the Detroit Public \nSchools would be 72% in the 1975-1976 school year, 80.7% in the 1980-1981 school year and, \nfurther, the system would be virtually 100% black by 1992. (338 F.Supp. at 585.) The record \ncompiled during this remedial proceeding demonstrates that the predictions made by the District \nCourt in 1971 were totally accurate, if not somewhat conservative.[1] During the past five years the \nblack student enrollment has increased at an average of 2% per year, with a corresponding 2% \ndecrease in the white student population during the same five-year period. At the elementary level \nthe school system is presently 72.5% black and the trend toward a 2% annual increase has been \npositively identified. \n7. There are presently 326 schools in the Detroit Public School System: 226 elementary schools, 56 \njunior high schools, 22 high schools and 22 specialized and primary schools. The system operates \non a feeder plan, in which elementary students are assigned to specific junior and senior high \nschools. The geographic distribution of these schools, which are distributed throughout the city, \nreflects the Detroit School System's devotion to the neighborhood school concept. \nThe increasing black student enrollment in the Detroit Public Schools System, which is evident even \nin schools located at the city's boundaries, is demonstrated by the following tables reflecting \nsignificant increases in black student enrollment since 1969: \n                       TABLE I \n \n           RACIAL DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT 1969-1974 \n         OF SELECTED SCHOOLS — DETROIT EASTSIDE \n \n             PERCENTAGE BLACK ENROLLMENT \n\n                         Year \n                  1969   1970   1971   1972   1973   1974 \nSchool \n \nCARSTENS          37.4   48.0   62.3   73.2   82.6   88.3 \nGUYTON            17.2   30.6   49.5   64.1   73.9   77.9 \nHAMILTON          63.6   70.8   71.8   74.2   79.8   83.4 \nHOSMER             8.2   18.1   28.2   44.8   57.8   70.0 \nIVES               6.2   13.0   19.1   37.9   54.0   64.2 \nLINGEMANN         53.1   60.2   62.6   65.8   68.9   72.3 \nJACKSON J.

These tables clearly demonstrate the City of Detroit's changing demography and conclusively \nreflect significant increases in black student enrollment since 1969. The tables point out that schools \nthat were as low as 4.5% black in 1969 had increased to as much as 89.1% black by 1974. The \ndemographic patterns in Detroit reflect a large number of schools that are 70% or more black and it \nis apparent that many schools that are not yet majority black will become majority black within a \nshort period of time. For example, Table VII above contains a sampling of schools located on the \nnorthwest side of Detroit that will experience a majority black school population within the coming \nschool year. Similarly, schools located in the northeast section of Detroit that are presently 40-50% \nblack will be majority black within the coming school year. If present demographic trends continue, \nschools that now have student enrollment ranging between 20 and 40% black can expect to have \nsubstantial increases in black enrollment. Although the Detroit school system as a whole is \nexperiencing a 2% annual increase in black enrollment, the following table demonstrates that \nindividual schools in many areas undergoing racial demographic shifts have experienced increases \n\nin black enrollment that are as high as 16.9%. These shifting demographic patterns are rapidly \nchanging Detroit's residential patterns; mixed residential areas may now be found in all parts of the \ncity, including areas bordering the suburbs. \n        AVERAGE YEARLY PERCENTAGE \n     RACIAL CHANGE IN SELECTED SCHOOLS \n           BETWEEN 1969-1974 \n \n     PERCENTAGE BLACK ENROLLMENT \n \n                                    Average \n                                    Yearly \n                                  Percentage \n School       1969        1974      Change   \n \nEmerson        3.6        30.6        5.4 \nMarshall      57.3        84.6        5.5 \nKennedy       64.6        93.1        5.7 \nHerman        55.6        85.8        6.0 \nCooper        59.0        90.3        6.3 \nVan Zile      46.9        79.7        6.6 \nParker        62.7        97.6        7.0 \nMason         48.6        83.5        7.0 \nLynch         10.4        47.8        7.5 \nMcKenny        5.1        46.4        8.3 \nCoolidge       1.3        45.6        8.9 \nCerveny       51.5        97.5        9.2 \nWinship       50.1        97.7        9.5 \nCarstens      37.4        88.3       10.2 \nBow           13.6        68.6       11.0 \nFord          34.2        89.6       11.1 \nIves           6.2        64.2       11.6 \nHosmer         8.2        70.0       12.4 \nNewton        14.5        76.9       12.5 \nEdison         0.3        65.3       13.0 \nBurns         31.4        97.1       13.1 \nGuyton        17.2        77.9       12.1 \nParkman        7.8        78.3       14.1 \nDossin         6.0        80.8       15.0 \nCadillac      17.6        94.4       15.4 \nCrary          4.5        89.1       16.9 \n9. The Board began to undertake steps to desegregate as early as 1970 and 1112*1112 was \nprecluded from doing so only by the passage of Act 48 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1970 \n(Mich.Comp.Laws § 388.171) by the Michigan Legislature. The Board has followed the policy of \ntransporting students to relieve overcrowding in such a manner as to promote desegregation. In the \n1974-1975 school year the Detroit Board was able to increase the percentage of black students in \nmany schools that previously were nearly all-white. The table next annexed demonstrates the \ndramatic increases in black student enrollment at various schools accomplished by such \ntransportation: \n          PERCENTAGE BLACK ENROLLMENT \n         IN SCHOOLS RECEIVING STUDENTS \n                TO RELIEVE OVERCROWDING       \n \n\n                          1974 \n \n                              Without \nSchool                     Transportation   With Transportation \n \n  Northwest Area \n \n    Ann Arbor Trail[*]          2                 39 \n    Burgess                       4                 21 \n    Carver[*]                   0                 18 \n    Dow[*]                     32                 43 \n    Harding                      18                 22 \n    Healy[*]                    0                 18 \n    Houghten[*]                 4                 12 \n    Leslie                        0                 32 \n    Lodge[*]                    0                 27 \n    Mann                         14                 25 \n    Weatherby                     3                 16 \n    Yost[*]                     0                 42 \n \n  Northeast Area \n \n    Burbank[*]                  0                 16 \n    Hanstein[*]                 0                 23 \n    Marquette[*]                6                 12 \n    McGregor[*]                 0                 34 \n    Pulaski[*]                  2                 14 \n    Robinson                      9                  9 \n    Trix[*]                     0                 24 \n    Wilkins                       6                 16 \nC. Plaintiffs' Plan \n10. The plaintiffs' desegregation plan, submitted on April 1, 1975 pursuant to an order of this court \nand revised on April 30, 1975, was designed by Dr. Gordon Foster, Director of the University of \nMiami Title IV Desegregation Center. The plan as devised by Dr. Foster deals solely with pupil \nreassignment. The rationale and the ultimate goal of the plan are that, as far as possible, every \nschool within the district must reflect the racial ratio of the school district as a whole within the limits \nof 15 percentage points in either direction. Dr. Foster admitted that the 15% figure was arrived at \narbitrarily. Under Dr. Foster's definition any school whose racial composition varies more than 15% \nin either direction from the Detroit system-wide ratio is racially identifiable. Accordingly, an \nelementary school with 57.3%-87.3% black enrollment, a junior high school with 58.0%-88.0% black \nenrollment and a senior high school with 51.9%-81.9% black enrollment are desegregated schools. \nCarrying Dr. Foster's plan a step further, an elementary school that is 56% black is a racially \nidentifiable white school and an elementary school that is 85% black is a desegregated non-racially \nidentifiable school. (Plaintiffs' plan, page 7A.) \n11. In developing plaintiffs' plan, Dr. Foster testified he explored the extent to which desegregation \ncould be effected by each of the following commonly accepted techniques: redrawing zone lines \nbetween contiguous zones of differing racial composition, pairing schools within these zones, pairing \nnon-contiguous zones, changing feeder patterns in affected schools, examining various building \nutilization techniques, use of temporary space and changing grade structures in particular buildings. \nDr. Foster examined these alternatives in an effort to achieve his desired racial mix. Thereafter, he \nsubdivided the system into five clusters with similar racial compositions, each comprised of a group \n\nof high school constellations. (Plaintiffs' plan pages 3A, 4A.) Dr. Foster proceeded to alter the grade \nstructures at particular schools within each cluster and schools within the clusters were then paired. \nThe pairing of schools was accomplished by selection of all the \"racially identifiable\" white schools \nand the \"racially identifiable\" black schools in order of size and percentage of children by race. \nThereafter, children in the newly created pairings were exchanged to achieve ratios conforming to \nDr. Foster's definition of a desegregated school. The plan also created new feeder patterns \nfor 1113*1113 junior and senior high schools that ultimately achieve a racial mix falling within the \nsame parameters. \nPlaintiffs' pupil reassignment plan does not include kindergarten and pre-kindergarten children; \nprovision has been made for them to attend the school nearest their home, which in many instances \nnecessitates changes in facility utilization. Under the plaintiffs' plan present high school juniors, \nalthough included in the pupil assignment process, are given the option of remaining at their present \nschool and graduating there, assuming that to do so would not cause or maintain segregation. \n(Plaintiffs' plan page 5A.) \n12. Under the plaintiffs' plan, not only are many students reassigned to elementary schools outside \nof their neighborhood for half of their elementary years but, as a result of the pairings and changes in \nfeeder patterns into junior and senior high schools, many students will attend a school out of their \nhome neighborhood for between eight and eleven years. See, e. g., plaintiffs' plan for Webster, \nBirney, Peck, Amos, Beard, Larned, Higginbotham, Glazier and McGregor schools. Under plaintiffs' \nplan only the racial ratio that could be achieved by a particular pairing was considered in the \nselection of schools for the pairings. Consequently, the plaintiffs' plan creates many problems \nrelating to building capacity. For example, proposed enrollment exceeds school capacity at 18 junior \nhigh schools.[2] In addition, some elementary school pairings under the plan would result in over-\nenrollment. While plaintiffs' plan attempts to minimize problems of capacity by creating \"swing \ngrades\" with the variable assignments of the 6th, 7th and 9th grades, this technique results in undue \ndisruption of grade structures. At the senior high school level, the plaintiffs' plan has avoided \nproblems of capacity by assuming a dropout correction factor of .7069 for blacks and .9426 for \nwhites and others. (Plaintiffs' plan, page 6A.) As a result, there would be 13,865 fewer blacks and \n1,145 fewer whites in the three senior high grades than in the three junior high grades. However, no \nevidence was presented that justifies reliance upon such a dropout factor; consequently, capacity \nproblems may be created by plaintiffs' plan at the senior high school level as well. Reliance upon a \n30% dropout rate for black students at the senior high school level would disrupt the entire school \nsystem if the projected number of dropouts did not materialize. Moreover, even if such a statistic \nwere supported by credible evidence, plaintiffs have not allowed for the possibility that the dropout \nrate would decline in a desegregated system. \n13. We find that a large number of schools are paired solely to achieve a desired racial ratio in each \nof the paired schools. (Tr. Vol. 18, p. 45.) The arbitrary pairings devised in plaintiffs' plan necessitate \nthe transportation of thousands of black school children many miles to schools that still remain 80% \nor more black. The following table demonstrates that various schools were included in plaintiffs' plan \ndespite the fact that only insignificant changes occurred in their racial composition: \nPlan \nPage        SCHOOL          1974     PROPOSED \n \n  1    McCulloch            99.7       89.8 \n 14    Ilene                99.5       89.2 \n 14    King                 99.2       88.9 \n 29    Duffield             99.2       88.4 \n  8    Columbian            99.6       88.2 \n  8    Columbian Primary   100.0       87.3 \n\n 27    Bell                 99.7       87.3 \n 25    Marxhausen Primary   98.8       86.8 \n 12    Ruthruff             99.2       86.5 \n  5    Angel Primary        98.8       86.4 \n  1    Joffe Primary       100.0       86.3 \n  2    Sampson              99.7       86.1 \n 27    Berry                99.8       85.8 \n 13    Guest Primary        97.5       85.7 \n 11    Noble                98.8       85.5 \n 12    Herman               85.8       85.4 \n 25    Campbell            100.0       85.3 \n 30    Bunche              100.0       85.0 \n 11    Sherrill             99.9       84.7 \n  9    Parker               97.6       84.6 \n 11    Courtis              99.6       84.6 \n 24    Marshall             84.6       84.4 \n 11    Barton              100.0       84.2 \n 32    Tendler              95.3       83.6 \n 30    Lingemann            72.3       83.4 \n1114*1114 \nPlan \nPage        SCHOOL          1974     PROPOSED \n \n  8    Ellis                83.8       83.0 \n 15    Higginbotham        100.0       82.7 \n 27    Keith Primary        99.6       82.6 \n 30    Bellevue             96.7       82.1 \n 28    Krolik              100.0       81.8 \n 12    Alger               100.0       81.6 \n 11    McFarlane            96.5       81.4 \n 13    Cadillac             94.4       81.0 \n  1    Woodward             99.9       81.0 \n  4    Chaney               98.3       80.7 \n  1    Roosevelt            99.9       80.7 \n  9    Monnier              97.0       80.4 \n  4    Goldberg             98.9       80.4 \n 14    Dossin               80.8       80.8 \n  2    Turner               99.4       80.1 \n  4    Owen                 79.5       80.0 \nIt is apparent that, for example, plaintiffs' selection of the Lingemann School was made solely \nbecause white students were needed for transfer to the Bunche School to accomplish plaintiffs' \ndesired balance. Presently, the Lingemann School is 72.3% black and thus is a desegregated school \nby plaintiffs' definition. After application of plaintiffs' plan Lingemann School becomes 83.4% black. \nLingemann was included in plaintiffs' plan irrespective of the fact that it is located in a naturally \nintegrated neighborhood that has attained a measure of racial stability. The plaintiffs' plan groups the \nCraft, Ellis, Glazier and McKinstry Schools and transports 753 students; as a result, the Ellis School \nis reduced from 83.8% to 83.0% black. In the Carrie, Morley and Peck School grouping, the Carrie \nSchool is presently 58% black and thus not racially identifiable according to plaintiffs' definition. After \ntransporting children, Carrie is reduced to 54.1% black; black students are bussed out of Carrie \nsolely to be added to the black population at Morley. \nIn addition, after transporting thousands of students, there are a number of schools that are under or \nbarely exceed the acceptable minimum percentage of black enrollment set by Dr. Foster. The \nfollowing table demonstrates the racial mix achieved at selected schools: \n\nPlan \nPage              SCHOOL            % Black \n \n  5             Amos                  50.7 \n 10             Carver                52.0 \n 21             Richard               52.4 \n 16             Cooke                 52.5 \n 13             Houghton              53.4 \n  6             Higgins               54.1 \n  7             Cary                  54.1 \n 22             Trix                  54.9 \n 31             Burbank               55.1 \n 31             McGregor              55.4 \n  6             Bennett               55.8 \n  1             Webster               56.1 \n 17             Larned                56.1 \n 19             Burt                  57.1 \n 13             Yost                  57.4 \n 23             Grayling              57.4 \n  6             Harms                 57.6 \n 20             Law                   58.1 \n 10             McColl                58.5 \n 10             Maybee                58.5 \n 23             Greenfield Union      58.6 \n  9             Everett               58.6 \n 23             White                 56.3 \n 27             Clark                 59.0 \n  3             Burton                59.4 \n 19             Holcomb               59.4 \n 22             Fleming               59.5 \n 13             Edison                59.9 \n  3             Beard                 60.0 \nGroupings of schools with comparable racial ratios remain even after the application of Plaintiffs' \nplan. Schools containing enrollment over 80% black are grouped in a contiguous area and follow a \nconsistent pattern. Similarly, schools with enrollment under 60% black are grouped in contiguous \nareas and follow an easily discernible pattern. (See Defendant Board of Education's Exhibit 10.) \n14. The plaintiffs' reassignment plan requires the transportation of 77,303 children, of which 48,312 \nare elementary school children and 28,991 are junior high school children. Deducting 5,954 children \npresently being transported, plaintiffs have arrived at a total of 71,349 students requiring \ntransportation under their plan as proposed.[3] Thereafter, plaintiffs use a factor of four daily round \ntrips per bus with 66 pupils per bus and estimate that 271 additional busses would be required to \neffectuate their reassignment plan. (Plaintiffs' plan p. 7A.) There is no credible \nevidence 1115*1115 to support plaintiffs' assumption that every bus could be utilized to make four \nround trip runs. The plaintiffs' estimate of 271 buses is further dependent upon the unrealistic \nassumption of utilizing one pick-up point for 66 school children without consideration of the distances \nstudents would have to walk to arrive at the pick-up point. Moreover, their estimate does not \nconsider the ethnic composition of any area surrounding a pick-up point. \nPlaintiffs' present estimate of 77,303 students is not far below their 1972 estimate of 82,000 children \nrequiring transportation. The most credible estimate of the number of buses required for plaintiffs' \n1972 plan was 900. Expert testimony given in 1972 estimated that a school district could transport \nan average of 100 students for each bus in service. (Witness Kuthy, Tr. pages 122-124, book 2; \n\nMarch 15, 1972.) Based upon this testimony, which was not challenged by plaintiffs, plaintiffs' plan \nwould require the procurement of approximately 840 buses, including sufficient spares. \nAccordingly, we find that the plaintiffs' plan involves the transportation of thousands of students, the \ngreat majority of whom would be transported from one predominantly black school to another \npredominantly black school, involves bus runs within the city of Detroit of up to thirty-eight minutes \nwithout taking account of time for loading and unloading and would result in many children spending \nbetween nine and eleven years in schools as far as five to twelve miles from their neighborhood. \n15. The plaintiffs' plan, based upon a definition of racial identifiability as beyond a range of 15% from \nthe system-wide racial mix, is rigidly structured. The plan does not consider the past or present \ndemography of the Detroit school district, more particularly ignoring population shifts that have been \noccurring over the past decade. Moreover, the plan does not consider the possibility of \nresegregation in the City of Detroit. Although Dr. Foster testified that his plan purports to avoid the \npossibility of resegregation, this testimony is premised upon the assumption that after application of \nthe plan there would be \"no pockets where people can go.\" (Tr.Vol. 19, page 166.) There is no \ncredible evidence in this record to justify the assumption that adoption of plaintiffs' plan would lessen \nthe chance of resegregation within or without the city; Dr. Foster's testimony fails to take account of \nthe developed suburban areas that circumscribe the city. Accordingly we find that the plaintiffs' plan \ndoes not include provisions for promoting racial stability and avoiding resegregation. We re-affirm \nthe prior finding of this court that: \n\"It would be a natural, forseeable and probable consequence of the implementation of the Plaintiffs' \nplan that the trend of the Detroit schools towards a higher percentage of black students and a lower \npercentage of white students will be sharply accelerated.\" (Tr. March 14, 1972, pages 584-586.) \nD. Detroit Board of Education Plan \n16. The Detroit Board of Education submitted a plan that provided for transportation of approximately \n51,000 students. Interwoven into the Board's plan is the provision for magnet schools at both the \nmiddle school and senior high school levels to aid in attaining maximum desegregation. The goals of \nthe Board's plan include establishing maximum effective desegregation, removing racially identifiable \nwhite schools and promoting interracial understanding and respect in a diversified school district. \nThe Detroit Board plan takes into consideration the demography of the Detroit School District and \nrecognizes that the Detroit School System is now 71.5% black system-wide (72.3% black at the \nelementary school level). The Board plan acknowledges that since 1969, the school district \npopulation has declined from 293,859 to 257,396, which represents a loss of 36,463 students or a \n12% 1116*1116 decline. During this five-year period, the black school population has increased by \n3500 students and over 40,000 white students have left the system. Accordingly, only 67,833 white \nstudents are presently enrolled in the Detroit School System as compared with 189,563 black \nstudents. \nUnder the Board plan, the Detroit School System continues to operate on a feeder pattern. The \npairings have been devised to provide that every child will spend at least a portion of his education in \neither a neighborhood elementary school or a neighborhood junior and senior high school. Although \nregional lines are crossed in a few instances the plan generally respects regional boundary lines, \nwhich were brought about by the State's attempt to decentralize the school system. \n17. Like the plaintiffs' plan, the Board plan explores each of the commonly accepted techniques for \ndesegregation. Like the plaintiffs' plan, the Board plan revamps grade structures at the elementary \nlevel by providing that some will accommodate K through 3 and others K plus 4 through 6 and \nthereafter pairs various schools, providing transportation between the schools so paired. Through \n\nthis process of pairing and clustering schools, the Board plan attempts to eliminate racially \nidentifiable white elementary schools in Regions 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. The reassignment plan \ndesegregates the junior and senior high schools by changing the feeder patterns into the junior and \nsenior high schools, but at the same time the plan attempts to respect the concept of high school \nconstellations made up of neighborhood elementary schools and neighborhood junior high schools \nfeeding into an area high school. Under the feeder plan realignment the senior high schools will be \ndesegregated by September, 1976. Eight senior high schools will remain unaffected by the plan. \nThe Board plan attempts to achieve a 40%-60% black racial mix in the presently white identifiable \nschools. Although the Board purports not to strive for fixed racial quotas, we find that it in fact does \nso. In developing its plan the Board sought to determine the racial ratio that provided maximum \ndesegregation while preserving racial stability. The Board concluded that a racial mixture between \n40% and 60% black provided a healthy and stable racial mix. The Board's statistical data \ndemonstrates that where elementary schools in a high school constellation range from 75% to 95% \nblack, the high school generally is 95% to 100% black: White students simply leave the system by \nthe time they reach high school. Similarly, the statistical data establish that a racial mixture that does \nnot exceed 60% black provides a degree of stability. Some of the pairings selected by the Board \nplan, particularly in Region 2, fall below the goal set by the Board only because of the high \npercentage of Spanish-speaking students in these schools, which ranges as high as 20% in some \ninstances. To accommodate this factor the Board permitted the percentage of black students to fall \nbelow their target for racial mix. \n18. The Detroit Board's pupil reassignment plan does not affect the schools in Regions 1, 5 and 8; \neach of these three regions will remain over 90% black. The basic premise of the defendant Board's \nplan is to eliminate all of the schools with black enrollment below 25% and bring them to the level of \n40-60% black. These schools are located largely on the outer fringes of the city. The plan leaves \nuntouched 95 schools, most of which are between 95-100% black and are located within the inner \ncity.[4] Under the defendant Board's plan many 1117*1117 schools will operate over capacity, while \nsome schools in the inner city will have substantial capacity available. The Board decided to leave \n95 schools untouched principally because the Board found it impractical to desegregate the student \nbodies of these schools \"without undue hardship of long distance travel.\" The Board's plan \nacknowledges that there are too many black students in the system to provide all of them with a \ndesegregated experience while at the same time maintaining stability. \n19. The pupil transportation portion of the Detroit Board plan anticipates the daily transportation of \napproximately 51,000 children between paired schools. The evidence suggests the need for a fleet \nof busses ranging between 335 and 425 66-passenger vehicles. The defendant Board has \nsuggested that each bus would make two or three runs per day. (Defendant Board's Exhibit 28.) \nHowever, as indicated above with respect to the plaintiffs' plan, credible evidence has not been \npresented by either party to aid the court in making an accurate determination of the number of \nbusses needed to transport this vast number of children. The Detroit Board lacks the experience \nneeded to manage a transportation fleet and does not have available the appropriate data needed to \ndevise an efficient transportation system. This court found it necessary to instruct the Detroit Board \nto produce a sufficient data base to permit a computer print-out of a grid showing the exact racial \ncomposition of the student population in any particular area. Such data are necessary to develop an \nefficient transportation scheme. Moreover, when such data are available there will be no justification \nfor transporting children into an area without consideration of the ethnic composition of that area. \nTransportation under the defendant Board's plan involves much shorter distances than the plaintiffs' \nplan. School pairings were made to allow transportation routes along major thoroughfares. \n\n20. In addition to reassigning pupils between paired schools the Detroit Board's plan includes a \nprovision to continue certain magnet schools. Pursuant to an order of this court on December 3, \n1970, each of the eight regions created a magnet school, relying upon voluntary attendance. \nAlthough these magnet schools did not reach the racial mix sought by either the plaintiffs or the \ndefendant Board, they did serve to provide some degree of desegregation. \nThe Board plan also provides for the creation of four vocational high schools, specializing in medical \nscience, transportation, construction and the commercial arts. These four vocational schools will \noperate under an enrollment controlled to simulate the system-wide racial composition. In addition, \nthe Board's plan creates two technical high schools with enrollment open to students throughout the \nentire school system and creates city-wide high schools with specialized curricula. The enrollment of \nthese schools will be controlled to conform to the system-wide racial ratio. The vocational, technical \nand city-wide schools are designed as magnet schools to attract students from throughout the \nschool system as a means of further desegregating the school system. \nThe Board plan further suggests that four co-curricular programs be implemented on a city-wide \nbasis in order to provide additional children with a desegregated school experience. These programs \nwould include music education, art, physical education and athletics. (Board plan page 30.) \nFinally, the Board plan suggests the creation of cultural junior high school consortia designed to \nprovide students from substantially black majority schools with an opportunity to spend part of their \nacademic week with white students from other schools in various cultural centers in the greater \nDetroit area. The Board proposes that these classes be held at the Art Institute, the Detroit Public \nLibrary, the Merrill Palmer Institute, 1118*1118 Wayne State University, Shaw College and Lewis \nBusiness School. \nE. Educational Components \n21. In addition to the vocational and career education and the junior high consortium the plan \nsubmitted by the Detroit Board includes the following educational components: \na. In-Service Training \nb. Guidance and Counselling \nc. School-Community Relations \nd. Parental Involvement \ne. Student Rights and Responsibilities \nf. Testing \ng. Accountability \nh. Curriculum Design \ni. Bilingual Education \nj. Multi-Ethnic Curriculum \nk. Co-curricular Activities \nThe plan as submitted by the Detroit Board does not distinguish between those components that are \nnecessary to the successful implementation of a desegregation plan and those that are not. \nMoreover, the defendant Board's plan does not inform the court of the extent to which any of these \ncomponents may currently be in effect in the Detroit public school system; nor did the Board, either \nthrough its plan or through expert witnesses, provide the court with information adequate to permit \nthe court to evaluate the budgetary requests made for each of the components. Accordingly, the \ncourt found it necessary to obtain a report from Dr. Louis Monacel outlining the extent to which any \nor all of these components currently exist in the Detroit School System. (See \"Comparison of \n\nExisting Personnel, Programs, and Activities with the Personnel, Programs and Activities Required \nin the Detroit Public Schools Desegregation Plan.\") The court also found it necessary to seek an \nevaluation of each of these components from Dr. Michael Stolee, one of the plaintiffs' expert \nwitnesses. Finally, the court found it necessary to obtain additional information from its court-\nappointed experts to permit a proper evaluation of each of the components proposed in the Board \nplan. \n22. We find that the majority of the educational components included in the Detroit Board plan are \nessential for a school district undergoing desegregation. While it is true that the delivery of quality \ndesegregated educational services is the obligation of the school board, nevertheless this court \ndeems it essential to mandate educational components where they are needed to remedy effects of \npast segregation, to assure a successful desegregative effort and to minimize the possibility of \nresegregation. In a segregated setting many techniques deny equal protection to black students, \nsuch as discriminatory testing, discriminatory counseling and discriminatory application of student \ndiscipline. In a system undergoing desegregation, teachers will require orientation and training for \ndesegregation. Parents need to be more closely involved with the school system and properly \nstructured programs must be devised for improving the relationship between the school and the \ncommunity. We agree with the State Defendants[5] that the following components deserve special \nemphasis: (1) In-Service Training; (2) Guidance and Counselling; (3) Student Rights and \nResponsibilities (see this court's order, June 13, 1975); (4) School-Community Relations-Liaison; (5) \nParental Involvement; (6) Curriculum Design; (7) Multi-Ethnic Curriculum; and, (8) Co-curricular \nActivities. Additionally, we find that a testing program, vocational education and comprehensive \nreading programs are essential. We find that a comprehensive reading instruction program together \nwith appropriate remedial reading classes are essential to a successful desegregative effort. \nIntensified reading instruction is 1119*1119 basic to an educational system's obligation to every child \nin the school community (Tr. Vol. 19 pp. 40-41; Vol. 22, p. 47). Finally, the court finds that an \neffective court-oriented monitoring program is necessary for effective implementation of a \ndesegregation plan to assure that delivery of educational services will not be made in a \ndiscriminatory manner. \nF. School Financing \n23. The Detroit School District receives operating funds by levying a property tax, a portion of which \nis voted by the electors of the school district and a portion of which is allocated by the Wayne County \nTax Allocation Board from the 15 mills constitutionally authorized to be levied without a vote of the \nelectorate. The school district cannot levy additional millage without a favorable vote of the \nelectorate. The Detroit School District presently levies 22.51 mills for operating purposes and 2.25 \nmills to finance a prior $68 million deficit (pursuant to Public Acts 1 and 2 of 1973), a total of 24.76 \nmills. This tax effort produces approximately 38% of the school district's total budget. State aid \ncomprises 47% of the total budget. The State aid formula is based upon the number of students in \nthe school district and upon the State Equalized Valuation (SEV) of property in the district. Additional \nstate aid is provided by special grants in the form of entitlement and competitive funds. Federal \nfunds provide the remaining 15% of the budget. (Tr. Vol. 7, pp. 87-95; Vol. 25, pp. 106-107.) \n24. The State School Aid Act contains a formula designed to equalize revenues among school \ndistricts to the extent that disparities are the result of differences in SEV per pupil among districts. \nOver the preceding five-year period Detroit's State Equalized Valuation (SEV) has remained \nrelatively static while the SEV in the remainder of the state generally increased. This trend can be \nexplained by the movement of industry, commercial institutions and people to the suburbs and the \nhuge amounts of land used for expressways in Detroit, which remove the property from the city's tax \nrolls. \n\nBecause the per capita State Equalized Valuation in Detroit is 50% lower than the average for the 20 \nlargest cities in Michigan, the school district must levy additional millage to obtain a yield equal to \nthat of the other cities. (Tr. Vol. VII, p. 108, Defendant Board's Exhibit 31.) Because of legislation \ndirected specifically to the Detroit School District, it is required to operate on a balanced budget and \nmust file monthly reports with the State Auditor General. See Mich.Comp.Laws Sections 388.1238-\n1240. \n25. The total of all municipal taxes paid by Detroit citizens translates into a municipal millage \nequivalent of 84.83 mills. This is the highest tax burden in the state and is 55% higher than the state \naverage. Only 16 cities in the State of Michigan levy an income tax; among them, Detroit's rate is the \nhighest. However, Detroit's per capita income tax yield is substantially lower than the other 15 cities. \nMoreover, county taxes paid by Detroit citizens are 14.4% higher than the state average, and Detroit \nmunicipal taxes are 14.6% higher than the state average. \nDetroit taxpayers also have the highest municipal overburden in the state. (Defendant Board's \nExhibits 30, 33 & 41.) The State offers assistance to school districts whose municipal overburden (i. \ne. the total property tax rate in the district excluding the amount levied for school operating \npurposes) exceeds 125% of the state average (Bursley Act, Mich.Comp.Laws Section 338.1125). \nThe Act is designed to aid school districts throughout the state that are unable to raise sufficient tax \nrevenues because their taxpayers refuse to approve higher millage requests in the face of numerous \nother taxes imposed on the district by other local taxing authorities. (Tr. Vol. 7, pp. 103-104.) \nPresently, the municipal overburden section of 1120*1120 the Act is only approximately 28% funded \nby the Michigan Legislature. If the section were fully funded, the Detroit school district would receive \nan additional $61,682,000; if it were 50% funded during the 1974-75 school year, the school system \nwould have received an additional $18,787,000. (Tr. Vol. 7, pp. 116-120.) Thus, the State does not \nsupply the Detroit school district with as much money as the Act provides. \n26. The power equalizing section of the State School Aid Act guarantees that, subject to certain \nconditions, each school district will have available $975 per student. If local tax revenue is \ninsufficient to generate this amount, state aid will fund the balance. Complete funding of the balance, \nhowever, is contingent upon a local school district millage levy of 25 mills for operating purposes; \nwhere a school district levies a lesser amount, state aid is reduced proportionately. While 2.25 mills \nof Detroit's levy goes to debt retirement rather than operating purposes, the entire 24.76 mills is \ncounted in the formula for state aid. However, state aid does not provide operating revenue to \nreplace the 2.25 mills used for debt retirement. Thus, the 24.76 levy produces operating revenue of \nonly $916 per student in local taxes and state aid. (Tr. Vol. 7, pp. 93-107.) \nThe Wayne County Tax Allocation Board allocates .64 mills to the Detroit School District, which is \npassed on directly to the Detroit Library Commission. Since the majority of school districts in Wayne \nCounty receive 8.65 mills from the Tax Allocation Board and Detroit receives only 8.01 mills \nexclusive of the library allocation, this additional .64 mills should be counted in the State Aid \ncalculation; however, it is not. If it were, the district would have a total levy of 25.40 mills and thus \nwould be entitled to the maximum state aid guarantee under the power equalizing section of the Act. \nThe Detroit School District's millage levy of 24.76 mills is slightly below the state average of 26.15 \nmills. However, when this millage levy is added to all other taxes assessed against a Detroit \ntaxpayer, the tax burden is greatly in excess of the state average. (Tr. Vol. 7, p. 104; Vol. 24, p. 147.) \nThis burden has caused Detroit taxpayers to reject requests for additional millage. Seven of the ten \nmillage elections over the past eight years have failed. Of the three successful votes, one approved \nreplacing a 1% income tax that the School Board was authorized to levy pursuant to Public Acts 1 \nand 2 of 1973 with a 7 mill property tax; another merely renewed an already existing 7.5 mills for an \nadditional ten years. (Defendant Board's Exhibit 40; Tr. Vol. 24, pp. 143-144, 150-151; Vol. 7, p. \n\n140.) It can be reasonably expected that the already heavy burden upon Detroit taxpayers will cause \nthem to reject further requests for millage increases in the near future. \n27. The cost of education is a function of the size of the system and the Detroit School System, with \nan enrollment of 257,000 students, is the largest school district in the State of Michigan. Moreover, \nthe fact that Detroit's ranking for per pupil expenditure is above the state average is insignificant \nbecause per pupil educational costs are greater in urban areas. Additionally, the drop-out rate in the \nDetroit School District has been increasing over the past ten years; the reduction in enrollment \nresults in less State aid under the pupil membership formula of the State Aid Act at the same time \nthat the cost of delivering educational services is increasing. \n28. Prior to a 1971 legislative enactment, the Detroit School District did not receive any State \nreimbursement for in-city transportation expenditures, even though reimbursement was provided to \nrural and suburban school districts. (Tr. Vol. 24, pp. 103-105.) The Detroit School District first \nreceived an allocation for transportation in the 1973-74 school year, which was based on costs \nexpended during 1972-73. However, 1121*1121 unlike other districts, which were reimbursed for \n75% of their transportation expenditures, Detroit was reimbursed for only 92% of the 75% permitted \nunder the Act. Moreover, reimbursement for the Detroit School District was based upon the Wayne \nCounty average transportation costs of $47.00 per pupil, while the Detroit School District actually \nexpended $185.00 per pupil. Consequently, Detroit was reimbursed for only $288,770.39 of the \n$1,857,367 expended for transportation in 1972-73, and $469,981.15 of the $2,696,133 expended \nfor transportation in 1973-74. That Detroit's transportation costs are so high may be explained by \nseveral factors. First, transportation costs are necessarily greater in urban areas than in rural or \nsuburban areas. Second, because Detroit received no in-city transportation reimbursement \nwhatsoever prior to 1971, Detroit does not have its own bus system and is forced to rely on more \ncostly chartered buses to transport elementary and junior high school students. Third, Detroit is \nrequired to subsidize bus tickets for indigent high school students, which, in the long run, is also \nmore costly than operating a transportation system. (Tr. Vol. 24, pp. 107-123; Vol. 25, pp. 19-20.) \nG. Faculty Assignments \n29. The teacher population in the Detroit School District is 49.5% black. After having established \nconvincingly that fixed racial ratios for pupil reassignments destroy stability, the Detroit Board \ndesegregation plan suggests a scheme for teacher reassignments that achieves a 50-50 black-white \nracial mix in every school in the district. This approach is overly simplistic. It fails to take account of \nthe qualifications of a teacher to teach the subject and grade level, the necessity of balancing \nschools with respect to teacher experience and the necessity of considering the sex of the teacher, \nall of which are necessary ingredients for quality desegregated education. To seek a fixed racial mix, \nwithout more, is undesirable and arbitrary. \nWitnesses have acknowledged that the 50-50 racial quota for every school in the district was \ninserted in the Board's desegregation plan for the purpose of making the district eligible for \nEmergency School Aid Act (ESAA) funds. However, the parties did not produce credible evidence \nthat Federal funding was denied because of improper faculty distribution rather than because of \npoorly documented Board applications for such funding. Nor did the parties produce evidence of the \nFederal requirements for teacher assignments in a desegregated system. We note that 45 CFR \n185.44(d)(3) does not require a fixed racial quota for every school: \n\"(3) In the case of ineligibility resulting from discriminatory assignment of teachers as prohibited by \n185.43(b)(2), such applications for waiver shall contain evidence that such agency has assigned its \nfull-time classroom teachers to its schools so that no school is identified as intended for students of a \n\nparticular race, color, or national origin. Such non-discriminatory assignments shall, in the case of a \nlocal educational agency implementing a plan descripted in 195.11(a), conform to the requirements \nof such plan with respect to assignment of faculty. In the case of local educational agencies not \nimplementing such a plan, or implementing such a plan which contains no provision as to \nassignment of faculty, such assignments shall be made so that the proportion of minority group full-\ntime classroom teachers at each school is between 75 percentum and 125 percentum of the \nproportion of such minority group teachers which exist on the faculty as a whole.\" (Pending proposal \nper 40 Fed.Reg., No. 61 part III, 14173, March 28, 1975.) \nIt is apparent from the quoted regulation that a school district that has been 1122*1122 found guilty \nof segregation of staff and that is not yet subject to a court desegregation order may apply for a \nwaiver of disqualification by making assignments \"so that the proportion of minority group full-time \nclassroom teachers at each school is between 75 percentum and 125 percentum of the proportion of \nsuch minority group teachers which exist on the faculty as a whole.\" Thus, a school district with \napproximately 50% minority that has been found guilty of segregation of staff may qualify by \ndemonstrating teacher assignments that conform to 37.0% to 62.0% black. However, the Detroit \nSchool System has never been found guilty of de jure staff segregation. \nThe plan submitted by the plaintiffs does not contain any proposal dealing with faculty reassignment; \nplaintiffs concluded their critique of the faculty reassignment provision in the Detroit Board's plan by \nstating that they had no desire to resolve collective bargaining disputes unless and until they \ninterfered with constitutional rights of pupils. Notwithstanding this stated position, the only evidence \nproduced in this record concerning teacher reassignments was presented by the plaintiffs, who \nmade reference to Defendant Board Exhibit 6. This exhibit includes summaries of the identification \nof educational personnel by race. Educational personnel consists of more than just teaching staff; it \nalso includes principals, department heads, counselors, library personnel, audio-visual personnel, \nschool-community agents, etc. Thus, whatever correlations plaintiffs draw from this data is \nincompetent evidence of faculty segregation. \nThere is certainly insufficient evidence in this record to justify a finding that the ordinary \nadministrative and collective bargaining processes of the parties will not satisfy the necessity of \nhaving a proper racial mix among the teaching staff of the school district. Moreover, when this court's \ndesegregation order is implemented the necessity of additional teacher transfers on a desegregated \nbasis will become apparent. There is sufficient time for this court to obtain proper and adequate \nevidence to determine what orders will be essential to achieve a plan for complete desegregation of \npupils, faculty and staff. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. General Analysis of Both Plans. The plaintiffs' and defendant Board's desegregation plans employ \nthe same general techniques for desegregating the Detroit School System. Both plans pair and \ncluster schools, fracture grade structures and change feeder patterns of the affected schools. The \npairings involve the exchange of one-half of the student population from one school with one-half of \nthe student population of the other. Moreover, both plans provide for massive bussing.[6] Although \nemploying similar methods for desegregation, the parties differ as to what constitutes desegregation, \neach asserting that his plan is more \"feasible\", \"workable\", \"effective\" and \"realistic.\" These, of \ncourse, are proper criteria for testing an acceptable plan. Green v. County School Board,391 U.S. \n430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). \nPlaintiffs' approach to desegregation was devised by Dr. Gordon Foster, Director of the University of \nMiami Title IV Desegregation Center. Dr. Foster began by devising an arithmetical ratio for defining a \n\nracially identifiable school. Under his definition, any school that varies more than 15% in either \ndirection from the system-wide racial ratio is racially identifiable. Plaintiffs' plan thus accepts as \ndesegregated any elementary school that ranges between 57.3% and 87.3% black, any junior high \nschool that ranges between 1123*1123 58% and 88% black and any high school that ranges \nbetween 51.9% and 81.9% black. The plan divides the system into five clusters. Racially identifiable \nblack and white schools within each cluster are paired and one-half of the student body of each is \ntransported between the schools. To accommodate school reassignments, grade structures are \naltered at all schools. Additionally, all feeder patterns are changed to accomplish desegregation of \nthe junior and senior high schools. The plaintiffs' plan does not include any component other than \nstudent reassignment. \nUnlike the plaintiffs' plan, which proposes to bring every school in the district within 15 percentage \npoints of the system-wide racial mix, the goal of the Detroit Board's plan is to eliminate only the \nracially identifiable white schools, which are located largely in the outlying sections of the city. \nApproximately one-half of the district's 218 elementary schools will not be touched by the plan. The \nBoard has determined that a school that has 75% or more of one race is racially identifiable. The \nBoard's plan seeks to attain a 40% to 60% black enrollment in each school involved in the plan, \nalthough the presence of Spanish-speaking students, especially in Region Two, brings black \nenrollment below these percentages in some schools. \nThe Board's plan affects approximately 55% of the total student enrollment, or approximately \n141,554 students (State critique, p. 7) and requires transportation for 51,000 students over relatively \nshort distances. The plan gradually changes the racial ratios of the students in the junior and senior \nhigh schools by altering feeder patterns. The Board's plan generally respects regional boundary lines \nand does not affect three of the district's eight regions. \nAs an integral part of the pupil reassignment portion of its plan, the Board seeks to continue the \noperation of one magnet school in each region. The plan also creates a junior high school \nconsortium and co-curricular programs to achieve desegregation at this level. Moreover, the plan \nprovides for the establishment of four city-wide vocational high schools and two additional technical \nhigh schools that will have enrollments controlled to conform to the system-wide racial ratio. \nAdditionally, the Board's plan contains several educational components, which involve every school \nin the system. \nB. The Plaintiffs' Plan. Our first objection to plaintiffs' plan is that it is too rigidly structured. It controls \nthe entire educational life of a child. Not only does the plan reassign elementary children miles from \ntheir neighborhood schools, but because of new feeder patterns into junior and senior high schools \nmany students will attend schools many miles from their home for eight to eleven years of their \nschool life. Generally, courts have approached desegregation problems with flexibility, recognizing, \nas they must, that they are dealing with constitutional and equitable rights of children. Plaintiffs' plan \nwill not permit such flexibility. It does not take account of demographic trends or population \nproportions, black or white. As an inevitable consequence, most schools are 75-85% black. Once \nimplemented, it would identify the entire school district as black. \nThe plan's sole purpose is to achieve a racial mix within 15% of the system-wide ratio in every \nschool in the district. We reject plaintiffs' contentions that this is the only method that will \ndesegregate the Detroit School System, that their plan eliminates racially identifiable schools and \nthat their plan can be implemented immediately. While plaintiffs' plan increases the percentage of \nblacks in formerly racially identifiable white schools, this could be accomplished as well by a more \nflexible plan. Nor does plaintiffs' plan eliminate all racially identifiable schools; it is clear to us that a \nschool that is 85% black, although within plaintiffs' parameters, is a racially identifiable \n\nblack 1124*1124 school. Further, as will be demonstrated, there are serious obstacles to immediate \nimplementation of plaintiffs' plan. \nThe basic fallacy underlying plaintiffs' contentions, and the principal source of their plan's rigidity, lies \nin their definition of a desegregated school. While plaintiffs argue that any school within 15% of the \nsystem-wide racial mix is desegregated, the black-white population in the school system is so \ndisparate that these parameters range from 56.4% to 86.4% black. Clearly, it is unreasonable to \nconclude that, without examining anything more than the system-wide racial composition, a school \nthat is 55% black is a racially identifiable white school. Equally clearly, it is absurd to label a school \nthat is 85% black as \"desegregated\" merely because it falls within 15% of the system-wide racial \nmix. To do so renders the concept of racial identifiability meaningless. While the Supreme Court has \napproved the use of mathematical ratios in formulating school desegregation plans, it has approved \nthem only as \"a starting point in the process of shaping a remedy.\" Swann v. Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Moreover, the Court noted \nthat \"[t]he constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every \ncommunity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\" Swann v. \nBoard of Education, supra, at 24, 91 S.Ct. at 1280. \nFurther evidence of the rigidity of plaintiffs' plan is found in the fact that, even after transportation, \nmany schools are left 80% or more black. These schools are not scattered at random throughout the \nsystem but are clustered in the predominantly black center of the city. See defendant Board's Exhibit \n10. Another element of rigidity is the arbitrary selection of pairings in the plaintiffs' plan. Pairings \nwithin each cluster were made solely on the basis of the racial composition of the paired schools; in \nmaking the pairings, the plaintiffs did not consider the demography of the school district. \nConsequently, students are often bussed past a nearby 85-100% black school and are transported \nto another 85-100% black school further from their homes. To do so serves no useful purpose and \nmerely increases travel distances. After all this effort, plaintiffs' plan still leaves the majority of \nschools racially identifiably black. \nFinally, many pairings result in pupil assignments in excess of stated school capacity. For example, \nthe proposed enrollment of 18 junior high schools exceeds capacity. At the senior high level, the \nplaintiffs' plan avoids over-capacity only by assuming a correction factor for dropouts that projects \n13,865 fewer blacks in grades 10 through 12. There is no justification in this record for assuming \nsuch a dropout rate for blacks. Records are not available to reflect the race of dropouts, and \nmoreover during the 1973-1974 school year only 9,925 ninth through twelfth grade students dropped \nout of the system. Plaintiffs' plan further attempts to remedy the problem of over-capacity through the \nuse of the sixth, seventh and ninth grades as \"swing grades.\" Students in a \"swing grade\" could be \nreassigned to any school having capacity. However, there is insufficient justification in the record to \nconclude that use of \"swing grades\" will solve the problem of over-capacity. In any event, \"swing \ngrades\" create a greater burden upon the children involved and increase the amount of \ntransportation necessary to effect plaintiffs' plan. \nOur second objection to the plaintiffs' plan is that while it involves extensive bussing, it produces only \nnegligible desegregative results. Plaintiffs' plan itself is a positive pronouncement that the disparate \nblack-white ratio in this district precludes appreciable desegregation. After transporting 77,000 to \n81,000 students, plaintiffs' plan accomplishes only an insignificant reduction in the black population \nof the vast majority of 1125*1125 Detroit schools. If the white population were predominant, plaintiffs' \nplan could achieve desegregation. Under the practicalities at hand, however, plaintiffs' plan is \nunsatisfactory because it does not distinguish between bussing black students to majority black \nschools and majority white schools. As a consequence, it casts a heavy and unnecessary burden \nupon the black students, notwithstanding the fact that the remedy to be fashioned is to bestow upon \nthem benefits that were denied in the past. Black students are being asked to travel great distances \nto attend another conspicuously majority black school. The purpose of plaintiffs' plan is \n\nunexplainable to the children who are bussed many miles to a school with a racial composition not \nmuch different from the composition of their neighborhood school. Plaintiffs' plan could not find the \nacceptance in the black community necessary to the success of a desegregation plan. Moreover, the \ncost of the number of busses needed to effect plaintiffs' plan would financially cripple the Detroit \nSchool System, which has been operating on a survival budget for the past few years. Although the \nplaintiffs suggest that only 271 busses would be needed to implement their plan, we have concluded \nthat 840 busses is a more appropriate estimate. Further, the plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Detroit \nSchool System does not presently possess the expertise to manage, route, maintain and store such \na large fleet of busses. Although the Detroit School District has in the past bussed as many as \n14,400 students to relieve overcrowding, to accommodate dangerous crossings or to transport \nstudents excessive distances, such bussing has been accomplished haphazardly through the use of \nchartered city transportation. Moreover, the record disclosed that the Detroit School Board has not \nyet formulated bus routes to accommodate a transportation plan. It is no answer that testimony was \npresented to the effect that certain school system personnel could devise the routes in a relatively \nshort period of time; it is equally apparent from the record that their expertise to do so is \nquestionable. \nThe establishment of such a vast transportation network would bring chaos and financial destruction \nto the school system, with the main result of bussing black children to majority black schools. In the \nfinal analysis, plaintiffs' plan results largely in isolating minority students in concentrated minority \nschools, changing only the location of the school that each student attends. Moreover, the price for \nthis insignificant change is the severe burden of massive transportation. The Constitution does not \nrequire that such an extraordinary and costly remedy be applied where it produces only negligible \ndesegregative results. If such an extraordinary remedy as bussing is to be employed, it should be \nused to bus black children to white schools, not to schools that are predominantly black. The use of \nsuch a remedy in these circumstances contains all of the seeds for resegregation, which this court \nhas stated must be avoided at all costs. \nC. The Defendant Board of Education Plan. The Detroit Board of Education, unlike the boards in \nother school desegregation cases, is willing to assume its constitutional duty to desegregate the \nDetroit School System. The President of the Board and the members of the bi-racial administrative \nstaff have convinced the court they will willingly implement any desegregation order the court may \nissue.[7] Persuasive evidence of assured cooperation from the Board and General Superintendent \nlies in the fact that they have promptly complied with each and every order of this court. Pursuant to \nan order of the court, the Board timely submitted 1126*1126 a comprehensive desegregative plan; \nthey did not choose to rely upon a \"free choice\" plan or other methods that provide part-time \ndesegregation. In addition to many educational components and other desegregative devices, the \nplan includes massive bussing for permanent reassignment of students. Moreover, the attorney for \nthe Board has persistently assured the court that the Board would willingly implement any plan the \ncourt may order. The Board has vehemently argued that since the primary responsibility for bringing \nforth a constitutional desegregation plan rests in the hands of a local school board [Swann v. Board \nof Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Davis v. School District of City \nof Pontiac, Inc., 443 F.2d 573, 577 (6th Cir. 1971)], other plans should not be considered for \nimplementation by the court. We were persuaded, however, that a desegregation plan must be \nconsidered in light of all available alternatives. Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 439, 88 \nS.Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed.2d 716 (1968). \nNotwithstanding the Board's cooperative disposition, we perceive from the evidentiary hearing and \nfrom information furnished to the court both by the Community Relations Service and our own court-\nappointed experts that the plan adopted by the Board is a compromise taking into account many \ndivergent views. In January 1975, before this court's order to submit a desegregation plan, the Board \ncreated the \"Office of Desegregation\" to prepare a desegregation plan. This Office was staffed by \nmany people with divergent views. The vote to approve the final plan was 9 to 4, split along racial \n\nlines. Competing factions within the Board together with their followings have held widely differing \nviews on desegregation. Throughout the remedial hearing, there was excessive speculation \nconcerning what the court would mandate as constitutionally required for desegregation. \nAs a consequence, the plan as submitted was not well documented. The plan did not inform the \ncourt of the extent to which any of the programs suggested exist in the school district at the present \ntime. Nor did the plan present alternatives to the pairings and clusters suggested. Therefore, the \ncourt deemed it necessary to commission its experts to obtain information necessary to evaluate the \nsuggested educational components. The court further commissioned its experts to present additional \nalternatives to the transportation component contained in the plan in order to evaluate the \nconstitutionality of the plan as submitted by the Board. \nHaving considered the alternatives in light of all the \"practicalities\" at hand, we conclude that the \nBoard's goal of desegregating by eliminating racially identifiable white schools meets constitutional \nstandards for desegregating the Detroit School System. Moreover, we approve the Board's view that \nthe plan must include educational components allowing for further desegregation and assuring a \nsuccessful desegregative effort. However, the plan taken as a whole is not free from objection. While \ndisavowing any attempt to adhere to fixed racial ratios for each school, the Board's plan does just \nthat. The Board sought to determine the racial mix that provides the greatest degree of meaningful \ninteraction between the races while at the same time providing reliable assurances of stability. \nHaving established that schools in the 40-60% range have not been changed by demographic shifts, \nthe Board sought to impose this ratio (which is in reality 50%-50% plus or minus 10%) on all of the \nschools involved in its plan. \nRigid adherence to racial percentages is not only undesirable but constitutionally infirm. Racial \npercentages may be used as a starting point in formulating a remedy, but it is essential that all of the \ncritical circumstances apparent in a particular school district be afforded proper weight. Swann v. \nBoard of Education, supra. It would be simplistic to assume that the mere adherence to racial quotas \nis sufficient 1127*1127 to counter the pervasive effects of years of segregation. Because of inflexibile \nadherence to these percentages, some of the Board's school pairings are made without regard to \nthe facts at hand. For example, some of the Board's school pairings include schools that are located \nin bi-racial residential areas and have become desegregated naturally. To bus white or black \nchildren from these schools is to employ transportation solely to accommodate a racial count. Such \ntransportation serves no desegregative purpose and should be avoided by the Detroit Board. Where \na school already satisfies the definition of a desegregated school, it should not be included in a \ntransportation plan. \nThus, while we accept the Board's rationale of providing desegregation by eliminating the racially \nidentifiable white schools, we must reject the Board's plan itself because, like the plaintiffs' plan, it is \ntoo rigidly structured, seeking to obtain fixed quotas through massive bussing, and fails to take \naccount of the \"practicalities.\" Additionally, the Board's plan is objectionable in that it fails to consider \ntechniques for changing the racial compositions of schools that do not involve transportation. \nBorderline schools are paired in the Board's plan even where re-zoning across regional lines might \nsuffice to produce desegregation without transportation. Re-zoning is preferable to bussing because \nit reduces transportation, permits walk-in schools and serves bi-racial neighborhoods. Rather than \npair schools and transport students, the Board should first exhaust the possibility of restructuring \nattendance zones. Where capacity permits, one-way bussing might also reduce the amount of \ntransportation needed to desegregate. \nThe Board's plan is further objectionable in that it needlessly changes the grade structures of \nschools involved in the plan. It seems to us that traditional grade structures such as K-5, 6-8 and 9-\n\n12, which are preferable because irregular grade structures hamper school curriculum offerings, can \nbe achieved. \nMoreover, we are not convinced that the choice of schools involved in the pairings was not \ninfluenced by political considerations unrelated to the effect of the individual pairing on \ndesegregation. In order to detail our concern, we must take account of the structure of the Detroit \nSchool System. The decentralized system was conceived to afford an opportunity for the community \nto exercise greater control over its school system; however, decentralization as practiced in Detroit \nhas not truly accomplished this goal. \nPursuant to Act 48 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1970 (Mich.Comp.Laws 388.171 et seq.), the \nDetroit School System is divided into eight regions, each of which is permitted a vast amount of \nautonomy. Each region has its own board of education selected by the people within the region. The \nboard member receiving the most votes not only is elected chairman of the regional board but also is \na member of the central Board of Education. Thus, eight of the thirteen seats on the Central Board \nare occupied by regional chairmen. It is obvious that through political maneuvering, the eight \nregional chairmen can combine to promote regional interests at the expense of the over-all interests \nof the school system. Thus, desegregation could be hampered through the political maneuvering of \nthe regional board members combining to promote merely regional interests. Since the regional \nmembers constitute a majority of the Board, there is no way to ensure that the interests of the entire \nschool system can be advanced. \nWe are unable to perceive from the Act a legislative intent to create the structure that in fact \ndeveloped in the Detroit Schools. Rather than decentralizing to disperse bureaucratic authority, the \nDetroit Schools have developed another completely bureaucratized political institution: the regional \nboards of education. As originally conceived, the 1128*1128 legislature envisioned \"community \ncentered schools\", not separate independent bureaucracies substituting for a larger one. Moreover, \nthe present structure of the system frustrates the achievement of educational goals common to all \nschools throughout the system. The system is no longer a top-to-bottom command educational \norganization. What has impressed this court as a competent, dedicated staff at the top lacks the \nmeans of assuring that its orders and programs will be executed at the bottom. Any programs \ndesigned to advance the interests of the entire system can be frustrated by any one of the eight \nseparate regions. An edict from the top can be diluted so that by the time it reaches the lower level it \nhas little or no impact. \nMoreover, the testimony has indicated that the lines of demarcation between the central and regional \nboards have become obscured. The eight regional chairman acting in conjunction can effectively \nstrip the Central Board of all of its power. Thus, the Central Board appears to have been relegated to \nthe role of advise and consent, and it is apparent from the \"Guidelines for Decentralization\" \n(Defendant Board's Exhibit 4) that the Central Board must consent more frequently than it advises. \nThus, Detroit voters have been bequeathed no more than a vote for a regional board in exchange for \nthe Central Board. Nothing further toward achieving community control has developed in five years \nof decentralization. The political institution that has developed has cast a heavier financial burden \nupon the people of Detroit without resulting in a greater voice for the community in the operation of \nthe school system. Moreover, the structure has not been able to develop or hold public interest in the \nschools. Thus, the system now proposes to pay for the community relations and participation that \nthe legislature thought would be engendered by the Act itself. The legisture may wish to take a fresh \nlook at the structure that has developed in order to bring it more in line with the stated goals of \ndecentralization. \nIt is conceivable that the regions themselves might have made demands concerning the very \npairings contained in the plan; by soliciting the support of other regions, each region could effectively \n\nveto the inclusion of any given school in the plan. Evidence of such political accommodation might \nexist in some of the pairings chosen for the Board's plan. Some schools that fall within the Board's \nracial parameters are nevertheless paired to reduce their percentage of black students. For \nexample, Hanneman School is reduced from 58% to 48% black, Cary is reduced from 58% to 44% \nblack, McMillan is reduced from 52% to 41% black and Edison is reduced from 65% to 51% black. \nTransportation for the purpose of reducing the percentage of black students in already desegregated \nschools is clearly unnecessary and is inconsistent with the Board's avowed purpose of eliminating \nracially identifiable white schools. While the court cannot conclude that the inclusion of such schools \nin the Board's plan necessarily resulted from accommodation of regional interests for political \nmotives, neither can the court rule out such a possibility. \nThe Board's plan also includes a number of educational components intended to facilitate \ndesegregation. Some are unrelated to desegregation and have been inserted with the hope that they \ncould be implemented by court order. Moreover, the magnitude and the importance of some \ncomponents are overly exaggerated. In its entirety, the Board plan requires an expenditure of more \nthan $60 million. However, many of the proposed components have merit. Our remedy includes \nmany of the Board's suggested components and adds others that we feel are constitutionally \nmandated. \nD. Plaintiffs' Objections to the Board's Plan. The plaintiffs' principle complaint is that after application \nof the Detroit Board's plan, the racial composition of student enrollment in Regions 1129*1129 I, V \nand VIII, which comprise the inner core of the city, remains virtually unchanged at 90% to 95% black. \nPlaintiffs complain that the racial composition of student enrollment in 87 elementary schools, 18 \njunior high schools and 8 high schools in those three regions remains unchanged. Considering the \npracticalities at hand, we do not find that this objection presents any constitutional impediment to the \nBoard's plan. If the number of all-black or predominantly black schools that remain untouched \nappears to be large it must be remembered that the school district itself is large; it is the fifth largest \nin the country and contains a total of 326 schools spread over a 136 square mile area in which \nwhites are outnumbered by blacks. \nPlaintiffs refuse to acknowledge that the racial composition of these three regions precludes their \ninclusion in a desegregation plan. In Region V, for example, there are 31,354 students of whom \n(excluding the Spanish surnamed) only 989 (3.1%) are white. In Region VIII, there are 29,725 \nstudents of whom (excluding Spanish surnamed) only 1,329 (4.5%) are white. In Region I, there are \n24,907 students of whom (excluding Spanish surnamed) only 2,049 (8.2%) are white. Clearly, it \nwould be futile to attempt desegregation within the boundaries of these regions; thus, a \ndesegregation plan including these three regions would have to cross regional boundaries. But to \ninclude these regions in the Board's plan would bring about the same result that pertains after \napplication of the plaintiffs' own plan. The plaintiffs' plan itself is sufficient proof that any attempt to \ninclude these regions produces only negligible results. Application of plaintiffs' plan \"would make the \nDetroit school system more identifiably Black, and leave many of its schools 75 to 90 per cent \nBlack.\" (Findings of Fact — March 28, 1972, 484 F.2d 215, 243-44 (1973.))[8] \nThat inclusion of these three regions in a desegregation plan would produce only negligible \ndesegregative results is inevitable because even excluding Regions I, V and VIII there are only \n63,446 white students as compared to 103,007 black students. To attempt to disperse those white \nstudents throughout the eight regions, including the three overwhelmingly black regions, would \nproduce such negligible desegregative benefits that the extraordinary remedy of such cross-regional \nbussing would be unwarranted. To do so would only serve to lessen the little community control \nblacks now enjoy in those regions and, therefore, injure the very class the remedy is intended to \nbenefit. In the face of these \"practicalities\" there is no constitutional objection to leaving a number of \none-race or predominantly one-race schools. Swann v. Board of Education, supra; Quality Ed. for All \nChild., Inc. v. School Bd., etc. Ill., 385 F.Supp. 803, 823-24 (D.C.Ill.1974); Davis v. Board of School \n\nCommissioners of Mobile County, 430 F.2d 883 (5th Cir. 1970); Mannings v. Board of Pub. Instruc. \nof Hillsborough Co., Fla., 427 F.2d 874 (5th Cir., 1970). \nPlaintiffs next contend that the Board's decision to leave a number of one-race or predominantly \none-race schools in the inner-city regions and the Board's persistence in achieving a \"stable\" racial \nmix are based plainly and simply upon the Detroit Board's fear of \"white flight.\" They argue that the \nBoard's decision to allow certain untouched schools to operate under capacity while certain other \nschools included in the plan are over-utilized is based upon the fear that middle class white families \nwill flee the school district, the consideration of which is constitutionally impermissible. It is true that \n\"white flight\", like the degree of community resistance to a desegregation order, is not one of the \n\"practicalities\" to be considered in formulating a just, feasible 1130*1130 and workable plan. The law \nmust be obeyed notwithstanding these considerations. The Supreme Court has stated on several \noccasions that white flight is not justification for limiting the degree of desegregation; nor will it justify \na school board's refusal to desegregate. Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. \n2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972); United States v. Scotland Neck Bd. of Educ., 407 U.S. 484, 92 S. Ct. \n2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972). Our own and other circuits have similarly ruled. Higgins v. Board of \nEducation of City of Grand Rapids, 508 F.2d 779 (6th Cir. 1974); United States v. Board of Sch. \nCom'rs, Indianapolis, Ind., 503 F.2d 68 (7th Cir. 1974). To hold otherwise would be tantamount to \ndepriving school children of their constitutional rights in favor of those who prefer segregation. \nMoreover, consideration of white flight would be senseless in view of available statistical data \ncontained in the United States Census Bureau Statistics demonstrating that the exodus from the City \nof Detroit occurred in the decade preceding the filing of this litigation and has subsided since that \ndate.[9] In any event, the evidence presented does not support the conclusion that the Detroit Board \nwas responsive to the fear of white flight in the formulation of its desegregation plan. \nOn the other hand, it is unreasonable to expect the Central Board to administer a large school \nsystem in a vacuum. It is one thing to consider white flight to avoid or limit desegregation; it is quite \nanother thing to consider the practical problems with which a board of education is faced in \nattempting to achieve an acceptable racial balance without aggravating conditions that produce a \nself-defeating exodus of the middle class white and black. Higgins v. Board of Education of City of \nGrand Rapids, supra. Detroit's citizens are faced with a tax burden greater than any other city in the \nState of Michigan. The effects of the community over-burden in the district, caused by the degree of \ntaxing authority exercised by the City of Detroit, are not ameliorated to the full extent provided by law \nbecause the program is not fully funded by the State. The Board operates in a city that has left little \nroom for taxation to operate the school system. The community at large has already indicated its \nlack of support for propositions designed to increase the Board's millage by rejecting such proposals \nat the polls eight times. Not only is it constitutionally permissible to take these \"practicalities at hand\" \ninto account in forming a desegregation plan, but it would be irresponsible for this court not to \nconsider such practicalities where the very survival of an already bankrupt school system is at stake. \nTo act irresponsibly would deny all school children the right to quality education. \nThe Board was justified in considering the \"phenomenon of resegregation\" in devising its plan for \ndesegregation. Well-intentioned middle class blacks and whites will prefer private schools and \nsuburban schools to the prospect of remaining in a school district becoming incapable of delivering \nbasic educational services. A white and middle class black exodus will assuredly result if, as a result \nof desegregation orders, the school district became chaotic and hostile to intellectual achievement. It \nwas these \"practicalities\" that were considered by the Board in attempting to achieve a degree of \nracial stability, and we find that it is constitutionally permissible to take such practicalities into \naccount. As we have previously said, the plaintiffs' plan itself sufficiently demonstrates the \njustification for allowing one-race schools to operate in Detroit. 1131*1131The alternative is to make \neach and every school in the district identifiably black. \n\nFinally, plaintiffs have presented much evidence establishing that black children in segregated \nschools suffer adverse educational and psychological damage. This is a principle that has already \nbeen acknowledged by the courts, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 \nL.Ed. 873 (1954); 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955), and indeed this principle itself \njustifies the imposition of a desegregation order. However, the parties differ on the definition of \ndesegregation. We have demonstrated the fallacy underlying plaintiffs' definition. As a result of the \napplication of their plan, all of the schools throughout the district become racially identifiably black. \nThus, psychological damage is more likely to occur as a result of plaintiffs' plan than as a result of \nthe plan the court adopts. There are measures for assuring a perception that schools are \ndesegregated other than the presence of white students: equal facilities, integrated faculties and \nmeaningful guarantees that every student is welcome in any school notwithstanding race. \nOftentimes, as plaintiffs' plan demonstrates, the use of fixed quotas will not give assurances of \ndesegregation but instead may tend to extend segregation throughout the entire system. In a district \nwhere the racial percentages are as disparate as in this district, the existence of predominantly black \nschools is not demeaning to blacks. A plan that does no more than attempt to achieve the system-\nwide ratio in each and every school may result in transporting children merely to scatter a few white \nstudents here and there among the black students who are in the majority. To seek this result \nassumes that there is some divine grace in being white. The notion that the mere dispersing of \nwhites here and there is educationally beneficial to black students is demeaning. An appropriate \ndesegregation plan recognizes all the practicalities with which a particular school district is faced. A \ndesegregation plan must be based upon constitutional and equitable rights of individual students and \nupon the educational goals that desegregation seeks to attain. \nE. General Conclusions Pertaining to Both Plans. Many definitions of desegregation have been \nadvanced by courts, educators and social scientists. Some have said that not more than 90% may \nbe of any one race. Others hold that not more than 50% may be of any one minority group. Still \nothers insist on fixed racial quotas that reflect ethnic proportions prevailing in a given area such as a \nstate, county or local community. Some argue for precise ratios while others find that a specified \ntolerance, expressed as an arbitrary percentage that does not relate to racial compositions but rather \nis devised to accommodate an approach to planned desegregation, is necessary. If school \ndesegregation does not occur naturally through bi-racial neighborhoods, it must be planned. \nLimitations may be imposed by the desegregated area. For example, the black proportion of the \npopulation can be so great that racial balance will inevitably result in majority black schools. In such \nan area, only two alternatives are available: The desegregation area must be enlarged or flexibility \nmust be permitted in defining a desegregated setting. \nWhile there are many differences between the plans proposed by the plaintiffs and the defendant \nBoard, both plans share the common defect of relying on fixed racial percentages. Both plans \nattempt to conform the racial percentage of all of the schools included therein to a predetermined \nrange. We have indicated that the Constitution does not require such an inflexible approach to \ndesegregation. Both plans fail to take account of the practicalities at hand, such as demographic \ntrends, financial limitations, existing grade structures and naturally integrated neighborhoods. Both \nplans rely exclusively on transportation to reassign pupils without exploring alternative \ntechniques. 1132*1132 In the final analysis, it is because both plans are inattentive to such \npracticalities that both plans must be rejected. Because both plans ignore the \"practicalities,\" both \nplans require massive transportation that is, at least to some degree, unnecessary to achieve \ndesegration. \nPlaintiffs contend that there is only one Constitution, equally applicable to all school districts. Thus, \nthey argue that since we would not hesitate to apply theire parameters to a 72.5% white school \ndistrict, we should equally apply them to a 72.5% black school district. We think such an argument in \nthe context of this school district is superficial. The argument ignores the fact that the \"practicalities \nof the situation\", which the Constitution requires that we take into account, would be different if the \n\nschool district were 72.5% white. There would not be, for example, irresponsible bussing of black \nchildren to black identifiable schools. Thus, we are required to bear in mind that plaintiffs represent a \nclass of blacks, and that the bussing of black students to identifiably black schools places a burden \non the blacks, the very class whom the remedy is supposed to benefit, far in excess of the benefit \nresulting therefrom. Moreover, because plaintiffs represent a class of blacks and not a class of \nwhites, desegregation requires only that plaintiffs themselves be represented in significant \nproportions throughout the school district through the elimination of identifiably white schools. That a \nunitary school system in Detroit would not require the elimination of black identifiable schools as well \nis obvious from the plaintiffs' argument: If the system were 72.5% white, dispersing the blacks \nthroughout the entire system would not eliminate white identifiable schools. \nMoreover, that elimination of white identifiable schools is sufficient for desegregation in Detroit is \napparent from consideration of the evil desegregation is designed to correct. As plaintiffs have \nargued throughout this litigation, the evil of segregation lies in the devastating psychological impact \nupon black children of the knowledge that they are being excluded from white schools. \"To separate \nthem from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of \ninferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely \never to be undone.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. \n873 (1954). However, when blacks are represented in all schools throughout the system, i. e., when \nwhite identifiable schools are eliminated, this psychological effect no longer exists. There no longer \nis a denial of their right to equal protection when there are no schools from which they are excluded. \nWe have concluded that the rationale behind the Board's proposed plan promises meaningful \ndisestablishment of the state-imposed segregation. We perceive it to be our obligation to assess the \neffectiveness of the Board's plan in the light of the circumstances present and options available. \nAccordingly, the remedy we propose will set forth constitutional guidelines. Green v. County School \nBoard of New Kent County,391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). \nFrom the above, it is apparent that a fresh start is required to dismantle the remaining vestiges of a \ndual school system. We are prepared now to furnish the Board with guidelines solely devoted to this \npurpose and to assure quality education for all children in the system. \nV. REMEDIAL GUIDELINES \nThe remedial guidelines that we detail herein define constitutional requirements for dismantling the \ndual school system found to exist in Detroit. In fashioning these guidelines, we have carefully \nconsidered the \"practicalities of the situation\" existing in this district. The guidelines are \ncharacterized by the flexibility needed to accommodate conflicting 1133*1133 community concerns. \nWe have not, however, allowed flexibility to substitute for effectiveness, and it is our belief that these \nguidelines will achieve quality desegregated education for all children. \nRecognizing that the interest of the community as a whole is a legitimate concern of the district court \nin formulating a desegregation remedy, the Supreme Court has furnished the basic guideline: \n\"Having once found a violation, the district judge or school authorities should make every effort to \nachieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of \nthe situation.\" Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 37, 91 S. Ct. \n1289, 1292, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). \nBecause a desegregation plan is comparable to other equitable remedies, these guidelines are not \npremised upon a supposed inflexible constitutional standard that each school must have a \n\npredetermined racial composition. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). \nAccordingly, there may be variances in the racial mix between regions and between schools within a \nregion. The guidelines recognize that inflexible parameters are artificial and arbitrary and that their \napplication to the Detroit schools would disrupt and bankrupt the entire system. Thus, rather than \nfocus on each school in the system, the guidelines balance the practicalities that affect the system \nas a whole. Reflecting such practicalities, the guidelines recognize the impossibility of eliminating all \nracially identifiable black schools. \nFurther, consistent with general equitable principles, the guidelines balance the burden imposed \nagainst the desegregative results achieved. They recognize that transporting children is an \nextraordinary remedy to be employed only when appreciable results may be accomplished thereby, \nand then only when other alternatives have been exhausted. Therefore, our guidelines do not \nrequire transporting black children to predominantly black schools. Nor do they require transporting \nblack or white children from naturally desegregated attendance areas. The guidelines acknowledge \nthat the goal of desegregating this school system requires the elimination of racially identifiable white \nschools. Therefore, the guidelines require that a representative number of black students be \nassigned to every school in the district. However, taking account of the wide variance in racial \ncomposition existing throughout this school district, these guidelines do not attempt to eliminate \nracially identifiable white schools by imposing fixed ratios. We suggest a 50-50 racial mix only as a \nstarting point; we permit variations that take into account the desegregative results likely to be \nachieved. \nFurther, the guidelines recognize that, in a unitary school system, each school need not reflect the \nsystem-wide racial ratio. The guidelines consider criteria for measuring a unitary system other than \nratios, such as faculty assignments, staff assignments, extra-curricular activities, equality of facilities \nand assignment patterns. Moreover, the central theme of the guidelines is that equal educational \nopportunities must be available for all children. An equitable, workable and feasible plan must do \nmore than just reassign students. Thus, the guidelines provide for educational components designed \nboth to equalize the delivery of educational services at all schools and to restore quality education, \nwhich has deteriorated due to past acts of discrimination. Still other guidelines outline components \ndesigned to assure successful implementation of the court order by meeting head-on the special \nproblems accompanying desegregation. \nFrom these guidelines a plan should evolve that creates a unitary school system in which every \nschool in the community will be open to all students, 1134*1134 regardless of color. At the same \ntime, the guidelines do not neglect those considerations that would make it difficult for the system to \nmaintain the financial support of the community. Inherent in these guidelines is the recognition that a \ndesegregation case requires a search for a solution that is equitable and fair to all. Only in this way \ncan stability be assured and a sound educational system be preserved for the entire community. \n1. Guidelines for Revision of the Board Plan — \nStudent Transportation \nThe guidelines that follow will aid the Board in producing a plan that eliminates the remaining racially \nidentifiably white schools in the district by reassigning black students, who are in the majority, to \nschools throughout the city. It has been emphasized, however, that these guidelines do not sanction \nadherence to fixed racial ratios; they permit variation based on the constitutionally required \nconsideration of the \"practicalities of the situation.\" Davis v. School Commissioners of Mobile \nCounty, 402 U. S. 33, 37, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). The guidelines recognize that \n\nvariation in racial ratios is a function of many factors and does not necessarily diminish the degree of \ndesegregation. \nFrom these guidelines, a plan should evolve that effectively desegregates, brings into equitable \nbalance the objectives sought and the results to be achieved,[10] and exhausts all alternatives before \nsettling on the best method to achieve its results. Such guidelines follow: \n(a) Where possible, desegregation should be accomplished by re-zoning attendance areas in lieu of \ntransporting children.[11] Before using transportation, the Board must establish that all re-zoning \nmethods have been exhausted. The re-zoning should be attempted only after all the requirements of \nthe court's order are considered. The Board is reminded that when re-zoning efforts are attempted, \nregional lines need not be respected; when the choice is between preserving regional lines and \nbussing, regional lines must give way. Re-zoning will reduce the amount of transportation required to \ndesegregate and will permit the use of walk-in schools in integrated neighborhoods. \n(b) The revised transportation plan should avoid bussing black children to predominantly black \nschools. A school that is 55% or more black is a predominantly black school. Neither black nor white \nchildren should be bussed to schools that are already desegregated according to these guidelines; \ntransportation under such circumstances produces an inequitable burden upon the children affected. \nWhere only a small change in enrollment is needed to bring a school within the 30% to 55% range, \nthe use of satellite zones should be explored. We trust the Board is assembling the data base \nsuggested by the court to create computer print-outs showing the racial composition of \nneighborhoods by grids. When these data are compiled the Board will be able to avoid transportation \nunder the conditions described above. \nThe Detroit School System now transports 14,400 students by chartered bus to relieve overcrowding \nor to overcome dangerous crossings and long distances. Attempts should be made \nto 1135*1135 accommodate these children at neighborhood schools by re-zoning where the \nneighborhood school is an equal facility. However, if such transportation is necessary to \ndesegregate the receiving school, it should continue. In the event that it is essential to bus these \nstudents they should be transported to aid desegregation only in accordance with these guidelines. \n(c) Elementary schools should not be paired when one or both of the schools already satisfies the \ncourt's definition of a desegregated school.[12] Where desegregation cannot be accomplished by re-\nzoning or the use of satellite schools, the Board may pair appropriate schools. In making the pairings \nthe Board should, wherever possible, pair an identifiably white school with the nearest school \nexceeding 55% black enrollment. In this way, the distances involved in transportation will be kept to \na minimum. \n(d) The Board should seek to maintain uniform grade structures, consisting of K-5, 6-8 and 9-12. \nSince an excessive variety of grade structures makes it difficult to provide school offerings consistent \nwith quality education, consistent grade structures are preferable. Irregular grade structures would \nmake it difficult to incorporate the components contained in the court's order and would make the \nplan more difficult to monitor. \n(e) Desegregation and Integration Guide Translated Into Percentages and Racial Ratios.This \nguideline is derived from assessing the practicalities confronting the Detroit School System, such as \na rapidly increasing black student population and meager financial resources.[13] Schools with a \nresident population in the service area of between 30% and 55% black shall be considered \ndesegregated. If a school is within this range, no change in pupil assignment is necessary. Further \npupils need not be reassigned merely because a school's racial composition exceeds 55% black; the \n\"practicalities\" may dictate leaving the school alone. However, in no event should a school remain \nmore than 70% white. \n\n(f) Elementary Schools. Consistent with the foregoing, elementary schools should be desegregated \nby re-zoning if possible. An elementary school with a resident population in the service area of \nbetween 30-50% black has achieved a permissible degree of desegregation. In those schools where \na small change in enrollment will bring the school within these parameters, attempts should be made \nto do so by using a satellite zone. In selecting satellite zones, an appropriate group of children to \nselect would be a group residing in an elementary service area that includes a middle school to \nwhich the children can walk. Transporting a child for his elementary school career would be more \nequitable if the child could later walk to a middle school. Although it may be impossible to divide the \nburden involved in a desegregation plan equally, the Board must avoid gross inequities. Particularly, \nthere should not be great variations in the transportation burden falling on adjacent areas because \nsuch variations will influence residential patterns. The 1136*1136 Board should further avoid bussing \nchildren out of an integrated service area. \nSince K-5 grade structures will result in excessive school capacity, the Board can take antiquated \nschool buildings out of service. These closings and subsequent pupil reassignments are intended to \nequalize facilities and to further desegregation both by adjusting racial composition and by facilitating \na non-discriminatory construction program. The Board may also consider closing some schools \ntemporarily if further desegregation would result. \nElementary schools that cannot be desegregated by re-zoning or by satellite zones shall be paired. If \npossible, the grade structure at each paired school shall remain K-5 provided the paired schools \nhave approximately equal enrollments. Pairings need not be made one on one; for example, a 900-\npupil school can be paired with a 300 and 600-pupil school. If maintaining the grade structure K-5 is \nnot possible, the changing of grade structures will be permitted. Enrollments in schools can be \nadjusted by redrawing the service area zone lines. \nThe paired schools will be desegregated by exchanging pupils between the pairs. One-half of the \npupils in each grade from each school will be bussed to the school or schools in the pair. The \nclasses will be rotated annually or semiannually so that each child will attend his neighborhood \nschool at least every other year. Teachers also may be rotated so they can continue to teach the \nsame group of students. When the pairings are completed, students should enter integrated \nclassrooms. \n(g) Middle Schools. Middle schools will serve Grades 6-8. To provide for the maximum degree of \ndesegregation, there will be two types of middle schools: \"zoned middle schools\" and \"open \nenrollment middle schools.\" The open enrollment schools will function similarly to current magnet \nmiddle schools, but will have a controlled racial mix generally 55-70% black. The racial composition \nmay exceed these parameters where practicalities require, but in no event should a school exceed \n50% white. The zoned middle schools need not have zones that correspond to elementary service \nboundaries. In developing the zones, the Board shall provide walk-in schools wherever possible. \nAlthough a zoned middle school that is 30-55% black shall be considered desegregated, the Board's \ntarget should be 50% black enrollment at this level. In developing zones for middle schools, the \nBoard may consider satellite zones but such zones should be avoided where it can be shown that \nthey would create housing instability resulting from differing treatment of adjacent neighborhoods. \nGenerally, no child should be bussed for more than five of his first eight years. Any child that is \nbussed for desegregation at the elementary level for five years should not be bussed for \ndesegregation to a middle school. If the Board finds compliance with this guideline impossible, the \nBoard shall report the exceptions by numbers, race and location. \n(h) Summary. We believe these guidelines provide sufficient latitude to accommodate the \npracticalities needed to be considered to preserve a financially crippled school system. The \n\nsuggested parameters permit the Board to consider inevitable demographic trends and allow the \nformation of long-range plans to deliver quality education and maintain financial independence. (See \nchart following — Demographic Projections 1975-1980.) This kind of stability, which assures the \ndurability and longevity of court orders requiring desegregation now and hereafter, is constitutionally \ncompatible with the desegregative goals the Board must seek. \nMoreover, these parameters recognize an equitable constitutional balancing of private and public \nneeds. Students, particularly older students, must be able to perceive that the inconvenience of \nattending a less accessible 1137*1137 school serves a noble goal, that a desegregation plan will \nenhance the quality of education and that desegregation is neither disruptive nor destructive. \nIn sum, the plan will have the following characteristics: \n(a) Schools as presently constituted, either by resident enrollment, bussing to relieve overcrowding \nor bussing resulting from school closings, that result in a 30%-55% black enrollment shall be \nconsidered desegregated. \n1138*1138 (b) In providing further desegregation, a 50-50 enrollment may be used as a starting point \nfor reassigning students, but no school shall be less than 30% black. \n(c) Pairing shall involve only schools with enrollments under 30% or over 55% black. To minimize \ntravel distances, pairings shall be made between each white school and the nearest predominantly \nblack school. \n(d) As far as possible, the schools will maintain a uniform grade structure of K-5, 6-8 and 9-12. \n(e) Elementary schools will enroll children in grades K-5. Classrooms or half classrooms will be \nexchanged between the paired schools on a rotating basis, permitting each child to attend his home \nschool at least every other year. Not all elementary school children will attend paired schools; some \nwill reside in integrated neighborhoods and as many elementary schools as possible will be \ndesegregated by redesigning attendance zones. Where possible, satellite zones rather than two-way \nbussing will be used. Where bussing is needed, bus trips will be as short as possible. The change in \ngrade structure from K-6 to K-5 will generate excess elementary school facilities, enabling a number \nof antiquated schools to be taken out of service. \n(f) Middle schools, 6-8, will be of two types: \"open enrollment\" and \"zoned schools.\" In keeping with \nthese guidelines, open enrollment schools will have racially controlled enrollments. Where the \npracticalities permit, middle schools will be 55-70% black, and no middle school will enroll less than \n50% black. \n(g) The plan will involve the creation of vocational centers.[14] Two high schools may be converted \ninto vocational centers; students currently enrolled in these schools will be reassigned to other \nnearby schools, thus aiding desegregation. Although the vocational centers will be open to all \nstudents city-wide, their racial compositions will be controlled. Initially, no high school or vocational \ncenter shall enroll less than 40% minority. Thereafter, enrollments will be controlled to conform to \nthese guidelines. Curriculum studies will be necessary to adjust the present city-wide schools such \nas the Aero Mechanics High School. \n2. Reading and Communication Skills \n\nThe development of proficient reading skills is the most essential educational service a school \nsystem can deliver. Where a school lacks a successful reading program, a child cannot be assured \nacademic success or a beneficial school experience. Students who have not achieved adequate \nreading and communication skills cannot succeed in the main-stream of society. They are limited in \ntheir vocational selection; their handicap necessarily precludes them from entering the professional \nworld. While in school, they cannot be fairly tested. \nThere is no educational component more directly associated with the process of desegregation than \nreading. Statistical data establish that minority youngsters lag significantly behind their white \ncounterparts in reading skills, which in turn affects the ability of minority students to follow written \ninstructions, succeed on aptitude tests, pass entrance examinations for colleges and universities and \ncompete in the world of arts, sciences, occupations and skills. Moreover, when such conditions \npersist, there is a direct effect upon the school environment. Students become disciplinary problems \nwhen in reality their problem is directly associated with an inability to conceptualize due to a lack of \nproper reading and communication skills. As a consequence, teachers and staff assume that such \nminority students are uneducable, thus further deteriorating the school environment for these \nstudents. To eradicate the effects of past discrimination, a remedial reading \nprogram 1139*1139 should be instituted immediately to correct the deficiencies of those midway in \ntheir educational experience. \nThe court considers this component deserving of top priority in a school district undergoing \ndesegregation. Accordingly, the court's order will direct that the development of such a program in \nthe desegregative process be the direct responsibility of the General Superintendent and a \ncommittee to be selected by him.[15] We trust that such a committee will include some of the \nexpertise available in the Michigan community. Detroit is fortunate in having a number of people \nexpert in developing learning techniques for reading who are at the same time devoted to Detroit's \neducational system. This court hopes that the General Superintendent will personally pioneer this \neffort to achieve excellence unequaled by any other school system. \n3. In-Service Training \nA comprehensive in-service training program is essential to a system undergoing desegregation. A \nconversion to a unitary system cannot be successful absent an in-service training program for all \nteachers and staff. All participants in the desegregation process must be prepared to deal with new \nexperiences that inevitably arise. The order that follows pursuant to these guidelines requires in-\nservice training in such fields as teacher expectations, human relations, minority culture, testing, the \nstudent code of conduct and the administration of discipline in a desegregated system for all school \npersonnel. The program shall also include an explanation of the purpose and nature of each \ncomponent in the desegregation order. It is known that teachers' attitudes toward students are \naffected by desegregation. These attitudes play a critical part in the atmosphere of a school and \naffect the pulse of the school system. Teachers, both white and black, often have unhealthy \nexpectations of the ability and worth of students of the oposite race. Moreover, it is known that \nteachers' expectations vary with socio-economic variations among students. These expectations \nmust, through training, be re-oriented to ensure that academic achievement of black students in the \ndesegregation process is not impeded. A comprehensive in-service training program will ensure that \nall students are treated equally in the educational process. The goal of a sound in-service training \nprogram should be the awareness that there are neither black students nor white students, just \nstudents. \nThe Detroit Board of Education is advised that Wayne State University and other universities have \noffered their cooperation in this desegregation effort. Accordingly, the Board shall request the Wayne \nState University College of Education to assist in developing a comprehensive program to provide \n\nin-service training. The court is of the view that the program outlined in the Board plan will fulfill the \nexpectations of the court order. The Detroit Board is further directed to seek assistance and funding \nfrom the Title IV Center at the University of Michigan and, upon issuance of the court order, to \nsubmit further proposals for assistance to the United States Office Of Education for Emergency \nSchool Aid Act (ESAA) funds. Moreover, the defendant Superintendent of Public Instruction is \ndirected to seek financial and personnel assistance from other state institutions. The in-service \ntraining program as instituted should be on-going, include all schools in the system and be open to \nall personnel employed by the Detroit Board of Education. Such in-service training sessions shall be \nconducted during the school year and just prior to the opening of school. The Board should \ndiscontinue 1140*1140 payment to teachers for attendance at such sessions on Saturdays. \n4. Vocational Education — Technical High Schools \nOpen association with other students of varying races, cultures and religions forms the most basic \ningredient in a student's learning experience. Children living, learning and playing together convert a \nbuilding into a human institution with a pulse and personality. Students, parents and teachers come \ntogether to live, learn and work in an atmosphere imbued with human warmth. In this atmosphere, \nthe attachments born of a classroom become the most durable. A segregated system deprives \nstudents of this interpersonal learning experience and injures them in a lasting way. The resulting \nisolation destroys the atmosphere and pulse of a school system and, eventually, the quality of the \neducational services rendered. Minority students in segregated settings often lose interest in \neducation, eventually believing they have no stake in the system. This inevitable result is reflected \nboth in the school system's dropout rate and in the number of students who graduate without being \nable to read or spell. Thus, a segregated school system fails to provide relevant and diversified \nprograms to meet the needs of the students it serves. \nVocational education is given high priority in these guidelines because while it is able to compensate \nfor past discrimination, at the same time it serves as an effective tool for desegregation. It can both \noffer an immediate desegregated setting and help re-establish quality education. Vocational \neducation is easily assimilated into the Magnet Program now in effect in this system and offers \nattractions that exceed those currently available. It can serve to combat the dropout rate and prepare \nstudents for specific work situations in the business world. Finally, it will equip minority students with \nthe knowledge and skills essential to enter occupational trades often foreclosed to them. \nAccordingly, the court's order will require that the defendants Detroit Board and State Board of \nEducation create vocational centers devoted to in-depth occupational preparation in the construction \ntrades, transportation and health services. In addition, the order will require that the defendants \nDetroit Board and State Board of Education create two new technical high schools in which business \neducation will be the central part of the curriculum. It shall be the responsibility of the School Board \nand the State Board of Education to fulfill their obligations under the Constitution and state law to \nascertain that the four vocational centers created are of the highest quality. Moreover, each of these \nvocational centers shall include a grade 13 providing advanced offerings both for those students \npresently enrolled and for other students who have left the system within the past three years. \nAs an immediate desegregative effort, the Detroit Board of Education and the State Board of \nEducation are directed to create two such vocational centers as promptly as circumstances permit. \nIn order to eliminate the need for new construction, two existing facilities may be selected; the court's \nexperts suggested that Cooley and Kettering be utilized as vocational centers. Accordingly, the \nDetroit Board shall immediately submit a plan conforming to the following guidelines: \n\n(a) The plan shall indicate where students presently assigned to Cooley and Kettering will be \nreassigned and the effect of such reassignment upon desegregation. The plan should minimize the \ninconvenience to students who would otherwise enroll at these schools. The Board may wish to \nconsider the feasibility of not enrolling students at either Cooley or Kettering in the September, 1975 \nschool term. \n(b) The Board shall submit maps depicting the new high school zones that result from the elimination \nof the Cooley and Kettering attendance areas. \n1141*1141 (c) The plan shall contain detailed curricula for Cooley and Kettering High Schools. \n(d) The vocational centers at Cooley and Kettering shall be city-wide schools and shall have a racial \nmix that, considering the practicalities at hand, approaches a ratio of 60% black and 40% white. \n(e) The Detroit Board and the State Board should confer immediately and submit a plan to the court \nnot later than three weeks from the issuance of the court's order. The plan should include a time and \ncost schedule for modifications necessary to convert Cooley and Kettering High Schools into \nvocational centers and should also include proposals for two additional centers. The parties are \ndirected to ensure that these vocational centers are equal in quality to the best vocational schools in \nthe country. \nAs an immediate desegregative effort the Detroit Board shall, as promptly as circumstances permit, \nundertake to create two additional technical high schools, which are to be modeled after the program \nat Cass Technical High School. The Board shall select sites for such technical high schools that \nafford the maximum degree of desegregation. In keeping with this desegregative effort, the Detroit \nBoard of Education and the General Superintendent shall commission a study of the curricula to be \nestablished at the two technical high schools. The study should determine what duplications might \nexist between offerings at the technical high schools and the vocational centers or the academic \nhigh schools.[16] After formulation of the joint plan for creation of the vocational centers, the State \nBoard of Education shall submit such plan for review and evaluation to an appropriate evaluation \npanel such as a vocational education expert at an institution of higher learning. When the joint plan \nis submitted, it shall include the evaluation made by such expert and modifications suggested as a \nresult of such evaluation. \nUpon recommendation of the court-appointed experts, the order of the court will direct, as a further \ndesegregative effort, that the Detroit Board of Education undertake a study evaluating an alternate \nform of education following the Parkway Concept. The court's experts have suggested that Northern \nHigh School could be used for such a project. Accordingly, the defendant School Board is directed to \nsubmit plans for such a program, including an evaluation of its feasibility and the contribution that \nsuch a program might make to desegregation. The Board shall further seek and obtain a \nprofessional evaluation of such concept from outside the School Board's present administrative staff. \nIf the evaluation is favorable, the Board shall thereafter submit plans and costs schedules for \nimplementation of such concept. \nIt has been brought to the attention of the court that the Detroit School Board is presently ineligible \nfor full funding from the state to operate the proposed vocational education programs because \ncertain provisions of the contract between the Detroit School Board and the Detroit Federation of \nTeachers, which require that a school day not exceed 7¼ hours and impose a maximum of 25 \nteaching periods per week, conflict with regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education. \nThe court, however, has stated that vocational education programs must be instituted pursuant to a \ndesegregation mandate. Accordingly, the parties shall appear in court for a hearing and subsequent \norder that will set aside either the State 1142*1142 Board of Education regulations or the contractual \nprovisions. The date for the hearing shall be set upon motion to be filed by the Detroit Board of \nEducation. \n5. Testing \n\nOf great importance to a system undergoing desegregation is the assurance that tests administered \nto students are free from racial, ethnic and cultural bias. Black children are especially affected by \nbiased testing procedures. As a result of such procedures, they may find themselves segregated in \nclassrooms for slow learners, which will thereafter impede their educational growth. Moreover, the \ndiscriminatory use of test results can cause resegregation. \nThe Detroit Board and State Board of Education are constitutionally mandated to eliminate all \nvestiges of discrimination, including discrimination through improper testing. Thus, the Detroit Board \nand the State Board of Education must devise a program that will ensure that testing design, content \nand procedures are adaptable to a desegregated school system. The plan should include provisions \ndealing with staffing and costs involved. We have examined the Board's testing component carefully \nand have found it to be sufficiently comprehensive to serve as a model for such a testing program. \n6. Student Rights and Responsibilities \nBy previous orders this court has demonstrated the high priority that it places on student rights and \nresponsibilities, which the court has referred to as a Uniform Code of Conduct. We have also said \nthat children living, learning and playing together convert a building into a human institution with a \npulse and personality, and that when students, parents and teachers come together to live, learn \nand work the school develops an identifiable environment. It is this environment that the Detroit \nBoard is constitutionally bound to protect in order to assure that every student can enjoy the right to \na happy, healthy and rewarding school experience.[17] Moreover, we agree with the plaintiffs' \nassertion that \"[n]o violence whether against person or property, will be allowed to impede the \nimplementation of the desegregation process. Both students and teachers must feel secure in their \nperson and in their ability to perform their respective functions without fear of undue and \nunnecessary disruption.\" \nIt is the court's intention that from the commencement of the 1975-1976 school year the Board must \nnot tolerate violence in any school in the system. Moreover, the court order will require that the \nUniform Code of Conduct be administered uniformly without regard to regional lines. All regions will \nbe obliged to follow prescribed forms and uniform procedures, to be devised by the Central Board \nand approved by the court. The court will not, of course, attempt to substitute its judgment for the \ndiscretion of school administrative personnel in dealing with student violations of the Code. The court \nwill ensure, however, that all Detroit students are afforded minimal right of due process consistent \nwith Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). While the court is \nconcerned that violence and vandalism do not impede the desegregative process, the court is \nequally concerned that the rights of the students are fully protected. In a system undergoing \ndesegregation, black and white students will be subjected to teachers of both races who may apply \nthe Code in a discriminatory manner. Staff members must be made aware of the rights of due \nprocess set forth in the Code. Moreover, students must be advised not only of the conduct \nproscribed, but also of their right to due process when involved in disciplinary procedures. The Code \ntherefore, must simultaneously protect the students against arbitrary and discriminatory exclusions, \nsuspensions or expulsions and assure that disruptions in the school or classroom will be \ndealt 1143*1143 with in every instance. The court has recently received the Board's second draft of \nthe proposed Code. Since the court has not had an opportunity to study this draft, the Board will \nawait further directions from the court. \n7. School-Community Relations (Parental \nInvolvement) \n\nThe importance that the court places on this component is evident from the July 18, 1975 \ncommunication requiring the Detroit Board to submit a detailed plan for a community relations \nprogram, which the court has not yet had an opportunity to examine in detail. We agree with plaintiffs \nthat an acceptable community relations plan should include provisions for school-community liaison \nand parental involvement. The school-community relations program should give real meaning to the \ndecentralization anticipated by the Michigan Legislature and provide an effective vehicle for true \ncommunity involvement in all the schools. To achieve maximum community participation the \nprogram should depend upon parental support; participants should be selected voluntarily and serve \nwithout compensation. An effective community relations program must develop a partnership \nbetween the community and the schools and must cooperate with traditional groups such as parent-\nteacher organizations and local school advisory boards. There should be a cooperative flow of \ninformation from the school to the community and from the community to the school. Open and free \ndiscussion and participation in the desegregation process should be encouraged. The school-\ncommunity relations organization should receive complete encouragement, budgetary support, direct \nassistance and a free flow of information from school authorities. \nThe school-community relations component shall be a subject of a separate order of this court. The \nportion of the Board's plan that includes a monitoring provision in the suggested community-relations \ncomponent is rejected. \n8. Counseling and Career Guidance \nSchool districts undergoing desegregation inevitably place psychological pressures upon the \nstudents affected. Counselors are essential to provide solutions to the many problems that result \nfrom such pressures. Moreover, the success of the vocational and technical schools created herein \ndepends upon the efforts of counselors whose guidance is essential to students seeking a career. \nCounselors can accomplish much to shape and guide the academic experiences of students. They \nassist student self-development and further can acquaint students with the vocational training \npossibilities available in the system. It will be essential that the counselors become fully acquainted \nwith the vocational and technical offerings created herein. Accordingly, the order issued pursuant to \nthese guidelines will require that the Detroit Board provide guidance and counseling services, \nincluding career counseling to the junior and senior high students in the Detroit system.[18] The Board \nis hereby directed to submit a career guidance and counseling plan. \n9. Co-curricular Activities \nCo-curricular activities are essential supportive programs in a system undergoing desegregation. \nCo-curricular activities further desegregation by providing student-to-student contact and interplay in \na desegregated environment. The co-curricular program should include a provision for a limited \njunior high school consortium, which also encourages the sharing of educational experiences among \nstudents of both races. In addition to aiding desegregation, the co-curricular program can acquaint \nstudents 1144*1144with the many fine institutions available in the Detroit area, which have indicated \ntheir interest in aiding the court in providing quality education to Detroit school children. The junior \nhigh school consortium will enable students to share experiences while acquiring knowledge of such \ninstitutions as the Art Institute, the Detroit Public Library, the Merrill-Palmer Institute, Wayne State \nUniversity and Shaw College. The court has reviewed the provision for co-curricular activities in the \nBoard's plan and has concluded that it contains imaginative programs. The court's order will, \ntherefore, require that the Detroit Board develop for the court's approval a specific plan for co-\ncurricular activities including an analysis of the costs involved. \n\n10. Bilingual/Multi-Ethnic Studies \nMulti-ethnic studies are essential elements of the curriculum of any outstanding school system; \ndesegregation serves only to emphasize the need for inclusion of these studies. Moreover, by state \nlaw school districts are required to provide adequate programs for bilingual and bi-cultural \ninstruction. See Mich.Comp.Laws sections 340.360, 390, 391. The court order will further provide for \nthese programs. \nCurrently, these programs are funded by Titles III and VII of ESAA. The Board is directed to re-apply \nfor such funds to continue its program and in such application shall include provisions for in-service \ntraining for teachers involved in such programs. The Detroit Board is further directed to seek the \ncooperation of Wayne State University's Ethnic Learning Resource Center in developing a resource \nprogram for comprehensive multi-ethnic instruction. \nThe Board shall submit finalized programs for each of these studies to the court including provisions \nfor in-service training of the teachers involved.[19] \n11. Faculty Assignments \nThe Detroit Board's plan contains a component dealing with reassignment of faculty, providing for a \n50% ratio in every school. It has been noted that the teacher population in Detroit is now 49.5% \nblack and hence nearly evenly bi-racial. However, no evidence was presented at this remedial \nhearing dealing with faculty segregation. Thus, it would be inappropriate for this court to order any \nreassignment of faculty at this time. \nHowever, notwithstanding the prior holding of this court, affirmed on appeal, that the Detroit Board \nhad not committed de jure acts of segregation of faculty, certain reassignments will be necessary to \nimplement the desegregation order. Reassignments of faculty will be necessitated by the \nreassignments of students. Such faculty reassignments are incidental to the desegregation plan and \nshall be made with the purpose of further integrating the faculty. The Detroit Board and the Detroit \nFederation of Teachers shall immediately begin negotiations concerning reassignments necessitated \nby other components of this plan. Of course, in conducting these negotiations, both parties will no \ndoubt be mindful of the federal requirement for racial composition of faculty and staff in a school \nsystem undergoing desegregation contained in USCFR 185.44(d) (3), supra. \nThereafter, both parties shall submit a report listing every school, student enrollment by race, the \nprojected student enrollment by race following application of the plan, the present number of \nteachers in each school by race and the projected number of teachers by race following application \nof the court's order. These reports shall be submitted to the court prior to an evidentiary hearing to \nbe set by the court. \n1145*1145 12. Monitoring \nThe court's order will provide for a court-created monitoring system to audit efforts made to \nimplement the court's desegregation orders. The monitoring system created by the court shall \nprovide for broad citizen participation. The monitoring group shall reflect the city's racial and ethnic \ncomposition so that the court can receive input from a broad spectrum of the city's population. \n\nBecause it is the court's constitutional obligation to audit efforts to implement its orders, the \nmonitoring commission shall report directly to the court. The parties may, for the court's \nconsideration, nominate citizens for appointment to the monitoring commission. The court is of the \nview, however, that the state, to whom the Fourteenth Amendment is addressed, has an equal \nobligation to oversee the efforts put forth and results achieved through implementation of the \ndesegregation order. Accordingly, the court will order the State Superintendent of Public Instruction \nto seek the assistance of available state institutions to provide the supervisory and expert support \nstaff needed to analyze and report the information thus obtained. The State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction shall suggest to the court a plan that includes the assistance of state-supported \ninstitutions such as the Title IV center of the University of Michigan. \nIn the court's view the monitoring of its orders is an essential part of a deseggation effort. The court \nrecognizes that an effective monitoring procedure will require careful evaluation of the input from \ncitizens' groups appointed. These groups shall be requested to develop meaningful criteria for \nevaluation and to suggest and recommend methods for developing a uniform basis of reporting. It \nshall be the obligation of the State Superintendent and the institutions selected by him to collect and \nanalyze all such data submitted and to provide sufficient staff to supervise the work of the monitoring \ncommittee. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn developing these guidelines, this court has not intended to usurp the School Board's \nadministrative authority. Neither has this court intended to substitute its authority for the authority of \nelected state and local officials to decide which educational components are beneficial to the school \ncommunity. We are especially reluctant to do so in view of the fact that the school officials are willing \nto desegregate the school system. Their plan evidences their desire to cooperate in the \ndesegregative effort. Pursuant to an order of this court, they submitted a comprehensive \ndesegregation plan that did not attempt to rely solely upon their Magnet School Program for \nvoluntary desegregation but instead included the forced transportation of a large number of students. \nThus, we have taken into account that the \"good faith conduct on the part of any litigant in any court, \nespecially a court of equity and, more particularly, in the sensitive area of desegregation, is a vital \nelement for appropriate consideration.\" Montgomery County Board of Education v. Carr, 400 F.2d 1, \n2 (5th Cir. 1968). \nMoreover, even after a finding of segregation has been made, it is the affirmative duty of the local \nschool board to repair the effects of segregation by constructing a unitary system. But, at the same \ntime, once the state has been found to have discriminated against a class of plaintiffs, it is the \nconstitutional obligation of the court to assure that the denial of equal educational opportunity \nthrough segregation is fairly and justly remedied. Thus, the Board must remember that once it \nbegins to desegregate, \"the courts have a solemn obligation to determine whether the structure \ndesigned by the school board will house a unitary system. This obligation is unremitting . . \n. 1146*1146Accordingly, any imprimatur of judicial approval must be entered with the caveat that \nuntil construction of a unitary system is completed, change orders, when appropriate, will be issued \nto ensure that the designed structure in fact accommodates a unitary system and not a bifurcated \none.\" Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 429 F.2d 382, 386 (5th Cir. 1970). It is in this \ncontext that the court issues these guidelines. It is for the court to declare constitutional standards \napplicable in a particular school district. The Board is free to do more than these announced \nstandards require, so long as it demonstrates that its additional effort will have a salutary effect upon \ndesegregation; it is the role of the court to ensure that it does not do less than what we have detailed \nhere. \n\nA successful desegregative effort will require cooperation and support from the entire community. \nBecause Detroiters have always volunteered community support to advance worthwhile causes and \nbecause Detroiters know that the vitality of their city depends upon the excellence and stability of \ntheir school system, this court has already received expressions of support from the community. \nMany of Michigan's institutions of higher education, business corporations, labor unions and other \norganizations, public and private, have pledged their support and assistance to assure the \nsuccessful development of quality education in the newly desegregated Detroit School System. \nFor example, Wayne State University, in cooperation with other institutions, can undertake prime \nresponsibility in developing and conducting the in-service training program, which has received a \nhigh priority from this court.[20] Wayne County Community College has volunteered to consult with \nthe Board and to assist it in the development and evaluation of the Board's proposed multi-ethnic \ncomponent. It will further help with an orientation program for academic and guidance counselors. \nAdditionally, labor and industry have demonstrated an active interest in the quality of education in \nthe Detroit Schools. Both sectors of the community have assured the court of their willingness to \ncooperate and assist in this effort. Labor and industry can be of invaluable assistance by bringing \ntheir expertise to the vocational and technical high schools created herein. They can generate jobs \nfor young people and possibly provide equipment needed by the school district. They can also \nprovide opportunities for on-the-job training. It is hoped that the Board will succeed in matching \ncolleges, universities, labor and industry with selected schools or programs to further enhance the \nattractions available in the school system. The Board, with the aid of the court's experts, should \nenter into specific agreements with these organizations in order to spell out precisely the roles they \nwill play in assisting the Detroit schools. These institutions will not, of course, be solicited for \nfinancial contributions, nor do they intend to interfere with the administrative authority of the Detroit \nBoard. These institutions want to be of assistance to Detroit school children; they have no desire to \nparticipate in the administration of the school system. Thus, our guidelines provide the seeds to \ngenerate community support. \nThe guidelines also continue the magnet system to which the school community has devoted so \nmuch time and funds. We have sought to strengthen those programs now in existence and have \nalso provided for the creation of additional schools and added attractions, including the anticipated \nmatching of 1147*1147 schools with colleges, universities, business organizations and labor unions. \nAs strengthened, these magnet programs will provide an opportunity for the occurrence of voluntary \ndesegregation. Magnet programs, as a desegregation tool, have been approved by the Federal \nEducation Acts of 1974, P.L. 93-380, § 214(f), 20 U.S.C. § 1713(f), and as strengthened by the \ncourt's guidelines will be sufficiently attractive to serve the dual purpose of providing quality \neducation and voluntary desegregation. However, it must be remembered that the primary goal of \nthese magnet schools is to operate as desegregated schools taking account of the practicalities we \nhave deemed constitutionally permissible to consider. \nAlthough these magnet schools play an important role in the court's guidelines, this court recognizes \nthat total desegregation cannot come about through magnet programs alone. Since 1972, the \nmagnet program alone has proven inadequate to desegregate the Detroit Schools. However, while \nsome transportation may be essential, we believe that the guidelines proposed have substantially \nreduced the number of students transported from the number involved in either the plaintiffs' or the \nBoard's plan. \nThe cooperative effort of the entire community will assure a school system capable of fulfilling \ncommunity aspirations. Such community support will provide the Detroit schools with an opportunity \nto make a fresh start. Those once deprived of equal opportunity by past discrimination will be \nassured that their schools are unequaled elsewhere; they will be assured that the injury from \nsegregation, sometimes intangible, will be eradicated. With the support of the community, the court's \norder will create a unitary school system and assure that past discriminatory practices will neither \n\ninflict further injury nor occur again. A school system must evolve that is concerned not with black \nchildren or white children, but just children. \n[1] The District Court in 1971 predicted that in the 1975-1976 school year the black student enrollment would total 72 \npercent. The evidence taken during this remedial proceeding indicates that that figure was low. Black enrollment in the \nelementary schools exceeded 72% on September 27, 1974, and black enrollment system-wide on that date was 71.5%. \n[*] Woodward Avenue is a major thoroughfare in Detroit, which divides the city along east-west lines. \n[*] Elementary School Figures. \n[*] Elementary School Figures. \n[*] Schools that abut the Detroit city limits. \n[2] In addition, under plaintiffs' plan, the Columbus Junior High School would be over capacity were it not for the utilization of \ntemporary spaces. \n[3] We have arrived at varying estimates that range 77,000 and 81,000 students requiring transportation under plaintiffs' \nplan. \n[4] In addition to the 95 schools untouched by the pupil reassignment portion of the Board's plan, 16 schools that are already \ndesegregated according to the plaintiffs' definition are untouched, 6 elementary schools are not paired but are included in \ndesegregated feeder patterns and 6 schools are taken out of service. \n[5] See State Critique of Detroit Board's Desegregation Plan, page 39. \n[6] Defendant Board's plan, according to the court's count, would transport between 51,000-56,000 students, affecting 159 \nschools. The plaintiffs' plan, according to our count, would bus between 77,000-81,000 students and affect virtually every \nschool in the system. \n[7] The defendant Board took its first step to desegregate the school system as early as 1970 when it attempted to \nimplement the April 7, 1970 plan. This attempt was frustrated only by acts of the Michigan Legislature. \n[8] The district court's ruling on the Detroit-only desegregation plan is set out in full by the Court of Appeals, id.,at 242-245, \nand and is not otherwise officially reported. \n[9] In addition, it would be unwise for the court to consider white flight in view of the fact that there is an abundance of \nliterature acknowledging that white flight is perceived more as a function of class than race or resistance to desegregative \norders. See Nancy St. John, School Desegregation, Outcomes for Children, John Wiley & Sons, New York. \n[10] In Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971) the district courts are \nreminded that a desegregation case is no different than an ordinary case in equity. The court stated: \"The task is to correct, \nby a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution.\" \n[11] Although the plaintiffs attempted to desegregate by rezoning attendance areas, it is this court's belief that their failure to \ndo so was a result of their definition of a desegregated school. There is no evidence in the record that, given this court's \nmore flexible approach to desegregation, rezoning attendance areas will not be a useful desegregative tool. \n[12] For example, in the Southwest Constellation, the Carrie School is paired although it is already 58% black. In the \nChadsey Constellation, the Hanneman School is 58% black. Moreover, the Board plan sometimes precludes students within \nwalking distance of a school from going to that school. For example, the Burt Elementary attendance zone is in the Redford \narea, yet Burt students have been assigned to Cooley rather than Redford. Similarly, students in the Schultz attendance \nzone should go to Mumford, yet they are assigned to Redford. \n[13] Another factor that the Board may wish to consider in making its pairings is the \"Weighted Poverty Index\" of each \nschool, which varies in Detroit from 0.18 to well over 40. The socio-economic mix, as measured by the poverty index, is a \n\nsignificant factor and should be considered along with the racial mix. As far as possible, the Board should strive to have no \nschool with a poverty index greater than 15. \n[14] See section on Vocational Education, infra. \n[15] We direct the General Superintendent's attention to the Public Report of the Education Task Force, as revised March 5, \n1975. The recommendations with respect to development of a reading program and suggestions contained therein are \nendorsed herein. \n[16] The Board's plan as submitted does not distinguish clearly between courses to be offered at the vocational centers and \nthe technical high schools. The study should identify the offering of courses duplicating those at other high schools; \nduplication might detract from the magnet programs instituted at the two new technical high schools. The study should \nfurther determine the effect of duplication of courses at different locations upon desegregation and the quality of education. \n[17] See this court's order of July 3, 1975. \n[18] It is not for the court to determine how this program ought to be staffed. We note, however, that we are unaware of any \nschool system that has deemed it beneficial to assign full-time counselors at the elementary school level. Some school \nsystems have found that classroom teachers who are afforded appropriate in-service training make the best counselors at \nthe elementary level. \n[19] While we endorse the inclusion of these programs in a desegregation plan, we draw no conclusions with respect to the \nbudget submitted by the Board in its plan, which appears to us to be excessive. Even assuming 163 bilingual teachers are \nneeded, there should be a corresponding reduction in the number of regular classroom teachers. \n[20] We are informed at this writing that the Governor of the State of Michigan is aware of Detroit's need for this component. \nWe have reason to believe that, consistent with his abiding interest in Michigan's educational system, he will approve \nnecessary budgetary provisions to enable Wayne State University to participate. \n ",

Having \nfound a constitutional violation as established, on October 4, 1971 the court directed the school \nboard defendants, City and State, to develop and submit plans of desegregation, designed to \nachieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of \nthe situation. The directive called for the submission of both a \"Detroit-only\" and a \"Metropolitan\" \nplan. \nPlans for the desegregation of the Detroit schools were submitted by the Detroit Board of Education \nand by the plaintiffs. Following five days of hearings the court found that while plaintiffs' plan would \naccomplish more desegregation than now obtains in the system, or which would be achieved under \neither Plan A or C of the Detroit Board of Education submissions, none of the plans would result in \nthe desegregation of the public schools of the Detroit school district. The court, in its findings of fact \nand conclusions of law, concluded that \"relief of segregation in the Detroit public schools cannot be \naccomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city,\" and that it had the authority and \nthe duty to look beyond such limits for a solution to the illegal segregation in the Detroit public \nschools. Accordingly, the court ruled, it had to consider a metropolitan remedy for segregation. \nThe parties submitted a number of plans for metropolitan desegregation. The State Board of \nEducation submitted six—without recommendation, and without indicating any preference. With the \nexception of one of these, none could be considered as designed to accomplish desegregation. On \nthe other hand the proposals of intervening defendant Magdowski, et al., the Detroit Board of \nEducation and the plaintiffs were all good faith efforts to accomplish desegregation in the Detroit \nmetropolitan area. The three plans submitted by these parties have many similarities, and all of them \npropose to incorporate, geographically, most—and in one instance, all—of the three-county area of \nWayne, Oakland and Macomb. \nThe hearing on the proposals have set the framework, and have articulated the criteria and \nconsiderations, for developing and evaluating an effective plan of metropolitan desegregation. None \nof the submissions represent a complete plan for the effective and equitable desegregation of the \nmetropolitan area, capable of implementation in its present form. The court will therefore draw upon \nthe resources of the parties to devise, pursuant to its direction, a constitutional plan of desegregation \nof the Detroit public schools. \nBased on the entire record herein, the previous oral and written rulings and orders of this court, and \nthe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed herewith, it is ordered: \n\nI. \nA. As a panel charged with the responsibility of preparing and submitting an effective desegregation \nplan in 917*917 accordance with the provisions of this order, the court appoints the following:[*] \n1. A designee of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction;[**] \n2. Harold Wagner, Supervisor of the Transportation Unit in the Safety and Traffic Education Program \nof the State Department of Education; \n3. Merle Henrickson, Detroit Board of Education; \n4. Aubrey McCutcheon, Detroit Board of Education; \n5. Freeman Flynn, Detroit Board of Education; \n6. Gordon Foster, expert for plaintiffs; \n7. Richard Morshead, representing defendant Magdowski, et al.; \n8. A designee of the newly intervening defendants;[**] \n9. Rita Scott, of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. \nShould any designated member of this panel be unable to serve, the other members of the panel \nshall elect any necessary replacements, upon notice to the court and the parties. In the absence of \nobjections within five days of the notice, and pending a final ruling, such designated replacement \nshall act as a member of the panel. \nB. As soon as possible, but in no event later than 45 days after the issuance of this order, the panel \nis to develop a plan for the assignment of pupils as set forth below in order to provide the maximum \nactual desegregation, and shall develop as well a plan for the transportation of pupils, for \nimplementation for all grades, schools and clusters in the desegregation area. Insofar as required by \nthe circumstances, which are to be detailed in particular, the panel may recommend immediate \nimplementation of an interim desegregation plan for grades K-6, K-8 or K-9 in all or in as many \nclusters as practicable, with complete and final desegregation to proceed in no event later than the \nfall 1973 term. In its transportation plan the panel shall, to meet the needs of the proposed pupil \nassignment plan, make recommendations, including the shortest possible timetable, for acquiring \nsufficient additional transportation facilities for any interim or final plan of desegregation. Such \nrecommendations shall be filed forthwith and in no event later than 45 days after the entry of this \norder. Should it develop that some additional transportation equipment is needed for an interim plan, \nthe panel shall make recommendations for such acquisition within 20 days of this order. \nC. The parties, their agents, employees, successors. and all others having actual notice of this order \nshall cooperate fully with the panel in their assigned mission, including, but not limited to, the \nprovision of data and reasonable full and part-time staff assistance as requested by the panel. The \nState defendants shall provide support, accreditation, funds, and otherwise take all actions \nnecessary to insure that local officials and employees cooperate fully with 918*918 the panel. All \nreasonable costs incurred by the panel shall be borne by the State defendants; provided, however, \nthat staff assistance or other services provided by any school district, its employees or agents, shall \nbe without charge, and the cost thereof shall be borne by such school district. \nII. \nA. Pupil reassignment to accomplish desegregation of the Detroit public schools is required within \nthe geographical area which may be described as encompassing the following school districts (see \nExhibit P.M. 12), and hereinafter referred to as the \"desegregation area\": \nLakeshore          Birmingham          Fairlane \n\nLakeview           Hazel Park          Garden City \nRoseville          Highland Park       North Dearborn Heights \nSouth Lake         Royal Oak           Cherry Hill \nEast Detroit       Berkley             Inkster \nGrosse Pointe      Ferndale            Wayne \nCenterline         Southfield          Westwood \nFitzgerald         Bloomfield Hills    Ecorse \nVan Dyke           Oak Park            Romulus \nFraser             Redford Union       Taylor \nHarper Woods       West Bloomfield     River Rouge \nWarren             Clarenceville       Riverview \nWarren Woods       Farmington          Wyandotte \nClawson            Livonia             Allen Park \nHamtramck          South Redford       Lincoln Park \nLamphere           Crestwood           Melvindale \nMadison Heights    Dearborn            Southgate \nTroy               Dearborn Heights    Detroit \nProvided, however, that if in the actual assignment of pupils it appears necessary and feasible to \nachieve effective and complete racial desegregation to reassign pupils of another district or other \ndistricts, the desegregation panel may, upon notice to the parties, apply to the court for an \nappropriate modification of this order. \nB. Within the limitations of reasonable travel time and distance factors, pupil reassignments shall be \neffected within the clusters described in Exhibit P. M. 12 so as to achieve the greatest degree of \nactual desegregation to the end that, upon implementation, no school, grade or classroom be \nsubstantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition. The panel may, upon notice to \nthe parties, recommend reorganization of clusters within the desegregation area in order to minimize \nadministrative inconvenience, or time and/or numbers of pupils requiring transportation. \nC. Appropriate and safe transportation arrangements shall be made available without cost to all \npupils assigned to schools deemed by the panel to be other than \"walk-in\" schools. \nD. Consistent with the requirements of maximum actual desegregation, every effort should be made \nto minimize the numbers of pupils to be reassigned and requiring transportation, the time pupils \nspend in transit, and the number and cost of new transportation facilities to be acquired by utilizing \nsuch techniques as clustering, the \"skip\" technique, island zoning, reasonable staggering of school \nhours, and maximization of use of existing transportation facilities, including buses owned or leased \nby school districts and buses operated by public transit authorities and private charter companies. \nThe panel shall develop appropriate 919*919 recommendations for limiting transfers which affect the \ndesegregation of particular schools. \nE. Transportation and pupil assignment shall, to the extent consistent with maximum feasible \ndesegregation, be a two-way process with both black and white pupils sharing the responsibility for \ntransportation requirements at all grade levels. In the determination of the utilization of existing, and \nthe construction of new, facilities, care shall be taken to randomize the location of particular grade \nlevels. \nF. Faculty and staff shall be reassigned, in keeping with pupil desegregation, so as to prevent the \ncreation or continuation of the identification of schools by reference to past racial composition, or the \ncontinuation of substantially disproportionate racial composition of the faculty and staffs, of the \nschools in the desegregation area. The faculty and staffs assigned to the schools within the \ndesegregation area shall be substantially desegregated, bearing in mind, however, that the \n\ndesideratum is the balance of faculty and staff by qualifications for subject and grade level, and then \nby race, experience and sex. In the context of the evidence in this case, it is appropriate to require \nassignment of no less than 10% black faculty and staff at each school, and where there is more than \none building administrator, every effort should be made to assign a bi-racial administrative team. \nG. In the hiring, assignment, promotion, demotion, and dismissal of faculty and staff, racially non-\ndiscriminatory criteria must be developed and used; provided, however, there shall be no reduction \nin efforts to increase minority group representation among faculty and staff in the desegregation \narea. Affirmative action shall be taken to increase minority employment in all levels of teaching and \nadministration. \nH. The restructuring of school facility utilization necessitated by pupil reassignments should produce \nschools of substantially like quality, facilities, extracurricular activities and staffs; and the utilization of \nexisting school capacity through the desegregation area shall be made on the basis of uniform \ncriteria. \nI. The State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Education shall with respect to all \nschool construction and expansion, \"consider the factor of racial balance along with other \neducational considerations in making decisions about new school sites, expansion of present \nfacilities * * *\"; and shall, within the desegregation area disapprove all proposals for new construction \nor expansion of existing facilities when \"housing patterns in an area would result in a school largely \nsegregated on racial * * * lines,\" all in accordance with the 1966 directive issued by the State Board \nof Education of local school boards and the State Board's \"School Plant Planning Handbook\" (see \nRuling on Issue of Segregation, p. 13.). \nJ. Pending further orders of the court, existing school district and regional boundaries and school \ngovernance arrangements will be maintained and continued, except to the extent necessary to effect \npupil and faculty desegregation as set forth herein; provided, however, that existing administrative, \nfinancial, contractual, property and governance arrangements shall be examined, and \nrecommendations for their temporary and permanent retention or modification shall be made, in light \nof the need to operate an effectively desegregated system of schools. \nK. At each school within the desegregated area provision shall be made to insure that the \ncurriculum, activities, and conduct standards respect the diversity of students from differing ethnic \nbackgrounds and the dignity and safety of each individual, students, faculty, staff and parents. \nL. The defendants shall, to insure the effective desegregation of the schools in the desegregation \narea, take immediate action including, but not limited to, the establishment or expansion of in-service \ntraining of faculty and staff, create bi-racial committees, employ black counselors, and require bi-\nracial 920*920 and non-discriminatory extra-curricular activities. \nIII. \nThe State Superintendent of Public Instruction, with the assistance of the other state defendants, \nshall examine, and make recommendations, consistent with the principles established above, for \nappropriate interim and final arrangements for the (1) financial, (2) administrative and school \ngovernance, and (3) contractual arrangements for the operation of the schools within the \ndesegregation area, including steps for unifying, or otherwise making uniform the personnel policies, \nprocedures, contracts, and property arrangements of the various school districts. \n\nWithin 15 days of the entry of this order, the Superintendent shall advise the court and the parties of \nhis progress in preparing such recommendations by filing a written report with the court and serving \nit on the parties. In not later than 45 days after the entry of this order, the Superintendent shall file \nwith the court his recommendations for appropriate interim and final relief in these respects. \nIn his examination and recommendations, the Superintendent, consistent with the rulings and orders \nof this court, may be guided, but not limited, by existing state law; where state law provides a \nconvenient and adequate framework for interim or ultimate relief, it should be followed, where state \nlaw either is silent or conflicts with what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this order, the \nSuperintendent shall independently recommend what he deems necessary. In particular, the \nSuperintendent shall examine and choose one appropriate interim arrangement to oversee the \nimmediate implementation of a plan of desegregation. \nIV. \nEach party may file appropriate plans or proposals for inclusion in any final order which may issue in \nthis cause. The intent of this order is to permit all the parties to proceed apace with the task before \nus: fashioning an effective plan for the desegregation of the Detroit public schools. \nFifteen days after the filing of the reports required herein, hearings will begin on any proposal to \nmodify any interim plan prepared by the panel and all other matters which may be incident to the \nadoption and implementation of any interim plan of desegregation submitted. The parties are placed \non notice that they are to be prepared at that time to present their objections, alternatives and \nmodifications. At such hearing the court will not consider objections to desegregation or proposals \noffered \"instead\" of desegregation. \nHearings on a final plan of desegregation will be set as circumstances require. \nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN \nSUPPORT OF RULING ON DESEGREGATION AREA \nAND DEVELOPMENT OF PLAN \nOn the basis of the entire record in this action, including particularly the evidence heard by the court \nfrom March 28 through April 14, 1972, the court now makes the following Supplementary Findings of \nFact and Conclusions of Law. It should be noted that the court has taken no proofs with respect to \nthe establishment of the boundaries of the 86 public school districts in the counties of Wayne, \nOakland and Macomb, nor on the issue of whether, with the exclusion of the city of Detroit school \ndistrict, such school districts have committed acts of de jure segregation. \nINTRODUCTION \n1. On September 27, 1971, this court issued its Ruling on Issue of Segregation. On October 4, 1971, \nthis court issued from the bench guidelines to bind the parties in the submission of plans to remedy \nthe constitutional violation found, i. e., school segregation; and in particular this court noted that the \nprimary objective before us was to develop and implement a plan which attempts \nto 921*921 \"achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the \npracticalities of the situation.\" The same day this court reiterated these requirements by orders \"that \nthe Detroit Board of Education submit a plan for the desegregation of its schools within 60 days\" and \n\n\"that the State defendants submit a metropolitan plan of desegregation within 120 days.\" In \nresponse to these orders hearings were held, and thereafter rulings issued, on Detroit-only plans \n(see Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-Only Plans of Desegregation) and on the \npropriety of considering remedies which extend beyond the corporate geographic limits of the city of \nDetroit. (See Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy to Accomplish \nDesegregation of the Public Schools of the City of Detroit.) Between March 28, 1972 and April 14, \n1972, hearings were held on metropolitan proposals for desegregation of the Detroit public schools. \n2. From the initial ruling on September 27, 1971, to this day, the basis of the proceedings has been \nand remains the violation: de jure school segregation. Since Brown v. Board of Education the \nSupreme Court has consistently held that the remedy for such illegal segregation is desegregation. \nThe racial history of this country is writ large by constitutional adjudication from Dred Scott v. \nSanford to Plessy v. Ferguson to Brown.The message in Brown was simple: the Fourteenth \nAmendment was to be applied full force in public schooling. The Court held that \"state-imposed\" \nschool segregation immeasurably taints the education received by all children in the public schools; \nperpetuates racial discrimination and a history of public action attaching a badge of inferiority to the \nblack race in a public forum which importantly shapes the minds and hearts of succeeding \ngenerations of our young people; and amounts to an invidious racial classification. Since Brown the \nSupreme Court has consistently, and with increasing force, held that the remedy upon finding de jure \nsegregation is prompt and maximum actual desegregation of the public schools by all reasonable, \nfeasible, and practicable means available. This court finds that there is nothing in the law, wisdom, \nor facts, and the particular circumstances and arguments, presented in this case, which suggests \nanything except the affirmance of these principles in both fact and law. \n3. The task before this court, therefore, is now, and, since September 27, 1971, has always been, \nhow to desegregate the Detroit public schools. The issue, despite efforts of the intervenors to \nsuggest a new rationale for a return to the discredited \"separate but equal\" policy,[1] is not whether to \ndesegregate. 922*922 That question has been foreclosed by the prior and settled commands of the \nSupreme Court and the Sixth Circuit. Our duty now is to \"grapple with the flinty, intractable \nrealities\"[2] of implementing the constitutional commands. \n4. In the most recent set of hearings, several issues were addressed generally, including appropriate \nmethods of pupil reassignment to desegregate schools; quality and capacity of school facilities; \ntransportation needs incident to school desegregation; the effects of new school construction, and \njudicially established controls thereon, on any plan of desegregation; the reassignment of faculty and \nrestructuring of facilities incident to pupil reassignment to accomplish school desegregation; \nappropriate and necessary interim and final administrative and financial arrangements; appropriate \ncommunity, parental, staff, and pupil involvement in the desegregation process; and attention to \nindividual, cultural, and ethnic values, respect, dignity and identity. But the primary question \naddressed by these hearings, in the absence of submission of a complete desegregation plan by the \nstate, remains the determination of the area necessary and practicable effectively to eliminate \"root \nand branch\" the effects of state-imposed and supported segregation and to desegregate the Detroit \npublic schools. \nSUPPLEMENTARY FINDINGS OF FACT \nA. The Desegregation Area \n5. The State Board of Education filed six (6) \"plans\" without recommendation or preference; \nintervening defendants Magdowski, et al., filed a proposal for metropolitan desegregation which \nincluded most of the tri-county area; the defendant Detroit Board of Education filed a proposal for \n\nmetropolitan desegregation which included the entire tri-county area.[3] At the hearing plaintiffs \npresented a modification of the three proposals which actually described areas within which pupil \ndesegregation was to be accomplished. \n6. In the consideration of metropolitan plans of desegregation of the Detroit public schools, the State \ndefendants stand as the primary defendants. They bear the initial burden of coming forward with a \nproposal that promises to work. In the context of this case, they represent the \"school \nauthorities\"[4] to whom equity courts traditionally have 923*923 shown deference in these \nmatters.[5] Yet in its submission without recommendation of six (6) \"plans\" the State Board of \nEducation has failed to meet, or even attempt to meet, that burden and none of the other State \ndefendants has filled the void. \n7. The State Board refused to make any recommendation to the court about the appropriate area for \ndesegregation. In State Defendant Porter's words, the State Board \"didn't make a decision, period.\" \nDefendants Milliken and Kelley merely filed objections to all six (6) plans. \n8. Three of the State \"plans\" merely proposed concepts alternative to maximum actual \ndesegregation. The Racial Proportion Plan described a statistical method of determining the number \nof transfers involved in achieving a particular racial ratio in each school once an area of \ndesegregation had been chosen. The Equal Educational Opportunity and Quality Integration Plan \nwas admitted to be a non-plan and described criteria for education which, in whole or part, might, or \nmight not, be applicable to any school system. \n9. Only one State \"plan,\" the Metropolitan District Reorganization Plan, attempted to describe an \narea within which desegregation should occur, called the \"initial operating zone\" (sometimes referred \nto hereafter as the \"State Proposal\"). That \"plan,\" however, was primarily concerned with discussing \na new governance structure for the desegregation area. Pupil reassignment was mentioned only in \npassing and no foundation was laid by State defendants for the particular area of desegregation \ndescribed. Further, it suffered from the default of the State defendants by their stubborn insistence \nthat under their self-serving, and therefore self-limiting, view of their powers they were free to ignore \nthe clear order of this court and abdicate their responsibility vested in them by both the Michigan and \nFederal Constitution for supervision of public education and equal protection for all citizens. \n10. From the very limited evidence in the record in support of the area in that state proposal, the \nprimary foundation appears to be the particular racial ratio attained in that plan, approximately 65% \nblack, 35% white, with the provision that the area could be expanded if \"white flight\" ensued. In the \nabsence of any other persuasive foundation, such area is not based on any definable or legally \nsustainable criteria for either inclusion or exclusion of particular areas; and the concept of an \"initial \noperating zone\" raises serious practical questions, which should be avoided if a more permanent \nsolution is now possible. In short, the area described by the \"initial operating zone\" does not appear \nto be based primarily on relevant factors, like eliminating racially identifiable schools; accomplishing \nmaximum actual desegregation of the Detroit public schools; or avoiding, where possible, \nmaintaining a pattern of schools substantially disproportionate to the relevant school community's \nracial composition by force of deliberate action by public authority. Nor, on the evidence in this \nrecord, is the \"initial operating zone\" based on any practical limitation of reasonable times and \ndistances for transportation of pupils. These factors seem to have played little part in the creation of \nthe \"initial operating zone\" and are reflected less in its result. \n11. At the hearings, moreover, the State defendants did not purport to present evidence in support, \nor even in opposition, to the State Proposal. The State, despite prodding by the court, presented \nonly one witness, who merely 924*924 explained what appeared on the face of the various State \n\"Plans\" submitted. The State's cross examination of witnesses was of no assistance to the court in \n\nascertaining any preference, legal or educational. Put bluntly, State defendants in this hearing \ndeliberately chose not to assist the court in choosing an appropriate area for effective desegregation \nof the Detroit public schools. Their resistance and abdication of responsibility throughout has been \nconsistent with the other failures to meet their obligations noted in the court's earlier rulings. Indeed, \nsome of the submissions spoke as clearly in opposition to desegregation as did the legislature in \nSec. 12 of Act 48 of 1970, M.C.L.A. § 388.182 ruled unconstitutional by the Sixth Circuit. \n12. In such circumstances little weight or deference can be given to the unsupported submission of \nthe State Board of Education. In light of the available alternatives and the facts produced at the \nhearing bearing on the issue, the court finds that State defendants offered no basis for ruling that the \n\"initial operating zone\" is the appropriate area within which to effectively desegregate the Detroit \npublic schools. \n13. Similarly, the newly intervening, defendant school districts did not attempt at the hearing to assist \nthe court in determining which area was appropriate to accomplish effective desegregation. They \nwere given the opportunity, by express written order and several admonitions during the course of \nthe hearings, to assist the court in the task at hand but chose in their best judgment instead, in the \nmain, to suggest their view that separate schools were preferable. The failure of the group of 40 \ndistricts to even comment that the court should exclude certain districts under any number of \navailable rationales may in part be explained by the awkward position chosen by them and their \ncounsel of having single representation for districts on different sides of the various suggested \nperimeters. \n14. The plans of intervening defendants Magdowski, et al., and the defendant Detroit Board of \nEducation are similar. With slight variations they include the entire tri-county, metropolitan Detroit \narea, with that area divided into several regions or clusters to make the planning for accomplishing \ndesegregation more manageable. Although both have as their main objective desegregation, their \nlarger area arises primarily from a heavy emphasis on such factors as white flight and an appropriate \nsocio-economic balance in each cluster and school.[6] \n15. The authors of the Detroit Board and Magdowski plans readily admit that the regions or clusters \nfor pupil reassignment which involve Mt. Clemens and Pontiac are not directly related to \ndesegregation of the Detroit public schools and may be disregarded without any substantial adverse \neffect on accomplishing our objective. No other party has expressed any disagreement with \nthat 925*925 view. And the court finds that these two regions or clusters, for purposes of pupil \nreassignment, need not be included at this time in the desegregation area. \n16. With the elimination of these two clusters there are, then, three basic proposals to be considered \nfor the desegregation area: the State Proposal; the Detroit Board Proposal, and the proposal of \ndefendant-intervenors Magdowski, et al. In addition, as noted, plaintiffs filed a modification of these \nthree proposals. \n17. Each of these proposals starts from the same two premises: (1) the tri-county area[7]constitutes \nthe relevant school community which can serve as an initial benchmark in beginning the evaluation \nof how to effectively eliminate the racial segregation of Detroit schools; (2) but in some instances \nreasonable time and distance limitations for pupil transportation, and in other instances the actual \narea required to eliminate the pattern of racially identifiable schools, limit the area within which pupil \nreassignment should occur. In terms of proof, putting aside arguments of impotence by the State \ndefendants, there was absolutely no contradictory evidence on these two criteria. The entire tri-\ncounty area includes areas, pupils, and schools in 86 school districts; it includes approximately one \nmillion students, of whom approximately 20% are black. Based on the evidence concerning school \n\nand non-school factors,[8] and reasonable time and distance limitations for pupil transportation, the \ncourt finds that both premises are accurate.[9] \n18. The State Proposal includes the areas, pupils and school in 36 school districts; approximately \n550,000 students are included of whom 36% are black. The Detroit Board Proposal (excluding \nclusters 8 and 12) includes the areas, pupils, and schools in 69 school districts; approximately \n850,000 students are included, of whom 25% are minority.[10] The CCBE Proposal includes the \nareas, pupils, and schools in some 62 school districts; approximately 777,000 students are included \nof whom 197,000 (25.4%) are black. Plaintiffs' Proposal includes the areas, pupils, and schools in 54 \nschool districts; approximately 780,000 students are included, of whom 197,000 (25.3%) are black. \n19. The State Proposal approaches what may be considered a substantial 926*926disproportion in \nthe context of this case. It is to be remembered that within any desegregation area, the racial \ncomposition of desegregated schools will vary from the area's racial mix. Given the variations in \nschool plant, demographic and geographic factors, limiting the desegregation area to the State \nProposal would result in some schools being substantially disproportionate in their racial composition \nto the tri-county area, and other schools racially identifiable, all without any justification in law or fact. \nThis finding is supported by the lack of any apparent justification for the desegregation area \ndescribed by the State Proposal except a desire to achieve an arbitrary racial ratio. \n20. Transportation of children by school bus is a common practice throughout the nation, in the state \nof Michigan, and in the tri-county area. Within appropriate time limits it is a considerably safer, more \nreliable, healthful and efficient means of getting children to school than either car pools or walking, \nand this is especially true for younger children. \n21. In Michigan and the tri-county area, pupils often spend upwards of one hour, and up to one and \none half hours, one-way on the bus ride to school each day. Consistent with its interest in the health, \nwelfare and safety of children and in avoiding impingement on the educational process, state \neducational authorities routinely fund such transportation for school children. Such transportation of \nschool children is a long-standing, sound practice in elementary and secondary education in this \nstate and throughout the country. And the court finds such transportation times, used by the state \nand recommended here, are reasonable in the circumstance here presented and will not endanger \nthe health or safety of the child nor impinge on the educational process. For school authorities or \nprivate citizens to now object to such transportation practices raises the inference not of hostility to \npupil transportation but rather racially motivated hostility to the desegregated school at the end of the \nride. \n22. The Plaintiffs' Proposal made reference to P.M. 8, based on the TALUS regional transportation \nand travel times study. Although there was dispute over the meaning of the study, such studies are \ndeemed sufficiently reliable that major governmental agencies customarily rely on their projection for \na variety of planning functions. When used by the plaintiffs, P.M. 8, in conjunction with the Detroit \nBoard's survey of maximum school to school travel times, served as a rough guideline within which \nthe plaintiffs' modification of other proposals attempted to stay in an effort to provide maximum \ndesegregation without any more transportation time than is required to desegregate. This court finds \nthat the utilization of these two factors, and the lower travel time estimates which should result, is a \nreasonable basis for the modification in the circumstances of this case. The court's duty and \nobjective is not to maximize transportation but to maximize desegregation and within that standard it \nwill always be reasonable to minimize transportation. To that end the court has accepted the more \nconservative perimeter for the desegregation area suggested as a modification by plaintiffs because \nit provides no less effective desegregation. \n23. Based on these criteria, the State Proposal is too narrowly drawn. \n\n24. Based on these criteria, parts of the Detroit Board Proposal are too sweeping. \n25. Based on these criteria, the CCBE Proposal and the Plaintiffs' Proposal, roughly approximate the \narea so described.[11] \n26. There is general agreement among the parties, and the court so finds, that on the west the \nareas, 927*927 schools, and pupils in the Huron, Van Buren, Northville, Plymouth, and Novi \ndistricts[12] (1) are beyond the rough 40-minute travel time line; (2) are not necessary to effectively \ndesegregate schools involved in the regions and clusters abutting those schools; and, (3) at this \nwriting, are not otherwise necessary, insofar as pupil assignment is concerned, to provide an \neffective remedy now and hereafter. (See Findings 63-69 below.) \n27. In the southwest the school districts of Woodhaven, Gilbralter, Flat Rock, Grosse Ile and Trenton \nare within reasonable time and distance criteria set forth above. These virtually all-white districts are \nincluded in the Detroit Board Proposal but excluded from the plaintiffs' modification. The areas, \nschools and pupils in such school districts are similarly not necessary to effectively desegregate. \n(Clusters 13, 14, and 15 in Plaintiffs' Proposal are 20.5%, 24.4% and 22.7% black respectively.) \nThere is nothing in the record which suggests that these districts need be included in the \ndesegregation area in order to disestablish the racial identifiability of the Detroit public schools. From \nthe evidence, the primary reason for the Detroit School Board's interest in the inclusion of these \nschool districts is not racial desegregation but to increase the average socio-economic balance of all \nthe schools in the abutting regions and clusters. In terms of what this court views as the primary \nobligation established by the Constitution—racial desegregation—the court deems the proper \napproach is to be more conservative: the court finds it appropriate to confine the desegregation area \nto its smallest effective limits. This court weighs more heavily the judicially recognized concern for \nlimiting the time and distance of pupil transportation as much as possible, consistent with the \nconstitutional requirement to eliminate racially identifiable schools, than a concern for expanding the \ndesegregation area to raise somewhat the average socio-economic balance of a relatively few \nclusters of schools.[13] \n28. To the north and northeast, the only major disagreement among the Detroit Board Proposal and \nplaintiffs1 modification relates to the areas, schools, and pupils in the Utica School District. This \ndistrict is a virtually all-white, long, relatively narrow area extending several miles in a north-south \ndirection away from the city of Detroit. Only the southern part of the district is within the rough, \nTALUS 40-minute travel time line. \n29. The Detroit Board argues that Utica should be included in order to raise the average socio-\neconomic balance of the abutting clusters and schools. In this instance, however, the overall racial \ncomposition of the cluster, 27.0% black, may tend toward disproportionate black relative to the tri-\ncounty starting point. \n30. Mr. Henrickson, the planner for the Board, also suggested that Cluster 3 of Plaintiffs' Proposal, \nbecause of its omission of Utica, might present some problems, which he admitted could be solved, \nin designing a plan of pupil reassignment for the desegregation of schools. (See Findings 34-39 \nbelow.) \n31. In light of these relevant, and competing, considerations the question presented by the Utica \nsituation is close; however, at this writing, the 928*928 court determines that the areas, schools, and \npupils in the Utica School District need not be included, and therefore, should not be included in the \ndesegregation area.[14] \n\n32. The court finds that the appropriate desegregation area is described by plaintiffs' modification of \nthe three primary proposals. Within that area the racial identifiability of schools may be \ndisestablished by implementation of an appropriate pupil desegregation plan. The area as a whole is \nsubstantially proportionate to the tri-county starting point. Within the area it is practicable, feasible, \nand sound to effectively desegregate all schools without imposing any undue transportation burden \non the children or on the state's system of public schooling. The time or distance children need be \ntransported to desegregate schools in the area will impose no risk to the children's health and will \nnot significantly impinge on the educational process. \nB. Clusters \n33. The Detroit Board Proposal makes use of 16 regions or clusters. These clusters range from \n36,000 to 105,000 pupils and from 17.5% to 29.7% \"minority.\" The clusters are arranged along major \nsurface arteries and utilize the \"skip,\" or noncontiguous zoning, technique to minimize the time and \ndistance any child need spend in transit. The use of these clusters basically subdivides the planning \nfor pupil reassignment within the desegregation area into a series of smaller, manageable and \nbasically independent plans. Thus, although as the new intervenors suggest devising a \ndesegregation plan for a system with some 800,000 pupils has never been attempted, the practical \nand manageable reality is that desegregation plans for systems with from 36,000 to 100,000 pupils \nhas been done and such plans have been implemented. \n34. Plaintiffs' Proposal uses the same cluster technique and the same clusters, modified to fit the \ndesegregation area. The 15 clusters range from 27,000 to 93,000 pupils and from 20.5% to 30.8% \nblack. Only three relevant objections were raised by Mr. Henrickson, to the clusters as modified. \n35. First, Cluster 4 was challenged as \"concealing\" a \"problem,\" namely effective desegregation of \nother schools resulting from the omission of Utica from plaintiffs' modification. On cross-examination \nMr. Henrickson admitted that the \"problem\" of actual pupil desegregation for these other schools \ncould be \"solved,\" that all schools within Cluster 4 could be effectively desegregated, and that \nCluster 4 was smaller than the Detroit Board Cluster 6. The objection was thus narrowed to the \npossibility that a suburban high school constellation feeder pattern might have to be split between \ntwo Detroit high school constellation feeder patterns in order to desegregate. Several of the Detroit \nBoard's clusters, however, also contain two Detroit high school feeder patterns. \n36. This objection, splitting an existing feeder pattern, was raised directly in reference to Cluster 12. \nIn neither instance, however, did Mr. Henrickson suggest that the time or distance of transportation \ninvolved was too long or that it would present administrative difficulty in devising a pupil assignment \nplan for either cluster. The objection relates solely to a matter of administrative convenience, namely \nthe use of existing feeder patterns in preparing pupil assignments. For example, Mr. Henrickson \npreviously admitted that in drawing a pupil assignment plan, an alternative to use of existing feeder \npatterns would be to \"wipe the slate clean,\" 929*929 and disregard existing feeder patterns. In fact \none of the State plans suggested use of census tracts as an alternative.[15] On numerous occasions \nin the past Mr. Henrickson himself has reassigned parts of one feeder pattern to another school in \norder to relieve overcrowding and/or accomplish desegregation. The objection to such practice, \ntherefore, is admittedly insubstantial. \n37. The third objection relates to the exchange of Detroit Northern for Detroit Murray in Clusters 6 \nand 15 requiring that the students transported, if they proceed on their entire journey by way of the \nexpressway, encounter an interchange which tends to be rather slow-moving. Such transportation \ntime and distance, however, is well within the rough criteria for reasonableness and is shorter than \nor comparable to the maximum trips required in the Detroit Board's clusters. In other instances, Mr. \n\nHenrickson admitted that pupils in the Detroit proposal might also have to travel through similar \ninterchanges. Moreover, the objection to this particular increase in travel time must be weighed \nagainst the apparent general decrease in time which would be required in plaintiffs' modified clusters \nas compared with the Detroit Board's clusters. In any event the desegregation panel, based on its \ninvestigation of all aspects of pupil assignment, remains free to suggest a modification of these \nclusters in order to reduce the time and number of children requiring transportation. \n38. With that caveat, the court finds that plaintiffs' modification of the Detroit Board's clusters \nprovides a workable, practicable, and sound framework for the design of a plan to desegregate the \nDetroit public schools. \nC. Pupil Assignment and Transportation \n39. Example of various methods of pupil assignment to accomplish desegregation have been \nbrought to the attention of the court by the parties: pairing, grouping, and clustering of schools; \nvarious strip, skip, island, and non-contiguous zoning; various lotteries based on combinations of \npresent school assignment, geographic location, name, or birthday. Judicious use of these \ntechniques —coupled with reasonable staggering of school hours and maximizing use of existing \ntransportation facilities— can lead to maximum actual desegregation with a minimum of additional \ntransportation. \n40. Quite apart from desegregation, under any circumstances, transportation for secondary pupils \nliving more than 1½ miles, and elementary pupils living more than one mile from school, is often \ndemanded by parents and should be provided. Moreover, it is essential to the effectiveness of any \ndesegregation plan that transportation be provided free to all students requiring it under that criteria. \n(Brewer v. Norfolk Board of Education, 456 F.2d 943 (April 1972) (4th ucation, 456 F.2d 943 (4th Cir. \n1972). \n41. In the recent past more than 300,000 pupils in the tri-county area regularly rode to school on \nsome type of bus; this figure excludes the countless children who arrive at school in car pools, which \nare many, many times more dangerous than riding on the school bus. \n42. Throughout the state approximately 35-40% of all students arrive at school on a bus. In school \ndistricts eligible for state reimbursement of transportation costs in the three affected counties, the \npercent of pupils transported in 1969-70 ranged from 42 to 52%. \n43. In comparison approximately 40%, or 310,000, of the 780,000 children within the desegregation \narea will require transportation in order to accomplish maximum actual desegregation. \n44. Hence, any increase in the numbers of pupils to be transported upon implementation of a \ncomplete desegregation plan over the number presently 930*930 transported, relative to the state \nand the tri-county area, should be minimal. Indeed, any increase may only reflect the greater \nnumbers of pupils who would be transported in any event but for the state practice, which affected \nthe segregation found in this case, and which denies state reimbursement to students and districts \nwholly within city limits regardless of the distance of the child from the school to which \nassigned.[16] (Ruling on Issue of Segregation at 14.) The greatest change is the direction of the \nbuses. \n45. There is uncontradicted evidence that the actual cost of transportation for a two-way plan of \ndesegregation should be no greater than 50 to 60 dollars per pupil transported,[17] comparable to the \npresent costs per pupil through the state. Increases in the total costs of pupil transportation in the \n\ndesegregation area, therefore, will result primarily from providing all children requiring transportation \na free ride instead of imposing the costs of transportation for many on the families in districts which \nare ineligible for state reimbursement and which fail to provide transportation. \n46. By multiple use of buses, careful routing, and economies of scale resulting from a \ncomprehensive system of pupil transportation, it may be possible to achieve savings in per pupil \ncosts. For example in 1969-1970 many school districts in the tri-county area which used the same \nbus for even two loads per day lowered their per pupil costs to $40 or less. In a coordinated, urban \npupil transportation system it may be possible to raise the bus use factor to three or more. (See \n\"First Report\" State Survey and Evaluation.) \n47. In the tri-county area in the recent past there were approximately 1,800 buses (and another 100 \nsmaller vans) used for the transportation of pupils. Assuming a rough average of 50 pupils per bus \ncarrying three loads of students per day, this transportation fleet may prove sufficient to carry some \n270,000 pupils. \n48. Various public transit authorities now transport an additional 60,000 pupils on their regular public \nruns. \n49. The degree to which these plausible bus-use factors can be realized to their maximum, and \nwhether these public transit facilities may be fully utilized in a plan of desegregation, must be \nanswered upon careful investigation by a panel of experts. \n50. There is no disagreement among the parties, and the court so finds, that additional \ntransportation facilities, at least to the number of 350 buses, will have to be purchased to meet the \nincrease in the number of students who should be provided transportation for either an interim or \nfinal plan of desegregation. \n51. For all the reasons stated heretofore —including time, distance, and transportation factors—\ndesegregation within the area described is physically easier and more practicable and feasible, than \ndesegregation efforts limited to the corporate geographic limits of the city of Detroit. \n52. The issue of transportation of kindergarten children, and their inclusion in part or in full in the \ndesegregation 931*931 plan, may require further study. There was general agreement among the \nexperts who testified that kindergarten, but for \"political\" considerations, should be included, if \npracticable, in the desegregation plan. Kindergarten, however, is generally a half-day program. \nTransportation of kindergarten children for upwards of 45 minutes, one-way, does not appear \nunreasonable, harmful, or unsafe in any way. In the absence of some compelling justification, which \ndoes not yet appear, kindergarten children should be included in the final plan of desegregation. \n53. Every effort should be made to insure that transportation and reassignment of students to \naccomplish desegregation is \"two-way\" and falls as fairly as possible on both races. Although the \nnumber of black and white children transported and reassigned at the outset will be roughly equal, it \nis inevitable that a larger proportion of black children will be transported for a greater proportion of \ntheir school years than white children, if transportation overall is to be minimized. To mitigate this \ndisproportion, every effort should be made at the outset to randomize the location of particular grade \ncenters. In the short term, full utilization of vastly under-capacity inner-city schools may also help to \nmitigate the disproportion for some black children; and in the long term, new school capacity, \nconsistent with other constitutional commands and the overall needs of the desegregation area and \nthe surrounding area, should be added in Detroit, in relative proximity to concentrations of black \nstudent residence. \n\nD. Restructuring of Facilities and Reassignment of \nTeachers \n54. In the reassignment of pupils to accomplish desegregation the court finds that facilities must be \nsubstantially real-located and faculty substantially reassigned by reason of the clustering, pairing \nand grouping of schools. \n55. In order to make the pupil desegregation process fully effective the court finds that it is essential \nto integrate faculty and staff and to insure that black faculty and staff representation at every school \nis more than token. The court has previously found and reaffirms that \"a quota or racial balance in \neach school which is equivalent to the system-wide ratio and without more\" is educationally \nunsound, and that the desideratum is the balance of staff by qualifications for subject and grade \nlevel, and then by race, experience and sex. It is obvious, given the racial composition of the faculty \nand staff in the schools in the metropolitan plan area, and the adjusted racial composition of the \nstudents, that vacancies and increases and reductions in faculty and staff cannot effectively achieve \nthe needed racial balance in this area of the school operation. Active steps must be taken to even \nout the distribution of black teachers and staff throughout the system. \n56. In the desegregation area approximately 16% of the faculty and 12% of the principals and \nassistant principals are black. In this context \"token\" means roughly less than 10% black. Moreover, \nwhere there is more than one building administrator in any school, a bi-racial administrative team is \nrequired wherever possible. \n57. Every effort should be made to hire and promote, and to increase such on-going efforts as there \nmay be to hire and promote, additional black faculty and staff. Because of the systematic and \nsubstantial under-employment of black administrators and teachers in the tri-county area, an \naffirmative program for black employment should be developed and implemented. \n58. The rated capacity of classrooms in the Detroit public schools is 32; in some of the suburban \ndistricts the average rated capacity is as low as 24 or 25. Utilization should be redetermined on a \nuniform basis. \n59. In respect to faculty and staff, school facilities, and the utilization of existing school capacity, \nnormal administrative practice in handling the substantial reallocation and reassignment \nincident 932*932 to pupil desegregation should produce schools substantially alike. \n60. In the circumstances of this case, the pairing, grouping and clustering of schools to accomplish \ndesegregation with minimum transportation often requires use of grade arrangements such as K-4, \nK-5, or even K-6. In so planning pupil reassignments, it is sometimes necessary, and often \nadministratively practicable, to include grades K-8 or even K-9 to achieve the maximum actual \ndesegregation with the minimum transportation. Grade structures in most elementary schools in the \ndesegregation area is a basic K-6; however, almost all other combinations are found. They differ \nwithin and among various districts. \n61. In the reassignments of pupils and teachers and the reallocation of equipment and facilities \nrequired to accomplish desegregation, the elementary grades and schools present relatively few \nadministrative difficulties, while the high school grades and facilities present the greater difficulties, \nparticularly with respect to scheduling and curriculum. \n\n62. For these reasons, if it develops that interim choices must be made because of the impossibility \nof immediate desegregation of all grades, schools, and clusters in the desegregation area, the \nweight of the evidence is, and the court so finds, that desegregation should begin first at the earliest \ngrades for entire elementary school groupings throughout as many clusters as possible. \nE. School Construction \n63. Relative to suburban districts the Detroit public schools, as a whole, are considerably over-\ncapacity. (See also Finding 58, supra.) To alleviate this overcrowding, equalize rated capacity and \nminimize and equalize transportation burdens borne by black pupils in the city, needed new school \ncapacity, consistent with other requirements of a desegregation plan, should be added on a priority \nbasis in the city of Detroit. \n64. Relevant to the court's choice of a desegregation area more limited than the Detroit Board \nProposal is the testimony, elicited on cross-examination from two of the primary authors of that \nproposal, related to the effects of controlling new school construction. The broader area in the \nDetroit proposal was chosen without any real consideration of the impact of controlling school \nconstruction in an area larger than the desegregation area. Upon reflection, both Dr. Flynn and Mr. \nHenrickson admitted that closely scrutinizing and limiting the addition of capacity to areas outside \nthe desegregation area might lead them to re-evaluate the need, in the context of maintaining now \nand hereafter a unitary system, to include an area as sweeping as recommended by the Detroit \nBoard Proposal. \n65. In our Ruling on Issue of Segregation, pp. 8-10, this court found that the \"residential segregation \nthroughout the larger metropolitan area is substantial, pervasive and of long standing\" and that \n\"governmental actions and inaction at all levels, Federal, State and local, have combined with those \nof private organizations, such as loaning institutions and real estate associations and brokerage \nfirms, to establish and to maintain the pattern of residential segregation through the Detroit \nmetropolitan area.\" We also noted that this deliberate setting of residential patterns had an important \neffect not only on the racial composition of inner-city schools but the entire School District of the City \nof Detroit. (Ruling on Issue of Segregation at 3-10.) Just as evident is the fact that suburban school \ndistricts in the main contain virtually all-white schools. The white population of the city declined and \nin the suburbs grew; the black population in the city grew, and largely, was contained therein by \nforce of public and private racial discrimination at all levels. \n66. We also noted the important interaction of school and residential segregation: \"Just as there is \nan interaction between residential patterns and the racial composition of the schools, so there is a \ncorresponding effect on the residential 933*933 pattern by the racial composition of schools.\" Ruling \non Issue of Segregation at 10. Cf. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 402 U.S. 1, 20-21, 91 S.Ct. \n1267, 1278, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); \"People gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are \nlocated in response to the needs of people. The location of schools may thus influence the patterns \nof residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of \ninner-city neighborhoods.\" \n67. Within the context of the segregatory housing market, it is obvious that the white families who left \nthe city schools would not be as likely to leave in the absence of schools, not to mention white \nschools, to attract, or at least serve, their children.[18]Immigrating families were affected in their \nschool and housing choices in a similar manner. Between 1950 and 1969 in the tri-county area, \napproximately 13,900 \"regular classrooms,\" capable of serving and attracting over 400,000 \npupils,[19] were added in school districts which were less than 2% black in their pupil racial \ncomposition in the 1970-71 school year. (P.M. 14; P.M. 15). \n\n68. The precise effect of this massive school construction on the racial composition of Detroit area \npublic schools cannot be measured. It is clear, however, that the effect has been \nsubstantial.[20] Unfortunately, the State, despite its awareness of the important impact of school \nconstruction and announced policy to control it, acted \"in keeping generally, with the discriminatory \npractices which advanced or perpetuated racial segregation in these schools.\" Ruling on Issue of \nSegregation at 15; see also id., at 13. \n69. In addition to the interim re-evaluation of new school construction required in the order, pursuant \nto the State Board's own requirements, the final plan will consider other appropriate provisions for \nfuture construction throughout the metropolitan area. \nF. Governance, Finance and Administrative \nArrangements \n70. The plans submitted by the State Board, the Detroit Board, and the intervening defendants \nMagdowski, et al., discuss generally possible governance, finance, and administrative \narrangements[21] 934*934 which may be appropriate for operation of an interim or final plan of \ndesegregation. Without parsing in detail the interesting, and sometimes sensible, concepts \nintroduced by each plan, it is sufficient to note that each contemplates overlaying some broad \neducational authority over the area, creating or using some regional arrangement (with continued \nuse or eventual redrawing of existing districts), and considerable input at the individual school level. \nThe court has made no decision in this regard and will consider the matter at a subsequent hearing. \n71. Each concept needs to be \"fleshed-out\" in the hard prospect of implementation of a final plan of \ndesegregation and what is necessary and essential, and only that, for the successful operation of \nthat plan of school desegregation now on an interim basis and hereafter on a permanent footing. \n72. There are now some 86 school districts in the tri-county area of varying size, numbers of pupils, \nshapes, and wealth. \n73. In another context, the State Board of Education found each related to a \"metropolitan core city\" \n(Detroit) as \"city,\" \"town,\" or \"urban fringe\" districts. \n74. The boundaries of these school districts in general bear no relationship to other municipal, \ncounty, or special district governments, needs or services.[22] \n935*935 75. Some educational services are already provided to students on an inter-district, county, \nintercounty, or metropolitan basis; and many support services are provided by the intermediate \nschool districts and the State Department of Education. For various reasons many pupils already \ncross school district lines to attend school or receive educational services.[23] \n76. In many respects—patterns of economic life, work, play, population, planning, transportation, \nhealth services —the tri-county area constitutes a rough series of interrelated communities \nconstituting, in the view of the United States Census Bureau, a single standard metropolitan \nstatistical area. \n77. Local units of government in the metropolitan area have in many instances joined together for \nthe purpose of providing better solutions to problems confronting them. In such instances various \nunits of government have either disregarded local boundaries or have concluded that the problems \nwere such as to call for a metropolitan solution. In some cases they have created overlay \n\norganizations. SEMCOG, recreational authorities, a metropolitan sewage system, SEMTA, and the \nDetroit Water System are examples of these metropolitan approaches. \n78. Indeed, the State defendants at this very moment are attempting in state court to strike down \none irrationality, and the discriminatory effect, of the existing school district arrangement, i. \ne., finance, apparently in the hope of moving to a virtual state-wide assumption of costs. \n79. In such circumstances there has been no showing that the existing school district boundaries are \nrationally related to any legitimate purpose; and the court finds that the particular welter of existing \nboundaries for 86 school districts is not necessary to the promotion of any compelling state interest. \n80. On the basis of the present record, the court is of the view that the shifts in faculty, staff, \nresources and equipment and the exchanges of pupils necessary to accomplish maximum actual \ndesegregation may be made, at least on an interim basis, by contractual agreements or otherwise \namong and between the existing school districts. The court has serious reservations, however, \nwhether such procedures will inevitably threaten the continuing effectiveness of a plan of \ndesegregation over the long-term. On these issues more evidence and further hearings will be \nnecessary before reaching a final decision. \n81. The State defendants, and in particular the State Board of Education which is charged with the \nprimary responsibility for public education in Michigan, are the primary parties to be charged with \nresponsibility to undertake that vital inquiry and return with recommendations about those \ngovernance, financial, and administrative arrangements which are necessary and essential to the \nsuccessful implementation of a plan of desegregation on an interim and continuing basis. \nG. Involvement of Affected Persons and Communities \nand Protection Against Racial Discrimination in the \nDesegregation Process \n82. The court has received uncontroverted evidence in the plans filed by every party and in \ntestimony, and advice in several briefs amicus curiae, and the court finds, that the following \nadditional factors are essential to implementation and operation of an effective plan of desegregation \nin the circumstances of this case: \n(a) Bi-racial councils made up of the parents and staff, and, where appropriate, pupils, should be set \nup at each school; the persons most affected must be encouraged and given every opportunity to \nparticipate 936*936 in the implementation of desegregation. \n(b) Curriculum content, and all curriculum materials and student codes, must be re-evaluated and \nreflect the diversity of ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the children now in the schools. As far as \npossible, those immediately affected by these decisions at the individual school level should \nparticipate in that process. \n(c) In-service training for faculty and staff for multi-ethnic studies and human relations should be \nrequired; we must, after all, rely primarily on our teachers and children to respect, nurture, and deal \nwith the diversity of students present in the desegregated school. \n(d) The entire grading, reporting, counselling, and testing program should be reviewed in light of \ndesegregated schools compared to traditional schools and to avoid imposing the effects of past \ndiscrimination on the children. Tracking, whether so labeled or by any test, which has racial effects \nshould not be utilized; within schools a pattern of classes which are substantially disproportionate in \ntheir racial composition from the relevant school or grade mix should be closely scrutinized and \nmaintained only if necessary to promote a compelling educational objective. \n\n83. In making the finding above, we remind the parties that this court's task is to enforce \nconstitutional rights not to act as a schoolmaster; the court's task is to protect the constitutional rights \nhere found violated with as little intrusion into the education process as possible. The court's \nobjective is to establish the minimum constitutional framework within which the system of public \nschools may operate now and hereafter in a racially unified, non-discriminatory fashion. Within that \nframework the body politic, educators, parents, and most particularly the children must be given the \nmaximum opportunity to experiment and secure a high quality, and equal, educational opportunity. \nHowever, experience has proven that specific goals, deadlines and methods of reporting and review \nmust be required in all desegregation cases to insure compliance. \nH. Timing \n84. The burden remains with State defendants to show why desegregation for all schools, grades, \nclassrooms, and pupils in the desegregation area should not proceed now, i. e., in the context of this \nlitigation, for the 1972 fall term. The design and implementation of desegregation plans for all grades \nin 15 clusters —including pupil assignments, necessary reassignment of faculty and restructuring of \nfacilities, planning and acquiring the needed transportation facilities —is conceded by all parties to \nbe a major undertaking. Yet next fall will already be a full year, not just four or six or even eight \nweeks, Cf. Carter v. West Feliciano Parish School Bd., 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 \n(1970), after the initial ruling by this court of the need for maximum feasible desegregation \"now.\" In \nsuch circumstances the burden to prove the infeasibility of implementation of complete relief is high. \n85. The desegregation panel, therefore, must make every effort to plan to implement as much actual \ndesegregation, for as many clusters, schools, grades, classrooms, and students as possible. \n86. At a minimum, there is agreement among, and evidence from, the experts that desegregating \nseveral grades, and more particularly entire elementary schools, within many, if not all clusters, may \nbe accomplished in the fall. \n87. In view of Findings 60 to 62, supra, if hard choices must be made for the fall, any interim plan \nshould attempt to desegregate grades K-6, K-8, or K-9 in as many entire clusters as possible; and, in \nthe absence of some other showing, there appears no reason why a complete 937*937 plan may not \nbe implemented by fall 1973.[24] \n88. A heavy burden rests with those who seek delay in any way, shape, kind, degree or extent to \nconvince the court that maximum actual desegregation cannot proceed effectively forthwith. \n89. In view of the time constraints, the need to discharge this burden forthwith, the State defendants' \ndefault in assisting this court to determine the appropriate desegregation area, and the State \ndefendants' asserted and evident lack of available planning capacity suited to the task, the court \nfinds that some additional entity must be charged with the task of preparing a pupil assignment plan \nto accomplish maximum actual desegregation and a transportation plan within the framework this \nday established. To that end a panel of skilled experts, broadly representative of the parties and their \ninterests, appointed by the court and assigned that task, is required to discharge effectively and \npromptly these two tasks. \n90. State defendants remain charged with the duty, however, of coming forward with other \nnecessary reports and plans concerning those governance, administrative, and financial \narrangements necessary and essential to the implementation of an effective plan of desegregation \non an interim and on-going basis. \n\nI. The Plan \n91. Based on the entire evidence amassed in this case, the court finds that an educationally sound, \nadministratively feasible, constitutionally adequate, practicable and effective plan of desegregation \nmay be developed, implemented and operated hereafter for the desegregation area as set forth in \nfindings 1-90 above. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1. The court has continuing jurisdiction of this action for all purposes, including the granting of \neffective relief. Bradley v. Milliken, Ruling on Issue of Segregation, September 27, 1971; Findings of \nFact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-Only Plans of Desegregation, March 28, 1972. \n2. A de jure segregation violation having been found, the minimum remedy is maximum actual \ndesegregation, taking into account the practicalities of the situation.[25] Bradley v. Milliken, Oral \nOrder, October 4, 1971; Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-Only Plans of \nDesegregation, March 28, 1972; Brown v.

The remedial obligation rests with school authorities; but where in any way they fail, or \nare unable because of the circumstances of the case, to fulfill any part of the obligation promptly and \nfully, the court has broad equity power, and the duty, to insure that demonstrable progress be made \nnow; that a schedule for planning be adopted forthwith; and that necessary planning be specifically \nordered and immediately undertaken in order that a constitutionally adequate plan may be fashioned \nand finally ordered implemented as soon as possible. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of \nEducation, 311 F.Supp. 265 (W.D.N.C.1970), aff'd, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed.2d 554 \n(1971); Carter v.

Only then will the court in this case be apprised fully of the practicalities of \nthe situation, and what is reasonable and feasible, in order that a final order may issue. School \nauthorities, of course, will be given an opportunity to (1) raise relevant objections, (2) make \nsuggestions for modifications, (3) or present an alternative plan of desegregation; and their judgment \nand expertise will be considered and given appropriate weight by the court. \n4. Funds must either be raised or reallocated, where necessary, to remedy the deprivation of \nplaintiffs' constitutional rights and to insure that no such unconstitutional neglect recurs \nagain.

It would be a cruel mockery of constitutional law if a different rule were \nto be applied to school desegregation cases. After all schooling is this nation's biggest industry and \nthe most important task of government left to the states by the Constitution. In this case, were a \ndifferent rule to be applied, it would constitute a gigantic hypocrisy: After all the money which has \nbeen spent over the years creating and maintaining the segregated condition, the relatively small \namounts of money required to undo that segregation can be found. The law, surely, requires at least \nthat. And the application of the commands of Swanndoes require that in almost every school \ndesegregation case which has been brought to this court's attention. \n5. In the substantial reassignment of faculty and restructuring of facilities required by the clustering, \npairing, and grouping of schools to accomplish pupil desegregation, normal administrative practice \nshould lead to schools with substantially like facilities, faculty and staff, and equipment. Swann, \nsupra, 402 U.S. at 18-20, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. Moreover, special care should be taken in \nthe necessary reassignment of faculty to avoid creating or maintaining the racial identification of \nschools \"simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staff.\" Swann, supra, 402 U.S. \nat 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277. In any event, the equitable discretion of the court is broad 939*939 enough to \ninsure that those aspects of faculty desegregation and equalization of facilities which are essential to \nthe effective operation of a desegregation plan are included in the planning and final order, Swann, \nsupra, 402 U.S. at 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554; U. S. v. Montgomery County Board of Ed., \n395 U.S. 225, 89 S.Ct. 1670, 23 L.Ed.2d 263 (1969); Hecht v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 \nS.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944); and no contract, union agreement or otherwise, or Board policy or \npractice may impede these Fourteenth Amendment obligations. U. S. v. Greenwood Municipal \nSeparate School District, 406 F.2d 1086, 1094 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 907, 89 S.Ct. \n1749, 23 L.Ed.2d 220 (1969); Berry v. Benton Harbor, (W.D.Mich.1971). \n6. The Federal courts have repeatedly rejected plans exempting the lower grades from integration, \nrelying less on educational data than upon the hard legal fact that segregation at any age is a denial \nof the equal protection of the law. See, e. g., United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 372 \nF.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), aff'd on rehearing en banc, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967). To leave grades K \nthrough 3 exempt from a desegregation plan is not to eliminate segregation \"root and branch.\" Green \nv. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed. 2d 716 (1968). \n7. The consistent application of settled constitutional law invests this court with the equitable power, \nand the duty, to order preparation, and thereafter implementation, of a practicable and sound plan \nwhich embodies the principles set forth in these findings and conclusions and the attached \nmemorandum and order. See, generally, Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy \nto Accomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools of the City of Detroit, March 24, 1972; Findings \nof Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-Only Plans, March 24, 1972; oral ruling on offers of proof, \nApril 13, 1972; and the cases cited therein. \n8. School construction practices throughout the metropolitan area have added to and reinforced the \npattern of segregation referred to. Although there were vacant seats throughout the city to which \nstudents could have been assigned at lesser cost and with the achievement of integration, continued \nsums were expended for construction of new schools designed to service particular areas of racial \nconcentration, and such schools opened as and have continued to be racially identifiable in violation \nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 18-20, 91 \nS.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); United States v. School Dist. 151, 404 F.2d 1125, 1132-33 (7th \nCir. 1968); Davis v. School Dist. of Pontiac, 309 F.Supp. 734, 741-42 (E.D. Mich.1970), aff'd, 443 \nF.2d 573 (6th Cir. 1971); Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ., 311 F.Supp. 501, 517-18 (C.D. \nCalif.1970); Johnson v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 339 F.Supp. 1315, 1325 \n(N.D.Calif.1971) (Appendix A, Memorandum and Order Requiring the Parties to File Plans for \n\nSchool Desegregation, April 28, 1971); Brewer v. School Board of the City of Norfolk, 397 F.2d 37, \n42 (4th Cir. 1968); Cf. Sloan v. Tenth School Dist. of Wilson County, 433 F.2d 587 (6th Cir. 1970); \nUnited States v. Board of Educ. of Polk County, (4th Cir. 1968); Kelley v. Altheimer, 378 F.2d 483 \n(8th Cir. 1967); Bradley v. School Bd., 325 F.Supp. 828 (E.D.Va. 1971); Clark v. Board of Educ. of \nLittle Rock, 401 U.S. 971, 91 S.Ct. 1187, 28 L. Ed.2d 321 (1971). \n9. The legal effects of racially discriminatory confinement to a school district are not different from \nthe effects of such containment within a district. E. g., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 \nF.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1971); Haney v. County Board Sevier, 410 F.2d 920 (8th Cir. 1969), 429 F.2d 364 \n(8th Cir. 1970). \n10. Where the actions of state defendants and local school authorities throughout the metropolitan \narea have had the natural, foreseeable, and 940*940 actual effect of building upon, taking advantage \nof, and encouraging racially segregated demographic patterns deliberately fixed by governmental \naction at all levels with the effect of creating and maintaining racial segregation in the public schools, \nthere is a present obligation to eliminate the continuing effects of such violation; and the District \nCourt has the duty, upon default by school authorities, to intervene to secure compliance with the \nConstitution pursuant to the sound exercise of traditional equity powers consistent with the \npracticalities of the local situation. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 402 U. S. 1, 15-16, 20-21, 31-\n32, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Cf. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit-\nOnly Plans of Desegregation, p. 5, Conclusion 4. In devising remedies where state-imposed \nsegregation has been established, it is the responsibility of school authorities and district courts to \nsee to it that future school construction and abandonment is not used and does not serve to \nperpetuate or re-establish the violation. Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d \n554. \n11. Moreover, where the State, and named defendants, are substantially implicated in the \nsegregation violation found and are ultimately responsible for public schooling throughout the state, \nthe consistent application of constitutional principles requires that this court take all steps necessary \nand essential to require them to desegregate the Detroit public schools effectively and maintain, now \nand hereafter, a racially unified, non-discriminatory system in the absence of a showing that the \njudicial intervention here contemplated will frustrate the promotion of a legitimate and compelling \nstate policy or interest.

Board of Commissioners, 391 U.S. 450, 459, 88 S.Ct. 1700, 20 L.Ed.2d 733 \n(1968). \n[*] By a subsequent order of the court, entered June 29, 1972, two additional panel members were named: Mary Ellen \nRiordan, President, Detroit Federation of Teachers; and a designee of the Michigan Education Association (MEA), who was \nlater identified as Melvin Leasure. \n[**] The designees of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and newly intervening defendants shall be \ncommunicated to the court within seven days of the entry of this order. In the event the newly intervening defendants cannot \nagree upon a designee, they may each submit a nominee within seven days from the entry of this order, and the court shall \nselect one of the nominees as representative of said defendants. \n\nThe designee of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction was later identified as Dr. William Pierce, Deputy \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, and the designee later agreed upon by the newly intervening defendants was Dr. \nWilliam Emerson, Superintendent of Oakland Schools. \n[1] In the main such proof entirely misses the point: the violation here found has to do with school segregation caused in \nsubstantial part by force of public authority and action; yet the intervening defendants' questions and offer of proof speak \nmainly to educational theory and recent and sometimes contradictory research about narrowly measured educational \neffects, mostly on achievement test scores, of quite limited beginnings of racial, or socio-economic integration of various \ntypes and as compared with the effects of dollar or other resource inputs and continued segregation. This court does not \nunderstand, however, that such research, from the Coleman report to its many reanalyses, formed the primary bases for the \nBrown decision or any of its progeny. See, e. g., Brunson v. Bd. of Trustees, 429 F.2d 820, 826 (4th Cir. 1970) (J. Sobeloff, \nconcurring). In a context similar to newly intervening defendants' objections to desegregation, the Supreme Court in Swann \nspecifically held that such factors constitute an impermissible limit upon the duty to desegregate. 402 U.S. at 24, Fn. 8. \nCitation to such research, either in support or rejection of school desegregation, misses the primary point: insofar as pupil \nassignments are concerned, the system of public schooling in every state must be operated in a racially non-discriminatory, \nunified fashion; until that objective is met, the very system of public schooling constitutes an invidious racial classification. \nThe adoption of an education theory having the effect of maintaining a pattern of de jure segregation is therefore clearly \nimpermissible. (Whether such theories, research, or evidence on educational quality or inequality form the basis for requiring \njudicial intervention and relief in the absence of a finding of de jure segregation is a question this court need not face.) \nIn any event, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, on June 19, 1970, that greater, not less, desegregation is the \nproper manner to alleviate the problem of disparity in achievement. Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, Jackson, Tenn., \n427 F.2d 1005, 1008 (6th Cir. 1970). \n[2] Chief Justice Burger in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 6, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. \n[3] Defendant(s) Magdowski, et al., originally opposed to desegregation, during the course of the taking of proofs on the \nissue of segregation, conceded that the public schools of the city of Detroit were in fact segregated, and took the early lead \nin suggesting that the only effective avenue for desegregation was a metropolitan plan. The Detroit Board of Education, \nwhile continuing to deny that it has been guilty of any act of segregation, took the position that if desegregation were to be \nundertaken it could be done only on a metropolitan basis. So that now the white parents of the city of Detroit and its Board of \nEducation—the parties most directly involved with the lot of the students in the Detroit school system—see no alternative to, \nand, for all practical purposes seek a metropolitan solution to the basic Detroit school problem. \n[4] In the context of this hearing, the defendant Detroit Board of Education is not in a position to act as the usual \"school \nauthority\" primarily responsible for suggesting an appropriate desegregation area simply because its authority does not \nextend beyond the geographic limits of the city of Detroit. The competence, knowledge of local conditions, and expertise of \nthose schoolmen who helped prepare the Detroit Board's proposal, however, may be utilized and given appropriate weight. \n[5] In Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, #K88-71, Judge Fox pointed out the primary responsibility of the state: \"The \nState of Michigan is represented by two entities, but the entity is an agent of the State . . . [T]he Constitution says something \nabout your [the State's] responsibility.\" The court went on to order the State to take an active role. Pre-trial order and \ntranscript, May 1, 1972. \n[6] The Detroit Board plan places heavier reliance on white flight and socio-economic factors, while the Magdowski proposal \nin addition places an emphasis on maintaining a minimum percentage black in each school. These considerations in no way \ndetermine the court's choice of a desegregation area necessary to meet constitutional requirements. In fairness, however, it \nalso should be noted that the desegregation area, which the court deems to best meet constitutional requirements, also \nhappens in the main, to meet the other concerns expressed in these two proposals. That the Board's interest in socio-\neconomic integration is largely met by racial desegregation is not surprising. There is uncontroverted evidence in the record, \nand the court so finds, that there is a high correlation between blacks and persons of a low socio-economic status, the \nresult, in the main, of the cumulative effects of past and present racial discrimination including discrimination in education. At \nsome point hereafter, of course, school authorities with responsibility for implementation and operation of the racially-unified \nnon-discriminatory school system contemplated, or parts thereof, may and should include in its plan other educational goals \nand needs whether or not they are required by the law or any court. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 \nS.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. \n[7] If a state is constitutionally forbidden to institute a system of racial segregation by the use of artificial boundary lines, it is \nlikewise forbidden to perpetuate a system whose effect is to maintain segregation. \"There is no legally protected vested \ninterest in segregation. If there were, then Brown v. Board of Education and the numerous decisions based on that case \nwould be pointless. Courts will not say in one breath that public school systems may not practice segregation, and in the \nnext that they may do nothing to eliminate it.\" Wanner v. School Bd. of Arlington County, 357 F.2d 452, (Sobeloff, Cir. \n\nJ.), pp. 454 and 455. The historic fact is that existing conditions are based on a design to segregate the races. To hold that \nsegregation, once accomplished, is sacrosanct and beyond constitutional reach, is to say that the United States Constitution \nand its Amendments, and their provisions for equality, are mere rhetoric. \n[8] See Findings 70-78, infra. \n[9] The interplay of these two factors summarizes two other guideposts or starting points: maximum feasible desegregation \nand eliminating racially identifiable schools. Factors such as time and distance limitations, together with the rough definitions \nof substantial disproportion with the relevant school community's pupil racial composition, in turn largely determine the \nmeaning of \"eliminating racially identifiable schools\" and what constitutes \"maximum feasible desegregation,\" in the \nparticular circumstances here present and in the context of a prior finding of segregation. \n[10] The Detroit Board Proposal contemplates desegregation on a \"minority\"-white basis. The proof in this cause, however, \nhas been aimed at the segregation of black children and white children; similarly the remedy has been so defined, argued, \nand in the main presented by parties. The court finds, therefore, that the area, and further planning, should, in the main, be \nconfined to a black-white breakdown. \n[11] To the Southwest, Plaintiffs' Proposal falls on the side of less time in transit than the 40-minute guideline because \ninclusion of more area is not required to desegregate. (See Finding 27, infra.) \n[12] Moreover, in the main, the areas, schools, and pupils in these districts are not as fully members of the greater Detroit \nschool community: many are less urban; they are the furthest in terms of time, distance, and contact from the Detroit area's \neconomic and social activities; and many are more oriented, if anything, to urban areas other than Detroit, for example, the \nAnn Arbor—Ypsilanti area. \n[13] The court notes, however, that the range of average socio-economic status for the various regions or clusters in \nPlaintiffs' Proposal is similar to that in the Detroit Board Proposal: based on the Michigan Assessment the range in Plaintiffs' \nProposal happens to be 44.7 to 53.7, while in the Detroit Board Proposal the range is 46.3 to 53; and only three of the 15 \nclusters of schools in Plaintiffs' Proposal fall below 46.3. \n[14] Because of the closeness of the question, particularly as it relates to any problems which may arise hereafter in \nestablishing a pupil desegregation plan, the court feels that some opportunity should be given to the expert panel to suggest \na modification of this tentative resolution. See also Findings 34-38 below. \n[15] A common practice in other cases is the use of \"pupil locator\" maps. See North-cross v. School Board of City of \nMemphis, 444 F.2d 1184 (6th Cir. 1971). \n[16] For years these city-contained school districts, which include some suburban districts in the desegregation area, as well \nas the Detroit Public Schools, have demanded without success that this inequitable state practice be changed so that all \ndistricts could be reimbursed on the same basis for pupil transportation. \n[17] The figure almost twice that which appears in several of the State \"plans\" was based on the assumption that busing \nwould be \"one-way\" with black children being assigned to suburban schools. Mr. Wagner, the state official in charge of pupil \ntransportation, provided the information on which that estimate was based and also informed his superiors that a two-way \nplan of desegregation and transportation would cost much less per pupil. The State defendants did not bring this important \nfact to the court's attention in any of their submissions; it was uncovered and fully explored in the deposition of Mr. Wagner \ntaken by plaintiffs. \n[18] This phenomenon was noted in Swann, 402 U.S. 1, 20-21. The principle was long known, and actively, supported by \nthe F.H.A. For example, consider that public agency's early understanding in its 1936 manual that white subdivision \ndevelopments require white schools: \"if the children of people living in such area are compelled to attend school where the \nmajority or a good number of the pupils represent a far lower level of society or an incompatible racial element, the \nneighborhood under consideration will prove far less stable and desirable than if the condition did not exist.\" \n[19] This figure assumes 30 children/regular classroom. Although rated capacities may be lower, the figure for regular \nclassrooms does not include several types of instructional, recreational, laboratory, and other rooms which add overall pupil \ncapacity to schools. \n[20] The resulting pattern is unmistakable: \"Residential segregation within the city and throughout the larger metropolitan \narea is substantial, pervasive and of long standing. Black citizens are located in separate and distinct areas within the city \n\nand are not generally found in the suburbs. While the racially unrestricted choice of black persons and economic factors may \nhave played some part in the development of this pattern of residential segregation, it is, in the main, the result of past and \npresent practices and customs of racial discrimination, both public and private, which have and does restrict the housing \nopportunities of black people. Perhaps the most that can be said is that all of them [various governmental units], including \nschool authorities, are, in part, responsible for the segregated condition which exists.\" Ruling on Issue of Segregation, 8 and \n10. Moreover, an examination of PX 181, 192 and 185 shows that black children often remain isolated in predominately \nblack schools in the few suburban school districts with any numbers of black pupils. In the last several weeks the local press \nhas reported that the United States Office of Education cut off funds for one such district. \n[21] Included in this set of arrangements are contract relationships of various types concerning personnel, property and \ndebts. \n[22] The defendant, William G. Milliken, Governor of the State of Michigan, in his amicus brief filed in the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, San Antonio Independent School District v. Demetrio P. Rodriguez, 406 U.S. 966, 92 S.Ct. 2413, 32 \nL.Ed.2d 665, says, page II: \n\"1. Amici, whose individual and particular interests are set forth in more detail below, are the Governors of the above-listed \nStates. As Governors and chief executive officers of their respective States, Amici are responsible for upholding and \ncarrying out the commands of the Constitutions and laws of their various States, including the provisions thereof requiring \nthe establishment of public schools and school districts and commanding the children of their States to attend school. Amici \nare responsible for financial decisions affecting all State operations, including those pertaining to support and financing of \nthe public schools. \n\"Amici are deeply concerned about the ongoing and continuing crisis in public education and the difficulties facing public \neducational systems in their States and around the nation. Amici recognize that grave inequities exist because of variation in \nlocal property tax bases upon which local school districts must rely in order to support their school systems. Amici believe \nthat these inequalities in educational resources violate the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and that these inequalities must be eliminated * * * *\" \nThe Governors' amicus brief, speaking of the State of Texas, could as well be said of the State of Michigan, when it used \nthese words: \n\"It is also undisputed that the local school districts and their boundaries, and hence the aggregate value of the property they \ncontain, are entirely the creation of and their maintenance is the responsibility of the State of Texas. Furthermore, the \ndetailed regulation of public education financing in Texas * * * is a state not a local responsibility. Indeed, the school districts \nhave the power to raise funds for education only as a result of delegation by the State of its own power to tax for the general \nwelfare.\" (Page 8 of brief.) \n\"Since the State could not discriminate directly against students residing in poorer localities, it should not be permitted to \naccomplish the same result by dividing its responsibility for equal education with local school districts and failing to \nsupplement the funds raised by the school districts sufficiently to eliminate discrimination.\"* (Page 11 of brief.) \n* Compare Griffin v. County School Board, 377 U.S. 218, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964). While a State may delegate \ncertain of its functions to smaller subdivisions such as cities or counties, it cannot escape accountability for their actions. \nSuch subdivisions are \"created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may \nbe entrusted to them * * * The number, nature, and duration of [their] powers * * * and the territory over which they shall be \nexercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state.\" Hunter v. City of Pittsburg, 207 U.S. 161, 178, 28 S.Ct. 40, 46, 52 \nL.Ed. 151 (1907). \n[23] For years black children in the Carver School District were assigned to black schools in the inner city because no white \nsuburban district (or white school in the city) would take the children. \n[24] These findings are made on the basis of the present record and are subject to modification based on evidence which \nmay be developed once the specific problems of actual desegregation are faced in the planning process. \n[25] See, Kelley, et al. v. Metropolitan Bd. of Educ., 463 F.2d 732, page 744, May 30, 1972: \n\"Perhaps the primary thing that the Swann case decided was that in devising plans to terminate such residual effects, it is \nappropriate for the school system and the District Judge to take note of the proportion of white and black students within the \narea * and seek as practical a plan as may be for ending white schools and black schools and substituting therefor schools \nwhich are representative of the area in which the students live.\" \n\n* The area referred to in this case is all of Davidson County, including the City of Nashville, which is included in the \njurisdiction of defendant Metropolitan Board of Education. \n ",
