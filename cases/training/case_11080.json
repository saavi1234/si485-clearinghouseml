The plaintiffs, represented by the Mental Health Law Project and the Public Defender's office, claimed that they had been committed to the hospital upon a showing of mental illness by a preponderance of the evidence--the standard in force at the time of their confinement--but that the Supreme Court had later held that the constitutionally required standard was by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" The plaintiffs wanted this later-established standard retroactively applied to their confinement.</p><p>The United States removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The District Court (Judge Barrington D. Parker) certified a class consisting of all patients committed to the facility for more than six months. The plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment with regard to a subclass of patients who had been committed before 1973, under the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. And on May 19, 1987, the District Court (Judge Parker) granted their motion, holding that the subclass's due process rights had been violated, and ordered judicial review of their present commitment status under the prevailing constitutional standards. </p><p>On Oct. 1, 1987, responsibility for St. Elizabeths shifted from the federal government to the District of Columbia. The federal district court then substituted the responsible District of Columbia official and transferred the subclass action back to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, directing that each member of the subclass be provided with a commitment hearing. The district court retained jurisdiction over the subclass and required the superior court to file status reports. On March 20, 1992, the federal district court remanded all remaining issues to the Superior Court.</p><p>A great majority of the patients received favorable results from their commitment hearings. They then moved under the Equal Access to Justice Act to recover attorneys' fees from the federal government for attorneys' fees incurred during proceedings before the federal district court and before the Superior Court. The district court granted the requested attorneys' fees and the government appealed. On Feb. 15, 1994, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the government's responsibility to pay fees associated with the action before the federal district court, but determined that it did not have to pay fees associated with the individual commitment hearings before the D.C. Superior Court. 15 F.3d 1126.</p>",

WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:\nThe federal government challenges an award under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\") for legal services rendered to\nplaintiffs in civil commitment hearings before the D.C. Superior Court. Finding no causal connection between the incurrence of\nthe fees and the position that the United States took without substantial justification, we reverse the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n* * *\nIn 1983 a class of patients at St. Elizabeths Hospital filed a habeas corpus action in D.C. Superior Court against the United\n\nStates, complaining that their continuing civil commitment violated a constitutional right to periodic reevaluation of their mental\nstatus. The United States petitioned for removal to a federal district court, which four years later found in favor of a subclass of\nthe plaintiffs. The winning subclass consisted of patients committed before this court's decision in In re Ballay, 482 F.2d 648,\n650 (D.C.Cir.1973), holding that civil commitment required proof of mental illness beyond a reasonable doubt (rather than\n\"preponderance of the evidence\", the standard previously applied). After Ballay but before the filing of suit, the Supreme Court\nheld that the constitutionally required standard was \"clear and convincing evidence\", Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct.\n1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), clearly more demanding than the one under which pre-1973 plaintiffs had been committed. The\ndistrict court found that the Addington standard should be applied retroactively to those patients, and that the violation should\nbe remedied by new hearings under the proper standard. Streicher v. Prescott, 663 F.Supp. 335 (D.D.C.1987).\nEffective October 1, 1987, responsibility for St. Elizabeths shifted from the federal government to the District of Columbia. See\n24 U.S.C. §§ 225 et seq. (1988). The federal district court then substituted the appropriate District of Columbia official as\ndefendant. On November 1, 1988, the court transferred the subclass action to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia,\ndirecting that each patient receive a commitment hearing under the procedures established by D.C. law — a hearing before the\nDistrict of Columbia Commission on Mental Health, followed by a report to the Superior Court and review by that court at the\noption of any patient found subject to commitment. Order of Reference to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Nov. 1,\n1988. The district court retained jurisdiction over the subclass, requesting the submission of status reports; at that time, it also\nretained jurisdiction over issues regarding the remainder of the class. The district court later granted a motion by the District of\nColumbia to remand the remaining issues to the Superior Court. Order, Mar. 20, 1992.\n[1]\nAfter the individual commitment hearings were resolved in favor of a great majority of the patients,  the subclass moved under\nEAJA to recover attorneys' fees from the federal government for class counsel expenses incurred in the proceedings before the\n1128 district court (against the U.S.) and those under the aegis of the Superior Court *1128 (against D.C.).[2] The district court\ndetermined that the United States had not been substantially justified in opposing the plaintiffs' demand for reevaluation of\npatient status under the heightened constitutional standard; it assessed attorneys' fees incurred in both the district court and the\ncommitment proceedings. Memorandum, May 15, 1990 (\"Memorandum on Fees\") at 4. After final judgment was entered on\nMarch 20, 1992, the United States appealed, challenging only that portion of the orders assessing fees incurred in the\ncommitment hearings. It has paid all the other assessed fees.\nThe United States offers two basic theories for why the Superior Court proceedings ought to be severed from those in the\ndistrict court. First, it argues that the substitution of the District of Columbia as the party with new responsibility for St.\nElizabeths terminated its liability for fees incurred after 1987. Second, it argues that because the patients would have incurred\nattorneys' fees for commitment hearings even if the United States had completely acquiesced in their claim at the outset, there\nis simply no link between the part of the litigation on which the United States took a position that was found lacking substantial\njustification and the civil commitment expenses themselves.\nIf EAJA were the only pertinent statute, the transfer of responsibility for St. Elizabeths to the District of Columbia might well be\ngrounds for denying recovery of the disputed fees. EAJA provides for award of fees \"in any civil action ... brought by or against\nthe United States,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), and, despite literal compliance with this language, the substitution of the District\nfor the United States might be taken to remove the post-transfer litigation from coverage. But Congress in the transfer statute\nprovided that the United States would be \"solely responsible for (1) all claims and causes of action against Saint Elizabeths\nHospital that accrue before October 1, 1987 ... and (2) all claims that result in a judgment or award against Saint Elizabeths\nHospital before October 1, 1987.\" 24 U.S.C. § 225g(h) (1988). Here the case arose out of the United States's pre-transfer civil\ncommitment procedures and its pre-transfer failure to remedy the constitutional defects in those procedures. So long as there\nwas an adequate causal link between the conduct of the United States (in and out of court) before the transfer, and the ensuing\nremedial hearings, it would make sense to regard any legal obligations incurred as a result of those hearings as having\n[3]\n\"accrued\" before the transfer. Thus, the United States's theory based on the transfer depends largely  on the strength of its\nother theory — that there is an inadequate causal link between the remedial hearings and the United States's \"unjustified\"\nposition (using \"unjustified\" as shorthand for positions not \"substantially justified\", 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A)). Accordingly we\nnow turn to that contention.\nIn fact, the United States's unjustified resistance in federal district court did not in any way cause the plaintiffs to incur fees in\n\nthe civil commitment hearings conducted under the aegis of the Superior Court. If the United States had responded to the\ncomplaint by an immediate offer to hold new commitment hearings under the Addington standard, and to release all plaintiffs\nnot found commitable, the plaintiffs would have had to incur every dollar of the civil commitment expenses.\nPlaintiffs respond to this in part by noting that the fee petition requested only fees paid to class counsel, not to the other\n1129 attorneys who represented individual class members. *1129 But the special services rendered by class counsel are no more\nattributable to the United States's unjustified resistance than are the other services. For example, class counsel served in ten\ntest cases that were used to accelerate and simplify the handling of the remaining patients. This appears to have been simply\nan economy of scale made possible by the fact that so many questionable commitments had accumulated over a long period. It\nwas not an incremental expense at all, much less one due to the United States's having initially taken an unjustified position. It\nis important to note that the only unjustified resistance identified by the district court was in the United States's \"steadfastedly\nopposing the motion for partial summary judgment\", Memorandum on Fees at 4, not its behavior before the filing of the suit or\nany behavior in the commitment proceedings themselves.\nClass counsel also supplied expert assistance on matters of mental health law, helped to improve communication with plaintiffs\nwhose clarity had been dulled by long-term confinement, and helped to organize \"woefully inadequate\" documents. But there is\nno suggestion that the communicative abilities of patients or the state of documentation were in substantially better shape at the\ninitial filing of suit in 1983 than at the time of transfer to Superior Court in 1988, such that prompt acquiescence in the complaint\nwould have seriously reduced the need for these efforts.\nThus the United States's initial opposition to the complaint was not a \"but for\" cause of the civil commitment litigation expenses,\nnor a cause in the sense of having increased the probability that such expenses would be incurred.\nFrom this lack of causal connection the United States derives the conclusion that the hearings are not part of the same \"civil\naction\" as the dispute in district court. Since EAJA provides only for award of fees incurred by a prevailing party \"in any civil\naction ... brought by or against the United States\", 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), it argues, the causal gap takes the hearings out of\nthe initial civil action brought against the United States.\nFramed as a gloss on the phrase \"civil action\", the United States's position is undermined by decisions holding that various\nproceedings on remand from district court to an agency fall within the initial \"civil action\". Thus in Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U.S.\n877, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989), the Court found that proceedings on remand to the Department of Health and\nHuman Services were part of a \"civil action\" challenging the Department's prior adverse determination, saying that \"where\nadministrative proceedings are intimately tied to the resolution of the judicial action and necessary to the attainment of the\nresults Congress sought to promote by providing for fees, they should be considered part and parcel of the action for which fees\nmay be awarded.\" Id. at 888, 109 S.Ct. at 2256. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizen's Council, 478 U.S. 546, 558-59,\n106 S.Ct. 3088, 3094-95, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986) (state administrative proceedings fall within an \"action\" under the fee shifting\nprovision of the Clean Air Act). The Court's decision in Shalala v. Schaefer, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239\n(1993), has modified Hudson, holding that where a court's jurisdiction terminates on its order of a remand, the initial civil action\ncomes to an end. Id. ___ U.S. at ___ - ___, 113 S.Ct. at 2628-31. But that development does not aid the United States here; the\ndistrict court retained jurisdiction and there is no claim that the retention was error.\nThe United States's basic argument about the absence of any causal link, however, seems to us sufficient regardless of the\nmeaning of the phrase \"civil action\". Courts have recognized that the lack of any causal link between government obstruction in\none phase of litigation, and the generation of costs in a later phase, makes it inappropriate to award EAJA fees for the second\nphase. Thus, in Kunz Construction Co. v. United States, 16 Cl.Ct. 431, 435 (1989), the court observed that where justified and\nunjustified government positions are taken in \"discrete phases\" of a litigation, such as ones on liability and damages, it may be\nan abuse of discretion not to \"segregate\" the fees. See also Ellis v. United States, 711 F.2d 1571 (Fed.Cir.1983) (awarding fees\n1130 for merits of *1130 litigation, but not for damages phase); Williams v. Bowen, 966 F.2d 1259, 1261 (9th Cir.1991) (analyzing\nissue of substantial justification separately for \"each stage of the administrative and court proceedings\"). Similarly, we have\nrefused to hold the United States liable for fees in those phases of litigation that occurred before its position lost its justification.\nPublic Citizen Health Research Group v. Young, 909 F.2d 546, 552 (D.C.Cir.1990). Another application of the underlying\nprinciple is the use of partial EAJA awards where claims are easily severable and the government's position was justified on\n\nsome of those claims. Alphin v. National Transportation Safety Board, 839 F.2d 817, 822 (D.C.Cir.1988); Smith by Smith v.\nBowen, 867 F.2d 731 (2d Cir.1989). Here, the shifts of venue and of parties, on which the United States focusses a good deal,\nsimply draw the dividing line between the separate phases with uncommon sharpness. The key is the causal gap, and the\nclarity of the separation serves mainly to eliminate any contention that the bother of distinguishing between the two phases\njustifies treating them as an aggregate.\nIt is quite true that the Supreme Court has observed that \"[w]hile the parties' postures on individual matters may be more or less\njustified, the EAJA — like other fee-shifting statutes — favors treating a case as an inclusive whole, rather than as atomized\nline-items.\" Commissioner, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 161-62, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 2320-21, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990); see also\nAnthony v. Sullivan, 982 F.2d 586, 589 (D.C.Cir.1993). There the Court rejected the United States's argument that despite\nliability for EAJA fees for the merits litigation, the United States should not be liable for fees in the fee litigation without a new\nfinding that the United States had resisted them without substantial justification. But the United States's stubbornness on the\nmerits was clearly a \"but for\" cause of the fee litigation, so award of the fees for fee litigation was necessary to internalize the\nfull cost of the United States's prior obstruction. See also Anthony v. Sullivan, 982 F.2d at 589 (want of substantial justification\non merits satisfies that requirement for fees for ensuing fees litigation); Trichilo v. Secretary of HHS, 823 F.2d 702, 708 (2d\nCir.1987) (similar); Smith by Smith v. Bowen, 867 F.2d at 734-35 (clarifying Trichilo); cf. Battles Farm Co. v. Pierce, 806 F.2d\n1098, 1101 (D.C.Cir.1986), vacated on other grounds, 487 U.S. 1229, 108 S.Ct. 2890, 101 L.Ed.2d 925 (1988) (\"the statute is\nmeant to discourage the federal government from using its superior litigating resources unreasonably — it is in this respect an\n`anti-bully' law\"). Thus Jean does not speak to instances where the second set of expenses would have been every bit as\n[4]\nnecessary if the United States had never taken an unjustified position.\nNone of this is inconsistent with the normal requirement that a litigant must, to qualify as a prevailing party under EAJA, secure\nsubstantive benefits of some sort. See Hudson, 490 U.S. at 886, 109 S.Ct. at 2255; Waterman S.S. Corp. v. Maritime Subsidy\nBd., 901 F.2d 1119, 1122 (D.C.Cir. 1990); but see Schaefer, ___ U.S. at ___ - ___, 113 S.Ct. at 2631-32 (holding plaintiff\nprevails once he obtains a remand under sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)). Nothing in EAJA suggests that each element\nnecessary to a party's achieving \"prevailing party\" status is ipso facto compensable. In fact, courts have allowed parties to point\nto events outside of the litigation to establish that they prevailed. See, e.g., Public Citizen Health Research Group, 909 F.2d at\n549-51 (plaintiff attains prevailing party status on basis of agency changes of position for which suit was \"catalyst\"). Accordingly,\n1131 the fact that the plaintiffs were required to wait for *1131 the outcome of the commitment hearings before they were eligible as\n\"prevailing parties\" does nothing to affect the causal gap that necessitates severing those hearings from the first phase of the\nlawsuit.\n* * *\nAppellees filed a cross appeal, objecting to the district court's refusal to award a \"special factor\" enhancement of the fees\nbecause of the expertise in mental health law of the counsel for whom fees are requested, lawyers associated with the Judge\nDavid Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Because we reverse the award of attorneys' fees we need not address that issue.\nThe decision of the district court is\nReversed.\n[1] Of 217 committed inpatients, only 28% retained inpatient status after the hearings. Of 92 committed outpatients, only 8% continued\ntreatment in that capacity.\n[2] EAJA awards fees and other expenses to any \"prevailing party other than the United States ... [which are] incurred by that party in any\ncivil action ... brought by or against the United States ..., unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially\njustified or that special circumstances make an award unjust\". 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n[3] Not entirely, however. One might argue that even with an adequate causal relation between the United States's unjustified position and\nthe remedial hearings, and even with the transfer statute's savings clause, EAJA may not be applied to counsel fees incurred in\nproceedings between individual plaintiffs and the District of Columbia. EAJA, after all, seems to assume some dispute between the United\nStates and the prevailing party. On the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to reach this issue.\n\n[4] We note that in Shalala v. Schaefer the Supreme Court observed that despite that decision's limiting of Sullivan v. Hudson, a remand\nunder \"sentence six\" of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) would not terminate the initial civil action. ___ U.S. at ___ n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2631 n. 4.; see also\nCurtis v. Shalala, 12 F.3d 97, 100 (7th Cir.1993). These remands occur when the Secretary requests a remand before answering a\ncomplaint or where new evidence counsels in favor of additional agency proceedings. Schaefer, ___ U.S. at ___ n. 2, 113 S.Ct. at 2629 n.\n2. The Court's observation of course goes only to the scope of a civil action and does not reach the issue of whether fees incurred on\nremand during a civil action are compensable even where not caused by the government's having taken an unjustified position.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
