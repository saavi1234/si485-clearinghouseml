This  land  was  to  be \n \nconveyed  under  a  new  federal  program  called  “New \nTown in Town” or “Federal Lands for Urban Community \nNeeds.”  The  program  was  designed  to  employ \nunderutilized lands in the federal inventory to promote the \nexpedited  construction  of  racially  and  economically \nintegrated  housing  and  to  provide  such  housing  in \nconjunction with high-quality facilities (Tr. 499-501). A \nstated objective of the program was to overcome patterns \nof segregation that were apparent in many cities (Tr. 501). \nThe “Crile” site was selected by a Special Task Force as \none of the primary sites in the program (Tr. 508), and a \nteam, led by Dorn C. McGrath of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, was sent to meet with \nofficials of Parma and Parma Heights (Tr. 508). \n  \nAt the meeting, Dr. McGrath explained to the two mayors \nthat the program’s objective was to provide housing for \npeople of all income levels, including low and moderate, \non an open-occupancy basis, although some industrial or \ncommercial  development  of  the  site  would  also  be \npossible (Tr. 511-513). He stressed that the goal of the \n \nprogram  was  not  to  place  public  housing  in  the \n \nmunicipalities, but to achieve both economic and racial \n \nintegration (Tr. 513-518). \n  \nMayor Petruska was opposed to the use of this land to \n*1102 APPENDIX II  build  racially  integrated  housing.70  He  equated  any \ninvolvement of Parma in such a program with Parma’s \n  contribution to Cuyahoga County’s welfare coffers (Tr. \n512-513) and said that Parma did not need housing on the \n“Crile” site or elsewhere (Tr. 512-513, 1329). Instead, he \nsaid that Parma needed the site for certain municipal \nTHE “CRILE” SITE \nfacilities, such as an archery range and a place to put \nsnow removal equipment in the off-season (Tr. 526).

However, the Court finds inescapable \nthe conclusion that Parma chose the alternative that would  494 F.Supp. 1049 \nnot have an integrative effect.

Issues 1, 4-5 (1978). Whites living in or near areas of \nminority concentration in Cleveland also could not get loans because of red-lining (Tr. 973-974) and this accelerated \nthe movement of whites to the suburbs (Tr. 158-159). \n \n12  Dr. Bonutti, Parma’s expert witness, defined an ethnic as any person who feels part of a subcultural group \n  emphasizing a language, religious, and cultural difference from those of the main culture of the United States (Tr. \n874). Dr. Bonutti contends that “almost everybody in the United States is an ethnic”. (Tr. 875). Dr. Bonutti’s \ndefinition of “ethnicity” is certainly not a model of clarity. He claims that ethnicity is a subconscious state apparently \ntransmitted by parents, which remains with the individual even when expressly rejected. It is “the element which \ncreates our own or enforces the type of personality we have, the type of relationship we lay (sic) with others.” (Tr. \n45 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n875). \n \n13  Dr. Bonutti erroneously attempts to rely on a study by Father Navins. However, that study does not deal with the \n  issue of whether blacks desire to move out of their neighborhoods (Tr. 945, 975). He also relies on a simple quote \nconcerning a poll discussed in a study by Edward Banfield which does not deal with Cleveland (Tr. 975). \n \n14  There is some evidence indicating that blacks are fearful of moving to the white suburbs because of hostility on the \n  part of some whites (Tr. 227). This is merely another manifestation of the discriminatory environment which has \nconfronted blacks in the Cleveland area. \n \n15  Dr. Bonutti is unable to give a precise figure regarding the size that would enable a corridor to form. The minimal \n  number appears to be ten thousand (Tr. 901). \n \n16  There are many fourth and fifth generation blacks in Cleveland, but few have moved to the suburbs. This is unlike \n  the Appalacians who settled in Cleveland after the post-World War Two influx of blacks, but who have moved to the \nsuburbs to a much greater extent (Tr. 201). \n \n17  Even Dr. Bonutti’s own experience is contrary to his theory. He is of Slovenian ancestry and immigrated to the \n  United States in 1950. (Tr. 858-860). He settled in an area of Slovenian concentration because he didn’t speak \nEnglish and had no friends in Cleveland. He now lives in Pepper Pike, an exclusive area outside of the Slovenian \n“corridor” (Tr. 921-924). \n \n18  Former Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes described the situation more colloquially: blacks have not crossed the \n  Cuyahoga River and “not because they couldn’t swim.” (Stokes dep. 75). \n \n19  The census identifies “foreign stock” as people who are foreign born or who had a foreign born parent (Tr. 413). \n \nActual and Predicted Percentage of Foreign \n \n------------------------------------------ \n \nStock Population in Selected Geographical \n \n46 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v.

Areas of difficulty include a not totally \n  satisfactory data base, somewhat pliable explanatory concepts (i. e. ethnicity), the multiplicity of factors which \ninfluence individual residential choices, and the inability conclusively to isolate controlling factors affecting choice. \nThere is, however, no requirement that statistical evidence amount to proof to a mathematical certainty. While \ndeficiencies may detract from the value of statistical evidence, the evidence may still be probative. Detroit Police \nAss’n v. Young, 608 F.2d 671, 687 (6th Cir. 1979). \n \n21  This Court is well aware that in many instances, reputations are not well deserved. But the existence of an image, \n  even if unjustified by the underlying facts, is a relevant and important factor in explaining residential choice. \nAdditionally, it forms part of the historical background against which evidence must be weighed. \n \n22  The Court does not find, based on the present record, that Parma is in fact the western suburb most hostile to \n  blacks. Any such finding would require a comparative analysis of the relevant suburbs. \n \n23  Mr. Kuczma made no attempt to retract his statement (Kuczma dep. 132) and realized that it would have a lasting \n  effect. He testified: “Even if the newspaper printed a retraction in bold one-inch letters across their next issue, the \nimpact would be there” (id. at 109). \n \n24  This attitude continues to be expressed by Mayor Petruska. At trial he insisted that Parma was integrated when it \n  had three black families, because “the numbers don’t count.” (Tr. 1396-1397). In his deposition, Mayor Petruska felt \nunable to respond to the question of whether he favored racial integration in Parma (Petruska dep. 277-278). By the \ntime of trial, he was able to modify but not clarify his response: “I have no problem with it.” (Tr. 1394). \n \n49 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n25  Another action challenged by the government took place shortly before the Fair Housing Act was passed and \n  therefore cannot constitute an independent violation of the Fair Housing Act. Cf. Hazelwood School District v. \nUnited States, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1979). It is discussed in Appendix II. \n \n26  The fair housing proposal in its entirety is as follows (Gov. Ex. 122): \n \nWHEREAS, some of the residents of the city of Parma have requested the Parma City Council to pass a resolution \nconcerning a position on Fair Housing; and \nWHEREAS, there is a great general interest in the position of every city on Fair Housing. \nWHEREAS, all persons of goodwill have been and are welcome as residents of the city of Parma. \nWHEREAS, all property owners of the city of Parma shall and do have the right to control the sale of their property \nas they wish; and \nWHEREAS, no municipal authority should enact any legislation or pass any resolution that would diminish the \nrights that a person acquires when he becomes a property owner. \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PARMA, COUNTY OF CUYAHOGA AND STATE \nOF OHIO: \nThat all persons of goodwill have been and are welcome in the city of Parma by this Council; and \nThat realizing this or any other resolution should not be used to enforce morality; this Council defends the \nindividual property owners right to sell, lease, rent, control or dispose of their private homes and their right of \nassociation and the private enjoyment and use of their own homes. \n \n27  Mr. Sands recalled only one other proposed legislation that evoked an equivalent reaction a proposal relating to gun \n  control (Sands dep. 24). \n \n28  Mayor Petruska does not recall this meeting (Petruska dep. 33). The testimony of Mary Dunning on this point is \n  discounted. She testified about a meeting in late 1967 or 1968 which discussed a fair housing resolution proposed \nby Operation Equality (Tr. 1293-1294). This is not the same as the resolution proposed by Mr. Sands in mid-1968 see \nSands dep. 10). \n \n29  At trial, Parma asserted that the resolution might have been defeated because of language reaffirming the individual \n  property owner’s unfettered right to sell and rent property. The Court notes the self-serving nature of this asserted \njustification and finds no support for it in the record. \n \n30  In 1968, the city of Parma Heights adopted a differently-worded Fair Housing Resolution which apparently has not \n \n50 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \nappreciably altered the racial composition of that city (Tr. 1417). \n \n31  The 1978 occupancy reports (Gov. Ex. 11) show that black families resided in 5,269 of the 7,903 units leased by \n  CMHA (or 66%). In 1971, CMHA leased 8,768 units, of which 5,646 (or 64%) were occupied by blacks (Gov. Ex. 13). \n \n32  Gov. Ex. 107 shows the location of all public housing projects. Five projects (Riverside Park, Crestview, Riverview, \n  Lorain Square and West Boulevard Place) are in white neighborhoods. There are 1578 families living in these \nprojects, of whom 486 are non-elderly (Gov. Ex. 11). 197 of the 486 non-elderly families are black (40.5%), while 95 \nof the 1092 units for the elderly (8.7%) are occupied by blacks (id.). \n \n33  One study has found that there are about 15,000 families living in the suburbs who are eligible for public housing \n  (Gov. Ex. 22). Another approximately 8,900 families now residing in Cleveland, who are eligible for but do not live in \npublic housing, desire to move to the suburbs (id.). Thus, the net suburban need for public housing amounts to \nabout 24,000 families. \n \n34  Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by Section 201(a) of the Housing and Community \n  Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. s 1437f, and by the Housing Authorization Act of 1976, s 2, 90 Stat. 1068. \n \n35  No accurate figure exists regarding the number of low-income blacks who desire to move to Parma. One study \n  places the total number of persons wishing to move to Parma at 1300 (Gov. Ex. 22). There is no evidence to indicate \nthat even with Parma’s racially exclusionary image, substantial numbers of blacks are not included in that number. \n \n36  The Mayor stated that the apartment units “are not federally financed housing, are not low income and are not \n  senior citizen housing. Rather, they are high quality, high priced units with starting rates of $175 for a one bedroom \napartment on up to $270 per unit.” (Gov. Ex. 75). \n \n37  At trial, Mayor Petruska testified that he was not opposed to public housing in Parma if CMHA were not involved \n  and added “as a matter of fact, we have such a project” (Tr. 1337). There is no evidence in this record that such a \nproject exists; in fact, the record refutes this claim. \n \n38  Parma, for example, could participate in the Section 8 program without CMHA. And even in the area of conventional \n  public housing, Parma officials were well aware that such housing could be built without CMHA involvement (Tr. \n1377-1378; Petruska dep. 212). \n \n51 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n39  Parma relies on a 1973 study to prove that CMHA’s operations were inadequate (Def. Ex. DS). There is no evidence \n  in the record to indicate that Mayor Petruska had ever read or been aware of the study prior to trial in 1979. \n \n40  See, e. g. Mayor Petruska’s views of HUD reports showing Parma’s need for low-income housing (Tr. 1382, 1384; \n  Petruska dep. 221-225). \n \n41  There is no evidence in the record indicating whether construction actually began prior to approval of the plans or \n  whether there was a tacit understanding not to commence construction until final plans were approved (Reinke \ndep. 170-171). In either case, the normal procedures for building permit issuance were not followed. \n \n42  The complex was built under a HUD program entitled Section 221(d)(4), which is not a government subsidy program, \n  but under which the building mortgage is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (Tr. 585-586, 618-619). \n \n43  Forest City asked the Parma City Council to rezone the parcel of land from residential to high-rise classification E-5, \n  which would allow construction up to 100 feet high (Dunning dep. 10-13; Sands dep. 51). The rezoning proposal \nattracted both support and opposition. The Parma Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Education voiced their \nsupport for the proposal (Gov. Ex. 49, 50, 51) citing, among other things, the increase in tax dollars which the \nproposed new apartment development would bring into the City. Paul Kisil, a Parma City Councilman at the time, \nfelt that the rezoning was good planning for Parma (Kisil dep. 36). Opponents of the proposed rezoning of the \nParmatown Towers site claimed that the new apartment complex would cause sewer and traffic problems (Sands \ndep. 47-48; Dunning dep. 27-28; Kopchak dep. 15; Tr. 1282-1283), was not safe from a fire standpoint (Kopchak dep. \n15; Dunning dep. 27-28), and would be too high (Kisil dep. 25). \n \n44  The minutes of the Planning Commission meeting of May 11, 1971 (Gov. Ex. 85) indicate approval of the Parmatown \n  Towers development subject to an opinion of the City Solicitor, Andrew Boyko, on the legality of a change from a six \nto ten-story building. Boyko subsequently issued an opinion stating that such a change could be made legally (Tr. \n1172-1173). \n \n45  Parma’s decision was to ignore the requirement of Planning and Zoning Code s 1101.06; it did not result from \n  unawareness. Russell Rienke, the City Engineer of Parma who reviews building plans and has been doing so for \neleven and one-half years (Tr. 1186; Reinke dep. 5-6), has knowledge of this Parma ordinance requiring acceptance \nand  dedication  of  a  street  before  the  issuance  of  a  building  permit  (Tr.  1233).  Jerry  Vittardi,  the  Building \nCommissioner who has been issuing building permits for over six years (Vittardi dep. 28, 30), is also knowledgeable \nwith regard to this ordinance (id. at 65). It is the responsibility of both of these men in the normal course of business \nto check compliance of any proposed development with this ordinance (Reinke dep. 129). \n \n46  The differences between a Section 236 project such as Parmatown Woods and a project such as Parmatown Towers, \n52 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n  developed under the Section 221(d)(4) program of HUD, were twofold: (1) a Section 221(d)(4) project did not \nreceive any federal subsidy, but only had its mortgage insured by the federal government (Tr. 618-619, 585-586), \nand (2) a Section 221(d)(4) project was aimed more at moderate income persons than low-income persons. \nGenerally persons with higher incomes would live in a building like Parmatown Towers rather than in a building like \nParmatown Woods (Tr. 619). \n \n47  Parma seeks to discount this statement by asserting that Mayor Petruska, and indeed all members of the Planning \n  Commission, favored the Parmatown Woods proposal. The evidence does not support this assertion. Although \nMayor Petruska voted to “approve” the proposal at the end of this Planning Commission Meeting, the “approval” \nwas conditioned on terms that made construction of the project impossible. Moreover, after the July 13, 1971 \nmeeting, Mayor Petruska stated publicly that proper plans had not yet been filed for the proposal and that “(u)ntil \nproper plans are filed, we really have no accurate facts for anyone to make a decision all we have is speculation” \n(Gov. Ex. 75, p. 2). \n \n48  Communications between HUD and Forest City in the summer and fall of 1971 showed that on June 10, 1971 the \n  architectural exhibits were not acceptable for feasibility processing because there were some problems regarding \ncertain aspects of the access road (Def. Ex. L). On July 16, 1971 a cost calculation discrepancy was discovered and \nthe plans did not show any covered parking spaces (Def. Ex. P). \n \n49  At trial, Parma claimed that the Parmatown Woods plans submitted by Forest City were not in conformity with three \n  sections of the Planning and Zoning Code: s 1101.06(d), which provided that no building permit be issued by the \nBuilding Commissioner until the adjoining street had been dedicated and accepted; s 1197.03, which specified that \nfor a building such as Parmatown Woods there be a minimum of three-quarters of a parking space per unit in an \nenclosed garage as part of the main building and which required that multi-family buildings provide for 21/2 parking \nspaces per unit; and s 1163, which provided that no property zoned for non-residential use should be used for \nresidential purposes. The alleged non-conformity with the requirements of s 1163 appears to be a reason advanced \nsolely for trial purposes. This post-hoc rationalization of Parma’s actions was never communicated to Forest City \n(see Gov. Ex. 70). Similarly, Parma did not rely, until trial, on non-conformity with the provision of s 1197.03 \nrequiring 21/2 parking spaces per unit. Forest City officials had indicated at the time they presented Parmatown \nWoods to the Planning Commission that they would seek a variance (Gov. Ex. 59), and Parma officials fully expected \nsuch a variance to be sought (Tr. 1345). It is inconceivable that a major housing project would be rejected on \naccount of non-compliance with parking requirements if the City, in good faith, expected a variance to be requested \nand intended to grant it. Finally, the treatment accorded Parmatown Towers indicates that the requirements of s \n1101.06(a) for a dedicated and accepted street were flexibly applied by Parma officials. \n \n50  Parma defends its conduct in rejecting the Parmatown Woods proposal by stressing that the record contains no \n  evidence regarding Forest City’s reasons for transferring the basic proposal from Parma to Parma Heights. The fact \nthat Independence Place was built only 100 yards from the site initially proposed in Parma supports only one \nexplanation. Forest City concluded that the project could not be constructed in the City of Parma. Forest City, a \nmajor developer in Parma, was obviously aware of the intense racial opposition to Parmatown Woods, see pp. \n1077-1082,  supra,  and  the  impossible  restrictions  which  the  Parma  Planning  Commission  had  imposed  on \nconstruction of the project. See p. 1080, supra. Forest City could not have ignored the significance of the timing of \n53 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \nthe rejection of the Parmatown Woods plans only one day after a general election in which two ordinances were \nenacted which destroyed any hope of constructing Parmatown Woods in Parma. See pp. 1086-1089, infra. \n \n51  Parma relies on Forest City’s Affirmative Marketing Plan for Parmatown Woods to show that the rejection of \n  Parmatown Woods had no discriminatory effect. The Plan stated partly that “(i)t is expected that only a small \nnumber of minority people will be interested in living in the proposed project. The majority of tenants are expected \nto be from the ethnic groups who are prominent in the project area at this time.” (Def. Ex. A). The Affirmative Action \nPlan nowhere speaks of the complete absence of blacks. In addition, HUD was critical of Forest City’s effort under \nthe plan. Finally, Parma’s racially exclusionary image, see pp. 1065-1066, supra, may account for the low expected \nnumbers of minorities. \n \n52  It is interesting to note that the aesthetic and ecological objections of Evelyn Kopchak, Parma City Councilwoman, to \n  high-rise buildings in the area of Parmatown Woods (Kopchak dep. 28) apparently only went as far as the \nboundaries of the City of Parma. The land on which Parmatown Woods was to be constructed is in the Parma city \nward which Ms. Kopchak represented when she was on the Parma City Council (id. at 60). After the Parmatown \nWoods proposal was rejected by the City of Parma in November of 1971, Forest City built basically the same project \nin Parma Heights called Independence Place (Tr. 602, 617-618). Independence Place was built only about 100 yards \naway from the site in Ms. Kopchak’s ward where it had been proposed originally (Tr. 1418-1419; Petruska dep. 74). \nIn spite of this, Kopchak did not express any objections, aesthetic or otherwise, to Parma Heights concerning the \nproposed construction of the Independence Place high-rise apartment complex (Kopchak dep. 165). \n \n53  Parma  argues  that  Parmatown  Woods  would  not  have  been  affected  by  these  ordinances  because  (1)  the \n  application for that project was pending at the time of their passage, and (2) only those ordinances in effect at the \ntime the application was filed would apply to that application. The Court is not persuaded by this. On November 3, \n1971, Forest City’s plans for Parmatown Woods were “rejected” and the entire building permit application was \nreturned to Forest City (Gov. Ex. 70). At that point, the Parmatown Woods application was no longer pending. A new \napplication would have had to have been submitted by Forest City in order for Parma to again consider the \nproposal. Any submission by Forest City after November 3, 1971 would have occurred while these ordinances were \nin effect and there is no reason to believe that a new application would not have to comply with all laws then in \neffect in Parma. This is consistent with the testimony of John Sands, former Parma City Councilman and Assistant to \nthe Mayor, who stated that as long as a building permit application meets the zoning code, an ordinance taking \neffect while the application was pending would not affect it (Sands dep. 52). This is also consistent with the trial \ntestimony of Andrew Boyko, Parma Law Director, who testified concerning Parma’s actions with regard to the \nMidtown Apartments in 1969 (Gov. Ex. 72, 73). Boyko at that time issued an opinion that a newly enacted ordinance \nin Parma would not affect a building permit application for Midtown which had been filed prior to the effective date \nof the ordinance. The Midtown application, however, had not been rejected and returned to the developer. In fact, \nconstruction on two of the three Midtown buildings had been approved, and the approval for the third building was \nonly “withheld” with no rejection (Tr. 1166-1168; Gov. Ex. 72, 73). \n \n54  The Court notes that forty-eight residents of Parma currently participate in Section 8 housing, and no evidence \n  exists that voter approval has been sought. \n54 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n \n55  Parma seeks to contest the effect of these ordinances by noting that there is no evidence in the record of any \n  proposed projects for low and moderate income families which were deemed to be impossible to build because of \npassage of the ordinances. This ignores the crucial fact that because the ordinances effectively preclude the \nconstruction of federally subsidized housing, no developer would waste money formulating an uneconomical \nproposal. Of course, the Parmatown Woods proposal was rejected the day after the ordinances were enacted. \n \n56  Typical apartments, even luxury ones, in the Cleveland area are occupied by families needing no more than two cars. \n  The pattern in the Cleveland area is for families or for persons with enough income to own two cars to buy homes \nand not to live in apartments (Tr. 803). \n \n57  One HUD official could not recall HUD’S ever allowing more than one and a half spaces per unit of multi-family \n  housing in the ten years he worked in that field (Tr. 620). Another witness with extensive housing experience stated \nthat in the areas in which he had worked 11/2 spaces per unit was the highest number of required spaces which he \nhad encountered for multi-family housing; for senior citizen housing, the number could be cut in half (Tr. 801-802). \n \n58  Parma has made a point of showing that its neighbor, Parma Heights, also has a 21/2 parking space per unit \n  requirement for multi-family dwellings (Tr. 1420). There is, however, one significant difference: Parma Heights \nroutinely grants variances to this requirement (Tr. 1430) and in fact granted a variance down to 0.84 spaces per unit \nto Forest City for Independence Place (Tr. 1421). Since 1971, Parma has not granted a variance to its 21/2 parking \nspace requirement (Tr. 1259, 1262). \n \n59  One Section 236 developer with extensive experience indicated that the awareness of community resistance \n  influenced the decision not to build in Parma. “The judgment not to come to Parma was based on the attitude that \nwe thought was expressed in the initiative petition to pass these ordinances rather than the specific ordinance.” (Tr. \n815). \n \n60  At least three apartment complexes have been built since 1971. Parmatown Gardens is a garden apartment by \n  Forest City (Tr. 1244-1245, 1251), which is about 28 feet high (Tr. 1250) and stands on part of the land originally \nproposed for Parmatown Woods (Tr. 1210; Def. Ex. DJ). The Sandpiper development is a condominium development \nabout 25 feet high (Tr. 1244, 1250-1251; Vittardi dep. 117-118). The most recent multi-family project constructed in \nParma, the Kimberly Park Apartments (Tr. 1244, 1251; Reinke dep. 193-194), consists of luxury apartments, is about \n35 feet high, and has tennis courts and a swimming pool (Gov. Ex. 121; Tr. 1248-1249). \n \n61  “Expected to reside” refers to those persons who would be expected to come into a community in order to avail \n  themselves of an opportunity to be close to their employment (Tr. 716). \n \n55 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n62  In his letter, Petruska speaks of the “strong need” for senior citizen housing evidenced at public CDBG hearings (Gov. \n  Ex. 99, p. 1). If such a strong need indeed was discussed at these hearings, it is peculiar that the defendant’s notices \nof CDBG hearings, which set forth the subjects which had been brought out at a previous meeting, make no mention \nof this need (Def. Ex. CS, CT, CU, CV, CW; Gov. Ex. 88, 91). \n \n63  Parma’s contention that this action is time-barred by Section 812 of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. s 3612, \n  misconceives the relationship between Sections 812 and 813, as well as the nature of the government’s pattern or \npractice case. The simple heading of Section 812 Enforcement by private persons demonstrates the inapplicability of \nits statute of limitations to a suit by the Attorney General under Section 813. Additionally, the policies and practices \nchallenged by the government can not be limited to a single incident occurring at a specific time. To establish a \npattern or practice, the government must be able to challenge decisions which have been made over a period of \ntime. The practical effect of accepting Parma’s position would be to limit the Attorney General to patterns and \npractices which existed no longer than 180 days prior to the filing of a lawsuit. Such a position is clearly inconsistent \nwith a broad construction of the Fair Housing Act. See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. \n364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972). \n \n64  The Attorney General’s determinations of reasonable cause and general public importance are not reviewable by \n  the courts. United States v. Northside Realty Associates, 474 F.2d 1164, 1168 (5th Cir. 1973); id. 501 F.2d 181 (5th \nCir. 1974), rehearing denied, 518 F.2d 884 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 977, 96 S.Ct. 1483, 47 L.Ed.2d 747 \n(1976); United States v. Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., 474 F.2d 115, 125 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 826, 94 \nS.Ct. 131, 38 L.Ed.2d 59 (1973). \n \n65  The degree of scrutiny which the court applied in Citizens Committee for Faraday Wood v. Lindsay, 507 F.2d 1065 \n  (2nd Cir. 1974) also distinguishes that case from the present one. Because Faraday Wood involved the termination \nof  a  primarily  middle-income  project,  and  there  was  no  disproportionate  representation  of  minorities  in \nmiddle-income levels, the careful scrutiny traditionally applied in typical low-income public housing was not \nemployed. Id. at 1068-1069. \n \n66  See James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 28 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971); City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, \n  Inc., 426 U.S. 668, 96 S.Ct. 2358, 49 L.Ed.2d 132 (1976); and Ranjel v. City of Lansing, 417 F.2d 321 (6th Cir. 1969), \ncert. denied, 397 U.S. 980, 90 S.Ct. 1105, 25 L.Ed.2d 390, reh. denied, 397 U.S. 1059, 90 S.Ct. 1352, 25 L.Ed.2d 680 \n(1970).  These  cases  do  not  support  Parma’s  contention  that  its  ordinances,  enacted  pursuant  to  initiative \nreferendums, do not violate the test of the Fair Housing Act. Unlike this case, the Court in James v. Valtierra noted \nthat “the record here would not support any claim that a law seemingly neutral on its face is in fact aimed at a racial \nminority.” 402 U.S. at 141, 91 S.Ct. at 1333. In City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., supra, there is no \nevidence that the Court was ever confronted with any evidence indicating a denial of housing because of race. \nFinally, in Ranjel v. City of Lansing, supra, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a lower court decision \nwhich had enjoined a referendum on a “spot” zoning ordinance. Not only did the Court determine that the lower \ncourt’s findings of racial discrimination were clearly erroneous, but it was concerned with the injunctive relief which \nwas granted prior to the referendum’s being held. \n \n56 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, Ohio, 494 F.Supp. 1049 (1980)   \n \n \n67  See Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 303, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 1549, 47 L.Ed.2d 792 (1976). \n \n \n68  See Acevedo v. Nassau County, 500 F.2d 1078, 1982 (2d Cir. 1974). \n \n \n69  Considered in isolation, no proof has been adduced that the parking ordinance, Planning and Zoning Code s 1197.03, \n  or the ordinance requiring voter approval of zoning changes, Building Code s 1229.01, were enacted with a racially \ndiscriminatory purpose. However, given the entirety of the evidence, an inference can be made that individual \nactions taken during the period when this policy was in force were done to further that policy. International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 362, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1868, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). This Court \nneed not draw such inference. These ordinances have had a racially segregative effect. The evidence points to no \nlegitimate interest, in theory or practice, served by the parking ordinance. In theory, there exists legitimate \ngovernmental interest behind the ordinance requiring voter approval for zoning changes. Such an interest, however, \n“must give way to prohibition in the Fair Housing Act that persons shall not be discriminated against on the basis of \nrace.” United States v. Housing Authority of Chickasaw, Civ. No. 79-0099-14 (S.D.Ala., decided March 7, 1980), p. 33. \n \n70  In his deposition taken on January 8, 1974, Mayor Petruska categorically denied that this meeting took place or that \n  he discussed housing with federal officials that year (Petruska dep. 226). It appears that he confused this meeting \nwith a subsequent meeting concerning the “Crile” site held on May 21, 1968, which was unrelated to the January \nmeeting, and which involved another proposed use for the land (Petruska dep. 226-229; Tr. 1329-1330, 1368-1369; \nDef. Ex. DZ). While Mayor Petruska conceded at the trial that residential use of the land was one of the subjects of \nthe January meeting (Tr. 1327), he denied that low-income or public housing was discussed (Tr. 1328-1329). In view \nof the Mayor’s sparse recollection of the meeting, and in view of the specified purposes of the “New Town in Town” \nprogram, the Court finds Dr. McGrath’s testimony concerning the meeting credible. \n \n71  The site is presently being used as part of the Cuyahoga Community College complex and for a baseball diamond \n  and other recreational facilities for Parma and Parma Heights (Tr. 1331-1332). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n57 \n ",

The witness who testified on this matter, Mr. Ernest R. Kubasek, is the \nChief Housing Inspector of the City of Parma. \nParma Mayor John Petruska testified that Westview and the adjoining area of Knollwood are “not up to what I \nwould consider proper housing for the people in the way of parking facilities, safety facilities. It’s a high crime \narea. It’s probably the worst area of our community.” (Tr. pp. 294-95). \nWithout addressing here Parma’s desire to house low-income people in a high crime area, the worst area of their \ncommunity, the Court does not consider this proposal to be particularly helpful (1) because of its limited scope in \nterms of the liabilities found and (2) because no one empowered to effect the rehabilitation and conversion to \nlow income use was presented at trial. In the comprehensive remedy which is required in this case, the potential \ndesirability and feasibility of the use of any particular property is better left to the Fair Housing Committee, \ndiscussed below. \n \n3  See, for example, The Plain Dealer, Thursday, October 16, 1980, at p. 4-B, quoting Parma’s brief filed October 14, \n  1980. \n \n4  The specific wording of such a resolution should, of course, be left for Parma to formulate. In this regard, the Court \n  takes notice of the testimony of Paul Davidoff, the government’s expert witness at the remedy proceeding, who \ntestified concerning further action which Parma could take in connection with the fair housing resolution. \nSpecifically, Mr. Davidoff recommended that Parma enact a fair housing ordinance and develop a statement of \ncriteria for judging its own progress in working constantly to expand housing opportunity. (Tr. p. 38) This Court \nbelieves  firmly  that  the  cause  of  equal  housing  opportunity  in  Parma  would  be  greatly  served  by  the \nestablishment  in  Parma,  in  conjunction  with  the  passage  of  a  fair  housing  resolution,  of  a  fair  housing \nenforcement mechanism to handle housing discrimination complaints in the City. Such a mechanism, which may \n10 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, 504 F.Supp. 913 (1980)   \n \n \nbe eligible for federal funding, would reduce reliance on federal enforcement of fair housing and strengthen local \ncommitment to open occupancy. The Court suggests that Parma gives serious consideration to such a procedure. \n \n5  Thus, Section 815 of the Fair Housing Act provides that “any law of a State, a political subdivision, or other \n  jurisdiction that purports to require or permit any action that would be a discriminatory housing practice under this \ntitle shall to that extent be invalid.” 42 U.S.C. s 3615. \n \n6  Conditions 1-3, supra, are consistent with this Court’s duty to avoid unreasonable intrusion into Parma’s affairs \n  while at the same time safeguarding the rights of those protected by the Fair Housing Act. It is a reasonable \nprovision, as testified to by Parma’s expert witness, Harry Henshaw. (Tr. pp. 364, 369) This provision does not imply \nthat, with regard to the Parking and Zoning Referendum ordinances, Parma should not be allowed to impose \nreasonable parking and zoning requirements on residential development in the City. Where allegedly reasonable \nrequirements clash with the development of low or moderate income housing, Parma’s Fair Housing Committee \n(see infra ) should decide on the reasonableness of such requirements in light of the purposes and goals of this \nOrder. \n \n7  By low and moderate income housing is meant housing which is affordable by those households earning 80% or less \n  of the median income for the Cleveland metropolitan area. \n \n8  In addition, if the Committee heeds this Court’s suggestion, formulating a fair housing enforcement program for the \n  City. \n \n9  Such  incentives  could  include,  among  other  things,  density  bonuses,  promise  of  reasonable  variances,  cost \n  write-downs on City-owned land and easing of the bureaucratic process. \n \n10  The Committee may also consider proposing that Parma should not conduct City business with any real estate or \n  development concern which has not signed an assurance of nondiscrimination in the conduct of its business. \n \n11  To the extent permitted by Ohio law. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude Parma from exploring other \n  nondiscriminatory public housing options which may involve different construction/management methods than are \nnormally utilized. \n \n12  To the extent permitted by Ohio law. \n \n \n11 \n \n\n \n \nU.S. v. City of Parma, 504 F.Supp. 913 (1980)   \n \n \n13  To the extent that land is suitable for such development with the exception of the land’s zoning classification, and \n  the Fair Housing Committee determines that a change in that zoning to a classification which would allow low or \nmoderate income housing development would be reasonable, the existing classification shall be changed to a \nclassification enabling construction of low or moderate income housing. \n \n14  This number is derived from Parma’s total need of 2669 households. Had Parma applied for CDBG funds and \n  submitted a Housing Assistance Plan to HUD setting forth this need, HUD would expect Parma to attempt to meet, \nby way of new construction, 15% of its needs over a 3 year period. This breaks down to approximately 5% per year, \nwhich is 133 units. (Tr. pp. 285-86) \n \n15  The Court has considered the balance of Parma’s objections and finds them to be without merit. \n \n \n16  In a thoughtful study of the use of Special Masters written under a contract with the Federal Judicial Center, Vincent \n  M.  Nathan,  Professor  of  Law  at  the  University  of  Toledo,  distinguished  the  pre-decretal  master  from  the \npost-decretal. “While the propriety of the appointment of a master prior to the issuance of a remedial decree \nshould be measured by (the Rule 53) test, the same is not true of a post-decretal appointment under which a \nmaster’s tasks will relate to monitoring and possibly to implementation of the court’s order.” (footnote omitted) \nNathan, Vincent M., “The Use of Masters in Institutional Reform Litigation,” A Report to the Federal Judicial Center, \nreprinted from the Toledo Law Review, Vol. 10, Winter 1979, at 432. \nThe propriety of a post-decretal appointment, however, should rest in the sound discretion of the trial court, \nand its decision to make such an appointment should be subjected only to an “abuse of discretion” standard on \nappeal. So long as the remedial phase of the litigation is sufficiently complex and comprehensive to suggest \nthat the court’s reliance upon the parties themselves is not calculated to produce ascertainable compliance in \nrelatively short order, the court’s decision to refer the matter to a master should not be disturbed. Id. at \n432-33. \n \n17  This Court sees no reason to wait five years before determining that a Special Master is needed in order to adhere \n  to the limited precedent available in fair housing cases. See Chicago Housing Authority v. Austin, 511 F.2d 82 (7th \nCir.1975); Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 384 F.Supp. 37 (N.D.Ill.1974). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n12 \n ",
