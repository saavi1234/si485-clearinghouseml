    "summary": "<p>As we have been unable to locate the complaint and a few of the earlier opinions for this case, some information in this summary is based on material made available by the Alabama Department of Human Resources and from the National Center for Youth Law.</p><p>On November 15, 1988, the children of Alabama with behavioral or emotional disorders filed an action against the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). The plaintiffs were represented by the Bazelon Center, Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, and  Southern Poverty Law Center. for (1) failure to provide plaintiffs and their families with in-home supports and other services needed to preserve family unity; and (2) to provide plaintiffs with appropriate care, treatment, and services after removal from home.  Plaintiffs asserted that DHR violated their constitutional rights to family integrity, proper care while in state custody, adequate mental health care, reasonable efforts toward reunification, and freedom from discrimination on the basis of their disabilities in violation of ยง 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p><p>According to the National Center for Youth Law, on April 19, 1989, the district court held that plaintiffs had a private right of action to enforce the federal statutory claims.  The court also rejected DHR's assertions of qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p><p>In June 1991, the court approved a consent decree that required the creation of a \"system of care\" run according to principles emphasizing placement prevention, family reunification, permanency, and home-based and community-based services.  The system was designed to assist children (1) with emotional or behavioral disorders who are in foster care; (2) with emotional or behavioral disorders who are at imminent risk of foster care placement; and/or (3) at imminent risk of foster care placement who are at high risk of developing emotional or behavioral disorders. </p><p> </p><p>The system of care is required to provide services to these children and their families to protect the children from abuse and neglect, and to enable the children to live with their families, achieve permanency and stability, and become stable, gainfully employed adults pursuant to an individualized service plan.  The decree is structured to ensure that family preservation services are provided to most children at imminent risk of foster placement.</p><p> </p><p>An implementation agreement, incorporated into the decree, describes how the state will achieve compliance with the decree through initiatives in staff training, service development, quality assurance, and advocacy for class members and their families.  Implementation began in October 1992.  Each year, a group of counties representing 15% of the child welfare caseload were targeted for reform.  These counties were required to implement fully the consent decree's requirements by the end of their \"conversion\" year.  The goal was full statewide compliance by October 1, 1999.  An independent monitor has been overseeing compliance. </p><p> </p><p>By fall 1993, though the first group of counties had achieved progress, obstacles in compliance remained, and the parties negotiated a new consent order to resolve implementation barriers.  The new order required hiring senior-level staff, setting caseload standards, creating a resource development plan, reinvesting cost-savings, and improving the system of contracting with private providers.</p><p> </p><p>Plaintiffs' March 1997 contempt motion was resolved with a consent order extending the time for compliance and granting other relief in February 1999.  One year later, the court approved an order to ensure that all child welfare workers were appropriately certified and licensed. </p><p>In November 2004, defendant filed a motion for an order terminating the consent decree.  In May 2005, the court found that DHR had not submitted evidence sufficient to sustain its burden of demonstrating that DHR is and will remain in substantial compliance with the terms of the consent decree and the implementation plan required for termination of the decree.  The court ordered DHR to file a performance report in August 2005.</p><p> </p><p>In August 2005, DHR submitted a performance report and a second motion for an order terminating the consent decree.  The court requested that the court monitor file a report responding to the assertions in DHR's second motion and plaintiffs' response to that motion by November 18, 2005.  Following submission of the monitor's report, the court ordered the monitor to complete an extensive qualitative and quantitative review process to determine the counties' current compliance with the consent decree. </p><p> </p><p>On January 16, 2007, the court terminated the consent decree in a 148-page order.  Subsequently, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the lower court's decision.</p><p></p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION\nThis cause is before the court on Plaintiffsโ Motion for Attorneysโ Fees and Costs\n(Doc. No. 851), filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, the Consent Decree and the courtโs\nMemorandum Opinion and Order entered in this case on January 16, 2007.  The Motion\nis accompanied by a Memorandum of Law and an Evidentiary Submission.  (Doc. Nos.\n852- 865.)  Defendant filed a Response,1 and Plaintiffs submitted a Reply.  (Doc. Nos.\n870, 872.)  \n1 Defendant was sued in his capacity as the commissioner of the Alabama\nDepartment of Human Resources (โDHRโ).  Because a lawsuit against a public official in\nhis official capacity is, in effect, a suit against the underlying public entity, the court\nrefers to โDefendantโ and โDHRโ interchangeably.\n\nThis lawsuit concluded with the Eleventh Circuitโs affirmance and mandate\nentered on April 29, 2008.  This opinion addresses only the outstanding dispute between\nthe parties concerning Plaintiffsโ recovery of reasonable attorneysโ fees and expenses\nspanning October 2004 to January 2007.  While the parties have long agreed that\nPlaintiffs are the โprevailing partiesโ and, thus, entitled to recover reasonable attorneysโ\nfees and expenses, they disagree as to what is reasonable.  (See Consent Decree ยถ 88,\nentered June 11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235)); (Def. Resp. at 12 (Doc. No. 870).)  In all,\nPlaintiffs assert that the disputed attorneysโ fees amount to $201,989.75 and that the\ndisputed expenses add up to $39,977.91, for a total of $241,967.66.  Responding to the\nMotion, Defendant indicates that, subsequent to Plaintiffs filing their Motion for\nAttorneysโ Fees and Costs, DHR approved and paid a portion of the fees and expenses\nrequested in the Motion, thereby decreasing the sum of the contested fees and expenses to\n$179,779.36.2  (Def. Resp. at 4 (Doc. No. 870).)  As to the $179,779.36, Defendantโs\nshort answer is that DHR โadequately and fairly has paid Plaintiffsโ counsel for all\nreasonable work and expensesโ and that no โadditional money is due to them.โ  (Id. at 1.) \nAfter careful consideration of the arguments of counsel, the relevant law and the material\nevidence, the court finds that Plaintiffsโ Motion is due to be granted in part and denied in\npart.\n2 Plaintiffs have not challenged Defendantโs assertions of payment or disputed the\nlower figure, so the court assumes that $179,779.36 represents the disputed amount of\nfees and expenses for the period of time in question.\n2\n\nII.  BACKGROUND\nThe background of this case is fully documented in the courtโs prior memorandum\nopinions and orders and the Eleventh Circuitโs opinion affirming this courtโs judgment. \n(See Mem. Op. & Order, filed May 2005 (Doc. No. 752)); (Mem. Op. & Order, filed Jan.\n2007 (Doc. No. 849)); (Per Curiam Op., filed March 2008 (Doc. No. 873).)3  That\nbackground need not be recounted here, as the parties are intimately familiar with this\nlitigationโs details.  The payment of Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees and costs, which presently\nis at issue, has been addressed in the Consent Decree and prior orders of the court.  (See,\ne.g., Consent Decree ยถยถ 88-90 (Doc. No. 235)); (Mem. Op. & Order, filed Oct. 1997\n(Doc. No. 438)); (Letter memorializing fee agreement reached in mediation, dated April\n15, 1998 (Def. Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 870)); (Order ยถ 4, filed Nov. 2003 (Doc. No. 687));\n(Mem. Op. & Order, filed Jan. 2007 (Doc. No. 849).)\n  \nIII.  DISCUSSION\nA.  Reasonable Attorneysโ Fees\nTo determine a prevailing partyโs reasonable attorneysโ fees, the court begins by\nmultiplying the reasonable hourly rate by the hours reasonably expended.  This figure,\ncalled the โlodestar,โ represents a presumptively reasonable fee, and the burden of\n3 This courtโs opinions are published, and the Eleventh Circuitโs opinion is\navailable online.  See R.C. v. Walley, No. 07-10667, 2008 WL 816679 (11th Cir. 2008)\n(per curiam) (unpublished); R.C. v. Walley, 475 F. Supp.2d 1118 (M.D. Ala. 2007); and\nR.C. v. Walley, 390 F. Supp.2d 1030 (M.D. Ala. 2005).\n3\n\nproving fees rests with the prevailing party.  Norman v. Housing Auth. of Montgomery,\n836 F.2d 1292, 1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 1988).  In Norman, the Eleventh Circuit discussed\nthe factors that apply to determine hourly rates and hours expended.  In its 1997\nMemorandum Opinion and Order, this court set out the Norman factors, and it applies\nthem here.  (See Mem. Op. & Order at 11-12 (Doc. No. 458).)  The court also is mindful\nthat it has directed Plaintiffs to โendeavor to minimize their fees and expenses.โ  (Order\nยถ 4 (Doc. No. 687).) \nAs stated, Defendant โdoes not contest the fact that, under the consent decree and\nthe orders of the court, Plaintiffsโ counsel are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable\nattorneysโ fees.โ4  (See Def. Resp. at 12 (Doc. No. 870).)  Defendant, though, maintains\nthat the โkey wordโ is โreasonableโ and that Plaintiffsโ present request is patently\nunreasonable as to both the hourly rates and the hours expended.\n1.  Hourly Rates\nDefendant argues that the requested hourly rates for Douglas Richard Miller\nNazarian ($325), Ira A. Burnim ($325), James Arnold Tucker ($250), Jane Neiswender\n4 In fact, at least since 1998 with few exceptions, Plaintiffs have billed, and\nDefendant has paid, the requested attorneysโ fees and expenses without the need for court\nintervention.  (See, e.g., Def. Resp. at 2-3 (Doc. No. 870).)  The court also recognizes, as\nDefendant points out, that for the disputed time period, i.e., October 2004 to January\n2007, Defendant has paid approximately 58 percent of the fees and expenses requested by\nPlaintiffs, and, as concerns fees, โDefendant has reimbursed Plaintiffs for the vast\nmajority of the hours their counsel have worked on the case.โ  (Id. at 3-4.)\n4\n\n($250), Karen Bower ($250), A. Zimmerman ($140), and โotherโ counsel with the\nAlabama Disabilities Advocacy Program ($175) are unreasonable.  (Def. Resp. at 8, 9\n(Doc. No. 870)); (Pls. Mem. of Law at 7 (Doc. No. 852).)  Defendant contends that\nPlaintiffs impermissibly and โunilaterally raisedโ the rates in October 2004 without court\napproval.  (Def. Resp. at 9 (Doc. No. 870).)  Defendant cites the courtโs Memorandum\nOpinion and Order, dated October 28, 1997, setting Mr. Burnimโs rate at $250 and Mr.\nTuckerโs rate at $175, and points out that, prior to October 2004, Plaintiffs billed โ[o]ther\n[ADAP] attorneys . . . at the rate of $135.00 per hour.โ  (Id.); (Mem. Op. & Order at 12\n(Doc. No. 438).)  Defendant urges the court to award fees at the rates provided in the\n1997 Memorandum Opinion and Order.  Defendant, though, made a similar argument in\n1997, asserting that the agreed-upon fee range set out in the 1991 Consent Decree\ngoverned โall past and future attorneysโ fees awarded in this matter.โ  (See Mem. Op. &\nOrder at 7 (Doc. No. 438).)  The court rejected the argument then and raised the hourly\nrates.  (Id. at 8-10.)  The court rejects the argument again today.5\nAs the court stated in its 1997 Memorandum Opinion and Order, โ[a] rate is\nreasonable if such rate โis the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for\n5 With that said, the court notes that it would have preferred Plaintiffs to have\nbrought the disputed issue of hourly rates to the courtโs attention when it first arose,\nrather than waiting almost two-and-a-half years.  At the same time, though, the court is\nnot persuaded, as argued by Defendant (see Def. Resp. at 12-13 (Doc. No. 870)), that\nPlaintiffsโ delay amounts to a waiver of additional fees.  (See, e.g., Letter memorializing\nfee agreement, placing responsibility jointly on the parties to submit certain fee disputes\nto the court (Def. Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 870).)\n5\n\nsimilar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation.โโ \n(Id. at 11 (citation omitted)); see also Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299.  The courtโs 1997 ruling\nwas predicated upon the โprevailing market rateโ in a prior decade.  The โreasonableโ rate\nin 1997 is not necessarily the โreasonableโ rate for the years presently in question (i.e.,\n2004-2007).  Moreover, in this long-running litigation involving institutional reform of\nDHRโs child welfare system, the following principle espoused in Norman rings\nparticularly true in this case:  โIn this circuit, where there is a delay the court should take\ninto account the time value of money and the effects of inflation and generally award\ncompensation at current rates rather than at historic rates.โ  836 F.2d at 1302.  For the\nreasons to follow, the court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the โprevailing\nmarket rates . . . have risen since 1997,โ but finds that Plaintiffs have not shown that the\nrates have increased to the levels requested.  (Pls. Mem. of Law at 13-22 (Doc. No. 852).)\nAgainst the backdrop of the courtโs familiarity with Plaintiffsโ attorneys and their\ndiligent work in this case, the court has considered the prevailing market rate as garnered\nby its own knowledge and experience.  See Loranger v. Stierheim, 10 F.3d 776, 781 (11th\nCir. 1994).  The court also has weighed the evidence concerning (1) customary fees in the\nrelevant legal community, which is not Washington, D.C., but the State of Alabama\n(compare Pls. Mem. of Law at 21 with 1997 Mem. Op. & Order at 13), (2) counsel for\n6\n\nPlaintiffsโ specialized skills and levels of experience6 and (3) the tremendous time\ninvolved in representing Plaintiffs in this complex litigation which reduced the time\nPlaintiffsโ attorneys were able to devote to other legal advocacy.  (See Pls. Mem. of Law\nat 24-28 (Doc. No. 852).)  Moreover, the court has factored into its decision the nature of\nthe professional relationship which has been intense and extraordinary.  Counsel has\nshouldered great responsibility for the better part of two decades to a multitude of\nchildren who have had to depend completely upon counsel for success in this litigation. \nTo borrow from the Honorable Myron H. Thompson,  \nIt is no easy task to represent such a plaintiff class in a lawsuit that has been\nongoing for so many years and in which there are multiple and complex\nlegal issues.  It is also quite difficult to represent a class of plaintiffs who\nare unlikely to be able to โvoiceโ their interests themselves.\nWyatt v. Sawyer, 67 F. Supp.2d 1331, 1353 (M.D. Ala. 1999) (Thompson, J.) (ruling on\na 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 fee petition).  Based upon the above factors, the court finds a\nreasonable hourly rate to be $275 for Mr. Nazarian and Mr. Burnim, $225 for Mr.\n6 For instance, the court is very familiar with the extensive qualifications and\nexpertise of Mr. Tucker, who has appeared before the court in this case more times than it\ncan count.  As another example, Mr. Nazarianโs high level of experience and expertise is\nset out in document number 772.  On the other hand, concerning Ms. Bower, Ms.\nNeiswender and Zimmerman, Plaintiffs have not documented their experience to the\ncourtโs satisfaction.  Rather, in their brief, Plaintiffs indicate only that Ms. Neiswender\nand Zimmerman are โassociates at Hogan & Hartsonโ and that Ms. Bower is a โBazelon\nattorney.โ  (Pls. Mem. of Law at 15-16 (Doc. No. 852)); (Pls. Reply at 3 (Doc. No. 872));\n(see also Def. Resp. at 8 (raising objections to fees claimed by Ms. Bower, Ms.\nNeiswender and Zimmerman (Doc. No. 870).)  The court, thus, does not know whether\nthese three attorneys are established experienced practitioners, and, accordingly, the court\nhas set their rates at the low end.  See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11\n(1984).\n7\n\nTucker, and $135 for Ms. Neiswender, Ms. Bower, Ms. Zimmerman and โotherโ ADAP\ncounsel.  This ruling resolves the dispute concerning hourly rates.   \n2.  Hours Expended\nAs to 580 hours claimed by Plaintiffs, Defendant has agreed that these hours are\nreasonable and has reimbursed Plaintiffs but, for the most part, at lower rates than the\ncourt has set today.  (See Pls. Mem. of Law at 6, 30-31 (Doc. No. 852).)  In accordance\nwith the courtโs ruling in the preceding subsection, as to these 580 hours, Defendant need\nonly pay the difference, if any, between the rate paid and the court-awarded rate.  As to\nthe remainder of the hours claimed by Plaintiffs, Defendant maintains that the hours โare\nunreasonable and should not be paid at any rate.โ  (Def. Resp. at 12 (Doc. No. 870).) \nThe court turns to Defendantโs specific objections as to the hours expended. \nOverall, Defendant complains that Plaintiffsโ bills โprovided insufficient detail to\ndetermine whether the fees were reasonable.โ  (Id. at 5.)  Defendant details twenty-four\nexamples in Exhibit 6, where, for instance, the nature of the work performed is described\nas โFile reviewโ or โFile organization and review.โ  (Def. Ex. 6 (Doc. No. 870-2)); (see\nalso Def. Resp. at 6, last paragraph, citing examples from Exhibit 6 (Doc. No. 870).) \nHaving reviewed Defendantโs Exhibit 6, the court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiffsโ\ndescription of the work performed is not sufficient to meet Plaintiffsโ burden of proving\n8\n\nentitlement to these fees.7  Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299; see also Wyatt, 67 F. Supp.2d\nat 1345 (fee movantโs burden โincludes . . . maintaining records to show the time spent on\nthe different claims, and setting out with sufficient particularity the general subject matter\nof the time expenditures so that the district court can assess the time claimed for each\nactivityโ); (Letter memorializing fee agreement (Def. Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 870).)  These\nhours total 84.2 and will be excluded from the fee award.  \nDefendant also objects to counsel for Plaintiffsโ fees expended in January 2007 for\npreparing the instant fee motion.  (See Def. Ex. 5, objecting to โany fees for work\nperformed after the dismissal of the consent decreeโ (Doc. No. 870-2).)  The court finds\nthat the Eleventh Circuitโs opinion in Thompson v. Pharmacy Corp. of America, Inc.,\ncited by Plaintiffs, forecloses this argument.  See 334 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir. 2003). \nThompson held that a statutory fee award encompasses payment for โreasonable efforts to\npursue those statutory fees.โ  Id. at 1245.  Wholesale exclusion of fees for making and\ndefending a request for fees, as urged by Defendant, is not warranted.  No other objection\nto the reasonableness of the quantity of hours has been made by Defendant, and the court\nfinds that the requested payment for 54.62 hours Plaintiffsโ counsel expended while\npursuing fees is reasonable and compensable.  \n7 In their Motion, Plaintiffs attempt to clarify the nature of some of the disputed\nfees set out in Defendantโs Exhibit 6 (see, e.g., Pls. Mem. of Law at 18 (Doc. No. 852)),\nbut the court finds that Plaintiffsโ explanation still lacks the clarity needed for the court to\nascertain whether the tasks warranted the number of hours expended.  \n9\n\nDefendant objects to all hours claimed for Ms. Neiswender (111.15 hours), Ms.\nBower (3.8 hours) and A. Zimmerman (.75 hours).  (See Def. Resp. at 8-9 (Doc. No.\n870)); (Pls. Mem. of Law at 6-7, 15-16 (Doc. No. 852)); (Pls. Reply at 3-4 (Doc. No.\n872).)  The court is not persuaded by Defendantโs primary challenge, which is that the\nfees should be denied because these individuals are not โattorneys of record.โ  (Def.\nResp. at 8-9 (Doc. No. 870)); see Hulex Music v. Santy, 698 F. Supp. 1024, 1034\n(D.N.H. 1988) (rejecting argument that attorney was not entitled to his fees because he\nโwas not plaintiffโs attorney of recordโ; โ[t]he work . . . was for the benefit of plaintiffs\nand necessary to the prompt resolution of their lawsuitโ).  Ms. Neiswender and Ms.\nBower, both of whom are attorneys, performed research and writing tasks in rebuttal to\nDefendantโs then-pending motion to terminate the Consent Decree.  (See, e.g., Pls. Mem.\nof Law at 15-16 (Doc. No. 852).)  As to Zimmerman, Plaintiffs represent that he/she is an\nassociate with Hogan & Hartson, a law firm which has been involved in this litigation for\nmany years.  Zimmerman performed limited work in this case during the same time frame\nas Ms. Neiswender and Ms. Bower, spending .75 hours in January 2005 retrieving cases\nand checking โKey Cites.โ  (Pls. Ex. D-7); (Pls. Reply at 3 (Doc. No. 872).)  The court\ncannot say that the use of additional attorney time, during what was a critical phase of the\nlitigation, is unreasonable.  Moreover, there is no argument from Defendant or any\nindication from the record that the time billed was duplicative or excessive.  See ACLU v.\nBarnes, 168 F.3d 423, 434-435 (11th Cir. 1999); (see also Pls. Mem. of Law at 15-16\n(Doc. No. 852).) \n10\n\n  Finally, Plaintiffs point out that Defendant objects to Plaintiffsโ requested payment\nfor 10.5 hours expended for counsel to respond to a motion to intervene.  (Pls. Mem.\nof Law at 17.)  The court finds that the authority relied upon by Plaintiffs supports their\nargument that these hours should be compensated.  See Dillard v. City of Foley, 995 F.\nSupp. 1358, 1371 (M.D. Ala. 1998).  The court also finds that the hours expended are\nreasonable in number.  Defendant has not provided any argument or authority to the\ncontrary.  (See generally Def. Resp. (Doc. No. 870).)\nThe court now has addressed all of Defendantโs specific objections raised in his\nbrief.  The court is mindful that there are other general fee objections which are buried in\nthe hundreds of pages of exhibits, but which are merely alluded to or omitted altogether\nin Defendantโs brief.  For example, Defendant states that Exhibit 6, discussed above,\nโcontains only a few examples of insufficient explanations of Plaintiffsโ counselโs work.โ \n(See Def. Resp. at 5 n.2 (Doc. No. 870).)  Defendant then invites the court to review\nโPlaintiffsโ Exhibits D-1 through D-50 for more complete information,โ (id.), the\ncourtesy copies of which fill up two expandable file folders, measuring more than four-\ninches in thickness.  On this record, the court declines Defendantโs invitation to scour\nPlaintiffsโ lengthy exhibits in search of fee requests which potentially could fall within\nthe ambit of Defendantโs general objections.  There is authority that โgeneralizedโ\nobjections to fee requests typically are โviewed as fatalโ and that, โunless clearly\nnon-compensable, all hours as to which [a] defendant[] ha[s] not made a sufficient\n11\n\nobjection should be accepted.โ  American Charities for Reasonable Fundraising\nRegulation, Inc. v. Pinellas County, 278 F. Supp.2d 1301, 1314-15 (M.D. Fla. 2003). \nHere, having reviewed the fee petition as a whole, the court is persuaded that the\nremaining hours claimed by Plaintiffs are not โclearly non-compensable.โ  Id.  More\nsignificantly, though, given the courtโs familiarity with this litigation and with the\nproceedings which were occurring during the times when Plaintiffsโ billing hours peaked,\nthe court finds that these remaining hours comport with โwhat the Supreme Court has\ntermed โbilling judgment.โโ  American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia v. Barnes, 168\nF.3d 423, 428 (11th Cir. 1999).  In short, the court finds that the billing hours not\nspecifically discussed in this opinion are acceptable, reasonable and compensable. \n3.  Lodestar and Conclusion\nAs detailed above, Plaintiffs are owed some, but not all, of the attorneysโ fees they\nrequest for their services performed between October 2004 and January 2007.  The\nmanner in which Plaintiffs and Defendant have presented the attorneysโ fees dispute,\nhowever, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the court to provide a bottom\nline figure of Plaintiffsโ recovery of attorneysโ fees by multiplying the reasonable hourly\nrates by the hours expended.  The court, though, is confident that its rulings as to the\nallowable hourly rates and recoverable hours will permit Plaintiffs and Defendant to\napply those figures to the disputed fees in order to ascertain the lodestar, which the court\n12\n\nfinds is the reasonable attorneysโ fee award in this case, and then to calculate the\nremaining unpaid fees owed to Plaintiffsโ counsel.   \n \nB. Expenses\nPlaintiffs seek expenses incurred between October 2004 and January 2007.  (See\nPls. Mem. of Law at 32-36, citing Pls. Ex. C (Doc. No. 852).)  The contested expenses\nfall into the categories of expert fees, travel, computer research and copying.  (See Pls.\nEx. C.)  The court addresses each in turn.  \nFirst, as pointed out by Plaintiffs, Defendant has refused to pay the fees of their\nnon-testifying expert, Mr. George Taylor.  (Pls. Mem. of Law at 16-17 (Doc. No. 852));\n(see also Pls. Reply at 4-5 (Doc. No. 872).)  Those fees total $15,468.75.  (Pls. Mem. of\nLaw at 33 (Doc. No. 852).)  In his Response, Defendant has not addressed Plaintiffsโ\nargument with which, as explained below, the court agrees.  \nThe Consent Decree expressly addresses the issue of the recovery of expert fees. \nNamely, it provides that Plaintiffsโ attorneys are โentitledโ to reimbursement from\nDefendant for โexpenses,โ including โthe fees and expenses of expert witnesses.โ \n(Consent Decree ยถ 90 (Doc. No. 235)); (see generally Def. Resp. (Doc. No. 870).)  Not\nonly does the Consent Decree permit Plaintiffs to recover expert fees, but it also provides\nthat expert fees incurred by Plaintiffs for the purpose of โopposing efforts by defendant or\nothers to modify or vacate this decree or the Implementation Planโ are recoverable. \n(Consent Decree ยถ 90); cf. Sierra Club v. Hankinson, 351 F.3d 1358, 1364 (11th Cir.\n13\n\n2003) (holding that plaintiffs could recover fees for non-testifying expert witness who\nhelped monitor the โhighly technicalโ consent decree).  \nThe purpose for which Plaintiffs retained Mr. Taylor is one expressly permitted\nunder the Consent Decree.  Mr. Taylor, for instance, submitted an affidavit in support of\nPlaintiffsโ opposition to Defendantโs first motion to terminate the Consent Decree and\nImplementation Plan.  In fact, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order denying\nDefendantโs motion, the court cited Mr. Taylorโs affidavit and ultimately reached the\nconclusion urged by Mr. Taylor.  See R.C. v. Walley, 390 F. Supp.2d 1030, 1042 (M.D.\nAla. 2005).  Stated differently, the court finds that Mr. Taylorโs work was โrelevant to the\nrights established by the decree and related to the terms of the judgment.โ  Sierra Club,\n351 F.3d at 1361.  Moreover, the court finds that the total fee, which breaks down to an\nhourly rate of $93.75, is reasonable.  Accordingly, the court shall award the expert fees in\nthe requested amount of $15,468.75. \nSecond, when billed, Defendant objected to Plaintiffsโ expenses incurred for\ncomputer research, stating, for instance, that computer research should be part of a firmโs\noverhead.  Defendant, though, has not addressed or elaborated upon his objection in his\nResponse to Plaintiffsโ Motion, (see generally Def. Resp. (Doc. No. 870)), and, after\ncareful consideration, the court concludes that the law is not on Defendantโs side.  (See\nPls. Mem. of Law at 35-36 (Doc. No. 852) (collecting cases).)  Having considered the\nrelevant legal authorities and having reviewed the charges, the court finds that the\nexpenses incurred by Plaintiffs for computer research are reasonable and minimal. \n14\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover $508.03 for these disputed expenses.  (See,\ne.g., Pls. Ex. C, containing line items for computer research).)\nThird, as correctly pointed out by Plaintiffs, reasonable travel expenses of out-of-\ntown counsel are recoverable pursuant to the Consent Decree.  (See Consent Decree ยถ 90,\nstating that โexpensesโ include โplaintiffsโ counselโs travel expenses (including the\nexpense of lodging, meals, and transportation while away from homeโ)); (Pls. Mem. of\nLaw at 33 (Doc. No. 852)); see, e.g., Richlin Sec. Service Co. v. Chertoff, ___ S.Ct. ___,\n2008 WL 2229175, *8 n.9 (2008) (noting that reasonable travel expenses are recoverable\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988).  The objection by Defendant is not that the disputed travel\nexpenses, totaling $5,967.83, were unreasonably incurred, but that they were not\nโadequately documented.โ  (Def. Resp. at 10 (Doc. No. 870)); (Pls. Mem. of Law at 33\n(Doc. No. 852).)  For example, Defendant points to Mr. Nazarianโs bill for travel between\nBaltimore and Montgomery in December 2004 and January 2005.  (Def. Resp. at 10\n(Doc. No. 870).)  Defendant says that DHR refused payment because โ[t]here were no\nreceipts or vouchers to document this travel[.]โ  (Id. at 10-11.)  \n The court carefully has considered Defendantโs objection concerning the lack of\ndocumentation and does not condone Plaintiffsโ failure to resolve this dispute without\ncourt intervention.  (See id. at 11.)  The court, though, declines in this particular instance\nto penalize Plaintiffs by denying the travel expenses because the court finds that the\nrecord is sufficiently detailed as to the nature and purpose of the expenses.  More\nspecifically, the court finds that the travel directly assisted Plaintiffsโ monitoring and\n15\n\nimplementation efforts.  (See Consent Decree ยถ 90.)  As represented by Plaintiffs, Mr.\nNazarianโs travel in December 2004 was for the purpose of attending a status conference\nordered and held by the court.  (Pls. Mem. of Law at 33-35 (Doc. No. 852)); (see also\nMinute Entry (Doc. No. 723), noting Mr. Nazarianโs attendance at the status\nconference)); (see also Order (Doc. No. 724), granting Mr. Nazarianโs motion to appear\npro hac vice.)  Additionally, the objected-to travels in January 2005 pertain to the\nattendance of out-of-town counsel (Mr. Nazarian and Ms. Nieswender) at a meeting\nwhich the parties agreed to convene in order to address the problem areas identified by\nthe court.  (See Order (Doc. No. 725).)  Furthermore, the court finds that these attorneys,\nwho were brought in at a critical phase (see Pls. Mem. of Law at 34 (Doc. No. 852)),\npossessed specialized skills in the subject matter of this litigation and that each was able\nto offer unique and distinct expertise in relation to Plaintiffsโ monitoring and\nimplementation duties.  The court finds that โ[t]his is not a case involving unreasonable\nor uncalled for use of distant lawyers.โ  Palmigiano v. Garrahy, 707 F.2d 636, 637 (1st\nCir. 1983).  Additionally, as noted, no objection has been lodged that the airfare rates and\nrelated travel expenditures were unreasonable or excessive in amounts.  For the foregoing\nreasons, the court finds that Plaintiffsโ requested travel expenses in the amount of\n$2,419.07 ($1,138.89 plus $1,280.18) are reasonable and recoverable.  \nIn his Response, Defendant also generally states, without any specificity or\ncitation to the thick record, that DHR did not pay other travel expenses for attendance at\nmeetings by multiple attorneys, for inaccurate travel distances, or for hotel and/or meals\n16\n\nwhich exceeded the state per diem rate.8  (Def. Resp. at 10 (Doc. No. 870).)  Again, the\ncourt will not take on the task of searching hundreds of pages of exhibits to ascertain\nexactly which expenses and which portion of those expenses fit Defendantโs general\nobjections.  The general objections, thus, are overruled.  In sum, as concerns travel\nexpenses, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover $5,967.83.  \nFourth, according to Plaintiffsโ calculations, there remain unpaid copying expenses\nin the amount of $14,647.90.  (See Pls. Ex. C, listing expenses requested by Plaintiffs,\nbut rejected by Defendant).  Defendant, on the other hand, states that DHR โhas always\npaid . . . for reasonable photocopying expenses.โ  (Def. Resp. at 11 (Doc. No. 870).) \nDefendant sets a ceiling for reasonable charges at $500 per month and argues that\nphotocopying charges which in any month exceed $500 are โexcessiveโ because Plaintiffs\ndid not provide any justification for the expenses.  (Id.)  By the courtโs calculation, the\nmonths in which copying charges exceed $500 and to which Defendant objects are as\nfollows:  August 2005, September 2005, October 2005, January 2006, March 2006, April\n2006, May 2006, June 2006 and August 2006.\nPlaintiffsโ billing statements merely specify for each month the โnumber of\ncopies,โ the โrateโ and the โtotalโ cost.  (See, e.g., Pls. Ex. D-36, billing for copying\nexpenses for April 2006.)  Absent any indication of the nature or purpose of the\nphotocopying, there is no way for the court to discern whether the copying costs are\n8 The court notes that the State of Alabama pays actual expenses for out-of-state\ntravel.\n17\n\nreasonable and, thus, recoverable.  See Fulton Fed. Sav. & Loan Assโn of Atlanta v.\nAmerican Ins., Co., 143 F.R.D. 292, 300 (N.D. Ga. 1991) (explaining that party seeking\nto recover copying costs must provide evidence of the nature of the documents copied\nand how they were used).  The only explanation Plaintiffs give is contained in their reply\nbrief in which they represent that they distributed courtesy copies to โopposing counsel\nand the Court Monitorโ of their 469-page May 18, 2006 submission.  (See May 18, 2006\nSubmission (Doc. No. 820)); (Pls. Reply at 6 (Doc. No. 872).)  There were multiple\ndefense attorneys, though, and Plaintiffs do not state how many courtesy copies they\ngenerated.  Plaintiffs add also that they โroutinely distributed copies of court orders,\nMonitorโs reports and pleadings to various Alabama stakeholders such as families, foster\nfamilies, juvenile judges and services.โ  (Id.)  Moreover, Plaintiffs represent that, during\nmost of the months to which Defendant objected to copying costs, they โwere engaged in\ndiscovery and responding to Defendantโs motions to terminate.โ  (Id.) \nFrom the foregoing, the court finds that Plaintiffs have provided some justification\nfor the photocopying costs, but not justification for the entire requested amount of\n$14,647.90.9  Recognizing that Plaintiffs necessarily incurred some amount of\nphotocopying costs, the court will allow Plaintiffs to recover $500 for each month in\n9  For instance, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that expenditures for providing\ncourtesy copies are reasonable.  (See Pls. Reply at 6 (Doc. No. 872).)  Indeed, the\ncourtesy copies the court received in this case were very helpful.  The court, thus, is not\npersuaded by Defendantโs argument that the courtโs electronic filing system renders any\nphotocopying expenses for courtesy copies excessive.\n18\n\nwhich Plaintiffs billed charges exceeding $500 to which Defendant objected, $500 being\nthe amount to which Defendant has agreed, as set out above.10  During the relevant time\nperiod, there are nine objected-to months in which photocopying expenses exceeded\n$500, meaning that Plaintiffs can recover photocopying expenses during the disputed\nperiod in the amount of $4,500.  \nRelatedly, Defendant argues that Plaintiffsโ rental of two copiers in 2006 to assist\nPlaintiffs in conducting the SEBD review in Jefferson County is unreasonable because\nDHR offered an alternative to Plaintiffs, that is, to provide a clerical worker who would\nmake a โlimited number of copiesโ for Plaintiffs.  (Def. Resp. at 11-12 (Doc. No. 870));\n(Pls. Ex. D-35.)  The court, though, cannot say that Plaintiffsโ decision to reject\nDefendantโs offer of providing โlimitedโ copies was unwarranted, and, under the\nparticular circumstances, the court finds that the expense for renting copiers is\nreasonable.  The disputed $521.91 for copier rentals, therefore, is recoverable.  \nIn sum, the court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover as reasonable expenses\n(1) $15,468.75 for expert fees, (2) $508.03 for computer research, (3) $5,967.83 for\ntravel expenses, and (4) $5,021.91 for photocopying and copier rentals.  The recoverable\nexpenses total $26,966.52.  The remainder of the expenses claimed by Plaintiffs is not\nrecoverable.  \n10 The court notes that its calculation is different from the one urged by Plaintiffs.\n(See Pls. Reply at 6 (Doc. No. 872).)\n19\n\nIV.

The consent decree at issue was\nentered into between the Class and the Alabama Department of Human Resources\n(\"DHR\") in 1991, and later revised in 1999. In 2004, the State sought termination\nof the decree but was unsuccessful. In January of 2007, the district court, after a\nlengthy discovery period but without holding an evidentiary hearing, granted\nDHR's renewed motion for termination. The Class now appeals (1) the court's\nfailure to grant the Class an evidentiary hearing prior to termination and (2) the\ncourt's termination of the consent decree. We find no abuse of discretion in the\ndistrict court's rulings below.\nThe parties are familiar with the facts, and this case has also been the subject\nof two recent published district court opinions, see R.C. v. Walley, 475 F. Supp. 2d\n1118 (M.D. Ala. 2007) [hereinafter R.C. II], and R.C. v. Walley, 390 F. Supp. 2d\n1030 (M.D. Ala. 2005). The Middle District of Alabama has nurtured this\ninstitutional reform case for the better part of two decades, first under Judge Hobbs\nand since the mid-nineties under Judge DeMent. The significant improvement of\nAlabama's child welfare system over the last twenty years is as much a testament to\nthe exemplaiy judicial oversight of these judges as it is to the collaborative efforts\n2\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 6 of 12\nof the parties.\nBesides challenging the termination of the consent decree, the Class's central\nargument on appeal is that the district court should have permitted the Class an\nevidentiary hearing prior to ordering termination of the decree. We review the\ndistrict court's denial of the evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. Loyd v.\nAla. Dep't ofCorrs., 176 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999). This Court does not\nrequire a court to order an evidentiary hearing when there is sufficient evidence\nbefore the court to render a just and equitable determination on the written record.\nSee, e.g., FDIC v. Morley, 915 F.2d 1517, 1522 (11th Cir. 1990) (\"Parties entitled\nto such process cannot, however choose the precise process they desire.\nProcedures providing less than a full evidentiary hearing have often satisfied due\nprocess.\"); United States v. Diaz, 811 F.2d 1412, 1414 (11th Cir. 1987) (finding no\nabuse of discretion when the court denied an evidentiary hearing in bond remission\ncase because \"judge ha{d] all the necessary facts to make a just and equitable\ndetermination of the case\").'\nThe Class argues that under Loyd v. Ala. Dep't of Corrs., 176 F.3d 1336 (11th\nCir. 1999), and Cason v. Seckinger, 231 F.3d 777 (11th Cir. 2000), the district court had an\nobligation to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Both of these cases were decided under the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(b)(2)-(3) (2006). Both are factually and legally\ndistinguishable and do not hold, as Appellants assert, that a district court must order an\nevidentiary hearing prior to the termination of gy consent decree. In Loyd, the only evidence\nupon which the district court relied to make its determination was that submitted by the court\nmonitor. Loyd, 176 F.3d at 1342 (noting that court monitor had submitted eleven reports to the\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 7 of 12\nThe State filed its second motion to terminate the consent decree in August\nof 2005, to which the plaintiffs responded with a brief and evidentiary support.\nThe court formally reopened discovery following the motion to terminate, during\nwhich time the defendants produced more than 50,000 documents, the plaintiffs\ntook three depositions,2 and there were two court monitor reports submitted to the\ncourt. Further, the consent decree itself required that the Class have access to any\nand all data and records it might need to represent the Class in the litigation. The\ndistrict court had confelTed with the parties, permitted introduction of evidence,\nand issued a published opinion on the veiy same issues that were before the court\nin the State's second motion to terminate. This case does not present a situation\nwhere the plaintiff was denied, in any real sense, a meaningful opportunity to\nintroduce evidence before the court or to be heard. The district court's exhaustive,\ndetailed, and thorough opinion emphasizes that it reached the decision to terminate\nafter a review of all evidence submitted to it for consideration.\nMoreover, on May 8, 2006, after the introduction of the foregoing evidence,\ncourt but not mentioning any evidence submitted by plaintiff who opposed termination). In\nCason, in an even more problematic situation, the lower court \"refused to accept\" evidence\nproffered by the class to demonstrate ongoing violations of federal law. Cason, 231 F.3d at 782.\nHere, the court accepted and considered all the evidence before it, including extensive proffers by\nthe Class itself\nThe Class could have sought leave to depose additional individuals but failed to\nmake such a request to the district court.\n4\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 8 of 12\nthe district court ordered that the Class, if desired, may file a brief on or before\nMay 18, 2006, that the State may file a reply thereto on or before May 25, 2006,\nafter which the district court would take the matter under consideration, and further\nargument and evidence would not be permitted. In that May 8, 2006, order, the\ncourt expressly indicated that its ruling on the motion to terminate would not\nrequire a status conference or oral presentation. The class did file a brief on May\n18, 2006, and did make a further evidentiary submission. However, although it\nwas clear that the district court intended to resolve the matter without an\nevidentiary hearing,3 the Class failed to object thereto, failed to otherwise object to\nthe procedures employed by the district court, and failed to seek further depositions\nor opportunities to adduce evidence before the district court ruled.4 Finally, at oral\nargument before this court, counsel was unable to point to any particular evidence\nor argument that the Class was denied an opportunity to present to the district court\nIn Docket number 828, the Class expressly acknowledged its understanding of the\ndistrict court's May 8, 2006, order as stating that \"there will be no status conference or\nevidentiary hearing on this matter.\" Nevertheless, the Class interposed no objection.\nIn its reply brief to, and at oral argument before, this Court, the Class asserted that\nits May 18, 2006, brief did generally refer to and incorporate its prior briefing, which, the Class\nasserts, did request an evidentiary hearing. Our review of that May 18, 2006, brief reveals that it\ndid make a general reference to and incorporation of a previous brief in November, 2005\n(Docket 781). We note, however, that Docket 781 did not request an evidentiary hearing. In any\nevent, in light of the district court's express indication of an intent to rule without an evidentiary\nhearing, we readily conclude that the Class failed to fairly apprise the district court of any\nobjection to the district court's intention of ruling without an evidentiary hearing.\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 9 of 12\nin the seventeen months between the determination motion and the court's ruling.\nBecause the Class was given ample and multiple opportunities to present\nevidence and make arguments to the court, had the right to conduct extensive\ninvestigations and discovery under the court's order and by the terms of the consent\ndecree, had notice of the court's intent to rule without a hearing but failed to raise a\nspecific objection to this procedure, and fails now to point clearly to material\nfactual disputes in the record that could have made a hearing valuable,5 we find no\nabuse of discretion in the court's rendering its decision on the extensive paper\nrecord before it, especially in light of the court's longstanding relationship with the\nparties and this case.\nWe also review the decision to terminate a consent decree for abuse of\ndiscretion. Johnson v. Florida, 348 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir. 2003). In Judge\nDeMent's meticulous 148-page order, he exhaustively reviewed factors counseling\nfor and against termination and ultimately decided that after eighteen years of\nsupervision, the Alabama child welfare system had undergone radical changes and\nwas on secure footing to continue its progress in the years to come, without court\nThe district court observed that throughout the litigation, \"the facts and data rarely\nhave been in dispute, as the issues largely have focused on whether those facts and data legally\nare sufficient to fulfill Defendant's burden under the Consent Decree.\" R.C. 11, 475 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1129 n.h.\n6\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 10 of 12\nsupervision. The system is not yet perfect and may never be, but its improvement\nhas been tremendous. Although it is true, as the Class notes on appeal, that the\ncourt recognized some present deficiencies in the system, these deficiencies alone\ndo not require continuation of the consent decree. The district court was within the\nbounds of its discretion to terminate the decree, having made extensive findings\nand employing the proper legal framework to analyze the termination requirements.\nFurthermore, the district court was in the unique position to rely on its personal\nexperience with the parties and its knowledge of this case to emphasize the State's\nhistory of good faith and its present commitment to remedying remaining problems\nas mitigating factors when assessing substantial compliance and sustainability\nthereof. See Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 394, 112 S.\nCt. 748, 765 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"Our deference to\nthe District Court's exercise of its discretion is heightened where, as in this\nlitigation, the District Court has effectively been overseeing a large public\ninstitution over a long period of time.\"). We accordingly discern no abuse of\ndiscretion in the district court's decision to terminate the consent decree.\nWe are mindful that \"[fjederal courts should not be in the business of\nrunning important functions of state government for decades at a time.\" Reynolds\nv. Mclnnes, 338 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir. 2003). It is, as the district court\n7\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 873   Filed 04/29/08   Page 11 of 12\nconcluded, time for the federal court to step aside and allow the State to continue\nits efforts to care for the Alabama children in its protection.

INTRODUCTION\nBefore the court is a motion for dismissal and termination of the Consent Decree\nwhich has governed in the case since 1991.  (Doc. No. 714.)  The motion which is\naccompanied by a memorandum brief (Doc. No. 715) was filed by the Honorable Page\nWalley, the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Human Resources (โDHRโ). \nThe motion is opposed by Plaintiffs.  (Doc. Nos. 717, 736.)\nAlmost seventeen years ago, on November 15, 1988, this class action lawsuit was\ncommenced on behalf of a minor who is known by his initials โR.C.โ  When the lawsuit\nwas filed, R.C. was an eight-year-old boy who allegedly had been abused by his mother\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 2 of 60 \nand later neglected by his father.  Ultimately, R.C. was placed in the custody of DHR. \n(Compl. at 1-4 (Doc. No. 1).)\nWhile in the custody of DHR, R.Cโs welfare allegedly was not much better than it\nwas when he lived with his parents.  R.C. was subjected to a series of short-term\nplacements, including confinement in psychiatric hospitals.  It was alleged that R.C. was\nheavily medicated with psychotropic drugs and denied visitation with his father. \nEventually, R.C. was placed in a long-term residential treatment facility many miles from\nhome.  (Id. at 5-6.) \nR.C.โs plight was alleged to be symbolic of the fate of numerous other children\nunder the care of DHR.  R.C., on behalf of a class, alleged that the conditions and\npractices in the child welfare system in Alabama were constitutionally deplorable and in\nviolation of federal statutes.  Through class certification, R.C. sought to alleviate these\nsystemic deprivations within DHRโs child welfare system.  (Am. Compl. at 16 (Doc. No.\n22).)  R.C., whose class ultimately was certified by the court, represents a class of\nchildren with diagnosed or perceived emotional or behavioral disorders who are in foster\ncare or DHR custody or who are at imminent risk of placement with DHR.  (Order (Doc.\nNo. 73); Order (Doc. No. 130).)\nTwo years into the lawsuit, the parties negotiated a settlement in the form of a\nConsent Decree which was approved by the court in December 1991.  (Consent Decree,\nentered June 11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235); (Order approving Consent Decree, entered Dec.\n18, 1991 (Doc. No. 252).)  The Consent Decree averted litigation which DHR conceded\n2\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 3 of 60 \nwould have resulted in โa clear victory for the plaintiffsโ and exposed โdevastatingโ\nfacts.1  The initials โR.C.โ now have become synonymous with this Consent Decree\nwhich has been the catalyst for the overhaul and reform of DHRโs child welfare system.  \nAt the core of the Consent Decree is the mandate that DHR reform Alabamaโs\nchild welfare system by developing a โsystem of careโ which operates with the aim of\nachieving specified โgoalsโ and in conformity with thirty โprinciples.โ  (Consent Decree\nยถ 31 (Doc. No. 235).)  Execution of the โsystem of careโ is governed by specific\nstandards and deadlines set forth in the Implementation Plan, also the product of joint\nagreement by the parties.  (Order approving Implementation Plan (Doc. No. 265).)\nTermination of the Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan is provided for in\nparagraph 93 of the Consent Decree, as subsequently amended.  (Consent Decree ยถ 93,\nentered June 11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235), as amended by ยถ 10 of Consent Order Extending\nTime for Compliance at 3, entered Feb. 11, 1999 (โ1999 Consent Orderโ) (Doc. No.\n511).)  Placing the burden on Defendant, the termination clause states that\n[o]n or after October 1, 2002, the defendant may move for termination of\nthis Decree upon a showing that DHR is in substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the Decree and of the Implementation Plan and that DHR\nwill remain in substantial compliance after termination of the injunction in\nthis case.\n  \n(Id.) \n1 R.C. v. Nachman, 969 F. Supp. 682, 686 (M.D. Ala. 1997), affโd, 145 F.3d 363\n(11th Cir. 1998).\n3\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 4 of 60 \nHaving presided over the implementation of the Consent Decree for nine years,\nwith the skilled assistance of the court monitor, the undersigned has an intimate\nunderstanding of the history and circumstances of this litigation.2  The undersigned also is\nvery familiar with all facets of the Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan,\nincluding the purposes, provisions, and procedures set out therein, as well as with the\nprogress made to date and the obstacles encountered along the way.   \nDefendant has made great progress and marked improvements in DHRโs child\nwelfare system, including but not limited to its staffing directives, its educational\nrequirements for employees, its funding and its overall day-to-day functions.  The court\nalso commends Defendant for DHRโs ability and willingness to respond immediately to\nany complaint concerning child safety, as well as to cooperate with municipal, county and\nstate law enforcement in all matters pertaining to child endangerment and the prevention\nof the same.  Moreover, the court recognizes Defendantโs recent good faith efforts to\ncomply with the requirements of the Consent Decree, to include Defendantโs prompt\nresponse to the issues enumerated by the court at the December 2004 status conference.\nNotwithstanding the exceptional strides by Defendant, the parties entered into a\nvoluntary agreement in which they, not the court, set out the governing standards for\ncompliance and the provision for termination of the Consent Decree.  While the court is\n2 Originally, the Honorable Truman M. Hobbs, now Senior United States District\nJudge for the Middle District of Alabama, presided over this case.  The undersigned\ninherited this case in April 1996.\n4\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 5 of 60 \never mindful that consent decrees are โnot intended to operate in perpetuity,โ Board of\nEducation v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248 (1991), termination is premature until such time\nthat Defendant has sustained his twofold burden of showing substantial compliance.\nHaving carefully considered the arguments of counsel, the relevant law and the\nrecord as a whole, the court finds that Defendant has not submitted evidence sufficient to\nsustain his burden of demonstrating that DHR โisโ and โwill remainโ in substantial\ncompliance with the terms of the Consent Decree and of the Implementation Plan as\nrequired for termination of said Decree.3  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, as amended by 1999\nConsent Order.)  Defendantโs motion, therefore, is due to be denied at this time.4\n  \nII.  JURISDICTION\nThe Consent Decreeโs provisions bestow upon the court the power to resolve\ndisputed matters, shared authority with the court monitor to determine compliance with\n3 The court emphasizes that its findings herein are the product of very serious\nconsideration and deliberation.  As the court has stated previously, the court is\nconstitutionally committed, as it should be, to safeguarding the abused and neglected\nchildren for whom the Consent Decree provides protection.  See R.C., 969 F. Supp.\nat 688, 705 & n.18.\n4 The court finds that the present record is factually adequate for resolving the\ninstant matter without the need for a hearing.  The briefs and arguments clearly set forth\nthe partiesโ respective positions and the evidence upon which the parties rely, and\nDefendant has not demonstrated how an evidentiary hearing would add anything of\nmaterial value to the record. \n5\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 6 of 60 \nthe Consent Decree, and sole authority to terminate the Consent Decree upon motion of\nDefendant.  (Consent Decree ยถยถ 86, 91, 93, as amended by 1999 Consent Order.) \nNot only is the courtโs jurisdiction over this matter explicitly set out in the Consent\nDecree, but also is implicit in the courtโs inherent jurisdiction over its decrees.  See\nVanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013, 1018 (6th Cir. 1994); Berger\nv. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir. 1985) (โConsent decrees are subject to\ncontinuing supervision and enforcement by the court.โ).  The court, thus, finds that it acts\nwithin its jurisdiction in ruling on the present motion to terminate the Consent Decree.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nThe Consent Decree, filed in June 1991, is the product of extensive negotiations\nand bargaining which occurred between the parties during the weeks preceding the\nscheduled trial date in this case.  (Consent Decree (Doc. No. 235).)  In December 1991,\nafter independent consideration, the court approved the Consent Decree, finding that it\nwas fair, adequate and reasonable.  (Order approving Consent Decree (Doc. No. 252).)\nThe Consent Decree contemplated that the parties initially would evaluate DHRโs\nchild welfare system to determine its resources, capabilities and needs.  Thereafter, the\nConsent Decree provided that DHR would develop an โImplementation Planโ through\nwhich DHR would incorporate into its child welfare system the goals and principles of\nthe Consent Decree within specified timetables.  (Consent Decree ยถยถ 64-68 (Doc. No.\n6\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 7 of 60 \n235).)  An Implementation Plan ultimately was approved by the court on November 1,\n1993.  (Order approving Implementation Plan (Doc. No. 265).)\nDue to the extent of reforms necessary to implement the Consent Decree, the\nImplementation Plan called for the phased-in โconversionโ of Alabamaโs sixty-seven\ncounties.  Each year, for seven consecutive years, specified counties were to be\nโconvertedโ until all counties were functioning in compliance with the Consent Decree. \nThe Implementation Plan was to be completed by October 1999, at which time the\nConsent Decree provided that Defendant could move for termination upon a showing of\nDHRโs substantial compliance, both present and future, with the terms of the Consent\nDecree and the Implementation Plan.  (See Consent Decree ยถ 93 (footnote omitted) (Doc.\nNo. 235).)  \nThe Consent Decree also mandated the appointment of an independent court\nmonitor who would serve as the courtโs agent and oversee and assist in the\nimplementation process.  (Id. ยถยถ 75-82.)  On March 17, 1993, by agreement of the parties,\nthe court appointed Dr. Ivor D. Groves, Ph.D., as the monitor in this lawsuit.  (Doc. No.\n260.)  The courtโs five-page โorder appointing monitorโ sets out the monitorโs roles and\nresponsibilities which include assessing DHRโs compliance with the Consent Decree and\nImplementation Plan, apprizing the court and the parties of DHRโs progress, and\nmediating disputes between the parties.  (Id.)  Among other provisions, the order also\ndictates that the court monitor shall have access to all needed information, establishes\nguidelines for compensating the court monitor, authorizes the court monitor to hire staff,\n7\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 8 of 60 \nand permits the court monitor to engage in ex parte communications with the parties and\nthe court.  (Id.; see also Doc. No. 259, Ex. 2 (Contract at 7).) \nDr. Groves has remained the court monitor for the duration of this case.  He has\nbeen instrumental in the conversion process of each of Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties\nand has greatly assisted the court and the parties. \nWith the court monitorโs assistance, the parties began the implementation of the\nConsent Decree.  In August 1996, pursuant to the authority bestowed upon him in the\nConsent Decree,5 the court monitor determined that the first county to be in compliance\nwith the requirements of the Consent Decree was Shelby County.  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 6.)  The conversion process for each county generally is described by the\ncourt monitor in his November 2004 Report from which the court quotes:\nIn order to be determined converted to practice that conforms to the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree, each county has been required to\ndemonstrate that child welfare services are being consistently provided in\naccordance with the operating principles of the decree. . . .\nA county-by-county review process was followed that included the\nfollowing steps.  The first step was that either the monitor or the Family\nServices Partnershipโs Office of Quality Assurance conducted a review of a\nsample of randomly chosen children and families and a series of focus\ngroups were conducted with key stakeholders such as family court judges,\n5 Paragraph 86 of the Consent Decree provides that โ[o]nly this Court, the monitor,\nor another person or entity appointed by the Court shall have the authority to determine\ncompliance with this decree.โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 86.)  The court has not exercised the\nprovision which permits it to appoint another person or entity.  Also, since the inception\nof the Consent Decree, the court has permitted the court monitor to make determinations\nof compliance and to report the same to the court after a county asserts that it has\nimplemented the required system of care.  It is notable that neither party ever has filed an\nobjection with the court on the basis of such determinations made by the court monitor.\n8\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 9 of 60 \nservice providers, guardian ad litems, caseworkers, quality assurance\ncommittee members, and DHR county management.  Upon reaching an\nacceptable level of performance, based on the child in-depth reviews,\nquantitative performance, and stakeholder input, the second step was to\nโreleaseโ the county to present the overall set of data and community\npartner perspectives that support an assertion of conversion of practice to\ncompliance with the principles of the Consent Decree.  Following the\nassertion presentation attended by both the monitor and the plaintiffโs\ncounsel, an independent review by the plaintiffโs attorneys was conducted\nin order to further assess compliance with practice expectations.  Lastly, the\nmonitor reviewed all available information gained through these review\nactivities and made a final determination of a countyโs compliance status. \nThis compliance determination process has been utilized for all counties.\n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 7 (see infra footnote 7).)  The court monitor explains,\nin general terms, that he declares a county converted โwhen 85% of child status and\nsystem performance ratings are acceptable during an on-site compliance [review].โ  (Id.\nat 25.)  \nAlthough between August 1996 and the end of 1998, the court monitor determined\nthat fourteen counties, in addition to Shelby County, had โconvertedโ their child welfare\npractices in accordance with the terms of the Consent Decree, it became clear that DHR\nwould not be able to meet the October 1999 deadline set out in the Consent Decree.  The\nparties, however, averted litigation and negotiated an agreed-upon two-year extension of\nthe conversion deadline to October 1, 2002.  Based on the agreement of the parties, the\ncourt entered the detailed 1999 Consent Order.6  (1999 Consent Order (Doc. No. 511); Ct.\n6 The 1999 Consent Order noted that among the reasons for Defendantโs non-\ncompliance were as follows: lack of trained staff; failure to keep pace with the mandated\nschedule for conversion; hiring freezes; and restrictions on the availability of flex funds. \n9\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 10 of 60 \nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 5.)  Its provisions specified that the final county would be\nconverted by October 1, 2001, and that, during the ensuing year (until October 1, 2002),\nDHR would demonstrate that the counties were sustaining their conversions.  (Doc. No.\n511, Ex. 2 (โStrategic Conversion Planโ at 9); Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 29.) \nContemplating full compliance by October 1, 2002, the parties modified the termination\nprovision of the Consent Decree to provide as follows:  \nOn or after October 1, 2002, the defendant may move for termination of this\nDecree upon a showing that DHR is in substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the Decree and of the Implementation Plan and that DHR\nwill remain in substantial compliance after termination of the injunction in\nthis case.\n(1999 Consent Order ยถ 10.)7\nAlso, during this time frame, to assist in the implementation of the Consent\nDecree, the court entered two orders, one governing caseload standards and the other\ngoverning licensing of staff.  (Doc. Nos. 452, 538.)  These orders were submitted as\nproposed joint orders, like the majority of orders entered in this case.  The overall\nobjective of the 1998 order on caseload standards is to restrict the number of cases\nassigned to social workers so that caseloads remain manageable.  Also, in a separate\norder, the court directed Defendant to establish a policy governing licensing requirements\n7 In addition to extending the time for compliance, the amended termination\nparagraph deleted the words โreasonable prospectโ from the last clause.  The original\ntermination provision provided in the concluding clause that โthe defendant may move for\ntermination of this decree upon a showing . . . that there is a reasonable prospect that he\nwill remain in substantial compliance.โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 93.)\n10\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 11 of 60 \nfor new social workers as a way to help ensure that DHR recruits the quality workers\nneeded to implement the Consent Decree.  (Doc. No. 538.)  In December 1999, DHR\nfinalized the latter policy, and the court approved it on January 1, 2000.  (Id.)  The policy,\nin sum and substance, created a new entry-level classification for social workers and\nprovided that DHR would only hire applicants for this classification who had earned a\nBachelor of Social Work.  (Id.)  The policy also implemented incentives for existing staff\nto obtain professional social work degrees, such as providing educational leave with pay. \n(Id.)     \nNotwithstanding the progress DHR was making as to county conversion and the\nefforts of DHR to improve caseload management and the quality of its workforce, the\nOctober 2002 goal for full conversion ultimately proved unrealizable.  As of October\n2002, seventeen counties still had not completed the conversion process and had not\nattained a favorable declaration of compliance from the court monitor.  At a status\nconference held by the court on October 29, 2002, it was acknowledged that, although\nDefendant had โmade significant progress in implementing the Consent Decreeโ and had\nfor the preceding โtwo years demonstrated good faith in his diligent efforts to comply\nwith the Orders of this Court,โ implementation of the system of care in all counties was\nnot complete.  (Mem. of Understanding, entered Dec. 5, 2002 (Doc. No. 650); see also\nDoc. No. 645 (minutes from status conference).)  At the status conference, the court\nmonitor stated that he anticipated that it would take an additional six to nine months for\nthe remaining counties to attain compliance with the Consent Decree and that, thereafter,\n11\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 12 of 60 \nfor one year, a monitoring process would commence for the purpose of assessing DHRโs\nability to remain in compliance.  (Doc. No. 645.)\nAfter this status conference, the parties filed a Memorandum of Understanding,\ncited above.  Therein, a new deadline was not set for the conversion of all counties;\ninstead, the parties agreed that Defendant would โcontinue his diligent efforts to comply\nwith orders of this Court in a timely mannerโ and that the parties would work toward\nachieving substantial compliance as quickly as possible.  (Mem. of Understanding,\nentered Dec. 5, 2002 (Doc. No. 650).)\nSince December 2002, the court has held several status conferences to resolve\ndisputed issues and to assess the progress being made.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 663 (minutes\nfrom May 1, 2003 status conference); Doc. No. 670 (order setting June 12, 2003 status\nconference); Doc. No. 681 (minutes from August 26, 2003 hearing); Doc. No. 692\n(minutes from Feb. 3, 2004 status conference).)  At the request of the parties, the court\nalso entered an order on November 5, 2003, to assist in the final phases of the conversion\nprocess.  The order, among others things, dictated that, โ[i]n connection with DHRโs\nsustainability reviews of converted counties, the Defendant will develop and implement a\nreport card or similar mechanism for publicly asserting and rating the quality of each\ncountyโs practice.โ  (Order (Doc. No. 687).)  As further agreed by the parties, the order\nalso streamlined the process for the conversion of the remaining counties.  The order set\ndeadlines for Defendant, Plaintiffs and the court monitor so that, once a county asserted\nthat it was operating within the parameters of the Consent Decree, the parties would\n12\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 13 of 60 \nreceive written notification from the court monitor within forty-five days as to whether\nthe county had attained the goal of conversion.  (Id.)\nIn October 2004, with only four counties remaining for conversion approval by the\ncourt monitor, the court entered an order setting a status conference for December 9,\n2004.  The court directed that counsel for Plaintiffs, counsel for Defendant and the court\nmonitor be present.  In the same order, the court ordered the court monitor to file a status\nreport concerning Defendantโs โcompliance with the terms of the Consent Decree.โ  (Doc.\nNo. 711 at 1.)  The court indicated that the court monitor could make any\nrecommendations he deemed appropriate.  (Id.)  Furthermore, the court set a deadline by\nwhich counsel for Plaintiffs and Defendant were to file briefs, setting forth their\nrespective positions as to whether Defendant had met his burden of demonstrating\nsubstantial compliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree.  (Id. at 1-2.)  The\ncourt also invited counsel to include in their briefs any comments concerning the court\nmonitorโs report.  (Id. at 2.)  \nComplying with the courtโs order, the court monitor submitted a 61-page report,\ntitled โFinal Report on Implementation of the R.C. vs. Walley Consent Decree,โ dated\nNovember 2004 (โCt. Monitor Nov. 2004 Reportโ).8  The court monitorโs ultimate\nrecommendations are contained on pages 60 and 61 of said Report where the court\nmonitor states as follows:\n8 The court monitorโs November 2004 Report was introduced in evidence at the\nDecember 9, 2004 status conference.  (See Doc. No. 723, minute entry.)\n13\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 14 of 60 \nThe monitor does not find that DHR has fully fulfilled the promise that was\nshown in the exemplary performance demonstrated by the many counties\nand, particularly, the early counties that were determined โconverted.โ \nThese performance levels demonstrated virtually 100% compliance with the\nDecree and the best child welfare practice in the country.\n1.  The monitor does find, however, that the current performance levels are\nadequate and recommends that the court find that DHR is in substantial\ncompliance with the Consent Decree.\n2.  It is recommended that the independent monitoring of the Consent\nDecree be terminated.\n3.  It is recommended that the court require that DHR produce at least two\nperformance reports over the next 12 months to be submitted to the court\nthat contain facts addressing the same areas of performance as the monitorโs\nreport.  The reports should also include the county ratings ordered by the\ncourt.  The reports should demonstrate that resources are being maintained,\nthat performance improvements are continuing to be made, and that\nongoing protective supervision and family engagement are being\nstrengthened.  \n(Id. at 60-61.) \nIn response to the court monitorโs November 2004 Report, Plaintiffs filed a brief,\npresenting, through argument and expert affidavit testimony, their position that the\ninformation in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report demonstrates substantial โnon-\ncompliance.โ  (Doc. No. 717.)  Defendant simultaneously filed the instant โmotion for\norder terminating consent decree and dismissing case,โ invoking the termination clause of\nthe Consent Decree.  (Doc. Nos. 714-715.)  Therein, Defendant asserts that DHR is โin\nsubstantial compliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree and of the\nImplementation Plan and is likely to remain in substantial compliance.โ  (Id. at 1, ยถ 2.) \nAs grounds, Defendant relies primarily on the court monitorโs November 2004 Report\n14\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 15 of 60 \nand the recommendations therein, arguing that DHR has implemented the system of care\nin all sixty-seven counties in the State and has formulated a sustainability plan โto assure\ncompliance with the principles of the Consent Decree in the future.โ  (Id. at 2.) \nDefendant attached the sustainability plan as an exhibit to his motion.  (Ex. to Doc. No.\n714.) \nThe sustainability plan to which Defendant refers is titled โChild Welfare Strategic\nPlanโ (โStrategic Planโ).  DHR implemented the Strategic Plan in May 2004 and updated\nit in September 2004.  (Id.)  Given Defendantโs reliance on the recent formulation of this\nStrategic Plan and the courtโs recognition that the Strategic Plan is an indicator of DHRโs\ngood faith commitment to conforming child welfare practices to the goals and principles\nof the Consent Decree, more discussion as to this Plan is warranted.  \nThe Strategic Planโs prologue states, in part, that DHR desires โto constantly strive\nfor even better performance. . . .  To that end, DHR presents an organizational plan for\npost-R.C. [practice].โ9  (Id.)  The multifaceted functions of the Strategic Plan are outlined\nin the court monitorโs November 2004 Report at pages 54 through 58, and, as stated, the\nentire plan is attached as an exhibit to document number 714.  (Id. at 54-58; Ex. to Doc.\nNo. 714.)  The Strategic Plan addresses issues relating to:  staffing and caseload\nmanagement; recruitment and retention of qualified staff and ongoing professional\n9 As observed by the court monitor, โ[t]he intent of this plan is to continue some of\nthe initiatives developed during the duration of R.C., as well as to outline and implement\nadditional strategies to continue improvement of the quality and consistency of child\nwelfare practice.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 54.)  \n15\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 16 of 60 \ndevelopment initiatives, including a reconfigured โchild welfare consultation modelโ;\nstrategies to improve permanency for children in out-of-home care; quality assurance;\ninformation systems development; and finance.  \nRegarding staffing and caseload management, DHR has established a โstaffing\ncommitteeโ which meets โregularlyโ for the primary purpose of monitoring staff-to-\ncaseload ratios.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 55.)  The staffing committee reviews\ncounty directorsโ requests for additional personnel and incorporates county consultant\nupdates regarding county staffing needs.  Also, in order to recruit and retain qualified and\nlicensed social workers and to comply with the courtโs order on licensing standards, (see\nDoc. No. 538), DHR developed a Staff Development Office in 2001.  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 55.)  \nIn the area of professional development, the Strategic Plan sets outs the various\ntraining programs which DHR offers for its social workers, many through national\nresource centers.  (Id. at 56-57.)  Another โmajorโ initiative of the Strategic Plan related\nto professional development is the refinement of DHRโs child welfare consultation model. \n(Id. at 56.)  The goals of the consultation model are to employ full-time consultants who\ncan assess countiesโ needs and quality of practice based on onsite evaluation and\navailable data and provide follow-up actions.  (Id.)  \nThe Strategic Plan also describes specific steps to be taken by DHR at the state and\ncounty level to improve the attainment of permanency for children receiving foster care\nservices.  (Id. at 57.)  Also, addressed are strategies to improve DHRโs ability to meet the\n16\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 17 of 60 \nneeds of severely emotionally disturbed (โSEDโ) children, including the establishment of\na statewide database to track the status of SED children and additional training for staff\nregarding intervention strategies and techniques to address the needs of these children. \n(Id.)  Finally, the Strategic Plan emphasizes that DHR is committed to continuing, and\neven increasing, quality assurance mechanisms by which DHR evaluates each countyโs\nchild welfare practice.  (Id. at 58.)\nAfter reviewing the pleadings submitted by Plaintiffs and Defendant and the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report, on December 9, 2004, the court held a status\nconference in chambers at which time counsel for Plaintiffs and Defendant and the\nCommissioner of DHR articulated their positions as to whether DHR had attained the\ngoal of substantial compliance so that federal oversight can end.10   \nAfter careful consideration of the issues and arguments presented by the parties\nand the court monitor at the status conference, the court entered an order on December\n13, 2004.  (Doc. No. 725.)  Although recognizing the โmonumental stridesโ and โgreat\nsuccessโ in this case, the court declined to terminate the Consent Decree at that time and\n10 The court was honored to have in attendance at the status conference Governor\nBob Riley.  The court applauds the Governorโs commitment to the State of Alabamaโs\nchild welfare system.  \nThe court also notes that it is particularly impressed with the fact that, pursuant to \nan executive order, at the conclusion of this case, the Governor will appoint a blue-ribbon\ncommission for a period of time for the purpose of overseeing DHRโs child welfare\nsystem.  When the commission commences to operate, the court strongly recommends\nthat it inspect, instead of expect.  Continual inspection, encouragement and praise are\nrequired of any organization this large and this important.   \n17\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 18 of 60 \nheld Defendantโs motion under advisement.  The court found that, at a minimum, four\ndeficiencies outlined in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report were barriers to a\nfinding of substantial compliance.  (Id. at 2.)\nThe court summarized the four โproblem areasโ as follows:  (1) Defendant has not\nimplemented into sanctioned DHR policy the 1998 court-ordered caseload standards.  \n(See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 55 (recommending that โDHR maintain the 1998\nCourt Order of Caseloads and Staffing by implementing policy measures to ensure\ncurrent staff-to-caseload ratios are continuedโ)); (2) Defendant never has complied with\nthe courtโs November 4, 2003 Order which directed DHR to establish a mechanism to\nprovide regular โreport cardsโ describing the status of each countyโs performance with\nrespect to the Consent Decree.  (See Nov. 4, 2003 Order which provides:  โIn connection\nwith DHRโs sustainability reviews of converted counties, the Defendant will develop and\nimplement a report card or similar mechanism for publicly asserting and rating the quality\nof each countyโs practice.โ); (3) Despite significant progress, Jefferson County which has\nfive regions and the largest percentage of children in DHRโs care manifests certain\nweaknesses which impede its ability to sustain substantial compliance (see, e.g., Doc. No.\n717 at 11-13); and (4) the court monitor has not yet declared Baldwin County in\ncompliance with the principles of the Consent Decree.  (Ct. Dec. 13, 2004 Order (Doc.\nNo. 725).)\nConsistent with the partiesโ prior practices, the parties agreed to meet and confer\nfor the purpose of reaching a mutually satisfactory solution to each of the four areas\n18\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 19 of 60 \nabove.11  (Id.)  The court gave the parties a deadline of January 21, 2005, to confer jointly\nand formulate a detailed written plan focused on strategies to rectify the above\ndeficiencies and to file a joint statement.12  Upon the request of the parties, the court\nextended that deadline to February 4, 2005.  (Doc. No. 731.)\nOn February 4, 2005, unable to reach a joint resolution, Plaintiffs and Defendant\nfiled separate reports with the court.  Defendant noted that the parties and the court\nmonitor had five discussions, in person and by telephone, including one meeting with\nGovernor Bob Riley, for the purposes of resolving the issues outlined in the courtโs\n11 It was the opinion of the court that the parties should address any other matters\ndiscovered during careful perusal of the entire case.\n12 Specifically, the court directed that the joint statement include particulars\nregarding the following:  (1) the inclusion of the 1998 court-ordered caseload standards in\nofficial DHR policy; (2) a mutually agreed-upon report card or similar mechanism for\npublicly asserting and rating the quality of each countyโs practice; (3) the particular\ncompliance problems with and the unique needs of Jefferson County and the specific\nmethods DHR will implement to ensure adequate performance in the future in Jefferson\nCounty; and (4) the status of Baldwin Countyโs conversion.  (Ct. Dec. 13, 2004 Order\n(Doc. No. 725).)\n19\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 20 of 60 \nDecember 13 Order and reaching an agreement as to how to return Alabama's child\nwelfare system to the State.13   (Doc. No. 735 at 1.)\nIn his report to the court, Defendant communicated the following: (1) that DHR\nhad promulgated an โEmergency Rule,โ ultimately to be included as a permanent rule in\nDHRโs Administrative Code, codifying the 1998 court-ordered caseload standards at\nSection 660-5-53 of the Alabama Administrative Code (see Ex. A to Doc. No. 735);\n(2) that, finally, in compliance with the November 2003 court order, DHR had prepared a\nโreport cardโ rating system to be published twice a year describing the status of each\ncountyโs performance with respect to the Consent Decree (see Ex. B to Doc. No. 735);\nand (3) that DHR had developed a written plan to address performance issues in Jefferson\nCounty. (See Ex. C to Doc. No. 735.)  \n13  At the status conference, the court was aware that, although each county had\ndemonstrated โthe capacity to perform in accordance with the principles of the R.C.\nConsent Decree,โ the actual ability of the counties to sustain substantial compliance after\nconversion was a concern to the court monitor.  (See e.g., Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report\nat 60.)  Given this concern, the court considered issuing an order that day which imposed\nas an express requirement for termination of the Consent Decree that, in addition to\nimplementing a public rating system of county performance as required by court order,\nDefendant must file at least one, if not more, report cards demonstrating DHRโs ability to\nsustain substantial performance.  At the status conference, however, having been\npersuaded by the concerted vocalizations from the Commissioner, counsel for Defendant,\nand the Governor which further demonstrated DHRโs solid commitment to attaining the\ngoal of substantial compliance, the court refrained from directly ordering such a\nrequirement.  The court was hopeful that this case could come to a conclusion, consonant\nwith the partiesโ past practices, based on the conciliatory agreement of the parties,\nwithout further court intervention.  \n20\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 21 of 60 \nAt the time the parties submitted their separate reports to the court (Doc. Nos.\n735-36), the court monitor had not yet declared Baldwin County a โconvertedโ county. \nOn March 11, 2005, however, the court monitor declared that Baldwin County โ the final\nand sixty-seventh county โ โis consistently practicing in accordance with the Consent\nDecree and is declared a converted county.โ  (See Ct. Ex. 1, attached hereto.)\nIV.  DISCUSSION\nThe Consent Decree resulted from the protracted, good-faith bargaining between\nPlaintiffs and Defendant.  It represents the settlement of this litigation between the\nparties.  Implementation of the Consent Decree has been supervised extensively by the\ncourt and the court monitor over the past decade.  The court has had continuing\ninvolvement, through regular communications with the court monitor, status conferences\nand hearings.  With the exception of a brief period in the mid-1990s in which DHR\nimprovidently challenged the validity of the Consent Decree, see, e.g., R.C. v. Nachman,\n969 F. Supp. 682 (M.D. Ala. 1997), affโd, 145 F.3d 363 (11th Cir. 1998), to the credit of\nthe parties, these proceedings have been primarily conciliatory, as opposed to adversarial.\nThis case has evolved from one of contention to one of mediation with both sides exerting\nextensive and commendable efforts to resolve all disputes in the best interest of the\nchildren involved.  \n21\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 22 of 60 \nWith that said, the proceedings have now turned adversarial with Defendant\ninvoking the termination clause of the Consent Decree and Plaintiffs opposing\ntermination.  The termination provision provides as follows:\nOn or after October 1, 2002, the defendant may move for termination of this\nDecree upon a showing that DHR is in substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the Decree and of the Implementation Plan and that DHR\nwill remain in substantial compliance after termination of the injunction in\nthis case.\n(See Consent Decree ยถ 93 (Doc. No. 235), as amended by ยถ 10 of 1999 Consent Order\n(Doc. No. 511).)  By the Consent Decreeโs express terms, Defendant bears the burden of\nestablishing โsubstantial compliance.โ  (Id.)\nDefendant contends that DHR is in substantial compliance with the provisions of\nthe Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan, that โit has the capacity to sustain\ncompliance,โ (Doc. No. 735 at 3), and that it is โlikely to remain in substantial\ncompliance.โ  (Doc. No. 714 at 1.)  Defendant relies primarily on the court monitorโs\nrecent assertion that โcurrent performance levels are adequateโ and the court monitorโs\nrecommendation that โthe court find that DHR is in substantial compliance with the\nConsent Decree.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 60.)  Defendant also tenders that he\nhas resolved the โfour problem areasโ which the court addressed at the December 9, 2004\nstatus conference and that, therefore, the court should โterminate the Consent Decree in\naccordance with its terms.โ  (Doc. No. 735 at 1-3.)  \nAs to present compliance, Defendant asserts that โDHR has established and\nimplemented the required System of Care in all sixty-seven counties of Alabama pursuant\n22\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 23 of 60 \nto an Implementation Plan developed by DHR and approved by the court.โ  (Doc. No.\n715 at 5.)  Furthermore, with no citations to the record and in conclusory fashion,\nDefendant sets forth a bulleted list which he says represents โindicators of DHRโs\noperation of the System of Care with the aim of achieving the goals of the Decree and in\nconformity with the โprinciplesโ or โstandardsโ of the Decree[.]โ  (Id. at 5-6.)   \nAs to the requirement that Defendant demonstrate that DHR will remain in\nsubstantial compliance, Defendant asserts that there is an established record of DHRโs\ngood faith compliance with the provisions of the Consent Decree and the courtโs orders. \nDefendant contends that DHRโs record of good faith is further buttressed by DHRโs\ndiligent and cooperative work with Plaintiffs and the court monitor.  To the extent that\nthere have been โtechnicalโ violations with the โstrict termsโ of the Consent Decree, such\nas the failure of DHR to meet the October 2002 deadline, Defendant asserts that those\nviolations were โunintentionalโ and not โsystematic.โ  (Id. at 7-8.)  \nRelying also on DHRโs โinstitutionalization of procedures,โ Defendant emphasizes\nthat DHR has incorporated into its โoperating policiesโ the standards set forth in the\nConsent Decree and other directives, such as the courtโs order on caseload standards.  (Id.\nat 9.)  Defendant states that DHR has adopted a detailed, written Child Welfare Strategic\nPlan to ensure that the advances made to date remain in place and that improvements\ncontinue.  Finally, Defendant asserts that DHR will publish public reports demonstrating\nDHRโs performance of the Consent Decreeโs system of care.  (Id. at 9-10.)\n23\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 24 of 60 \n     Plaintiffs do not undermine the โstrides the State has made toward fulfilling the\nvision articulated in the R.C. Consent Decree.โ  (Doc. No. 736 at 2.)  Plaintiffs, though,\ncontend that Defendant has not met his burden of demonstrating sustained substantial\ncompliance by DHR.  Plaintiffs have submitted an affidavit from George E. Taylor, M.A.,\na proposed expert, who reviewed various documents in the case, including the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report.  Mr. Taylor does not introduce new data, but, rather,\nanalyzes the court monitorโs November 2004 Report and asserts that the evidence therein\nis incongruent with the court monitorโs final recommendation of substantial compliance. \nMr. Taylor, in sum and substance, complains that the court monitorโs report is conclusory,\nis lacking current data, and that the data demonstrates DHRโs noncompliance and\nregression, not substantial compliance.  (Taylor Aff., Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 717.)  \nA.

A consent decree, therefore, is a โโsettlement agreement\nsubject to continued judicial policing.โโ  Id.  โOnce approved, the prospective provisions\n24\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 25 of 60 \nof the consent decree operate as an injunction.โ  Id. (citing Plumer v. Chemical Bank, 668\nF.2d 654, 659 (2d Cir. 1982)). \nThe decision to terminate jurisdiction over a consent decree rests in the district\ncourtโs discretion.  See Johnson v. Florida, 348 F.3d 1334, 1341, 1349 (11th Cir. 2003);\nMcDonald v. Carnahan, 109 F.3d 1319, 1321 (8th Cir. 1997).  The court, though, when\nproclaiming its decision, should โmake sufficiently detailed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., to advise the parties of the factual\nbasis for its decision.โ  Bradley v. Milliken, 772 F.2d 266, 272 (6th Cir. 1985); see also\nBd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v.

Consideration of the\nspecific terms of the Consent Decree then is paramount.  \nFactors which may be relevant to whether the purposes have been fully achieved\nare:  (1) whether the defendant has complied in good faith with the terms of the consent\ndecree since it was entered; (2) any specific terms providing for continued supervision\nand jurisdiction over the consent decree; (3) the length of time the consent decree has\nbeen in effect; and (4) whether the consent decree has eliminated the constitutional\ndeficiencies โto the extent practicable.โ  Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50; Gonzales v. Galvin,\n151 F.3d 526, 531 (6th Cir. 1998); Cody v. Hillard, 139 F.3d 1197, 1199 (8th Cir. 1998);\nCity of Miami, 2 F.3d at 1505-06; Heath v.

Notwithstanding this list of factors, though, a court may not terminate its\njurisdiction until it finds both compliance with the terms of the consent decree and\nachievement of the decreeโs objectives.  See Gonzales, 151 F.3d at 541. \nHere, the Consent Decree provides that โsubstantial complianceโ is the governing\nstandard for termination.  Under the express terms of the Consent Decree, a dual\nโsubstantial complianceโ inquiry is mandated:  (1) Has Defendant demonstrated that DHR\nis substantially complying with the requirements of the Consent Decree and the\nImplementation Plan?; and (2) has Defendant demonstrated that DHR will remain in\nsubstantial compliance therewith?  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, as amended by 1999 Consent\nOrder.)  To determine whether Defendant has met his burden of demonstrating\n26\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 27 of 60 \nโsubstantial compliance,โ the court must ascertain the meaning of โsubstantial\ncompliance.โ\nPlaintiffs and Defendant, who negotiated the terms of the Consent Decree, agree as\nto the general principles of law surrounding the definition of โsubstantial compliance.โ \nโSubstantial Complianceโ is oft defined by what it is not.  โSubstantial Complianceโ is\nnot subject to rigid application, nor โsusceptible of a mathematically precise definition.โ \nJoseph A. by Wolfe v. N.M Depโt of Human Servs., 69 F.3d 1081, 1085 (10th Cir. 1995). \nSubstantial compliance is not โexact complianceโ or perfection.  Id.; see Wyatt v.\nRodgers, 985 F. Supp. 1356, 1388 (M.D. Ala. 1997) (observing that substantial\ncompliance is something less than 100% compliance; โit would be impractical, and thus\nunreasonable, to expect 100% compliance 100% of the timeโ with respect to the complex\nrequirements of a consent decree).  Rather, whether the goal of substantial compliance\nhas been attained requires a case-specific analysis.  See Fortin v. Commโr of the Depโt of\nMass. Pub. Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 795 (1st Cir. 1982)  (โ[N]o particular percentage of\ncompliance can be a safe-harbor figure, transferable from one context to another.  Like\nreasonableness, substantiality must depend on the circumstances of each case, including\nthe nature of the interest at stake and the degree to which noncompliance affects that\ninterest.โ).  \nIn Joseph A. by Wolfe, relied upon by both Plaintiffs and Defendant, the Tenth\nCircuit set forth some general guidelines as to what โsubstantial complianceโ entails in\nthe context of consent decrees.  In that case, as here, the consent decree provided that\n27\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 28 of 60 \ntermination of the decree was contingent upon a showing by the defendant of substantial\ncompliance with its terms.  See Joseph A. by Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1083.  Because the\ncontract terms imposed the requirement of โsubstantial compliance,โ the Tenth Circuit\napplied the contract law definition.  See id. at 1085; see also Reynolds v. McInnes, 338\nF.3d 1201, 1211 (11th Cir. 2003) (holding that court must โapply the same rules that\ngovern contract interpretation when [it] interpret[s] a consent decree, because a consent\ndecree is essentially a form of contractโ).  The court explained:\n[S]ubstantial compliance is:  โsimply a doctrine to assist the court in\ndetermining whether conduct should, in reality, be considered the\nequivalent of compliance under the contract.โ . . .   Judge Cardozo, in the\nseminal substantial compliance case of Jacob & Youngs, Inc. v. Kent,\nconcluded that performance of a contract will not be considered in\nsubstantial compliance of the contract if the deviation from the contract\nrequirements . . . โin any real substantial measure . . . frustrate[s] the\npurpose of the contract.โโ  230 N.Y. 239, 129 N.E. 889, 891 (1921).  Thus,\nthe touchstone of the substantial compliance inquiry is whether Defendants\nfrustrated the purpose of the consent decreeโi.e. its essential requirements.\nJoseph A. by Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1085-86.  \nIn Joseph A. by Wolfe, however, the Tenth Circuit held that it could not determine\nwhether substantial compliance had been attained because the district court had not\ncomplied with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by โfail[ing] to make\nthe specific and clear findings requiredโ by the rule.  Id. at 1089.  Vacating the judgment\nand remanding, the Tenth Circuit dictated that \nthe district court should (1) apply the substantial compliance standard set\nforth in [its] opinionโi.e., consider whether Defendants satisfied the\nessential purposes of the decree . . .; (2) outline its reasoning why\nDefendants satisfied (or did not satisfy) the essential purposes of the\n28\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 29 of 60 \ndecreeโi.e. justify its ultimate legal conclusions . . . ; (3) explain the\nmethodology employed to reach its factual findings . . .; and (4) specify the\nsubsidiary factual findings and reasoning necessary to support its judgment\nas to Defendantsโ compliance with each of the overall goals and enumerated\ncriteria in the decree.\nId. at 1089. \nIn light of the foregoing, the court initially must examine the express terms of the\nConsent Decree and Implementation Plan and ascertain their core purposes/requirements. \nNext, applying the above principles of law, the court must determine whether Defendant\nhas satisfied his burden of demonstrating that DHR is substantially complying with those\nrequirements and will remain in substantial compliance therewith. \n \nB. Terms of the Consent Decree\nCompliance with the Consent Decree โmeans satisfying the requirements set out in\nParagraph 31 of the Consent Decree.โ  (See 1999 Consent Order at 2 n.1.)  Paragraph 31\nof the Consent Decree contains four subsections, (a) - (d).  Defendant and Plaintiffs focus\non subsections (a) and (b), and, thus, the court confines its analysis to the same.15  \n15 Subsection (c) mandates that Defendant develop an Implementation Plan, as\nprovided in Section IX of the Consent Decree.  The parties jointly submitted an agreed-\nupon Implementation Plan which the court approved on November 1, 1993.  (Doc. Nos.\n264-265.)  Subsection (d) dictates that Defendant comply with certain procedural\nrequirements outlined in Sections X - XIV of the Consent Decree pertaining to counsel\nfor plaintiffsโ right of access, the court monitorโs role, the primacy of the decree, and\nattorneysโ fees for plaintiffs.  \n29\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 30 of 60 \nSubsections (a) and (b) of Paragraph 31 provide as follows:\n31. Defendant shall ensure that DHR, pursuant to the timetable in the\nImplementation Plan:\na.  Establishes a โsystem of careโ for class members and their families;\nb.  Operates the โsystem of careโ with the aim of achieving the goals\n     described in Section VII below and in conformity with the โprinciplesโ\n     or โstandardsโ set forth in Section VIII below.\n(Consent Decree at 13, ยง VII, ยถ 31 (Doc. No. 235).)\nโThe goals of the โsystem of care,โโ set out in Section VII, โshall be toโ:\na. Protect class members from abuse and neglect; and\nb. Enable class members to:\n  (i). Live with their families; and when that cannot be achieved\nthrough the provision of services, to live near their home; \n (ii). Achieve stability and permanency in their living situation;\n(iii). Achieve success in school; and \n (iv). Become stable, gainfully employed adults. \n \n(Id. at 14, ยง VII, ยถ 33.)  As stated in a footnote in Section VII, โ[t]he goals are meant,\namong other things, to explain the โneedsโ to which services are to be addressed.  The\nobject of services is to attain these goals.โ  (Id. at 14, ยง VII, ยถ 33 n.19.)  However, โ[t]he\nstatement of goals is not meant to guarantee attainment of the goals for every class\nmember.  Instead, DHR is obliged to provide services needed to enable class members to\nattain the goals.โ  (Id.)   \nSection VIII16 sets forth thirty โoperating principlesโ or โstandards.โ  (Id.\nat 15-32.)  The court has distilled the goals and operating principles into five broad\n16 Due to a typographical error, Section VIII is incorrectly designated as โSection\nVI.โ\n30\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 31 of 60 \ncategories:17  (1) the prevention of out-of-home placements and the advancement of\nfamily unification, but only when at-home placement provides an environment where the\nchild is safe from imminent and serious harm18 (core purpose one); (2) the delivery of\ncomprehensive services, in a coordinated and therapeutic manner, by competent staff with\nappropriate caseloads, to class members and families in home-based and community-\nbased settings, devised pursuant to individualized service plans (โISPsโ), for the purposes\nof facilitating home placement, satisfying the unique physical, emotional, social,\neducational and other needs of class members, and promoting smooth transitions for class\nmembers when they โage outโ of the system (core purpose two); (3) active participation\nby the child, parent and foster parent in the planning and delivery of services, to include\ninformed involvement so that the child, parent and foster parent have full understanding\nof these services and their rights and options (core purpose three); (4) child safety,\nencompassing the prevention of sexual abuse and neglect and the timely intervention and\ninvestigation of class members believed to be victims of sexual abuse and/or neglect (core\n17 These five categories do not purport to enumerate each and every goal and\nprinciple with particularity, but instead summarize the wide goals and principles upon\nwhich this case is based.  These categories, in sum and substance, mirror the areas of\nperformance discussed in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report and embody the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree.\n18 At this juncture, the court reiterates its strong position that no child is to be\nplaced in a home from which he or she has been removed whereupon return he or\nshe stands any chance of a repetition of the abusive behavior.  If DHR is to err, let it\nbe on the side of the safety of the child, not on the side of home unification merely\nfor the sake of bolstering the statistics.\n31\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 32 of 60 \npurpose four); and (5) stability and permanency in the class membersโ living situations,\nincluding, if in the childrenโs best interest, that when children are removed from their\nhomes, siblings are placed together and familial relationships are maintained through\nvisitations and other means (core purpose five).  (See Consent Decree at 15-32; see also\nCt. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 3-4.)\nC.  Analysis of Substantial Compliance\nOver a period of almost nine years, the court monitor, working conjunctively with\nPlaintiffs and Defendant, has systematically evaluated each of Alabamaโs sixty-seven\ncounties to determine whether each county is operating in accordance with the goals and\nprinciples of the Consent Decree, described above.  In August 1996, Shelby County was\nthe first county to achieve conversion, and, finally, almost nine years later, in March\n2005, the last county, Baldwin County, joined the โconvertedโ ranks.  The court monitor\nnow has declared every county โconverted,โ meaning that, at the time of conversion, the\ncounties were โconsistently practicing in accordance with the Consent Decree.โ19  (See,\ne.g., Ct. Ex. 1, Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Baldwin County.) \n19 The court italicizes โat the time of conversionโ because the court monitor further\nstates that each county โshould be declared โconverted,โ for as long as the county can\nsustain the level of practice achieved through this process of conversion.โ  (See, e.g., Ct.\nEx. 1, Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Baldwin County; see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report,\nAppendix A (Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Shelby County (โThe Monitor determines that\nShelby County DHR is practicing in accordance with principles of the R.C. Consent\nDecree and is designated converted as long as the above conditions are maintained.โ).) \n32\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 33 of 60 \nThe conversion of all the counties, over this lengthy and laborious nine-year\nprocess, is a great accomplishment and is an appropriate starting point for determining\nwhether Defendant has demonstrated that the core purposes of the Consent Decree and\nthe Implementation Plan have been achieved.  The credit for this achievement\nappropriately is bestowed upon the parties.  Through the continuing efforts of Plaintiffs โ\ntheir persistence in following up on compliance with the Consent Decree โ much progress\nhas been made, though the court recognizes not to Plaintiffsโ complete satisfaction.  Also,\nDefendant has worked painstakingly, expeditiously and cooperatively with the court\nmonitor and Plaintiffs, particularly in the last few years, to ensure that every county\nimplemented the system of care outlined in the Consent Decree.  (See, e.g., id. at 29\n(observing that DHR has โdemonstrated a good faith effort to comply with the courtโs\norder to convert all counties before R.C. is concluded[;] for example, DHR has had 18\ncounties declared converted since October 2002โ).)  The court commends Plaintiffs and\nDefendant for their perseverance over the years in negotiating the terms of, and in striving\nfor compliance with, the Consent Decree.  \nThe court credits and adopts the court monitorโs findings that, on their respective\ndates of conversion, the counties were โconsistently practicing in accordance with the\nConsent Decree.โ  (Ct. Ex. 1, Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Baldwin County; see also Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report, Appendix A (Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Shelby County).)\nDefendant relies heavily on this great accomplishment, and appropriately so, and there is\nno challenge by Plaintiffs to the court monitorโs conclusions that, on their dates of\n33\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 34 of 60 \nconversion, Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties had satisfied the requirements for compliance\nwith the Consent Decree.  As stated, the fact that the court monitor has declared each and\nevery county โconvertedโ is monumental, as paragraph 31 of the Consent Decree\nanticipated a county-by-county conversion, pursuant to staggered deadlines set out in the\nImplementation Plan.  With that said, however, the court finds that it cannot terminate the\nConsent Decree on that basis alone.  \n  The Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan contemplate a continuing\ncompliance by counties beyond their individual dates of conversion.  After the conversion\nof all sixty-seven counties, the Consent Decree and Implementation Plan set out the\nexpectation that the counties simultaneously would be operating โwith the aim of\nachieving the goals in Section VII . . . and in conformity with the โprinciplesโ or\nโstandardsโ set forth in Section VIII[.]โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 31 & n.18; see also Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 2-3 (ultimate goal of the county-by-county system of reform\nโhas been to change the practice of child welfare in Alabama in each of the 67 counties so\nthat a child and family who becomes involved with [Alabamaโs] child welfare system as a\nresult of allegations of abuse and neglect or other reason [are] served in accordance with\nthe principles of the system of careโ).) \nMoreover, as further espoused by the court monitor and not challenged by\nDefendant, the reason the Implementation Plan set staggered deadlines for county\nconversion was as follows:\n34\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 35 of 60 \nClearly, the expectation expressed in the conversion chapter [of the\nImplementation Plan] and by the monitor is that as counties achieved a level\nof practice that was in compliance with the Consent Decree, they would\ncontinue to perform at that level[;] then when all 67 counties were\nconverted, DHR would have implemented โthe system of careโ on a\nstatewide basis.    \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 6; see also id. at 11 (observing that โthe intent of\nconverting a county was to instill capacity within the county to maintain progress gained\nand not to externally support a county so that it would become compliant with R.C. for a\nminimal period of timeโ) (emphasis added).) \nIt is in the area of sustained substantial compliance and, relatedly, future\nsubstantial compliance which Plaintiffs challenge.  If Defendant cannot demonstrate that,\nafter conversion, counties are sustaining substantial compliance, then Plaintiffs contend\nthat it cannot be found that DHRโs system of care is operating in conformity with the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree or that DHR will remain in substantial compliance. \nPlaintiffs emphasize that Defendant bears the burden of setting forth evidence that DHR\nis and will remain in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree (Doc. No. 717 at 2),\nbut assert that the record does not support such findings. \nDefendant, on the other hand, emphasizes that the court monitor has โcertifiedโ\nDHRโs substantial compliance.  (Doc. No. 714 at 2.)  Specifically, in the concluding\nparagraphs of his November 2004 Report, the court monitor has recommended that the\ncourt find that โDHR is in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 60.)   The court, though, cannot merely adopt the court\n35\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 36 of 60 \nmonitorโs recommendation and fulfill its obligations under the law.  The court must\nascertain whether the evidence upon which the court monitor relies supports the court\nmonitorโs recommendations.  Cf. Joseph A. By Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1087-89 (holding that\ndistrict court erred in adopting special masterโs findings because there was insufficient\nfactual basis to support the legal conclusions reached by the special master).  As set out\nbelow, the court has been unable to reconcile the court monitorโs recommendation of\nโsubstantial complianceโ with the data and other information in the court monitorโs\nNovember 2004 Report.  Stated differently, Defendant has chosen to rely on the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report and the recommendations therein, yet he has failed to\nconnect the data to the court monitorโs ultimate recommendations, and the court has been\nunable to do so.  Defendant, thus, has left the court without the necessary evidentiary\nfoundation to declare that DHR is in substantial compliance and will remain in substantial\ncompliance, as is required for termination of the Consent Decree. \n1.  The Data in the Court Monitorโs November 2004 Report\nThe court monitorโs recommendations on pages 60 and 61 of his November 2004\nReport emerge after the court monitorโs discussion of various statistical data in other\nsections of his report.  The data arises from two primary sources:  (1) sustainability\nreviews conducted by DHRโs Family Services Partnershipโs Office of Quality\n36\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 37 of 60 \nAssurance20 (โSQAโ) (see Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 22, 29-39); and (2) other\ninternal data compiled by SQA for the purpose of โassess[ing] the functioningโ of the\nsystem of care on a statewide basis.  (Id. at 39-52.)  \nTurning first to the SQA sustainability reviews, the court monitorโs own valuation\nof these reviews casts doubt on the reliability of the sustainability reviews as an effective\ntool for measuring whether an individual county, or the system overall, is sustaining\nsubstantial compliance.  Two variables are particularly problematic.  First, the pool of\nchildren evaluated for the sustainability studies consisted of only 64 children.21  (See id.\nat 30, 34.)  As observed by the court monitor, \n[a] limitation of these case review data is the small sample sizes used by the\nFamily Services Partnershipโs Office of Quality Assurance when\nconducting on-site reviews.  As such, case review findings can be\nconsidered โrandom spot checksโ on children who are actively receiving\nservices from the county but statistically may not be fully representative of\noverall practice in a county.  Although each review participant is randomly\nselected for inclusion in the sustainability reviews, the total number of case\nreviews completed for each of these sustainability reviews ranged from four\nto eight. \n20 As stated by the court monitor, โthe primary role of SQA is conducting on-site\nreviews of county child welfare operations to determine whether counties are compliant\nwith the expectations for performance and practice principles, and to provide\nconsultation, training, and technical assistance to county-level QA staff and quality\nassurance committees.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 23.)\n21 The sample pool may even be smaller.  The court monitor observes that the\naggregate findings from these reviews โ[i]n some instancesโ are based on โfewerโ than 64\nchildren due to โmissing or incomplete dataโ or due to the fact that at the time of the\nreview one or more factors were deemed โnot applicable.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 30.)\n37\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 38 of 60 \n(Id. at 34.)  This court is not the first to discount the weight of statistics derived from a\nsmall sample pool.  In other contexts, courts have recognized the problem of predicting\nparticular outcomes when the data has been gathered from a sample pool of small size. \nSee Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299 (1977) (statistics lacked\nprobative weight given small size of pool); Pollis v. New School for Social Research, 132\nF.3d 115, 121-123 (2nd Cir. 1997) (holding that โdiscrimination may not be proved by\nstatistics involving so small a [sample] poolโ); Sengupta v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 804\nF.2d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 1986) (โthe problem with small labor pools is that slight changes\nin the data can drastically alter appearancesโ).\nSecond, at the time the court monitor issued his November 2004 Report, only\nfifteen of Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties โ or roughly 22 percent โ had undergone\nsustainability reviews by the SQA during 2003 and 2004.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report\nat 30.)  The limited number of reviews included in the Report also leads the court to\nquestion the reliability of the data derived therefrom.\nNeither the court monitor nor Defendant has presented any argument or grounds\nshowing that this data is an accurate predictor of substantial compliance.  Similarly,\nneither has discussed why the foregoing limitations pertaining to the small sample pool\nand incompleteness do not circumscribe the usefulness of the sustainability reviews.  In\nparticular, Defendant has not argued the weight which the court should give the data or\nhow the data is relevant to a finding of substantial compliance.  In short, there is nothing\nin the record which demonstrates that the data is an accurate predictor of substantial\n38\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 39 of 60 \ncompliance, given the few number of children included in the reviews and the fact that\nless than 25 percent of the counties were reviewed during the two-year period; thus, the\ncourt is compelled to find that this data is too unreliable, at least in its present form, to\nsustain Defendantโs burden of demonstrating substantial compliance.22\nEven if the court considers the statistical results of the sustainability reviews as\ndispositive of the issue of substantial compliance, it is unclear to the court how the data\nsupports a finding of substantial compliance.  On page 35 of his November 2004 Report,\nthe court monitor compiles the data from the sustainability reviews so as to assign each\ncounty an โoverall system performance rating.โ  (Id. at 35.)  The sustainability reviews,\nwhich apparently are similar to the reviews initially performed to ascertain whether a\ncounty had attained the goal of conversion (see id. at 29), reveal that only three of the\nfifteen counties demonstrated an โoverall system performance ratingโ satisfying the 85\npercent threshold initially employed by the court monitor to declare a county converted. \n(See id. at 35; see also id. at 25 (explaining, in general terms, that the court monitor\ndeclared a county converted โwhen 85% of child status and system performance ratings\n22 The court recognizes that the SQA sustainability reviews are an important\ncomponent of the Stateโs quality assurance mechanisms, (see Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 22-23), and, to this end, the court is not saying that the SQA sustainability\nreviews are not useful as one tool to gauge substantial compliance.  The court merely is\nsaying that Defendant has not demonstrated that, standing alone, the reviews included in\nthe court monitorโs November 2004 Report constitute a sufficient evidentiary foundation\nfrom which the court can find substantial compliance. \n39\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 40 of 60 \n[were] acceptable during an on-site compliance [review]โ).)  Disturbingly, five of the\nfifteen counties received ratings of only 25 percent.23  \nNotably, there is no explanation by Defendant or the court monitor as to why these\nโoverall system performance ratingsโ are not a barrier to a finding of substantial\ncompliance.  At the December 9, 2004, status conference, the court monitor essentially\nconceded that the results of the sustainability reviews did not equate substantial\ncompliance when he stated as follows:  โThe biggest challenge is how to sustain the level\nof performance that [DHR] has, in fact . . . the capacity to do.  And I purposely chose the\nword โcapacityโ and not โwas doingโ because of the last 15 [sustainability] reviews. . . .\nThe results of those reviews showed that nine of them were, in fact, not maintaining the\nlevel of practice that we really need to maintain.โ24  (Transcript from Dec. 9, 2004 status\nconference at 42 (Doc. No. 730).) \nMoreover, also unfavorable to Defendant, are the results of the aggregate findings\nfrom the sustainability reviews which reveal that, in fourteen areas denoted as โkey\nsystem performance indicators,โ the percentage of children who received โacceptableโ\n23 Jackson County is one of the counties with a 25 percent performance rating.  The\ncourt monitor has noted that Jackson County, in particular, exhibited โsignificant\nproblems with practice performanceโ and was 127% over caseload standards.  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 16.) \n24 Other than Barbour, Lowndes and Washington counties, no other county scored\n85 percent or higher.  Three counties, though, attained a 75 percent rating, and it may be\nthat the court monitor deems those counties to be maintaining an acceptable level of\npractice.\n40\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 41 of 60 \nratings fell below 85 percent in thirteen of the fourteen areas.25  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 32-33.)  To provide a specific example, of the fifteen counties reviewed, in the\ncategories of โIndividualized Service Planโ and โISP Implementationโ (i.e., core purpose\ntwo), only 41 percent and 64 percent, respectively, of the children reviewed received an\nโacceptableโ rating.  (Id. at 33.)  The court monitor also has observed that โthe\nfunctioning and adequacyโ of ISPs are of concern.  (See id. at 34.) \nWith that said, though, the court recognizes that the data is not completely\nnegative.  In contrast to the foregoing, in many of the fourteen areas denoted as โchild and\nfamily status ratings,โ a majority of the children received โacceptable ratings.โ  (Id.\nat 31.)  Reliance on these positive findings as indicators of substantial compliance,\nhowever, at the very least, requires an explanation of how the positive findings outweigh\nthe other negative factors.  Such an explanation is lacking from the court monitor and\nDefendant.  To the contrary, the court monitor has indicated that a balancing does not\nweigh in favor of DHR, given his ratings as to the countiesโ overall system performance\nand his statement at the December 9, 2004, status conference, discussed supra.  (See\n25 The percentage of children in the following fourteen areas who received an\nโacceptableโ rating are as follows: (1) child/family engagement (64%); (2) functional\nassessment (44%); (3) long-term view (57%); (4) individual service plan (41%);\n(5) resource availability (88%); (6) ISP implementation (64%); (7) family preservation\n(78%); (8) family support (78%); (9) service coordination (57%); (10) urgent response\n(76%); (11) agency responsiveness (75%); (12) transitions (36%); (13) monitoring and\nmodification (48%); and (13) effective results (68%).  (Id. at 33.)  โOverall performanceโ\nwas rated at 58 percent.  (Id.; see also id., Appendix B (defining each โsystem\nperformance indicatorโ).\n41\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 42 of 60 \nTranscript from Dec. 9, 2004 status conference at 42 (Doc. No. 730); see also Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2004 Report at 34 (summation of weaknesses in overall performance by the\nparticipating counties appears to outnumber summation of strengths).)\nMoreover, at times, a concern of regression, which is obverse to a finding of\nsubstantial compliance, emanates from the court monitorโs discussion of the results of the\nsustainability reviews.  The court is referring to the court monitorโs judgment that the\nsustainability reviews reveal โsubstantial variability in performance of practice\nfunctions,โ demonstrate that โconsistent performance of practice functions in compliance\nwith the practice principles of the Consent Decree is not occurring for some of the\nchildren and families,โ and โshow that the level of practice within some of the\nparticipating counties has declined after the county was declared converted.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 34.)  Furthermore, the court monitor notes that the โdecline\nin consistency of practice performance in some countiesโ has resulted in part due to โtime\nelapsed since a county was declared converted. . . .โ  (Id. at 35.)\n42\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 43 of 60 \nAs stated, the sustainability reviews are not the sole source of data in the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report.26  DHR also has collected other internal data which the\ncourt monitor has examined.  Notwithstanding Defendantโs absence of analysis as to how\nthis data supports a finding of substantial compliance, the court independently has sifted\nthrough the data in an effort to find evidence thereof.  For the reasons to follow, the court\nhas been unable to reach any conclusion other than that the data does not establish a\nsufficient evidentiary foundation from which the court can find that Defendant has\nsustained his burden of demonstrating that DHR is functioning in substantial compliance\nwith the Consent Decree.  As explained, the data indicates that DHR is not fulfilling four\nof the five core purposes of the Consent Decree.\nAs to the goal of minimizing out-of-home placements (core purpose one), the data\nshows that, although the number of children in out-of-home care between 1989 and 1995\nsteadily decreased from 4802 to 3932, that number โhas been steadily increasing since\nthat time.โ  (Id. at 43.)  At the end of fiscal year 2003, 5988 children were in out-of-home\ncare, and, as of the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 (i.e., the most recent data) that\n26 The court recognizes that, in addition to these SQA sustainability reviews, there\nalso exists county quality assurance committees which also perform reviews.  (See Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 36-39.)  Although the court monitor recognizes the\nimportance of these committees as a โcritical component of a functional system of care,โ\nthe court monitor has noted weaknesses in those reviews and the need to improve โinter-\nrater reliabilityโ through training and other means.  (Id. at 38-39.)  It does not appear that\nthe court monitor has relied to any significant extent on the county reviews in reaching\nhis conclusions.  To the extent though that either the court monitor or Defendant are\nrelying on this data, there is an absence of explanation as to the dataโs reliability.\n43\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 44 of 60 \nnumber increased again to 6175.  According to the court monitor, these figures in 2003\nand 2004 are โthe highest total of children in out-of-home care since the implementation\nof R.C.โ  (Id.)  \nAlthough the court monitor postulates that the increase โmay beโ the result of a\nrise in methamphetamine abuse (id. at 45), an external factor outside of DHRโs control,\nthe court finds problematic to a finding of substantial compliance the court monitorโs\nconcern that regression also is a culprit.  The court monitor has linked, at least in part, the\nhigh number of children in out-of-home care to โsubstantial increasesโ in the number of\nchildren placed in foster care by counties after they have been declared โconvertedโ and\nโreleased from monitoring.โ27  (Id. at 11; see also id. at 46; id at 47, Display 25\n(representing that, subsequent to conversion, nineteen counties experienced increases in\nout-of-home care ranging from 22 percent to 250 percent).)  \nThe court monitor further observes that โthe path of least resistance is to take a\nchild into foster care, and [that] it is more complex to work in the childโs home and with\nthe family to find a workable solution.โ  (Id. at 43.)  The court monitor states that there is\na direct correlation between the deterioration of protective supervision for children and\n27 As stated by the court monitor, there has been a โgeneral trendโ that, when\ncounties are in the process of achieving conversion, the number of children in foster care\ndecreases.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 44-45.)  For example, the court monitor\nnotes that, between 1998 and 2001, a time period representing a reduction in the number\nof children entering foster care, thirty-seven counties were released from court monitoring\nand, thus, performing at peak levels.  (Id.)  From aught that appears, though, that trend\nreverses once a county is released from court supervision.\n44\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 45 of 60 \nthe increase of out-of-home care.  (Id. at 42-43.)  The court monitorโs assertion that\nstatewide this correlation has proved true in recent years (id.), coupled with the court\nmonitorโs statement that increases in children in foster care have occurred in some\ncounties after being released from court monitoring, gives the court grave concern as to\nwhether the counties are continuing to practice at acceptable levels in the area of\nminimizing out-of-home placements.  (Id. at 44, 46.)  Importantly, Defendant has not\npresented any analysis or argument which negates or mitigates the court monitorโs\nobservations and has not submitted evidence which demonstrates that the core purpose\npertaining to the prevention of out-of-home placement is being fulfilled.28\nAs to core purpose two, although internal data complied by DHR demonstrates\nthat the counties have improved in the area of completing ISPs within timeframe\nexpectations,29 the court monitor has noted that, based on the sustainability reviews, a\nquestion arises as to whether the quality of the formulation and implementation of ISPs,\n28 Also part of core purpose one is the advancement of family unification, but the\ncourt has been unable to find any data or other evidence in the record concerning this\ngoal, and Defendant has cited none.  Although, for example, the court monitor states that\nโthere are fewer barriers to children maintaining bonds with their family members,โ that\nstatement simply is too conclusory for the court to adopt as its own.  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 59); see Joseph A. By Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1087-89 (reversing judgment on\nthe ground that district court erroneously adopted special masterโs findings because there\nwas insufficient factual basis to support the legal conclusions reached by the special\nmaster).\n29 โCurrent policy expectations are that initial ISPs are completed within 30 days of\nthe case being opened for services, whereas[] ISPs reviews (updated ISPs) are to occur on\nan as-needed basis and within six months of the most recent ISP.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 50.)   \n45\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 46 of 60 \nnamely their โfunctioning and adequacy,โ is conforming with the principles of the\nConsent Decree.  (Id. at 34.)  The data in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report\npertaining to ISPs, as discussed herein, appears to contradict the court monitorโs\nconclusion at page 59 of his November 2004 Report that the principles of the Consent\nDecree pertaining to ISPs are โbeing met with exceedingly high consistency.โ  (Id. at 59.) \nAt the very least, the court finds that the Report is incomplete as to what facts form the\nbasis of the court monitorโs conclusion.30\nAdditionally, the court monitor has stressed that to maintain the integrity of DHRโs\nsystem of care DHR must strive to comply with the court-ordered caseload standards. \nThe essence of this directive is encompassed as part of core purpose two.  However, the\nfailure of post-converted counties to sustain caseload levels within the court-ordered\ncaseload standards has been of particular concern to the court monitor because a\nโbenchmarkโ for determining compliance is a countyโs ability to maintain the caseload\nlevels dictated in the courtโs order.  (Id. at 21 (noting that he has expressed this concern in\nwritten correspondence on at least four occasions, beginning in April 2003).)  The court\nmonitor states that โthe increased number of countiesโ with โcaseloads over standards\nraises questions regarding a countyโs ability to sustain practice in compliance with the\n30 As another example of incompleteness, in the one area where the data shows\nsignificant compliance problems concerning timely completion of ISPs, DHR provides an\nexplanation for the low statistic, but the court monitor indicates that he is unable to\nโverif[y] through currently available data systemsโ DHRโs explanation.  (See Ct. Monitor\nReport at 52.) \n46\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 47 of 60 \nConsent Decree.โ  (Id. at 22.)  The latter observations constitute further evidence that\nDHR is not fulfilling core purpose two.    \nMoreover, turning to core purpose three, the court has been unable to ascertain the\nfactual basis for the court monitorโs ultimate conclusion that โ[f]oster parents are much\nmore active participants in the individual service planning process[.]โ  (Id. at 59.) \nDefendant has not assisted the court by citing the evidence which supports this\nconclusion.  Cf. Joseph A. By Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1087-89 (reversing judgment on the\nground that district court erroneously adopted special masterโs findings because there was\ninsufficient factual basis to support the legal conclusions reached by the special master).  \nIn other areas, the court monitor has announced that the data is insufficient for him\nto form a reasoned opinion as to compliance.  Specifically, as to core purpose five, the\ncourt monitor observes that โ[t]he timely achievement of permanency [of a childโs living\nsituation]โ is a โcritical component of child welfare services as specified by the\nexpectations of [the Consent Decree].โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 48.)  Yet, in his\nNovember 2004 Report, after reviewing the available data pertaining to permanency for\nfiscal years 2000 through 2003, the court monitor concludes that the issue of permanency\nโneeds more data analysis and more detailed studyโ and that โ[c]urrently there [is] not\nsufficient data to fully evaluate and judge DHRโs performance on permanency.โ  (Id.\nat 50; see also id. at 57 (observing that โ[t]he timely and consistent achievement of\npermanency remains a complex challenge for not only Alabama, but all state child\nwelfare systemsโ).)  \n47\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 48 of 60 \nAs to the goal of providing a child who is in out-of-home care with a stable home\nenvironment, with minimal risk of placement disruption, another component of core\npurpose five, the court monitor again states that he lacks all of the data needed to evaluate\nperformance in this area.  (Id. at 50.)  Specifically, while the court monitor observes that\nthere is โsome data availableโ which highlights trends regarding the โstability of\nplacement for children in out-of-home care,โ he says that the data is incomplete without\nadditional information regarding โdistribution of placement.โ  (Id.)   The court monitor,\nhowever, states that he โdoes not have access to this distribution of placement data.โ  (Id.) \nDefendant has not offered any additional evidence or countervailing argument to refute\nthe court monitorโs conclusion as to the absence and necessity of such data.  Nor has\nDefendant indicated that any additional evidence is available.  In sum, there is no\nevidence from which the court can ascertain whether the core purpose of stability and\npermanency has been fulfilled. \nPositive data, though, does exist as to core purpose four pertaining to the\nprevention and timely interventions and investigations of class members believed to be\nvictims of sexual abuse and/or neglect.  The court monitor indicates that some\nโquantitative indicatorsโ as to whether or not DHR is ensuring child safety are revealed\nthrough data compiled by DHR regarding the number of child abuse and neglect (โCANโ)\nreports received, the timeliness of contact to these reports, and the timeliness of the\nresolution of the CAN report.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 39.)  According to the\ncourt monitor, the data demonstrates a steady and notable increase in the percentage of\n48\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 49 of 60 \ncases having initial CAN contacts within the required five days.  (Id.)  To Defendantโs\ncredit, there is data that, in 91.4 percent of cases, DHR caseworkers are making contact\nwith children who are the subject of CAN reports within five days, and percentages of\ninitial CAN contacts have averaged approximately 90 percent during the previous three\nyears.  (Id. at 41.)  The court monitor observes that these figures represent a โconsiderable\nincrease since 1997โ when only 49 percent of children were contacted by a social worker\nwithin five days.31  (Id.)  \nOverall, though, having carefully studied the data in the court monitorโs November\n2004 Report, the court has been unable to reconcile the data with the court monitorโs final\nconclusion that โcurrent performance levels are adequateโ and his recommendation โthat\nthe court find that DHR is in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report at 60.)  In sum, for the reasons stated, the court finds that the\ndata in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report falls short of satisfying Defendantโs\nburden.\n31 Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that, according to a United States\ngovernment study conducted by the Childrenโs Bureau and the Administration for\nChildren and Families, located within the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices, Alabama achieved substantial conformity within the safety outcome titled\nโChildren are, first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 53.)  \n49\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 50 of 60 \n2.  Other Impediments to a Finding of Substantial Compliance\nTwo more reverberating themes emerge from the court monitorโs November 2004\nReport which seemingly contradict the monitorโs recommendation of substantial\ncompliance.  First, the court monitor has observed that DHR has the โcapacityโ to\nperform in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  Having the capacity or the\nability to substantially comply with the Consent Decree, though, simply is not the\nequivalent of actual substantial compliance.  Only the latter โ i.e, a demonstration of\nsubstantial compliance โ satisfies Defendantโs burden under the termination provision of\nthe Consent Decree.  \nSpecifically, in his concluding remarks, the court monitor states that โ[t]he data in\nthis report show that each county in Alabama has demonstrated the capacity to perform in\naccordance with the principles of the R.C. Consent Decree.โ  (Id. at 60 (first paragraph/\nemphasis added); see also id. at 58 (โThe system currently has the capacity to practice\nchild welfare in accordance with the principles of the Consent Decree.โ).)  By choosing\nthe word โcapacity,โ the court monitor appears to be referring to the fact that, during the\npreceding nine years, he has proclaimed that each county has implemented the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree.  (See, e.g., Ct. Ex. 1, Ct. Monitor Letter, re: Baldwin\nCounty.)  He, however, has made clear that a county must โsustain the level of practice\nachieved through this process of conversionโ in order to retain the status of โconverted.โ \n(See id.)  Recently, he has espoused a concern regarding the adeptness of counties to\nmaintain a level of practice which equates substantial compliance.  Namely, at the\n50\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 51 of 60 \nDecember 9, 2004, status conference, he stated that, although DHR had the โcapacityโ to\nsustain an acceptable level of performance, the sustainability reviews indicate that DHR\nwas not performing up to its capacity.  (Transcript from Dec. 9, 2004 status conference\nat 42 (Doc. No. 730).)  In other words, although through county-by-county conversion\nDHR has established the required โsystem of care,โ as required by paragraph 31(a) of the\nConsent Decree, the court monitor appears to be saying that DHR is having difficulties\nโoperat[ing] the โsystem of careโโ in accordance with the Consent Decreeโs goals and\nprinciples, as required by paragraph 31(b).  (Consent Decree at 13, ยง VII, ยถ 31(a)-(b).)\nSecond, as mentioned herein, the court monitor has indicated a problem of\nregression.  Although the court monitor says that Defendant โdeserves commendation for\nasserting conversion in all counties,โ he qualifies his praise by observing that โthere\ncontinues to be quantitative and qualitative data that show that the significant\nimprovement of practice made through the conversion process has not been consistently\nmaintained in all of the counties that have been declared converted.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 11.)  \nIn fact, in his November 2004 Report, the court monitor alludes to a problem of\nregression multiple times.  (Id. at 11 (observing โsubstantial increasesโ in the number of\nchildren placed in foster care by counties after they have been declared โconvertedโ and\nโreleased from monitoringโ); id. at 34 (remarking that certain โreview findings show that\nthe level of practice within some of the participating counties has declined after the\ncounty was declared convertedโ); id. at 13 (observing recent trend of counties โlosing\n51\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 52 of 60 \nallocated staff positionsโ after having been declared compliant; โsince September 2003, a\ntotal of 62 allocated positions have been lost from counties previously determined to be\nconverted, despite the total statewide allocated staffing level decreasing by 20 during this\nsame timeframe.โ); id. at 21 (noting a โtrend[]โ of โstaff reductions in converted\ncountiesโ); id. at 22 (noting that โthe increased number of countiesโ with โcaseloads over\nstandards raises questions regarding a countyโs ability to sustain practice in compliance\nwith the Consent Decreeโ).)  \nThe foregoing observations of the court monitor, in the opinion of the court,\ndemonstrate a tendency of converted counties to regress, rather than to sustain substantial\ncompliance, once the court is no longer overseeing the countiesโ progress.  Moreover, the\ncourt monitorโs recent emphasis on DHRโs โcapacityโ and de-emphasis on actual,\nsatisfactory performance suggests that the court monitor is assuming that Defendant will\nbring performance up to par.  The court, though, is not at liberty to make the same\nassumption because the Consent Decree expressly provides that Defendant must\ndemonstrate that DHR โisโ in substantial compliance and โwill remainโ in substantial\ncompliance, and, as discussed herein, evidence to support Defendantโs burden is lacking. \n(Consent Decree ยถ 93, as amended by 1999 Consent Order.)\n52\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 53 of 60 \n3.  Consideration of Other Factors\n(a)  good faith\nGood faith also is a factor relevant to the courtโs inquiry of whether to terminate a\nconsent decree.  See Johnson, 348 F.3d at 1343-44; Gonzales, 151 F.3d at 531; City of\nMiami, 2 F.3d at 1505-06.  The court has not ignored Defendantโs good faith efforts made\nin this case.  For example, although Defendant did not meet the October 1, 2001, deadline\nfor conversion, Plaintiffs have acknowledged that Defendant attempted to do so in good\nfaith, and the court concurs.  (Mem. of Understanding, entered Dec. 5, 2002 (Doc. No.\n650).)  Defendant also worked diligently and in good faith in promptly addressing the\nspecific โproblem areasโ the court enumerated at the December 9, 2004 status conference. \nMoreover, the court has studied and is impressed with DHRโs Child Welfare\nStrategic Plan and DHRโs institutionalization of those procedures.  Implementation of the\nStrategic Plan demonstrates DHRโs strong commitment to complying with the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree and to the children who come into DHRโs care.32 \nFurthermore, Defendant is to be credited for DHRโs efforts in ensuring that budgetary\n32 The court notes, though, that, while DHRโs Child Welfare Strategic Plan\nincludes numerous laudable strategies directed toward sustaining child welfare practice\nwithin converted counties, including the goal of conducting โfull, onsite reviewsโ of each\ncounty at least once every three years (Child Welfare Strategic Plan, at 43 (Ex. 1 to Doc.\nNo. 714); see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 23, 29), the Strategic Plan was\nimplemented only last Spring.  Defendant has not presented evidence as to whether the\nstrategies have achieved the purposes for which they were implemented.  It may be that\nsuch evidence is unavailable given that the Strategic Plan has been in existence for only a\nyear.\n53\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 54 of 60 \nrestraints do not adversely impact DHRโs child welfare services.  The court also does not\nquestion the current Commissionerโs commitment to this case and Alabamaโs child\nwelfare system.  The court, however, finds that Defendantโs good faith, in and of itself,\ncannot justify a finding of substantial compliance.  See Gonzales, 151 F.3d at 531\n(observing that, โnotwithstandingโ a defendantโs good faith, โa district court may not\nterminate its jurisdiction until it finds both that Defendants are in compliance with the\ndecreeโs terms and that the decreeโs objectives have been fulfilledโ); cf. Fortin v.\nCommissioner, 692 F.2d 790, 796-97 (1st Cir. 1982) (โthe Departmentโs evidence of\ndiligence aloneโ did not satisfy its burden of demonstrating impossibility of compliance\nwith consent decree so as to avoid contempt); Palmigiano v. DiPrete, 700 F. Supp. 1180,\n1194 (D.D.C. 1996) (good faith effort of defendants to comply with consent decree is not\nvalid defense in civil contempt proceedings).   \n(b)  specific terms providing for continued supervision\nand jurisdiction over the consent decree\nAnother consideration for the court in deciding whether to terminate the Consent\nDecree is whether the Decree contains any specific terms providing for continued\nsupervision and jurisdiction.  See Gonzales, 151 F.3d at 531; City of Miami, 2 F.3d\nat 1505-06.  The 1999 Consent Order, which amended the Consent Decree, provided that,\nafter the conversion of all sixty-seven counties which was to be completed by October 1,\n2001, Defendant could not move for termination of the Consent Decree until one year had\nelapsed.  (1999 Consent Order ยถ 11 & Ex. 1 (attached thereto).)  The purpose of the one-\n54\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 55 of 60 \nyear period was to allow for continued monitoring and reviews to โassure compliance\nwith all requirements [] of the decreeโ and to โassure that conversion has been achieved.โ \n(Id., Ex. 2 (โStrategic Conversion Planโ at 3, 8-9)); see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 29 (โThe 1999 [Consent] Order also specified that after the conversion of all\ncounties, the following year (until October 2002) was a time period for the counties to\ndemonstrate that the level of practice achieved through the conversion process would be\nsustained.โ).)\nDefendant, though, did not meet the October 1, 2001 deadline.  It took Defendant\nthree-and-a-half more years than anticipated to attain the goal of conversion of all\ncounties:  Baldwin County, the final county to attain conversion status, was not declared\nconverted by the court monitor until March 11, 2005.  Despite having only recently\nattained this goal, Defendant now argues for immediate termination of the Consent\nDecree without presenting any reason or evidence to justify the elimination of a\nmonitoring period.  In sum, the Consent Decreeโs expectation that, after all the counties\nhad converted, court supervision would continue for at least a year to monitor\nsustainability is another factor which weighs against termination of the Consent Decree.\nRelatedly, the court finds somewhat troublesome Defendantโs rush for closure\nwhen, from aught that appears, Defendant was dilatory in implementing the court-ordered\nreport card mechanism which the parties and the court monitor agreed would assist in\n55\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 56 of 60 \nmeasuring the countiesโ ability to sustain substantial compliance.33  (See Nov. 4, 2003\nOrder (Doc. No. 687).)  Defendant also urges the court to terminate the Consent Decree\nprior to the publication of any of the report cards.  (Id. ยถ 4.)\n \n4.  Summation of Courtโs Findings that Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy\nHis Burden of Demonstrating Present and Future Substantial Compliance\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court finds that Defendant has not met his burden of\ndemonstrating โthat DHR is in substantial compliance with the requirements of the\nDecree and of the Implementation Plan.โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, as amended by 1999\nConsent Order.)  Defendant relies on the November 2004 Report of the court monitor. \nThe court monitor, however, has failed to demonstrate how the data and other information\nin his Report coalesce with his recommendation of substantial compliance.  Defendant,\nwho bears the burden of demonstrating substantial compliance, has not offered any\nmeaningful analysis to assist the court in connecting the data to the court monitorโs\nultimate recommendations.  Indeed, the courtโs review of the data has been prolonged by\nDefendantโs failure to establish how the data supports the premise for which it is offered. \nIn short, the court finds that the record is devoid of sufficient evidence which\n33 Defendantโs failure to comply with the courtโs order was noted by the court\nmonitor in his November 2004 Report.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 23 n.5; see also\nid. at 56, 61.)  After the status conference in December 2004, at which the court\nemphasized Defendantโs non-compliance with its order, Defendant worked quickly to\ncomply with the courtโs order.  In his report filed February 4, 2005 (Doc. No. 735),\nDefendant notified the court that DHR now has implemented a โReport Card Rating\nSystem for Use for All 67 Counties.โ  (Id. ยถ 4 and Ex. B.)  \n56\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 57 of 60 \ndemonstrates that, for any period of time, converted counties are remaining in substantial\ncompliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree.  \nMoreover, the court monitorโs concerns that counties are regressing after\nconversion and that DHR is failing to perform to its capacity also weigh against a finding\nof substantial compliance.  Additionally, the fact that the Implementation Plan anticipated\na monitoring period after full conversion is another reason suggesting that termination of\nthe Consent Decree is premature.\nTurning to the second prong of Defendantโs burden, in the courtโs opinion, the best\nevidence to support a finding that DHR โwill remain in substantial complianceโ (Consent\nDecree ยถ 93, as amended by 1999 Consent Order) is evidence that, after conversion,\ncounties have continued to operate in a manner that substantially complies with the\nConsent Decree.  As indicated, that evidence is lacking.  \nThe court also finds significant the fact that the court monitor never makes an\nexpress recommendation that the court find that Defendant โwill remain in substantial\ncompliance.โ  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 60-61.)  To the contrary, his\nrecommendation indicates a hesitancy to make such a recommendation.  Specifically, the\ncourt monitor recommends continued supervision by the court for a period of one year to\npermit Defendant to file โtwo performance reportsโ which demonstrate that DHR is\nsubstantially complying in the โareas of performanceโ evaluated in the court monitorโs\n57\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 58 of 60 \nNovember 2004 Report.34  (Id. at 61.)  The court monitorโs recommendation is yet another\nindicator that the court monitor is not convinced that Defendant has demonstrated that\nDHR will remain in substantial compliance.35  At best, the court finds that there remains\nuncertainty as to whether Defendant will be able to remain in substantial compliance once\nthe court terminates the injunction in this case.  \nAccordingly, based on the findings set out herein, the court rejects the court\nmonitorโs recommendation that โthe court find that DHR is in substantial compliance\nwith the Consent Decree.โ  (Id. at 60.)  The court also rejects the court monitorโs\nrecommendation โthat the independent monitoring of the Consent Decree be terminated.โ \n(Id. at 61.) \n Having carefully considered how to proceed in this case, so as to permit\nDefendant sufficient time to demonstrate substantial compliance, the court shall direct\n34 Although the court monitor recommends that the court find that Defendant is in\nsubstantial compliance, he also advises that, as an alternative to termination of the\nConsent Decree, the court retain jurisdiction over the Consent Decree for one year. \nPreviously, the court directed the parties to address whether, once the court finds that\nDefendant has satisfied his twofold burden of demonstrating substantial compliance, it\nhas the authority to retain jurisdiction for one year during which time โeither party could\nremove to reinstate the case, if appropriate.โ  (Ct. Order, Oct. 21, 2004 (Doc. No. 711).) \nIn response, Plaintiffs take the position that the court can and should retain jurisdiction,\nwhile Defendant contends that a finding of โsubstantial complianceโ mandates\ntermination of the Consent Decree.  The court notes the partiesโ divergent positions, but at\nthis time the court need not address this issue given its finding that Defendant has not met\nhis burden.\n35 The court monitorโs recommendation also is consistent with his position at the\nOctober 29, 2002, status conference that, upon completion of the conversion of all sixty-\nseven counties, a monitoring period should commence.  (See Doc. No. 645.)\n58\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 59 of 60 \nDefendant to file a performance report, as recommended by the court monitor.  (Id.)  The\nperformance report shall be filed on August 4, 2005,36 and shall include the county report\ncard ratings ordered by the court.  At that time, if appropriate, Defendant may renew his\nmotion to terminate the Consent Decree and Implementation Plan.  The motion must cure\nthe deficiencies recited herein and include careful analysis of the evidence which sustains\nDefendantโs dual burden of demonstrating substantial compliance. \n \nV.  CONCLUSION\nSixteen and a half years is a long time for a federal court to oversee the operation\nof the State of Alabamaโs child welfare system.  As the court previously has observed,\nโ[f]ederalism dictates that a federal court withdraw from the realm of state affairs at the\nearliest opportunity.  This court is an ardent believer in [federalism] and would like\nnothing more than to be free from the immense burden of monitoring DHRโs operations.โ \nR.C., 969 F. Supp. at 703.  Indeed, the court is more anxious than Defendant to return this\ncase to the State; however, the court โmust remain true to the wording and intent of [the\nConsent Decree and of the Implementation Plan], until their goals are met.โ  Gonzales,\n151 F.3d at 531.  As stated herein, Defendant has not satisfied his twofold burden of\n36 In its February 2005 report (see Doc. No. 735), Defendant represented that the\nreport cards will be published twice a year, presumably every six months.  (See Doc. No.\n735.)  The court assumes that by August 4, 2005, the first report cards will have been\npublished.\n59\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 752     Filed 05/13/2005     Page 60 of 60 \ndemonstrating substantial compliance; therefore, the court must deny Defendantโs motion\nfor dismissal and termination of the Consent Decree. \nVI.  ORDER\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, it is CONSIDERED and ORDERED that\nDefendantโs motion for dismissal and termination of the Consent Decree (Doc. No. 714)\nbe and the same is hereby DENIED at this time.\nIt is further CONSIDERED and ORDERED that on August 4, 2005, Defendant\nfile a performance report, consistent with directives set out herein.  \nDone this 13th day of May, 2005.\n /s/ Ira DeMent                                                      \nSENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n60",

On  June  11,  1991,  the  court  conditionally  approved  the \ndecree,  subject to objections that might be presented at a  hearing \npursuant  to  Rule  23(e),  Fed.R.Civ.P.

ORDER     147\n4\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 5 of 148(cid:10)\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nThis cause is before the court on the second motion for order terminating Consent\nDecree (Doc. No. 761), filed by the Honorable Page Walley, Ph.D., who by virtue of his\nposition as the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Human Resources (โDHRโ)\nis the defendant in this long-running litigation involving institutional reform of DHRโs\nchild welfare system.1  The first motion for order terminating Consent Decree was denied\nby the court in a memorandum opinion and order entered on May 13, 2005.  See R.C. v.\nWalley (โR.C. Iโ), 390 F. Supp.2d 1030 (M.D. Ala. 2005).  In R.C. I, the court found that\nโDefendant ha[d] not submitted evidence sufficient to sustain his burden of demonstrating\nthat DHR โisโ and โwill remainโ in substantial compliance with the terms of the Consent\nDecree and of the Implementation Plan as required for termination of said Decree.โ  Id.\nat 1033.  \nAs grounds for his second motion, Defendant asserts that he has submitted an\nadequate evidentiary record to support termination of the Consent Decree, which has\ngoverned in this case since 1991, and that this evidence addresses and cures the\ndeficiencies outlined by the court in R.C. I.  Conversely, Plaintiffs, who opposed the first\nmotion and likewise oppose the instant โsecondโ motion, argue that there is no\nevidentiary basis for termination of the Consent Decree and that continued judicial\n1 Because a lawsuit against a public official in his official capacity is, in effect, a\nsuit against the underlying public entity, the court refers to โDefendantโ and โDHRโ\ninterchangeably.\n5\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 6 of 148(cid:10)\noversight is necessary to bring Defendant in substantial compliance with the requirements\nof the Consent Decree.\nAfter careful consideration of the arguments of counsel, the relevant law and the\nrecord as a whole, the court finds that DHR successfully has reformed its child welfare\nsystem by developing a system of care which substantially complies with the\nrequirements of the Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan and that judicial\noversight is no longer necessary to avoid return to the depraved conditions that led to the\ncommencement of this lawsuit in 1988 and to the courtโs intervention.2  The court finds\nthat Defendant has met his burden of demonstrating DHRโs substantial compliance under\n2  This class action lawsuit was filed on November 15, 1988, on behalf of a minor\nwho is known by his initials โR.C.โ  As set out in R.C. I, \n \nR.C. was an eight-year-old boy who allegedly had been abused by his\nmother and later neglected by his father.  Ultimately, R.C. was placed in the\ncustody of DHR.  (Compl. at 1-4 (Doc. No. 1).)\nWhile in the custody of DHR, R.Cโs welfare allegedly was not much better\nthan it was when he lived with his parents.  R.C. was subjected to a series\nof short-term placements, including confinement in psychiatric hospitals.  It\nwas alleged that R.C. was heavily medicated with psychotropic drugs and\ndenied visitation with his father.  Eventually, R.C. was placed in a\nlong-term residential treatment facility many miles from home.  (Id. at 5-6.)\nR.C.โs plight was alleged to be symbolic of the fate of numerous other\nchildren under the care of DHR.  R.C., on behalf of a class, alleged that the\nconditions and practices in the child welfare system in Alabama were\nconstitutionally deplorable and in violation of federal statutes.  Through\nclass certification, R.C. sought to alleviate these systemic deprivations\nwithin DHRโs child welfare system.  (Am. Compl. at 16 (Doc. No. 22).) \n390 F. Supp.2d at 1032.\n6\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 7 of 148(cid:10)\nthe Consent Decreeโs two-pronged termination clause and that, accordingly, Defendantโs\nmotion is due to be granted.3  \nII.  JURISDICTION\nThe Consent Decree bestows upon the court shared authority with the court\nmonitor to determine compliance with the Consent Decree, but sole authority to terminate\nthe Consent Decree upon motion of Defendant.  (Consent Decree ยถยถ 86, 91, 93, entered\nJune 11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235)), as amended by 1999 Consent Order (Doc. No. 511));\nR.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1034.  A court also maintains inherent jurisdiction over its\ndecrees.  See Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013, 1018 (6th Cir.\n1994); Berger v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir. 1985) (โConsent decrees are\nsubject to continuing supervision and enforcement by the court.โ).  The court, thus, acts\nwithin its jurisdiction in ruling on the present motion to terminate the Consent Decree.\n3 The court notes that at least eleven lawyers have represented Defendant during\nthe course of this litigation.  A few have been absolutely adversarial, but the majority\nhave been willing to work with Plaintiffs and the court monitor in effecting overall\nsubstantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  The court commends those who have\nchosen to be cooperative.\n7\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 8 of 148(cid:10)\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA.  The Standard for Termination of the Consent Decree\n1.  Generally\nThe court begins with the principles, duly emphasized by Defendant, that Consent\nDecrees โare not intended to operate in perpetuity,โ Board of Education of Oklahoma\nCity Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248 (1991), and that โ[r]eturning\ngovernmental entities to the control of local authorities โat the earliest practicable date is\nessential to restore their true accountability to our governmental system.โโ  Jordan v.\nWilson, 951 F. Supp. 1571, 1580 (M.D. Ala. 1996) (quoting Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S.\n467, 490 (1992)); see also Reynolds v. McInnes, 338 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir. 2003)\n(โFederal court oversight of an interference in the operations of a state government\ndepartment or agency โshould be as narrow and short-livedโ as fulfilling the duty to\neradicate [the violation] allows.โ) (quoting Ensley Branch, NAACP v. Seibels, 31 F.3d\n1548, 1574-75 (11th Cir. 1994) (brackets added).  The court concurs wholeheartedly with\nthe foregoing principles, and, as the court stated in R.C. I, it โis more anxious than\nDefendant to return this case to the State[.]โ  390 F. Supp.2d at 1059.  At the same time,\nhowever, while the goal of achieving state and local autonomy of non-federal public\ninstitutions is a substantial one, a parallel goal of obvious equal importance is that the\noffending party must โremedy the violationโ which the consent decree seeks to cure. \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 489; Sims v. Montgomery County Comโn, 9 F. Supp.2d 1281, 1288\n(M.D. Ala. 1998).  Stated in slightly different terms, termination of a consent decree is\n8\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 9 of 148(cid:10)\nnot appropriate unless the decreeโs purposes have โโbeen fully achieved.โโ  U.S. v. City\nof Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1505 (11th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).  \nIn R.C. I, the court opined that, notwithstanding that the instant Consent Decree\nhad been in effect at that time for almost fifteen years, termination was not warranted\nbecause, in essence, Defendant had failed to meet his evidentiary burden of\ndemonstrating that DHR had remedied the violations which the Consent Decree sought to\neliminate.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1059.  Defendantโs burden is embodied in the two-part\ntermination clause of the Consent Decree, to which the court now turns.\n2.  The Terms of the Consent Decree and its Termination Clause\nโA district court must look to the specific terms of a consent decree in determining\nwhether and when to terminate supervision or jurisdiction over it.โ  Gonzales v. Galvin,\n151 F.3d 526, 531 (6th Cir. 1998).  The Consent Decree is a detailed document, forty\npages in length, which sets out a comprehensive agreement for transforming the\noperations of DHRโs child protective services and foster care systems (โchild welfare\nsystemโ).4  Paragraph 31 of the Consent Decree provides as follows:\nDefendant shall ensure that DHR, pursuant to the timetable in the\nImplementation Plan:\na.  Establishes a โsystem of careโ for class members and their families;\n4 For simplicity, the court refers to DHRโs child protective services and foster care\nsystems as the โchild welfare system.โ \n9\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 10 of 148(cid:10)\nb.  Operates the โsystem of careโ with the aim of achieving the goals\ndescribed in Section VII below and in conformity with the โprinciplesโ or\nโstandardsโ set forth in Section VIII below.\n(Consent Decree at 13, ยง VII, ยถ 31 (Doc. No. 235).)  \na.  Implementation of the โSystem of Careโ\nAs provided in ยถ 31 of the Consent Decree, above, execution of the โsystem of\ncareโ is governed by specific standards and deadlines set forth in the Implementation\nPlan, a separate document.5  (See Order approving Implementation Plan (Doc. No. 265).) \nThe Implementation Plan ultimately was approved by the court on November 1, 1993. \n(Order approving Implementation Plan (Doc. No. 265)); (Order Regarding\nImplementation and the Implementation Plan) (Doc. No. 266).)  The Implementation Plan\nwas developed to effectuate a manageable and cost-effective plan with specified\ndeadlines to achieve the massive reforms required for DHR to incorporate into its child\nwelfare system the goals and principles of the Consent Decree.  (Consent Decree\nยถยถ 64-68 (Doc. No. 235).)  Therein, the parties agreed to a phased-in โconversionโ\nprocess, meaning that each year specified counties were to be โconvertedโ until all\n5 The Implementation Plan is the plan required by paragraphs 64-68 of the Consent\nDecree.  (See Consent Decree ยถยถ 20, 64-68.)  By the express terms of the Consent\nDecree, the Implementation Plan is incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree.\n10\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 11 of 148(cid:10)\ncounties achieved โconversionโ status.6  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1034.  As\ndiscussed in the next section, each of Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties has been evaluated,\nand, at the time of evaluation, each county was declared โconverted.โ\nb.  The Termination Clause\nThe Consent Decree contains a termination clause which provides the ultimate\nstandard by which the court is to measure whether the required system of care has been\nestablished and whether the Consent Decreeโs goals and principles have been\naccomplished.  As embodied in the Consent Decree and voluntarily agreed to by\nDefendant, two questions must be answered in Defendantโs favor in order for the court to\nterminate the Consent Decree.  Specifically, the termination clause of the Consent Decree\nprovides as follows:\nOn or after October 1, 2002, the defendant may move for termination of\nthis Decree upon a showing that DHR is in substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the Decree and of the Implementation Plan and that DHR\nwill remain in substantial compliance after termination of the injunction in\nthis case.\n6 The preface to the โConversionโ chapter of the Implementation Plan provides: \nโThis chapter describes the conversion (change) process that will be utilized to convert\nDHR child welfare operations to compliance with this decree.โ  (Implementation Plan,\nConversion Chapter, page 1.)  โConvertedโ means that a county has โchange[]d [its]\npractice to comply with the consent decree.โ  (Order Regarding Implementation and\nImplementation Plan at 3 (Doc. No. 266).)  The method used by the court monitor to\nevaluate whether a county had converted to practice in accordance with the principles of\nthe Consent Decree is set out on pages five through seven of the court monitorโs\nNovember 2005 Report and is summarized herein in a subsequent subsection of this\nopinion.  (Doc. No. 783.) \n11\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 12 of 148(cid:10)\n(Consent Decree ยถ 93, entered June 11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235)), as amended by ยถ 10 of\nConsent Order Extending Time for Compliance, entered Feb. 11, 1999 (โ1999 Consent\nOrderโ) (Doc. No. 511)); see also R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1041.  In order to ascertain\nwhether Defendant has attained the twofold goal of substantial compliance, the court\nmust ascertain the โrequirementsโ of the Consent Decree and of the Implementation Plan. \n(Consent Decree ยถ 93, as amended by the 1999 Consent Order.)\nc.  The Requirements of the Consent Decree\nThe Consent Decreeโs requirements are embodied in the โprinciplesโ or\nโstandards,โ which are set forth in Sections VII and VIII of the Decree.  In R.C. I, the\ncourt organized these principles into five core purposes.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1045-46. \nNeither party has objected to the courtโs categorization.  Those five core purposes are as\nfollows:\n(1) the prevention of out-of-home placements and the advancement of\nfamily unification, but only when at-home placement provides an\nenvironment where the child is safe from imminent and serious harm (core\npurpose one); (2) the delivery of comprehensive services, in a coordinated\nand therapeutic manner, by competent staff with appropriate caseloads, to\nclass members and families in home-based and community-based settings,\ndevised pursuant to individualized service plans (โISPsโ), for the purposes\nof facilitating home placement, satisfying the unique physical, emotional,\nsocial, educational and other needs of class members, and promoting\nsmooth transitions for class members when they โage outโ of the system\n(core purpose two); (3) active participation by the child, parent and foster\nparent in the planning and delivery of services, to include informed\ninvolvement so that the child, parent and foster parent have full\nunderstanding of these services and their rights and options (core purpose\nthree); (4) child safety, encompassing the prevention of sexual abuse and\n12\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 13 of 148(cid:10)\nneglect and the timely intervention and investigation of class members\nbelieved to be victims of sexual abuse and/or neglect (core purpose four);\nand (5) stability and permanency in the class membersโ living situations,\nincluding, if in the childrenโs best interest, that when children are removed\nfrom their homes, siblings are placed together and familial relationships are\nmaintained through visitations and other means (core purpose five). \nId. at 1046 (internal footnote omitted). \n The core purposes of the Consent Decree are not subject to precise definition.  As\nrecognized by the court monitor, the foregoing โrequirementsโ (or โcore purposes,โ as\nphrased by the court) are pliable, and an evaluation of how Defendant is performing in\nthe areas delineated above, at times, requires a measure of discretion and subjectivity.  In\nthis regard, the Consent Decree โrepresent[s] a departure from the more structural\napproach to system reform that ha[s] been used in other system reform settlements,โ (Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 5 (Doc. No. 812)), namely, because its provisions do not\nโspecify[] the precise means for accomplishing [its] ends.โ  (Consent Decree at 2 (Doc.\nNo. 235), as amended by 1999 Consent Order (Doc. No. 511).)  Rather, as set out above,\nthe Consent Decree โlays out a set of โoperating principlesโ or โstandardsโ and directs\ndefendant to ensure that [DHRโs] child protective services and foster care systems\ncomply with these principles or standards by a date certain.โโ  (Id.)\n13\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 14 of 148(cid:10)\n3.  Substantial Compliance\nAlthough the Consent Decree does not define โsubstantial compliance,โ that\ndetermination has not been made in a vacuum.  โAn agreed upon measurement process\nhas been used through[out] the duration of the R.C. Consent Decree to evaluate the\nconsistency, quality, and effectiveness of performance in each county of Alabamaโ during\nthe staggered review process.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 5 (Doc. No. 783).)  In\nthe court monitorโs November 2005 Report and in R.C. I, the โbasic frameworkโ\nemployed was summarized.  (See id. at 5-7);  R.C. I.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1035.  This\nframework, with which the parties and the court are very familiar, was used to determine\nwhether the data and other evidence revealed a level of practice in individual counties\nwhich substantially complied with the principles of the Consent Decree.  Briefly,  \n[t]he basic framework for measurement of the conversion to practice in\naccordance with the system of care has been the detailed review of samples\nof children and families served by the system using a process that is now\nknown as the Quality Service Review (QSR).  The process determines\nwhether the practitioners in the system of care are providing services in\naccordance with the agreed-on standards and with appropriate professional\ndue diligence using a sample of children and families as a test of the system\nperformance (see Appendix A for the specific domains examined).  The\nQSR examines, for example, whether ISPs [individualized service plans]\nand child teams are operating functionally in the manner intended by the\npractice principles.  In addition to the QSR child reviews, the monitor has\n14\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 15 of 148(cid:10)\ntracked quantitative indicators that reflect the performance of system\nprocesses and outcome indicators.7  \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 5 (Doc. No. 783) (brackets supplied) (internal footnote\nomitted) (footnote 7 added)); see also R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1035.  On pages 6 and 7\nof his November 2005 Report, the court monitor further outlines โ[t]he evidence used to\ndetermine that a county is โconvertedโ to practicing in accordance with the principles of\nthe system of care[,]โ see supra footnote 6.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 6-7 (Doc.\nNo. 783).)\nAs revealed, largely up to this point, the focus of the court, the court monitor and\nthe parties has been on the achievement of substantial compliance in individual counties. \nThat focus has been appropriate because achieving the goal of systemwide substantial\ncompliance in a manageable way necessitated that only a few counties undergo scrutiny\neach year.  (See, e.g., Agreement Regarding Implementation ยถ 22 (mandating โphased\nimplementation by geographic areas, by subgroups of class members or bothโ).)  It,\n7 The QSR review is designed to ascertain โthe current status of the child and\nfamilyโ and โthe performance of essential system functions for the child.โ  (Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report, Appendix A (Doc. No. 783).)  A description of the categories which\nare examined as part of the QSR review is contained in Appendix A to the court\nmonitorโs November 2005 Report.  (See id.)  Each category contains a set of โcommon\nsenseโ questions for reviewers to ask.  The categories examined to determine the status of\nchild and family include the following: safety of the child; safety of the caregiver; the\nchildโs stability in daily life and learning; the permanence of residence for the child; the\nchildโs physical and emotional well being; and the childโs learning and developmental\nprogress.  (See id., Appendix B.)  The categories rated to determine system performance\ninclude, among others, functional assessment, long-term view, resource availability and\nagency responsiveness. \n15\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 16 of 148(cid:10)\nhowever, is appropriate at this juncture for the court to state that it finds that the Consent\nDecreeโs termination clause employs the phrase โsubstantial complianceโ as a yardstick\nfor measuring systemwide substantial compliance.  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, entered June\n11, 1991 (Doc. No. 235), as amended by ยถ 10 of the 1999 Consent Order (Doc. No.\n511).)  In other words, the court finds that now faced with the ultimate question of\ntermination of the Consent Decree, the assessment of substantial compliance has more of\na systemwide, as opposed to an individual county, focus.  In pragmatic terms, this means\nthat whether the goal of substantial compliance has been attained systemwide is not\nnecessarily dependent upon every county demonstrating sustained substantial compliance. \nThe court monitor recognized as much in his November 2005 Report, when he stated that\nsubstantial compliance with the Consent Decree requires that โmost countiesโ are\nperforming up to par.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 26 (Doc. No. 783).)  DHR also\nadvocates that the emphasis of โsubstantial complianceโ is on systemwide performance. \nIt does not appear that Plaintiffs would disagree; in their brief arguing a different point,\nPlaintiffs emphasize that the issue for termination of the Consent Decree โwas and is\nstatewide compliance.โ  (Doc. No. 781 at 17 n.8.) \nโSubstantial compliance,โ the guiding phrase used in the Consent Decreeโs\ntermination clause, also has acquired legal meaning from the courts.  In R.C. I, the court\nset out the meaning of โsubstantial compliance,โ as defined and applied by courts faced\nwith motions to terminate consent decrees in institutional reform cases.  See 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1043-45.  The parties have not objected to those principles of law, and those\n16\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 17 of 148(cid:10)\nprinciples again guide the courtโs consideration in resolving the instant motion.  (See,\ne.g., Doc. No. 781 at 4, wherein Plaintiffs describe the courtโs legal discussion as the\nโlaw of the caseโ).  The court need not repeat those principles here, but reemphasizes that\nโsubstantial complianceโ is not 100 percent or strict compliance, but, at the same time,\nโsubstantial complianceโ is not โโsusceptible to a mathematically precise definition.โโ \nR.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1044 (quoting Joseph A. by Wolfe v. N.M. Depโt of Human\nServs., 69 F.3d 1081, 1085 (10th Cir. 1995)).  Indeed, the court must remain mindful that\nthe standard for termination of consent decrees in governmental institutional reform\nlitigation must be โflexible.โ  City of Miami, 2 F.3d at 1503. \nOther factors also bear on the inquiry of whether Defendant has demonstrated\nsubstantial compliance with the core purposes of the Consent Decree.  Some of these\nfactors were set out in R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1043, but bear repeating here.  One\nfactor is whether Defendant has complied in good faith with the terms of the Consent\nDecree since it was entered.  See id.; City of Miami, 2 F.3d at 1503.  This factor involves\nconsideration of Defendantโs record of compliance with the Consent Decree and any\nother positive undertakings by Defendant toward the goal of compliance.  See City of\nMiami, 2 F.3d at 1508.  Another factor is whether the purposes of the litigation have been\nachieved โto the extent practicable.โ  Id.  Relatedly, the court also should consider\nwhether it is necessary or practical for the court to retain judicial control over DHR in\norder to achieve compliance with any outstanding orders.  See Sims, 9 F. Supp.2d\nat 1287.  โ[T]he length of time a consent decree has been effectโ and the โcontinuing\n17\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 18 of 148(cid:10)\nefficacy of the consent decreeโs enforcementโ are two additional factors of which the\ncourt should be informed.  Heath v. DeCourcy, 992 F.2d 630, 633 (6th Cir. 1993) (citing\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 237).  To quote City of Miami, โ[i]n sum, termination of the consent\ndecree would be appropriate if the district court finds that the decree is clearly no longer\nnecessary either to prevent [the constitutional deficiencies] in the future or to remedy the\neffect of past [violations].โ  2 F.3d at 1508. \nB.  Evidentiary Hearing\nIn conjunction with his first motion to terminate the Consent Decree, which was\nthe subject of the courtโs ruling in R.C. I, Defendant complained that he was denied an\nevidentiary hearing and, thus, was denied the opportunity to present evidence in support\nof that motion.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 825 at 2.)  Although Defendant has not expressly\nrequested an evidentiary hearing in connection with the instant โsecondโ motion, given\nhis unrelenting protestations in his present briefs, concerning the courtโs prior denial of\nhis request for a hearing, the court finds that it is appropriate to address Defendantโs\nstatements.  \nWhen he filed his original motion to terminate the Consent Decree, Defendant did\nnot cite any authority in support of his accompanying request for an evidentiary hearing. \nHe did not point to the Consent Decree as his authority for the obvious reason that there\nis no requirement therein that the court hold a hearing prior to terminating the Consent\nDecree.  Moreover, Defendant neither made any showing of what type of evidence would\n18\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 19 of 148(cid:10)\nbe adduced at a hearing, if permitted, nor made a proffer of any material disputed factual\nissues which would have justified presentation through the format of a hearing.  Rather,\nDefendant generically made a request for a hearing, but otherwise insisted that the court\nmonitorโs 61-page November 2004 Report demonstrated that Defendant had satisfied his\ntwofold burden under the Consent Decreeโs termination clause.8  For all of the reasons\npreviously espoused by the court in R.C. I, that Report was woefully inadequate to\nsustain Defendantโs burden.9  In short, the court declined to hold a hearing merely for the\nsake of having a hearing because an undefined request for one was made by Defendant.  \nDefendant has not specifically requested a hearing in connection with his present\nmotion.  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, essentially advocate that the court can deny the\nmotion on the written record, but cannot grant the motion without holding a hearing. \n(See Doc. No. 767 at 1, 3.)  The court, however, finds again that a hearing only would\nprove to be superfluous and would not aid the court in its decisional process.  The court\nhas been immersed in this case for more than a decade and has an in-depth knowledge of\n8 The court monitorโs November 2004 Report was introduced in evidence at the\nDecember 9, 2004 status conference.  (See Doc. No. 723, minute entry.)\n9 As recognized by Defendant in one of his recent filings:  โAs this Court observed\nin [R.C. I] . . ., the Monitor failed to provide the court with a systematic review of the\nDefendantโs compliance with the Decree.  The Monitorโs Report entirely overlooked\nseveral requirements of the Decree.โ  (Doc. No. 779 at 7.)\n19\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 20 of 148(cid:10)\nthe case.10  Throughout the duration of this litigation, the court has received frequent\nstatus reports from the court monitor and has reviewed the extensive filings by the\nparties.\n Moreover, the court finds that there is a developed record in this case.  In this\nregard, the parties have had the opportunity to conduct discovery in connection with\nDefendantโs โsecondโ motion (see Sept. 2, 2005 Order (Doc. No. 768)), to amass\nevidence in support of their positions for and against termination of the Consent Decree,\nand to file that evidence with the court.  The record is replete with evidence and\narguments from the parties, and the facts and data are extensive. \nThe court further finds that the material evidence is undisputed.  In this regard, the\ncourt finds that, as in the past, the issues turn on an interpretation of the Consent Decree\nand whether the material evidence is sufficient under the Consent Decree to warrant its\ntermination.11  The authority cited by Plaintiffs (see Doc. No. 767 at 17 n.5) does not\nsupport their argument that, under the circumstances presented in this case and described\nabove, a hearing is either mandated or warranted.  Cf. Cody v. Hillard, 139 F.3d 1197,\n1200 (8th Cir. 1998) (observing the absence of authority that โa hearing is a necessary\n10 The undersigned has presided over the implementation of the Consent Decree\nfor more than ten years, with the skilled assistance of the court monitor, having inherited\nthis case in 1996 from another judge of this court, the Honorable Truman M. Hobbs,\nSenior United States District Judge.\n11 The court observes that the facts and data rarely have been in dispute, as the\nissues largely have focused on whether those facts and data legally are sufficient to fulfill\nDefendantโs burden under the Consent Decree. \n20\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 21 of 148(cid:10)\nprerequisite to terminating supervision over a [consent] decree (as opposed to modifying\na decree)โ and stating that โthe necessity of a hearing depends on whether there are\ndisputed factual issuesโ). \nC.  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nWhile the court finds that an evidentiary hearing is not warranted, this finding\ndoes not in any way abdicate the courtโs responsibility to provide the parties with a\nsufficient explanation of the facts and reasons underlying its ruling.  Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 246 (observing that, โ[i]f . . . a [consent] decree is to be terminated or dissolved,\nrespondents . . . are entitled to a [precise] statement from the courtโ).  As stated by the\nSixth Circuit, a district court, which is considering whether to terminate a consent decree,\nโshould make sufficiently detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law under Rule\n52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., to advise the parties of the factual basis for its decision and permit\ninformed appellate review.โ  Bradley v. Milliken, 772 F.2d 266, 272 (6th Cir. 1985); see\nalso Joseph A. by Wolfe, 69 F.3d at 1089 (vacating and remanding judgment for failure\nof lower court โto make the specific and clear findings requiredโ by Rule 52(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure).  This opinion constitutes the courtโs findings of fact\nand conclusions of law in accordance with the foregoing dictates.\n21\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 22 of 148(cid:10)\nIV.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND\nThe extensive background of this case is very familiar to the parties and the court\nand is recited in the courtโs prior opinion in which the court denied Defendantโs first\nmotion to terminate the Consent Decree.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1034-41.  A\ndetailed updating of that background is not necessary here, and the court refers the reader\nto its prior opinion.  \nA.  Brief Summary of R.C. I\nIn R.C. I, the court found that Defendant had not met his twofold burden for\ntermination of the Consent Decree because the evidence did not demonstrate that\nDefendant was and would remain in substantial compliance with the requirements of the\nConsent Decree and of the Implementation Plan, as required for termination of the\ninjunction in this case.  The court set out in detail its conclusion that, in light of the\ngoverning law, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that those\nrequirements, which the court distilled into five core purposes (as set out in the previous\nsection of this opinion), had been achieved.  Consequently, the court rejected the ultimate\nrecommendation of the court monitor in his November 2004 Report that โthe court find\nthat DHR is in substantial compliance with the Consent Decreeโ and โthat the\n22\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 23 of 148(cid:10)\nindependent monitoring of the Consent Decreeโ cease.12  R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1059. \nAs detailed in its prior opinion, the court was โunable to reconcile the court monitorโs\nrecommendation of โsubstantial complianceโ with the data and other information in the\ncourt monitorโs November 2004 Report.โ  Id. at 1048.  The court also deemed telling the\nfact that the court monitor did not expressly state that he believed DHR โwill remain in\nsubstantial compliance,โ which is the second prong of Defendantโs burden for termination\nof the Consent Decree, but instead advocated continued supervision by the court for a\nperiod of a year to monitor the โareas of performanceโ discussed in his report.  See id.\nat 1058-59 (citing Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 60-61).\nAlthough in R.C. I the court declined to release the court monitor or to terminate\nthe Consent Decree, the court concurred with the recommendation of the court monitor\nthat Defendant file a performance report with the court which โcontain[ed] facts\naddressing the same areas of performance as the monitorโs reportโ and which โinclude[d]\nthe county ratings ordered by the court.โ  Id. at 1058-59; (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report\nat 61.)  In R.C. I, the court set a deadline of August 4, 2005, for the filing of the\nperformance report and stated that, at that time, โDefendant may renew his motion to\nterminate the Consent Decree and Implementation Plan,โ if the evidence supports such a\nmotion.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1059.\n12 The court monitor, whose has been instrumental to the success of the\nimplementation of the Consent Decree, has assisted the court for more than a decade. \nThe court monitorโs role and responsibilities are set out by the court in its prior opinion. \nSee R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1034-35.\n23\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 24 of 148(cid:10)\nB.  Orders and Pleadings Filed after R.C. I\nThe court now picks up where its prior opinion left off.  On August 3, 2005,\nDefendant complied with the courtโs directives issued in R.C. I and, consequently, filed\nthe instant โsecond motion for order terminating the Consent Decree,โ which is\naccompanied by a plethora of evidence.  (Doc. No. 761.)  On August 29, 2005, Plaintiffs\nsubmitted an opposition to Defendantโs motion, attaching their own evidence and\nrequesting discovery should the court not be inclined to deny the motion outright.  (Doc.\nNo. 767 at 1, 7, 17-18.)  \nAfter reviewing the partiesโ submissions, the court entered an order, directing the\ncourt monitor to file by November 18, 2005, a report responding to all assertions in\nDefendantโs second motion to terminate the Consent Decree and in Plaintiffsโ response. \n(Sept. 2, 2005 Order at 1 (Doc. No. 768).)  The courtโs order further provided, โThe court\nmonitor shall provide specific and detailed discussion of whether he believes that\nDefendant has met both prongs of the twofold burden for termination of the consent\ndecree and shall include particularized references to an analysis of the evidence which\njustifies his conclusions.โ  (Id.)  In the same order, the court also authorized Plaintiffs and\nDefendant to engage in limited discovery for a period of two months, (id. at 2), and\npermitted the parties to file any additional evidence and/or further arguments in support\n24\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 25 of 148(cid:10)\nof their respective positions pertaining to the second motion to terminate the Consent\nDecree.13  (See id.)  \nIn compliance with the courtโs order of September 2, 2005, Plaintiffs and\nDefendant filed briefs and evidence in support of their respective positions regarding\ntermination of the Consent Decree, and the court monitor filed a 64-page report.14  (Doc.\nNos. 779, 781, 783.)  To briefly summarize, in his November 2005 report, the court\nmonitor found that the then โcurrent data,โ primarily arising from QSR โsustainability\nreviewsโ (see supra footnote 7), was insufficient to demonstrate that DHR was\ncomplying with the five core purposes of the Consent Decree.  Although the court\nmonitor praised DHRโs accomplishments, the court monitor concluded that the data was\nโnot consistent with the achievement of Core Purpose One,โ that the QSR reviews\nshowed โsignificant weaknesses in performanceโ of individualized service plans (โISPsโ)\n(core purpose two), that essentially there was no โquantitative dataโ to support Core\nPurpose Three, and that โ[t]he [then] current evidence for achievement of Core Purpose\nFive [was] mixed.โ  Core Purpose Four received a positive review from the court\n13 The court notes that, after the entry of the courtโs September 2, 2005, order the\nparties could not agree on certain discovery matters, thereby prompting Plaintiffs to file a\nmotion to compel Defendantโs production of certain records of individual class members. \n(Doc. No. 777.)  The court heard oral argument on the motion on December 6, 2005. \n(Doc. Nos. 782, 786.)  The court granted in part and denied in part the motion to compel. \n(See Doc. No. 785.) \n14 Henceforth, the court refers to the court monitorโs submission as the โNovember\n2005 Report.โ\n25\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 26 of 148(cid:10)\nmonitor.  (Id. at 56-59.)  In his conclusion, the court monitor stated that โ[t]here are\nparticular weaknesses in the achievement of Core Purposes Two and Three [which] are\nan underpinning for achieving the other core purposes.โ  (Id. at 59-60.)\nThe court monitor explained that all sixty-seven of Alabamaโs counties at one\npoint in time had successfully โconvertedโ their child welfare practices in conformity\nwith the core purposes of the Consent Decree and that the counties had established the\ninfrastructure or โbuilding blocksโ necessary to support compliance with the second\nprong of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause.  The court monitor, however,\nconcluded that the then existing data showed a โlack of consistency [by the counties] in\nmeeting the core purposes.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 9, 60-61 (Doc. No. 783).) \nThe court monitor observed that a more accurate analysis of the second prong of the\nConsent Decree \nwould require on-site work in a sample of counties to verify current\ncaseloads, [to] conduct additional QSR reviews of a significant sample of\nchildren, and to compare the findings to the quantitative data, qualitative\ndata, and stakeholder input provided at the time of the determination of\nconversion to the current performance levels.\n26\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 27 of 148(cid:10)\n(Id. at 64.)  In his November 2005 report, the court monitor emphasized the importance of\non-site reviews during the โconversionโ process.15  After careful study of Defendantโs and\nPlaintiffsโ submissions and the court monitorโs report, the court entered an order on\nDecember 15, 2005 (Doc. No. 787), in which it concurred with the court monitorโs\nrecommendation and directed the court monitor \nto perform on-site work in a random and representative sample of counties\nin order to verify current caseloads, to conduct additional QSR reviews of a\nrandom and representative sample of children, and to compare the findings\nto the quantitative data, qualitative data, and stakeholder input provided at\nthe time of the determination of conversion to present.  The court monitor\nshall determine the method for generating a random and representative\nsample of counties and children to accomplish his purposes of evaluating\nDefendantโs level of compliance with the terms of the consent decree, and,\nif desired, he may seek input from counsel for Plaintiffs and Defendant. \n(Doc. No. 787 at 2.)  \nThe court set a deadline of February 28, 2006, for the court monitor to complete\nhis reviews and submit a report of his findings.  (Id.)  In the same order, the court stated\n15 The court monitor stated:\n[Q]uantitative indicators are inadequate alone to assess whether practice is\noccurring with due diligence and in accordance with the principles of the\nR.C. reform.  For example, the number of children entering care may be\nincreasing or decreasing.  A trend in either direction may or may not be a\npositive indicator of performance and one must analyze the underlying case\npractice to determine whether practice is occurring in accordance with the\nprinciples and with due diligence.\n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 57 (Doc. No. 783).)\n27\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 28 of 148(cid:10)\nthat it would โhold in abeyanceโ Defendantโs second motion to terminate the Consent\nDecree until the completion of these reviews.  (Id. at 3.)  Subsequently, over objection by\nDefendant (Doc. Nos. 788, 791, 792), but based upon the court monitorโs representation\nthat, logistically, it was not possible to complete the reviews by the February 28 deadline,\nthe court, after holding a telephone conference on the matter (Doc. Nos. 793-94),\nextended the court monitorโs deadline to March 31, 2006, to conduct the court-ordered\non-site reviews and to April 21, 2006, to submit his report to the court.  (Doc. No. 803\nat 1-2); (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 1 (Doc. No. 812).) \nC.  The Court Monitorโs 2006 On-Site Sustainability Reviews\nThe court monitor sought input from both Defendant and Plaintiffs regarding the\nprocess for completing the court-ordered reviews.16  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 2\n(Doc. No. 812).)  Ultimately, the court monitor selected the following ten counties to be\nreviewed:  Chambers, Randolph, Conecuh, Jackson, Lauderdale, Lee, Montgomery,\nMacon, Marshall and Jefferson.  These counties comprise three small counties, four mid-\nsized counties and three large counties.  The total number of children included in the\nreviews was 152, and, for each county, the court monitor โevenly split as much as\npossibleโ the number of children in foster care and the number under protective\n16 Henceforth, the court refers to the court monitorโs reviews conducted in 2006 as\nthe โ2006 on-site sustainability reviews.โ\n28\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 29 of 148(cid:10)\nsupervision.  (See id. at 3.)  No serious argument has been advanced by either Defendant\nor Plaintiffs that these ten counties and the children in those counties whose cases were\nscrutinized are not โrandomโ and โrepresentativeโ of the state as a whole.  (Doc. No. 787\nat 2.)\nThe court monitor completed his reviews by the March 31, 2006 deadline, and\ntimely filed his report on April 21, 2006.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report (Doc. No.\n812).)  In his April 2006 Report, the court monitor explains that he employed the โreview\nmethodology followed during previous compliance reviews,โ (id. at 2), and that the\nโ[s]ample sizes of children within the respective counties are comparable to the number\nused by the monitor during his previous on-site reviews.โ  (Id. at 3.)  These sample sizes\nalso are larger than the number of children included in the QSR reviews, which received\nsome criticism from the court in R.C. I.17  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1048-49.  โThe\nmethodology included completing QSRs on a randomly selected sample of children in\neach county, review[ing] . . . quantitative county data, and conducting a series of focus\n17  The court notes that, although in R.C. I, the court offered some criticism of the\nQSR reviews (referred to in R.C. I as the SQA sustainability reviews) as a predictable\nindicator of systemwide compliance (primarily based upon the court monitorโs own\nvaluation of the reviews), see, e.g., id. at 1048-49, the court recognizes that these reviews\nare one of the strengths of DHRโs system of care and, importantly, are but one of many\ncomponents which DHR employs to evaluate and monitor the performance of individual\ncounties.  (See, e.g., Larry Dean Aff. ยถยถ 7-11 (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761) (discussing\nDHRโs multifaceted review mechanisms of counties)); (see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005\nReport at 25-26 (โIn the 2004 monitorโs report to the court, it was suggested that the\nsample sizes of case reviews be increased in order for more generalizability of the case\nreview findings.  The monitor recognizes that, as described in Mr. Deanโs affidavit, a\nvariety of sources are used to measure outcomes for counties.โ) (Doc. No. 783).)\n29\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 30 of 148(cid:10)\ngroups with county staff and local childrenโs community stakeholders.โ18  (Ct. Monitor\nApril 2006 Report at 2 (Doc. No. 812).)  \nThese 2006 on-site sustainability reviews required the retention and work of many\nreviewers.  To decrease expenses and at the urging of Defendant, the court monitor\nagreed to use 50 percent of reviewers provided by DHR.  (See id. at 3.)  The court\nmonitor chose the other 50 percent of reviewers, whom at the time of his selection he\ndeemed more trained and experienced than the DHR reviewers.  (Id.)  Ultimately, though,\nthe court monitor concluded that the reviews performed by the โindependent reviewers\nand the DHR reviewers were conducted with diligence[,] and the findings were closely\ncomparable and accurate.โ  (Id.)  The 2006 on-site sustainability reviews also included\nbetween fifty and one hundred interviews in each county (with more interviews\nconducted in Jefferson County) with key stakeholders in the child welfare system.  (Id.\nat 4.)  The format for stakeholder interviews paralleled the typical format used by the\ncourt monitor during the original on-site compliance reviews.  Key stakeholders included\nDHR employees (both management and front-line workers), โlocal providers of services,\nfamily court judges, foster parents, educators, guardian ad litems, DHR attorney[s,]\njuvenile probation officers,โ and law enforcement officials.  (Id.)   \n18 The court monitor is referring to the QSR reviews, which have been the โbasic\nframeworkโ for measuring a countyโs progress under the Consent Decree, (see Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 5 (Doc. No. 783)), and which were a component of the\n2006 on-site sustainability reviews.  These reviews were discussed earlier in this opinion,\nsee, e.g., supra footnote 7. \n30\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 31 of 148(cid:10)\nIn his April 2006 report (see Doc. No. 812), discussed in more detail later in this\nopinion, the court monitor outlines his conclusions that seven of the ten counties are\nsustaining performance consistent with the principles of the Consent Decree.  These\ncounties are Chambers, Randolph, Conecuh, Jackson, Lauderdale, Lee and Montgomery. \nIn the court monitorโs opinion, however, three counties are not sustaining, one small-, one\nmedium- and one large-sized county, i.e., Macon, Marshall and Jefferson counties,\nrespectively.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 89 (Doc. No. 812).)  He stops short\nof rendering an express finding of substantial compliance as a whole, but states that โ[t]he\nfindings of the ten county reviews are consistent with the findings and issues reported in\nthe monitorโs September 2005 report to the court,โ (i.e., Doc. No. 783), a report in which\nhe concluded that Defendant had not demonstrated the second prong of the Consent\nDecreeโs termination clause.  (Id. at 94.)  \nV.  DISCUSSION\nThe court independently has reviewed the evidence, as it always has done, and for\nthe reasons articulated below, determines that there is evidentiary and legal support for a\nfinding that Defendant has satisfied both prongs of the Consent Decreeโs termination\nclause.  The court emphasizes that it has considered all of the evidence in reaching its\nfindings.  The omission of any reference or discussion to any discrete fact, exhibit or\nother evidence, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that the court ignored or did\n31\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 32 of 148(cid:10)\nnot weigh that evidence.  The court has weighed both the negative and the positive\nevidence, and the court is cognizant of Plaintiffsโ criticisms.  The court, however, has\ndiscerned that these criticisms are not serious enough to foreclose a finding of substantial\ncompliance or to call into doubt Defendantโs ability to remain in substantial compliance\nin the future. \n    \nA.  Analysis of Substantial Compliance under the \nFirst Prong of the Termination Clause of the Consent Decree\nThe first prong of the termination clause of the Consent Decree mandates that\nDefendant demonstrate that โDHR is in substantial compliance with the requirements of\nthe Decree and of the Implementation Plan[.]โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, entered June 11,\n1991 (Doc. No. 235), as amended by ยถ 10 of the 1999 Consent Order (Doc. No. 511).) \nFor the reasons to follow, the court finds that Defendant has demonstrated substantial\ncompliance under the first prong.\nPursuant to the Implementation Plan, the parties agreed that the principles of the\nConsent Decree would be phased in by geographic areas, namely counties, and that โeach\nfiscal year an identified group of counties [would] be โconverted.โโ  (Order Regarding\nImplementation and Implementation Plan at 3 (Doc. No. 266).)  Although DHR was\nunable to attain conversion in all counties by the original agreed-upon deadline of\nOctober 1, 1999, (see Consent Decree ยถ 66), that goal finally was reached on March 11,\n32\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 33 of 148(cid:10)\n2005.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1035-36, 1046 (describing the extensions of\ndeadlines and the final attainment of conversion in all sixty-seven counties).  Through the\ncourt monitorโs thorough and systematic evaluation of each county in Alabama, each\ncounty has reformed its child welfare practices and has demonstrated that it can provide\ncare for its children in a manner which conforms to the requirements of the Consent\nDecree.  The court monitor has stated that the findings that each county, at the time of\nโconversion,โ was โsubstantially in complianceโ with the Consent Decree constitute the\nโprimary support for finding compliance with prong one of the Consent Decree.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 7 (Doc. No. 783).)  The court also recognized this great\nachievement, stating in R.C. I that โthe fact that the court monitor has declared each and\nevery county โconvertedโ is monumental, as paragraph 31 of the Consent Decree\nanticipated a county-by-county conversion, pursuant to staggered deadlines set out in the\nImplementation Plan.โ  390 F. Supp.2d at 1046-47.\nThe court monitor also has cited, in general terms, Defendantโs abidance with the\nmandated obligations in the Implementation Plan and with the courtโs orders entered\nthroughout this litigation and, in specific terms, has stated that DHR has implemented the\nโinfrastructureโ required by the Implementation Plan, which is necessary to support\n33\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 34 of 148(cid:10)\npractice in accordance with the Consent Decree.19  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report\nat 9, 25, 60 (Doc. No. 783)); (see, e.g., Order Regarding Implementation and\nImplementation Plan at 7-9 (Doc. No. 266)); (Implementation Plan, Infrastructure, at 1);\n(see also Doc. No. 761 at 9.) \nPlaintiffs have not presented any detailed challenge to the court monitorโs\nconclusion that prong one of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause has been satisfied. \nRather, Plaintiffs, as well as Defendant, devote the majority of their discussions in their\nbriefs to the second prong of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause, focusing on\nโsustainable substantial compliance,โ to borrow Plaintiffsโ phraseology.  (Doc. No. 781\nat 3.)  Indeed, in recent years, it appears that an understanding has evolved, if not express\nthen implied, that Defendant would satisfy the first prong of the Consent Decreeโs\ntermination clause when the last of Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties attained โconversionโ\nstatus, which as stated occurred on March 11, 2005.20  \n19 Some aspects of the infrastructure are set out on pages 9 and 10 of the court\nmonitorโs November 2005 Report and include:  โemployment of senior level staff in the\nstate office to develop the various aspects of the system,โ such as โquality assurance,\npolicy, licensing standards, resource development, and financingโ; โthe capacity to work\nwith counties when they are determined to be deficient based on quality assurance\nreviews or some discrepant dataโ; the ability to โtrack[] and adjust[] staffing to address\ncaseload issuesโ; and โquality assurance processes to examine countiesโ performance,\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 9-10 (Doc. No.\n783).)\n20 The court says โat the latestโ because in the past Defendant maintained that\nโsubstantial complianceโ was not contingent upon a declaration by the court monitor that\neach county had reformed its practices to conform with the requirements of the Consent\nDecree.  Defendantโs latter argument obviously is moot at this point.\n34\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 35 of 148(cid:10)\nBased on the foregoing discussion and the courtโs independent evaluation of the\nrecord, the court concurs with the court monitorโs recommendation that Defendant has\nsatisfied the requirements of prong one of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause.  The\ncourt bases its decision upon the evidence in the record, as highlighted above, and the\nremarkable fact that the child welfare practices in every county in Alabama have been\nscrutinized and have been declared โconverted.โ  The court also bases its finding on its\nconcurrence with the court monitor that DHR effectively has overhauled its pre-R.C.\npractices and has implemented an infrastructure which is sufficient to support a system of\ncare which incorporates all of the core purposes of the Consent Decree.  Other of DHRโs\naccomplishments, which the court finds further amplify Defendantโs demonstration of\nsubstantial compliance under prong one, are set out in the court monitorโs November\n2004 Report.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 2, 58-59); (see also Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report at 9, 60 (Doc. No. 783).)  \nThe court also finds that it is fitting at this point to spotlight the fact that a\ncommon theme emanates and predominates in the extensive record and that theme is that\nthe parties and the court monitor have effectuated remarkable and demonstrable\nimprovements in DHRโs child welfare system.  DHRโs child welfare system is, no doubt,\nfar different and far better today than it was at the time that this litigation commenced. \nThe quality of care which children under DHRโs supervision receive has improved\nsubstantially.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 781 at 2 (although arguing against termination of the\n35\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 36 of 148(cid:10)\nConsent Decree, plaintiffs state that โall would agreeโ that there has been โnotable\nimprovement since the entry of the Consent Decree in 1991โ).)  With that said, the court\nrecognizes that Plaintiffs take strong issue with DHRโs compliance with prong two of the\nConsent Decreeโs termination clause, as they aptly state that the material question is not\nwhether โthe system now treats children better than it did in 1988.โ  (Doc. No. 820 at 3.) \nIt is appropriate now for the court to turn to a discussion of the second prong.  As should\nbe evident from the courtโs discussion below, the court has given very serious\nconsideration to whether the evidence demonstrates that DHR has satisfied prong two of\nthe Consent Decreeโs termination clause.\nB.  Analysis of Substantial Compliance under the \nSecond Prong of the Termination Clause of the Consent Decree\nThe second prong of the termination clause of the Consent Decree requires that\nDefendant demonstrate โthat DHR will remain in substantial compliance after termination\nof the injunction in this case.โ21  (Consent Decree ยถ 93, entered June 11, 1991 (Doc. No.\n21 The court notes that, in his original motion to terminate the Consent Decree,\nwhich was the subject of the courtโs opinion in R.C. I, Defendant consistently argued\nincorrectly that the second prong for termination required that DHR demonstrate that it\nโis likely to remain in substantial compliance.โ  R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1038, 1041-42\n(emphasis added).  The amended termination clause, to which Defendant voluntarily\nagreed in 1999, however, is more stringent.  It requires a demonstration by Defendant that\nDHR โwill remain in substantial compliance after termination of the injunction in this\ncase.โ  (1999 Consent Order ยถ 10 (Doc. No. 511) (emphasis added); R.C. I, 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1036 & n.7.\n36\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 37 of 148(cid:10)\n235), as amended by ยถ 10 of the 1999 Consent Order (Doc. No. 511).)  In R.C. I, the\ncourt stated that, โin [its] opinion, the best evidence to support a finding that DHR โwill\nremain in substantial complianceโ . . . is evidence that, after conversion, counties have\ncontinued to operate in a manner that substantially complies with the Consent Decree.โ \nR.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1058.  In R.C. I, however, the court found that the โevidence\n[was] lackingโ in that regard.  Id.  Plaintiffs complain that DHR has not had ample time\nin the interim between the courtโs May 2005 memorandum opinion and order, denying\nDefendantโs first motion to terminate the Consent Decree, and Defendantโs present filing\nto bring DHRโs child welfare system in compliance with the requirements of prong two\nof the termination clause of the Consent Decree.  (Doc. No. 767 at 3.) \nPlaintiffsโ argument is slightly off-key.  In its May 2005 memorandum opinion and\norder, the courtโs primary reason for denying Defendantโs motion to terminate the\nConsent Decree rested on the conclusion that the court monitorโs report submitted in\nNovember 2004, upon which Defendant heavily relied, contained insufficient data to\nsupport the court monitorโs recommendation of substantial compliance.  In other words, it\nwas unclear whether evidence of substantial compliance existed or not because there\nwere large gaps in the evidentiary proof.  \nNotwithstanding Plaintiffsโ further objection, for the reasons to follow, the court\nfinds that the missing evidence has been supplied and that Defendant has demonstrated\nthat DHR โwill remainโ in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree and the\n37\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 38 of 148(cid:10)\nImplementation Plan after termination of the injunction in this case.22  As discussed\nherein, that evidence is supplied, in part, by the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews which\nwere ordered by the court and conducted by the court monitor. \n1.  Preliminary Findings Concerning the 2006 On-Site Sustainability Reviews and the\nPartiesโ Positions as to what the Reviews Mean in Terms of Substantial Compliance\nInitially, regarding the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, the results of which are\nelaborated upon in the court monitorโs April 2006 Report (Doc. No. 812), the court\nmakes the following findings and observations which hopefully will help clarify what\nissues are not before the court for exhaustive analysis.  \nFirst, the court finds that the results of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews\nconstitute valuable evidence in evaluating the merits of the present motion for the\nfollowing reason.  During the โconversionโ process of each county, the court monitorโs\n22 The court emphasizes that, throughout this litigation, it has greatly valued the\ncourt monitorโs opinions and has relied extensively on the evidence amassed by and the\nrecommendations received from the court monitor.  This deference and respect, however,\nis not a mere rubber stamp.  The court, which is the only one with the authority to\nterminate the Consent Decree (see Consent Decree ยถยถ 86, 91, 93, as amended by 1999\nConsent Order), has independently evaluated the evidence pursuant to the governing law. \nThe court respectfully disagrees with the court monitorโs implicit, but clear,\nrecommendation of non-substantial compliance concerning the second prong of the\nConsent Decreeโs termination clause.  The court emphasizes also that, although the court\ndisagrees with the court monitor as to the propriety of terminating the Consent Decree,\nthe court in no way is questioning the integrity or quality of the court monitorโs work in\nthis case.\n38\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 39 of 148(cid:10)\non-site compliance review was the yardstick by which the court monitor determined if a\ncounty had implemented the required system of care into its child welfare practices and\nhad achieved a level of practice which conformed to the requirements of the Consent\nDecree.  The 2006 on-site sustainability reviews conducted by the court monitor replicate\nthese original on-site compliance reviews.  The court monitor has explained that he\nemployed the same โreview methodologyโ that he used when he initially evaluated each\nof Alabamaโs sixty-seven counties and that the โ[s]ample sizes of children within the\nrespective counties [were] comparable to the number used by the monitor during his\nprevious on-site reviews.โ  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 2-3 (Doc. No. 812).)  As\nrecited earlier herein, in R.C. I, the court set out the methodology underlying the review\nprocess employed by the court monitor in conducting his initial on-site compliance\nreviews, see 390 F. Supp.2d at 1035, and the court finds that the methodology is sound.  \nSecond, the court accepts all of the data articulated by the court monitor in his\nApril 2006 Report.  Neither party has lodged an objection as to the accuracy of this data. \nInstead, Plaintiffs and Defendant essentially argue that the data supports a finding in their\nfavor on the issue of substantial compliance and that the other partyโs interpretation of the\ndata is wrong. \nThird, the court accepts the conclusions reached by the court monitor as to\nwhether or not each of the ten counties reviewed presently is demonstrating substantial\ncompliance.  To reiterate, the court monitor says that, overall, seven counties are\n39\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 40 of 148(cid:10)\nsustaining substantial compliance and that three are not.  Although the court concurs with\nthe court monitor that three counties are not substantially complying with the Consent\nDecree, the court parts ways with the court monitor to the extent that the court monitor is\nrecommending that the court find that DHR has not met its burden under the second\nprong of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause.\n Fourth, the court finds that, when viewed collectively, the ten counties selected\nfor reviews are โrepresentativeโ of the status of the state as a whole. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing findings, the courtโs task has not been a simple one. \nPerhaps, if the court monitor had found that all ten counties had failed or that all had\npassed the โsubstantial complianceโ inquiry, the courtโs job would have been simplified. \nAs it stands, seven counties passed the court monitorโs substantial compliance scrutiny,\ntwo of those seven with marginal but, importantly, passing grades, and three did not pass. \nGiven the varied complex facets of the core purposes, many of which are subjective in\nnature, and the pliancy of the substantial compliance standard, particularly in institutional\nreform cases such as this one, the courtโs task has been more complicated.  It would be\nsuperficial as well to predicate a finding on a pure percentage basis, i.e., to say that a\ncompliance ratio of seven out of ten counties or 70 percent either does or does not equate\nsubstantial compliance, and the court does not understand either party to advance such a\nposition.  (See Doc. No. 820 at 5, 8.)\n40\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 41 of 148(cid:10)\nDefendant argues that โthe overall resultsโ of the 2006 on-site sustainability\nreviews โ[are] impressive and provide solid evidence that (1) [] Defendant has sustained\ncompliance with the Consent Decree for an extended period of time and (2) practice\nunder the RC principles is improving across the state.โ  (Doc. No. 811 at 3.)  Just as\nemphatically, Plaintiffs contend otherwise.  After very careful consideration, the court\nfinds that the evidence in the court monitorโs April 2006 Report (Doc. No. 812), when\nconsidered against the legal principles governing substantial compliance and other\nevidence in the record, legalistically tilts in favor of a finding that Defendant has met its\nburden under prong two of the Consent Decreeโs termination clause.  The court now turns\nto a discussion of the evidence, which the court finds appropriately begins with a\ndiscussion of DHRโs ratings from the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews in the categories\nof โoverall child statusโ and โoverall performance.โ  The court, thereafter, will provide a\nmore specific analysis of the evidence as to each of the five core purposes of the Consent\nDecree; the account of this evidence, however, is not in numerical sequence.\n2.  Ratings:  Overall Child Status and Overall Performance\nDefendant maintains that the rating in the category of  โoverall child statusโ is the\nโsingle most important measure of the effectiveness of the System of Care, because it is\nthe ranking that measures the outcomes for the children under care.โ  (Doc. No. 811 at 4.)\nPlaintiffs do not disagree.  (See Doc. No. 767 at 11 (stating that the overall child status\n41\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 42 of 148(cid:10)\nand overall performance measures โform[ed] the foundation of the Monitorโs\ndetermination of complianceโ during on-site reviews).)  The โoverall child statusโ rating\nassesses โhow wellโ as a whole a โchild [is] presently doingโ based on the thirteen child\nand family status domains which reviewers probe when evaluating a countyโs compliance\nwith the requirements of the Consent Decree.23  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report,\nAppendix A (Doc. No. 783).)  The โoverall child statusโ is measured based upon a\nโspecial scoring procedureโ which uses a โ6-point rating scale.โ  (Id.)  \nIn line with the partiesโ assessment, the court finds that the composite rating\nattributed to the counties, which were part of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, in\nthe category of โoverall child statusโ is a good indicator that, systemwide, children within\nDHRโs care are safe and are doing well and that DHR is sustaining substantial\ncompliance with the Consent Decree.  Impressively, the aggregate โoverall child statusโ\nrating for all ten counties subject to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews was 96\npercent.  (Ct. Monitorโs April 2006 Report at 90, 92 (Doc. No. 812).)  Even the three\ncounties which the court monitor found not to be sustaining substantial compliance โ\nMacon, Marshall and Jefferson counties โ achieved an aggregate โoverall child statusโ\nrating of 93 percent.  (Id. at 92.)  The impressiveness of these ratings is amplified when\n23 Those domains, which were listed supra, in footnote 7, are as follows: safety of\nthe child; safety of the caregiver; stability; maintaining family connections;\nappropriateness of placement; permanence; health/physical well-being; emotional well-\nbeing; education; learning and developmental progress; responsible behavior; caregiver\nfunctioning; family progress toward independence; and satisfaction.  (See Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report, Appendix A (Doc. No. 783).)\n42\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 43 of 148(cid:10)\none considers that, throughout the implementation of the Consent Decree, the court\nmonitor generally has declared a county converted โโwhen 85% of child status and system\nperformance ratings [were] acceptable during an on-site compliance [review].โโ  R.C. I,\n390 F. Supp.2d at 1035; (see also Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 4 (Doc. No. 812).)\nMoreover, Defendant asserts that the rating in the category of โoverall\nperformanceโ constitutes โthe next most important measurement.โ  (Doc. No. 811 at 4 &\nn.4.)  This assertion has not been contradicted.  The composite rating from the 2006 on-\nsite sustainability reviews in the category of โoverall performanceโ shows marked\nimprovement from the evidence which was before the court when it entered R.C. I.24  In\nR.C. I, the limited evidence revealed that fifteen counties had been subjected to QSR\nreviews and that only three of those counties demonstrated an โoverall performanceโ\nrating of 85 percent or better and that, โ[d]isturbingly, five of the fifteen counties received\nratings of only 25 percent.โ  390 F. Supp.2d at 1050 (citing Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 35).  In the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, half of the counties scored 90\n24 The โoverall performanceโ rating is compiled based upon the fourteen domains\nused to measure โcurrent system performance,โ and, as with the โoverall child statusโ\nrating, โ[a] special scoring procedure is used to determine Overall System Performance\nfor a child.โ  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report, Appendix A (Doc. No. 783).)  The\nfourteen domains are: child and family engagement; functional assessment; long-term\nview; individualized service plan (โISPโ); resource availability; ISP implementation;\nfamily preservation services; family support network; service coordination; urgent\nresponse capability; agency responsiveness; successful transitions; monitoring and\nmodification; and effective results.  (Id.)\n43\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 44 of 148(cid:10)\npercent or better, two scored in the eightieth percentile range, and no county scored as\nlow as 25 percent.25 \n3.  Core Purpose One\nCore purpose one is the prevention of out-of-home placements and the\nadvancement of family unification, but only when at-home placement provides an\nenvironment where the child is safe from imminent and serious harm.  In R.C. I, the court\nfound that the evidence in the record at that time revealed that the percentage of children\nin out-of-home care steadily had been increasing since 1995.  The court found, though,\nthat there was insufficient explanation in the record as to the cause of the increase.  The\nevidence was mixed and limited as to whether the increase in out-of-home placements\nwas due to regression in DHRโs standard of care or due to a rise in methamphetamine\nabuse in homes, an external factor outside of DHRโs control.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d\n25 The overall performance ratings of the ten counties (i.e., the percentage of\nacceptable cases in this category) are as follows:  (1) Chambers (100 percent);\n(2) Randolph (100 percent); (3) Conecuh (100 percent); (4) Jackson (90 percent);\n(5) Lauderdale (94 percent); (6) Lee (89 percent); (7) Montgomery (83 percent);\n(8) Macon (50 percent); (9) Marshall (44 percent); and (10) Jefferson (57 percent).  (See\nCt. Monitor April 2006 Report at 11, 18, 26, 34, 42, 51, 59, 67, 76, 86 (Doc. No. 812).)\n44\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 45 of 148(cid:10)\nat 1051-52.  This limited evidence did not assist this court in determining the cause of the\nincrease.26 \nThe court finds that there now is unrefuted evidence indicating that the challenge\nfor counties in the areas of family unification, the prevention of out-of-home placements\n(and the related goal of achieving permanence in a childโs living situation, a component\nof core purpose five) has been sparked largely by an external factor, that is, the rapid\nincrease in the use and production of crystal methamphetamine affecting families in\nAlabama.  Some counties have suffered more than others, but all appear to have suffered. \nFor example, in discussing the current methamphetamine epidemic which plagues\nJackson County, the court monitor states as follows in his April 2006 Report:\nThe major issue affecting practice [in Jackson County] is the rapid increase\nin the presence and use of crystal methamphetamine.  Use and production\nhave increased and are seen in homes with multi-generational use.  Half of\nthe intakes in Jackson County are attributed to crystal methamphetamine. \nIncrease in the number of labs is posing more health risks for children and\nfor workers.  \n(Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 29 (Doc. No. 812).)  Notably, of the ten children who\nwere reviewed in Jackson County, 70 percent of the cases were opened due to substance\n26 The cause is important.  The court would be less concerned, for purposes of\nevaluating DHRโs system of care, if the increase in the number of children receiving out-\nof-home care was the result of a factor outside of DHRโs control, rather than from\ninternal deficiencies in DHRโs system of care.  \n45\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 46 of 148(cid:10)\nabuse.  (Id. at 3.)  In fact, with Conecuh County presenting the only exception, substance\nabuse by a parent was the leading reason in all counties that a case was opened.  \nDefendant also has submitted evidence which reveals that the adverse\nconsequences of the methamphetamine boom have been felt systemwide, and the court\nmonitor has โconcur[red] with DHRโs assessment of the role of methamphetamine[].โ \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 52 (Doc. No. 783).)  The director of Covington\nCounty, for example, attests:  โWork with families in home environment seems to have\nevolved from neglect due to the poverty of being in a rural community to explosive\nmethamphetamine labs.โ  (Aff., Attach. B to Doc. No. 779-3.)  Defendant also submitted\nthe affidavit of Freida Baker (โBakerโ), who signed her statement as DHRโs Deputy\nDirector of the Family Services Division.  (Baker Aff. โ โChildren in Careโ at 2\n(electronically filed as Ex. 36 to Doc. No. 761).)  As noted by Baker, the percentage of\nchildren coming into care as a result of substance abuse increased more than 500 percent\nduring the three years preceding the signing of her affidavit, and โ[t]he complexity of\nsubstance-abusing families presents a national challenge, particularly in the area of\ncrystal-methamphetamine.โ  (Id. at 7.)  \nThe methamphetamine epidemic obviously increases dramatically the influx of\nnew children entering DHRโs child welfare system and strains available resources for\nachieving the goals of keeping children in their homes, maintaining bonds between a\nchildren and their families, and attaining permanence in childrenโs living situations.\n46\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 47 of 148(cid:10)\nChildren who live in a home which is pervaded by methamphetamine use and/or its\nmanufacture are not safe, and their removal from the destructive environment is\nimperative for their safety.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1046 n.18 (reiterating โits\nstrong position that no child is to be placed in a home from which he or she has been\nremoved whereupon return he or she stands any chance of a repetition of the abusive\nbehavior.  If DHR is to err, let it be on the side of the safety of the child, not on the side\nof home unification merely for the sake of bolstering the statistics.โ); (see also\nImplementation Plan, system processes and services, page 5 (โDHR may remove a class\nmember from his home only if it is not possible, through the provision of services\n(including intensive home-based services), to protect the class member from imminent,\nserious harm while living at homeโ).)  \nThe court finds that the persistent and repeated observations by the court monitor\nand the evidence submitted by Defendant concerning the rise in methamphetamine use in\nAlabama and its devastating effect on families and children explain, in large measure, the\nrise in out-of-home placements.  In other words, the court finds that the increase in the\nnumber of children in out-of-home care is not attributable to any systemic defect, but\nrather to an external cause outside of DHRโs control.  The record further indicates that\nthe methamphetamine epidemic is an epidemic which, during the initial conversion\nprocess, was not affecting counties in the same manner as of present.  (See, e.g., Baker\nAff., titled โChildren in Careโ at 7 (electronically filed as Ex. 36 to Doc. No. 761), in\n47\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 48 of 148(cid:10)\nwhich Baker observes that, in 2001, 3.9 percent of Alabama admissions to foster care\nwere due to substance abuse, but that, in 2004, almost 20 percent of admissions into care\nwere the result of family substance abuse).)  \nDefendant obviously must be prepared to mold practices and policies to address\nthis relatively new challenge, as well as any other now-unforeseen future challenges, and\nthere is evidence that it is prepared to do so without court supervision.  To highlight an\nexample, there is evidence that, in Lee County, the director and the staff have developed\na methamphetamine protocol in partnership with law enforcement agencies and the local\nhospital in the community.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 53 (Doc. No. 812).)  \nRelatedly, the evidence reveals that DHR is working hard to maintain family\nconnections.  Bakerโs affidavit provides a synopsis of the services which DHR has\nimplemented as a result of the Consent Decree in an effort to prevent removal of children\nfrom their homes where possible (called โfront-endโ services), including the Family\nOptions Program.  (Baker Aff., titled โChildren in Careโ at 2 (electronically filed as Ex.\n36 to Doc. No. 761).)  The Family Options Program provides immediate, intensive in-\nhome assessment and support for families.  (Id.)  In 2004, this program served 3,038\nchildren from 1,247 families.  (Id. at 5); (see also Def. Aff. ยถ 16A (electronically filed as\nexhibit 5 to Doc. No. 761).)  Similarly, Baker attests that, while out-of-home placements\nhave increased in Alabama, so have the number of children who are served in their\nhomes.  (Baker Aff., titled โChildren in Careโ at 6.)  Indeed, the court monitor\n48\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 49 of 148(cid:10)\ncomplimented Defendant in this area, stating that โthe capacity to deliver home-based\nfamily preservation services was developed and implemented over the duration of the\nConsent Decree.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 15 (Doc. No. 783).)\nThe court also finds that the results from the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews\nreveal notable improvements in the area of family connections.  Prior to these reviews,\nthe available evidence, which was cited in the court monitorโs November 2005 Report,\nrevealed that, although counties โworked diligentlyโ to increase the number of visits\nbetween families and children in care so as to maintain family connections, the QSR\nreviews revealed that only 63 percent of the children included in these aggregate reviews\nhad acceptable ratings in the domain of โmaintaining family connections.โ  (Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report at 14-15 (Doc. No. 783).)  \nTurning to the present record, namely, to the results from the 2006 on-site\nsustainability reviews, the combined performance for the seven sustaining counties in this\ncategory (i.e., maintaining family connections) was 89 percent, and the non-sustaining\ncounties received a combined score of 72 percent.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 90,\n92 (Doc. No. 812).)  The court monitor finds, to use the words of the court monitor, that\nDHR is โtrend[ing] in the expected direction.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 24\n(Doc. No. 783).)  Notably, as to the seven sustaining counties, there were no significant\nproblems noted by the court monitor regarding the countiesโ performance in the areas\ncomprising core purpose one.  \n49\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 50 of 148(cid:10)\nIn sum, the court does not find that the increase in the number of children in\nout-of-home care is an impediment to a finding of substantial compliance as to core\npurpose one, and the court finds that DHR has effectively incorporated core purpose one\ninto its child welfare practices.  Stated differently, the court finds that Defendant has\ndemonstrated that it will remain in substantial compliance with core purpose one after\ntermination of the Consent Decree.\n4.  Core Purpose Four\nChild safety is not only a component of core purpose one, but is the essential focus\nof core purpose four.  Providing a safe haven for children, who are catapulted into DHRโs\nchild welfare system, always has been one of the paramount purposes of the Consent\nDecree and a top priority of the court.  In this regard, the court finds that, although there\nare varied components of the Consent Decree, an estimable barometer for measuring how\nDHRโs child welfare system is functioning as a whole is to look at whether the children\nwho are served by DHR are safe.  The foregoing was implied by the court monitor in his\ninverse statement that children will be safe from harm only โwhen each child and family\nserved is consistently provided with supports and services that are consistently executed\nwith due diligence.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 2 (Doc. No. 783).)  As explained\nherein, the court finds that the evidence indicates that DHR is doing a good job of\n50\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 51 of 148(cid:10)\nprotecting children from harm and is doing so in a manner which substantially complies\nwith the Consent Decree. \nOverall, the court finds that the evidence regarding child safety is very positive. \nAll of the counties which were part of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews scored 90\npercent or better in the category of โsafety of the child.โ27  Previously, the court monitor\nhas observed that โthe strongest dataโ that children are safer now than they were before\nthe commencement of this lawsuit is revealed through this child safety rating on the QSR\nreviews.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 11 (Doc. No. 783).)  \nTurning to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, in five counties โ Chambers,\nRandolph, Jackson, Lauderdale and Montgomery โ 100 percent of the children received\nan acceptable rating in the category of child safety.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report\nat 10, 17, 33, 41, 58 (Doc. No. 812).)  In Chambers County, โ[t]here were no reported\nconcerns with the safety of youth, and safety plans were present where appropriate.โ  (Id.\nat 11, 12.)  The report was equally favorable for Randolph County, where the court\nmonitor observed that childrenโs safety plans are โmonitored closelyโ and that home visits\nby workers occur at least monthly, but often more frequently.  (Id. at 20.)  Similarly, in\n27 Some of the questions probed to evaluate child safety include the following:  โIs\nthe child safe from manageable risks of harm (caused by others or by the child) in his/her\ndaily living, learning, working, and recreational environments?โ; โ[a]re others in the\nchildโs daily environments safe [for] the child?โ; and โ[i]s the child free from\nunreasonable intimidations and fears at home and school?โ  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005\nReport at 30 & Appendix A (Doc. No. 783).)\n51\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 52 of 148(cid:10)\nConecuh and Lauderdale counties, there were no concerns espoused regarding child\nsafety, and, additionally, in Conecuh County, stakeholders expressed their belief โthat\nworkers . . . are keeping children safe.โ  (Id. at 44, 51.) \nMoreover, the remaining five counties โ Conecuh, Lee, Macon, Marshall and\nJefferson โ scored in the ninetieth percentile range for acceptable cases in the category of\nchild safety.  (See id. at 25, 50, 66, 75, 85.)  Even in Macon, Marshall and Jefferson\ncounties, which the court monitor found are not sustaining an overall level of practice\nwhich substantially complies with the Consent Decree, the court finds that these counties\nsatisfy the substantial compliance standard in the area of child safety.  Contrary to\nPlaintiffsโ suggestion made in a similar, but slightly different, context (see Doc. No. 820\nat 7-8), the court finds that โminimally acceptable,โ the phrase used by the court monitor\nto describe Macon, Marshall and Jefferson countiesโ compliance in the area of child\nsafety, means what it says, i.e., that performance levels in the area of child safety satisfy\nthe threshold of substantial compliance, even if only minimally so.  (Ct. Monitor April\n2006 Report at 93 (Doc. No. 812).) \nThe ability of counties to timely investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect\nis another measurement of safety.  As aptly noted by the court monitor, โ[t]he fact that\nthe substantial backlogs of CAN investigations that existed in some counties, and\nparticularly Jefferson county and Mobile county, at the outset of the system reform\nessentially have been eliminated is strong evidence that children are more likely to be\n52\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 53 of 148(cid:10)\nkept safe.โ28  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 11 (Doc. No. 783).)  In R.C. I, the court\nfound that there existed โ[p]ositive data as to core purpose four pertaining to the\nprevention and timely interventions and investigations of class members believed to be\nvictims of sexual abuse and/or neglect,โ 390 F. Supp.2d at 1054, and the courtโs finding\nremains the same.  In R.C. I, the court explained:\n[S]ome โquantitative indicatorsโ as to whether or not DHR is ensuring child\nsafety are revealed through data compiled by DHR regarding the number of\nchild abuse and neglect (โCANโ) reports received, the timeliness of contact\nto these reports, and the timeliness of the resolution of the CAN report. \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 39.)  According to the court monitor, the\ndata demonstrates a steady and notable increase in the percentage of cases\nhaving initial CAN contacts within the required five days.  (Id.)  To\nDefendantโs credit, there is data that, in 91.4 percent of cases, DHR\ncaseworkers are making contact with children who are the subject of CAN\nreports within five days, and percentages of initial CAN contacts have\naveraged approximately 90 percent during the previous three years.  (Id.\nat 41.)  The court monitor observes that these figures represent a\nโconsiderable increase since 1997โ when only 49 percent of children were\ncontacted by a social worker within five days.  (Id.)\n390 F. Supp.2d at 1054.  \nFurthermore, the statements provided by community stakeholders reveal that\ncounty staff members have developed strong, positive working relationships with law\nenforcement.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 12, 20, 36, 44, 53, 78 (Doc.\nNo. 812).)  In Marshall County, for example, โ[l]aw enforcement spoke very highly of\nDHR and reported that [it was] responsive and cooperative.โ  (Id. at 78.)  Also, in\n28 โCANโ denotes child abuse and neglect reports.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d\nat 1054.\n53\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 54 of 148(cid:10)\nJackson County, which as discussed earlier in this opinion has been hard hit by the ill\neffects of methamphetamine abuse, stakeholders described strong collaboration between\nDHR staff and law enforcement, judges and guardian ad litems.  (See id. at 36.)  The\ncourt monitor observed that, in Jackson County, law enforcement and DHR staff โwork\nwell together when methamphetamine[] [is] involvedโ and that โ[l]aw enforcement has\nbeen diligent with training DHR staff regarding home visit safety.โ29  (Id.)  The court\nagain commends Defendant for DHRโs continued โability and willingness to respond\nimmediately to any complaint concerning child safety, as well as to cooperate with\nmunicipal, county and state law enforcement [and federal law enforcement, where\nindicated] in all matters pertaining to child endangerment and the prevention of the\nsame.โ  R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1033 (brackets added).  \nIn finding that DHR has demonstrated substantial compliance with core purpose\nfour, the court is not insensitive to the recently-reported death in Jefferson County of a\nchild, who had been returned to his motherโs care, but who nonetheless was under DHRโs\nwatch, and another case where it was alleged that DHR failed to investigate a report of\nchild abuse.  (See Doc. No. 767 at 12); (Doc. No. 820 at 21.)  The court also is cognizant\nof DHRโs representation to the court of the measures employed to address the reported\n29 In this regard, it is recommended that DHR implement policy or law which gives\nemployees of DHR the authority of a deputy sheriff and allows them to carry firearms in\nand about the performance of their duties, provided the employees are certified to do so\nby the Commissioner and have qualified, with an appropriate weapon, on an approved\nfiring range as either marksman, sharpshooter or expert.\n54\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 55 of 148(cid:10)\nincident of abuse, which DHR states included an investigation and the imposition of\ndisciplinary actions against employees and the county director.  (See Doc. No. 779 at 12.) \nAfter careful consideration, the court finds that the record does not support the conclusion\nthat these tragedies exemplify systemwide failures, as opposed to โisolatedโ occurrences. \nWyatt v. Rogers, 985 F. Supp. 1356, 1388 (M.D. Ala. 1997).  Although Plaintiffs take a\ncontrary position than that of the court, Plaintiffs have admitted that a failure in an\nindividual case, even a tragic one, does not, โin and of itself, demonstrate[]\nnoncompliance.โ  (Doc. No. 767 at 12.)  Although the court, and certainly DHR, desires\nevery child in every county to achieve optimal success under DHRโs system of care, the\ncourt realizes that such a goal is neither realistic nor possible, and this is the reason the\nConsent Decree embodies a standard of substantial, rather than complete, compliance.30  \nAs a final observation, the court commends DHR for its success in the outcome of\nchild safety on a national study.  In a United States government study conducted by the\nChildrenโs Bureau and the Administration for Children and Families, located within the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (โDHHSโ), the State of Alabama\nachieved substantial conformity within the safety outcome titled โChildren are, first and\nforemost, protected from abuse and neglect.โ  R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1054 n.31 (citing\n30 To illustrate further, when the individual counties were going through the\nโconversionโ process, there unfortunately were instances where individual children were\nnot being served satisfactorily under the countyโs system of care; however, pursuant to\nthe court monitorโs 85 percent measuring stick, those failures were not a bar to a finding\nof substantial compliance.\n55\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 56 of 148(cid:10)\nCt. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 53); (see also Betty Ziri Aff. (Ex. 34 to Doc. No. 761)\n(discussing generally the review process)); (Exs. 35 & 36 to Doc. No. 761).)  Although\nthe court recognizes that the DHHS standards do not supplant the terms of the Consent\nDecree, as Plaintiffs readily have pointed out (see Doc. No. 835 at 1; Doc. No. 767 at 9),\nthe court observes that the DHHS reviews incorporate a methodology similar to that\nemployed by the court monitor; the DHHS reviews integrate data analysis and individual\ncase reviews, with ratings assessed based upon โthe federal review instrument and\ninterviews of key stakeholders of [DHRโs] system.โ  (Paul Butler Aff. (Doc. No. 836 &\nAttachment 3 to Doc. No. 811)); (see also Dean Aff. ยถยถ 4, 7 (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761).)\nBased on the foregoing, the court finds that overall DHR is keeping children safe. \nThe court finds Defendant has demonstrated that DHR will remain in substantial\ncompliance with core purpose four of the Consent Decree after court supervision ends.  \n5.  Core Purpose Two:  Service Delivery and Competent Staff\nCore purpose two embodies a multitude of important aims of the Consent Decree.\nCore purpose two provides:  The delivery of comprehensive services, in a coordinated\nand therapeutic manner, by competent staff with appropriate caseloads, to class members\nand families in home-based and community-based settings, devised pursuant to ISPs, for\nthe purposes of facilitating home placement, satisfying the unique physical, emotional,\nsocial, educational and other needs of class members, and promoting smooth transitions\n56\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 57 of 148(cid:10)\nfor class members when they โage outโ of the system.  The court turns now to an\nexamination of core purpose two.\na.  Service Delivery\nOne of the important principles of the Consent Decree, i.e., a component of a well-\nfunctioning system of care, is that โchildren and families should have access to an array\nof services that . . . address individual, physical, emotional, social, and education needs.โ \n(See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 3.)  The court monitor found, and the court\nconcurs, that โDHR has developed an array of services necessary to implement the\nsystem of care.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 9 (Doc. No. 783).)  These services are\nextensive.  Some are discussed in Bakerโs and Defendantโs affidavits.  (See Baker Aff.,\ntitled โChildren in Careโ at 2-6 (electronically filed as Ex. 36 to Doc. No. 761)); (Def.\nAff. ยถยถ 12, 15 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761).)31  Therapeutic foster family\ncare is one such โserviceโ for which DHR deserves praise.  Therapeutic family foster care\ndid not exist as a resource at the inception of this lawsuit, and the court concurs with the\ncourt monitor that โits creation has been a strength of the system.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 Report at 13 (Doc. No. 783)); (see also Implementation Plan โConversionโ section\n31 Defendantโs affidavit is attached to Defendantโs exhibit 5 (titled โCounty\nConversion Scheduleโ) and is electronically docketed by the clerk as exhibit 5 to\ndocument number 761.\n57\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 58 of 148(cid:10)\nat 4 (describing as one of the fifteen indicators of conversion that โthe provision of . . .\ntherapeutic family foster care is increasedโ).) \n  DHRโs success in the area of services can be attributed, in part, to its financial\ncommitment to obtaining and spending the funds necessary for the creation and\nimplementation of these services.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 10 (Doc. No.\n783).)  The evidence reveals that annually DHR is spending $100 million more for child\nwelfare services than required by the Consent Order (i.e., the Order which extended the\ntime for compliance with the Consent Decree).  (Id.); (see Feb. 11, 1999 Consent Order\n(Doc. No. 511)); (Def. Aff. ยถ 16B (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761).)  Also,\nevery county uses flexible funds to provide appropriate services for children and their\nfamilies.  (Lapsley Aff. ยถ 8 (electronically filed as exhibit 6 to Doc. No. 761)); (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 10 (Doc. No. 783) (โThe monitor concurs that flexible\nfunding has been utilized.โ).)  The use of flexible funds is essential to a countyโs ability\nto practice consistently with the Consent Decree.  (See Implementation Plan, cited\nrecently in Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 2-3 (Doc. No. 783)); (see also Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report at 4-5 (observing that โ[s]izable increases in funding through revenue\nmaximization efforts were accomplished and had a direct impact on the availability of\nflexible funds that could be accessed by ISP [individualized service plan] teams to craft\nindividualized services for children and familiesโ).)  \n58\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 59 of 148(cid:10)\nb.  Competent Staff\nParagraph 53 of the Consent Decree states:  โServices shall be provided by\ncompetent staff who are adequately trained and supervised and who have appropriate\ncaseloads.  The competence of staff, staffโs training and supervision, and staffโs caseloads\nshall be deemed adequate when the โsystem of careโ is able to comply with the standards\nset forth in this decree.โ  (Consent Decree ยถ 53.)  In the area of competency of staff, the\ncourt discusses below DHRโs compliance with the courtโs order on licensing standards\nfor social workers, the perception of stakeholders concerning their interactions with staff\nin various counties (as revealed in the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews), and staff\ntraining programs developed as a result of the Consent Decree.\ni.  DHRโs Demonstrated Compliance with the Courtโs Order on Developing\na Licensed Child Welfare Social Worker Workforce\nThe Consent Decreeโs goal of having competent staff is advanced, in part, through\nthe courtโs Order on licensing standards (โLicensing Orderโ), and the evidence reveals\nthat DHR is complying with these court-mandated requirements.  By way of brief\nbackground, in December 1999, DHR finalized a policy on licensing requirements, which\nhas been approved by the court and embodied in the courtโs Licensing Order entered on\nJanuary 18, 2000.  (Licensing Order (Doc. No. 538).)  The policy, in sum and substance,\ncreated a new entry-level classification for social workers and provided that DHR would\n59\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 60 of 148(cid:10)\nonly hire applicants for this classification who had earned a bachelorโs degree in social\nwork.  (Id.)  The policy also implemented incentives for existing staff to obtain\nprofessional social work degrees, such as providing staff with paid educational leave. \n(Id.) \nRegarding the Licensing Order, the court monitor has observed that, โ[t]hrough\ndirect intervention of the court, the workforce has become more professionally\ncredentialed through the preferential hiring of workers having [bachelorโs and masterโs\ndegrees] who subsequently obtain licensure when working for DHR.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 Report at 5 (Doc. No. 783).)  Indeed, the court ordered Defendant to implement\nlicensing requirements for social workers as a measure to help ensure that DHR recruits\nthe caliber of workers needed to implement the Consent Decree.  (Licensing Order (Doc.\nNo. 538).)  \nDefendant has submitted evidence, through the deposition testimony of Reba\nCantrell (โCantrellโ), of DHRโs sustained progress in adhering to and, in some instances,\nexceeding the requirements set out in the courtโs Licensing Order.32  (Cantrell Dep.\nat 38-50 (Attach. K to Doc. No. 779)); (Doc. No. 779 at 20.)  Cantrell attests that DHR\nhires only social workers who meet the court-mandated licensing requirements.33 \n32 At the time she gave her deposition testimony, Cantrell was the program\nadministrator in DHRโs Family Services Division.\n33 Neither Plaintiffs nor the court monitor has contended otherwise.  (See, e.g., Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report (Doc. No. 783) (โThe monitor concurs that . . . a licensing\nprogram as mandated by courtโs order[] [has] been established.โ).)\n60\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 61 of 148(cid:10)\n(Cantrell Dep. at 39.)  Cantrell attests that, consistent with the courtโs Licensing Order,\nDHR continues to reimburse licensing fees for those employees who have attained\nbachelorโs degrees and masterโs degrees in social work and provides supervision and\ncontinuing education for social workers, thereby enabling them to maintain their licensing\nrequirements.  (Id.)  DHRโs other accomplishments in the areas of recruitment and\nretention are set out further in Cantrellโs deposition testimony.  (See id. at 40-50.)  \nMoreover, DHR employs full-time employees whose jobs are devoted to recruiting\nand retaining social workers.  (See id. at 39.)  Namely, in 2001, DHR established a Staff\nDevelopment Office for the specific purpose of ensuring DHRโs compliance with the\ncourtโs Licensing Order and furthering the recruitment and retention of licensed and\nqualified social workers.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1039.  \nThe court monitor has commended DHR for the creation and work of the Staff\nDevelopment Office.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 55).)  Notably, discussing the\naccomplishments of the Staff Development Office, the court monitor has stated, โAs a\nresult of targeting recruiting efforts and supporting workers obtaining licensure, the\npercentage of license-eligible social work frontline staff has increased from 19.3% of\nstaff in 2000 to 40% of staff as of October 2004.โ  (Id.)  As set out by the court monitor\nin his November 2004 Report, DHR also has made a long-term commitment to adhere to\nthe courtโs Licensing Order after termination of the Consent Decree.  (Id.)  In sum, the\ncourt finds that the evidence establishes that DHR is committed to sustaining the\n61\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 62 of 148(cid:10)\nimprovements it has made in recruiting and retaining licensed child welfare social\nworkers and that it is complying with the courtโs Licensing Order.\nii.  Stakeholdersโ Reports\nIn the area of worker competence, another consideration deemed important by the\ncourt monitor, and one which weighs in Defendantโs favor on the substantial compliance\ninquiry, is the perception of relevant stakeholders.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor April 2006\nReport at 4 (requiring for a countyโs conversion that โstakeholder input and collaborative\nworking relationships were predominantly reported as positiveโ)); (see also Larry Dean\nAff. ยถ 8 (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761) (stating that โstakeholder interviews comprise a key\ncomponent of the onsite review processโ).)  Overall, with the exception of Jefferson\nCounty, the court monitor recited positive comments from stakeholders regarding the\ncompetence of staff.  Comments from stakeholders are set out in more detail below, but\nthe court briefly recites a few of those comments here.  In Chambers County, โall\nstakeholders and staff cited strong leadership as the primary strength in the county,โ and,\nin particular, โ[t]he director was described as having a high standard for practice and as\nbeing supportive of her staff.โ  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 12 (Doc. No. 812).)  In\nConecuh County, the court monitor noted that the staff was โstableโ and that โ[t]here was\na high regard for the staff from all stakeholder groups and an overall belief that workers\nare doing a good job and are keeping children safe.โ  (Id. at 28.)  In Jackson County,\n62\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 63 of 148(cid:10)\nstakeholders, in particular, noted โthe strength of the supervisory staff as an asset to\n[DHR] and key to positive practice outcomes.โ  (Id. at 29.)  In Randolph County,\nโ[s]takeholder input was uniformly positive.โ  (Id. at 20.)  Finally, a โstrengthโ of\nMontgomery County, as noted by stakeholders, was the โstableโ leadership.  (Id. at 61.)\niii.  Training\nA multitude of training programs have been implemented as a result of the Consent\nDecree in this case, as elaborated upon in the Child Welfare Strategic Plan which sets out\nvarious training programs which DHR offers for its social workers, many through\nnational resource centers.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1039; (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004\nReport at 55-57); (Ex. to Doc. No. 714.)  Alabama Certification Training is one example\nof the training that now is provided to staff.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 8-9\n(recognizing that โAlabama Certification Training and other training ha[ve] been\nprovided on an ongoing basis to staffโ)); (see also id. at 4 (noting that the development of\nAlabama Certification Training resulted from this litigation).)  The court monitor found,\nand the court concurs, that โtraining curricula . . . have been established.โ  (Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report at 10 (Doc. No. 783).)  \nTurning to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, training specifically was noted\nas a strength in two counties, i.e., Chambers and Jackson.  As to the remaining compliant\ncounties, the court monitor made no observations, positive or negative, on the issue of\n63\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 64 of 148(cid:10)\ntraining; there, however, is no indication that his positive position espoused in his\nNovember 2005 report, supra, has changed.  \nWith that said, the court recognizes that in those counties which the court monitor\ndeemed were not in substantial compliance, workers reported that training needed to be\nimproved.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 6, 29, 44, 69, 79 (Doc. No. 812).) \nCommendably, in one of those counties, namely, Jefferson County, at the time the court\nmonitor conducted his 2006 on-site sustainability review, there was specific evidence that\nthis county already was in the process of improving its training curricula.  (See Tanveer\nAff. ยถ 11 (Ex. to Doc. No. 811).)  โStaff trainers were added to the Jefferson County\nDHR training unit in 2005 to address both new and ongoing training needs,โ and an\nexpanded three-month training program for newly-hired workers was slated to commence\nin August 2005.  (Id.)  \nIn short, the evidence is favorable as to the establishment of exemplar training\nprograms in DHRโs counties.  The evidence, though, is somewhat mixed as to whether\nsome counties are implementing the training curricula in a satisfactory manner.  In\nreaching its findings of systemwide substantial compliance, the court has weighed both\nthe positive and negative evidence in the area of training.\n   \n64\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 65 of 148(cid:10)\n6.  Core Purpose Two:  Appropriate Caseloads\nAs discussed above, compliance with the courtโs Licensing Order is one important\nstep DHR took to implement core purpose two into its child welfare practices.  A more\ndifficult task for DHR has been discerning how to retain an adequate number of\ncompetent staff to serve the children in its care.  One way to retain staff is to minimize\nburnout which can be attributable to high caseloads.  High caseloads also reduce the\nquality of care each child receives from his or her social worker.  To this end, the\nConsent Decree recognizes that child welfare professionals must have appropriate\ncaseloads in order to carry out the principles of the Consent Decree.  (See Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2005 Report at 36 (citing ยถ 53 of the Consent Decree) (Doc. No. 783)); (see also\nAgreement Regarding Implementation, ยง IV, ยถ 12, which provides: โThe Implementation\nPlan shall identify maximum caseloads for various types of staff, including DHR\ncaseworkers, and specify the steps that will be taken to bring caseloads down to at least\nthose levels.โ).)  \nConsequently, the Implementation Plan set a June 1994 deadline for DHR to\ndevelop and to adopt provisional caseload standards, mutually acceptable to the parties,\nfor conversion of counties.  (Doc. Nos. 452, 538.)  The 1994 deadline proved\nunattainable, however, and, ultimately, the court stepped in.  As a result, the parties\nreached an agreement which is embodied in the courtโs order setting caseload and staffing\n65\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 66 of 148(cid:10)\nlevels.34  The courtโs 1998 Order expressly recognizes that โ[t]he Consent Decree\ncontemplates staffing to be one of the core responsibilities of [DHR].โ  (Ct. 1998 Order\nat 2); (Consent Decree ยถ 53.)  This section of the courtโs opinion focuses on DHRโs\ncompliance with the courtโs 1998 Order.\nIn R.C. I, the court explained that the overall objective of the courtโs 1998 Order is\nto restrict the number of cases assigned to social workers so that caseloads remain\nmanageable.35  As recognized by the court monitor, the courtโs 1998 Order also\nโanticipated that there will be some variability in the day-to-day management of caseload\nlevels at the local county level and that some allowance is necessary for periodic, but not\nsustained, county caseload levels going above the court-specified standards.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 38 (Doc. No. 783).)  Therefore, the โImplementationโ\nsections of the courtโs 1998 Order, embodied in Appendix B, ยถ 1, set out the steps a\ncounty must take to correct caseload overages and, at the outer fringe, mandate that DHR\n34 The Order, entered on January 12, 1998, is titled, โOrder on Caseload Standards,\nStaff Allocation and Tracking Compliance.โ  The court refers to this Order in abbreviated\nform as โthe courtโs 1998 Order.โ  The Order also is attached as exhibit 2 to Defendantโs\nโsecond motion for order terminating Consent Decree.โ  (See Doc. No. 761.)     \n35 These standards are set out in an appendix to the courtโs 1998 Order, as well as\non pages 37 and 38 of the court monitorโs November 2005 Report.  (Doc. No. 783.)  For\nexample, the Order provides that there shall be โ1 worker for every 13.5 child abuse and\nneglect reports received on a monthly average the preceding year,โ โ1 worker for every\nopen family services case[],โ โ1 worker for every 18 children in foster care,โ and a\nminimum of one supervisor per county, with โan additional supervisor for each increment\nof six workers.โ  (Ct. 1998 Order, Appendix A.)  There also are additional requirements\nfor large counties, such as Jefferson and Montgomery counties.  (Id.)\n66\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 67 of 148(cid:10)\nimplement corrective action to cure caseload problems within seven months.36  (See id.);\n(see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 40 (Doc. No. 783)); (Salter Aff. ยถ 4\n(electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761).) \nDefendant argues that DHR is complying with the courtโs 1998 Order.37  The\nprimary evidentiary support for his argument comes via two affidavits from Mike Salter\n(โSalterโ), a 32-year veteran of DHR who at the time he signed his affidavits worked as\nthe director of DHRโs office of management and fiscal analysis.  (Salter Affs.\n36 Appendix B to the courtโs 1998 Order, in the section titled โImplementation\nRule,โ provides that โ[t]he average worker-to-case ratio for each component standard will\nnot exceed the standard for three consecutive months without corrective action being\ntaken to bring the average to the standard within 30 days.โ  (Ct. 1998 Order, Appendix\nB); (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 37 (Doc. No. 783).)  Similarly, in the section of\nAppendix B, titled โMonitoring and Correcting Implementation,โ โ[c]ounties that have\nmore than 10% of workers who exceed the standard caseload, or who have a quarterly\naverage that exceeds the standard for a component,โ are required to โfile an exception\nreport identifying the reasons for the assignment of caseloads over standard and the\nactions that will be taken to correct the situation during the next 30 days.โ  (Ct. 1998\nOrder, Appendix B.)  Moreover, where โa county reports in excess of the standard for\ntwo consecutive quarters, the state and county shall analyze the problem to determine\nwhat factors are creating the overload.โ  (Id.)  The Order provides further that\nโ[c]orrective action shall be taken on the analysis within 30 days, including increasing the\ncounty staff allocation, if it is determined that the caseloads in excess of the standard are\na result of increasing incidence and demand.โ  (Id.); (see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report\nat 48 (Doc. No. 783).)\n37 The court emphasizes, at the outset, that it disagrees with Defendantโs statement\nin his affidavit that the court monitor โlack[s]โ an โunderstandingโ of the courtโs 1998\nOrder, and none of the courtโs findings herein should be interpreted as a concurrence with\nDefendantโs latter statement.  (Def. Aff. at 7 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No.\n761)); (see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 48 (Doc. No. 783).)  Indeed, the courtโs\n1998 Order is the product of the court monitorโs recommendations and diligent efforts. \n(See 1998 Order at 4-5.)\n67\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 68 of 148(cid:10)\n(electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761 & Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)38  Briefly,\namong the points Salter makes in his affidavits are as follows.  He says that systemwide\nstaffing allocations actually are greater than that required by the courtโs 1998 Order. \n(Salter Aff. ยถ 11 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761).)  He offers explanations\nfor why variations and overages in caseloads occur.39  Salter also addresses some of the\ncourtโs concerns, which the court outlined in R.C. I, including a concern that staffing\nallocations in certain converted counties were reduced after the counties were โdeclaredโ\nin substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  (Id. ยถ 16.)  Below, the court will\ninclude discussion of Salterโs affidavits where appropriate.  \nIn contrast to DHRโs position, the theme echoed by the court monitor is that DHR\nexhibits weaknesses in its ability to comply with the courtโs 1998 Order.  (See, e.g., Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 89, 93-94 (Doc. No. 812).)  Plaintiffs concur with the court\nmonitorโs opinion and argue that the statistics, collected from the 2006 on-site\n38 Where Defendant has not labeled the exhibits, the court refers to the electronic\nexhibit numbers assigned by the clerk.\n39 Salter says that there are two primary justifications for workload percentages\nexceeding the standards set out in the courtโs 1998 Order.  The first is that in any given\nmonth caseloads may increase, which requires a temporary spike in workloads, but that,\nas stated, the Staffing Committee allocates additional staff when caseloads increase. \n(Salter Aff. at 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)  Second, Salter says\nthat another โreason for an increased workload number is often the result of a staff\nmember leaving DHR,โ but that the procedures in place permit a county to โautomatically\nrequest a register and start the hiring process for a new workerโ when there is a vacancy. \n(Id.)  The court monitor offers additional reasons.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report\nat 46-47 (Doc. No. 783).)\n68\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 69 of 148(cid:10)\nsustainability reviews and as a whole, demonstrate that DHR is not substantially\ncomplying with any component of core purpose two.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 820-18\nat 9-12.)  \na.  Staffing Allocations and the Child Welfare Staffing Committee\nA discussion of staffing allocations is incomplete without first recognizing DHRโs\nChild Welfare Staffing Committee, which is the product of the Consent Decree.  (See Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 40 (Doc. No. 783).)  The Staffing Committee is responsible\nfor allocating for each county the number of staff the county needs in order to comply\nwith the courtโs 1998 Order.  As observed in R.C. I, the Staffing Committee โmeets\nโregularlyโ for the primary purpose of monitoring staff-to-caseload ratios.  The Staffing\nCommittee reviews county directorsโ requests for additional personnel and incorporates\ncounty consultant updates regarding county staffing needs.โ  390 F. Supp.2d at 1039\n(internal citations omitted).  These meetings occur on a monthly basis.  (See Salter Aff.\nยถ 15 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761) (observing that DHRโs โstaffing\ncommittee meets every month to review the caseloads and take corrective action as\nquickly as necessaryโ).)  In his affidavits, Salter describes in more detail the procedures\nused by the Staffing Committee, including the analyses generated by the county caseload\nmanagement reports and the biweekly staffing reports, to review county staffing levels\nand to monitor a countyโs compliance with the courtโs 1998 Order.  (Salter Aff. ยถยถ 5-8\n69\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 70 of 148(cid:10)\n(electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761)); (Salter Aff. at 2-3 (electronically filed as\nEx. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)  The Staffing Committee is an asset of DHR. \nThe court monitor recently observed a specific example of the effective workings\nof the DHR Staffing Committee.  Namely, in Lauderdale County, the court monitor stated\nthat โ[s]taff turnover and caseload issues have been stabilized in the past two yearsโ as a\nresult of the collaborative efforts of the county and the DHR Staffing Committee which\nresulted in the committeeโs allocation of additional personnel for Lauderdale County. \n(Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 37 (Doc. No. 813).)  \nSalter also cites Jackson County as one example of the positive contributions made\nby the Staffing Committee.  He says that, due to the Staffing Committeeโs vigilance in\nmonitoring the increase of child welfare cases in Jackson County, the Staffing Committee\nhas increased staffing allocations five times between November 2003 and September\n2004, from fourteen to eighteen workers. (Salter Aff. ยถ 15 (electronically filed as Ex. 12\nto Doc. No. 761)); (see also Wayne Sellersโ Aff. (Attach. 6 to Doc. No. 811) (stating in\nhis capacity as the director of the Marshall County DHR office that the โDHR Staffing\nCommittee has quickly responded to our ever-increasing caseloads and increased our\nallocation many times over the past two yearsโ).)  Other examples of the work of the\nStaffing Committee are noted in the next section.  \nThe court finds that, through the efforts of the Staffing Committee, DHR actually\nis allocating the number of positions needed in counties to comply with the caseload\n70\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 71 of 148(cid:10)\nstandards established by the courtโs 1998 Order.  The Child Welfare Staff Data charts\nsupport the courtโs findings.  A discussion of that data follows.\nThe court looks first to the Child Welfare Staff Data chart, which is submitted as\nattachment 4 to Salterโs Affidavit.40  (See Doc. No. 779-5).  The Child Welfare Staff Data\nchart contains five categories of information for each county pertaining to staffing and\nworkload data.  As explained by Salter, the first row, titled in abbreviated form โco.\nmthly caseload report,โ reflects the number of staff needed in the county to comply with\nthe courtโs 1998 Order, as calculated by the caseload management system and reported in\nthe county management reports.  The second row, titled โsystem data,โ shows the number\nof staff needed to comply with the courtโs 1998 Order based on DHRโs automated system\n40 Salterโs Affidavit, in turn, is submitted as attachment D to document number\n779.\n71\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 72 of 148(cid:10)\nโcount of cases.โ41  (Salter Aff. at 2, 6 (Doc. No. 779-5).)  The third row, labeled\nโallocation,โ sets forth the staffing allocation determined for the county by the Staffing\nCommittee.  (Id.)  The fourth row, labeled โCFP last pay period of mth.,โ represents the\nnumber of workers actually employed during the month in question, and the fifth and\nfinal row denotes the average R.C. workload percentage in the county for the month. \n(See id.)\n   The Child Welfare Staff Data chart compiles monthly data of seventeen counties\nfrom November 2004 to September 2005.  Of the 187 total months measured, there are\n171 months where staffing allocations in counties either met or exceeded one or both of\nthe figures in the first and second rows (i.e., the figures quantified through the caseload\nmanagement system and DHRโs automated system).  Translated into percentages, this\n41 As explained by Salter, these charts reflect two data collection methods used by\nDHR.  (Salter Aff. ยถ 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761)); (Salter Aff.\nat 2-3 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)  The data reflected in the\ncaseload management reports is input by the county office, and the โsystem count of\ncasesโ is generated by DHRโs automated system.  (Salter Aff. at 2-3 (electronically filed\nas Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)  Salter explains that sometimes there are discrepancies\nbetween the number of cases generated by the caseload management system and DHRโs\nautomated system.  (Id. at 3); (Salter Aff. ยถ 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No.\n761).)  One reason is because the caseload management system does not have the\ncapacity to count prevention cases, which are counted as family services cases in the\nmonthly management report (but correctly classified as prevention cases in DHRโs\nautomated system).  (Id.)  The two reports also may reflect different numbers if the\nnumbers are counted at different points in time during the month.  Salter says that\ngenerally the automated โsystemโ count of cases โtend[s] to be more accurate.โ  (Salter\nAff. at 3 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5).)  No disagreement has been\nadvanced by Plaintiffs or the court monitor concerning Salterโs latter contention.  The\ncourt notes that where there is a variance in the two statistics, in all but a few cases, the\nautomated โsystemโ count of cases reflects the lower number.\n72\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 73 of 148(cid:10)\ndata reflects that DHR met the staffing allocation requirements in 91 percent of the\nmonths examined.  The court finds that this data is favorable.    \nThe sixteen remaining months (out of 187 months) denote staff allocation\nshortages in five counties, namely, Elmore, Jackson, Marshall, Pike and Shelby.  Jackson\nCountyโs staff allocation was short by one for five months, and Marshall Countyโs staff\nallocation suffered by one for seven consecutive months.  Elmore County also was short\none allocation during one month, as was Pike County.  Shelby County was deficient by\none worker for two months.  \nSimilarly, the court finds that favorable results are revealed in a separate Child\nWelfare Staff Data chart, submitted as Appendix D to the court monitorโs April 2006\nReport.  This chart examines staffing data on twenty-seven counties for a period of\nthirteen months beginning in December 2004 and continuing through December 2005.42 \nAs reflected in this chart, for 321 months (out of a total of 351 months), staffing\nallocations either met or exceeded one or both of the figures quantified by the caseload\nmanagement system and DHRโs automated system (which are used to determine\ncompliance with the courtโs 1998 Order). \n42 Some of the counties set out in Salterโs exhibit, discussed above, and Appendix\nD are the same, and, for those intersecting counties, the charts overlap for the months of\nDecember 2004 through September 2005.  Appendix D, however, contains data for the\nadditional months of October 2005, November 2005, and December 2005. \n73\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 74 of 148(cid:10)\nThe data and percentages discussed herein are even more positive when one\nconsiders that the staffing allocations, which are generated by the caseload management\nsystem (designated as โco. reportโ on the Total Child Welfare Staff Need report) and\nDHRโs automated system (designated as โsystemโ on the Total Child Welfare Staff Need\nreport), are based upon the caseload ratios which DHR has implemented which, for some\ntypes of cases are lower than that required by the courtโs 1998 Order.  (See Attach. 3\nto Salter Aff. (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5)); (see also Salter Aff. at 4\n(electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5)); (Salter Aff. ยถ 8 (electronically filed as\nEx. 12 to Doc. No. 761).)  For instance, Salter attests, that as of September 2005,\nsystemwide, there were thirty-one additional CAN (child abuse and neglect) social\nworkers allocated to various county offices due to DHRโs implementation of a ratio lower\nthan the courtโs standard.  (Salter Aff. at 5 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No.\n779-5).)   \nSalter further attests that DHR โhas consistently provided more staff for county\noffices than required by the staffing order,โ and he has discussed the statistics which the\ncourt finds supports his assertion.  (See, e.g., Salter Aff. ยถ 12 (electronically filed as Ex.\n12 to Doc. No. 761).)  For example, he says that, in May 2005, โ[t]he combined total of\nthe workers on board and the ones being hired was 1,609, which [was] the staffing\nallocation for May 2005.โ  (Id. ยถ 10.) \n74\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 75 of 148(cid:10)\nBased on the foregoing evidence, the court issues the following findings.  First,\noverall, having considered in its totality the evidence assimilated in the Child Welfare\nStaff Data charts, the court finds that the data equates to evidence of substantially\ncompliant staffing allocations.  Similarly, the court concurs with Salter that these charts\nโshow[] that DHR is working hard to keep staff levels high enough to enable [] counties\nto meet the caseload standards.โ  (Salter Aff. at 6 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc.\nNo. 779-5).)  Furthermore, the court finds that the shortfalls are minimal and are\ninconsequential to a finding of substantial compliance.  Second, the court finds that the\nStaffing Committee ensures, through monitoring and analysis, that counties are allocated\na sufficient number of workers to comply with and, in some instances, to exceed the\nrequirements in the courtโs 1998 Order.  (See id.)\nAdditionally, Salter adequately has addressed the courtโs concern, as also voiced\nby the court monitor, that DHR reduced staffing allocations in counties after the counties\nwere found to be in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  See R.C. I, 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1051; (see Salter Aff. ยถ 16 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761).) \nSalter attests, โWhile it is true that some counties were reduced in staff after conversion,\nthey were never reduced below the number required by the caseload standards.โ  (see\nSalter Aff. ยถ 16.)  He explains that, during the conversion process, many counties were\nprovided extra staff โabove that needed by the court[-]ordered standards, so that workers\nwould have time to learn the R.C. principles.โ  (Id.)  He cites Calhoun County as an\n75\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 76 of 148(cid:10)\nexample.  He says that in December 2003, when Calhoun County had its assertion\npresentation, Calhoun County employed eleven more workers than required by the\ncourtโs 1998 Order (i.e., the courtโs 1998 Order required fifty-six workers and Calhoun\nCounty employed sixty-seven workers).  (Id.)  By April 2005, due to a decrease in the\nnumber of cases, the courtโs 1998 Order required Calhoun County to employ fifty-four\nworkers.  (Id.)  The court, thus, finds that Calhoun Countyโs reduction of staff between\nDecember 2003 and April 2005 from sixty-seven to sixty did not violate the courtโs 1998\nOrder.  (Id.)  Salter also states that โ[s]omeโ counties have increased their staff since the\ntime of assertion presentations and cites Etowah County as one example.  (Id. ยถ 17.) \nAt this juncture, the court observes that, although Salter suggests to the contrary,\nthe court does not view the court monitor to dispute the foregoing evidence.  Indeed, the\ncourt monitor has noted a positive trend in recent staffing patterns.  The court monitor has\nstated that, subsequent to his November 2004 Report, statewide, โboth the actual number\nof child welfare professionals and the number of allocated positions have increased.โ \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 at 39 (Doc. No. 783).)  Namely, the court monitor stated that, in\nAugust 2004, there were 1,558 allocated positions and, in October 2005, that number\nincreased to 1,622.  (Id.)  Corresponding to the increased allocations, in August 2004,\nthere were 1,546 actual workers, and in October 2005, there were 1,564 actual workers. \n(Id.)  Allocating a sufficient number of staffing slots to each county to comply with the\ncourtโs 1998 Order and actual filling all of those available slots are two different issues. \n76\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 77 of 148(cid:10)\nThe court monitor primarily criticizes the latter, as discussed below; Salter focuses on the\nformer.   \nb.   DHRโs Compliance with the Monitoring\nand Reporting Sections of the Courtโs 1998 Order\nThe court finds that the evidence demonstrates that DHR is monitoring caseloads\nstandards, in accordance with the dictates set out in Section II of the courtโs 1998 Order. \n(See Ct. 1998 Order, Appendix B, ยง II.)  Based on the foregoing evidence, the court finds\nthat DHR has in place a well-functioning framework for allocating staff and tracking and\nreporting caseloads, by number and by type, on the county level, as required by Section\nII.  (See id. (โEach county shall determine monthly the average caseload for each standard\ncomponent (i.e., foster cases, family services, etc.) and document the average caseload\nduring the months for each worker[].โ).  The court monitor concurs that โinformation is\ncollected that can be used to manage and evaluate the system of care.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 Report at 10 (Doc. No. 783).)  The effectiveness of DHRโs framework is\ndemonstrated by the Staffing Committeeโs proven ability to allocate staff for each county,\nadjusting the numbers up or down when necessary, so that each county has the number of\nstaff required to comply with the courtโs 1998 Order.  In other words, the court finds that\nDHR is โincreasing the county staff allocation, if it is determined that the caseloads in\n77\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 78 of 148(cid:10)\nexcess of the standard are a result of increasing incidence and demand.โ  (Ct. 1998 Order,\nAppendix B, ยง II E.)  \nFurthermore, the evidence establishes that, as dictated by the courtโs 1998 Order,\ncounties are โreport[ing] three months of caseload data by worker and a quarterly average\non the quality assurance reports.โ  (See id. ยง II B.)  Finally, the courtโs 1998 Order\nrequires that a county having more than 10 percent of workers exceeding the standard\ncaseloads must file an exception report, explaining therein the reasons for the overages\nand the corrective action which it is implementing to correct the deficiencies.  As\nrecognized by the court monitor, โDHR has consistently filed these exception reports as\naddendums to the monthly caseload management report.โ43  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005\nReport at 43 (Doc. No. 783).) \n43 The court monitor provides an excerpt of an exception report on page 44 of his\nNovember 2005 Report, which explains that for the month in question variances occurred\nfor various reasons, including one workerโs military deployment, the hiring of two new\nemployees, several workersโ involvement in required training, two workersโ absence due\nto maternity and medical leaves, and the transfer of another worker.  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 Report at 44 (Doc. No. 783)); (Def. Aff. ยถ 16B (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc.\nNo. 761).)  These exception reports are discussed further below. \n78\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 79 of 148(cid:10)\nc.  The Court Monitorโs Measurements for Ascertaining Substantial Compliance\nwith the Courtโs 1998 Order and Examination of the\nEvidence from the 2006 On-Site Sustainability Reviews\nThe court monitor traditionally has taken into account three factors when\nanalyzing caseload data to assess compliance with the courtโs 1998 Order.  (See Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783).)  These three โimportantโ factors,\nexplained in more detail below, are as follows:  (1) the countyโs โaverage R.C.\nworkloadโ; (2) the number of counties which are โover standardsโ for periods of time\nexceeding the seven-month outer goal of corrective action set out in the courtโs 1998\nOrder, see supra footnote 36; and (3) the percentage of workers โover standardsโ within a\ncounty.44  (See id. at 47-48.)  As to the third factor, the court monitor has stated:  โHaving\n20% or less of [the] staff over court-specified standards falls within the range of caseload\nvariability typically accepted by the monitor.โ  (Ct. Monitor Dec. 2003 Report at 29.) \nConcerning the first factor, at times, the court monitor also has given some leeway (10\npercent) to counties concerning overages in R.C. workloads.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 at 48 (Doc. No. 783)); (cf. Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 37 (Doc. No. 812)\n(observing that a case worker whose monthly caseload average was 109 percent was over\nstandards โby a small percentageโ).)  \n44 โOver standards,โ as that term is used by the court monitor, means that the\nworker had a caseload average for the month in question exceeding the workload deemed\nacceptable under the courtโs 1998 Order.  For consistency, the court uses the same\nphraseology.\n79\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 80 of 148(cid:10)\nThe court further finds that other factors also are relevant to the analysis of\ncompliant caseloads.  Some of these factors were discussed in the preceding subsections\nand include whether DHR is allocating positions to allow counties to hire the requisite\nnumber of workers needed to comply with the courtโs 1998 Order and whether DHR is\ncomplying with other of the technical requirements of the courtโs 1998 Order, such as the\nimplementation of measures to monitor and to track caseload data (i.e., Section II of\nAppendix B).  As discussed above, the court finds that DHR is compliant in the foregoing\nmatters.  Any evidence of good faith on the part of DHR also should not be ignored and\nhas been considered by the court.\nBelow, the court examines the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews to assess how\nthe ten representative counties are performing in the three areas traditionally examined by\nthe court monitor (as set out above).  As explained herein, the court finds that the 2006\non-site sustainability reviews yield results which support a finding of systemwide\nsubstantial compliance concerning core purpose two.  The court further finds that the\nevidence reveals a demonstration of good faith by DHR and establishes that federal\noversight is not necessary in order to ensure future compliance with the courtโs 1998\nOrder.\n80\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 81 of 148(cid:10)\ni. Countiesโ Average R.C. Workloads\nIn his December 2003 Report, the court monitor stated that a countyโs average\nR.C. workload level is an โindicator that describes the ability of the staffing capacity of\neach individual county to meet the courtโs current caseload demands.โ  (Ct. Monitor Dec.\n2003 Report at 11.)  He explains that a countyโs average R.C. workload level โis\ndetermined by a formula that examines the total number of children and families\nreceiving services (CAN investigations, Foster Care and/or Protective Services,\nAdoptions, Resource Development and Supervisors) and compar[es] these figures to\nallocated staff for each of the above-listed service-type categories.โ  (Id.)  According to\nthe caseload management reports, attached as Appendix C to the court monitorโs April\n2006 Report, eight of the ten counties did not exceed an average R.C. workload of 100\npercent for the month reviewed.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report, Appendix C.) \nThose counties and their average R.C. workloads, in percentages, are as follows: \n(1) Chambers (74 percent); (2) Randolph (67 percent); (3) Conecuh, (89 percent);\n(4) Jackson, (98 percent); (5) Lauderdale (84 percent); (6) Lee (82 percent);\n(7) Montgomery (97 percent); and (8) Jefferson (93 percent).  (See id.)  Another county,\nMarshall County, had an average R.C. workload of 107 percent, meaning that only one\ncounty, Macon County, scored above 110 percent, with an average R.C. workload of 114\npercent.  (See id.)  The court finds that the foregoing data is very favorable.\n81\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 82 of 148(cid:10)\nThe foregoing evidence collected as part of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews\nalso reveals other positive facts on caseload standards.  The court finds that the data set\nout in the Child Welfare Staff Data chart, attached as Appendix D to the court monitorโs\nApril 2006 Report, and the data in Appendix C reflect the ability of counties to correct\ncaseload overages.  For example, between December 2004 and December 2005, Jackson\nCounty experienced average R.C. workloads ranging between 101 percent and 126\npercent; however, Jackson County attained an improved 98 percent average R.C.\nworkload in February 2006 during the court monitorโs on-site sustainability review.  (See\nCt. Monitor April 2006 Report at 30 & Appendixes C & D.)  Conecuh County also\ndemonstrated improvements, reducing average R.C. workloads for four consecutive\nmonths, from 139 percent in September 2005, to 119 percent in October 2005, to 92\npercent in November 2005 and, finally, to 89 percent in December 2005.  (Id.,\nAppendixes C & D.)  Additionally, for five consecutive months, from September 2005 to\nJanuary 2006, Montgomery County maintained its average R.C. workloads in the\nninetieth percentile range.  (Id.)  \nAppendix D also reflects that the average R.C. workloads in Lee and Randolph\ncounties remained below 100 percent for thirteen consecutive months; thus, these two\ncounties exhibited perfect compliance for the time period in question.  Jefferson and\nLauderdale counties maintained average R.C. workloads at or below 105 percent during\nthe same thirteen months.  (See id., Appendix D.) \n82\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 83 of 148(cid:10)\nii.  Countiesโ Seven-Month Track Record\nIn his November 2005 Report to the court, the court monitor stated:\nManaging active caseloads on a day-to-day basis is a dynamic process as\ncaseload levels for individual workers will fluctuate as cases close, and new\ncases for children and families are opened.  It is not uncommon in the\nmanagement of active cases for workers to occasionally go above caseload\nstandards.  This occasional allowance was contemplated in the timeframes\nfor corrective action discussed in the 1998 Order[.]\n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783).)  The courtโs 1998 Order\nrecognizes the inevitable ebb and flow in caseloads for individual workers and, thus,\npermits DHR a period of time to correct noncompliant caseloads, with seven months\nconstituting the maximum time period for correction, see supra footnote 36.  (See also Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 48 (Doc. No. 783).)  For the reasons to follow, the court\nfinds that the ten representative counties, which were subjected to the 2006 on-site\nsustainability reviews, demonstrate that DHR is tracking caseloads, identifying caseload\nproblems, and implementing corrective action to correct caseload overages within the\ncourt-ordered maximum time frames.  \nIn his April 2006 Report, the court monitor did not elaborate upon certain data\nwhich the court finds demonstrates that counties effectively are ensuring that average\nR.C. workloads do not exceed the 100 percent ceiling for seven continuous months. \nAppendix D to the court monitorโs April 2006 Report charts the monthly average\nworkload levels of the ten representative counties and others from December 2004\n83\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 84 of 148(cid:10)\nthrough December 2005 and is worthy of the courtโs discussion.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006\nReport, Appendix D (Doc. No. 812).)  As outlined in Appendix D, eight of the ten\ncounties subjected to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews (which includes two non-\nsustaining counties) were not over standards for any uninterrupted seven-month period. \n(See id.)  Of these ten counties, therefore, only Jackson and Marshall counties suffered\naverage R.C. workload levels greater than 100 percent for seven consecutive months.45 \nRegarding Jackson County, however, the data is not all bad.  The data reveals that\nJackson County gradually made improvements; namely, between October 2005 and\nDecember 2005, Jackson County reduced its average R.C. workload from 122 percent to\n101 percent.  Moreover, neither Jackson County nor Marshall County had average R.C.\nworkload levels greater than 110 percent for any continuous seven-month period, 110\npercent being a margin of tolerance recognized recently by the court monitor.  (See Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 at 48 (Doc. No. 783)); (cf. Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 37\n(observing that a case worker whose monthly caseload average was 109 percent was over\nstandards โby a small percentageโ).)    \nPrior to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, the court monitor stated โthat\ncounties having [average] R.C. workloads over standards, with some counties having\nworkloads over standards for durations as long as seven months, remains a persistent\nproblem for DHR.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783).)  The court\n45 Again, the court notes that a worker with an average R.C. workload of 100\npercent or less is deemed in compliance with the courtโs 1998 Order. \n84\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 85 of 148(cid:10)\nfinds that the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews of the ten representative counties reveal\nthat DHR has halted and, indeed, has corrected this โpersistent problem.โ  The court finds\nthat this data reveals marked improvements and that the data easily extends into the\nparameters of substantial compliance.\niii.  Data Pertaining to Percentages of Staff โOver Standardsโ\nThe court turns to an examination of the data from the 2006 on-site sustainability\nreviews to ascertain how many workers were โover standardsโ within a county, the third\nfactor which the court monitor deemed important when analyzing caseload data to assess\na countyโs compliance with the courtโs 1998 Order.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47\n(Doc. No. 783).)  This factor denotes โthe percentage of staff for each county [who] have\ncurrent caseloads that are in excess of court-specified limits, commonly referred to as\nbeing โover standards.โโ  (Ct. Monitor Dec. 2003 Report at 10.)  Again, a worker with an\naverage R.C. workload of 100 percent or less is deemed in compliance with the courtโs\n1998 Order.  Below is the data, discussed county by county, concerning workers who, for\nthe month in question, carried caseloads in violation of the standards set out in the courtโs\n1998 Order, as reported in the monthly management reports generated by DHRโs\ncaseload management system.  This data is found in Appendix C to the court monitorโs\nApril 2006 Report.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report, Appendix C (Doc. No. 812).) \n85\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 86 of 148(cid:10)\nThe court observes also that the court monitorโs discussions, presently and in the\npast, reveal that other considerations, in addition to the raw data, also factored into the\ncourt monitorโs evaluation of whether a county is performing satisfactorily in this third\narea of examination.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 53-54 (Doc. No. 783).) \nThe court, thus, includes discussion of these other relevant considerations, which include\namong other things the perceptions of stakeholders.  Below, the court first sets out the\nevidence garnered from each county as a result of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews,\nfollowed by the courtโs findings regarding said evidence. \nIn Chambers County, one of the six workers, or 17 percent, was over standards.46 \nThis workerโs workload for the month was 108.6 percent.  The intake worker was over\nstandards (155.6 percent), and one of the three supervisors, or 33 percent, was over\nstandards (111 percent).47  As the court monitor explained, in Chambers County, there\nwas significant turnover in front-line practice, but he found that the turnover was\nโwarrantedโ and did not โreflect[] adversely in current practice.โ  (Ct. Monitor April 2006\n46 The court notes that the court monitor cautions that sometimes the percentages\ncan be somewhat misleading in that โsome counties have a small number of workers due\nto the size of the county.  Thus, a large percentage of staff having caseloads over\nstandards may be reflective of a small number of workers being over standards.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 46 (Doc. No. 783).)\n47 Again, โover standardsโ is the terminology used by the court monitor.  The case\nmanagement reports also employ the phraseology โover compliance.โ  โOver complianceโ\nmeans the same thing as โover standardsโ; both usages denote non-compliance.\n86\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 87 of 148(cid:10)\nReport at 6-7 (Doc. No. 812).)  The court monitor says also that the caseloads of the\nintake and caseworker will even out as new workers assume caseloads.  (Id.)  \nIn Randolph County, no worker was โover standards,โ meaning that eight case\nworkers, the intake worker and three supervisors had workload averages for the month in\nquestion at or below 100 percent.  Accordingly, the court monitor reports that the staff in\nRandolph County has been very stable with no turnover in the twelve months preceding\nhis report.  (Id. at 14.)\nIn Conecuh County, โ25% of workers [were] over standard[s].โ  (Id. at 21.)  The\ncourt monitor, however, indicates that this percentage, although seemingly high, โshould\nbe interpreted with some caution.โ  (Id.)  He observes that โ[t]here [was] one CAN\ninvestigator . . . who also ha[d] 11 ongoing cases and one foster care child.โ  (Id.)  This\nworker was โover standardsโ by a small percentage (102.4 percent).  See id.  The court\nmonitor also states that there were โtwo foster care workers[,] with [one] worker at 114%\nof workload standard, [who was] shown as having 15 foster care cases, three ongoing,\nand one CAN.โ  (Id.)  The court observes also that the sole supervisor was in compliance\nwith the workload figures.  (See id., Appendix C.)  \nConecuh County, however, experienced no staff turnover in the twelve months\npreceding the court monitorโs April 2006 Report.  (See id. at 21.)  The court monitor\nrecites that stakeholders felt that โworkers are dedicated and are providing equal or better\nservice than at the time of assertion.โ  (Id. at 28.)  The 2006 on-site sustainability review\n87\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 88 of 148(cid:10)\nsimilarly revealed that โ[t]here was a high regard for the staff from all stakeholder groups\nand an overall belief that workers are doing a good job and are keeping children safe.โ \n(Id.)\nIn Jackson County, the monthly management report reveals that 43 percent of the\nworkers had caseloads which exceeded the maximum caseload requirements, with\ncaseloads ranging from 111.1 percent to 153.3 percent.  (Id., Appendix C.)  One of the\nthree supervisors also exceeded standards, carrying a workload which was 5.6 percent\nโover standards.โ  (Id.)  Pertaining to Jackson County, the court monitor observes that, at\nthe time of his report, the Jackson County director had been in the position for only nine\nmonths.  (Id. at 29.)  He also says that, โ[a]lthough the new staff is young and\ninexperienced in the child welfare field,โ these new professionals have โstrong social\nwork skillsโ and โstrong training and support from supervisory staff.โ  (Id.)  The three\nsupervisors โhave longevity,โ and stakeholders, in particular, โrepeatedly noted the\nstrength of the supervisory staff as an asset to the department.โ  (Id.)  Noting the statistics\nfrom the monthly management report under review, however, the court monitor states that\nโ[s]taffing continues to be a major challenge for Jackson DHR.โ  (Id. at 30); (see also id.\nat 36.)  Also, during the twelve months preceding the court monitorโs April 2006 Report,\nturnover was high:  โJackson County has experienced 68.2% turnover in the senior social\nworker position and 54.1% in the social worker position.โ  (Id.)  Nonetheless,\n88\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 89 of 148(cid:10)\nstakeholders โconsistently described good working relations between the department staff\nand community partners.โ  (Id.)\nIn Lauderdale County, only three workers out of twenty-one were over standards\n(or 14 percent).  The three with overages were case workers, with one exceeding\nstandards by a mere .6 percent (100.6%).  (See id., Appendix C.)  The other two case\nworkers had average workloads for the month of 109 percent and 125 percent.  (Id.); (see\nalso id. at 37 (observing that two of three case workers were over caseload standards โby\na small percentageโ).)  The court monitor reports that staffing in this county has been\nโvery stableโ since fiscal year 2004.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 37 (Doc. No.\n812).)  Although Lauderdale County experienced high staff turnover and some\ncaseworkers were over standards, โstaff turnover and caseload issues have been\nstabilizedโ as a result of the collaborative efforts of the county and the DHR Staffing\nCommittee which resulted in the committeeโs allocation of additional personnel for\nLauderdale County.  (Id.)  Management and case workers have positive relationships,\nwith case workers reporting that they feel well supported by their superiors through\nโfrequent supervision sessions,โ โmentoring,โ and โshadowing of staff to court hearings,\nhome visits, etc.โ  (Id.)\nIn Lee County, the monthly management report reveals that, as in Lauderdale\nCounty, 14 percent of the workers were over standards.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report,\nAppendix C (Doc. No. 812).)  Three of the twenty-one โcase-carrying positionsโ were\n89\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 90 of 148(cid:10)\nover standards.  (Id. at 45.)  These three workers had average caseloads of 111.1 percent,\n112.5 percent and 133.3 percent.  No supervisor was โover standards.โ  (Id.) \nNotwithstanding these positive figures, the court monitor observed that staff turnover\nrates have been high and that โ[a]ll stakeholder groups identified worker burnout and staff\nretention as areas of concern.โ  (Id. at 53, 54.)  On the other hand, the court monitor\nstated that, prior to the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, DHR was aware of the\nproblems in Lee County and that DHR already was โtaking stepsโ to correct the\nproblems.  (Id. at 54.)  Additionally, stakeholders found that staff within Lee County\nDHR was โaccessible,โ and stakeholders โexpressed a high regard for leadership and\nstaff.โ  (Id.)  In the latter regard, the court monitor stated, โA major strength in Lee\nCounty has been the DHR Director and the management staff.โ  (Id.) \nIn Montgomery County, 35 percent of the workers exceeded caseload standards, as\nreported in the monthly management report.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 report, Appendix D\n(Doc. No. 812).)  Twenty-four case workers exceeded the standard caseload\nrequirements, with monthly workload percentages ranging from 100.7 percent to 212.5\npercent.  (Id.)  Four supervisors were carrying caseloads in excess of standards, with\nworkload percentages for the month ranging from 110 percent to 211.1 percent.  (Id.) \nThe court monitor reported high turnover rates in this county.  In the twelve months\npreceding his report, the court monitor says that โ65% of senior social workers, 40% of\nsocial service caseworkers, and 34% of social workers have separated from service.โ  (Ct.\n90\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 91 of 148(cid:10)\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 54.)  The court monitor observes that, although Appendix\nD โdoes not show that staffing is a problem in Montgomery County,โ he says that โthe\nturnover of staff and the resulting high caseloads are a major problem to sustaining\nperformance.โ  (Id.)  \nIn Montgomery County, stakeholders also have โexpressed concern regarding\ncaseworker burnout and caseload size and felt these issues contributed to staff turnover.โ \n(Id. at 61.)  On the other hand, stakeholders reported โstrong, collaborative relationships\nwith Montgomery County DHR,โ โperceive[d] that the department is working diligently\nto provide good quality services despite staff turnover and challenges,โ and cited\nโexcellent examples of good work.โ  (Id.)  The court monitor also observed that a\nโstrength of Montgomery County DHR is that the leadership and management team have\nbeen very stable over the past ten yearsโ and that this managerial team โunderstand[s] the\ncritical role that quality practice has on achieving successful outcomes for children and\nfamilies.โ  (Id.)  At the same time, โ[t]he major challenge is achieving a stable caseload-\ncarrying staff and creating an environment that will support retention and training of\nworkers.โ  (Id.)  \nThe court observes that the evidence demonstrates that DHR is aware of the high\nturnover rates in Montgomery County.  It already has taken a concrete step aimed to\ncorrect the problem.  Namely, DHR has requested and received approval to increase the\nin-hire rates for social workers, senior social workers and social service caseworkers in\n91\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 92 of 148(cid:10)\nMontgomery County and other large counties.  (See id., Appendix H (State Personnel\nDepartmentโs letter approving Defendantโs request to increase in-hire rates for counties\nwith high turnover rates, including Montgomery County).) \nTurning to Macon County, the caseload management report provides that there are\nfive caseload-carrying positions, that 1.4 workers out of five exceeded caseload\nstandards, and that the sole supervisor was over standards.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006\nReport, Appendix C (Doc. No. 812).)  The court monitor observes that staff turnover is\nhigh in Macon County, peaking at 82 percent overall in 2004, and that stakeholders\nidentified โstaffingโ as one of the โbiggest challenges for this county.โ  (See id. at 62, 69.) \nThe court monitor states, though, that, prior to his 2006 on-site sustainability review,\nDHR had identified performance issues in Macon County and had begun โtaking steps to\naddress them.โ  (Id. at 62); (see also Slaughter Aff. at 1-3 (Ex. 7 to Doc. No. 811)\n(discussing corrective action taken in Macon County, including drastic changes in\nmanagement).)48\nMarshall County, a non-sustaining county, exhibited substantial problems in the\narea of excessive caseload ratios during the 2006 on-site sustainability review.  (See, e.g.,\nCt. Monitor April 2006 Report at 79 (Doc. No. 812) (finding that Marshall County is not\nsustaining substantial performance, โparticularly regarding the core purpose[] of adequate\n48 James Slaughter (โSlaughterโ) signed his affidavit in his capacity as deputy\ncommissioner of DHRโs field administration.\n92\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 93 of 148(cid:10)\nand competent staffโ).)  Twenty-five of thirty-seven workers were over standards, and\nthree, or 30 percent, of the supervisors were over standards.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006\nReport, Appendix C.)  The court monitor observed that Marshall County had a QSR\nreview in 2001 and that specific areas needing improvements included โstaffing and\ncaseloads,โ as there was not an adequate number of staff to meet caseload standards.  (Id.\nat 70.)  Stakeholders, however, โwere generally positive about Marshall Countyโs\nefforts,โ but they โrecognized the problems with high caseloads and staff youth and\nturnover.โ  (Id. at 78.) \nTurning finally to Jefferson County, the court monitor observed that โ[t]he\nturnover rates and the caseloads are [] significant impediment[s] to the county sustaining\nappropriate performance.โ  (Id. at 80.)  The statistics, cited by the court monitor, support\nhis conclusion.  (Id.)  Thirty-one percent of the workers allocated to the child welfare\nprogram were over standards, with 88.5 of 211 workers (or 42 percent) being over\nstandards.  (See id. at 80 & Appendix C.)  Only one supervisor of the forty-nine\nsupervisors/administrators (or 2 percent), however, was over standards, as revealed on the\nmonthly management report.  (See id., Appendix C.)  Given this data, Jefferson County,\nas the largest urban county in Alabama, also should benefit from the increased in-hire\nrates as a result of DHRโs targeted efforts to help combat the high turnover rates in this\ncounty.  (See id., Appendix H.)  \n93\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 94 of 148(cid:10)\nAs demonstrated from above, the court carefully has studied the caseload and\nstaffing data contained in the court monitorโs April 2006 Report.  The court is aware of\nboth the positive and negative statistics, as outlined above.  After the courtโs careful\nstudy, the court renders the following findings.  \nFindings Regarding Exception Reports\nThe court has studied the comments attached to each county report, called\nโexception reports.โ   These exception reports provide explanations for the assignment of\ncaseloads to a worker who is over standards and explain the corrective action that the\ncounty plans to implement to bring the caseworkerโs caseload into compliance with the\ncourtโs 1998 Order.  These exception reports reveal that the data, as recognized by the\ncourt monitor, cannot be viewed based upon percentages alone.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor\nApril 2006 Report at 21 (observing that in Conecuh County although the caseload\nmanagement report reveals that 25 percent of workers were over court-ordered standards,\nthat data โshould be interpreted with some caution,โ given other available information\nwhich deflects the seeming severity of the percentages).)  A predominating concern from\nDHRโs perspective, which the court finds is illuminated in these exception reports, is the\ndelicate balancing of the competing interests pertaining to DHRโs compliance with the\ncaseload standards imposed by the courtโs 1998 Order and the reassignment of a case\nwhere a child has formed a meaningful relationship with a caseworker.  In his affidavit,\n94\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 95 of 148(cid:10)\nSalter states, โThe only way a county director could insure that workers never exceeded\nthe standards would be to constantly move the cases from worker to worker every month,\nso that the caseloads were always equal.โ  (Salter Aff. ยถ 13 (electronically filed as Ex. 12\nto Doc. No. 761).)  Salter says, however, that โgood outcomes for children would not be\nachieved by assigning them a new worker every few months just to meet a caseload\nstandard.โ  (Id.)  The court concurs generally with Salterโs statements.  \nIn the exception report for Jackson County, for example, five caseworkers who\noversee foster care children were over standards; however, the management team\nweighed the competing interests and decided not to โseverโ these workersโ relationships\nfor the expedience of improving the workload percentage statistics.  For each worker, it\nwas noted that several children were โreaching permanencyโ and that each case worker\nwould be within standards within six weeks.  Similar decisions were noted and suggested\nin Conecuh, Macon and Lauderdale counties.  In Lauderdale County, for example, the\nprogram supervisor expressly made the following observation:\nHaving specialized units rather than generic caseloads prohibits cases from\nbeing assigned equally across lines and can give the appearance of work\nbeing unevenly distributed.  Caseloads are assessed monthly and a\ndetermination is made as to reassignments (as a foster care worker going to\nAssessment Unit mid November).  We also take into account the need for\ncontinuity for our families and assess the impact change has on them.  The\nsupervisor also looks at the level of intensity needed in the case while\nmaking assignments.  A workerโs numbers may be lower than [anotherโs]\n. . ., but the time needed in the cases is as great.\n(Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report, Appendix C, Lauderdale County.)\n95\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 96 of 148(cid:10)\nIn the circumstances identified in the record, the court is satisfied that preservation\nof established bonds between caseworkers and children overrides strict compliance with\nthe courtโs 1998 Order.  In other words, the court is loathe to find that DHR is not\nadhering to court-ordered caseload standards where the alleged infractions are the result\nof considered deliberations by DHR that continuity of care, rather than technical\ncompliance with caseload statistics, promotes the best interest of the child.  In these\ncases, the court finds that compliant percentages can and should be sacrificed and that the\ngoals of the Consent Decree are fulfilled, rather than violated.\nThe exception reports reveal the many challenges facing counties in maintaining\ncompliant caseloads for workers.  Workers are called to active military duty.  Workers\ntake maternity leave or are absent due to other medical reasons.49  Workers quit, resign\nand retire mid-month.  Newly-hired workers have reduced caseloads because a portion of\ntheir work day is spent in training.  From month to month, incoming cases fluctuate and\nthe types of cases vary.  Overall, the court is satisfied with the explanations in the\nexception reports for the overages.  \nIn the courtโs considered opinion, DHR does everything possible to remedy these\nshortcomings.  Through the Staffing Committee, DHR monitors these ever-changing\ncomplexities on a biweekly basis.  Based on the evidence discussed previously in this\n49 (See also Def. Aff. at 6 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761) (DHR has\nโa young and fertile workforce in which a significant percentage of workers take\nmaternity leave[] each year.โ).) \n96\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 97 of 148(cid:10)\nopinion, the court finds that the Staffing Committee effectively rectifies worker shortages\nby increasing a countyโs allocation when caseloads increase.  Similarly, the court finds\nthat the evidence establishes that DHR has in place procedures which permit a county,\nwithout delays, to request a register and commence the hiring process when there is a\nvacancy.  (See, e.g., Salter Aff. at 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5));\n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783) (recognizing DHRโs โgood faith\nefforts . . . to attempt to keep counties within caseload standards by providing registers to\nfill vacant positions in a timely manner and allocating additional positions when ongoing\nworkload/caseload demands merit an increase in a countyโs allocationโ).)\nFindings Regarding Staff Turnover\nAs revealed above, high turnover rates among staff are a challenge which DHR\nfaces on a daily basis.  The court, however, finds that DHR has not turned a blind eye to\nthis obstacle.  Defendantโs attestations reveal DHRโs cognizance.  Defendant states, โThe\nreality of child welfare work in Alabama and everywhere in this country is that the\nworkforce is marked by high turnover levels.โ  (Def. Aff. at 6 (electronically filed as Ex.\n5 to Doc. No. 761).)  The high turnover rates cannot totally be blamed on internal failings\nwithin DHR.  As observed by Defendant, high turnover is caused, in part, by the fact that\nโworking with troubled families is often difficult and debilitating, especially where the\n97\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 98 of 148(cid:10)\nfamilies have been ravaged by poverty, drugs and the absence of one or both parents.โ \n(Id.)  The court finds this reason to be valid.  \nThe evidence also demonstrates that DHR is committed to combating high\nturnover rates which have plagued its child welfare workforce and is taking steps in the\nright direction.  Ensuring that counties are allocated sufficient staff constitutes one area in\nwhich DHR is succeeding.  DHR also recently has requested and received permission to\nincrease in-hire rates in larger counties; better pay obviously furthers the goal of retaining\nsocial workers and reducing turnover.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 94 &\nAppendix H.)  Additionally, as explained by Defendant in his affidavit, DHR has created\nrecruitment and retention programs in the state office, in part, to help minimize staff\nturnover.  (See Def. Aff. at 6 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761).) \nFindings Regarding DHRโs Good Faith\nAs stated, whether there is evidence of good faith on the part of DHR to comply\nwith the courtโs orders is another important consideration in the analysis of compliance\nwith consent decrees.  See Johnson, 348 F.3d at 1343 (โIn determining whether the\n[consent] decreeโs purpose has been fulfilled, the district court should consider whether\nthe City has complied in good faith with the decree.โ).  DHRโs good faith and diligent\nefforts to comply with the courtโs 1998 Order on caseload standards is not in question. \n98\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 99 of 148(cid:10)\nBeginning from the effective date of that Order, DHR has strived to attain and to maintain\ncompliance with the caseload requirements therein.  \nDHRโs good faith commitment to the courtโs 1998 Order is demonstrated in a\nmultitude of ways.  As discussed herein, DHR has complied with the tracking and\nmonitoring portions of the courtโs 1998 Order.  DHR consistently files exception reports\nin counties which have more than 10 percent of workers exceeding the standard caseloads,\nas also required by the courtโs 1998 Order.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 43\n(Doc. No. 783).) \nThe court monitor continually has observed DHRโs acts of good faith.  The court\nmonitor, for example, has noted that DHR has engaged in โ[s]ignificant effort[s]โ to\nincrease the total number of DHR child welfare workers subsequent to the effective date\nof the courtโs 1998 Order.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 12.)  Reciting the statistics,\nthe court monitor has stated, โIn October 1997, there were . . . 997 child welfare\nprofessionals; in September 2004, there [were] . . . [] 1,552 child welfare professionals,\nreflecting an approximately 60 percent increase in the number of child welfare\nprofessionals[.]โ  (Id.); (see also id. at 5 (stating that, as a result of the Consent Decree,\nโtotal child welfare workforce staffing levels have increased by [more than] 30%, due in\nlarge part to court-specified caseload standards implemented to set caseload levels for\nfrontline workersโ)); (see also Salter Aff. ยถ 10 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No.\n761) (reciting data reflecting increases in the overall number of DHR child welfare\n99\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 100 of 148(cid:10)\nworkers).)  Also, DHRโs โgood faith effortsโ in establishing registers to fill vacancies and\nin allocating additional staff in counties where needed also have been specifically noted by\nthe court monitor.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783).)  Plaintiffs also\nhave not overlooked Defendantโs demonstrated good faith.  (See, e.g., Mem. of\nUnderstanding, filed Dec. 5, 2002 (Doc. No. 650) (โThe plaintiffs and the Court Monitor\nagree that the defendant . . . has in the past two years demonstrated good faith in his\ndiligent efforts to comply with the Orders of this Court in this actionโ)); see also R.C. I,\n390 F. Supp.2d at 1036-37 \nDHRโs good faith also is amplified by the fact that, on its own initiative, DHR has\nexceeded the requirements of the courtโs 1998 Order by further reducing the number of\ncertain types of cases a social worker may carry.  As a result, Salter says that systemwide\nthe staffing allocation actually is greater than that required by the courtโs 1998 Order. \n(Salter Aff. ยถ 11 (electronically filed as Ex. 12 to Doc. No. 761).)  Finally, the court finds\nthat DHR demonstrated its good faith commitment to abide by the courtโs 1998 Order\nwhen, in 2004, DHR codified the 1998 court-ordered caseload standards in a permanent\nadministrative rule.  (See Certification of Administrative Rules Filed with the Legislative\nReference Service (Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 761)); R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1040-41; (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 39 & n.11 (Doc. No. 783).)\n100\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 101 of 148(cid:10)\nd.  The Courtโs Overall Findings of Substantial Compliance Concerning\nCore Purpose Twoโs Goal of Compliant Caseloads \nThe court is not oblivious to the struggles counties face in adhering to the courtโs\n1998 Order.  The court monitor has noted his concerns on numerous occasions.  (See, e.g.,\nCt. Monitor Nov. 2004 at 12.)  Even in his November 2004 Report, in which the court\nmonitor recommended that the court find Defendant in substantial compliance with the\nConsent Decree, he nonetheless recognized that โ[m]aintaining county staff to comply\nwith the caseloads standards is an ongoing task[.]โ  (Id. at 13.)  \nThe court likewise is cognizant of the crucial importance of DHRโs system of care\nmaintaining adequate staffing and appropriate caseloads, as repeatedly emphasized by the\ncourt monitor.  (See id. at 11, 12, 13); (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No.\n783).)  Similarly, the court recognizes, as Plaintiffs and the court monitor duly emphasize,\nthat โit is more critical than ever that caseloads [are] kept well within standards.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 94 (Doc. No. 812)); (see also Def. Aff. ยถ 6 (Doc. No. 761).) \nIt is clear that maintaining appropriate caseloads is and, quite frankly, always will be a\ntremendous challenge for DHR.  If DHR had an infinite supply of money and resources, it\ncould double or triple its workforce, increasing twofold or threefold its labor pool of\nlicensed social workers in each county, to ensure that at all times each of Alabamaโs sixty-\nseven counties had at its immediate disposal a qualified, back-up stockpile of workers to\ncover the multitude of human circumstances and frailties, some of which are expected but\n101\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 102 of 148(cid:10)\nothers of which are unanticipated, which cause not only absences and vacancies in DHRโs\nchild welfare staff, but also cause the continual, and often erratic, rise and fall in the\nnumber of children needing DHRโs care at any given time.  The ideal scenario, for\nobvious reasons, is not possible, even if it were court ordered.  \nOn the other hand, the evidence demonstrates that, as of last count, DHR had\nexceeded the courtโs spending requirements by more than $100 million.  Even taking into\naccount the court monitorโs caution that the courtโs spending requirement was a floor,\nrather than a ceiling (see Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 9 (Doc. No. 783)), DHRโs\ncommitment to secure these funds, as required by the Consent Decree, for the safety and\nwell being of the children in its care is remarkable.  (See Def. Aff. at 6 (electronically filed\nas Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761)); (see also Consent Decree at 3, 4, 34.)  In short, given all of the\nevidence in the record, the court finds that Defendant is in substantial compliance with the\ncourtโs 1998 Order on caseloads.  Cf. Kendrick v. Bland, 659 F. Supp. 1188, 1196 (W.D.\nKy. 1987) (in prison litigation where the inmates were asserting noncompliance with a\nconsent decree, the court stated: โ[g]iven the state budget and considering the realities of\nlife, the court finds that defendants do provide inmates with adequate and suitable clothing\nin compliance with the consent decreeโ), affโd, 843 F.2d 1392 (6th Cir.) and 856 F.2d 196\n(6th Cir. 1988).\nIn the courtโs considered opinion, which is based upon the courtโs entrenched\ninvolvement in this case for the past ten years, DHR is doing everything possible to\n102\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 103 of 148(cid:10)\nprovide children with well-qualified social workers who have manageable caseloads to\nensure that each child receives the quality of care to which he or she is entitled.  To\nreiterate briefly, DHR has established a Staffing Committee and comprehensive data\ncollection procedures, which effectively and accurately track caseloads on the county level\nand pinpoint problems.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 13 (stating that โDHR has\nimplemented the fundamental underlying steps to ensure adequate staffing levelsโ)); (see\nalso Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 53) (Doc. No. 783) (stating that โDHR definitely\nhas improved its collection of data both quantitatively and of the qualitative components\nof the quality assurance processes over the time of the R.C. reformโ).)  The court further\nfinds that DHR is maintaining staffing allocations which comply with the courtโs 1998\nOrder and that, on a monthly basis, the Staffing Committee continually is adjusting\nstaffing allocations in individual counties to account for increases and decreases in\ncaseloads.  \nAlthough the data reveals that, despite sufficient allocations, in some instances staff\nvacancies remain open, there is no evidence that DHR is acting dilatory or in bad faith in\nfilling open allocations.  As discussed in the previous subsection, the court monitor has\nโrecognize[d] the good faith efforts of DHR to attempt to keep counties within caseload\nstandards by providing registers to fill vacant positions in a timely manner and allocating\nadditional positions when ongoing workload/caseload demands merit an increase in a\ncountyโs allocation.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 47 (Doc. No. 783)); (see also\n103\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 104 of 148(cid:10)\nSalter Aff. at 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 779-5) (DHR has procedures in\nplace which permit a county to โautomatically request a register and start the hiring\nprocess for a new workerโ when there is a vacancy.).) \nUnder these facts, the court can envision no legitimate or beneficial reason for the\ncourt to continue its oversight in this case for the purpose of ensuring compliance with its\n1998 Order.  The court finds that judicial control is no longer necessary or practicable to\nensure compliance with said Order.  See Heath, 992 F.2d at 633 (providing that one factor\nfor consideration in deciding whether to terminate a consent decree is โthe continuing\nefficacy of the consent decreeโs enforcementโ) (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 237).  \n7.  Core Purpose Three\nCore purpose two embodies the formulation of ISPs, as does core purpose three.\nCore purpose three contemplates โactive participation by the child, parent, and foster\nparent in the planning and delivery of services, to include informed involvement so that\nthe child, parent, and foster parent have a full understanding of these services and their\nrights and options.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 58 (Doc. No. 783).)  The court\ndiscusses ISPs in this section.\nThe ISP, which is to be completed for each class member for whom a case is\nopened, โis the primary tool for identifying strengths and needs, identifying services to\naddress needs, ensuring that needed services are authorized and obtained, and measuring\n104\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 105 of 148(cid:10)\nprogress.  It also serves as an organizer of activity and a tool for communication with\nthose involved with the family and class member.โ  (Implementation Plan, System\nProcesses and Services, at 9-14.)  The Implementation Plan states further that, โ[i]n order\nfor the counties to practice consistently with the decree, it is necessary for them, among\nother things, to . . . develop individualized, needs-based service plans, based on\ncomprehensive assessments of strengths and needs[,]โ for each child.  (Implementation\nPlan, conversion chapter (elaborating upon the purposes and requirements of the ISP));\n(see also Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 3 (Doc. No. 783).) \na.  Positions of the Parties and the Court Monitor\nIn his November 2004 Report, in which the court monitor recommended a finding\nof substantial compliance, the court monitor stated that ISPs are โbeing met with\nexceedingly high consistency.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 59.)  The court,\nhowever, in R.C. I found that the court monitorโs report was โincomplete as to what facts\nform[ed] the basis of the court monitorโs conclusion.โ  390 F. Supp.2d at 1053.  In his\nsubsequent report to the court, submitted in November 2005, the court monitor revisited\nthe evidence and, as a result, disagreed with Defendantโs then current assertion that โevery\nchild in care has case decisions now driven by the ISPโ and that โchildren and families\nattend ISPs and help develop their case plans.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 9 (Doc.\nNo. 783).)  Plaintiffs also have expressed their concern about the number of counties in\n105\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 106 of 148(cid:10)\nwhich ISPs have been rated as an area needing improvement.  (Doc. No. 767 at 10); (Doc.\nNo. 781 at 9.)\nb.  Timely Completion of ISPs\nDHR sets certain time lines for the completion of the initial ISP and for the\ncompletion of updates to the ISP in foster care and protective services cases.  DHR also\ncollects and tracks data to measure whether counties are complying with these guidelines.\nWhether a childโs ISP is being completed within the time lines designated by DHRโs\npolicy has been one of the โquantitativeโ indicators the court monitor has examined to\nassess how DHRโs system of care is performing.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report\n(Doc. No. 783).)  \nThe court finds that the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews reveal positive data in\nthe area of timely completion of ISPs for children.  In the court monitorโs April 2006\nReport, a chart is displayed for each county reflecting data comparisons in several\nperformance categories at the time of the countyโs assertion and in 2006.50  Four of the\ncategories reflect the percentage of ISPs completed within policy guidelines for (1) initial\nfoster care ISPs, (2) updated foster care ISPs, (3) initial protective services ISPs, and\n50 โAssertion,โ as that word has been used throughout this litigation, refers to a\ncountyโs pronouncement that the county believes that it has reformed its practices in a\nmanner consistent with the Consent Decree.  Throughout this litigation, after a county\nmade this assertion, the court monitor commenced an on-site review to determine\nindependently whether the county was substantially complying with the Consent Decree. \n106\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 107 of 148(cid:10)\n(4) updated protective services ISPs.51  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 13, 20, 28,\n36, 44, 53, 61, 69, 78, 88) (Doc. No. 812).)  In Chambers, Conecuh, Jackson, Lauderdale,\nMontgomery and Randolph counties, this data reflects overwhelmingly that ISPs are being\ncompleted within policy time lines in each of the four ISP categories.  (See, e.g., id. at 13\n(in Chambers County โISPs were current at the time of assertion and are mostly current\nnowโ)); (see id. at 20 (in two ISP categories, Randolph County scored 100 percent; it\nscored 98 percent in the other two ISP categories)); (see id. at 28 (in Conecuh County,\nISPs are being completed within policy guidelines in 100 percent of cases)); (see id. at 35,\n36 (in Jackson County, โISPs are currently within policy time linesโ)); (see id. at 44 (in\nLauderdale County, 100 percent of the ISPs in three categories were completed within\npolicy time lines, and 97 percent of the ISPs were timely completed in the fourth\ncategory); (see id. at 60, 61 (in Montgomery County, โISPs are being completed and\nupdated between policy time linesโ).)  \nIn Jefferson County, the percentages in the four ISP categories ranged from 89.6\npercent to 97.6 percent.  (See id. at 88.)  Marshall County had percentages of 81, 90, 95\nand 98 in the four ISP categories.  (See id. at 78.)  Lee County revealed percentages of 94,\n99, 99 and 100 percent, and the court monitor noted that, in Lee County, โISPs are\ngenerally being completed and updated within policy time lines, with the exception of\n51 Relatedly, the court notes that these four categories of data were recently added\nas a result of upgrades to DHRโs data collection capabilities; thus, in these four categories\nthere is no comparative data.

The lowest rating occurred in Marshall County, in which 81 percent\nof cases had ISPs completed within time lines in the category of updated protective\nservices ISPs. \nOverall, the court finds that the data regarding the timely completion of ISPs is\npositive.  The court monitor has expressed the same:  โThe monitor concurs that\nindividualized service plans are being completed for most children and families receiving\nservices in a timely manner, as evidenced by the โpercentages of ISPs completedโ data\nincluded as an attachment to Mr. Deanโs affidavit.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 at 10 (Doc.\nNo. 783)); (Larry Dean Aff. (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761).)  The court finds that DHR is\nperforming in a substantially compliant manner concerning the timely completion of ISPs.  \nc.  Serviceable ISPs\nThe court monitor, however, has noted that timely completion of ISPs does not\nguaranty that the ISP is functioning effectively for the child.  The QSR reviews include an\nexamination of whether ISPs โare operating functionally in the manner intended by the\npractice principlesโ of the Consent Decree.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 5 (Doc. No.\n783).)  In his November 2005 Report, the court monitor observed that โquantitative dataโ\nfrom the QSR reviews โregarding the timeliness of completing ISP team meetings\n108\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 109 of 148(cid:10)\nprovided by . . . DHR show that a number of counties report having ISPs conducted on a\nregular basis according to policy expectations[.]โ  (Id. at 36.)  However, the court monitor\nstated that the evidence at the time โshow[ed] that the function and quality of the ISP\nprocess [are] not being maintained.โ  (Id.); (see also id. at 54 (raising a question โabout\nwhether the documentation of ISPs being completed in accordance with policy time lines\nis a meaningful measure of practice as required by the principlesโ of the Consent Decree).) \nSome of the questions which QSR reviewers probe in order to assess how ISPs are\nfunctioning for a child are set out in the footnote below.52  It is in these areas of inquiry,\nthe ratings of which were compiled as part of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews and\nwhich are reflected in the categories of โindividual service planโ and โservice\ncoordination,โ that the court monitor concluded that performance was lacking.  The court\nlikewise recognizes, as discussed below, that ISPs are not driving practice, as they should\nbe, in all counties.  \n52  โIs the ISP relevant to the child and familyโs needs and goals?โ  โIs the ISP\nconsistent with the long-term view?โ  โDoes the ISP address focal concerns, underlying\ncauses of behavior, known health or safety risks, and stress positive outcomes?โ  โDoes\nthe selection of ISP strategies, supports, services, and time lines make sense?โ  โDoes the\nISP reflect the preferences and choices of those who are expected to participate in and\nbenefit from the services offered?โ  โDoes the ISP provide concurrent and safety\ncomponents, as necessary?โ  โAre the services/activities specified in the ISP being\nimplemented in a timely manner?โ  โIs there effective coordination and continuity in the\norganization and provision of services for this child and family?โ  โIs there accountability\nfor assuring that the ISP is implemented, monitoring activities are conducted, and\ninformation is shared with the service team so that smart and timely changes are made in\nstrategies, supports, and services across settings and providers?โ  (See Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2005 Report at 30 & Appendix A (Doc. No. 783).) \n109\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 110 of 148(cid:10)\nd.  The 2006 On-Site Sustainability Reviews\nTurning to the evidence garnered as a result of the 2006 on-site sustainability\nreviews, the court begins with the favorable evidence regarding the performance of the\nsmaller counties.  In two of the small counties, i.e., Chambers and Conecuh, it was\nspecifically noted that โISPs are working documents and are driving practice.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 12, 27 (Doc. No. 812).)  In Chambers County, where\nโ[r]eviewers found a consistency between ISPs and services provided,โ 100 percent of the\ncases were acceptable in the categories of โISPโ and โservice coordination.โ  (See id.\nat 11.)  In Conecuh County, where โ[r]eviewers observed a consistency between\n[individual] service plans and implementation of supports,โ 80 percent of the cases were\nacceptable in the ISP category, and 100 percent of the cases were acceptable in the area of\nservice coordination.  (See id. at 26, 27.)  \nLauderdale County, a mid-sized county, also fared well, with acceptable ratings\ngiven in 94 percent of the cases in the categories of โISPโ and โservice coordination.โ  (Id.\nat 42.)  In Randolph County, a sustaining county and also a small county, the court\nmonitor stated that this county โneeds to make improvement in . . . functional assessment\nand the resulting ISP required by core purpose two.โ  (See id. at 21.)  Randolph County\nhad acceptable ISPs and service coordination ratings in 80 percent of the cases.  (Id.\nat 18.)\n110\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 111 of 148(cid:10)\nThe evidence surrounding the quality of ISPs was less favorable in other counties. \nIn Jackson County, where the lowest domain rating was in the category of โISPโ at 60\npercent, โ[r]eviewers found ISPs to be not driving practice, not containing measurable\ngoals and objectives, and lacking long-term view and direction.โ  (See id. at 31.)  The\ncategory of service coordination, however, received a favorable rating with 100 percent of\ncases deemed acceptable.  (See id. at 34.)  \nLee County had acceptable ISP ratings in 67 percent of the cases reviewed and\nacceptable service coordination ratings in 83 percent of the cases reviewed.  (Id. at 46,\n51.)  The court monitor indicated that, โwhile children are getting services, there are some\nweaknesses in how well the ISP is addressing the underlying conditions that will result in\nsuccessful resolution or safe case closure.โ  (Id. at 46.)  The court monitor expressed a\nsimilar concern about Montgomery County, where the percentage of acceptable cases in\nthe category of ISPs was 56 percent and the percentage of acceptable cases in service\ncoordination was 83 percent.  (Id. at 55, 59.)  \nMacon and Marshall counties also scored low with only 30 percent and 33 percent,\nrespectively, of cases receiving an acceptable rating in the category of ISPs.  (Id. at 63, 67,\n71, 76.)  The percentage of acceptable cases in the category of service coordination was\nsomewhat better:  71 percent in Macon County and 73 percent in Marshall County.  (Id.\nat 67, 76.)  The court monitor observed in Macon County that the low ISP rating indicated\nโsignificant weaknesses in practice.โ  (Id. at 63.)  In Marshall County, โ[s]ome providers\n111\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 112 of 148(cid:10)\nand educators reported that ISPs arenโt perceived as collaborative and that they are not\nalways included in the processโ; however, โ[f]oster parents generally reported that they\nwere included in ISP meetings, but they reported [that] there were not enough caseworkers\nor foster parents to meet the needs.โ  (Id. at 78.)  Jefferson County also received\nunfavorable ratings, with 47 percent of cases in the category of ISPs receiving acceptable\nratings and 60 percent of cases in the category of service coordination obtaining\nacceptable ratings.  (Id. at 88.)\ne.  Findings\nThe court finds that a procedural barrier to effective and well-functioning ISPs is\nthe complexity surrounding the ISP process.  A reverberating theme emanating from the\ncourt monitorโs April 2006 Report is that the ISP requirements are overly burdensome and\ntoo complex.  Complaints included the following:  โISPs [are] hard for families to\nunderstandโ (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 12 (Doc. No. 812)); โthe paperwork\nexpectations and documentation redundancy combined with mandatory requirements made\ndoing the necessary practice and hands-on work with children and families very difficultโ\n(id. at 12, 48); โISPs are too long and overwhelming for familiesโ (id. at 19); โ[t]he ISP\nwas reported to be too cumbersome, and it had become hard for families to understand\n(this was reported in virtually all counties by staff).โ  (Id. at 78.)\n112\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 113 of 148(cid:10)\nThe court monitor also has observed that the โISP process could benefit from [a]\ncontinued focus on developing plans that are easy for families to understand and useful to\nachieving resolution of problems.โ  (Id. at 19.)  Having studied the criticisms of the\npresent ISP process, the court concurs with the court monitorโs assessment.  The court\nconcludes that, although there is evidence that ISPs are being completed in a timely\nmanner, ISPs are not performing in the manner intended by the Consent Decree; the\nstandard of substantial compliance has not been met.  At the same time, the court also\nrecognizes, as Defendant aptly states, that โISP development is, and always will be, an\nongoing process for [DHRโs] county staff.โ  (Butler Aff. ยถ 7 (Ex. to Doc. No. 825).)  \nThe court, however, does not find that the present deficiency forecloses a finding of\nsystemwide substantial compliance.  An underlying common denominator in this lawsuit,\none echoed by the court monitor and not disputed by the parties, is that DHRโs child\nwelfare system is an evolving system of care, one which must remain under vigilant\nwatch.  The parties have recognized that changes in practice and performance are expected\nand indeed are inevitable.  (Cf. Implementation Plan, Introduction, at 5 (โThe process of\nchange is dynamic.  As information is learned about the effectiveness of intervention and\nreform strategies, plans may need to be revised, services modified, steps reordered,\nmistakes corrected and systems changed.โ).)\nChange has occurred, and the court expects, with emphasis, that DHR will work\ndiligently and as quickly as possible to simplify and to improve the entire ISP process so\n113\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 114 of 148(cid:10)\nthat ISPs can return to the forefront as the mechanism which drives practice in all\ncounties.  The court, though, does not deem it necessary to retain jurisdiction until such\ntime that DHR remedies and revitalizes the ISP process for this reason.  Throughout the\nlong duration of this case, as set out in other parts of this opinion, DHR has demonstrated\nits good faith commitment to achieving performance within its child welfare system which\ncomplies with the dictates of the Consent Decree, and Defendant has complied with other\ndirectives issued by this court.  See Sims, 9 F. Supp.2d at 1287 (discussing factors which\nthe court should consider in deciding whether termination of a consent decree is\nappropriate, including โwhether retention of judicial control is necessary or practical to\nachieve compliance with any outstanding ordersโ).\nThe courtโs finding is based also on evidence which reveals that DHR is not\nstagnant, but continually is implementing refinements in order to improve its child welfare\nsystem.  The evidence reveals that Defendant is aware of the problems infecting the ISP\nprocess and already has initiated some corrective measures.  For example, in his Affidavit,\nButler states, โTo improve ISP quality, DHR is continuing to provide consultation and\ntraining to all our county and state staff.โ  (Butler Aff. ยถ 7 (Ex. to Doc. No. 825).)  โThe\nDHR child welfare consultant staff has recently begun new training for counties across the\nstate to address ISP development and assessment of family dynamics.โ  (Id.)\nAdditionally, Angela Tanveer (โTanveerโ), who signed her affidavit on April 28,\n2006, in her capacity as DHRโs assistant director for child welfare for Jefferson County,\n114\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 115 of 148(cid:10)\nhas explained the mechanisms recently implemented in Jefferson County to address\nproblems in the area of ISPs.  Tanveer says that all regions of Jefferson County \nreceived training that consisted of a two-day interactive workshop on\nassessments and ISPs.  State DHR Child Welfare consultants met with units\nin each region to train individual workers on how to improve their ISP and\nassessment practice.  I am meeting with small groups of regional supervisors\neach month to help them learn how to assist their workers in improving ISP\npractice and how to focus on outcomes.\n(See Tanveer Aff. ยถ 9 (Ex. to Doc. No. 811).)\nThere also is other evidence that DHR is making strides in the right direction in the\narena of ISPs.  In one of his briefs (Doc. No. 811), Defendant sets out a chart which\ncompares the system performance data for counties discussed in the court monitorโs\nNovember 2004 Report with the current data from the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews. \n(Doc. No. 811 at 7); (see also Oliver Wayne Scott Aff. (Attach. 1 to Doc. No. 811).)  This\ndata reflects a positive trend.  Overall, the percentage of acceptable cases in the category\nof ISP improved by 21 percentage points (41 percent to 62 percent), and, in the category\nof service coordination, the percentage of acceptable cases improved by 25 percentage\npoints, from 57 percent to 82 percent.  (Doc. No. 811 at 7.)\nIn sum, the court expects that DHR will follow through posthaste with completion\nof the necessary reforms to the ISP process; however, based upon DHRโs record of\ncompliance in this litigation and the improvements demonstrated thus far, the court finds\n115\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 116 of 148(cid:10)\nthat continued judicial oversight is not necessary to bring Defendant in substantial\ncompliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree concerning serviceable ISPs.\n8.  Core Purpose Five\nCore purpose five embodies the operating principles of the Consent Decree\npertaining to stability and permanency in the class membersโ living situations, including, if\nin the childrenโs best interest, that when children are removed from their homes, siblings\nare placed together and familial relationships are maintained through visitations and other\nmeans.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1046.  The court has reviewed all of the evidence\nrelating to core purpose five and finds that Defendant has demonstrated that DHR will\nremain in substantial compliance with core purpose five of the Consent Decree.  The court\nexplains its reasoning.\nRegarding permanency, the court monitor has written, โ[T]he primary mission of\nchild welfare is to ensure that children live in safe and permanent homes.โ  (Ct. Monitor\nApril 2003 Report at 24.)  โPermanency is defined as ensuring that children live in\npermanent, stable, and family settings and is achieved through either the successful\nreunification with family members, or when reunification with family (or placement with\nother relatives) is not possible, through adoption.โ  (Id.)\nIn some instances as indicated, permanency can be achieved through adoption or a\ncustody transfer of the child to permanent placement with a relative.  In other instances,\n116\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 117 of 148(cid:10)\nthe permanency goal is to keep the child in the home or, where the child has been\nremoved, to return the child to that home, or in some cases, to place the child in long-term\ncare with a foster parent.  An additional permanency goal is APPLA or โanother planned\npermanent living arrangement,โ previously referred to as long-term foster care, which is\nprimarily geared toward those children who will reach the age of majority while receiving\nfoster care services.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 49); (see also Consent Decree\nat 9-10 (ยถ 17)); (see, e.g., Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 9, 16, 32, 39, 48, 57, 65, 73,\n83 (Doc. No. 812) (delineating permanency goals of the children whose cases were\nreviewed).)  Commendably, in nine of the ten counties, which were part of the 2006 on-\nsite sustainability reviews, every child who was subject to review had in place a\npermanency goal.53  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 9, 16, 24, 32, 39, 48, 57, 64, 73\n(Doc. No. 812).)  \nEstablishing a permanency goal for each child is one factor in the equation for\nmeasuring DHRโs attainment with the permanency component of the Consent Decree. \nAnother way to gauge compliance as to permanency is to assess the length of time it takes\nfor a child to achieve permanency in his or her living situation.  As the court and the court\nmonitor previously have recognized, timely achieving permanency in a childโs living\n53 The exception is Jefferson County.  Of the thirty children reviewed in Jefferson\nCounty, two of the children did not have in place a defined permanency goal.  (See Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 83 (Doc. No. 812).)\n117\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 118 of 148(cid:10)\nsituation is a critical component of core purpose five.54  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d\nat 1053-54.  DHR compiles data on a county-by-county basis of the percentage of children\nwho remain in foster care for more than thirteen months.  Similarly, recent federal\nlegislation, namely, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, P.L. 105-89 (Nov. 19,\n1997 (โASFAโ), sets twelve months as the time in which permanency is to be achieved55;\nhowever, for purposes of the Consent Decree in this case, the court monitor is of the\nopinion that โsetting a standard that every child must achieve permanency within 12\nmonths will likely not be achieved.โ56  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 48); (see also\nCt. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 60 (Doc. No. 783) (โ[T]here are significant challenges in\nmeeting the 13-month time-line requirements for the achievement of permanency.โ).)\nThe court monitor previously has written as follows:  \nMany issues are going to determine what actual time lines can be achieved\nfor each child.  These include the age of children, the per capita entries into\ncare (fewer entries mean those who enter are more likely to have more\ncomplex issues to resolve to achieve permanency), the range of emotional\n54 Some questions used by QSR reviewers to examine permanence are as follows:\n(1) Is the child living in a home that the child, caregivers, and other stakeholders believe\nwill endure until the child becomes independent?  (2) If not, is a permanency plan\npresently being implemented on a timely basis [consistent with ASFA time lines] that will\nensure that the child will live in a safe, appropriate, and permanent home?โ  (Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2004 Report, Appendix G.)\n55 Not only is permanency an important component of the Consent Decree, but of\nfederal legislation as well.  (See Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 48.)\n56 Indeed, as noted by the court monitor, under the ASFA, no state received an\nacceptable rating in the performance of permanency achievement.  (Ct. Monitor Nov.\n2004 Report at 50 (Doc. No. 783).) \n118\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 119 of 148(cid:10)\nand behavioral conditions of the children, and the amount of effort and\ncommitment to keep children with their families.  \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 50.)  For the foregoing reason, the court monitor has not\nplaced undue emphasis on compliance with a rigid time guideline in measuring substantial\ncompliance in individual counties.  Although the ASFA twelve-month time line has been\nincorporated into the QSR review questions in the area of permanency (see Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2004 Report, Appendix B), the court monitor consistently has deemed individual\ncounties in substantial compliance even where the data revealed that the majority of the\nchildren were achieving permanency in excess of twelve and even thirteen months.  For\ninstance, in the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, the court monitor found that counties\nwere in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree, even though the percentages of\nchildren in the majority of these counties who had been in care for more than thirteen\nmonths were substantial, extending into the seventieth percentile range in Randolph\nCounty (74 percent) and Conecuh County (71 percent).57  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor April\n2006 Report at 20, 28 (Doc. No. 812).) \n57 In Chambers and Lauderdale counties, 69 percent and 64 percent, respectively,\nof the children in care remained in care for periods of time exceeding thirteen months,\nand the percentage of children in care for more than thirteen months in Jackson County\nwas 44 percent.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 13, 36, 44.)  Indeed, Lee and\nMontgomery counties were the only two counties making headway in reducing the time\nperiods during which children were in DHR care.  The percentage of children in care\nmore than thirteen months decreased in Lee County from 58 percent in 2002 to 36\npercent as revealed in the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, and similar improvements\nwere seen in Montgomery County which effectively reduced the number of children in\ncare from 62 percent to 28 percent over a period of nine years.  (Id. at 52-53, 60-61.) \n119\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 120 of 148(cid:10)\n  As indicated, there now is additional data in the record on the issue of permanency\nas a result of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews which was not before the court when\nthe court evaluated Defendantโs first motion to terminate the consent decree.58  The\nfollowing indicates the percentage of children reviewed in each county who received an\nโacceptableโ rating in the area of permanence:  (1) Chambers (90 percent); (2) Randolph\n(60 percent); (3) Conecuh (80 percent); (4) Jackson (90 percent); (5) Lauderdale (83\npercent); (6) Lee (94 percent); (7) Montgomery (83 percent); (8) Macon (60 percent);\n(9) Marshall (67 percent); and (10) Jefferson (63 percent).  (Ct. Monitor April 2006\nReport at 10, 17, 25, 33, 41, 50, 58, 66, 75, 85) (Doc. No. 812).)  Viewing the data on\npermanency in the aggregate for the seven sustaining counties, the percentage of\nacceptable cases is 83 percent, which the court finds to be satisfactory under the Consent\n58 Previously, the court monitor determined that there was insufficient data from\nwhich he could form a reasoned opinion as to whether DHR was substantially complying\nwith the goal of timely achieving permanency in a childโs living situation.  See R.C. I,\n390 F. Supp.2d at 1053-54 (citing Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 50.)  At the time, he\nstated, โThe achievement of permanency . . . is a complex issue that needs more data\nanalysis and more detailed study.โ  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 50.)  The court\nmonitor based his opinion on the limited data provided to him on permanency for fiscal\nyears 2000 through 2003.  See R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1053.\n120\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 121 of 148(cid:10)\nDecreeโs standards.59  (Id. at 90.)  The percentage in the aggregate for the three non-\nsustaining counties is 63 percent.  (Id. at 92.) \nAlthough four of the counties scored in the sixtieth percentile in the domain of\npermanency (i.e., Randolph, Macon, Marshall and Jefferson), the court finds that these\npercentages cannot be viewed in isolation.  (See, e.g., id. at 21 (โappropriate assessment of\nunderlying conditions and the whole family situation are necessary to achieve\npermanenceโ).  Rather, the issues surrounding permanency must be examined in\nconjunction with other factors, such as the appropriateness of placement,60 a category in\nwhich all of the counties scored exceptionally high marks as follows:  (1) Chambers (100\npercent); (2) Randolph (100 percent); (3) Conecuh (90 percent); (4) Jackson (99 percent);\n(5) Lauderdale (100 percent); (6) Lee (100 percent); (7) Montgomery (100 percent);\n59 The court notes that Paul Butler (โButlerโ), who at the time of the submission of\nhis affidavit was the interim director of DHRโs family services division, points out that\nthe data examined by the court monitor โis point-in-time data and includes data on some\nchildren who have been in care since before the implementation of the R.C. principles in\nall of the counties.โ  (Butler Aff. ยถ 8 (Ex. to Doc. No. 825).)  Butler states that โ[a] much\nbetter approach for reviewing the trends for Alabamaโs foster children comes in looking\nat cohort groupings of children who enter care over the years.  Cohort data is data on\nchildren who enter care for the first time in any given year.โ  (Id.)  He concludes, โIn\nlooking at this [cohort] data, improvements in practice can be seen.โ  (Id.)  While the\ncourt has considered Butlerโs opinion in reaching its findings herein, the court has given\nonly limited weight to Butlerโs conclusion, given that the conclusion is, in large part just\nthat, a conclusion.\n60 The question used by QSR reviewers to assess appropriateness of placement is: \nIs the child in the most appropriate placement consistent with the childโs needs, age,\nability, and peer group and consistent with the childโs language and culture?  (See Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2004 Report, Appendix B.)\n121\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 122 of 148(cid:10)\n(8) Macon (90 percent); (9) Marshall (94 percent); and (10) Jefferson (97 percent). \nAdditionally, it cannot be ignored that, as discussed in other parts of this opinion, the\nevidence indicates that at least part of the challenge in achieving permanence has been\nsparked by a factor outside of DHRโs control, that is, the adverse consequences on\nAlabama families due to the rapid increase in the use and production of crystal\nmethamphetamine.  \nThe court recognizes, as pointed out by Plaintiffs (see Doc. No. 820 at 23, 28), that\nthe court monitor observed in his April 2006 Report that permanence is a challenge even\nfor some of the counties which are sustaining substantial compliance.61  (See, e.g., Ct.\nMonitor April 2006 Report at 14, 19, 21 (Randolph County); id. at 29 (Conecuh County);\nid. at 36 (Jackson County).)  The court observes that these weaknesses in permanence,\nhowever, were not a barrier to the court monitorโs finding that seven counties were\nsubstantially complying with the Consent Decree.  Given that the time frame for achieving\npermanency involves consideration of the individual and unique circumstances of each\nchild and his or her environment, the court finds that it is not always workable to evaluate\nsubstantial compliance under the Consent Decree solely based upon an unbendable\ntwelve-month, or even thirteen-month, guideline for achieving permanency. \n61 For other counties, achieving permanence was not a challenge.  In Lee and\nMontgomery counties, for instance, the court monitor noted no weaknesses regarding the\ngoal of permanence.  (Id. Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 54, 62.)\n122\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 123 of 148(cid:10)\nImportantly, there is evidence that DHR closely is monitoring permanency issues. \n(See, e.g., Def. Aff. at 8 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761) (โAttaining timely\npermanency for children remains one of the greatest challenges of the system, and it is a\nsubject on which we have worked diligently to produce better results.โ).)  For example,\nalthough Randolph County scored lower than other counties at 60 percent in the category\nof โpermanence,โ the court monitor observed Randolph Countyโs โdiligent effort in\nseeking permanence for each child and that teenagers presented significant challenges to\nachieving permanence.โ  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 19 (Doc. No. 812).) \nAdditional evidence that DHR is focusing on permanency in Randolph County in an effort\nto improve performance lies in statements from stakeholders who have โconsistently\nreport[ed] that DHR is looking at permanency issues for children when they first come\ninto care.โ  (Id. at 20); (see also id. (in Randolph County, โ[f]oster parents feel that DHR\nmakes good decisions about returning children home or placing them with relativesโ).) \nRandolph County also is making positive strides in the area of permanency, as the court\nmonitor observed that โ[p]ermanency plans are being developed timely and are moving\ntoward adoptions sooner.โ  (Id. at 20.)\nMoreover, on the subject of permanence, Defendant has submitted other favorable\nevidence, demonstrating that the percentage of children in foster care continues to\ndecrease.  (See Butler Aff. ยถ 9 (Ex. to Doc. No. 825).)  As stated by Butler, โ[t]he children\nwho entered care in 2001 had a median time in care of 387 days.  For 2002, the median\n123\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 124 of 148(cid:10)\nnumber of days in care was 389, and in 2003 it was 346.  For the children who entered\ncare in 2004, the median time in care was 293 days.โ  (Id. (internal footnote added).) \nRelatedly, Butler points out that DHR has โdecreased the number of re-admissions to\ncare.โ  (Id.)  He says that, โ[o]f the children who entered care in FY [fiscal year] 2001,\napproximately 12 have returned to care.  However, of those children who entered care in\nFY 2004, less than 8% have reentered care.  No child who entered care since 2002 has had\nmore than three admissions into care.โ  (Id.)  Finally, Butler recites that, of the children\nwho entered care in fiscal year 2004, 74.3 percent have returned to their home or achieved\npermanency through other means, such as relative placement.  (Id.)\nDefendant also has submitted evidence of methods which DHR has implemented to\nassess performance in the area of permanence and to target needed interventions.  One\nsuch method is the โQuarterly County Permanency Profile.โ  (See Doc. No. 779 at 27.) \nAs explained by Cantrell, the program administrator in DHRโs Family Services Division,\nthis report provides a data profile of the permanency goals, length of stay and compliance\nwith the ASFA.  (Cantrell Dep. at 96 (Attach. K to Doc. No. 779)); (Doc. No. 779 at 27.) \nThe report encompasses information regarding in-home and out-of-home care.  (Cantrell\nDep. at 96); (Doc. No. 779 at 27.)  Defendant also has provided evidence and discussion\nof certain data threshold measurements which have been established by DHR for the\npurpose of measuring whether a county is achieving permanency goals, as well as safety\ngoals.  (Doc. No. 779 at 28); (Cantrell Dep. at 51-52, 73.)  In instances where the data\n124\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 125 of 148(cid:10)\nreveals substandard performance as to the permanency goal, DHR has implemented a\nmulti-step protocol to correct the deficiency.  (Doc. No. 779 at 28 (citing Margaret\nBonham Dep. at 51-52, 73, attach. L).)    \nDHRโs proven ability to improve deficient areas of performance, including the area\nof permanence, is evidenced in Jackson County.  In the review preceding the 2006 on-site\nsustainability review, Jackson County exhibited โsignificant practice issuesโ in most areas\nof performance, including permanency.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 29 (Doc. No.\n812).)  Impressively, in the 2006 on-site sustainability review, 90 percent of the children\nreviewed in Jackson County received an acceptable rating in the area of permanency. \nProblems in Jackson County have been identified and corrected which is precisely what\nthe Consent Decree seeks to achieve.\nRelatedly, as stated, adoption is an avenue by which permanency can be achieved. \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 13 (Doc. No. 783).)  The evidence in the area of\nadoptions is favorable, with the court monitor confirming that โ[t]he number of completed\nadoptions and the number of children with adoptions as a permanency goal has increased.โ \n(Id.); (Lapsley Aff.)  Indeed, it is noteworthy that DHRโs average time to adoption exceeds\n125\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 126 of 148(cid:10)\nthe goals of the ASFA.62  (See Doc. No. at n.14.)  DHR also monitors adoption placements\nthrough reports and data compilation, which are reviewed on a regular basis.  (See Doc.\nNo. 779 at 29); (Cantrall Dep. at 36-38, 41.)\nCore purpose five also requires consideration of whether familial relationships are\nbeing maintained through visitations and placement with siblings when children are\nremoved from their homes.  In his November 2005 report, the court monitor noted that\nonly 63 percent of the children included in the QSR reviews received an acceptable rating\nin the category for โmaintaining family connections.โ  He concluded that this data\nindicated that there was โsignificant variability in how this basic practice principle is\nimplemented in frontline practice since conversion was achieved in some counties.โ  (Ct.\nMonitor Nov. 2005 Report at 15 (Doc. No. 783).)  Significantly, in DHRโs favor, the\nsubsequent data gathered as a result of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews reveals\nsubstantial improvement in DHRโs practice of maintaining family connections.  On pages\n62 The court notes that Defendant has pointed out that the Consent Decreeโs\nemphasis on family reunification in many cases has resulted in delays in the time to\nadoption and, thus, runs counter to the goals of the ASFA.  Defendant makes this point as\nsupport for his proposition that โ[t]he friction between the principles of the 1991 Consent\nDecree and Congressโ enactment of differing objectives in the Act demonstrates another\nreason that [the] ancient Consent Decree[] should be terminated.โ  (Doc. No. 825\nat 11 n.13.)  The court simply observes that Defendant complains that the Consent Decree\nshould be terminated as archaic, but at the same time ignores the fact that DHR never\nsought the arguably more reasonable remedy of modification on the basis of ASFAโs\nenactment.  See Philadelphia Welfare Rights Organization v. Shapp, 602 F.2d 1114,\n1120-21 (3d Cir. 1979) (court has power to modify โcomplex ongoing remedial [consent]\ndecreeโ); Wyatt, By and Through Rawlins v. King, 803 F. Supp. 377, 384-85 (M.D. Ala.\n1992) (discussing the standard for seeking modification of consent decrees in institutional\nreform cases as set out in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County, 502 U.S. 367 (1992)).\n126\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 127 of 148(cid:10)\n90 and 91 of his April 2006 Report, the court monitor compiled charts showing the\ncombined performance ratings for the seven counties which he determined were sustaining\nsubstantial performance (i.e., Chambers, Conecuh, Jackson, Lauderdale, Lee, Montgomery\nand Randolph).  In the domain of โmaintaining family connections,โ these seven counties\nreceived an aggregate favorable rating of 89 percent.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report\nat 90 (Doc. No. 812).)  Although the three non-sustaining counties received a lower rating\nof 72 percent in this domain, the trends overall are moving in the right direction.  (See id.\nat 92); (see also Baker Aff., titled โChildren in Careโ at 10-11 (electronically filed as Ex.\n36 to Doc. No. 761)), in which Baker attests that those โsiblings who are not together have\nbeen deemed as having particular needs that may not be met unless they are served in\ndifferent settings.  These issues are seriously considered within the context of the\nIndividualized Service Plan for that child and family, and placement decisions are made as\na result.โ).)   \nProviding a child who is in out-of-home care with a stable home environment, with\nminimal risk of placement disruption, is another component of core purpose five.  In his\nNovember 2004 Report, the court monitor examined the available data from January 2000\nto September 2003, but deemed the data insufficient in some respects.  (See Ct. Monitor\nNov. 2004 Report at 50); R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1054 (observing absence of data). \nHowever, in his November 2005 Report, the court monitor examined more recent data and\nmade several positive comments based upon this data.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report\n127\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 128 of 148(cid:10)\nat 15 (Doc. No. 783).)  In that report, he set out a chart, titled โFoster Care Data 2005,โ\nwhich displays, on a county-by-county basis, the average number of placements for\nchildren in out-of-home care and the average length of continuous time children are in out-\nof-home care.  (Id. at 15-16.)  Based upon a comparison of this data to earlier data, he\nobserved that, in 2001, โ63% of children were discharged with not more than two\nplacements,โ and that, โ[i]n 2004, 85.4% of children were discharged with less than two\nplacements, with 59.1% discharged after one placement.โ  (Id. at 17.)  From the same data,\nthe court monitor also observes that โthere has been a reduction of almost one placement\nchange on average for children in care since the inception of R.C.โ and that, โ[o]verall,\nthere has been significant improvement in reducing the number of placements.โ  (Id. at 17,\n59.)  \nAlso part of the record are the results from the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews\nwhich show that counties are maintaining success in keeping at bay the number of\nplacements for children in out-of-home care.  (See Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report,\nAppendix G (Doc. No. 812).)  Examining the data in Appendix G, which charts the\nnumber of placements for children in DHR care in the ten counties subject to the 2006 on-\nsite sustainability reviews, the court monitor reports favorably as follows:  \nWhen data from that chart are compared with the number of moves that\nchildren were experiencing when the initial R.C. needs assessment was\ndone, significant progress has been made in reducing the number of moves\nchildren experience.  At that time, only 42% of children in care had two\nmoves or less.  In the current data, 60% to 70% of children experience two\nmoves or less.\n128\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 129 of 148(cid:10)\n(Id. at 89-90.)  Even Macon, Marshall and Jefferson counties โ the counties which the\ncourt monitor found are not sustaining substantial compliance โ  are performing at these\nlevels.  The percentage of children in care who have experienced two placements or less in\nJefferson, Macon and Marshall counties is 66 percent, 66 percent and 72 percent,\nrespectively.  (See id., Appendix G.)\nAs a final observation regarding placements, Defendant has emphasized DHRโs\nnational success in the area of reducing the number of placements of children in state care. \n(See Doc. No. 825 at 12); (Butler Aff. ยถ 10 (Ex. to Doc. No. 825.)  The federal\ngovernment measures a stateโs success in stability by comparing the percentage of children\nwho have less than three placements in a given year.  (Butler Aff. ยถ 10.)  Under the ASFA,\na state receives a โpassingโ grade when the state meets the threshold of 86.7 percent.  (Id.) \nIn 2005, approximately 93 percent of the children in Alabamaโs care had less than three\nplacements, which placed DHR in the top three leading states in the nation.63  (Id.) \nFinally, the court observes that, in the areas comprising core purpose five, there\nwere no notable negative comments from stakeholders, but there were some notable\npositive comments, which as stated constitute an important component of the methodology\nused by the court monitor during on-site sustainability reviews.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor\n63 The court notes that Butler has pointed out that Glenda Peters, one of DHRโs\nprogram managers, has been asked by the Agency for Children and Families, which is\npart of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to speak at a national\nconference on how Alabama DHR is achieving such excellent results in reducing multiple\nplacements for children in foster care.  (Butler Aff. ยถ 10.)\n129\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 130 of 148(cid:10)\nApril 2006 Report at 2 (Doc. No. 812).)  In Chambers County, โ[f]oster parents and other\nstakeholders report[ed] feeling supported by DHR and describe[d] workers as taking the\nextra steps to facilitate engagement, maintain family connections, provide needed services\nand supports despite limited resources, and set families up for success.โ  (Id. at 12.)  In\nRandolph County, โ[s]takeholder input was uniformly positive.โ  (Id. at 20.)  As stated\nabove, โ[s]takeholders consistently report that DHR is looking at permanency issues for\nchildren when they first come into care.โ  (Id.)  โStakeholders reported that caseworkers\nare doing a better job of engaging families and are asking the right questions when\nassessing families.โ  (Id.)  In Conecuh County, โ[i]ssues with permanency, stability, and\nvisitation by staff were reported to be satisfactory.โ  (Id.)  Stakeholders also โdescribed\nworkers as taking extra steps to engage families, [as] . . . maintaining family relationships,\nand [as] providing support and services that facilitate success for families.โ (Id. at 28.) \nAlso, โ[s]takeholders were generally positive about Marshall Countyโs efforts.โ  (Id.\nat 78.)  In the remaining counties, the court monitor did not recite any positive or negative\ncomments from stakeholders. \n130\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 131 of 148(cid:10)\n9.  The 2006 On-Site Sustainability Reviews:  The Three Counties\nWhich the Court Monitor Deemed Were Not\n in Substantial Compliance with the Consent Decree\na.  The Arguments of the Parties\nDefendant argues that the fact that three counties โ Macon, Marshall and Jefferson\nโ did not pass substantial compliance muster as a result of the 2006 on-site sustainability\nreviews does not mean that overall Defendant is not sustaining substantial compliance.  He\nargues that โ[t]here is nothing in the Consent Decree or the governing legal standards to\nsupport a conclusion that the inability of one or more non-party counties to maintain the\nstandards of the Decree for some period of time precludes the Commissioner from\ndemonstrating his own sustained compliance with his requirements under the Decree.โ \n(Doc. No. 811 at 9.)  Furthermore, Defendant states that, even in these three lagging\ncounties, the data reveals that children are in safe, stable and appropriate placements.  (Id.\nat 10.)  Defendant also stresses as relevant to the substantial compliance inquiry the fact\nthat DHR has in place procedures to identify and correct problems in individual counties. \nIn fact, he says that, prior to the court monitorโs 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, DHR\nalready had pinpointed the weaknesses noted by the court monitor in the non-compliant\ncounties and had initiated corrective action.  Defendant proffers that the court monitor\nwould concur with the latter statement, given the court monitorโs recent statement that\n131\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 132 of 148(cid:10)\nโDHR has demonstrated the ability to work with and correct problems when they are\nidentified in some counties, and this is particularly true in the small counties.โโ  (Id. (citing\nCt. Monitor April 2006 Report at 92 (Doc. No. 812).)\nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the deficiencies in Macon, Marshall and\nJefferson counties are many and great.  Further, Plaintiffs interpret the evidence as to the\nseven sustaining counties to include other substantial shortcomings which Plaintiffs\ncontend further magnify DHRโs alleged failure to demonstrate sustained substantial\ncompliance.  (Doc. No. 820 at 6-8.)\n  \nb.  DHR Has Detected Problems\nThe 2006 on-site sustainability reviews provide the basis for the courtโs finding that\nthe Consent Decree effectively has caused DHR to implement mechanisms and procedures\nwhich have given it the ability to detect and redress problems within individual counties. \nThis desired result is another factor which underlies the courtโs finding that DHR has\ndemonstrated that it will continue to comply with the Consent Decreeโs principles in the\nabsence of court supervision.  In other words, the court finds that the Consent Decree is no\nlonger necessary to ensure the effective functioning of DHR in the arena of child welfare. \nSee Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247; Kindred v. Duckworth, 9 F.3d 638, 644 (7th Cir. 1993)\n(โ[D]ecrees imposing obligations upon state institutions normally should be enforceable\n132\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 133 of 148(cid:10)\nno longer than the need for them.โ).  DHRโs success in the area of self-monitoring and\nself-correction also has not gone unnoticed by the court monitor. \nThe evidence establishes that DHR successfully is identifying weaknesses in child\nwelfare practices which affect a countyโs ability to sustain substantial compliance with the\nConsent Decree.  (See Doc. No. 811 at 10-11.)  For example, in his April 2006 Report, the\ncourt monitor reported that the major impediments to Macon Countyโs success are\nretention of staff (reflected by the turnover rates which exceeded 60 percent for each of\nthe three years preceding his review), limited in-county resources, and weak collaboration\nwith foster parents.  (Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 69 (Doc. No. 812).)  The court\nmonitor, however, was quick to point out that he was not the first to discover these\nweaknesses.  He says, โIt should be noted that DHR was already working on these\nperformance issues and that further action has been taken since the review.โ  (Id. at 70.) \nIndeed, in 2004, DHR identified management problems in Macon County.  After close\nmonitoring, in 2006, the county director was replaced with a management โteamโ\ncomprising a district administrative specialist and child welfare consultants.  (Slaughter\nAff. at 2 (Attach. 7 to Doc. No. 811).)  As a result, โ[i]mprovements are already being\nseen,โ and it is โanticipated that the county will make steady progress over the coming\nyear.โ  (Id.) \nTurning to Jefferson County, the court initially observes that it does not agree in\nwhole with Plaintiffsโ statement that Jefferson County โis the best single proxy for the\n133\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 134 of 148(cid:10)\nfunctioning of the state foster care system as a whole.โ  (Doc. No. 820 at 18.)  Jefferson\nCounty does not necessarily typify the state, or for that matter, any other county.  The\ncourt recognizes that Jefferson County comprises the county with the largest percentage of\nchildren in DHRโs care, as Plaintiffs point out, but that fact also is one which contributes\nto the uniqueness of the county.  Jefferson County always has been uniquely situated. \n(See, e.g. Dec. 13, 2004 Order (Doc. No. 725) (describing Jefferson county as having\nโunique needsโ).)  The court simply does not find that the deficiencies in Jefferson County\nare impediments to a finding of systemwide substantial compliance.  The court, however,\nalso makes abundantly clear that it would not so find if the evidence did not show in a\nvery concrete manner that DHR presently is taking great strides and directing a multitude\nof resources for the long-term betterment of Jefferson County.  The affidavits of Paul\nButler, Angela Tanveer and Susan Ward provide details of the recent work in progress in\nJefferson County.64  (See attachments 4-6 to Doc. No. 811.)  Below are some examples of\nthe steps being taken by DHR to improve leadership, services, the performance of ISPs,\nand the attainment of permanency for children in Jefferson County.  \n64 The court notes that Butler, at the time he signed his affidavit, served as the\ninterim director of DHRโs Children and Family Services.  In this capacity, he supervised\nthe director of Jefferson County DHR and worked with the county in all program areas,\nespecially child welfare.  (Butler Aff. at 2.)  Tanveer, as stated earlier in this opinion,\nsubmitted her affidavit in her capacity as the assistant director for child welfare in\nJefferson County DHR (Tanveer Aff. ยถ 2), and Ward signed her affidavit in her capacity\nas the director of the State DHR Office of Resource Management which โdeals with\ncontracting services for DHR, Statewide Licensing of Child Placing Agencies and Child\nCare Institutions, and statewide Resource Development and Utilization Review of\nresources used by DHR.โ  (Ward Aff. ยถ 2.)\n134\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 135 of 148(cid:10)\nIn an effort to improve child welfare practice, the State office has replaced the\nleadership of Jefferson County, bringing in a new child welfare administrator and an\ninterim county director.  (Doc. No. 811 at 11.)  The interim director immediately\nimplemented an across-the-board review of child welfare practice in the county.  (See\nButler Aff. at 3.)  \nContracts recently have been negotiated to increase the array of services\nspecifically targeted to prevent removal of children from their homes, to increase family\nreunification, to treat children who exhibit self-injurious behavior, and to promote ISP-\ndriven services.  (Ward Aff. at 1-3 (Attach. 5 to Doc. No. 811 at 1-3).)  A recruitment and\nretention specialist has been hired to research issues pertaining to staff retention.  (Tanveer\nAff. at 2.)  Monthly meetings are being held between the child welfare administrator and\nsupervisor to discuss, among other matters, practice issues, retention issues and\nsupervisory growth, and monthly professional development training sessions for the\nmanagement team have been put into place.  (Id.)  \nA State DHR consultant presently is reviewing all pending cases in Jefferson\nCounty, primarily to issue recommendations to workers and supervisors on safety issues. \n(Id. at 4.)  DHRโs quality assurance office is conducting a study on โnon-indicatedโ CANS\nto ascertain patterns and trends for purposes of improving performance, and management\nhas placed an emphasis on the timely reporting of CAN investigations.  (Id.); (see supra,\nfootnote 28.)  \n135\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 136 of 148(cid:10)\nManagement has identified the need to improve the quality of ISPs and assessments\nof families; thus, all five regions of Jefferson County received a two-day interactive\nworkshop focused on improving the ISP and assessment practice.  The improvement of\nISP practice also has been the focus of monthly meetings held with regional supervisors. \n(Id. at 4.)  Furthermore, the Jefferson County management team has identified the need to\nimprove the countyโs work in the timely achievement of permanency for children in foster\ncare and is taking steps for improvement in this area, as set out in Tanveerโs affidavit. \n(Id.)  As a final example, in August 2005, DHR identified serious performance issues in\nBessemer, one of the five regions of the Jefferson County DHR, and immediately an\ninvestigation commenced.  Ultimately, the regional manager of that division was removed. \n(Butler Aff. at 2.)  \nThe court finds that the evidence reveals that DHR continually is monitoring the\nstatus of child welfare in Jefferson County and earnestly is attempting to rectify the\npractice problems in this county.  The foregoing measures, which are representative and\nnot inclusive, demonstrate Defendantโs โgood faith commitment to the whole of the\ncourtโs orders and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the\npredicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.โ  Sims, 9 F. Supp.2d at 1287.\n136\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 137 of 148(cid:10)\n10.  Other Noteworthy Evidence\nWhen measuring substantial compliance in individual counties, the court monitor\nhas considered and placed an emphasis on any notable positive trends occurring within\ncounties.  (See, e.g., Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 4 (Doc. No. 812).)  The court finds\nthat, in the record, there is substantial evidence of positive trends of DHRโs performance,\nand the court has considered this evidence in reaching its finding that Defendant has\ndemonstrated that DHR will remain in substantial compliance.  The court finds that it is\nappropriate to set out some of these positive trends which also further amplify DHRโs\ngood faith commitment to providing child welfare care which complies with the core\npurposes of the Consent Decree.  For efficiency, the court addresses this evidence point-\nby-point, without elaborate transition.\nFirst, as discussed earlier in this opinion, but worth reiterating here, the court finds\nthat the ratings for the ten counties, which were included in the court monitorโs 2006 on-\nsite sustainability reviews, in the category of  โoverall child statusโ is a strong indicator\nthat, systemwide, children within DHRโs care are safe and doing well.  The โoverall child\nstatusโ rating for the children reviewed in these ten counties was 96 percent.  (Ct.\nMonitorโs April 2006 Report at 90, 92 (Doc. No. 812).)  \nSecond, as also discussed earlier in this opinion, the rating in the category of\nโoverall performanceโ shows marked improvement from the evidence which was before\nthe court when the court entered R.C. I.  (Compare the aggregate โoverall performanceโ\n137\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 138 of 148(cid:10)\nratings from the QSR reviews which were before the court in R.C. I, see 390 F. Supp.2d\nat 1050, with the results from the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews, see Ct. Monitor\nApril 2006 Report at 11, 18, 26, 34, 42, 51, 59, 67, 76, 86 (Doc. No. 812).)\nThird, and relatedly, DHR has provided two charts which compare the aggregate\nresults of the 2006 on-site sustainability reviews with the aggregate results from the fifteen\nQSR reviews set out in the court monitorโs November 2004 Report and discussed in\nR.C. I.  (Doc. No. 811 at 5-8); (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 31, 33); R.C. I, 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1050-51.  One chart compares the percentage of children who received an\nโacceptableโ rating in the categories used to determine the status of the child and family\n(see Doc. No. 811 at 8), while the other chart compares the percentage of children who\nreceived an โacceptableโ rating in the categories used to rate the performance of essential\nsystem functions for the child, see supra footnote 7.  (Doc. No. 811 at 7.)  The court\nagrees with DHR that the comparative charts reveal that the trends โare moving strongly in\na positive direction.โ  (Doc. No. 811 at 5.)  The charts impart that, in the categories used\nto evaluate system performance, the percentage of โacceptableโ cases is higher, in some\ncategories markedly higher, than the percentages in the same categories set out in the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report.  (See id. at 7.)  Moreover, with the exception of one\ncounty, the percentage of โacceptableโ cases is either equal to (within one percentage\npoint) or in excess of the percentages uncovered during the QSR reviews set out in the\ncourt monitorโs November 2004 Report.  (Id.) \n138\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 139 of 148(cid:10)\nFourth, in keeping with the discussion of the QSR reviews presented in the court\nmonitorโs November 2004 Report, see R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1048-51, the court finds\nthat DHRโs ability to detect and to restore compliance in backsliding counties is\ndemonstrated through Jackson County.  In 2004, Jackson County was one of the counties\nwith a 25 percent performance rating.  The court monitor noted that Jackson County, in\nparticular, exhibited โsignificant problems with practice performanceโ and had an average\nR.C. workload of 127 percent.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2004 Report at 16); R.C. I, 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1050 n.23; (see also Ct. Monitor April 2006 Report at 29 (Doc. No. 812).)  The\nresults of the 2006 on-site sustainability review, however, demonstrated substantial\ncompliance.  In his April 2006 Report, the court monitor declared that, although\npreviously Jackson County was โnot sustaining practice in accordance with the R.C.\nprinciples,โ it now is in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  (Ct. Monitor\nApril 2006 Report at 29, 36 (Doc. No. 812).)  The Jackson County DHR staff is deserving\nof praise for its ability to detect and correct the problems which prevented adequate\nperformance. \nFifth, the absence of discussion in this opinion with regard to DHRโs Child Welfare\nStrategic Plan should not be misinterpreted as a lack of consideration of the Plan in the\ncourtโs decision to terminate the Consent Decree.  (Doc. No. 714.)  In R.C. I, the court\ndiscussed this Plan, which DHR also refers to as its โsustainability plan,โ see 390 F.\nSupp.2d at 1038-39, and the court concurs with the court monitor that this Plan is a\nโstrengthโ of DHR.  (Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 27 (Doc. No. 783).)  Although the\n139\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 140 of 148(cid:10)\ncourt finds it unnecessary to repeat its discussion from R.C. I, it emphasizes that it finds\nthat the Plan is a concrete exemplification of DHRโs good-faith commitment to the whole\nof the Consent Decree.65  \nSixth, further demonstration that DHR has no plans to abandon any of the\nprinciples of the Consent Decree, after the Decreeโs termination, is evidenced by the fact\nthat DHR is โupdat[ing]โ its existing policy manual to โinstitutionalize [the] stand-alone\nRC policies within [DHRโs] policy manuals.โ  (Cantrell Dep. at 50-51 (Attach. K to Doc.\nNo. 779)); (Doc. No. 779 at 25.)  The updates include, among others, chapters addressing\nfamily focus practice, DHRโs work with families through the ISP Process, child and\nfamily safety and well being, service of children in out-of-home placements, adoption, in-\nhome services, and child abuse and neglect investigation.  (Cantrell Dep. at 50, 52-54);\n(Doc. No. 779 at 25.)\nSeventh, Defendant willingly has collaborated with the Governor of the State of\nAlabama and the court monitor on an executive order which will come into effect when\nthe Consent Decree is terminated.  (See Def. Aff. ยถ 6 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc.\nNo. 761).)  As stated in R.C. I, pursuant to this executive order, the Governor will appoint\n65 The Strategic Plan describes its intentions as follows:  โThe Department has\nmade outstanding improvements to practice, however, we do not wish to rest upon our\nlaurels, but choose instead to constantly strive for better performance.  We know that it is\nnecessary to be ever vigilant regarding progress made.  To that end, DHR presents an\norganizational plan for post RC that will be called the Child Welfare Strategic Plan.โ \n(Cantrell Dep. at 98, attached as Ex. 1 to Doc. No. 779); (see also Doc. No. 779 at 19\nn.8.)\n140\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 141 of 148(cid:10)\na child welfare commission to operate for a period of time for the purpose of overseeing\nDHRโs child welfare system.  See 390 F. Supp.2d at 1039 n.10.  The court again\ncommends the Governor of Alabama, Bob Riley, for his dedication to the State of\nAlabamaโs child welfare system and his steadfast commitment to ensuring that DHR\nmaintains a level of practice which equates substantial compliance when the Consent\nDecree is terminated.66\n  Eighth, it is worth reiterating that DHR has developed sophisticated automated\nsystems for purposes of assimilating information necessary to monitor and advance DHRโs\nsystem of care.  (See Dean Aff. ยถยถ 5-6 (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761)); (Bratcher Aff. at 4-5);\n(Johnson Aff. at 4); (Bonham Aff. at 2-4 (Ex. 11 to Doc. No. 761).)  The court monitorโs\nApril 2006 report reveals that DHR continually is improving its capability to collect and\nanalyze data for purposes of monitoring its child welfare system.  (See, e.g., supra,\nfootnote 41.)\nNinth, in his affidavit, Butler has submitted a compilation of the yearly ratings\ngiven for the fifty-one indicators of quality practice, as assessed during the state quality\nassurance reviews.67  (Butler Aff. at 5 (ยถ 12) (Ex. 2 to Doc. No. 825)); (Dean Aff. ยถ 9 (Ex.\n66 (See also Transcript from Oct. 31, 2000 status conference at 22, which was filed\nNov. 14, 2000, in which the Governorโs then legal counsel highlighted that Governor\nRiley stated โin his inaugural address that the children of Alabama were going to be his\nnumber one priorityโ and that the Governorโs โcommitment ha[s] not changedโ).)\n67 The fifty-one indicators are based upon the principles outlined in the Consent\nDecree.  Each indicator is rated either as a countyโs strength, an area needing\nimprovement or both.  Deanโs affidavit provides a description of how the fifty-one\n141\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 142 of 148(cid:10)\n2 to Doc. No. 761).)  The court finds that this data reveals that the average number of\nindicators rated as a โstrengthโ has been increasing over the past three years.  (See Butler\nAff. at 5.)  The collection of this data, which is amassed from every county each month on\nthe fifty-one indicators of practice, is one method which DHR has employed to measure\nsubstantial compliance with the Consent Decree.  (Doc. No. 761 at 14, 20, 23, 29); (see\nalso Dean Aff. (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761)); (see also Ex. 7 to Doc. No. 761, titled\nโSustainability Reviewsโ51 Indicator Summaryโ).)\nTenth, DHR is continuing to conduct QSR reviews to ascertain whether counties\nare complying with the Consent Decree.  As of August 2005, twenty-seven such reviews\nhave been conducted by DHR.  (See Doc. No. 761 at 2.)  In sum, the court finds that the\nforegoing factors indicate both positive trends and exemplify what the court finds to be\nDHRโs proven demonstration of good faith. \n11.  The End of Federal Judicial Supervision Does Not Mean the End of Oversight:\nDHRโs Quality Assurance System and Other Supervision Mechanisms\nMany of the measures discussed in the previous section demonstrate that the end of\ncourt oversight does not mean the end of oversight.  It was expected that DHR would\nestablish mechanisms which would allow it to monitor and promote compliance with the\nConsent Decree and, similarly, pinpoint and correct problems, which undoubtedly will\nindicators are used to measure a number of practice-specific and systemic performance\nissues for a county.  (Dean Aff. ยถ 9 (Ex. 17 to Doc. No. 761).) \n142\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 143 of 148(cid:10)\noccur in a department the size of DHR.  The court monitor has praised DHR for its\ndevelopment of effective mechanisms for monitoring its progress with respect to\ncompliance with the core purposes of the Consent Decree, and the court concurs with the\ncourt monitorโs assessment.  As stated by the court monitor, \nDHR deserves recognition for developing and implementing a QA [quality\nassurance] system that fulfills the expectations of the Consent Decree and\nImplementation Plan regarding quality assurance.  The QA system provides\na permanent structure for evaluating the level of practice and outcomes for\nchildren and families at both the state and county level.  The quality\nassurance system is one of the strengths of the agency, and an effective QA\nsystem is a critical component of an effective system of care. \n(Ct. Monitor Nov. 2005 Report at 27 (Doc. No. 783)); (see also Implementation Plan,\nQuality Assurance Plan (attached as exhibit to Doc. No. 275)); (Dean Aff. ยถยถ 7-11 (Ex.\n17 to Doc. No. 761) (discussing DHRโs multifaceted review mechanisms).)  \nNot only is a quality assurance (โQAโ) system in place, but the Child Welfare\nStrategic Plan also โincorporates ongoing QA mechanisms as one strategy to continue to\nmonitor and provide feedback to county child welfare operations.โ  (Id.)  For example,\nthe Child Welfare Strategic Plan ensures that counties receive formal review at least\nevery three years after termination of the Consent Decree.  (Doc. No. 761 at 23); (Def.\nAff. ยถ 20 (electronically filed as Ex. 5 to Doc. No. 761).)  DHRโs โreport cards,โ which\ndescribe the status of each countyโs performance with respect to the Consent Decree, also\nwill continue to be published on DHRโs website for the publicโs observance and scrutiny. \nSee R.C. I, 390 F. Supp.2d at 1041; (Doc. No. 761 at 24); (see also Dean Aff. ยถ 13 (Ex.\n17 to Doc. No. 761).)

CONCLUSION  \nThe Supreme Court of the United Statesโ decision in Lewis v. Casey provides the\nratio decedendi for the courtโs decision in this case today.  See 518 U.S. 343 (1996).  In\nLewis, the Supreme Court rejected a class action brought by state prisoners who alleged\nthat the state prisonsโ law library facilities were constitutionally substandard and thereby\ndeprived them of their right of access to courts.  See id.  Holding that the inmates failed\nto demonstrate actual injury, a prerequisite for establishing standing, the Supreme Court\nexplained that the doctrine of standing essentially is โa constitutional principle that\nprevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches.โ  Id.\nat 349 (citations omitted).  The Court reasoned:\n68 Again, the court recognizes that the reviews conducted by DHHS, which\nmonitors the child welfare programs of each state in the nation, are not a substitute for\nsubstantial compliance.  The court, however, concurs with Defendant that these reviews\nare โone of several levels of protection against a repeat of the conditions that existed\nwhen this suit was filedโ in 1988.  (Doc. No. 779 at 11-12); (see Doc. No. 767 at 11-12.)\nContinuing in the same vein, the court also notes that it read the recent authority cited by\nPlaintiffs.  See Frazar v. Ladd, 457 F.3d 432 (11th Cir. 2006); (Doc. No. 839.)  Although\nthe general legal principles concerning termination of consent decrees in institutional\nreform cases are applicable, the court finds that Frazarโs holding is not.  In Frazer, the\ndefendant argued, in part, that termination of consent decree was warranted because the\nentity had complied with the federal law.  Here, Defendant has never argued, as the\ndefendant did in Frazar, that compliance with federal law is a replacement for substantial\ncompliance with the provisions of the Consent Decree. \n144\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 145 of 148(cid:10)\nIt is the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class\nactions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not\nthe role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions\nof government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the\nConstitution.  In the context of the present case:  It is for the courts to\nremedy past or imminent official interference with individual inmates'\npresentation of claims to the courts; it is for the political branches of the\nState and Federal Governments to manage prisons in such fashion that\nofficial interference with the presentation of claims will not occur.  Of\ncourse, the two roles briefly and partially coincide when a court, in\ngranting relief against actual harm that has been suffered, or that will\nimminently be suffered, by a particular individual or class of individuals,\norders the alteration of an institutional organization or procedure that\ncauses the harm. \nId. at 349-50.  \nThe court finds, that, although it took much longer than originally contemplated by\nthe Consent Decree, the ratio decidendi of the holding in Lewis now is directly\napplicable to this case.  The class of children in DHRโs care whom the Consent Decree in\nthis case protects is no longer in imminent danger of harm due to the widespread\nconstitutional deficiencies which once plagued DHRโs child welfare system.69  The court\nfinds that the Consent Decree has served its useful and critical purpose in successfully\neffectuating the overhaul and reform of DHRโs child welfare system.  The deficiencies\nwhich caused the harm have been remedied, and the time has come for this court to\n69 The court notes that, although the Consent Decree contains a โdisclaimer of\nliabilityโ (i.e., that Defendant โdoes not acknowledge or admit that DHR is in any way in\nviolation of the U.S. Constitution or any federal statuteโ) (Consent Decree at 4),\nDefendant has conceded that litigation would have resulted in โa clear victory for the\nplaintiffsโ and exposed โdevastatingโ facts.  See R.C. v. Nachman, 969 F. Supp. 682, 686\n(M.D. Ala. 1997), affโd, 145 F.3d 363 (11th Cir. 1998).\n145\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 146 of 148(cid:10)\nrelease DHRโs child welfare system from federal judicial oversight and return it to the\ncomplete autonomy of the state.  \nBased on the totality of the evidence presented and DHRโs demonstrated good\nfaith compliance with regard to the operation of its child welfare system and the\nimplementation of the courtโs orders, the court finds that Defendant is operating and will\ncontinue to operate DHRโs child welfare system in a manner which complies with the\nlaws, the Consent Decree and the Implementation Plan.  The court further finds that it has\nnot been presented with any material reason to believe that DHR will revert to its pre-\nR.C. ways if court oversight ends.  In light of the evidence which the court finds equates\nsystemwide substantial compliance, the court finds that retention of judicial control is not\nnecessary or practical and that to accept Plaintiffsโ invitation to further delay termination\nof this Consent Decree would be tantamount to inviting the proverbial elephant into the\nparlor.  Cf. Reynolds v. McInnes, 338 F.3d 1201, 1217 (11th Cir. 2003) (Carnes, J.)\n(comparing the obstacles to cessation of a long-running consent decree to an elephant in\nthe parlor).\nThere admittedly are weaknesses in the system, as articulated herein.  The court,\nhowever, finds that the present shortcomings are shortcomings which are inherent in any\norganization of this type and size.  As recognized by another judge of this court, in\nreference to the Alabama Mental Health and Mental Retardation System, which at the\ntime was operating under a consent decree, โ[w]ithout question, close scrutiny of any\n146\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC     Document 849     Filed 01/16/2007     Page 147 of 148(cid:10)\nstate institution of the magnitude presented here will inevitably reveal numerous\ndeficiencies.โ  Wyatt, 985 F. Supp. at 1388.  โIt would be impractical, and thus\nunreasonable, to expect 100% compliance 100% of the time.โ  Id.  \nIn sum, as required for termination of the Consent Decree, the court finds that\nDefendant has demonstrated that โDHR is in substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the Decree and of the Implementation Plan and that DHR will remain in\nsubstantial compliance after termination of the injunction in this case.โ  (Consent Decree\nยถ 93 (Doc.

A magistrate judgeโs report and\nrecommendation is not final and appealable until judgment thereon is entered by a\ndistrict court judge. 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(c).\n(b)  In cases involving multiple parties or multiple claims, a judgment as to fewer than\nall parties or all claims is not a final, appealable decision unless the district court has\ncertified the judgment for immediate review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).

Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.\nRinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). In civil cases, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)\nand (c) set the following time limits:\n(a)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set\nforth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the\nentry of the order or judgment appealed from. However, if the United States or an\nofficer or agency thereof is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed in the district\ncourt within 60 days after such entry. THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND\nFILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF\nTHE APPEAL PERIOD โ no additional days are provided for mailing. Special\nfiling provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): โIf one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party\nmay file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was\nfiled, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period\nends later.โ\n(c)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in this rule, the time for\nappeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last\nsuch timely filed motion.\n(d)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district\ncourt may extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Under Rule 4(a)(5), the time may\nbe extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the\ntime otherwise provided to file a notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable\nneglect or good cause. Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district\ncourt finds upon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the\njudgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in\neither a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is timely if it is deposited in\nthe institutionโs internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. Timely filing\nmay be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 1746 or a notarized\nstatement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class\npostage has been prepaid.\n3.  Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, is a suitable format. See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c). A pro se notice of\nappeal must be signed by the appellant.\n4.  Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the\nfiling of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of appellate jurisdiction or to rule\non a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).",

We  commend  the \n \nClass, the State of Alabama and the district court on the \nhighly successful execution of this consent decree. \n \nFootnotes \n1  The Class argues that under Loyd v. Ala. Depโt of Corrs., 176 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir.1999), and Cason v. Seckinger, 231 F.3d 777 \n(11th Cir.2000), the district court had an obligation to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Both of these cases were decided under the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(b)(2)-(3) (2006). Both are factually and legally distinguishable and do not \nhold, as Appellants assert, that a district court must order an evidentiary hearing prior to the termination of any consent decree. In \nLoyd, the only evidence upon which the district court relied to make its determination was that submitted by the court monitor. \nLoyd, 176 F.3d at 1342 (noting that court monitor had submitted eleven reports to the court but not mentioning any evidence \nsubmitted by plaintiff who opposed termination). In Cason, in an even more problematic situation, the lower court โrefused to \nacceptโ evidence proffered by the class to demonstrate ongoing violations of federal law. Cason, 231 F.3d at 782. Here, the court \naccepted and considered all the evidence before it, including extensive proffers by the Class itself. \n \n2  The Class could have sought leave to depose additional individuals but failed to make such a request to the district court. \n \n3  In Docket number 828, the Class expressly acknowledged its understanding of the district courtโs May 8, 2006, order as stating that \nโthere will be no status conference or evidentiary hearing on this matter.โ Nevertheless, the Class interposed no objection. \n \n4  In its reply brief to, and at oral argument before, this Court, the Class asserted that its May 18, 2006, brief did generally refer to and \nincorporate its prior briefing, which, the Class asserts, did request an evidentiary hearing. Our review of that May 18, 2006, brief \nreveals that it did make a general reference to and incorporation of a previous brief in November, 2005 (Docket 781). We note, \nhowever, that Docket 781 did not request an evidentiary hearing. In any event, in light of the district courtโs express indication of \nan intent to rule without an evidentiary hearing, we readily conclude that the Class failed to fairly apprise the district court of any \nobjection to the district courtโs intention of ruling without an evidentiary hearing. \n \n5  The district court observed that throughout the litigation, โthe facts and data rarely have been in dispute, as the issues largely have \nfocused on whether those facts and data legally are sufficient to fulfill Defendantโs burden under the Consent Decree.โ R.C.

Monitor Ex. 1, at 1.)  \n2\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 725   Filed 12/13/04   Page 3 of 5\nThe court, though, finds that further negotiations are needed concerning alleged\ndeficiencies outlined in the court monitorโs report concerning DHRโs ability to\ndemonstrate that it will โremain in substantial compliance after termination of the\ninjunction in this case.โ2  (Consent Decree, June 11, 1991, ยถ 93, as amended by ยถ 10 of\nConsent Order Extending Time for Compliance and Granting Other Relief, Feb. 11,\n1999.)  At the status conference, the court outlined the following four alleged โproblem\nareasโ:  \n(1) DHR has not implemented into sanctioned DHR policy the 1998 court-ordered\nstaffing standards.   (See Ct. Monitor Ex. 1, at 55 (recommending that โDHR maintain the\n1998 Court Order of Caseloads and Staffing by implementing policy measures to ensure\ncurrent staff-to-caseload ratios are continuedโ).)\n(2) DHR never has complied with the courtโs November 4, 2003 Order which\ndirected DHR to establish a mechanism to provide regular โreport cardsโ describing the\nstatus of each countyโs performance with respect to the consent decree.  (See Nov. 4,\n2003 Order which provides:  โIn connection with DHRโs sustainability reviews of\nconverted counties, the Defendant will develop and implement a report card or similar\nmechanism for publicly asserting and rating the quality of each countyโs practice.โ). \n2  See generally Ct. Monitor Ex. 1 at 32-39, โSystem Performance Ratings for\nSustainability Reviewsโ; see also Ct. Monitor Ex. 1 at 11 (โ[T]here continues to be\nquantitative and qualitative data that show that the significant improvement of practice\nmade through the conversion process has not been consistently maintained in all of the\ncounties that have been declared converted.โ).\n3\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 725   Filed 12/13/04   Page 4 of 5\n(3) Despite significant progress, Jefferson County which has five regions and the\nlargest percentage of children in DHRโs care manifests certain weaknesses which impede\nits ability to sustain substantial compliance.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 717 at 11-13.) \n(4) The court monitor has not yet declared Baldwin County in substantial\ncompliance with the principles of the consent decree.  \n The parties agreed to meet and confer jointly with the court monitor to address the\nalleged problems areas.  It is, therefore, CONSIDERED and ORDERED that, on or\nbefore January 21, 2005,3 counsel for Defendant, counsel for Plaintiffs, and the court\nmonitor jointly confer and formulate a detailed written plan focused on strategies to\nrectify the alleged deficiencies outlined herein and file a joint statement as to these\nmatters.  Specifically, the joint statement shall include particulars regarding the\nfollowing:  (1) the inclusion of the 1998 court-ordered staffing standards in official DHR\npolicy; (2) a mutually agreed-upon report card or similar mechanism for publicly\nasserting and rating the quality of each countyโs practice4; (3) the particular compliance\nproblems with and the unique needs of Jefferson County and the specific methods DHR\n3 At the status conference, the court directed the parties to file their joint statement\nwithin thirty days.  The court has enlarged the deadline in light of the holiday season.\n4 Based on DHRโs eagerness to comply with the courtโs November 4, 2003 Order\nand to demonstrate within a more condensed time frame the countiesโ ability to sustain\nperformance, the court has not, as it suggested at the status conference, ordered a\ndefinitive time line for the release of the โreport cards.โ  The court envisions that the\nparties will be able to reach an agreement regarding a time frame, if any, for the courtโs\nreview of these โreport cards.โ \n4\n\nCase 2:88-cv-01170-ID-CSC   Document 725   Filed 12/13/04   Page 5 of 5\nwill implement to ensure adequate performance in the future in Jefferson County; and\n(4) a report as to the status of Baldwin County.\nAll other pending matters not specifically addressed herein are RESERVED.\n   DONE this 13th day of December, 2004.\n /s/ Ira DeMent                                                      \nSENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n5",
