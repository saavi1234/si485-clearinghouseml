Significantly, the majority \nwrote that: “DeFunis did not cast his suit as a class action, and the only remedy he requested was an injunction \ncommanding his admission to the Law School.

This  notice  shall,  to  the \nextent  possible,  be  combined  with  the  letter  (set  forth  in \nExhibit  A)  required by  Paragraph  10,  above. \n12.  HUD  hereby  commits  funding  authority  for  a  total  of  700 \nSection  8  Certificates  to  Buffalo  in its  capacity as  a  PHA,  which \nCertificates will  be  administered by  RAC,  and  a  total  of  100 \nSection  8  Certificates  to Amherst  in its  capacity as  a  PHA,  which \nCertificates  will  be  administered by  Belmont.  Belmont  shall \nissue  its  100  additional  Certificates  within  one  year  after  the \nCHC  begins  operation  (as  defined  in Subparagraph  1(b),  above), \nand  RAC  shall  issue  its  700  additional  Certificates  within  three \nyears  after the  CHC  begins  operation. \n13.  HUD  agrees  that  the  minimum'size  of  RAC's  and  Belmont's \nfamily  self-sufficiency programs  shall  not  be  increased as  a \nresult  of  the  800  Certificates  referred  in  Paragraph  12,  above. \nHUD  also agrees  that  if Buffalo  or Amherst  apply  to  HUD  for  any \nincremental  funding  for  Section  8  subsidies  at  any  time  before \ntheir entire portion of  the  800  additional  Certificates are \n11 \n\nissued,  HUD  shall  take  into account  the  effect  of  these \nadditional  Certificates  in evaluating  the  lease-up  rate  for  that \nprogram. \n14.  Within  30  days  after the  CHC  begins  operation,  RAC  shall \nissue  one  of  Buffalo's  700  additional  Certificates  to each  named \nplaintiff and  putative  intervenor who  is eligible  for  the  Section \n8  tenant-based program,  following  all procedures  applicable  to \nthe  processing  of  special  applicants. \n15.  Commencing  when  the  CHC  begins  operation,  and  ending \nwhen  the  special  waiting  list is discontinued,  pursuant  to \nParagraph 26,  below,  RAC  and  Belmont  shall  issue  their portion of \nthese  800  Certificates  (both  initially and  as  turnovers)  only  to \nspecial  applicants  still residing  in Buffalo who  verify their \nfederal  preference  claim.  After  the  special  waiting  list is \ndiscontinued pursuant  to  Paragraph  26,  below,  RAC  and  Belmont \nshall  treat  any  turnovers  from  their.portion of  the  800 \nCertificates as  part  of  their  regular  supply  of  Certificates, \nwith no  limits  from  this  Consent  Decree  as  to whom  they may  be \nissued. \n16.  Commencing  when  the  CHC  Qegins  operation,  and  ending \nwhen  the  special  waiting  list is discontinued  pursuant  to \nParagraph 26,  below: \n(a)  Three-quarters  of  all  of  the  Consortium's  regular \nsubsidies  issued by  Belmont  each month  -- both  from  funding \navailable as  a  result  of  turnovers,  and  from  any  new  incremental \nallocations  of  funding  -- shall  be  limited to  special  applicants \n• \n12 \n\nstill residing  in Buffalo who  verify  their claim of  federal \npreference.  During  this entire period of  time,  Belmont  shall \nhave  the  right  to  issue  the  remaining  one-quarter of  these \nsubsidies  to  applicants  on  its waiting  list who  reside  or work  or \nwho  have  been  hired  to work  in any  of  the  participating \ncommunities  of  the  Consortium.  However,  after all special \napplicants  have  been processed,  or  three  and  one-half  years  after \nthe  CHC  begins  operation  -- whichever  occurs  first  -- this \ndivision  of  the  Consortium's  subsidies  shall  be  deemed  modified \nfrom  three-quarters  and  one-quarter  to  half  and  half,  pursuant  to \nSubparagraph  43(b),  below. \n(b)  Every  six months,  Belmont  shall  determine  if it in \nfact  issued  the  requisite portion of  the  Consortium's  regular \nsubsidies  to  special  applicants  during  that  six-month period,  and \nmake  any  necessary adjustments  during  the  next  six-month period \nto  compensate  for  having  issued  too many  or too  few  subsidies  to \nspecial  applicants  during  the  prior six-month  period. \n(c)  All  but  three  of  Buffalo's  regular subsidies  issued \n• \nby  RAC  each month  -- both  from  funding  available as  a  result  of \nturnovers,  and  from  any  new  incre~ental allocations  of  funding, \nbut  excluding  any  funding  received  from  settlement  of  Comer  v. \nCisneros  [BMHAJ  -- shall  be  limited to  special  applicants  still \nresiding  in Buffalo who  verify  their claim of  federal  preference. \nDuring  this  entire period of  time,  RAC  shall  have  the  right  to \nissue ·up  to  three  of  these  subsidies per month  to non-special : \napplicants. \n~3 \n\n(d)  In addition,  at all periods  of  time,  Belmont  and \nRAC  shall  have  the  right  to  issue  to qualifying applicants  not  on \nthe  special  waiting  list an  unlimited  number  of  all subsidies \nspecially designated  for  the  following  programs:  (i)  VASH;  (ii) \nHomelessness;  (iii)  HOPE  for  Elderly  Independence;  (iv)  continued \nassistance  for previously assisted families;  (v)  project-based \nCertificate;  (vi)  Family Unification;  and  (vii)  and  any  other \naward  that  HUD  sets  aside  for  particular uses. \n17.  Belmont  and  RAC  shall  issue  special  applicants  still \nresiding  in Buffalo who  verify their claim of  federal  preference \nwhatever  becomes  available  first  from  among  one  of  their portion \nof  the  800  Certificates,  a  turnover,  or a  subsidy  from  any  new \nincremental  funding  allocation,  as  provided  for  in Paragraphs  15 \nand  16,  above. \n18.  Belmont  and  RAC  generally shall  call  in special \napplicants  off  the  special waiting  list in chronological  order \nfor  processing,  but may  call  in groups  of  applicants  off  the \nwaiting  list together.  Belmont  and  RAC  shall  issue  a  subsidy \nonce  processing  of  an  applicant  is  completed,  even  if processing \nof  applicants  with  earlier applic~tion dates  has  not  been \ncompleted. \n19.  Belmont  and  RAC  shall  both  remove  from  all their waiting \nlists  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  special  waiting  list) \nall special  applicants  who  do  not  respond  within  30  days  to a \nnotice  from  Belmont  or RAC  calling  them  in off  the  special \nwaiting  list for processing.  However,  special  applicants  who  had \n• \n14 \n\nbeen  reinstated on  Belmont's  waiting  list pursuant  to  Paragraph \n8,  above,  and  who  are  sent  such  a  notice  during  the  first year \nafter the  CHC  begins  operation,  shall  have  until  one  year after \nthe  date  of  the  notice  to  respond  to Belmont. \n20.  To  the  extent  reasonably practicable,  Belmont  and  RAC \nshall  not  both  call  in the  same  special  applicant  off  the  special \nwaiting  list,  so  that  no  such  applicant  receives  an  offer from \n-\nboth Belmont  and  RAC.  Belmont  and  RAC  shall  both  remove  from  all \ntheir waiting  lists  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  special \nwaiting  list)  all  special  applicants  who  are  offered a  subsidy \nfrom  either Belmont  or RAC,  with  the  following  exceptions:  ,(a) \nthe  applicant  refused  the  offer of  a  Certificate  in order  to  wait \nfor  a  Voucher,  or refused  the  offer of  a  Voucher  to wait  for  a \nCertificate,  pursuant  to  24  C.F.R.  §§  982.204(c) (1)  and \n982.205(c) (2);  or  (b)  the  applicant  refused  the  offer of  a \nSpecial  Opportunity  Certificate or  chose  not  to  use  a  Special \nOpportunity  Certificate already  issued,  but  before  its \nexpiration,  pursuant  to  Subparagraph  35(c),  below  (and  so  info;ms \nRAC). \n21.  To  be  eligible  for  a  sub~idy,  all  special  applicants,  at \nthe  time  they  are  called  in off  the  special  waiting  list for \nprocessing,  must  verify current  federal  preference  status \npursuant  to  the  standards  and  procedures  set  forth  in HUD's \nregulations,  24  C.F.R.  §§  5.410-.430  (1996),  and  in Paragraphs  22 \nand  23,  below,  irrespective  of  whether  such preferences  are \nmandated  by  Congress.  ., \n15 \n\n22.  Until  such  time  as  the  special  waiting  list is \ndiscontinued pursuant  to  Paragraph  26,  below,  if admission  of  a \nclass member  applicant  is  subject  to  federal  preference \nrequirements  (either by  Congress  or  through  this  Consent  Decree) \nand  such applicant  currently resides  in BMHA  housing  and  was  on \nBelmont's  or RAC's  waiting  list when  admitted  to .BMHA  housing  on \nor after November  28,  1990,  the  applicant's  qualification for  a \nfederal  preference  shall  be  determined by  whether  the applicant \nwas  admitted  to BMHA  as  a  federal  preference  holder. \n23.  All  applicants  to  Belmont  or RAC  whose  admission  is \nsubject  to  federal  preference  requirements  (either by  Congress  or \nthrough  this  Consent  Decree) ,  and  who  are  currently living  in \npublic  housing,  shall  continue  to ha~e the  same  opportunity as \nany  other applicant  to present  information and/or  evidence \nsupporting  a  claim of  federal  preference,  and  Belmont  and  RAC \nshall  continue  to apply  to all applicants  the  same  procedures  and \nsubstantive  standards  for verifying  the  applicant's  eligibility \nfor  a  federal  preference.  Belmont  shall  use  the  provisions  of, \nand  exhibits  to,  the  Stipulation of  Settlement  in Thomas  v.  Kemp, \nNo.  92-CIV-00106  (W.D.N.Y.)  as  a  ~eneral model  for  implementation \nof  this  Paragraph 23. \n24.  Belmont  and  RAC  shall  remove  from  the  special  waiting \nlist,  and  reinstate  on  the  appropriate  portions  of  Belmont's  or \nRAC's  regular waiting  lists,  according  to  the  date  of  their \noriginal  application to Belmont  or RAC,  all special \napplicant~ \nwho,  when  they  are processed,  cannot  verify their claim of \n• \n16 \n\nfederal  preference pursuant  to  Paragraph  21,  or  do  not  then meet \nthe  other  criteria set  forth  above  in  Paragraph  6  for  special \napplicants.  However,  special  applicants  removed  from  the  special \nwaiting  list for  failure  to  verify  federal  preference  status \nshall  be  placed  on  the  supplemental  waiting  list developed \npursuant  to  Paragraph  40,  below,  according  to  their original  date \nof  application,  at  such  future  time  as  they  submit  to  Belmont  or \nRAC,  as  appropriate,  a  revised  application  claiming  current \nfederal  preference  status. \n25.  Nothing  in  this  Consent  Decree  alters  the  statutory and \nregulatory  criteria for  eligibility to  participate  in  the  Section \n8  tenant-based program.  Subject  to  24  C.F.R.  §  982.201(f), \nBelmont  and  RAC  may  remove  from  all  their waiting  lists \n(including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  special  waiting  list)  all \nspecial  applicants  who  do  not  meet  these  criteria at  the  time \nthey  are  processed. \n26.  The  special  waiting  list shall  be  discontinued  when  (a) \nall  special  applicants  have  been processed,  or  (b)  three  and  one-\n. \nhalf  years  after  the  CHC  begins  operation  -- whichever  occurs \nfirst.  However,  if any  special  applicants  have  not  been \nprocessed within  three  and  one-half  years  after  the  CHC  begins \noperation,  RAC  and  Belmont  shall  continue  using  the  special \nwaiting  list for  a  period  of  up  to  one  year.  If any  special \napplicants  have  not  been  processed within  four  and  one-half  years \nafter the  CHC  begins  operation,  they  shall  be  reinstated on  the \nappropriate  portion of  the .~aiting list of  the  program  to which \n17 \n\nthey  had  applied,  according  to  their original  date  of  application \nto  that  program. \n27.  HUD  shall  conduct  a  study of  rents  in Erie  County  to \ndetermine  whether,  under  the  substantive  standards  for \nestablishment  of  exception  rent  areas,  24  C.F.R.  §§  882.106(a) (3) \nand  887.35l(b) (2)  as  set  forth  in HUD's  regulations,  any  such \nexception  rent  areas  should be  established  in Erie  County,  and  if \nso,  what  the precise boundaries .. of  any  such  exception rent  areas \nshould be  and  what  specific percentage  of  rent  in excess  of  the \napplicable  Fair Market  Rents  (\"FMR.s\")  should apply  to  such areas. \nHUD  retains  the  final  authority and  discretion  to make  the \ndeterminations  in this  study~  Amherst/Belmont  and  Buffalo/RAC \nshall  take  the  necessary  steps  under  HUD's  regulations  to  obtain \nany  necessary  approvals  to  implernent·exception  rent  levels  in \nexcess  of  the  FMR.s  for  the maximum  percentage,  if any,  of  each \nPHA's  total  number  of  subsidies  allowed by  HUD's  regulations, \nconsistent  with  the  determinations  by  HUD  set  forth  in the  study \nrequired by  this  Paragraph  27.  This  study  shall  not  serve  to \nextend  the  time  periods  in this  Consent  Decree;  however,  special \napplicants  offered a  subsidy  can fhoose  to have  issuance  of  such \nsubsidy deferred until  such  time  as  the  study  is  completed. \n28.  Buffalo  shall  be  responsible  for  the  establishment  of  a \nCommunity  Housing  Center  (\"CHC\"),  which  shall  provide mobility \ncounseling  services  to  the  special  applicants  to  whom  either \nBelmon_t  or RAC  issue  subsidies,  designed  to encourage  and  assist \nthem  in renting  units  in non-impacted areas,  in accordance  with \n... \n18 \n\nthe  functions  and  activities  set  forth  in  the  final  Request  for \nProposal  (\"RFP\"),  set  forth  in draft  form  in Exhibit  C. \n29.  The  CHC  shall  develop  and  implement  a  strategy, \nincluding undertaking  the  following  outreach  efforts,  designed  to \nattract and  encourage  more  landlords  in non-impacted  areas  in \nErie  County  including within Buffalo  itself  -- to  participate \nin the  Section  8  tenant-based  programs  and  rent  units  to  class \nmembers:  (i)  presentations  to  real  estate,  management  and  owner \nassociations,  (ii)  local  advertisements,  (iii)  newsletter \nannouncements,  and  (iv)  general  mailings. \n30.  The  CHC  shall  be  operated by  the  non-profit \norganization(s)  selected by  Buffalo  and  approved  by  HUD,  based \nupon  competitive bids  submitted  to Buffalo  in  response  to  the \nRFP,  set  forth  in draft  form  in Exhibit  C,· in accordance  with  the \nfollowing  procedures: \n(a)  Within  7  days  after the  entry  of  an  Order by  the  Court \nsubstantially  in  the  form  appended  hereto  as  Exhibit  E,  all \nparties  shall  transmit  their  comments,  if any,  in writing  to  HqD \nregarding  the  draft  RFP  set  forth  in·Exhibit  C.  HUD  shall \nconsider any  such  comments  and,  w\\thin  21  days  after HUD  receives \nall  comments,  make  such  changes  to  the  draft  RFP  as  HUD  deems \nappropriate.  The  final  RFP  shall  then be  filed with  the  Court  to \nbe  attached  to  this  Consent  Decree  as  Exhibit  C  in place  of  the \ndraft RFP,  before  or after the  entry of  Final  Judgment. \n(b)  Upon  HUD's  provision  to Buffalo  of  a  final  RFP, \nBuffalo,  at  its own  shall  issue  the  RFP  by  causing  the \nexpense~ \n19 \n\nfollowing  notice:  (a)  one  time  in the  Commerce  Business  Daily, \n(b)  three  times  in The  Buffalo News,  (c)  one  time  in The \nChallenger,  and  (d)  letters  to  the  non-profit  organizations  on  a \nlist to be  provided by  HUD. \n(c)  Within  7  days  after the  closing date  for  submitting \napplications  to Buffalo  in response  to  the  RFP  for  the  CHC, \nBuffalo  shall  provide  to  counsel  for  HUD  and  plaintiffs a  copy  of \neach application submitted.  Within  21  days  after such  closing \ndate,  plaintiffs shall  provide  to  counsel  for  Buffalo  and  HUD,  in \nwriting,  any  comments  plaintiffs may  have  regarding  the \napplicants. \n(d)  Within  40  days  after the  closing date  for  submitting \napplications  to Buffalo  in response  eo  the  RFP  for  the  CHC, \nBuffalo shall  select  the  organization(s)  to  operate  the  CHC,  and \nso  notify counsel  for  HUD  and  plaintiffs  in writing.  Within  70 \ndays  after such  closing date,  HUD  shall  notify  counsel  for \nBuffalo and  plaintiffs  in writing whether  HUD  approves  the \norganization(s)  selected.  If HUD  does  not  approve  the \norganization(s)  selected by  Buffalo,  HUD  shall  include  in the \nnotification an  explanation  to  Buffalo  for  its decision,  and, \n~ \nwithin  7  days  after receiving  that  explanation,  Buffalo  shall \nselect another  organization in accordance  with  that  explanation. \n(e)  If HUD,  at any  point  in this process  prior to providing \nits approval  of  the  organization(s)  selected by  Buffalo, \ndetermines  that  none  of  the  applicants  are  qualified to  operate \nthe  CHC,  HUD  shall  so notify counsel  for  Buffalo  and  plaintiffs \n• \n20 \n\nin writing,  and  then provide  a  draft  revised RFP  to  counsel  for \nBuffalo  and  plaintiffs,  who  shall  transmit  any  comments,  in \nwriting,  to HUD  within 10  days  after receipt  of  the  draft  revised \nRFP.  HUD  shall  consider any  such  comments,  and,  within 21  days \nafter HUD  receives  both sets of  comments,  make  such  changes  to \nthe  draft  RFP  as  HUD  deems  appropriate.  Upon  HUD's  provision to \nBuffalo  of  the  final  version of  the  revised RFP,  Buffalo  shall \nissue  the  revised RFP  and  the procedures  set  forth  in \nSubparagraphs  30(b)-(d)  shall be  repeated. \n(f)  Buffalo  shall  notify  counsel  for  the  parties  in writing \nonce  the  contract  for  the  CHC  has  been awarded.  After \nconsultation with  the  CHC,  Buffalo  shall  notify  counsel  for  the \nparties  in writing at least  60  days  prior to when  the  CHC  intends \nto begin operation,  specifying  such  date  in the  notice. \n31.  No  party,  including Buffalo or HUD,  shall be  the \nguarantor  of  the performance  of  the  CHC,  although  no  party shall \nthwart  the  CHC's  exercise  of  its functions.  Buffalo's  contract \nwith  the  organization(s)  operating  tne  CHC  shall  set  forth \nspecific procedures  to apply  if either Buffalo,  HUD,  or \nplaintiffs believe  that  the  perfo4ffiance  of  the  CHC  is  inadequate, \nso  that  such  concerns  can be  reasonably  considered and  resolved. \nThe  contract  shall  further  include procedures  for  termination  of \nBuffalo's  contract with  the  CHC  if Buffalo,  after consultation \nwith HUD,  concludes .that  the  organizations(s)  operating  the  CHC \ncannot-make  sufficient  changes  to  resolve  such  concerns.  · \nHowever,  these  procedures  are  not  intended to  restrict or replace \n• \n21 \n\nany  rights  a  party has  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure \nto  enforce  the  Final  Judgment  with  respect  to  any  other party or \nnon-party.  If  the  contract  is  ter.minated  in accord with  the \napplicable  procedures  in  the  contract,  th~ procedures  set  forth \nin Paragraph  30,  above,  shall  be  followed  to  prepare  and  issue  a \nnew  RFP  and  select  a  new  organization  to  operate  the  CHC. \nSpecial  applicants  to whom  either Belmont  or RAC  issue  subsidies \nare  third party beneficiaries  of  the  contract  between  the  City  of \nBuffalo  and  the  CHC  solely with  respect  to  those  obligations  of \nthe  CHC  for  which  Buffalo  is  not  the  guarantor. \n32.  HUD  hereby  commits  $  2.2  million  in  funding  authority  to \nBuffalo  in  its capacity as  a  PHA  for  operation  of  the  CHC \npursuant  to  this  Consent  Decree.  HUD  shall  not  execute  the \nAmendment  to  the  Annual  Contributions  Contract  for  this  funding \nuntil  it has  approved  the  non-profit  organization(s)  to  operate \nthe  CHC.  If  these  funds  are  not  sufficient  to provide mobility \ncounseling  services  and  the  other activities  of  the  CHC  for  the \nentire  time  until  the  supplemental  waiting  list is discontinued \npursuant  to  Paragraph  44,  below,  no  defendant  shall  be  expected \nor  required  to provide  any  additfonal  funding.  If any  funds \nremain  after such  time  as  the  supplemental  waiting  list is \ndiscontinued pursuant  to  Paragraph  44,  below,  such  funds  shall  be \nused  for  the  provision of  mobility  counseling  services  by  the  CHC \nto  any  RAC  or  Belmont  applicant  issued  a  subsidy. \n33.  RAC  and  Belmont  shall  automatically grant  a  request .for \na  60-day  extension  of  the  ~nitial 60-day  term  of  a  subsidy  issued \n22 \n\nto  a  special  applicant.  Thus,  special  applicants  who  are  issued \na  subsidy  from  RAC  or Belmont  shall  have  a  maximum  of  120  days \nfrom  the  date  the  subsidy  is  issued  to  submit  a  request  for  lease \napproval  before  the  subsidy  expires  and  must  be  turned  in  for \nissuance  to  another  applicant.  However,  RAC  and  Belmont  may \ngrant  one,  and  only  one,  additional  30-day  extension  of  the \nsubsidy  to  special  applicants  who  do  not  submit  a  request  for \nlease  approval  within  that  120-day period  if  the  applicant's \nmobility  counselor  from  the  CHC  certifies  in writing,  prior  to \nthe  end  of  the  120-day  period,  that  the  applicant  needs  the \nadditional  time  and  has  not  been  dilatory  in  looking  for  housing. \n34.  Buffalo  and  Amherst  agree,  pursuant  to  the  authority  in \n24  C.F.R.  §  982.353(c) (3)  (1996),  that  applicants  whose  domicile \nwas  in Buffalo  at  the  time  of  application who  are  issued a \nsubsidy by  Belmont  may  also  choose  to  rent  a  unit  located  in \nBuffalo,  even  during  the  first  twelve  months,  and  that  applicants \nwhose  legal  domicile  was  in  one  of  the  members  of  the  Consortium \nat  the  time  of  application who  are  issued a  subsidy  by  RAC  may \nalso  choose  to  rent  a  unit  located  in  one  of  the  members  of  the \nConsortium,  even  during  the  firs~ twelve  months.  The  normal \nportability procedures  in 24  C.F.R.  §§  982.353- .355  shall  then \napply. \n35.

As  soon as  is practicable after the  entry  of  Final \nJudgment  pursuant  to  this  Consent  Decree,  HUD  shall  pay  to \nplaintiffs  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  and  costs  in the  amount  of \n$  550,000  in  full  and  final  settlement  of  any  and  all  claims  in \nthe  RAC  and  Belmont  actions  for  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  or \ncosts,  pursuant  to  any  statute  or other basis  for  services  that \nhave  been  performed  or  that  will  be  performed  in  the  future  in \nconnection with  these  two  Complaints  or  in any  administrative  or \ncourt  proceeding  arising under  or  relating  to  these  Complaints. \nAny  other  claims  for  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  or  costs  by  any \nplaintiff  or  plaintiffs  or by  any  counsel  for  any  plaintiff  or \nplaintiffs,  against  any  defendant,  shall  be  forever  barred, \nprovided,  however,  that  plaintiffs do  not  waive  any  right  they \nmight  have  to  attorney's  fees  wi•h  respect  to  future  enforcement \nproceedings  in connection  with  the  Consent  Decree.  However, \nplaintiffs will  not  be  entitled to  an  award  of  enforcement \nrelated attorney's  fees  unless  plaintiffs  show  that  defendants \nwere  in  contempt  of  the  Consent  Decree,  and  that  the  contempt  was \nwillful.  Nothing  in  this  Consent  Decree  will  prevent  any \ndefendant  from  applying  to  the  Court  for  attorney's  fees,  as \n+ \n39 \n\nappropriate,  with  respect  to any  enforcement  proceeding brought \nby plaintiffs. \n60.  The  Releasees  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  52)  are  released \nfrom  any  additional  liability for  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  or \ncosts  based  on  any  and  all  claims  and  causes  of  action which  have \nbeen,  could have  been,  or will  be  asserted  in  the  RAC  and  Belmont \nComplaints  by  reason  of,  or with  respect  to,  any  of  the  matters \nalleged  in  these  two  Complaints;  which  the  Releasers  (as  defined \nin  Paragraph  52)  had,  now  have,  or may  subsequently  have  against \nthe  Releasees,  including,  without  limitation,  any  and  all  claims \nfor  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  or  costs  for  services  that may  be \nperformed  in  the  future  in  connection  with  the  RAC  and  Belmont \nComplaints  or  in any  administrative  or  court  proceeding arising \nunder  or  relating  to  these  two  Complaints,  provided,  however, \nthat  plaintiffs do  not  waive  any  right  they might  have  to \nattorney's  fees  with  respect  to  future  enforcement  proceedings  in \nconnection with  the  Consent  Decree.  However,  plaintiffs will  not \nbe  entitled to  an  award  of  enforcement-related attorney's  fees \nunless  plaintiffs  show  that  defendants  were  in  contempt  of  the \nConsent  Decree,  and  that  the  contempt  was  willful. \n61.  The  provision  for  attorney's  fees,  costs,  and  expenses \nin  this  Consent  Decree  is not  a  finding  that  the  position of  any \nof  the  defendants  in  the  RAC  and  Belmont  Complaints  or  in \nconnection with  the  matters  to which  these  two  Complaints  relate \nwas  riot  substantially  justified or  that  the  defendants  are  liable \nas  a  matter  of  law  for  the•  payment  of  any  attorney's  fees, \n40 \n\nexpenses,  or  costs.  This  Consent  Decree  is not  and  shall  not  be \nconstrued as  an  admission  by  the  defendants  of  the  truth of  any \nallegation or  the validity of  any  claim asserted  in this action \nor  of  the  defendants'  liability therein,  nor  are  they a \nconcession  or an  admission  of  any  fault  or omission  in any  act  or \nfailure  to  act,  or  in any  statement,  written document,  or  report \nheretofore  issued,  filed  or made  by  any  defendant,  nor  shall  this \nConsent  Decree  nor  any  papers  related hereto,  nor  any  of  the \nterms  hereof  be  offered or  received  in evidence  or  in any  way \nreferred  to  in any  civil,  criminal,  or administrative action  or \nproceeding  with  than  such  proceedings  as  may  be  necessary  to \nconsummate  or enforce  this  Consent  Decree,  nor  shall  they be \nconstrued by  anyone  for  any  purpose  whatsoever  as  an  admission  or \npresumption  of  any wrongdoing  on  the  part  of  the  defendants.  The \nprovision of  attorney's  fees,  expenses,  and  costs  in this  Consent \nDecree  is by  agreement  of  the  parties  and  shall  not  serve  as \nprecedent  in,  or be  referred  to  in,  any  other  case. \n62.  Because  of  the  large  number  of  the members  of  the  class, \n• \npayment  of  the  $  550,000  as  set  forth  in  Paragraph  59,  above, \nshall  be  made  directly to GREATER UPSTATE  LAW  PROJECT,  INC.,  as \n4\nlead  counsel  for  the plaintiffs,  at  the  address  set  forth  below. \n63.

Please  read  it \ncarefully,  it may  help  you  get  Section  8  sooner  than you  thought. \nA recent  settlement  in  the  Comer  v.

To  be  eligible  for  a  Section  8  subsidy, \nyou  must  claim and verify a  \"federal  preference\".  A  federal \npreference means  that you  live  in substandard housing,  you  pay \nmore  than half your  income  for  rent  and utilities,  or you  are \ninvoluntarily displaced  (the  enclosed  sheet provides  more \ninformation) .  Federal  preference  applicants  must  be  given \nSection  8  assistance  before  those  who  do  not  have  a  federal \npreference. \nAccording  to  our  records,  you  did not  claim a  federal  preference \nat  the  time  you  applied  to  the  Section  8  Program.  If you  qualify \nfor  one  now,  you  should  submit  a  revised application  (also \nenclosed). \nYou  may  mail  or bring  the  application  to  470  Franklin Street,• \nBuffalo,  NY  14202.  You  will  keep  your  original  date  and  time  of \napplication  because  you  are  updating  the  information,  not  re \napplying  for  the program.

SCOPE  OF  WORK \nA.  Background \n[PILL  IN  HISTORY  OF  LITIGATION  AND \nDESCRIPTION  OF  WHO  RAC  AND.BELMONT  REPRESENT \nWHAT  COMMUNITIES  ARE  INCL'ODED  IN  BELMONT] \n~  Section  a  Conse~t Decree \n3 \n\nAs  part  of  the  settlement,  certain applicants  to  the  Section \n8  tenant-based programs  of  RAC  and  Belmont  will  be  identified as \n\"special  applicants.\"  Certain other applicants  to RAC  and \nBelmont  will  be  identified as  applicants  on  the  supplemental \nwaiting  list.  Special  applicants,  and  then  applicants  on  the \nsupplemental  waiting  list,  will  receive  priority for most  of \nRAC's  and Belmont's  Section  8  tenant-based assistance,  and \neligibility for  the mobility  counseling  services  offered by  the \nCHC.  HUD  will  be  also providing  BOO  Section  8  certificates \nthrough RAC  and  Belmont  for  these  applicants. \nEighty  Section  8  recipients  will  be  eligible  for  use  of \nSpecial  Opportunity  Certificates  (SOCs)  which  require  that  the \nholder move  to  a  non-impacted  area,  or  relinquish  the \ncertificate.  These  certificates will  be  redistributed  for  the \nsame  purpose,  if not  used by  the  fir~t recipient.  The  SOCs  will \nbe  the  first  certificates  issued under  this  program.  The \nremaining  720  certificates give  the  holders  the  right  to  receive \ncounseling,  if they  choose,  but  there  are  no  restrictions  on \nwhere  the  certificate  is used. \nEligibility for  placement  on  the  special  and  supplemental \nwaiting  lists,  and  then  issuance  of  Section  8  tenant-based \nassistance,  is determined under  the  terms  of  the  Consent  Decree. \nRAC  or Belmont  will  call  in eligible applicants  off  these  waiting \nlists,  perform eligibility determinations,  and  issue  certificates \nand vouchers  in order of  application and  in accordance  with the \nterms  of  the  Consent  Decree.  CHC  is not  involved  in this \nprocess.  CHC's  involvement  with a  recipient  of  a  certificate \nbegins  with  the  Section  8  orientation after the  recipients  are \nselected.  The  special  certificates are  subject  to  the  usual \nterms  of  Section  8  tenant-based assistance,  except  for  the \n\"Special  Opportunity  Certificates\"  which must  be  used  in non \nimpacted  areas.  The  certificate will  initially be  issued  for  60 \ndays,  but  RAC  or Belmont  will  automatically  extend  it,  upon \nrequest.  If  the  special  applicant  has  not  requested  lease \napproval  within 120  days,  the  certificate may  be  extended  for  an \nadditional  thirty days  to  a  total  of  150  days,  if CHC  certifies \nin writing  that  the  recipient  has4 nof  been dilatory  in  their \nsearch  for  housing.  RAC  and  Belmont  are  responsible  for \ninspecting  units  and  approving  leases. \nBMHA  Consent  Decree \n~ \nAs  part  of  the  settlement  of  the  BMHA  Consent  Decree,  BMHA \nand  plaintiffs have  agreed  to a  Reduction  and  Revitalization  Plan \ninvolving  the  removal  of  502  units  within Commodore  Perry Homes \nand  Commodore  Perry  Extension  (the  Perry  Projects),  A.  D.  Price \nExtension and A.  D.  Price  Courts  (the  Price  Projects)  and  : \nLakeview Homes  Apartments  by  a  combination  of  demolition,  unit \nreconfiguration and  develop~ent of  a  public  housing.  Dislocatees \nwill  receive  priority of  most  of  the  \"Tenant-Based  Subsidies\", \n4 \n\nalso denominated  as,  \"Relocation Subsidies\"  or Equal  Opportunity \nSubsidies\".  HUD  will  provide  450  \"Relocation Subsidies\"  to BMHA \nfor  these  dislocatees.  In  the  event  that  the  dislocatees  do  not \nuse  all of  the  Tenant-Based  Subsidies,  BMHA  will make  them \navailable  to  class members  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of \n,s 28-34  of  the  Consent  Decree. \nB.  Objectives \nThe  purpose  of  the  CHC  is  to  seek  to  reduce  barriers  for \nminority  families  receiving  Section  8  tenant-based assistance \nfrom  the  Town  of Amherst,  New  York  in its capacity as  lead  PHA \nfor  the  Erie  County  PHA  Consortium  (through Belmont  Shelter \nCorporation)  and  from  the  City of  Buffalo,  New  York  in its \ncapacity as  a  PHA  (through Rental  Assistance  Corporation of \nBuffalo),  which may  impede  the  exercise  of  informed  choice  in \ndeciding  to move  to non-impacted areas  in Erie  County,  New  York, \nincluding within  the  City  of  Buffalo.  These  barriers may  include \nlack  of  information about  all eligible neighborhoods,  lack of \ninformation  or misinformation  about  portability features  and \nexception  rents  in the  Section  8  tenant-based program,  lack,of \ntransportation,  lack of  child  care,  difficulty in applying \neffectively for  available units,  difficulty in satisfying tenant \nscreening  requirements,  lack  of  a  comprehensive  listing of \nhousing  units  with various  forms  of  governmental  assistance,  lack \nof  affirmative marketing  efforts by  owners  of  such  units, \nlandlord unfamiliarity or misconceptions  regarding  the  Section  8 \ntenant-based program,  illegal discrimination,  and  lack of \nassistance with  transition-related problems  following  a  move. \nThe  duties  of  the  CHC  specified herein shall  initially be \nprovided  to  special  applicants  or dislocatees  from  BMHA  housing \nreceiving  Section  8  tenant-based assistance,  and  then  to \napplicants  on  the  supplemental  waiting  list  or BMHA  class \nmembers  receiving  Section  8  tenant-based assistance,  until  such • \ntime  as  the  funding  is exhausted. \nI.  Housing  Counseling Services  to  Families \nThe  CHC  shall: \nAll  of  the  following  Housing  Counseling Services  to  families \nwould  apply  to  the  families  receiving Tenant-Based Subsidies \nor Equal  Opportunity  Subsidies  from  BMBA. \nOn  behalf  of All  Special  Applic~nts Receiving Tenant-Based \nAssistance  from  RAC  or Belmont, \n1.  Hold  initial group ,~obility counseling  sessions  to \n5 \n\neducate  families  about  the  potential  benefits  of  moving  to \nnon-impacted areas  in Erie  County,  and  encourage  them  to \nchoose  to  receive  individual  mobility  counseling,  as \ndescribed  below. \n2.  Serve  as  a  clearinghouse  for  information  on potentially \navailable  housing  located  in non-impacted  areas  or non \nconcentrated areas  of  Erie  County,  including  housing  that  is \nfinanced,  in whole  or  in part,  with  Low  Income  Housing  Tax \nCredits,  mortgage  or  industrial  revenue  bonds,  FHA  mortgage \ninsurance,  or  federal  or  state  loans  or grants,  which  are \neligible  to  accept  families  with  Section  8  tenant-based \nassistance.

CURTIN \nUnited  States District Judge \n4 \n\nProposed Settlement of Housing Discrimination Class Action Lawsuit \nSettlements have been proposed in Comer y. Cisneros [CIV 89-1556C], a class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District ofNew York.  A bearing will be held on September 5, 1996 to determine whether the proposal is a fair resolution of \nthis lawsuit. \nWhat Will the Settlements Do? \nThe proposed settlements involve low income housing programs in Buffalo and Erie County.  The settlements will improve conditions in \nBMHA public housing, produce 50 new public housing units in Buffalo, provide I ,550 additional rent subsidies to class members, and \nchange the admissions procedures for the BMHA and the Section 8. rent subsidy programs.  The settlements will also create a Community \nHousing Center to provide counseling to help low income class members fmd better housing. \nWhat Was the Lawsuit About? \nThe plaintiff class in the lawsuit claimed that policies and practices in the BMHA public housing and Erie County Section 8 rent subsidy \nprograms illegally discriminated against minorities, creating racial segregation in public housing, and preventing minorities from obtaining \nSection 8 rent subsidies.  The defendants include the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Rental Assistance \nCorporation (RAC) and the Belmont Shelter Corporation, the City of Buffalo and the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority (BMHA). \nThe defendants deny all of plaintiffs' claims.  This proposed settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by any party. \nI \nWho is in the Class and Affected by the Settlements? \nYou are a member ofthe class and will be affected by the settlements if you are a member of a racial minority group, and: \n1.  You are, or were, a resident of Buffalo who has a Section 8 rent subsidy, or applied for one, through RAC or Belmont; 2! \n2.  You are an applicant for, or a tenant in, BMHA public housing. \nHow Will Class Members be Affected? \nIf you are a member of the class of plaintiffs, you may benefit from the provisions of the proposed settlements. As a class member you will \nalso be barred from suing any of the defendants in the future on the same claims.  • \nFor More Information:  Call the Western New York Law Center at 855-0203 or the Greater Upstate Law Project at I-800-724-\n0490, ext 650.  You may also review a copy of the proposed settlements at the Center, 454 Ellicott Square Building, 295 Main Street, \nBuffalo, NY; the Federal Court Clerk's Office, 3rd Floor, 68 Court Street, Buffalo. NY; or at anyBMHA Management Office. \nDo You Want to Comment on the Settlements? \nIf you want to comment on the proposed settlements, do not call the Court.  Instead, send your written comments directly to Judge Curtin \nby September 5, 1996. Address your envelope to: \nHonorable John T. Curtin \nU.S. District Courthouse Chambers, 6th Floor \n68 Court Street \nBuffalo, NY t4202 \nDo Yo.u Want to Speak at the Hearing?

This  is  a  class  action  to  remedy  defendants'  policies, \npractices  and  procedures  which,  for  decades,  have  deliberately \ncreated and perpetuated race discrimination within the  federal  and \nstate  funded  low-income  housing  programs  which  defendants \nadminister  in the  city  of  Buffalo  and  in  Erie  County,  New  York. \n2.  Defendants'  intentionally  discriminatory  policies  and \npractices which resulted in segregation of Buffalo's public housing \nprojects  so  pervasive  that  23  of  the  26  public  housing  projects \nunder defendants'  purview are occupied almost exclusively by either \nminority  or white  residents. \n3.  Defendants  have  systematically  impeded  minorities ' \nopportunity  to  move  to,  or  reside  in,  predominantly  white \nneighborhoods  by  instituting and  administering  separate  Section  8 \nrental  housing  programs  for  suburban  and  city  residents. \nSpecifically,  the suburban Section  8  rental housing programs  grant \npreferences  to  suburban  residents,  while  the  Section  8  rental \nhousing programs for city residents restrict participants to rental \nhousing  within  the  city of  Buffalo.  • \n4.  Defendants  have  neither  affirmatively  promoted  fair \n~ \nhousing,  nor  taken  action to remedy  or avoid  the effects  of  racial \ndiscrimination and segregation,  despite legal obligations to do so. \n5.  Plaintiffs have  suffered  loss  of  economic,  educational, \nsocial  and  employment  opportunities,  as  well  as  humiliation  and \nembarassment,  through  the  denial  of  equal  housing  opportunities \ncaused  by  defendants'  policies,  practices  and  procedures  and  the \nstigma  of  racial  discri~ination. \n3 \n\nII.

CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n31.  Plaintiffs bring this action on  behalf  of  a  class  of  all \n~ \nnamed  plaintiffs,  and  on  behalf  of  all  other  persons  similarly \nsituated,  pursuant to Rules  23(a)  and 23(b) (2)  of the Federal Rules \nof  Civil  Procedure. \n32.  The  class  that  plaintiffs  seek  to  represent  consists  of \nI \nI \nall  current,  former  and  future  residents  of  the  Buffalo \n11  metropolitan statistica;  area who  have  been,  who  are  being,  or who \n9 \n'i  \nd \n11· \nI· \nII \n,I \n\nmay  be,  denied  equal  access  to  state  and  federally  funded  low \nincome  housing  programs,  attendant  services  and  other  benefits  of \nequal  and  racially  integrated housing,  on  account  of  their race or \n• \ncolor. \n33.  This  class  includes: \na.  approximately  10,200  people  currently  residing  in \nstate  and  federally  funded  public  housing  projects \nin  the  city of  Buffalo; \nb.  approximately  3,000 households currently on waiting \nlists for state and  federally  funded  public housing \nprojects  in  the  city of  Buffalo; \nc.  approximately 5,500 households participating in the \nSection  8  rental  housing  assistance  programs \nadministered  by  defendants; \nd.  approximately 8,000 households currently on waiting \nlists  for  Section  8  rental  housing  assistance \nprograms  administered  by  defendants; \ne.  approximately  71,000  households  with  incomes  at or \n• \nbelow  50%  of  the  median  income  within  Erie  County, \nNew  York,  who  ar~ eligible for,  but not being served \nby,  Section  8  rental  housing  assistance  programs \nadministered  by  defendants. \n3 4.  This  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  class \nmembers  is  impracticable. \n35.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  all  class \nmembers,  namely,  whether  defendants'  policies,  practices  and \n+ \n10 \nI \nI \n\nprocedures  with  respect  to  state  and  federally  funded  low-income \nhousing  programs  discriminate  against  plaintiffs  on  the  basis  of \nplaintiffs'  race,  color  or  national  origin,  in  violation  of  the \n• \nco~stitution and  laws  of  the  United  States  and  the  State  of  New \nYork. \n36.

The  named  plaintiffs will  fairly  and  adequately  protect \nand  represent  the  interests  of  the  class  members.  Plaintiffs  are \nrepresented  by  counsel  experienced  in  federal  court  class  action \nlitigation  involving  housing  matters  and  race  discrimination \nmatters. \n38.  ·Defendants have  acted on  grounds  generally applicable to \nthe  class  members;  namely,  defendants  have  implemented  and \nperpetuated  policies,  practices  and  procedures  which \nunconstitutionally  and  illegally  discriminate  against  the  class \nmembers  on  the basis of the class members'  race,  color  or national \norigin,  in  violation  of  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United \n• \nStates  and  the  State  of  New  York. \n39.  Accordingly,  final j.njunctive and declaratory relief with \nrespect  to  the  class  members  as  a  whole  is  appropriate  in  this \naction. \nV.  FACTS  RELATED  TO  BUFFALO'S  PUBLIC  HOUSING  PROGRAM \nA.  Policies  of  Racial  Discrimination \n40.  Twenty-two  of  the  twenty-five  federally  funded  public \n, housing  projects  owned~  operated  and  administered  by  defendants \nI \n11 \n.i \n\nBMHA,  City  of  Buffalo  and  Grisanti  are  racially  identifiable. \n41.  Two  of  the  four  state  funded  public  housing  projects \nowned, . operated  and  administered  by  defendants  BMHA,  City  of \n.·. \nBuff~lo, Grisanti  and Higgins  are  racially identifiable.  They  are \nFrederick  Douglass  Towers  and  Ferry-Grider  Homes. \n42.  TWo  state  funded  public  housing  projects  stand  vacant. \nThey  are  Kensington  Heights  and  Ellicott Mall. \n4 3.  Two  of  the  public  housing  projects  have  nearly  100% \nminority  populations.  They  are  Frederick  Douglass  Towers  and \nScattered  Site B,  also  known  as  Woodson  Gardens. \n44.  Three  of  the  public  housing  projects  have  nearly  100% \nwhite  populations,  and  in  fact  may  have  never  housed  a  minority \ntenant.  They  are  Mullen  Manor,  Slater  Courts  and  Elmherst \nApartments. \n45.  Nine  of  the  public  housing  projects  have  minority \npopulations  between  90%  and  100%.  They  are  Kenfield  Apartments, \nA.D.  Price  Court,  A.D.  Price  Court  Extension·,  Commodore  Perry \nHomes,  Commodore  Perry  Homes  Extension,  Langfield  Homes,  Ferry-\nGrider  Homes,  Kelly  Gardens  and  Scattered  Site  A,  also  known  as \nRedwood  Village. \n46.  Eight  of  the  public  housing  projects  have  white \npopulations  in  excess  of  82%.  They  are  LaSalle  Courts,  Monsignor \nGeary  Apartments,  stuyvesant  Apartments,  Frank  A.  Sedita \nApartments,  Holling Homes,  Kowal  Apartments,  Camden  Apartments  and \nScattered  Site  C  (various  locations) . \n... \n12 \nI \nI \nII \n''•I  \n\n47.  Two  of  the  public  housing  projects  have  minority \npopulations between  70%  and  80%.  They  are  Lakeview Apartments  and \nSchwab  Terrace . \n• \n• \n48.  The  racially  identifiable  minority  public  housing \nprojects  are  located  in  racially  identifiable  minority \nneighborhoods. \n49.  The  racially  identifiable white  public  housing  projects \nare  located  in  racially  identifiable white  neighborhoods. \n50.  From  the  late 1940s  until 1985,  defendants  BMHA  and  City \nof  Buffalo  have  perpetuated  public  housing  segregation,  in  part, \nby maintaining separate waiting lists for  individual public housing \nprojects,  which  were  used  for  the  purpose  and  effect  of  assuring \nthat minority applicants were directed to particular public housing \nprojects  in a  racially  discriminatory manner. \n51.  Defendants  BMHA  and  City  of  Buffalo  continued  to  use \nseparate waiting lists for individual public housing projects until \n1985,  when a  \"community-wide\" waiting list was  adopted,  purportedly \nI \nestablishing one waiting list for all defendant BMHA  public housing  I \n•  I \nprojects.  ! \n52.  The  failure  of  de~ndants BMHA  and  City  of  Buffalo  to I \nI \nimplement  a  community-wide  waiting  list  for  public  housing \nI-\napplicants  until  1985  reinforced  and  increased  the  historical I \nracial  segregation  of  defendant  BMHA's  public  housing  projects. \n53.  Hhen  defendant  :SMHA  implemented  the  communi ty-v.•ide \nwaiting  list in  1985,  it also  incorporated  a  11preferred placement11 \npolicy  which  allowed  p~blic housing  applicants  to  identify  three \n13 \n\npublic  housing  projects  in  which  they  would  accept  an  available \napartment. \n54.  This  preferred  placement  policy  had  the  purpose  and \neffeca:t  of  perpetuating  racial  segregation  in  defendant  BMHA' s \npublic housing  projects. \n55.  In  1987,  with  defendant  HUD ' s  approval,  defendant  BMHA \npurportedly adopted  a  \"vacancy-driven\"  placement system based  upon \na  community-wide  waiting  list. \n56.  This  vacancy-driven  placement  system  remains  in  effect \ntoday. \n57.  Under  the  vacancy-driven  placement  system,  a  public \nhousing  applicant  who  reaches  the  top  of  defendant  BMHA' swaiting \nlist is offered an apartment  in the public housing project with the \nnumber  of  vacancies. \nlarges~ \n58.  If  the  applicant  rejects  the  first-offered  apartment, \ndefendant BMHA  will offer that applicant an apartment  in the public \nhousing project with  the  next  greatest  number  of  vacancies. \n59.  A  public  housing  applicant  may  refuse  up  to  three \napartments  before  being  placed  at  the  bottom  of  defendant  BMHA '·s \npublic  housing  waiting  list.  ., \n60.  Defendants  BMHA  and  Grisanti  have  also  incorporated  a \nvariety of exceptions to the vacancy-driven placement  system based \nupon  factors  such  as  employment,  education  and  medical  hardship, \nwhich  have  been  applied  subjectively  and  in  a  racially \ndiscriminatory manner. \n61.  Despite  the  adoption  of  the  vacancy-driven  placement \n.. \n14 \nI! \n\nsystem,  white  public  housing  applicants  continue  to  be  placed  in \nlow  vacancy,  predominantly  white  public  housing  projects. \n•  62.  Conversely,  minority  public  housing  applicants  continue \n• \nto be placed in high vacancy,  predominantly minority public housing \nprojects. \n63.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  racially  discriminatory \npurpose  and  effect  of  defendant  BMHA's  policies. \n64.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  failed to eradicate the discriminatory  impact  of  defendant \nBMHA's  policies  of  racial  discrimination. \n65.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins'  policies  instead  have  continued  to  create,  maintain  and \nperpetuate racially segregated public housing in Buffalo,  New  York. \nB.  Racially  Discriminatory  Practices \nin  Tenant  Selection  and  Placement \n66.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo  and  Grisanti  have \ncreated,  and  have  continued,  a  variety  of  practices  which  place \napplicants  for  state  and  federally  funded  public  housing  into \n~ \nhousing  projects  in  which  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the \nI \nresidents  are  of  the  same  race  or  color  as  that  of  the  applicant. \n67.  From the early 1970s until the late 1970s,  defendant BMHA \nstaff  verbally  informed  prospective  public  housing  tenants  of \navailable  apartments. \n68.  Defendant BHHA  staff told white public housing applicants \nabout  apartment  vacandies  in  predominantly  white  public  housing \n15 \n\nprojects  but  not  about  vacancies  in  predominantly minority  public \nhousing  projects. \n69.  Minority  applicants  were  told  about  apartment  vacancies \n, \nin predominantly minority public housing projects or in particular \nproj~cts located  in  neighborhoods  shifting  from  white  to  minority \nconcentration. \n70.  Minority  public  housing  applicants  were  discouraged  by \ndefendant  BMHA  staff  from  applying  for  apartments  in  certain \npredominantly  white  public  housing  projects. \n71.  From  the  late  1970s  until  1985,  the  vacancy  lists which \nwere  distributed  by  defendant  BMHA  staff  to  prospective  public \nhousing  tenants  did  not  include  all  available  apartments. \n72.  White -public  housing  applicants  were  told  by  defendant \nBMHA  staff  of  vacan_cies  in  predominantly  white  public  housing \nprojects  which  did  not  appear  on  the  published  lists. \n73.  During  this  time,  defendant  BMHA  also  allowed  white \npublic  housing  applicants  to  have  their  names  placed  on  waiting \nlists  for  public  housing  projects  not  available  to  minority \n• \napplicants. \n74.  Defendant  BMHA  also ..,solicited  applications  from  white \npersons  and  households  for  new  public  housing  projects  in \npredominantly  white  neighborhoods  prior to  public  announcement  of \nthe  availability of  apartments  in  those  public housing  projects. \n75.  Defendant  BMHA  also  used  a  policy  of  \"priority \nadmissions\"  which  had  the  purpo~e  and  effect  of  placing  white \npublic  housing  applicant~  in  predominantly  white  public  housing \n16 \n\nprojects out of  chronological  order  on  the waiting  lists,  ahead  of \nminority  applicants  for  the  same  public  housing  projects. \n76.  Defendants  BMHA,  city of  Buffalo and  Grisanti have  also \npermitted non-financially eligible white  public housing applicants \nto. be  certified  for  placement  in  public  housing  by  failing  to \nverify  their  financial  eligibility. \n77.  Since  1987,  defendant  BMHA  policies,  practices  and \nprocedures  have  required  that public  housing  tenants  transferring \nfrom  one  apartment  to  another  will  be  assigned  to  a  new  apartment \nwithin  his  or  her  current  public  housing  project  only,  unless \nappropriate  apartments  do  not  exist  in  their  current  project. \n78.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  racially  discriminatory \npurpose  and  effect  of  defendant  BMHA' s  practices. \n79.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  have  failed  to  eradicate  the  impact  of  defendant  BMHA' s \nracially discriminatory  practices. \n80.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \n• \nHiggins '  practices  instead  have  continued  to  create,  maintain  and \nperpetuate racially segregate~ public housing in Buffalo,  New  York. \nC.  Racially  Disparate  conditions  and  Services \n81.  The  condition  of  the  housing  and  the  levels  of  the \namenities  and  services  provided  in  predominantly  minority  public \nhousing  projects  are  substantia~ly inferior  to  those  provided  in \npredominantly white  pu~lic housing  projects. \n17 \n\n82.  Many  of  the  apartments  in  the  older,  predominantly \nminority  public  housing  projects  lack  basic  amenities  such  as \nshowers· and  standard  size  stoves  and  refrigerators. \n83.  Many  of  the  apartments  in  the  older,  predominantly \nminority public housing projects contain exposed  lead-based paint, \nposing  a  danger  to  the  resident  children. \n84.  The  predominantly  minority  public  housing  projects \ntypically  have  barren  lawns,  broken  and  boarded  up  windows,  dirty \nand graffiti-covered common  halls and  stairways,  grounds  dominated \nby  garbage-filled  dumpsters  and  power  transformers  protected  only \nby  chain  link  fences. \n85.  In  sharp  contrast,  newer,  predominantly  white  public \nhousing  projects  are  neatly  landscaped  by  defendant  BMHA  and \ncontain  attractive community  areas  for  the  tenants. \n86.  These newer,  predominantly white public housing projects ' \napartments also contain various amenities such as showers,  standard \nsize  appliances,  air conditioners  and  carpeting. \n87.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo  and  Grisanti  fail  to \ninspect and maintain predominantly minority public housing projecis \nroutinely  and  adequately. \n88.  Security  in  defendant  BMHA's  predominantly  minority \npublic  housing  projects  is  inadequate,  rendering  these  public \nhousing  projects  unsafe  and  unsuitable  for  normal  use. \n89.  In  sharp  contrast,  a  sufficient  level  of  security  is \nprovided to  ensure  the  safety of  the residents  in defendant  BMHA' s \npredominantly  white  public..   housing  projects . \n18 \nII \n\n90.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  racially  identifiable \ndisparities  in  conditions  and  services  at defendant  BMHA' s  public \nhousing  projects. \n91.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  have  failed  to  eradicate  these  racially  identifiable \ndisparities  in  conditions  and  services  at  defendant  BMHA's  public \nhousing  projects. \nD.  Racial  Discrimination  in  Public  Housing  for  the  Elderly \n92.  There  are  seventeen  defendant  BMHA  public  housing \nprojects which  contain  apartments  designated  for  the  elderly. \n93.  Thirteen  of  these  seventeen  projects  are  designated \nexclusively  for  the  elderly;  the  remaining  four  projects  are \ncombinations  of  family  and  elderly. \n94.  Nine  of the thirteen projects designated exclusively for \nthe  elderly  have  white  populations  in  excess  of  92%.  They  are \nElmherst  Apartments,  camden  Apartments,  Holling  Homes,  Kowal \nApartments,  Frank A.  Sedita Apartments,  Monsignor Geary Apartments, \nStuyvesant  Apartments,  Slate• Courts  and  Mullen  Manor. \n95.  Three  of  the  remaining  four  projects  designated \nexclusively for  the elderly have minority populations  in excess  of \n1 \n70%.  They  are  A.D.  Price  Court  Extension  (99%),  Kelly  Gardens \n(88%),  and  Schwab  Terrace  (71%). \n96.  Two  of the four combined elderly/family projects are over \n96%  minority.  They  are  Frederick  Douglass  Towers  (100%)  and \nI  ... \n'I \nI  19 \nI, \nI, \nI, \n\nCommodore  Perry Homes  Extension  (96%). \n97.  A  third  combined  elderly/family  project,  Lakeview \nApartments,  is  77%  minority. \n98.  The  fourth  combined  elderly/family  project,  Shaffer I \nVillage,  is  67%  white. \n99.  Defendants  BMHA,  city  of  Buffalo  and  Grisanti,  with  the \napproval of defendant HUD  and the predecessor of defendant Higgins, \nconverted  numerous  units  within  these  family  housing  projects  for \nuse  as  apartments  designated  for  th~ elderly. \n100.  With  the  exception  of  Shaffer  Village,  these  converted \nelderly units  are  located  in  predominantly  minority  neighborhoods \nand  in .public  housing  projects  which  are  overwhelmingly  minority. \n101.  With  the  exception  of  Shaffer  Village,  defendants  BMHA, \nCity  of  Buffalo  and  Grisanti  have  placed  elderly  minority  public \nhousing  applicants,  but  not  white  applicants,  in  these  converted \nelderly/family projects. \n102.  Defendants BMHA,  City of Buffalo and Grisanti have placed \nelderly white public housing  applicants  in public housing projects \nbuilt  and  designated  exclusively  for  the  elderly,  located  in \npredominantly white  neighborhoajs. \n103.  These elderly public housing projects are overwhelmingly \noccupied  by  white  tenants. \n104.  According  to  defendant  HUD  records,  one  of  the  public \nhousing projects built and  designated exclusively for  the elderly, \nMullen  Manor,  has  had  no  minori t_y  individuals  or  households  as \nresidents,  although  fifty-two  minority  individuals  and  households \n+ \n20 \n1: \nII \nII \nII \nI! \n\nhad  applied  for  admission  to  that  particular  public  housing \nproject. \n105.  Defendant  HUD  did  not  pursue  the  denial  of  these  fifty-\n• \ntwo  minority  public  housing  applications  for  defendant  BMHA • s \nMullen  Manor. \n106.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  racially  discriminatory \npurpose and  effect of defendant BMHA's  policies and  practices with \nrespect  to defendant  BMHA's  public housing  for  the  elderly. \n107.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins  have  failed-to  eradicate the  discriminatory  impact  of  the \nracially  discriminatory  policies  and  practices  with  respect  to \ndefendant  BMHA's  public  housing  for  the  elderly. \n108.  Defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo,  Grisanti,  HUD  and \nHiggins•  policies  instead  have  continued  to  create,  maintain  and \nperpetuate racially  segregated  public  housing  for  the  elderly. \nE.  Facts  Related  to  Defendant  HUD's  Acts  and  Omissions \n109.  Defendant HUD  has  long known  or  should have  known  of the \nracially  discriminatory  pu~pose  and  effect  of  the  policies, \npractices  and  procedures  of  defendants  BMHA,  City  of  Buffalo  and \nGrisanti  with  respect  to  public  housing,  but  has  not  stopped  or \ncorrected  them. \n110.  On  or about July  28,  1970,  defendant HUD  issued  a  report \nreviewing  defendant  BMHA 1s  prac~ices,  policies,  and  procedures. \nI \nI;  ·+ \nI \n21 \n\n111.  In that report,  defendant HUD  noted that tenant selection \nprocedures  being  followed  by  defendant  BMHA  had  not  been  approved \nby  defendant  HUD,  and  recommended  that  defendant  BMHA  obtain \n• \napproval  for  the  plan  in  use. \n112.  By  1970,  defendant  HUD  knew  or  should  have  known  that \ndefendant  BMHA' s  tena.nt  selection  procedures  were  racially \ndiscriminatory  in  purpose  and  effect. \n113.  At  that  time,  defendant  HUD  failed  to  order  defendants \nBMHA  or City of Buffalo to terminate their racially discriminatory \ntenant  selection procedures,  to remedy  the effects  of  prior racial \ndiscrimination,  or  otherwise  to  act  itself  to  stop  racial \ndiscrimination  in  defendant  BMHA  public  housing. \n114.  In  1983,  defendant  HUD  conducted  a  Compliance  Review  of \ndefendant  BMHA  pursuant  to  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of \n1964. \n115.  In its Compliance Review Report,  defendant HUD  found that \ndefendant  BMHA's  tenant  selection  procedures  created  and \nperpetuated  racial  segregation  in  public  housing  projects. \n116.  At  that  time,  defendant  HUD  failed  to  order  defendants \nBMHA  or City of Buffalo to ter~nate their racially discriminatory \ntenant selection procedures,  to remedy  the effects  of  prior racial \ndiscrimination,  or  otherwise  to  act  itself  to  stop  racial \ndiscrimination  in  defendant  BMHA  public  housing. \n117.  On  or  about  May  20,  1985,  defendant  HUD  published  an \nOccupancy Audit reviewing defendant BMHA' s  practices,  policies and \nprocedures.  .. \n. \n22 \n\ni' \n118.  In  its  Occupancy  Audit,  defendant  HUD  again  found  that \ndefendant  BMHA 1 s  tenant  selection  plan  created  and  perpetuated \nracial  segregation  in  public housing  projects. \n119.  Again,  defendant  HUD  failed  to  order  defendants  BMHA  or \ncity  of  Buffalo  to  terminate  their  racially discriminatory  tenant \nselection  procedures,  to  remedy  the  effects  of  prior  racial \ndiscrimination,  or  otherwise  to  act  itself  to  stop  racial \ndiscrimination  in  defendant  BMHA  public  housing. \n120.  In  mid-1987,  defendant  HUD  issued  a  Fair  Housing  and \nEqual  Opportunity  Report  reviewing  defendant  BMHA 1 s  practices, \npol icies  and  procedures. \n121.  In  that  report,  defendant  HUD  once  again  found  that \ndefendant  BMHA1s  tenant  selection  procedures  created  and \nperpetuated  racial  segregation  in  public  housing. \n122.  Once again,  defendant HUD  failed to order defendants BMHA \nor  City  of  Buffalo  to  terminate  their  racially  discriminatory \n• \ndiscrimination  in  defendant  BMHA  public  housing. \n123.  On  or  about  April ~9,  1988,  defendant  HUD  released  an \nOccupancy  Audit  reviewing  defendant  BMHA;  the  audit  had  been \nconducted  between  September  1987  and  February  1988.  The  audit \npurported  to  include  a  Title  VI  Compliance  Review  of  defendant \nBMHA 1s  tenant  selection  procedures. \n124.  Despite  the  Title VI  ~ompliance Review  component  of  the \n1987-1988  audit,  defendant  HUD  made  no  findings  concerning \n... \n23 \nI \nI \n1! \n\ndefendant  BMHA's  racially  discriminatory  tenant  selection \nprocedures. \n125.  on  April  25,  1989,  defendant HUD  notified defendant  BMHA \n• \nthat  its tenant  selection  policies,  practices  and  procedures  from \nat least 1976  until 1985  unlawfully discriminated against minority \npublic  housing  applicants  and  tenants. \n126.  Defendant  HUD' s  notification  letter  failed  to  specify \nthat defendant BMHA'S  policies,  practices and procedures  from  1985 \nuntil  the  present  created  and  perpetuated  racial  segregation  in \npublic  housing. \n127.  Nevertheless,  defendant  HUD  did  notify  defendant  BMHA \nthat the tenant selection policies,  practices and procedures  it had \nadopted  in  1987  were  inadequate  to  address  the  extreme  racial \nsegregation  created  in  prior years. \n128.  Defendant HUD's  notification letter listed several steps \ndefendant  BMHA  could  voluntarily  take  to  remedy  the  segregation \nresulting  from  its racially discriminatory  policies  and  practices \nfrom  1976  until  1985. \n• \n129.  These proposed voluntary actions are  insufficient to end \ncurrent  racially  discriminator~ practices  and  to  remedy  existing \nracial  segregation  and  discrimination  in Buffalo's  public  housing \nprogram. \n130.  According  to defendant HUD ' s  April  25,  1989  notification \nletter,  a  \"Compliance  Agreement\"  was  required  to  be  executed  by \ndefendants  HUD  and  BMHA  within  60  days  of  the  date  of  the  letter. \n24 \n\n131.  on  September  25,  1989,  more  than  150  days  after the date \nof defendant HUD's  April  25,  1989  notification letter to defendant \nBMHA,  defendant  HUD  sent  a  \"Voluntary  Compliance  Agreement\"  to \n• \ndefendant  BMHA  for  its  review. \n132.  The  Voluntary  Compliance  Agreement  is wholly  inadequate \nin  numerous  respects,  including  but  not  limited  to: \n(a)  it  fails  to  provide  sufficient  notice  to  affected \npublic  housing  applicants  and  tenants; \n(b)  it fails  to mandate  procedures  sufficient  to  create \na  racially  non-discriminatory  public  housing  tenant  selection \nsystem; \n(c)  it fails to mandate procedures which eliminate racial \ndiscrimination  in public  housing  facility  condition,  maintenance, \nrepair,  and  security; \n(d)  it fails  to mandate  affirmative  remedial  actions  to \nremedy  consequences  and  effects  of  prior  racially  discriminatory \npolicies,  practices  and  procedures  in  Buffalo's  public  housing \nprogram. \n• \n133.  Without  explanation,  the  proposed  Voluntary  Compliance \nI \nAgreement  from  defendant  HUD  dated  September  25,  1989  omits \nI· \nremedies  proposed  in  defendant  HUD's  notification  letter of  April \n25,  1989  to  defendant  BMHA.  II  \n134.  As  of the date of this complaint,  no Voluntary Compliance  I \nI \nAgreement  has  been  executed  or  put  into  effect between  defendants \n' \nHUD  and  BMHA. \n135.  As  of the da~e of this complaint,  defendant HUD  continues \n25 \n,I \nil \n\nto fund  defendant  BMHA  while defendants  BMHA,  City of  Buffalo,  and \nGrisanti  continue  to  implement  their  racially  discriminatory \npolicies,  practices  and  procedures  in  Buffalo's  public  housing \nprogram. \n13 6.  As  of  the  date  of  this  complaint,  defendant  HUD  has \nfailed  to  stop  defendant  BMHA's  racially  discriminatory  policies \nand  practices. \nF.  Facts  Related  to  the  Mayor  of  the  city of  Buffalo \n137 .  The  Mayor  of the  city of  Buffalo  is directly responsible \nfor  ensuring  that  all  municipal  departments,  agencies  and \ninstrumentalities comply with applicable law,  and  for  implementing \npolicies,  practices  and  procedures  which  will  ensure  such \ncompliance. \n138.  As  Mayor  of  the  city  of  Buffalo,  defendant  Griffin  has \nappointed  five  of  the  seven  co:nrnissioners  who  govern  defendant \nBMHA. \n139.  Under  New  York Public Housing Law  §34,  defendant Griffin \n• \nhas  the  statutory  authority  to  remove  his  appointed  commissioners \nfor  inefficiency,  neglect  of  d~ty,  or misconduct  in  office. \n140.  Defendant  Griffin  has  assumed  a  direct  role  in  the \npolicies  and  operations  of  defendant  BMHA. \n141.  Defendant  Griffin  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the \nracially  discriminatory  policies,  practices  and  procedures \nimplemented  and  perpetuated  by  defendant  BMHA. \n142.  Defendant  Griffin  has  failed  to  remove  any  of  the \n... \n26 \nII \n!I \n\ndefendant  BMHA  commissioners  responsible  for  implementing  and \nperpetuating  defendant  BMHA 1 s  racially  discriminatory  policies, \npractices  and  procedures. \n143.  As  Mayor  of  the  city  of  Buffalo,  defendant  Griffin  has \nfailed  to  take  any  action  to  ensure  that  defendant  BMHA  prevents \nand  remedies  racial  segregation  in  its public  housing  program. \nG.  Facts  Related  to  Individual Plaintiffs'  Public Housing  Claims \n144.  Each  of  the  plaintiffs  named  in  this  action  has  been \ndenied  the  opportunity  for  fair  housing  by  defendants 1  acts, \nomissions,  policies,  practices  and  procedures  as  described  above, \nand  mor~ pa~ticularly as  described  below. \n145.  Plaintiff Jessie  comer  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Jessie  Comer  applied  for  public  housing  with \ndefendant  BMHA  in  1983. \nb.  At  that time,  Ms.  Jessie Comer  was  given the choice \nof  residing  in  one  of  three  BMHA  public  housing \nprojects,  namely,  Frederick  Douglass  Towers, \nCommodore  Perry  Homes,  or  Langfield  Homes. \nc.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is \n#J \noccupied  predominantly  by  minorities. \nd.  Ms.  Jessie Comer  was  eventually placed by defendant \nBMHA  in  Langfield  Homes. \ne.  In  1987,  due  to  the  deplorable  physical  conditions \nand  increasing  drug  and  criminal  activities  at \nLangfield  Homes,  Ms.  Jessie  Comer  requested  that \n,., \n27 \nI \nI \n! \n! I \nI' \n\ndefendant BMHA  transfer her to another apartment or \npublic housing  project. \nf .  Ms.  Jessie Comer was subsequently transferred to the \n•  Kenfield  Apartments,  a  BMHA  public  housing  project \npredominantly  occupied  by  minorities. \ng.  Kenfield Apartments  are also in deplorable physical \ncondition,  and  are  the  site  of  considerable  drug \nand  criminal  activities. \n146. ·Plaintiff  Rosemary  Comer  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer  applied  for  public  housing  with \ndefendant  BMHA  in  1987. \nb.  At  that  time,  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer  was  given  the \nchoice  of  residing  in  one  of  three  BMHA  public \nhousing projects, namely,  Frederick Douglass Towers, \nCommodore  Perry  Homes,  or  Langfield  Homes. \nc.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is \noccupied  predominantly  by  minorities. \nd.  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer  was  eventually  placed  by \ndefendant  BMHA  in  Langfield  Homes,  over•  her \nobjection. \ne.  In  1989,  due  to  the  deplorable  physical  conditions \nand  increasing  drug  and  criminal  activities  at \nLangf ield  Homes,  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer  requested  a \ntransfer to another BMHA  apartment or public housing \nproject. \nf.  When  Ms.  Rosemary  Corner ' s  requests  for  a  transfer \n• \n28 \nli \n\nwere rejected,  she vacated Langfield Homes,  and was \nforced  into  the  private housing  market. \ng.  Because  of  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer's  limited  income  and \nthe  size  of  her  family,  the  only  housing  available \nto  her  in  the  private  housing  market  was  and  is \ngrossly  substandard. \nh.  Ms.  Rosemary  Comer  has  subsequently  applied  for \nSection  8  subsidized  rental  housing,  and  is \ncurrently  on  defendant  RAC's  waiting  list. \n147 .  Plaintiff  Jewel  Culverhouse  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Culverhouse  applied  for  public  housing  with  I \ndefendant  BMHA  in  1988. \nb.  At  that  time,  Ms.  Culverhouse  was  given  the  choice \nof  residing  in  one  of  five  defendant  BMHA  public \nhousing projects, namely,  Frederick Douglass Towers, \nA.D.  Price  Court,  Commodore  Perry  Homes,  Kenfield \nApartments  or  Langfield Homes. \nc.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is \n• \noccupied  predominantly  by  minorities. \nd.  Ms.  Culverhous¥ specifically requested to be placed \nat  Shaffer  Village,  a  predominantly  white  public \nhousing  project  owned  and  operated  by  defendant \nBMHA,  where,  upon information and belief,  there were \nat  that  time,  numerous  apartments  vacant  and \nfor  occupancy. \navail~ble \n29 \n\ne.  Ms.  Culverhouse's requests were  ignored or rejected \nby  defendant  BMHA. \nf.  Ms.  Culverhouse  was  eventually  placed  at  Kenfield \nApartments. \ng.  Ms.  Culverhouse has on  numerous  occasions  requested \nthat  defendant  BMHA  transfer  her  to  another \napartment  or  public  housing  project,  but  each \nrequest  has  either  been  ignored  or  refused  by \ndefendant  BMHA. \n148.  Plaintiff Hazel  Grimes  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Grimes applied for public housing with defendant \nBMHA  in  1966. \nb.  At  that  time,  Ms.  Grimes  was  given  the  choice  of \nresiding  in  one  of  four  defendant  BMHA  public \nhousing  projects,  namely,  Ferry-Grider  Homes, \nLakeview  Apartments,  Commodore  Perry  Homes  or \nLangfield  Homes. \nc.  At  that  time,  Ferry-Grider  Homes  had  a  94%  white \n• \npopulation,  Lakeview  Apartments  had  a  77%  white \npopulation,  Perry  Homes  had  an  81%  white \nCo~odore \npopulation  and  Langfield  Homes  had  a  94%  white \npopulation. \nd.  In  1966,  Langfield  Homes  was  located  in  a \nneighborhood  that was  predominantly white. \ne .  Ms.  Grimes was placed by defendant BMHA  at Langfield \nHomes,  where  she  was  one  of  the  first  minority \n,., \n30 \n\nresidents.  Ms.  Grimes  has  lived at Langfield Homes \nsince  that  time. \nf .  Between  1966  and  the present,  the population of  the \nneighborhood  where  Langfield  Homes  is  located  has \nshifted  from  predominantly  white  to  overwhelmingly \nminority. \ng.  Between  19 66  and  the  present,  the  population  of \nLangfield  Homes  has  shifted  from  94%  white  to  92% \nminority. \nh.  Between  1966  and  the  present,  the  population  of \nFerry-Grider  Homes  shifted  from  94%  white  to  98% \nminority;  the  population  of  Commodore  Perry  Homes \nhas  shifted from  81%  white  to 94%  minority;  and  the \npopulation  of  Lakeview  Apartments  has  shifted  from  I \n77%  white  to  77%  minority. \nI \ni.  Ms.  Grimes  has  repeatedly  complained  about  the \nI \ndeplorable  physical  conditions  and  increasing  drug \nI \nand  criminal  activities at Langfield  Homes. \nI \nI \nI \nj .  Over the years,  Ms.  Grimes has contacted her project \nmanagers  at  L~ngfield Homes  to  request  a  transfer I \nI \nto another BMHA  apartment or public housing project,  I \nI \nand  for  information  regarding  how  to  apply  for \nSection  8  subsidized  rental housing  in  the  city of  I \nI \nBuffalo  and  in  the  suburbs  surrounding  the  city. \nI  I \nI \nI  I \nI \nr \n! \ni \nI \ni \n31 \ni \n\nk.  On  each  occasion,  Ms.  Grimes '  requests  for  a \ntransfer  and  information  about  Section  8  rental \nhousing were  ignored or rejected by defendant BMHA. \n1.  Ms.  Grimes  has  been  told by defendant  BMHA  that she \ncannot transfer to another public housing  apartment \nor  project  until  she  is  60  years  old  and  thus \nqualifies for elderly public housing with defendant \nBMHA. \n149.  Plaintiff Annette  McCutcheon  is  black. \na.  Ms.  McCutcheon  applied  for  public  housing  with \ndefendant  BMHA  in  1980. \nb.  At  that  time,  Ms.  McCutcheon  was  given  the  choice \nof  residing  in  one  of  four  BMHA  public  housing \nprojects,  namely,  Lakeview  Apartments,  Commodore \nPerry  Homes,  A.D.  Price  Court  and  Kenfield \nApartments. \nc.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is \noccupied  predominantly  by  minorities. \nd.  Ms.  McCutcheon  was  eventually  placed  by  defendant \nBMHA  at  Commodoce  Perry  Homes,  where  she  resided \nuntil  1.985. \ne.  In 1985,  Ms.  McCutcheon moved  out of public housing \nbecause of the deplorable conditions and  increasing \ndrug  and  criminal  activities  at  Commodore  Perry \nHomes. \n32 \nI \njl \nII \n:I \n\nMs.  McCutcheon was unable to afford private housing, \nand  she  subsequently re-applied  for  public housing I \nI \nI \nwith  defendant  BMHA  in  1987.  I \nI \ng.  At  that  time,  Ms.  McCutcheon  was  given  the  choice \nI \nof  residing  at  Commodore  Perry  Homes,  Kenfield \n1 \nI \nApartments  or  Lakeview  Apartments.  I \nI \nh.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is ! \ni \npredominantly  occupied  by  minorities. \nI \ni.  Ms.  McCutcheon  was  eventually  placed  at  Commodore \ni \nPerry  Homes. \nj .  In  1989,  Ms.  McCutcheon  requested  a  transfer  to  a \nlarger  dwelling  unit,  due  to  an  increase  in  her \nfamily  size. \nk.  After  lengthy  discussions  with  defendant  BMHA,  Ms. \nMcCutcheon  was  informed  by  defendant  BMHA  that  she \ncould  transfer  to  a  larger  apartment,  but  only \nwithin  commodore  Perry Homes. \n150.  Plaintiff Matilda  Santiago  is Hispanic. \na.  Ms.  Santiago  applied  for  public  housing  with \ndefendant  in  1979. \nB~ \nb.  Ms.  Santiago  was  placed  by  defendant  BMHA  at \nLakeview  Apartments,  a  predominantly  minority \noccupied  public housing  project. \nc.  Ms.  Santiago  has  complained  to  defendant  BMHA \nfrequently  over  ~he years  regarding  the  deplorable \nphysical,. ,  conditions  in  her  apartment  and  in  her \n33 \n!I \n\napartment building, and she has repeatedly requested \nan  apartment  transfer  because  of  the  situation. \nd.  However,  defendant  BMHA  has  ignored  or  refused Ms. \nSantiago' s  requests  for  a  transfer. \n151.  Plaintiff Rosetta  Weeden  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Weeden applied for public housing with defendant \nBMHA  in  1978. \nb.  At  that  time,  Ms.  Weeden  was  given  the  choice  of \nresiding  in  one  of  five  BMHA  public  housing \nprojects,  namely,  Commodore  Perry  Homes,  Lakeview \nApartments,  Kenfield  Apartments,  Langfield  Homes \nand  Frederick  Douglass  Towers. \nc.  Each  of  these  public  housing  projects  was  and  is \noccupied  predominantly  by  minorities. \nd.  Ms.  Weeden  was  eventually placed  by  defendant  BMHA \nat Kenfield  Apartments. \ne.  Due  to  the  deplorable  physical  conditions  and \nincreasing drug and  criminal activities at Kenfield \nApartments,  Ms.  Weeden  has  requested  a  transfer  to \nanother  apartmept  or  public  housing  project  with \ndefendant  BMHA  on  a  number  of  occasions  over  the \nyears. \nf.  However,  defendant  BMHA  has  ignored  or  refused Ms. \nWeeden's  requests  for  a  transfer. \n34 \n\nVI.  FACTS  RELATED  TO  THE  CONVERSION OF  STATE  FUNDED  PUBLIC HOUSING \nTO  PRIVATELY  OWNED  HOUSING \n152.  The  Kensington  Heights  and  Ellicott Mall  public housing \nprojects  are  funded  and  supervised  by  defendant  Higgins,  and \nadministered  by  defendants  City  of  Buffalo,  BMHA  and  Grisanti,  as \nhotising  for  low-income  residents. \n153.  The  six  high-rise  buildings  of  Kensington  Heights  and \nthe  eight  high-rise  buildings  of  Ellicott Mall  include  a  total  of \n960  apartments. \n154.  When  they  were  occupied,  the  populations  of  Kensington \nHeights  and  Ellicott Mall  were  overwhelmingly  minority. \n155.  Due  to  their  failure  to  maintain  Kensington  Heights \nadequately,  defendants  City  of  Buffalo,  BMHA  and  Higgins  allowed \nthe  project to  become  uninhabitable. \n156.  Due  to  their  failure  to  maintain  Ellicott  Mall \nadequately,  defendants  City  of  Buffalo,  BMHA  and  Higgins  allowed \nthe  project to  become  uninhabitable. \n157.  Defendants  City  of  Buffalo  and  BMHA  closed  Kensington \nHeights to residents in 1980 because of the project ' s  uninhabitable \n• \nconditions. \n158.  Defendants  City of ~uffalo and  BMHA  closed Ellicott Mall \nto  residents  in  1981  because  of  the  project ' s  uninhabitable \nconditions. \n159.  Since  1980  and  1981  respectively,  the Kensington Heights \nand  Ellicott Mall  housing  projects  have  stood  vacant. \n160.  Despite the uninhabitable condition of Kensington Heights \nand Ellicott Mall housing projects,  defendant Higgins has continued \n35 \nI \n,, \n\nto  fund  defendants  City  of  Buffalo  and  BMHA  for  the  operation  of \nthese  projects. \n161.  Before  and  since  Kensington  Heights  and  Ellicott  Mall \n... \nwere vacated,  defendants City of Buffalo,  BMHA  and  Grisanti failed \nto make  these housing projects habitable for  low-income  residents. \n162.  Before  and  since  Kensington  Heights  and  Ellicott  Mall \nwere  vacated,  defendant  Higgins  failed  to  require  defendants  City \nof  Buffalo  and  BMHA  to  make  these  housing  projects  habitable  for \nlow-income  residents. \n163.  For the past several years,  defendant BMHA  has maintained \na  w~iting list of over 2000  low-income households seeking habitable \nand  affordable  public housing. \n164.  The  low-income  households  on  defendant  BMHA' s  waiting \nlist are  overwhelmingly  minority. \n165.  In  1989,  defendant  Higgins  initiated  steps  to  transfer \nthe  Kensington  Heights  and  Ellicott  Mall  public  housing  projects \nto  private ownership. \n166.  Defendants  City  of  Buffalo,  BMHA,  and  Grisanti  have \napproved  the  selection  of  private  developers  to  whom  Kensington \nHeights  and  Ellicott Mall  will~e transferred. \n167.  The  proposals  for  converting  Kensington  Heights  and \nEllicott Mall  from public to private housing  include no  provisions \nto ensure that the apartments will be made  affordable and  available \nto low-income residents who  financially qualify for public housing, \nincluding  the  households  on  defendant  BMHA's  waiting  list. \n168.  The  proposals  for  converting  Kensington  Heights  and \n... \n36 \n\nEllicott  Mall  from  public  to  private  housing  will  permanently \nremove  these  public  housing  projects  from  the  inventory  of \naffordable  housing  available  to  low-income  residents  in  Erie \nCounty. \n169.  Defendants  Higgins,  City  of  Buffalo,  BMHA  and  Grisanti \nknow  or  should  know  that  the  low-income  residents  to  whom  the \nKensington  Heights  and  Ellicott Mall  apartments  will  no  longer  be \naffordable  or  financially  available  upon  their  conversion  to \nprivate  housing,  including  the  households  on  defendant  BMHA' s \nwaiting  list,  are  predominantly  minority. \nVII.  FACTS  RELATED  TO  THE  HOUSING  AND  CO~~UNITY DEVELOPMENT \nPROGRAMS \n170.  The  Housing  and  Community  Development  Act  of  1974 \n(\"HCDA\"),  P.L.  93-383,  created  two  programs  which  are  relevant  to \nplaintiffs'  claims.  Title  I  of  the  HCDA,  §101,  et  seq.,  created \nthe  Community  Development  Block  Grant  (\"CDBG\")  program.  Title II \nof  the HCDA,  §201,  et seq.,  amended  the  United  States  Housing  Act \nof 1937  to add a  new  \"Section 8\",  which created a  program popularly \nknown  as  the  Section  8-Exist~ng Housing  program. \nA.  The  Section  a-Existing  Housing  Program \n1.  Section  a  Program  Framework \n171.  Under  the  Section  8-Existing Housing  program,  defendant \nHUD  authorizes  local  agencies,  called  PHA's,  to  issue \n\"certificates\"  and  \"vouchers\"  -:to  eligible  low-income  families, \nwhich  entitle  them  to  have  the  PHA  pay  a  portion  of  their  rent \n·+ \n37 \n\nmaximum  rent  for  a  particular market  area. \n177.  Defendant  HUD  has  adopted  the  use  of  metropolitan \nstatistical  areas  ( \"MSAs\")  which  establish  the  boundaries  of  a \nparticular market  area  upon  an  evaluation  of  \"the geographic  area \nin which  housing  units  are  in  mutual  competition,\"  and  includes \ncommuting  patterns and  population densities  in  its evaluation.  53 \nFed.Reg.  36701. \n178.  Under  this  system,  defendant  HUD  has  identified  all  of \nErie  County,  including  the  city  of  Buffalo,  as  a  single  housing \nmarket. \n179.  There  are  two  distinct  Section  a-Existing  Housing \n1 \nprograms  operating  in  Erie  County. \n180.  Defendant  HUD  has  authorized  the  city  of  Buffalo,  as  a \nPHA,  to  operate  the  Section  8  housing  program  within  the  city  of \nBuffalo. \n181.  Defendant  City  of  Buffalo  entered  an  agreement  with \ndefendant RAC  to administer the city of Buffalo's Section 8  housing \nprogram. \n• \n182.  Defendant  HUD  has  authorized  defendant  Town  of  Amherst, \nas  a  PHA,  to  operate  the  8  housing  program  on  behalf  of  a \nSec~ion \nconsortium  of  approximately  41  municipalities  encircling  the  city \nof  Buffalo. \n183.  Defendant  Town  of  Amherst  has  entered  an  agreement  with \ndefendant  Belmont  to  administer  the  suburban  Section  8  housing \nprogram. \n·• \n39 \nI \nI, \n! ! \n\n2.  statutory and  Regulatory  Framework  with  Respect  to  Geographic \nAreas  of  Operation  in  the  Section  8  Program \n184.  When  a  PHA  submits  an  application  to  defendant  HUD  to \nadminister  a  local  Section  8  housing  program,  it must  include  a \n• \ndescription  of  the  geographic  area  its  program  will  serve.  2 4 \nC.F.R.  §§882.203-4. \n185.  In  addition,  an  applicant  PHA  must  submit  an  Equal \nOpportunity  Housing  Plan  (\"EOHP\")  prior  to  executing  an  ACC  with \ndefendant  HUD.  24  C.P.R.  §882.204(b) (1). \n186.  The  EOHP  must  describe  how  the  PHA  will  achieve \nparticipation  of  landlords  owning  suitable  units  both  \"outside \nareas  of  low  income  or  minority  concentration,\"  and  \"outside  the \nlocal  jurisdiction  in any  area where  the PHA  is  not  legally barred \nfrom  entering  into  Contracts.\"  24  C.P.R.  §882.204{b) (1) (B). \n(Emphasis  added) . \n187.  Defendant  HUD  explains  statutory  and  regulatory \nrequirements  to  PHAs  through  \"Transmittals\"  and  \"Handbooks\".  The \nHandbook  applicable  to  the  Section  a-Existing  Housing  program  is \nNo.  7420.7. \n1a8.  Handbook  No.  7420.7,  Chapter  7,  entitled  \"Mobility'' \n4 \ndescribes  the  required  procedures  for  identifying  the  geographic \nareas  of  operation  within  which  a  PHA  may  enter  rent  subsidy \ncontracts  with  private  landlords. \n1a9.  Paragraph  7-1  of  the  Handbook  states  in  pertinent part: \nOne  unique  aspect  of  the  Section  a-Existing \nHousing  program  1s  that  it  encourages  and \nprovides  a  wide  rahge  of  housing  choices  for \nfamilies  participating  in  the  program.  This \nopportunit;  for  mobility  is  to  be  extended \n40 \n\nboth  to  Certificate  Holders  who  are  seeking \neligible  units  and  to  participating  families \nwho  wish  to  move  to  another  unit  or \njurisdiction  and  continue  to  receive  Section \n8  Existing  assistance.  Emphasizing  mobility \nin  this  program  promotes  a  greater  choice  of \n• \nhousing  opportunities  for  lower  income \nfamilies  and  discourages  the  concentration  of \nsuch  families  in  any  community  or \nneighborhood. \n190.  As  explained  by  defendant  HUD,  \"The  Section  a \nregulations  require the PHA  to determine  the geographic area where \nit  is  not  barred  from  entering  into  Contracts  with  landlords,\" \nHandbook  No.  7420.7,  Paragraph  7-2(a).  (Emphasis  in  original) . \n191.  Defendant  HUD  further  requires  the  PHA  to  submit  an \nopinion  of  counsel  stating  whether  or  not  the  PHA  is  legally \nprohibited  from  entering  into  contracts  with  landlords  on  an \n\"extra-territorial  basis\",  i.e.,  outside  the  PHA1s  primary \ngeographic  areas  of  operation.  Handbook  No.  7420.7,  Paragraph  7-\n2 (a) • \n192.  Defendant  HUD 1 s  regulations  and  paragraphs  7-2 (b)  and \n(c)  of  the  Handbook  require  PHAs  which  have  \"extra-territorial \n• \njurisdiction\"  to  seek  participation  of  property  owners  in  such \nareas,  and  to  advise  famil~es  \"of  their  opportunity  to  lease \nhousing  in  all  such  areas\".  2 4  c. F. R.  § 8 8 2 . 1 o3  (c) ( 1)  and  ( 2) . \n(Emphasis  added.) \n193.  Defendant  HUD  specifically  states  that,  \"the  PHA  must \nnot  (per  Section  882.103(b)  of  the  regulations)  directly  or \nindirectly  reduce  a  family 1 s  opportunity  to  choose  among  the \navailable  units.  Instead,  all  PHA  efforts  should  be  aimed  at \n•• \n41 \n\nbroadening  the  family's  choice  of  housing  possibilities.\" \nHandbook  No.  7420.7,  Paragraph  7-2(c).  (Emphasis  added.) \n194.  In  1987,  Congress  enacted  §145  of  Public  Law  100-242  to \nensure that the Section 8-Existing Housing certificate and  voucher \nprograms  are  administered  in  a  manner  that  offers  participating \nfamilies  the widest  possible geographic choice  in the  selection of \nhousing.  42  u.s.c.  §1437f{r). \n195.  42  U.S.C.  §1437f(r)  provides  that  a  certificate  or \nvoucher holder  looking  for  housing  \"may  receive  such assistance to \nrent  an  eligible  apartment  if  the  apartment  to  which  the  family \nmoves  is within the  same,  or a  contiguous metropolitan  statistical \narea as the metropolitan statistical area within which  is located, \nthe  area  of  jurisdiction  of  [a  PHA]  approving  such  assistance. \" \n{Emphasis  added.) \n3.  Facts  with  Respect  to  Illegal Restrictions  on  Geographic \nAreas  of  Operation  in  the  Buffalo/RAe  Section  8  Program \n196.  In  1976,  defendant  City  of  Buffalo  submitted  a  legal \nopinion  to  defendant  HUD  which  states  that  defendant  City  of \n• \nBuffalo  may  legally  execute  Section  8  contracts  anywhere  within \nthe  state of  New  York. \n197.  Contrary  to  the  statutory,  regulatory  and  Handbook \nprovisions  described  above,  defendants  HUD,  City  of  Buffalo  and \nRAC  have  entered  into  various  agreements,  including  but  not \nlimited  to  their  Annual  Contributions  Contracts,  Administrative \nPlans,  Equal  Opportunity  Housing  Plans,  and  Housing  Assistance \nPayments  contracts,  which..   together  act  to  restrict housing  choice \nwithin  the  Buffalo/RAC  Section  8  program  in  a  manner  that has  the \npurpose  and  effect  of  promoting  racial  segregation  of  minorities. \n42 \n,, \nI \n\n198.  Specifically,  at  some  point  after  the  submission  of  a \nrevised  Equal  Opportunity  Housing  Plan  by  defendant  City  of \nBuffalo  in  April  1985,  which  described  its  area  of  operation  as \nthe entire  state  of  New  York,  the  Buffalo/RAC's  Section  8  housing \nprogram  Administrative  Plan  restricted  the  use  of  housing \ncertificates to  the  city of  Buffalo. \n199.  Sometime  between  April  1985  and  the  present,  the \nBuffalo/RAC  Section  8  housing  program  adopted  a  policy  permitting \nfamilies  holding  Section  8  vouchers  to  use  them  outside  city  of \nBuffalo,  but  continued  to  restrict  use  of  certificates  to  the \ncity. \n200.  Families  who  had  previously  obtained  housing \ncertificates  and  who  had  found  apartments  in  the  suburbs \nsurrounding  the  city  of  Buffalo,  were  advised  that  if  their \ntenancies were terminated  for  any reason,  they would  be  restricted \nto finding  apartments within the city of Buffalo  if they wished to \ncontinue  their participation  in  the  Section  8  housing  program. \n201.  The  current  Administrative  Plan  and  Equal  Opportunity \nHousing  Plan  for  the  Buffalo/RAC  Section  8  housing  program  does \nnot  permit  families  holding  its  certificates  to  use  them  in  the \n• \nsuburbs  surrounding  the  city  of  Buffalo. \n202.  The  current  Administrative  Plan  and  Equal  Opportunity \nHousing  Plan  for  the  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program \nsimilarly makes  no  accommodation  for Buffalo/RAC  Section 8  housing \nprogram  certificate  holders  to  use  their  certificates  in  the \nsuburban  areas,  nor  is  there  a  cooperative  agreement  between  the \n... \n43 \n\nby  a  local PHA  and,  if approved  by  defendant HUD,  are  incorporated \ninto the  PHA's  Administrative  Plan.  24  C.F.R.  §882.209(a) {3)  and \n(4).  An  example  of  a  commonly  used  non-federal  preference  is  a \n11residency preference\". \n211.  Defendant  HUD  requires  that  non-federal  preferences  be \nsubordinate  to  the  statutory  federal  preferences.  24  C.F.R. \n§882.219. \n212.  Defendant  HUD  permits  that  for  10%  of  the  PHA' s  housing \ncertificates  and  vouchers,  famili~s with  non-federal  preferences \nmay  be  selected  ahead  of  families  with  federal  preferences.  24 \nC.F.R.  §882.219. \n213.  Defendant  HUD' s  definition  of  a  \"residency  preference\" \nincludes  any  applicant  residing  \"in  the  area  where  the  PHA \ndetermines  that  it  is  not  legally  barred  from  entering  into \nContracts.\"  24  C.F.R.  §882.209  (a) (4) (ii). \n214.  Overriding  all  of  the  preference  categories  is  the \nrequirement  that  such  preferences  or  priorities  must  be \nadministered  in a  manner  that is not  incompatible with  Title VI  of \nthe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  u.s.c.  §2000d  and  Title VIII  of \nthe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1968~ 42  U.S.C.  §§3601-19,  as  amended,  as \nwell  as  various  Executive  Orders  and  related  discrimination  laws. \n24  C.F.R.  §882.219(b)(3). \n215.  Similarly,  all such preferences  and  priorities are to be \nadministered  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  defendant  HUD's \naffirmative  fair  housing  oblig~tions.  42  u.s.c.  §3608(e) (5);  24 \nC.F.R.  §882.219(b) (3). \ns.  Facts  with  Respect  to  the  Use  of  Preferences  by  the \nSuburban/Belmont  section  a  Program \n45 \n\n216.  In  october  1976,  the  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing \nprogram  obtained a  legal opinion  from  the associate counsel  of  the \nNew  York  State  Comptroller's  office  advising  that  the  Section  8 \n• \nhousing  program  was  not  legally  prohibited  from  entering  into \nrental  assistance  contracts  outside  the  geographical  area  of  the \nconsortium's approximately forty-one participating municipalities. \n217.  The  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program  includes \na  local  residency  preference  for  families  who  live  or  intend  to \nwork  in  one  of  the  consortium' s  approximately  forty-one \nmunicipalities. \n218.  The  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program's  local \nresidency  preference  does  not  comply  with  the  requirements  of  24 \nC.F.R.  §882.209  (a) (4) (ii)  insofar  as  it does  not  extend  to  the \nentire  area  where  the  PHA  has  determined  that  it is  \"not  legally \nbarred  from  entering  into  Contracts. \"  24  C.F.R.  §882.209(a) (4) \n( ii) . \n219.  Although  the  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program \nis  not  legally barred  from  entering  into  contracts  in  the  city  of \nBuffalo,  its  Administrative  Plan  does  not  extend  the  residency \npreference  to  residents  of  the~city of  Buffalo. \n220.  The  approximate racial composition of the municipalities \ncomprising  the  suburban  consortium  is  97%  white  and  3%  minority. \n221.  The  city  of  Buffalo  has  a  minority  population  of  30%. \n222.  The  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program \n1 \nadministers  approximately  2800  h~using  certificates  and  housing \nvouchers. \n46 \nII \n\n223.  Approximately  4%  of  these  rental  subsidies  are  held  by \nminority families;  approximately 96%  of these rental subsidies are \nheld  by  white  families . \n• \n224.  Approximately  21%  of  the  families  on  the  suburban; \nBelmont  Section  8  housing  program 1 s  waiting  list  of  over  3, 800 \nhouseholds  are  minorities. \n225.  By  providing  a  preference  to  the  residents  of  the \nconsortium's  approximately  41  municipalities,  nearly  all  of  whom \nare  predominantly  white,  and  by  denying  a  preference  to  eligible \nresidents  of  the  city of Buffalo,  a  greater proportion  of  whom  are \nminorities,  the  suburban/Belmont·  Section  8  housing  program  has \ndenied  minorities  an  equal  opportunity  for  participation  in  the \nprogram,  and  has  thus  made  housing  unavailable  to  them. \n226.  Defendants  HUD,  City  of  Buffalo,  RAC,  Town  of  Amherst \nand  Belmont  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  racially \ndiscriminatory  purpose  and  effect  of  their  Section  a-Existing \nHousing  program  policies. \n227.  Defendants  HUD,  City  of  Buffalo,  RAC,  Town  of \n~~herst \n• \nand  Belmont  have  failed  to  take  any  action  to  terminate  these \nracially discriminatory  poli~ies or  to  remedy  their effects. \n228.  As  a  result  of  the  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing \nprogram's  restricted  residency  preference,  plaintiffs  have \nsuffered  economic  and  social  injury  in  the  form  of  lost  rent \nsubsidies,  lost  educational,  employment,  health  care  and  housing \nopportunities,  the  humiliation  _of  discrimination,  and  the  denial \nof  the  benefits  of  living  in  a  racially  integrated  society. \n+ \n47 \n\n6.  Facts  with  Respect  to  Defendants•  Failures  to  Conduct \nAffirmative  Outreach  in  the  Section  8  Programs \n229.  PHAs  administering  Section  8-Existing  Housing  programs \nhave.an  obligation  to  identify  households  which,  because  of  such \nfactors  as  race  or  ethnicity,  are  less  likely  to  participate  in \nthe program,  and  a  corresponding obligation to conduct  affirmative \noutreach  to  such  households.  24  C.F.R.  §882.207. \n230.  This  affirmative outreach requirement  is coupled with an \nobligation  that  the  PHA  identify  rental  housing  in  areas  outside \nof  those  with  high  minority  concentrations  both  within  and  beyond \nthe  PHA's  primary  area  of  jurisdiction,  in  any  areas  in which  the \nPHA  is  not  legally  barred  from  entering  into  contracts,  and  to \nnotify Section 8  housing  certificate holders  and  Section 8  housing \napplicants  of  the  availability  of  such  housing.  24  C.F.R. \n§882.103  (c);  24  C.F.R.  §882.;204(b)(1)(i)(B);  24  C.F.R.  §882.209 \n(a) (4) (ii) (c). \n231.  In  addition,  occupants  of  and  applicants  for  public \nhousing  must  be  notified  by  the  Section  8  housing  program  PHAs  of \nthe  availability  of  Section  8  rental  subsidies,  SectiQn  8 \napplication  procedures  and  informed  that  applying  to  the  Section \nte \n8  housing  program will  not  jeopardize their status as  occupants  of \nand  applicants  for  public  housing.  24  C.F.R.  §882.207;  24  C.F.R. \n§882.204(b) (1) (i) (A). \n232.  Both  the  suburban/Belmont  Section  8  housing  program  and \nthe  Buffalo/RAC  Section  8  housing  program  serve  residents  of  the \ncity of  Buffalo and  include  the  city of  Buffalo within  their areas \nof  operation. \n48 \n\n233 .  Since  the  inception  of  their  respective  Section  8 \nhousing  programs,  defendants  HUD,  City  of  Buffalo,  Town  of \nAmherst,  Belmont  and  RAC  have known  or should  have  known  about  the \n• \nracially  segregated  residency  patterns  in  the  city  of  Buffalo,  in \ndefendant  BMHA's  public  housing  projects  and  in  the  suburbs \nsurrounding  the  city of  Buffalo. \n234.  Since  the  inception of the  Section  8  housing  programs  in \nErie  County,  defendants  HUD,  city  of  Buffalo,  Town  of  Amherst, \nBelmont  and  RAC  have  known  or  should  have  known  that  there  are \nsubstantial numbers  of minority households  in the city of  Buffalo, \nincluding  those  on  defendant  BMHA 1s  occupancy  and  waiting  lists, \nwhich,  without  special  outreach  and  notice  regarding  the  Section \na-Existing  Housing  programs,  would  be  unlikely  to  apply  for \nSection  8  housing  certificates  or  vouchers,  and  would  be  unlikely \nto  know  that  they  could  use  the  certificates  outside  the  city  of \nBuffalo  or  in  other  non-segregated  areas  within  the  city. \n235.  Defendants  city of  Buffalo,  Town  of Amherst,  Belmont  and \nRAC  have  failed  to  conduct  special  outreach  or  to  distribute \nnotices  regarding  the  Section  a-Existing  Housing  programs  to \nminority  families  on  defenda~t BMHA's  occupancy  and waiting  lists. \n236.  Defendants  city of  Buffalo,  Town  of Amherst,  Belmont  and \nRAC  have  failed  to  include  in  their  Equal  Opportunity  Housing \nPlans  and  Administrative  Plans  any  identification  of  BMHA \nI \noccupants  and  applicants  for  affirmative  outreach. \nI  237.  Contra=y  to  its  obligations  to  administer  its  programs \nI \nin  a  manner which  prom~tes the desegregation  of housing,  defendant \nII \nII \n49 \nI \ni \nII \n,J \n\nHUD  has  failed  to  require  defendants  City  of  Buffalo,  Town  of \nAmherst,  Belmont  and  RAC  to  conduct  affirmative  outreach  to \nminority  households  within  the  city  of  Buffalo,  including \n• \naffirmative  outreach  to  minority  occupants  of  defendant  BMHA' s \npublic  housing  projects. \n238.  Defendant  HUD  has  funded  and  continues  to  fund  Section \n8  housing  programs  in  Erie  County  which  have  the  purpose  and \neffect  of  promoting  racial  segregation  and  discrimination. \n7.  Facts  Related  To  Individual  Plaintiffs'  Section  B  Claims \n239.  Plaintiff Hazel  Grimes  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Grimes  has  resided  at  defendant  BMHA' s \nLangfield  Homes  public  housing  project  from  1966 \nuntil the  present. \nb.  During that time,  Ms.  Grimes  has never been  advised \nthat  she  could  apply  for  Section  8  rental  housing \nadministered  by  defendants  Belmont  and  RAC. \nc.  In addition,  Ms.  Grimes  has  never  been  advised  that \na  Section  8  subsidy  could  be  used  to  rent  housing \nin  areas  outsi~e  of  those  with  high  minority \nconcentrations,  either  within  the  city  of  Buffalo \nor  in the  suburbs  surrounding  the  city. \nd.  When Ms.  Grimes  has  asked  for  information regarding \nthe  Section  8  rental  housing  program,  defendant \nBMHA  has  told  her  she  is  ineligible  for  Section  8 \nrental  hou...s  ing  because  her  income  is  too  low . \n50 \n\n240.  Plaintiff Yvonne  Primm  is black. \na.  Ms.  Primm  applied  for  Section  8  rental  housing \nassistance  administered  by  defendant  RAC  in  1982. \nb.  In early 1987,  Ms.  Primm was  contacted by  defendant \nRAC  and  was  informed  that  her  application  had \nreached  the  top  of  the  Section  a-Existing  Housing \nprogram  waiting  list. \nc.  Defendant  RAC  advised  Ms.  Primm  that  she  could  be \ngiven  either  a  Section  8  certificate  or  a  Section \n8  voucher. \nd.  Defendant  RAC  advised  Ms.  Primm  that  if  she  chose \na  certificate she could only use  it within the city \nof  Buffalo,  whereas  if  she  chose  a  voucher  she \nwould  be  allowed  to  use  it  anywhere  within  Erie \nCounty. \ne.  Ms.  Primm  chose  the  Section  8  certificate  because \nit  meant  obtaining  immediate  assistance,  whereas \nchoosing  a  Section  8  voucher  would  mean  an \nadditional  wait  for  rental  housing  assistance, \nsince  there  .w,  ere  no  vouchers  available  at  that \ntime. \nf.  Because  she  is  still  interested  in  obtaining \nhousing  outside  the  city of  Buffalo,  Ms.  Primm  has \nrequested a  housing voucher  from  defendant RAC  when \none  becomes  available. \n51 \n\ng.  Ms.  Primm  has  never  been  advised  by  defendant  RAC \nthat  she  can  apply  for  Section  8  rental  housing \nadministered  by  defendant  Belmont. \nh.  In  addition,  as  an  applicant  for  Section  8  rental \nhousing,  Ms .  Primm  has  never  been  advised  by \ndefendant  RAC  of  the  availability  of  Section  8 \nhousing  in  areas  outside  of  those  with  high \nminority  concentrations,  either within  the  city  of \nBuffalo  or  the  suburbs  surrounding  the  city. \n241.  Plaintiff Matilda  Santiago  is Hispanic. \na.  Ms.  Santiago  has  resided  since  1981  in  Lakeview \nApartments,  a  predominantly  minority  occupied \npublic  housing  project  administered  by  defendant \nBMHA. \nb.  Ms.  Santiago  has  never  been  advised  that  she  can \napply  for  Section  8  rental  housing  administered  by \ndefendants  Belmont  and  RAC. \nc.  In  addition,  Ms.  Santiago  has  never  been  advised \nthat  a  Section  8  subsidy  can  be  used  to  rent \nhousing  in  outside  of  those  with  high \nar~as \nminority  concentrations,  either within  the  city  of \nBuffalo  or  in  the  suburbs  surrounding  the  city. \n242.  Plaintiff Rosetta  Weeden  is  black. \na.  Ms.  Weeden  has  resided  since  1979  in  Kenfield \nApartments,  a  minority public housing \npred~minantly \nproject  by  defendant  BMHA. \na~inistered \n52 \n\nb.  Ms.  Weeden  applied  for  Section  8  rental  housing \nassistance with  defendant  RAC  in  1979. \nc.  Ms.  Weeden  has  been on defendant RAC's  waiting  list \nfor  approximately  ten  years. \nd.  Ms.  Weeden  has  never  been  advised  of  the \navailability  of  Section  8  rental  housing  in  areas \noutside of those with high minority concentrations, \neither within the  city of Buffalo or  in the suburbs \nsurrounding  the  city. \ne.  In addition,  Ms.  Weeden  has  never been advised  that \nshe  can  apply  for  Section  8  rental  housing \nadministered  by  defendant  Belmont. \nf.  Defendant  RAC  has  informed  Ms.  Weeden  that  if  she \nreceives  rental  housing  assistance  from  defendant \nRAC  she  must  find  housing  within  the  city  of \nBuffalo. \ng.  Defendant  RAC  has  discouraged  Ms.  Weeden  from \npursuing her Section 8  housing program application, \ninforming  Ms.  Weeden  that because  she  is  alrepdy  a \npublic housing resident she should remain  in public \nhousing. \nB.  The  Community  Development  Block  Grant  Program \n1.  CDBG  Fair Housing  Requirements \n243.  Since  1975,  defendant  City  of  Buffalo  has  received  in \nexcess  of  $269  million  from  defendant  HUD  as  a  grantee  under  the \nCommunity  Development  Block  Grant  (\"CDBG\")  program. \n53 \n.. , \n__ \n\n244.  As  a  condition  to  receipt of  CDBG  funds,  a  grantee must \n\"affirmatively further  fair housing.\"  42  u.s.c.  §5304(b) (2). \n245.  Defendant  City  of  Buffalo  is  responsible  for  the \nradially  discriminatory  practices  of  defendants  BMHA  and  RAC,  as \ninstrumentalities  of  local  government  within  the  meaning  of \n§2000d-4a  of  Title VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964. \n246.  Defendant  City  of  Buffalo  has  failed  to  correct  or \nremedy  the  effects  of  the  racially  discriminatory  practices  of \ndefendants  BMHA  and  RAC,  either  through  expenditure  of  CDBG  funds \nor  otherwise. \n··  24 7.  As  a  further  condition  to  receipt  of  CDBG  funds,  a \ngrantee  must  administer  the  grant  in  conformity  with  Title  VI  of \nthe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  and  Title  VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights \nAct  of  1968,  also  known  as  the  Fair  Housing  Act  of  1968,  as \namended,  1988. \n248.  Defendant  City  of  Buffalo  has  violated  Title  VI  with \nrespect  to  the  direct administration  of  its CDBG  grant. \n249.  From  1975  to  the  present,  defendant  City  of  Buff.a lo  has \n.  . \nused  CDBG  funds  to  pay  for  all  or  part  of  ~ ts  hous~ng  code \nenforcement  program. \n250.  During  this  period,  defendant  City  of  Buffalo  has \nrefused  to  conduct  housing  code  enforcement  inspections  in  public \nhousing  projects  administered  by  defendant  BMHA. \n251.  During  this  period,  defendant  City  of  Buffalo  has \nrefused  to  conduct  housing  code  ~nforcement inspections  on \n54 \n\nproperties  in  the  Section  a-Existing  Housing  programs  located  in \nthe  city of  Buffalo. \n252.  The  resident  population  in  defendant  BMHA  administered \n• \npublic housing projects and  in Section 8  rental housing within the \ncity.of  Buffalo  is disproportionately minority. \n253.  Defendant  City  of  Buffalo • s  refusal  to  inspect  these \nproperties  has  disproportionately  affected  minorities  by  denying \nthem  access  to  the  city  of  Buffalo's  administrative  housing  code \nenforcement procedures  and  by  obstructing their access  to  judicial \nreview,  both  of  which  are  available  to  white  residents  of  the \ncity. \n254.  As  a  consequence,  minority  plaintiffs  have  been  forced \nto  reside  in housing  which  is  substandard  and  inferior to housing \navailable  to white  citizens. \n2.  CDBG  Performance  Review \n255.  The  Housing  and  Community  Development  Act  (\"HCDA\") \nrequires  that  each  recipient  of  CDBG  funds  submit,  and  that \ndefendant  HUD  review,  an  annual  performance  report.  42  u.s.c. \n§5304 (e). \n256.  The  annual  performan~e report must  specifically address \na  recipient • s  accomplishments  with  respect  to  compliance  with \nTitle  VI  and  Title  VIII,  and  the  recipient's  efforts  at  meeting \nits  statutory  obligations  affirmatively  to  further  fair  housing \npursuant  to  42  u.s.c.  §5304(b) (2). \n257.  Each  recipient of  CDBG  funds  must  conduct  an  analysis  to \nI \ndetermine  impediments  t~  fair  housing  choice  in  its  housing \nI \n55 \nI \nI· \n! \nI \n.I \n\nactivities.  24  C.F.R.  §570.904(c) (1). \n258.  A  recipient's  analysis  of  impediments  to  fair  housing \nchoice  must  include  a  review  of  its'  \"administrative  policies \nconcerning  housing  activities  which  affect \nopportunities  of  minority  households  to  select  housing  inside  or \noutside  areas  of  minority  concentration.\"  24  C.F.R.  §570.904(c) \n(1) (v). \n259.  \"When  there  has  been  a  determination  of  unlawful \nsegregation  or  other  housing  discrimination  by  a  court  or  a \nfinding  of  noncompliance  by  HUD  regarding  assisted housing  within \na  recipient's  jurisdiction,\"  the  analysis  of  impediments  to  fair \nhousing  choice  must  additionally  include  an  itemization  \"of  the \nactions  which  could  be  taken  by  the  recipient  to  help  remedy  the \ndiscriminatory  condition,  including  actions  involving  the \nexpenditure of  funds  made  available under  [the CDBG  program].\"  24 \nC.F.R.  §570.904 (c) (1) (vi). \nI \n260.  Determinations  have  been  made  by  this  Court  and  by \ndefendant  HUD  that  unlawful  segregation  and  other  housing  I \n•  I \ndiscrimination  have  occurred  with  respect  to  assisted  hou·sing  I \nI \nwithin  the  city of  Buffalo.  ~  I \nI \n261.  In  Arthur  v.  Nyquist,  this  Court  made  a  determination \nafter  trial  that,  \"[t]he  evidence  proves  that  the  residential  1-\ni \nsegregation  in  Buffalo  was  caused,  in  substantial  part,  by  the  I \nI \npolicies  and  practices  of  the  Federal  Government,  the  BMHA,  the  i \n! \nprivate real estate industry  an~ the  Common  Council  of  the city of \nBuffalo.\"  415  F.Supp.  904,  968  (W.D.N.Y.  1976). \n·• \n56 \n\n262 .  In  addition  to  its  finding  of  unlawful  segregation  and \ndiscrimination  reported  in  1970,  1983  and  1985,  defendant  HUD  on \nApril  25,  1989,  issued  a  determination  that  defendant  BMHA 1 s \n• \nadmissions  policies  from  1976  until  1985  had  resulted  in  racial \nsegregation,  and  that \"the probability that these racial  occupancy \npatterns  occurred  by  chance  is  nonexistent. \" \n263.  Defendant  HUD  has  further  determined  that  defendant \nBMHA 1 s  actions  since  1985  have  failed  to  remedy  the  resulting \nsegregation. \n264.  In  the  event  a  CDBG  recipient  fails  to  take  corrective \nor  remedial  actions  with  respect  to  correcting past violations  of \nTitle  VI  and  Title  VIII,  or  fails  to  act  in  a  manner  which \naffirmatively  furthers  fair  housing,  defendant  HUD  is  authorized \nto  adjust,  reduce,  or  withdraw  its  grants,  or  to  take  other \nappropriate  remedial  action.  42  u.s.c.  §5304(e). \n265.  In  its  annual  performance  reports,  defendant  City  of \nBuffalo has  failed to identify impediments  to fair housing choice, \nincluding but  not  limited  to,  the  racial  segregation  in  defepdant \nBMHA 1 s  public  housing  projects  and  the  geographic  restrictions \nwithin  defendant  City  of  Buffa1o 1s  Section  8  housing  programs  or \nto  itemize  actions  which  could  be  taken  to  remedy  the \ndiscriminatory  conditions. \n266.  Defendant  HUD  has  failed  to  require  defendant  City  of \nBuffalo  to  identify  impediments  to  fair  housing  choice  and  has \nfailed  to  require  defendant  City  of  Buffalo  to  remedy  those \nimpediments. \n57 \n\n267.  Despite  the  existence  of  judicial  and  administrative \ndeterminations  that racial  segregation  exists  in  defendant  BMHA's \npublic  housing  projects,  defendant  HUD  has  failed  to  require \ndefendant  City  of  Buffalo  to  identify  the  steps  it will  take  to \nremedy  this racial  segregation. \n268.  Despite  the  existence  of  judicial  and  administrative \ndeterminations  that  racial  segregation  exists  in  defendant  BMHA's \npublic  housing  projects,  defendant  HUD  has  failed  to  condition \ndefendant  City  of  Buffalo' s  CDBG  grants  upon  appropriate  remedial \naction. \nVIII.  CLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nCLAIM  1:  UNLAWFUL  SEGREGATION  AND  RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION  IN \nBUFFALO'S  PUBLIC  HOUSING  PROGRAM \n269.  Defendants  BMHA,  Grisanti,  city  of  Buffalo,  Griffin, \nHOD,  Kemp  and  Higgins  have  established,  administered,  funded, \napproved  and  failed  to  remedy  policies  and  practices  of  unlawful \nsegregation and  racial  discrimination  in  Buffalo's  public housing \nprogram,  including but  not  limited  to  the  following: \na)  policies  of  racial  segregation  from  the  inception \nof  the  public  housing  program  in  the  1930s  until \nthe present; \nb)  practices  of  racial  discrimination  in  the \nselection,  placement and transfer of public housing \ntenants; \n58 \n\nc)  racial  discrimination  in  the  site  selection, \nconversion  and  operation  of  public housing  for  the \nelderly;  and \n• \nd)  racially  disparate  levels  of  housing  quality  and \nservices  in  the  public  housing  program. \n270.  In  pursuit  of  these  policies  and  practices,  defendants \nBMHA,  Grisanti,  city  of  Buffalo,  Griffin,  HUD,  Kemp  and  Higgins \nhave  intentionally deprived  minority  plaintiffs  of  their right to \nbe  free  from  racial  discrimination  in the  making  of  contracts  and \nhave  thus  intentionally denied  them  the  full  and  equal  benefit  of \nthe  law,  as  is  enjoyed  by  white  citizens,  in  violation  of  the \nCivil Rights  Act  of  1870,  42  U.S.C.  §1981. \n271.  In  pursuit  of  these  policies  and  practices,  defendants \nBMHA,  Grisanti,  City  of  Buffalo,  Griffin,  HUD,  Kemp  and  Higgins \nhave  intentionally  deprived  minority  plaintiffs  of  their right to \nbe  free  from  racial  discrimination  in  the  leasing  of  real \nproperty,  in violation  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1866,  42  u.s.c. \n§1982. \n272.  In  pursuit  of  these  policies  and  practices,  defendants \nBMHA,  Grisanti,  city  of  Buffal~,  Griffin  and  Higgins  have,  under \ncolor  of  state  law,  intentionally  deprived  plaintiffs  of  their \nproperty  interests  protected  by  the  United  States  Constitution \nwithout  due  process  and  have  intentionally  denied  them  equal \nprotection of  the  law,  in violation of the  Fourteenth Amendment  to \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  ~s  made  actionable  by  the  Civil \nRights  Act  of  1871,  42  u.s.c.  §1983. \n59 \n\n273.  Defendants  HOD  and  Kemp  by  funding,  approving  and \nfailing  to  remedy  racial  discrimination  in  public  housing  in  the \ncity  of  Buffalo,  have  intentionally  deprived  plaintiffs  of  their \nproperty  rights  protected  by  the  United  States  Constitution \nwithout  due  process  and  have  intentionally  denied  them  equal \nprotection  of  the  law,  in  violation  of  the  Fifth Amendment  to  the \nUnited  States  Constitution. \n274.  Defendants  BMHA,  Grisanti,  City  of  Buffalo,  Griffin, \nHUD,  Kemp  and Higgins  have  denied or otherwise made  rental housing \nunavailable  to  plaintiffs,  and  have  discriminated  against \nplaintiffs  in  the  terms,  conditions  and  privileges  of  the  rental \nof  said  ~ousing,  because  of  plaintiffs'  race,  color  or  national \norigin,  in  violation  of  Title  VIII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Acts  of \n1968,  42  u.s.c.  §3604,  also known  as  the  Fair Housing Act  of  1968, \nas  amended,  1988. \n275.  Defendants  HOD  and  Kemp  have  violated  their  affirmative \nobligation  to  administer  programs  and  activities  relating  to \nhousing  in  a  manner  which  prevents  and  eliminates  discriminatory \nhousing  practices  as  required  by  Title  VIII  of  the  Civil4 Rights \nAct  of  1968,  42  U.S.C.  §§3608(d)  and  (e) (5),  by  their  continued \n6 \nfunding  and  approval  of  defendant  BMHA's  public  housing  projects \nwhile  they  were  aware,  or  should  have  been  aware,  of  the  racially \ndiscriminatory  policies  and  practices  described  above,  and  by \ntheir  failure  to  remedy  these  policies  and  practices. \n276.  By  virtue  of  their  failure  to  remedy  th~  effects  of \nracial  segregation  in  their  public  housing  programs,  defendants \n+ \n60 \n\ncity  of  Buffalo,  Griffin,  BMRA  and  Grisanti  have  violated  their \naffirmative  obligation  to  administer  programs  and  activities \nrelating  to  housing  in  a  manner  which  prevents  and  eliminates \ndiscriminatory housing practices,  as  required by  Title VIII  of  the \nCivil Rights  Act  of  1968,  42  u.s.c.  §3608. \n277.  Defendants  BMHA,  Grisanti,  city of  Buffalo,  Griffin  and \nHiggins  have  excluded  plaintiffs  from  participation  in,  denied \nthem  the  benefits  of,  and  subjected  them  to  discrimination  under \nprograms  receiving  federal  financial  assistance,  because  of \nplaintiffs'  race,  color  or  national  origin,  in  violation  of  Title \nVI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  S2000d. \n278.  Defendants  HOD  and  Kemp  have  failed  to  ensure  that  the \npublic  housing  program  in  the  city of  Buffalo  was  and  is  operated \nand  administered  in  a  nondiscriminatory  manner,  as  required  by \nTitle VI  of  the  civil Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  S2000d. \n279.  Defendants  HOD  and  Kemp  have  violated  federal  policy \nenacted  to  assure  decent  housing  and  equal  housing  opportunities \nto  all Americans  as  required  by  the  United  States  Housing  Act  of \n1937,  42  u.s.c.  §§1437,  1441  and  1441a,  and  the  Fair  Housing  Act \nof  1968,  42  u.s.c.  §3601,  et  s~g.,  by  virtue  of  their  failure  to \neradicate  racial  segregation  in  the  public  housing  program  in  the \ncity of  Buffalo. \n280.  The  acts  and  omissions  of  defendants  HOD  and  Kemp  are \nreviewable  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  5  u.s.c.  §701, \net  sea. \n61 \n\n281.  Defendants  BMHA,  Grisanti,  City  of  Buffalo,  Griffin and \nHiqqins  have,  under  color  of  state  law,  deprived  plaintiffs  of \ntheir rights  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  including  Title \nVI \"of  the Civil Rights Act  of  1964,  Title VIII  of  the Civil Rights \nAct  of  1968,  and  the  United  States  Housing  Act  of  1937,  as  made \nactionable  by  42  u.s.c.  §1983. \n282.
