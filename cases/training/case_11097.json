    "summary": "<p>In January 1972, a female inmate at the federal correctional institution at Alderson, West Virginia, filed a class action lawsuit claiming sex discrimination and a constitutional denial of equal protection against the District of Columbia Department of Corrections and the U.S. Attorney General. The class action was on behalf of all women convicted of D.C. offenses serving time in federal prisons. The Plaintiffs alleged that D.C. women were serving more time than D.C. men with similar sentences and circumstances because the women were paroled later. The Plaintiffs asked that the transfer of D.C. women to federal facilities be halted and declared unconstitutional. Clarice Feinman and Claudine SchWeber, Criminal Justice Politics and Women: The Aftermath of Legally Mandated Change, Women & Politics Vol. 4 No. 3 (Fall 1984).</p><p>The problem occurred because D.C. had no facilities for women offenders serving more than one year, so the women were sent to federal institutions located outside of D.C. As a result, the women were seen by federal parole authorities, whose release guidelines were more rigid than those of the D.C. Parole Board. Clarice Feinman and Claudine SchWeber, Criminal Justice Politics and Women: The Aftermath of Legally Mandated Change, Women & Politics Vol. 4 No. 3 (Fall 1984).</p><p>According to the D.C. Circuit in Cosgrove v. Smith, 697 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983), on December 10, 1976, the Federal Bureau of Prisons entered a consent decree in this case approved by Judge William Bryant, stipulating that all female offenders sentenced in the District of Columbia would be paroled under local, rather than federal, standards, regardless of the site of incarceration or the type of offense, be it D.C. or U.S. Code. The female inmates were to remain in federal prisons but the women were allowed to personally request transfers to the D.C. Department of Corrections \"nine months prior to their parole eligibility date.\" This was done to permit the D.C. women from federal institutions to be heard by their own parole board. The agreements was known as the Garnes Decree.</p><p>According to L. Steinitz, The Garnes Decree in Reality: Parole Eligibility and Determination for D.C. Women in Federal Correctional Institutions (1981), the Women Offenders Network (an organization sponsored by the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor) discovered in 1981 that the agreements made in Garnes were not being carried out because the D.C. Department of Corrections was not accepting transfer applications from women who had first met with the federal parole authorities and had received from them a presumptive parole date. </p><p>A hearing was held on H.R. 2050, a proposed bill to transfer parole authority to the D.C. parole board, and other bills before the Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education and the Committee on the District of Columbia House of Representatives. The bill did not pass, but on July 1, 1982, a new agreement was signed between the Federal Prison System and the D.C. Department of Corrections. The agreement was designed more precisely to carry out what Garnes had ordered. L. Steinitz, The Garnes Decree in Reality: Parole Eligibility and Determination for D.C.

Congress \nenacted this provi.c;ion in 1934 when it amended the 1932 \"Board of \nIndeterminate Sentence and Parole\" for the District of Columbia \nAct.  That act authorized indeterminate sentencing for  offenders \nconnected with crimes in the District of Columbia and created the \nDistrict of Columbia Board of Parole. \nPursuant to section 24-209, parole authority is governed by an \noffender's place of confmement. Thus, if an offender convicted of \nDistrict of Columbia offenses was confined in a Federal facility, the \nU.S. Parole Board exercised parole authority over that offender. \nLegislative hearings on this issue revealed that section 24-209 was \na major problem in the allocation of parole authority. H.R.  2050 \nevolves from this provision. Section 24-209 is both antiquated and \nambiguous. It has resulted in significant administrative and legal \nproblems. Moreover, after more than 50 years, courts have yet to \nreach a consensus about the scope of parole authority allocated by \nsection 24-209. \nThis presently existing tension is exacerbated by congressional \npassage by Public Law 98-473, the Comprehensive Crime Control \nAct of 1983, which abolished Federal parole and the U.S.  Parole \nCommission in 1991. \nIn view of congressional enactment of the District of Columbia \nSelf-Government and Reorganization Act in 1973, and the subse \nquent creation of a local government, the committee determined that \nthe District,  like States, should exercise pa:role jurisdiction over \noffenders of its laws, regardless of place of confmement. \nThis remedy would resolve existing legal disputes and facilitate \ncertain administrative problems, particularly as the present parole \nsystem affects  female District of Columbia offenders confined to \nFederal prisons. \nMERVYN M.

Code Section 24-209 vests authority over D.C. Code offenders confined in \nFederal prisons with the United States Parole Commission.  Prisoners housed in \nlocal penal facilities are subject to D.C. Parole Board Authority.  Thus,  the \nplace of a D.C. Code offender's confinement detenlllnes parole authority. Moreover, \ncourts have not yet decided 11hether Federal or District of Coltunbia parole standards \nshould be applied to parole determinations of D.C.  Code offenders in Federal prisons. \nOn its face, D.C.  Code Section 24-209 is contrary to current Federal-State \npractices.  All States which house their prisoners in Federal correctional \nfacilities retain parole authority over them.  TIl is issue is further complicated \nby the fact that all female D.C.  Code offenders sentenced to greater than one \nyear terms are confined eXClusively to Federal penal institutions. \nIn respective law suits, male and female offenders convicted ot Distri.ct of \nColumbia laws and confined to Federal correctional facilities Ilave challenged \nthe constitutionality of Section 24-209.  In January, 1972, Lana Garnes,  female \nDistrict of Columbia offender, challenged the constitutionality of the parole \nprocess.  l.ana Phoebe Garnes, et a1 v. Patricia Taylor er aI, Civil Action \nNo.  159-72 {D.D.C.  Dec.  10, 1976).  This case \\~aS settled and dismissed in \nDecember, 1976 pursuant to a stipulation cO!lIDlonly kpoHn as the Garnes Decree. \nImplementation of the Garnes Decree met numerous procedural and tecJUlical \ndiffiCUlties.  The Garnes Decree I~as finally implemented in ~Iay 1983.  Pursuant \nto the implementation agreement,  female offenders of District of COlumbia laws \nassigned to Fetleral corrections facili bes may elect to tran~fer back into \nDistrict of Columbia corrections systems within nine months of their parOle \neligibility dates.  Onc~ transferred, the District of Coltunbia Board of Parole \nexcrcisc3 parole authority over such offenders. \nIn 1980, Michael Cosgrove. on behalf of male 0 ([cntlors of District of Columbia \nlaws assigned to Federal correctional faCllities, challenged the application of \nFederal parOle guidelines to decisions of their pal·ole.  Michael Cosgrove, et al \nv. l~illiam French Smith ot al 691Fld 1125  (1983). \nOn March 31, 1981 U.S.  District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson granted \nsummary judgment to the Government.  She held that different treatment of male \nD.C. Code offenders in Federal prisons viOlated neither the U.S. Constitution \nnor the applicable statute.  On January 11, 1982 the U.S.  Court of Appeals, \nDistrict.of Columbia Circuit, reversed the District Court's grant of summary \njudgement.  The court found that the facts below were \"woefully inadequate\" to \nsupport a SU!lIDlaty judgement decision.  11le Cosgrove case was remanded, a status \nhearing has been held and trial on the issue is rending. \n\n7 \nBased on the foregoing, it is ascertainable that the problems associated with \nH.R.  3369 are its ambiguity and antiquity.  The provision's ambiguity is largely \nrelated to an absellce of clear legislative history.  The Court of Appeals stated \nthat courts have reached no clear consensus about the scope Df authority centered \nby Section 24-ZQ9:  It added \"the import of Section 24-209 is an open question \nfor us, despite-and complicated by-the fact that the statute :\\s more than forty \nyears ald.\" Cosgrove v. Smith 697 F 2d 1125, 1132 (1983).  Thus, after almost \n50 years, legislative reconsideration of Section 24-209 is required in order to \n..  resolve existing ambiguities regarding the provision's legislative intent and to \nconsider the self-governing and equity implications of the Home Rule Act of 1973 . \nGiven this background, on ~Iarch 24, 1983 Congressman Mervyn M.  Dyma11y, Walter E. \nFauntroy and George W.  Crockett introduced H.R.  2319, a bill to transfer parole  . \nauthority from the U.S. Parole Conunission to the D.C.  Parole Board, over D.C. Code \noffenders, regardless of place of confinement. \nOn ~IDY 3, 1983 the Committee on the District of Columbia, Subconunittee on Judiciary \nand Education held a hearing on !l.R. 2319.  On June 23, 1983 the Subcommittee \nfavorably reported a clean bill, ILR.  3369 to the Full Committee.  On July 25, the \nFull House of Representatives passed B.R. 3369 by voice vote.  On .July 26, 1983 \nthe bill \"as referred to the Senate, \\~here no action was taken. \nSince 1983, the parole problem has still not been fully resolved.  In this \nconnection, three recent developments influence the need for Congressional recon \nsideration of this legislation. \nOn October 12, 1984, the P:-esidcmt ~igned Public 10m, 98-473, the Comprehensive \nCrime Control Act of 1984, incorporated into a Continuing Resolution.  This 1m, \nabolishes Federal parole five yenrs after its effective date.  In the Act, \nCOJl~ress did not address t!.e implications of abolishing Federal parole on the \npCMer given to the Uniteu States Parole Commission over D.C.  Code offenders in \nSection 24-209 of the D.C. Code. \nAlso, the Act did not address the issue of which parole authority w\\1uld vest over \nD.C.  Code offenders in federal penal institutions at the expiration of ehe five \nyear period.  Unless Congress acts othendse, five years after the effective date \nof the Act, the U.S.  Parole Commission will cease to exist and there \\,ill be no \nobv iO'JS ansl,cr to this quest ion. \nSecond, consistent with Senator Spector's oversighr hearings in the 98th Congre£s \non D.C.  Parole Board reviCl, standards and Senator Spector's and the U.S. Attorney \nfor D.C. 's recommendations, the D.C.  Parole Board has appropriately revised it. • \nparoh, review standards.  TIlird, the U.S. Attorney expressed concern in 1983\" \nprior to conSidering II.R.  3369.  As stated above, the Crime Central Act is nOI, \nPublic 1.3\\;,  HOI,ever, as passed,  it does not appropriately address related D.C. \nparole issues. \nFourth, on July 15, 1985, citing massive overcrowd.l;~, U.S.  Distnct Court Judg\" \nI'lilliam B. Bryant by court order, prohibited the ci ./ from sending and ne'\" \nprisoners to the jail a~, of August 24.  On August .;1, tile judg.e agrped to deln \nthe order and the city agreed to reduce the jail poplunion by 60 persons every \ntwo weeks until November 22, 19J5 prim.'lrily by sendi ng all r.?~;l}' sentc'lt:ed \nprisoner:; to federal facilities amongst other option:>.  'i11e  .'u,.-t ~apctioned \nstipulation provided that if the jail population excecded :;oedfict· levels faT \nmore than tl;_) days, a ban on admi ttillg nel, irunates wO'lid imned,',  <y go in\":o \neffect.  TI1US,  an increased number of D.C.  Code offenders w\"lold .J.  confined in \nthe Federal penal system and become subject to i'ederal parole standards. \nSanctioned agreement provided that if the jC'il population exceeded specified \nl<)vels for !'lore than two days, a ban on admi tting net, irunates would immediately \ngo into effect.  Thus, an increased number of D.C.  Code offenders ,,,auld be \nconfined i.n the i'cdcra 1 penal system :l1ld become subject to the Federal parole \nstandards. \nGiven the above dt'velopments, Subcommittee consideration of D.C.  parole authority \nand lcgisl;ltion to correct longstanding policy and consti tutlonal concerns is \ntimely indeed. \n\n8 \nSECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS \nOF \nl:t.R,  2050 \nSection 1  l~ould amend Section 24-201(a), \"Board of Parole ..• \" to extend the \nBoard': authority over all violators of D.C. law or U.S.  laws \napplicable ~x~Jusively ~the District of Columbia, regardless of  .. \nplace of confinement. \nSection 2(1)  Would amend Scc1:ion 24-206, \"Hearing after arrest; confinement in \nnon-District institution)' by deleting subsection (6) Tegarding the \nauthority of the U.S. Parole Commission. \nSection 2(2)  Would amend Section 209 by substituting language enumerating the \nexpressed powers of the D.C.

Good morning. \nThe Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education of the Committee \non the District of Columbia is hereby called to order. \nThe hearing is convened to consider two bills: H.R. 2050 and H.R. \n3370. \nH.R. 2050 is a reintroduction of H.R. 3369, a bill introduced and \npassed by the House of Representatives in the 98th Congress. As I \nstated at our subcommittee hearing then, this bill is proposed as a \nnecessary legislative remedy to a constitutional and administrative \ndilemma. \nAt present there are over 1,400 District of Columbia Code offend \ners held in Federal Bureau of Prison facilities. Male District of Co \nlumbia Code offenders are placed in Federal facilities for selective \ncustody and  various  other reasons.  Female District of Columbia \nCode offenders sentenced to greater than I-year terms are placed \nin Federal facilities due to the absence of a facility for female of \nfenders in the District of Columbia. Most of these female offenders \nare confined at Alderson, WV, over 300 miles from the District of \nColumbia and, as I understand, a ride of about 8 hours. \nUnder present law, at section 24-209 of the District of Columbia \nCode, the place of an offender's confinement determines parole au~ \nthority. This law is contrary to current Federal-State parole prac \ntices. According to the U.S. Parole Commission, the District of Co \nlumbia is the only government housing inmates in Federal correc \ntional institutions which does not retain parole authority. This has \nresulted in the filing of several Federal lawsuits by both male and \nfemale District of Columbia Code offenders in Federal prisons. \nIn setting the tone for this hearing, several points of interest are \nin order and will be given serious scrutiny. Since our last hearing \nmore than 2 years ago,  the District of Columbia has revised its \nparole guidelines,  consistent with certain recommendations made \nby Senator Specter and the U.S. attorney for the District of Colum \nbia, Mr. Joseph diGenova. The prison overcrowding problem in the \nDistrict has resulted in an increased number of D.C. inmates being \ntransferred to Federal prisons. Further, Congress recently passed \nthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1983, which would abolish \nFederal parole and the U.S. Parole Commission in 1991. One must \nquestion the cumulative implication of these changes on the rights \nof D.C. inmates in Federal prisons. \nAlso of note, section 24-209 became law almost 50 years ago and \n40 years prior to the Home Rule Act. Its language remains ambigu \nous. For example, neither this provision nor its legislative history \nanswers  whether the U.S.  Parole Commission  should  apply D.C. \nparole standards in its parole consideration of District of Columbia \nCode offenders. Given this history, appropriate amendment would \nseem overdue. \nLawsuits filed in response to this provision remain unsolved 8nd \ncontinue to consume time and expense. This legislation provides Ii \npractical and legally sound remedy to this longstanding problem. \nH.R. 3370, the Prosecutodal and Judicial Efficiency Act of 1985, \nis a bill which evolves in large part from recommendations of the \nD.C.  Court  Study  Committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  Mr. \nCharles Rorslty, the D.C. courts and private counsel. \n\n25 \nThis bill seeks to clarify that District of Columbia Code matters \ndo not Harise under\" the laws of the United States, and District of \nColumbia Code offenders are crimes against the District of Colum \nbia, not against the United States. Additionally, it focuses on prob \nlems related to the exercise of pendent jurisdiction in the criminal \ncontext. \nWhile it does not transfer prosecutorial functions, it provides a \n..  major legal clarification in the prosecutorial  process.  Generally, \nR.R. 3370, if passed, would enhance the experience and exposure of \nassistant corporation counsels; authorize hearing commissioners for \nthe court on a permanent basis; improve judicial nomination and \ntenure commissioners procedures and other matters. \nI look forward to testimony on both these bills. At the end of the \nhearing, the subcommittee will recess and markup will take place \nsubject to the call of the Chair. \nOur first witness today is Mrs. Rolark, who has, I uD.derstand, an \nearly appointment at city hall. \nMrs. Rolark, welcome. We are most anxious to hear you. \nMrs.  ROLARK.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  morning,  Mr. \nChairman and other members of the committee. \nMr. DYMALLY.

FEMALE  DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA  CODE  OFFENDERS  SENTENCED  TO  GREATER  THAN  ONE  YEAR  TERMS  ARE \nPLACED  IN FEDERAL  FACILITIES  DUE  TO  THE  ABSENCE  OF  A FACILITY \nSPECIFICALLY  FOR  FEMALE OFFENDERS.

THI S LA~I I S CONTRARY TO  CURRENT  FEDERAL-STATE  PA'ROLE \nPRACTICES.  ACCORDING  TO  THE  UNITED  STATES  PAROLE  COMMISSION}  THE \nDISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  IS  THE  ONLY  GOVERNI1ENT  HOUSING  INMATES  IN \nFEDERAL CORRECTIONAL  INSTITUTIONS  WHICH  DOES  NOT RETAIN  PAROLE \nAUTHORITY.

SINCE  OUR  LAST \nHEARING  MORE  THAN  TWO  YEARS  AGO,  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  HAS  REVISED \nITS  PAROLE  GUIDELINES,  CONSISTENT WITH  CERTAIN  RECOMMENDATIONS  MADE  BY \nSENATOR  ARLEN  SPECTOR  AND  UNITED  STATES  ATTORNEY  FOR  THE DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA}  JOSEPH  DIGENOVA.  THE  PRISON  OVERCROWDING  PROBLEM  IN  THE \nDISTRICT HAS  RESULTED  IN  AN  INCREASED  NUMBER  OF DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA \nINMATES  BEING  TRANSFERRED  TO  FEDERAL  PRISONS.  FURTHER,  CONGRESS \nRECENTLY  PASSED  THE  COMPREHENSIVE  CRIME  CONTROL  ACT  OF  1983, WHICH \nWOULD  ABOLISH  FEDERAL  PAROLE  AND  THE  UNITED  STATES  PAROLE  COMMISSION \nIN 1991.  ONE  MUST  QUESTION  THE  CUMULATIVE  II1PLICATION  OF  THESE  CHANGES \nON  THE  RIGHTS  OF DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  INMATES  IN  FEDERAL  PRISONS. \nALSO  OF  NOTE,  SECTION  24-209 BECAME  LAW  ALMOST  50 YEARS  AGO  AND \n40 YEARS  PRIOR  TO  THE  HOME  RULE  ACT.  ITS  LANGUAGE  REMAINS  AMBIGUOUS. \nFOR  EXAMPLE,  NEITHER  THIS  PROVISION  NOR  ITS  LEGISLATIVE  HISTORY  ANSWERS \nWHETHER  THE  UNITED  STATES  PAROLE  COMMISSION  SHOULD  APPLY  DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA  PAROLE  STANDARDS  IN  ITS  PAROLE  CONSIDERATION  OF  DISTRICT OF \n~  COLUMBIA  CODE  OFFENDERS.

WILHELMINA ROLARK, MEMBER, D.C. Crry \nCOUNCIL \nMrs. ROLARK.  I am Wilhelmina Rolark, and I am a member of \nthe D.C. City Council and presently sit as Chair of the Committee \non the Judiciary of the City Council of the District of Columbia. \nI am pleased to appear before you today to offer my comments on \nH.R. 2050, which would transfer parole authority over D.C. offend \ners housed in Federal prisons from the U.S. Parole Commission to \nthe D.C. Parole Board.  . \nIn my capacity as Chair of the Committee on the Judiciary I \n...  have direct oversight authority for  the' parole board,  and conse \nquently, am keenly interested in improving the efficiency and uni \nformity of the administration of justice in the District of Columbia. \nTo that end, I fully support H.R. 2050, which will grant the D.C. \nParole Board exclusive  authority to make parole determinations \nfor all offenses committed in the District of Columbia. \nI support this legislation for  two reasons. First, the interest of \nDistrict citizens can best be protected if the legal relationship to \nthe Federal system is both consistent and well defined. Because of \nthe existing bifurcated system of criminal justice, District of Co \nlumbia Code offenders are particularly prejudiced by different Fed \neral and local standards at any stage of the criminal justice proc \ness-from bail to parole. There must be consistency and equality \nconcerning parole  determinations for  these District of Columbia \nCode offenders. The only way to ensure such is for complete parole \nauthority to be vested in the D.C. Parole Board. \nMy second reason for supporting this legislation has to do with \nhome rule. I have repeatedly stated that District officials, those of \nus who are elected and those of us who are nonelected, must decide \nwhat is  in  the  best  interest of District of Columbia  citizens.  I \nstrongly believe that all criminal justice functions should be trans \nferred to  the District including prosecutorial authority,  appoint \nment of judges, an independent jury system, and parole determina \ntions.  Indeed, H.R.  2050  is reasonable and consistent with home \nrule in that it permits the District of Columbia to finally be treated \nlike most of the 50  States that may send State code violators to \nFederal prisons. \nFurther, in the Home Rule Act, Congress did in fact delegate to \nthe District government the power to define local offenses and rati \nfied the view of the District of Columbia Code as a compilation of \nnon-Federal, State-like laws in its restructuring of the court system \nin the District pursuant to the Court Reform Act. The D.C. circuit \nhas interpreted the Court Reform Act to give local courts in the \nDistrict full responsibility for the development of the District's own \nlaw. Thus, H.R. 2050 is a confirmation of Federal legislative and \njudicial intent with regard to establishing local authority in the \ncriminal justice system. \nThe bifurcated authority that now exists regarding release of a \nDistrict prisoner on parole, termination of parole or modification of \nthe terms and conditions of parole can only result in disparate \ntreatment. There are about 1,700 male and female District of Co \nlumbia Code violators who are presently confined to Federal correc \ntional facilities. Male offenders are placed in Federal institutions \n\n30 \nfor selective custody, protective confinement and various other rea \nsons. Female offenders sentenced to terms greater than 1 year are \nplaced in Federal facilities which are located-for want of suitable \ncorrectional facilities in the Washington area-presently the ma \njority  of them  are  sentenced  to  Alderson,  which,  as  you  have \nstated, is well over 300 miles from the District. \nDistrict of Columbia offenders placed in Federal facilities, both \nmale and female, spend more time in prison than do D.C. offenders \nhoused  at Lorton,  primarily  due  to  the  different  standards for \nparole release applicable in the Federal and local systems. In the \ncase of women, the Garnes decree, enacted in 1976, was intended to \ncure this anomaly. Pursuant to that decree, once a D.C. female of \nfender  is  deemed parole eligible,  the Federal  parole  authorities \nmust review her case and send a package of materials to the Dis \ntrict authorities to determine whether she is a suitable candidate \nfor parole release. The D.C. authorities must then determine where \nher case should be heard by the D.C. Parole Board for a parole de \ncision. Often D.C. authorities rely heavily on preliminary decisions \nrendered by the U.S. Parole Commission based at Alderson. \nThe intervention of the U.S.  Parole Commission at the initial \nstage of parole evaluation, then, often results in longer sentences \nfor the women involved. This situation can only be fully remedied \nby transferring control to a single authority. \nFinally, Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I would urge this commit \ntee to consider the role of the D.C. Council and executive branch in \ndetermining the effective date of implementing a  transfer of au \nthority.  The transfer of parole functions  would certainly have a \nbudgetary impact, and we should have an opportunity to make the \nnecessary adjustments. \nMr. Chairman, I want to commend you for introducing this im \nportant piece of legislation and urge the committee to support it. \nThank you very much for this opportunity to testify. And I also \nwant to personally thank you for allowing me to come on early due \nto the fact that I must go to session. \n[The prepared statement of Mrs. Rolark follows:] \n\n31 \nSTATEMENT OF COUNCILMEMBER  WILHELMINA J. ROLARK \nBEFOPE \nTHE  HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AllD  EDUCATION \nOF THE HOUSE  CO~~ITTEE ON  THE  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nOCTOBER 1, 1985 \nGOOD  MORNING.  MR.  AND  OF THE COMMITTEE,  I AM PLEASED TO \nCHAIR~~N  ME~BERS \nAPPEAR  BEFORE  YOU  TODAY  TO  OFFER  MY  COMMENTS  OIl  H.R.  2050,  WHICH  WOULD \nTRANSFER  PAROLE  AUTHORITY  OVER  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  OFFENDERS  HOUSED  IN \nFEDERAL \"PRISONS  FROM  THE  UNITED  STATES  PAROLE  COMMISSION  TO  THE  DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA PAROLE  BOARD. \nIN  MY  CAPACITY  AS CHAIR  OF THE  COMMITTEE  ON  THE JUDICIARY  I HAVE  DIRECT \nOVERSIGHT  AUTHORITY  FOR  THE  PAROLE  BOARD,  AND  COWSEQUENTLY,  AM  KEENLY \nItlTERESTED  IN  IMPROVING  THE  EFFICIENCY AND  UNIFC!RM!TY  OF THE ADMINISTRATION  OF \nJUSTICE  IN THE  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA.  TO  THAT  END,  I FULLY SUPPORT H.R.  2050, \nWHICH  WILL  GRANT THE  DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  PAROLE  BOARD  EXCLUSIVE  AUTHORITY TO \nf/.AKE  PAROLE  DETERMINATIONS  FOR  ALL  OFFENSES  COMMITTED  IN  THE  DISTRICT  OF \nCOLUMIlIA. \nI SUPPORT  \"iHIS  LEGISLATION  FOR  TWO  REASONS.  FIRST,  THE  INTEREST  OF \nDISTRICT  CITIZENS  CAN  BEST  BE  PROTECTED  IF  THE  LEGAL  RELATIONSHIP  TO  THE \nFEDERAL  SYSTEM  IS  BOTH  CONSISTENT  AND  WELL  DEFINED.  BECAUSE  OF  THE  EXISTING \nBIFURCATED  SYSTEM  OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE,  D.C.  CODE  OFFENDERS  ARE  PARTICULARLY \nPREJUDICED  BY  DIFFERENT  FEDERAL  AND  LOCAL  STANDARDS  AT  ANY  STAGE  OF  THE \nCRIMINAL JUSTICE  PROCESS - FROM BAIL TO PAROLE.  THERE MUST BE CONSISTENCY AND \nEQUALITY  C.O NCERNING  PAROLE  DETERMINATIONS  FOR  D.C.  CODE  OFFENDERS.  THE  ONLY \nWAY  TO  ENSURE SUCH CONSISTENCY  IS FOR  COMPLETE  PAROLE  AUTHOR!TY  TO  BE  VESTED \nIN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PAROLE BOARD. \n\n32 \nMY  SEcmm  REASON  FOR  SUPPORTING  THIS  LEGISLATION  HAS  TO  DO  WITH  HOME \nRULE.  I  HAVE  REPEATEDLY  STATED  THAT  DISTRICT  OFFICIALS  - ELECTED  AND \nNONELECTED  - MUST  DECIDE  WHAT  IS  IN THE  BEST INTEREST OF DISTRICT CITIZENS. \nSTRONGLY  BELIEVE THAT ALL  CRIMINAL JUSTICE  FUNCTIONS  SHOULD  BE  TRAIISFERRED  TO \nTHE  DISTRICT  INCLUDING  PROSECUTORIAL  AUTHORITY,  APPOINTMENT  OF  JUDGES,  AN \nINDEPENDENT  JURY  SYSTEM,  AND  PAROLE  DETERMINATIONS.  INDEED,  H.R.  2050  IS \nREASONABLE  AND  CONSISTEIIT WITH  HOME  RULE,  IN THAT  IT PERMITS THE  DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA  TO  BE  TREATED  LIKE  MOST  OF  THE  50  STATES  THAT  MAY  SEND  STATE  CODE \nVIOLATOR~ TO  FEDERAL PRISONS. \nFURTHER,  IN  THE  HOME  RULE  ACT,  CONGRESS  DID  IN  FACT  DELEGATE  TO  THE \nDISTRICT GOVERNMENT  THE  POWER  TO  DEFINE LOCAL  OFFENSES,  AND  RATIFIED  THE VIEW \nOF  THE  D.C.  CODE  AS  A Ct*lPILATION  OF  NONFEDERAL,  STATE-LIKE.  i.AWS  IN  ITS \nRESTRUCTURING  OF  THE  COURT  SYSTEM  IN THE  DISTRICT PURSUANT TO  THE COURT REFORM \nACT.  THE  D.C.  CIRCUIT  HAS  INTERPRETED  THE  COURT  REFORM  ACT  TO  GIVE  LOCAL \nCOURTS  III  THE  DISTRICT  FULL  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE \nDISTRICT'S OWN  LAW.  THUS,  H.R.  2050  IS A CONFIR~'ATION OF  FEDERAL  LEGISLATIVE \nAND  JUOICIAl  HITENT  WITH  REGARD  TO  ESTABLISHIIlG  LOCAL  AUTHORITY  IN  THE \nCRIMHlAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. \nTHE  BIFURCATED AUTHORITY THAT NOW  EXISTS REGARDING  RELEASE  OF A DISTRICT \nPRISONER  ON  PAROLE,  TERMINATION  OF  PAROLE  OR  MODIFICATION  OF  THE  TERMS  AND \nCONDITIONS  OF  PAROLE  CAN  DIlLY  RESULT  IN  DISPARATE TREATMEIIT.  THERE  ARE ABOUT \n1700 MALE  AND  FEMALE  D.C.  CODE VIOLATORS  WHO ARE PRESENTLY CONFINED TO FEDERAL \nCORRECTIONAL  FACILITIES.  ~lALE OFFENDERS  ARE  PLACED  IN  FEDERAL  INSTITUTIONS \nFOR  SELECTIVE  CUSTODY,  PROTECTIVE  CONFINEMENT  AND  VARIOUS  OTHER  REASOIIS. \nFEMALE  OFFENDERS  SENTENCED  TO  TERMS  GREATER  THAN  ONE  YEAR  ARE  PLACED \n\n33 \nIN  FEDERAL  FACILITIES  FOR  WANT  OF  SUITABLE  CORRECTIDIJAL  FACILITIES  IN  THE \nWASHINGTOII  AREA.  THE  MAJORITY  OF  THESE  FEMALE  OFFENDERS  ARE  SENTENCED  TO \nALDERSON,  WEST VIRGINIA,  OVER 300 MILES FRO~I THE  DISTRICT. \nDISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  OFFENDERS  PLACED  IN  FEDERAL  FACILITIES,  BOTH  MALE \nAND  FEMALE,  SPEND  MORE  TIME IN PRISON THAN  DO  D.C.  OFFENDERS  HOUSED AT LORTON, \nPRIMARILY  DUE  TO THE  DIFFERENT STANDARDS  FOR  PAROLE  RELEASE  APPLICABLE  IN THE \nFEDERAL  AND  LOCAL  SYSTEM.  IN  THE  CASE  OF  THE  WOMEN,  THE  GARNES  DECREE, \nENACTED  IN  1976, WAS  INTENDED  TO  CURE  THIS ANOMALY.  PURSUANT TO THAT DECREE, \nONCE  A D.C.  FEMALE  OFFENDER  IS  DEnIED  PAROLE  ELIGIBLE,  THE  FEDERAL  PAROLE \nAUTHORITIES  MUST  REVIEW  HER  CASE  AND  SEND  A PACKAGE  OF  MATERIALS  TO  THE \nDISTRICT  AUTHORITIES  TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  SHE  IS  A SUITABLE  CANDIDATE  FOR \nPAROLE  RELEASE.  THE  D.C.  AU1}10RITIES  MUST  THEN  DETERMINE  WHETHER  HER  CASE \nSHOULD  BE  HEARD  BY  THE  D.C.  PAROLE  BOARD  FOR II  PAROLE  DECISION.  OFTEN  D.C. \nAUTHORITIES  RELY  HEAVILY  ON  PRELIMINARY  DECISIONS  RENDERD  BY  THE  U.S.  PAROLE \nCOMMISSION,  BASED AT ALDERSON. \nTHE  INTERVENT!ON  OF  THE  U.S.  COMMISSION  AT THE  INITIAL STAGE  OF \nPAROL~ \nPAROLE  EVALUATION,  THEN,  OFTEN  RESULTS  IN  LONGER  SENTENCES  FOR  THE.  WOMEN \nINVOLVED.  THIS SI TUATI 011  CAN  ONLY  BE  FULLY  REMEDIED  BY TRANSFERRING  CONTROL \nTO A SINGLE AUTHORITY. \nIN  CONCLUSION,  I WOULD  URGE  THIS  COMMITTEE TO  CONSIDER  THE  ROLE  OF  THE \nDISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA COUNCIL  AND  EXECUTIVE BRANCH  IN DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVE \nDATE  OF  IMPLEMENTING  A TRANSFER  OF  AUTHORITY.  THE  TRANSFER  OF  PAROLE \nFUNCTIONS  WOULD  CERTAINLY  HAVE  A BUDGETARY  IMPACT,  AND  WE  SHOULD  HAVE  AN \nOPPORTUNITY  TO  MAKE  THE  NECESSARY  ADJUSTMENTS.  MR.  CHAIRMAN,  I C~REND YOU \nFOR  INTRODUCING  THIS  IMPORTANT  LEGISLATION  AND  URGE  THE  COMMITTEE TO  SUPPORT \nn. \n\n34 \nMr. DYMALLY.  Mrs. Rolark, I have a few questions, but first let \nme join you in your wish that the entire prosecutorial system be \ntransferred over to the District of Columbia. This administration \nbelieves in local control for a number of programs, except the judi \ncial system in the District of Columbia. In that instance, they be \nlieve in the Federal system. They want to privatize the FCC, I un \nderstand, but they don't want to turn over the judicial system to \nthe District of Columbia. So I share your frustration. \nLet me ask you a question. What is the latest d~velopment re \ngarding facilities for women inmates in the District of Columbia? \nMrs. ROLARK.  There has been no change of that. It is still the \nsame. The women are still housed at Alderson, those who are sen \ntenced for more than a year. \nMr. DYMALLY. Does the city council have any plans? \nMrs. ROLARK. Well, the city council is concerned about that. I am \nparticular. We have had hearings and all the rest, but due to the \nentire-well, due to the bifurcated system in the first place, and \nthen to the entire problems that we are now having. And the fact \nthat we now have a commission that is studying the whole issue \ninvolving correctional facilities that we have placed in place  on \nthis point, we have sort of backed off. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Are you lacking in money or space or all of the \nabove? \nMrs. ROLARK. All of the above. You see, personally, you know, I \nhave the view that we do not need additional facilities} correctional \nfacilities, within the urban setting which is the District of Colum~ \nbia. I feel that this would be a misjudgment on the part of any offi-\ncial to do that.  . \nMr. DYMALLY. That was the recommendation of the commission, \nwas it not? At least the preliminary recommendation? \nMrs. ROLARK. The recommendation of the commission is for not \nprison. That is \\!orrect. They are going to the system of alterna \ntives, which I personally favor.  Because I  feel that we  have not \nreally been as innovative and exploratory as we may have in the \nconsideration of alternatives to incarceration within the District of \nColumbia. \nWe have outstanding examples throughout the United States of \nforms of alternatives that we have not even tried. \nMr. DYMALLY. Would one of the alternatives be the acquisition of \nFederal land in one of the neighboring States? \nMrs. ROLARK. Well, alternatives, the way I view it, Mr. Dymally, \nare alternatives to incarceration itself. \nMr. DYMALLY. Yes. Fine. \nIn your statement you addressed the whole question of parole \nwith reference to H.R. 2050. Do you have any views on H.R. 3370, \nor did you come prepared to respond to that? \nMrs. ROLARK. No, I didn't come prepared to respond to that. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  Can we send you  some  questions  on that, Mrs. \nRolark? \nMrs. ROLARK. Yes, you can. \nMr. DYMALLY. Fine. Thank you. \nMrs. ROLARK. And I would be very happy to respond. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Is the council in the process of considering new \nsentencing guidelines? \n\n35 \nMrs. ROLARK. Well. you know the judges of the District of Colum \nbia have a sentencing guidelines commission on which I sit, and so \ndoes  Council Chair Clark. We have been meeting regularly.  We \nhave legislation before us, but we are considering drafting of the \nlegislation but we  have backed off in view of the fact that the \njudges themselves have established-that is, Chief Judge Moultrie \nand the sentencing guidelines commission, on which both of us sit. \nWeare presently still having our meetings and considering that. \nAlso, Judge Moultrie has placed into being an alternatives com \nmission. A subcommittee of that committee deals with alternatives. \nSo you see, the courts along with us are viewing both of these mat \nters. \nMr. DYMALLY. How much time and money do you think you need \nto effect that whole transfer system? \nMrs. ROLARK. How much time? The transfer parole authority, I \nhaven't considered the time frame. But I will and let you know. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you very much. \nMrs. ROLARK. I mean. I would really have to talk with our budg \netary people. I would like to confer with our budgetary authorities \non that. \nMr. DYMALLY. Good. \nMrs. ROLARK. In order to give you an answer that would be. you \nknow, an intelligent answer considering all of the factors involved, \nthe executive as well as the legislative. But I will answer that. \nMr. DYMALLY. Has your oversight committee rendered anyopin \nion on the recently adopted guidelines of the D.C. Parole Board? \nMrs. ROLARK. No, I don't think they have considered them. They \nare getting ready to go into hearings, you know. public hearings. \nbeginning this month. But they haven't considered anything thus \nfar except the whole issue of whether a jail is in fact needed to ad \ndress the problem of overcrowding and alternatives. \nMr. DYMALLY.  What is your opinion about amending the law so \nthat D.C. violations will be brought in the name of the District of \nColumbia; in other words, it would be District of Columbia v. John \nDoe, rather than United States v. John Doe? \nMrs. ROLARK. Well, of course I agree with anything that gives us \na higher image as performing State functions, and that would do \nthat. So I agree with that. \nMr. DYMALLY. I am glad to hear you say that. Most of the people \nwe have spoken to share your view. There are some who take an \nother view based on principle. They claim that they don't want \nhalf of the cake; they want the whole cake. In other words, if they \ncan't get the whole judicial system, they just don't want it piece \nmeal. . \nOur difficulty is that-first we have difficulty getting the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice to even respond to a  letter regarding the \ntransfer. They have opposed the legislation. They have said they \nare not ready to address it,  and yet they address all the  other \nissues affecting local control of just about every conceivable scenar \nio. \nMrs. ROLARK. That is correct. There is no question. \nMr. DYMALLY.  So what we are trying to do is to see if we could \njust be as pragmatic as we can and take a  little piece here and \nthere as best we can. So your colleagues ought to know that we \n\n36 \nshare your view of a total transfer, but it is impossible under this \nadministration to do it. \nMrs. ROLARK. Yes. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Well, we thank you very much. We may have a \ncouple more questions and we  know of your rush. If so, we will \nsend them to you so that you can respond. \nMrs. ROLARK. Oh, yes. All right, then. \nMr. DYMALLY. We thank you very much for coming. \nMrs. ROLARK. And I thank you for-allowing me this privilege to \nappear before you. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Suda, and Mr. Ridley. \nWould the witnesses identify themselves for the record, please? \nMr. SUDA. My name is John Suda, and I  am acting corporation \ncounsel for the District of Columbia. \nMr. RIDLEY.  My name is Walter Ridley,  and I  am chairman of \nthe D.C. Board of Parole. \nSTATEMENTS  OF JOHN H.  SUDA,  ACTING  CORPORATION COUN \nSEL, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA; AND  WALTER RIDLEY, CHAIR \nMAN OF THE D.C. BOARD OF PAROLE \nSTATEMENT OF JOHN H. SUDA \nMr. SUDA.  Mr.  Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I \nam pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the Mayor of \nthe District of Columbia, to testify on a draft bill entitled, \"District \nof Columbia Prosecutorial and Judicial Efficiency Act of 1985.\" The \nbill  deals  with  many  different  issues,  several  of  which  would \nimpact on the quality of the District's self~government. It is to \nthese issues alone that I will address my remarks. \nThe most significant provision of this bill from a home rule per \nspective  is  section  2,  which  would  provide  that  prosecutions  of \ncriminal laws of the District of Columbia and criminal laws of the \nUnited States which are applicable solely to the District of Colum \nbia be carried out in the name of the District of Columbia rather \nthan in  the  name  of the  United  States.  However,  prosecutions \nunder these laws would still be conducted by the U.S. attorney for \nthe District of Columbia. Section 2 would further provide for the \ntemporary appointment on a rotational basis of 10 assistant corpo \nration counsels to the U.S. attorney's office, ostensibly for the pur \npose of prosecuting these offenses. \nAs this office testified before this subcommittee 2 years ago, the \ntransfer of prosecutorial and other authority related to the admin \nistration of justice from the Federal to the D.C. government should \nnot be piecemeal. That is, if the District is to be given authority \nover criminal prosecutions, over prisoners, and over the selection of \njudges, such authority should be conveyed at the same time in the \nsame bill. Of these three areas, this bill deals solely with the trans \nfer of prosecutorial authority, but does little to facilitate that trans \nfer. \nThe bill would make a purely symbolic change in the name of \nthe party prosecuting the offense. The U.S. attorney would none \ntheless retain full authority over the conduct of the prosecutions. \nAt the same time, the office of the corporation counsel would be \nexpected to augment the U.S. attorney's staff. \n\n37 \nWhile we have long encouraged measures which will lead to the \ntransfer of full authority over criminal prosecutions, this measure \nis not, in our view, a positive step toward prosecutorial autonomy \nfor the District of Columbia. Though opponents of the transfer of \nprosecutorial authority have argued that the corporation counsel's \noffice lacks the experience necessary to handle these prosecutions, \nwe  believe those objections are unfounded and that the training \nwhich is the apparent object of this bill is unnecessary. \nAs this office has written in the past to the chairman of this sub \ncommittee, the office of the corporation counsel has existed con \ntinuously,  under  a  variety  of titles,  for  over  160  years,  during \nwhich time it has handled a broad variety of legal matters: crimi \nnal, civil and administrative. Because of the unique nature of the \nDistrict of Columbia the office has functioned as a State attorney \ngeneral's  office,  as  well  as  a  municipal legal  office.  We  have a \nhighly qualified and experienced staff with attorneys from some of \nthe best law schools in the country with previous experience at \nFederal  and State government levels  and in the private sector. \nMoreover, a meaningful transfer of prosecutorial authority over se \nrious criminal offenses will require the office to increase dramati \ncally in size. Among the new hires necessitated by the transfer it is \nexpected that there would be a substantial number of experienced \ncriminal lawyers. \nIn sum, the executive branch of the D.C. government is anxious \nto continue exploring the best means of transferring prosecutorial \nauthority to the District. However, section 2 of this draft bill in our \nopinion falls short of that goal. \nSeveral other provisions  of the draft bill merit recognition  as \nbeing consistent with the goal of complete home rule for the Dis \ntrict of Columbia. Section 4 of the bill would place within the au \nthority of the D.C. courts the selection and appointment of the ex \necutive officer of the courts. At present the executive officer must \nbe selected from among individuals nominated by the director of \nthe administrative office of the U.S. courts, a Federal agency. Simi \nlarly, section 7, regarding appointments to the Board of Trustees of \nthe Public Defender Service,  would  remove from  the appointing \npanel the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia and would add the chief judge of the D.C. court of ap \npeals. \nFinally, we support section 10 of the proposed bill. This provision \nwould  establish a  mechanism by which the Supreme Court,  any \nU.S. court of appeals, or the highest court of any State might certi \nfy  to the D.C.  court of appeals controlling questions of D.C.  law. \nThis provision recognizes the highest court of the District of Colum \nbia as the primary authority on questions of D.C. law. \nIn conclusion, the executive branch of the D.C. government has \nsupported and will continue to support legislative proposals which \nfurther the goal of self-determination for the District and its citi \nzens. We cannot, however, support section 2 of this draft bill, which \npurports to move in the direction of full home rule, hut, in reality, \ndoes not further the cause of local autonomy. We support sections \n4,7, and 10 for the reasons I have outlined. We take no position on \nthe remaining provisions of the bill, which deal, in our view, with \ninternal administration of the courts and the judicial appointment \n\n38 \nprocess, except to note that section 6 has already been enacted as a \nprovision of Public Law 98-235. \nIn regard to H.R. 2050 I might add that I support H.R. 2050 on \nbehalf of the executive of the District of Columbia, and I further \nsupport the remarks that you will hear from Mr. Ridley on that \nbill. \nAgain, thank you for this opportunity to speak. \n[The prepared statement of Mr. Suda follows:] \n\n39 \nTESTIMONY OF JOHN  H.  SUDA \nACTING  CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  D.C. \nBEFORE  THE  SUBCOMMITTEE  ON  JUDICIARY AND  EDPCATION \nOF  THE  HOUSE  COMMITTEE  ON  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA \nON THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA PROSECU',LQRIAL AND  JUDICIAL \nEFFICIENCY ACT OF  J.985 \nOCTOBER  1, 1985 \nMR.  CHAIRMAN  AND  MEMBERS  OF THE  SUBCOMMITTEE: \nI  AM  PLEASED TO  APPEAR  BEFORE  YOU  TODAY  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE MAYOR \nOF  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIE,  TO TESTIFY ON  A DRAFT  BILL ENTITLED THE \n\"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  PROSECUTORIAL AND 'JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY ACT  OF \n1985.\"  THE  BILL DEALS  WITH  MANY  DIFFERENT  ISSUES,  SEVEP~L OF  WHICH \nWOULD  IMPACT ON  THE  QUALITY  OF  THE  DISTRICT'S SELF-GOVERNMENT.  IT IS \nTO  THESE  ISSUES  ALONE THAT  I  WILL ADDRESS  MY  REMARKS. \nTHE  MOST  SIGNIFICANT PROVISION  OF  THIS  BILL FROM  A HOME  RULE \nPERSPECTIVE  IS SECTION  2, WHICH  WOULD PROVIDE  THAT  PROSECUTIONS  OF \nCRIMINAL  LAWS  OF  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA AND  CRIMINAL  LAWS  OF THE \nUNITED STATES  WHICH ARE  APPLICABLE  SOLELY TO  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA \nBE  CARRIED OUT  IN  THE  NAME  OF THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  RATHER THAN  IN \nTHE  NAME  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES.  HOWEVER,  PROSECUTIONS  UNDER THESE \nLAWS  WOULD  STILL BE  CONDUCTED  BY  THE  UNITEO STATES  ATTORNEY  FOR THE \n\n40 \n- 2 -\nDISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA.  SECTION  2 WOULD  FURTHER PROVIDE  FOR  THE \nTEMPORARY  APPOINTMENT ON  A ROTATIONAL  BASIS OF  TEN  ASSISTANT \nCORPORATION  COUNSELS  TO  THE  U.S.  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE,  OSTENSIBLY  FOR \nTHE  PURPOSE OF  PROSECUTING THESE OFFENSES. \nAS  THIS OFFICE TESTIFIED BEFORE  THIS  SUBCOMMITTEE  TWO  YEARS  AGO, \nTHE TRANSFER OF PROSECUTORIAL,  AND  OTHER AUTHORITY RELATED  TO  THE \nADMINISTRATION  OF  JUSTICE,  FROM THE  FEDERAL TO THE  DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT  BE  PIECEMEAL.  THAT  IS, IF THE \nDISTRICT  IS TO  BE  GIVEN  AUTHORITY  OVER CRIMINAL  PROSECUTIONS,  OVER \nPRISONERS,  AND  OVER THE  SELECTION OF ,JUDGES,  SUCH  AUTHORITY  SHOULD  BE \nCONVEYED AT  THE  SANE  'J.'IME,  IN  THE  SAME  BIU..  OF  THESE  THREE  AREAS \nTHIS BILL DEALS  SOLELY WITH THE  TRANSFER OF  PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY, \nBUT  DOES  LITTLE TO  FACILITATE THAT  TRANSFER.  THE  BILL WOULD MAKE  A \nPURELY  SYMBOLIC  CHANGE  IN  THE NAME  OF  THE  PARTy  PROSECUTING  TqE \nOFFENSE1  THE  UNITED  STATES  ATTORNEY WOULD  NONETHELESS  RETAIN  ~ULL \nAUTHORITY OVER THE  CONDUCT OF THE  PROSECUTIONS.  AT  THE  SAME  TIME, \nTHE OFFICE  OF  THE  CORPORATION  COUNSEL  WOULD  BE  EXPECTED TO  AUGMENT \nTHE  U.S.  ATTORNEY'S  STAFF.  WHILE WE  HAVE  LONG  ENCOURAGED  MEASURES \nWHICH  WILL  LEAD  TO  THE  TRANSFER OF  FULL AUTHORITY  OVER CRIMINAL \nPROSECUTIONS,  THIS  MEASURE  IS NOT,  IN OUR VIEW,  A POSrTIVE STEP \nTOWARD  PROSECUTORIAL AUTONOMY  FOR THE  DISTkICT OF  COLUMBIA.  THOUGH \nOPPONENTS  OF  THE  TRANSFER OF  PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY  HAVE  ARGUED  THAT \nTHE  CORPORATION COUNSEL'S OFFICE LACKS  THE  EXPERIENCE  NECESSARY  TO \n\n41 \n- 3  -\nHAND~E THESE  PROSECUTIONS,  WE  BE~IEVE THOSE  OBJECTIONS  ARE  UNFOUNDED \nAND  THAT THE  \"TRAINING\"  WHICH  IS THE  APPARENT OBJECT OF  THIS  BI~~ IS \nUNNECESSARY.  AS  THIS OFFIce HAS  WRITTEN  IN THE PAST TO  THE  CHAIRMAN \nOF  THIS SUBCOHHITTEE,  THE OFnCE OF  THE  CORPORATION  COUNSE~ HAS \nEXISTED CONTINUOUS~Y, UNDER  A VARIETY  OF  TIT~ES FOR OVER 160 YEARS, \nDURING  WHICH  TIHE IT HAS  HAND~ED A BROAD  VARIETY OF  LEGA~ MATTERS \nCRIMINAL,  CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  BECAUSE  OF  THE  UNIQUE  NATURE  OF \nTHE  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE OFFICE HAS  FUNCTIONED AS  A STATE \nATTORNEY  GENERAL'S  OFFICE,  AS  WELL  AS  A MUNICIPAL  LEGAL OFFICE.  WE \nHAVE  A HIGHLY  QUALIFIED AND  EXPERIENCED STAFF,  WITH  ATTORNEYS  FROM \nSOME  OF  THE  BEST  LAW  SCHOOLS  IN THE  COUNTRY  AND  WITH  PREVIOUS \nEXPERIENCE AT  FEDERAL  AND  STATE GOVERNMENT  LEVELS AND  IN THE  PRIVATE \nSECTOR.  MOREOVER,  A MEANINGFUL TRANSFER OF  PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY \nOVER SERIOUS  CRIMINAL OFFENSES  WILL REQUIRE THE OFFICE TO  INCREASE \nDRAMATICA~LY IN SIZE.  AMONG  THE  NEW  HIRES  NECESSITATED  BY  THE \nTRANSFER  IT IS EXPECTED THAT THERE  WOULD  BE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER \nOF EXPERIENCED CRIMINAL LAWYERS. \nIN SUM,  THE  EXECUTIVE  HRANCH  OF  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA \nGOVERNMENT  IS ANXIOUS  TO  CONTINUE  EXPLORING THE  BEST MEANS  OF \nTRANSfERRING PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY  TO  THE  DISTRICT.  HOWEVER, \nSECTION 2  THIS  DRAFT  BILL FALLS  SHORT OF  THAT GOAL. \nSEVERAL  OTHER  PROVISIONS OF THE  DRAFT  BILL MERIT RECOGNITION  AS \nBEING  CONSISTENT WITH  THE  GOAL OF  COMPLETE  HOME  RULE  FOR THE  DISTRICT \nOF COLUMBIA.  SECTION  4  OF  THE  BILL WOULD  PLACE  WITHIN  TdE AUTHORITY \nOF  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  COURTS  THE  SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF \n\n42 \n- 4 -\nTHE  EXECUTIVE  OFFICER OF  THE  COURTS.  AT  PRESENT THE  EXECUTIVE \nOFFICER MUST  BE  SELECTED  FROM  AMONG  INDIVIDUALS  NOMINATED  BY  THE \nDIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE  UNITED STATES  COURTS,  A \nFSDERAL AGENCY.  SIMILARLY,  SECTION  7, REGARDING  APPOINTMENTS  TO THE \nBOARD OF  TRUSTEES  OF THE  PUBLIC  DEFENDER SERVICE,  WOULD  REMOVE  FROM \nTHE APPOINTING  PANEL THE CHIEF JUDGE OF  THE  UNITED STATES COURT  OF \nAPPEALS  FOR THE DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA AND  WOULD ADD  THE  CHIEF JUDGE  OF \nTHE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  COURT OF APPEALS. \nFINALLY,  WE  SUPPORT SECTION  10 OF  THE  PROPOSED BILL.  THIS \nPROVISION  WOULD  ESTABLISH  A MECHANISM  BY  WHICH  THE  SUPREME  COURT,  ANY \nUNITED STATES  COURT  OF APPEALS,  OR  THE  HIGHEST  COURT  OF ANY  STATE \nMIGHT  CERTIFY TO  THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  COURT OF APPEALS \nCONTROLLING QUESTIONS  OF  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA  LAW.  THIS PROVISION \nRECOGNIZES  THE  HIGHEST COURT OF THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA AS  THE \nPRIMARY  AUTHORITY  ON  QUESTIONS  OF  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA LAW. \nIN  CONCLUSION,  THE  EXECUTIVE  BRANCH  OF THE  DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA \nGOVERNMENT  HAS  SUPPORTED AND WILL  CONTINUE  TO  SUPPORT  LEGISLATIVE \nPROPOSALS  WHICH  FURTHER THE  GOAL  OF  SELF-DETERMINATION  FOR THE \nDISTRICT AND  ITS CITIZENS.  WE  CANNOT,  :iOWEVER,  SUPPORT SECTION  2 \nOF  THIS  DRAFT  BILL,  WHICH  PURPORTS TO  MOVE  IN THE  DIRECTION OF  FULL \nHOME  RULE,  BUT  IN  REALITY  DOES  NOT  FURTHER THE  CAUSE  OF LOCAL \nAUTONOMY.  WE  SUPPORT SECTIONS  4,7, AND  10  FOR THE REASONS  I \nHAVE  OUTLINED.  WE  TAKE  NO  POSITION ON  THE  REMAINING  PROVISIONS  OF \nTHE  BILL,  WHICH  DEAL  WITH  INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION  OF  THE  COURTS  AND \nTHE  JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT  PROCESS,  EXCEPT TO  NOTE  THAT  SECTION  6 HAS \nALREADY  BEEN  ENACTED  AS  A PROV1S!ON  OF  PUBLIC  LAW  98-235. \nAGAIN,  THANK  YOU  FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. \n\n43 \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Suda? \nMr. SUDA. Yes? \nMr.  DYMALLY.  In other words,  what if we  took out section  2, \nwould that make you happy? \nMr. SUDA.  No, Your Honor, section 2 does not make me happy \nfor several--. \nMr. DYMALLY. What if we eliminated it? \nMr. SUDA. If you eliminated section 2, you would have a bill that \nin my judgment cleans up several problems currently in regard to \nthe administration of the local court system and I would support \nthe bill. \nMr. DYMALLY. You don't like the idea of the corporation counsel \ngoing over to the U.S. attorney's office? \nMr. SUDA. No, Your Honor, I do not. I do not. \nMr. DYMALLY.  All right. Let us take that under advisement be \ncause we certainly want a bill that would make the city happy. We \ndon't want something that you are going to be fussing about. \nMr. SUDA. '?\"hank you. \nMr. DYMA1 ..L  Y. Minority counsel? \nMr. HAMM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \nMy name is Ron Hamm, minority staff assistant. \nMr.  Suda, I  found  your  testimony very  enlightening.  I  would \nhave a couple of questions for you, though. \nDoes  the  corporation counsel  currently have  the  authority to \nwork with the U.S. attorney and delegate its attorneys to them on \nneed? \nMr. SUDA. No. I would like to explain what the corporation coun \nsel's office does do now basically because I think you will see that \nour jurisdictions meet at one point, and where they meet there is a \nlot of cooperation between the two offices. They meet principally \nactually in two areas. \nThey meet in the criminal area because we handle the prosecu \ntion of all juveniles except those that are designated for adult trial. \nWe  also  handle  the prosecution of misdemeanors,  minor  misde \nmeanors, in the District of Columbia. And very frequently there is \na charge that is our charge and simultaneously a charge that is the \nU.S. attorney's charge, at the same time. In those cases there is no \nquestion but that there is a great deal of cooperation between the \nUnited States and the District of Columbia. \nIn the civil area there is another point at which my office and \nthe office  of the U.S.  attorney very frequently  collaborate,  and \nthat is  in regard to  issues, mostly law enforcement issues,  that \narise in civil lawsuits. The jurisdiction of the office of the corpora \ntion counsel in regard to civil lawsuits is complete. It is quite like \nan attorney general's office; and we are sued as frequently as any \nState is sued, and we are certainly sued as frequently as any city is \nsued. \nWell, very frequently, in light of the law enforcement situation \nin the District of Columbia, the United States is simultaneously \nsued in the same lawsuit. In those cases there is very close touch \nbetween my office and the U.S. attorney's office. \nI have been in the corporation counsel's office for 20 years. Most \nof my time has been spent heading up the civil division, and that is \nwhy I feel it is necessary to emphasize that the ties between my \n\n44 \noffice and the U.S. attorney's office in the civil area are very strong \nand have been for as long as I have been in the office. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Mr. Suda and counsel, may we just proceed with \nMr. Ridley, and probably we could take the questions together. I \nmay have erred in not proceeding directly. \nMr. Ridley? \nSTATEMENT OF WALTER RIDLEY \nMr. RIDLEY. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and other committee \nmembers. I am pleased to appear before you today in support of \nbill H.R. 2050. This bill conforms with the District's goal of achiev \ning full  autonomy  and will  significantly  improve  our ability to \nmanage the criminal justice system. While we will ask for some \nmodification of the bill and have not decided upon the most feasi \nble operating procedure, we look forward to working with this com \nmittee, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Parole Commission \nto  assure  efficient  and equitable  treatment of District prisoners \nhoused in Federal institutions from transition through full imple \nmentation of these changes in parole procedures. \nThe criminal justice system in the District is complex. The parole \nfu.nction is no exception to the fact. The District currently has ap \nproximately 1,800 prisoners located in 33 different Federal prisons \nin 23 different States across the country. We expect a continual in \ncrease in the number of D.C. offenders given Federal designations \nover the next year or so while the District expands its institutional \ncapacity. Furthermore, some of the Federal prison locations, where \nDistrict of Columbia Code violators are housed, are as distant as \nCalifornia and Texas, thus requiring tremendous transportation ex \npenditures in order to either bring the prisoners to the D.C. Board \nof Parole or transport parole board members and staff to various \nFederal prisons. \nIn assessing the most feasible way of implementing this legisla \ntion the District has identified four options: \nFirst, to transport prisoners to the District of Columbia 6 to 9 \nmonths prior to their parole eligibility date for a  hearing before \nthe board; \nSecond,  to transport D.C.  Parole Board members and staff to \neach of the Federal institutions housing D.C. prisoners on a prede \ntermined schedule for the purpose of conducting hearings; \nThird, combine (1) and (2) above by establishing regions based on \nthe geographic distribution of prisoners where hearings will be con \nducted on a predetermined schedule by transporting both prisoners \nand parole board personnel to those locations; and \nFourth,  by requesting the U.S.  Parole Commission  to  conduct \ncourtesy hearings of D.C.  Code violators using D.C. parole guide \nlines for making reJRase decisions and forwarding relevant infor \nmation to the Di~,tdct's .yarole Board for the actual rendering of \nthe release decision. \nCurrently, we ar~ assessing the scope of responsibility and cost of \nimplementing each of these options. Many factors must be consid \nered and successful transition and operation of this transfer of au \nthority will require the continued cooperation and support of the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Parole Commission. \n\n45 \nAlthough cost projections have not been finalized, we estimate a \nneed for at least $1 million in additional funding to the District for \nthe first year if Option 2-transporting parole board personnel to \neach Federal prison-is adopted.  Option 3 would be slightly less \ncostly, depending upon the regional configuration used, but would \ncreate additional work for the U.S. Marshal Service and Federal \nBureau of Prisons in transporting and housing prisoners at desig \nnated regions. In summary, this transfer is going to require addi \ntional funding, and we ask that the bill be amended to allow for an \nincremental assumption of cost by the District. \nAlso, since implementation of this legislation will require exten \nsive planning with local and Federal agencies, we need a transition \nperiod of 2 years, rather than 1, as currently contemplated by this \ncommittee. This will enable us to establish an automated informa \ntion system interfaced with the Federal prisons and other affected \nagencies to ensure a safe and orderly process for making parole re \nlease decisions for D.C. prisoners housed in Federal institutions. \nIn conclusion, Mr.  Chairman, and committee members, we  ap \nplaud your action of furthering the objectives of home rule by this \nlegislative initiative. We look forward to receiving responsibility for \nmaking parole release decisions for all D.C. Code violators and will \nimmediately proceed to develop a viable parole transfer plan after \nthis legislation has been adopted. \nI will be happy to entertain questions. Thank you. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you, Mr. Ridley. \nFirst, I want to congratulate you on your recent appointment \nand welcome you to the committee. \nMr. Suda wants to do some mathematics here. He wants a minus \nand you want a plus. Both of them I find very intriguing and not at \nall totally objectionable. So you want a  million dollars  and Mr. \nSud a wants section 2 out. The subcommittee will take that under \nadvisement. \nBut let me switch just a moment here and talk to you about the \nwhole question of parole and housing of inmates. Does the District \nof Columbia send any of its inmates up to Petersburg? \nMr. RIDLEY. Yes, we do, sir. \nMr. DYMALLY. I had occasion, Mr. Ridley, to go to Petersburg re \ncently. It took me a whole day to go there. I drove; stopped and got \nsome orange juice on my way up, stopped and got some lunch. It \nconsumed 1 entire day.  I  asked my staff who  traveled with me \nwhat happens to poor families who have to visit inmates there? \nBut more significantly, what about the right of the inmate to coun \nsel? I mean, it seem~ to me a major hardship not only in getting to \nAlderson. And Ald0cson, I have been threatening to go to Alderson \nfor 5 years; and every time I put on my calendar, \"visit to Alder \nson\"-and the next one is proposed for  October 13  and 14-my \nstaff tells me it is a 2-day visit. Because I can't get a morning plane \nhere and come back in the evening the same day. That is really an \noutrage. Something really ought to be done about it. \nI have been very quiet; I haven't gone and held press conferences \nand done something about it. But the fact that I had to sacrifice an \nentire day-it wasn't a  sacrifice, really; it was an experience. It \nseems to me that we really ought to be doing something about this \nsituation. \n\n46 \nAnd now I see District of Columbia is uncertain about this whole \nquestion of facilities. I am referring not only to District of Colum \nbia; I am referring to the Federal system, although we don't have \nany Federal representatives here. \nPeople who are just seeking bail are sent all the way to Alder \nson, have to be transported back here for 8 hours, wait for a public \ndefender, and are sent back up to Alderson again. That is really \nmefficient. I am just beginning to get involved with the system. I \nhave been sort of an observer, kind of a 3-day resident of the Dis \ntrict. I go back home every weekend. But I know of some personal \ninstances where the Federal Government has people in Alderson \nand Petersburg without bail. They don't have a right to effective \ncounsel that way. A lawyer has to give up an entire day. A public \ndefender is not going to do that sort of thing, anyhow. I am just \nventing my irustration. \nWhat are we doing about this situation, Mr. Ridley? You want a \nmillion dollars; give me some good answers. \nMr. RIDLEY. I would like to turn that response over to Mr. Suda, \nChairman Dymally, since he is more familiar than I. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  All right,  both of you.  Both of you are on the \nfiring line. \nMr. Suda, if you want section 2 out, give me some good answers. \nMr. SUDA. No, no. Mr. Chairman, first of all, in regard to the pre \ntrial detainees that were going to Petersburg, that through an ar \nrangement that we have worked out with the U.S. attorney's office \nhas ceased; From about August 22 to last week, all persons who ap \npeared in front of the U.S. District Court-for the District of Colum \nbia were held at Petersburg. We have stopped that. They are now \nbeing held in the D.C. jail. So the only persons who should be in \nPetersburg as of this time are those persons who have been convict \ned already on a charge and have been sentenced. All pretrial de \ntainees are now back up in the District of Columbia. \nThe situation obviously is a very complicated one caused by our \novercrowded prison institutions here in the District of Columbia. \nEach one of our L\"'1stitutions is now over capacity. The D.C. jail is \nstill over capacity in spite of the Judge Bryant decree. The central \nfacility-all of the Lorton facilities are over capacity. And our half \nway houses  are over capacity. Because of this overcrowding the \nFederal  Government  has  continued  to  take  convicted  and  sen \ntenced persons to Federal institutions to help ease the overcrowd \ning situation, and also to help the District of Columbia meet the \nlines drawn by the Judge Bryant order in terms of getting the \nnumbers of persons at the D.C. jail down to 1,694 by November 22, \n1985, which is now just roughly a month and a half away. That \ncomplicates it. \nSo there is more here than just the ability to try to reach an \nagreement to bring people back to the District of Columbia. Howev \ner, I am pleased to say that in regard to pretrial detainees that sit \nuation has been worked out and they are now being housed at the \nDistrict of Columbia jail. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Suda, I am an unreconstructed home ruler. I \nmean, I believe in home rule 1,000 percent. But on this particular \nissue, and I have basically supported everything, I just got to tell \nyou, you may anticipate some legislation from me next year if the \n\n47 \nDistrict of Columbia does not expedite the whole problem of hous \ning of women inmates who are not sentenced someplace that is con \nvenient for counsel. \nYes, after they are sentenced society believes, and I don't share \nthat necessarily, that criminals in prisons have no rights. But de \nfendants have rights, and they ought not to be subject to this sort \nof inconvenience. \nI have been your friend for the last years. I am just going to tell \nyou something: If I have to spend 2 days to go up to Alderson, you \ncan expect some-unless you get some special charter for me to \ncome  back the same day,  you can expect some legislation next \nyear. I am warning you. OK? \nMr. SUDA. I think the situation at Alderson is a very bad one. I \nagree with you on that. \nMr. DYMALLY. It is just an outrage. \nTo what do you attribute the high incarceration and recidivism \nrates for the District of Columbia? Both of you, Mr. Ridley and Mr. \nSuda. \nMr. RIDLEY. I will try first, Mr. Chairman. The District of Colum \nbia right now has a very serious drug abuse problem. In addition to \nthat, the District of Columbia has probably one of the better law \nenforcement components in the United States, using modern tech \nnology and,  of course,  increased numbers. Therefore, the arrest \nrate is much higher than it is in most urban areas. \nThe high recidivism rate is a little complex for me because there \nare so many different ways that you can measure recidivism. One \nof the things we look at is the drug problem, and a large percent \nage, as I understand from the statistics I have read, are those who \nhave been involved in the possession and sale or distribution of \nsubstances. Therefore, I think that contributes to our large recidi \nvism. \nMr. DYMALLY. Do you think the unique system, or should I say \nthe unusual system of dual parole that you have here, with the \nFeds and the District, may cause some of that problem? \nMr. RIDLEY. In the compilation of the statistics it very well could, \nMr. Chairman. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Could you give us a brief review of your new re \nvised guidelines and how they operate? \nMr. RIDLEY. Yes, sir. \nMr. DYMALLY. And if it is lengthy, then could you submit a copy \nfor the record? \nMr. RIDLEY. I will, sir. \nIn the last 12 months the District of Columbia Board of Parole \nenacted  several  significant  rule  changes.  The  first  set  of  rule \nchanges concerned the establishment of specific criteria for the is \nsuance of parole violator warrants and for rendering parole revoca \ntion decisions. These rules changes greatly reduce the degree of dis \ncretion in :lecislonmaking by parole board members and brought \nDistrict policies in this area in line with other jurisdictions. \nThe second significant rule change concerns the establishment of \nempirically based parole decisionmaking guidelines.  These guide \nlines were designed to ensure uniformity in parole decisionmaking \nand to ensure that public safety considerations are systematically \nincluded in all aspects of parole decisionmaking. \n\n48 \nThe D.C. parole guidelines consist of several measures which ex \namine: One, likelihood that parolee will commit other crimes; two, \nhistory of commiting violent crimes; three, history of violations of \ndrug laws; four, institutional adjustment; and five, program partici \npation. \nThe measure used to specifically assess risk is the salient factor \nscale, which is the risk assessment component of guidelines used by \nthe U.S. Parole Commission since 1974, and has a strong empirical \nfoundation. The salient factor scale has been validated and revali \ndated as a reasonably accurate predictor of risk in several .3tudies \nusing samples of Federal prison releasees. The salient factor scale \nhas been used by the D.C. Board of Parole since April 1985, and \nsome of the areas covered by this measure include: criminal histo \nry, institutional history, age, and history of drug use. Over time it \nis expected that use of this measure and the remaining components \nof the District's guidelines system should facilitate parole decision \nmaking greatly reducing the risk to the public at large. \nMr. DThIALLY. The U.S. attorney disagrees with you, and claims \nthat the high recidivism rate in the District of Columbia is due to \nlax parole guidelines. \nMr. RIDLEY.  Mr. Chairman, in April 1985, we implemented the \nnew guidelines. Therefore, I am sure the U.S. attorney has not had \nan opportunity to assess the validity of the new guidelines, sir. \nMr. DYMALLY. If this legislation were passed here in the House \nand signed by the President, how much time do  you think you \nwould need to put it into effect? \nMr. RIDLEY. I would request 2 ye:;rrs, sir. \nMr. DYMM,:uY. Two years? \nMr. RIDLEY. Yes, sir. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Suda, I don't want to influence the decision of \nthe Advisory Commission on Site Selection, but I certainly would \nlike to express my concern about this question of inconvenience of \nfamilies of poor inmates who are not yet sentenced. So at some ap \npl'opriate time, if it could be arranged, I would like to talk with the \nChair of the committee about this problem, so that they will under \nstand there is a need to make some decision about this site selec \ntion speed. \nMr. SUDA. Yes; 1 would be very happy to do that. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you. Do you agree with the legal basis for \nthe proposal to require criminal cases to be brought in the name of \nthe District of Columbia? \nMr. SUDA. Yes; I do. \nMr. DYMALLY.  You heard my comment to Mrs. Rolark. I share \nyour view that you should get the whole ball of wax, and this ad \nministration in my judgment has been very hypocritical about this \nquestion of local home rule by wanting to give Medicare and Social \nSecurity and everything to the private sector or State or local gov \nernment, but not the criminal justice system to the District of Co \nlumbia. But in the meantime, this is the best we can do. \n\n49 \nWe have some questions which we plan to mail to both of you for \na further response, so we can enter it into the record with the hope \nthat it will convince the Senate to pass this piece of legislation this \nyear. \n'Il1ank you very much. \nMr. SUDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n[The questions and answers submitted follow:] \n\n50 \nResponses of Mr.  Walter B.  Ridley,  Chairman \nDistrict of Columbia Board of Parole to \nQUestions posed on October 1, 1985 by the \nSubcommittee on Judiciary and Education \nQuestion: \n1. Por the record, Mr.  Ridley,  can you just give a mild \ndescription of the parole review process under both the \nDistrict of Columbia and how it is similar or distinct \nfrom the federal parole system? \nAnswer: \n1. The District of Columbia Board of Parole has adopted a  set \nof structured formal parole guidelines.  The  use of formal ~ \nparole decision-making guidelines at parole initial hearings \nand rehearings is a  step toward a  more  coherent parole \ndecision-making process that will lead both to increased \nconsistency in parole release decisions al\"?  enhanced \naccountability of the Board.  These guidelines reduce the \ndegree of subjectivity prevalent in past parole decisions, \nand make  explicit those factors to be considered in each \nindividual case.  The guideline model used is dynamic, \nrequiring an ongoing data collection, and  feedback mechanism \nto provide the content and/or structure of the guidelines \nover time. \nThe major objectives of Using formal parole guidelines are: \n1)  Promoting consistent parole deciSion-making; \n2)  Making the paroling policies more explicit; \n3)  Incorporating a  concern for fairness; \n4)  Achieving the sentencing purposes of incapacitation, \nspecific det~rrence, and rehabilita~ion1 \n5}  Penalizing institutional misconduct,  and \n6)  Peveloping an evolutionary model of management control. \nThere are three principles underlying the parole guidelines. \nThe first principle is that the parole decision-making \nprocess shOUld be based on offender characteristics that have \na  statistically determined bearing on the offender's risk of \nfuture involvement in criminal behavior.  The second princi \nple is that the court addresses the purposes of retribution and \ngeneral deterrence,  through tbe sentence it imposes, and tbp. \nBoard of Parole will not usurp these functions of the sentenc \ning judge.  A third principle is that in determining the factors \n\n51 \n-2-\nAnswer  to Question 41  Continued \nused as components of the guidelines, consideration should be \ngiven to their fairness and to their statistical reliability. \nThe  overriding principle of the guidelines is that they \nshould allow for release of a parolee only when information \nindicates that there is a  reasonable probability that an \nindividual will live and remain at liberty without violating \nthe laws and that such xelease is not incompatible with the \nwelfare of society. \nThe guidelines ;are~omprised of four factors: \n1)  Degree of risk as determined by calculation of the \nSalient Factor Score, an actuarial risk assessment \ndevice; \n2)  Type of risk that distinguishes between violent crimes, \nweapons,  or drug trafficking and other less serious \ncrimes; \n3)  rnstitutional adjustment as determined by disciplinary \ninfractions/or lack of while incarcerated; and \n4)  ?rogram participation as measured by the degree of \nparticipation in ~rison programs by the inmate. \nThe guidelines we.re modeled,  in part, after those used by  the \nU.S.  Parole Commission and the state of Pennsylvania.  The \nguidelines are empirically based with a numerical SCore \ndetermined byiirst .. calculating a Salient ;Factor .Score  {risk \nassessment).  rlrhisscore places the 'offender ~nto one of £our \nrisk categories • •- A :.baseline ..numb.er .of :.points :is .assigned .to \neach risk category. ·.·..For ;.each.Df .:.tbe:other ~ac.toIs :for .;which \nan affirmative..:£inding ~s made ,;points .:are;added ~r \nsubtracted from the baseline score.  The  resnlting pOint \ntotal determines whether or not parole is granted, and  if so, \nthe level of supervision to be imposed.  The Board members \nmay  override a  guideline recommendation if there are \nmitigating or aggravating circumstances. Decisions that \noverride guideline recommendations must be clearly \ndocumented. \n\n52 \n-3-\nQuestion: \n2.  Could you provide a  brief review of the Parole Board's \nrevised guidelines? \nAnswer,: \n2. The guidelines encompass state of the art techniques for \ndecision-making and set basic standards for parole super \nvision levels.  These guidelines draw from the experiences \nof two model  systems:  the u.s. Parole Commission and the \nstate of Pennsylvania.  They  incorporate results of fourteen \nyears of research at the federal level and  include the \ncollective thinking of District officials and local, state \nand federal experts in the field.  We  chose the state of \nPennsylvania because its guidelines contain both pre- and \npost-incarceration factors such as ours. \nThe District of Columbia Parole Board is statutorily mandated \nto consider parole eligibility within the context of the \nprisoner's conduct within the  institution, the probability a \nnew  crime will not be committed;  and the general welfare of \nsociety. \nSpecific factors considered by  the Board of Parole include: \noffense severity; prior criminal record; personal and social \nhistory; physical and emotional health;  institutional \nadjustment,  including success at combating problemsj  and \navailability of community resources for transition from \nprison. \nThe  Parole Board has been guided in its decisions by these \nfactors.  However,  up  to now,  there was no  systematic way  to \ncombine these factors  in a manner  to ensure reliable decision \nmaking that also specifically took the predicted risk of \nfuture criminal involvement into account. \nEven  though our past parole decision-making criteria have \nincluded many  of the same  factors enumerated in the new \nguidelines, we  will now  attach specific numerical values to \neach factor.  Also the risk assessment factors we will use \nhave been statistically validated. \nIn developing these guidelj,iles, our major  thrust was  pro \ntection of the public, especially from persons who  commit \ncrimes of violence,  with weapons,  and whose  crimes involve \ndrugs,  including PCP.  Our  guidelines specifically include \neac:h  of these serious acts as negative parole indicants and \ninclude a  numerical score to predict risk to the community. \n\n53 \n-4-\nAnswer  to Question i2 ~ontinued \nUnder  the new guideline system four factors are considered \nwith numerical values attached to each of (che  factors. These \nfactors are: degree of risk that is posed by an offender if \nreleased;  type of risk that distinguishes bet.ween violent \ncrimes, drug trafficking and other less serious crimes; \ninstitutional adjustment,  and program participation, as \nmeasured by degree of participation in prison programs.  A \ncomposite score is derived, based on how each offender is \ncalculated on:aach of the £our £actors, and a  guidelines. \nrecommendation..:is ±hen .:determined.  In any instance where  the \nParole Board :choses -to :-override -;tbe '\"guideline recommendation, \nthe reason must be clearly .documented. \nWe  have included participation in educational and vocational \ntraining programs as enhancing factors in the guidelines. \nIn other words, while high risk, serious offenders will serve \nlong sentences,  sustained achievement will be  recognized as a \npositi'!·e factor  in calculating the guidelines score. \nIn summary,  the. result of these changes in parole release \ndecision-making  is that higher quality decisions will be made. \nThe goal is to incarcerate high risk offenders who may  pose a \ndanger  to the community.  The goal for low risk offenders who \nwork  hard while incarcerated to improve themselves is to be \nparoled at their initial hearing. \nI  have included a  copy of Amendment No.  1  to the District of \nCOlumbia Municipal Regulations Title 28  Corrections, Courts \nand Criminal Justice which includes Procedures for Granting \nParole for your  information. \nQUestion: \n3.  In your opinion ,how will :.the .abolishment of federal \nparole effect_~e.~nterests·~nd Iights ~f D.C.  Code offenders \nin federal prisons? \nAnswer:  . \n~would deny the D.C.  offender the same parole rights \nafforded D.C. offenders housed under  the jurisdiction of the \nDistrict of Columbia.  In addition the impact of the \nabolishment would  in my opinion severely impede  the babilitative \nopportunities afforded the same  offenders. \n( \n\n54 \n-5-\nQuestion: \n4. Recidivism is quite high in t~e District of Columbia;  ~hat \ndo you attribute this to and how does it compare with other \nmajor urban  jurisdictions? \nAnswer: \n~idivism is not only quite high in the District of \nColumbia but also nationally.  According to the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, approximately 61 percent .of those \nadmitted to state prisons in 1979 were  recidivists  (prior \nadmission to prison).  Of  those entering prison without a \nhistory of incarceration  (an estimated 39 percent of all \nadmissions), 60  percent had prior convictions that resulted \nin. probation and an estimated 27  percent were on probation at \nthe time of their prison admission. \nDefinitive data on recidivism in the District is not avail \nble.  However,  it is estimated that the proportion of \nDistrict sentenced offenders with prior incarcerations \napproximates national figures. \nThe reasons for high recidi'Visr.: both J.ocally and nationally \nare probably nUmeroUs.  The  lack of effective prison reha \nbilitation programs,  inadequate post-release supervision, \ndrug abuse,  and  chronic high unemployment among  segments of \nthe population are some  of the often cited reasons for \npersons returning to prison. \nQuestion: \n5. The  united States Attorney's Office attributes high \nrecidivism rate ir.  the District to laxed parole standards; \nwhat is your  respons~ to this contention? \nAnswer: \ns:-AIUniform operational definition of recidivism does not \nexis.t.  In a  generic sense,  it refers to an established \npattern of individuals violating laws.  Based upon current \nmethods for compiling and analyzing criminal justice data, \nthe District's general indicator of recidivism is the number \nof persons rearrested while in some  type of pre or post trial \nrelease program. \n\n55 \n-6-\nAnswer  to Question i5 Continued \nSince January of 1983,  the percentage of arrestees for seri \nous crimes, who  are processed through the court cellblock, \nhas  ranged from 20  to 27  percent.  Of those numbers, which \naverage 15,700,  approximately 27  percent were in post trial \nrelease programs including probation and parole. A note \nworthy fact about all rearrests is that a majority,  ranging \nfrom 55  to 64  percent, were for drug law violations. \nIt is also important to note t.bat probation is the most \nwidely used program for which post trial rearrest statistics \nare compiled. \nNationally, parole i.s  the second major form of community super \nvision for adjudicated offenders.  Although some prisoners \nare released to the community unconditionally, approximately \n75  percent are released to parole supervision.  Parolees \naccount for approximately 11 percent of all adults in the \nUnited States under some  form of correctional supervision. \nThe percentage of persons rearrested in the District who  were \non  parole ranged from four  to eighteen percent, on  a quar \nterly basis since 1983. \nReported crime in the District has daclined for  the past \nthree years.  We  attribute much  of this to improved technol \nogy and enhanced law enforcement techniques which  incorporate \ntechnological advancements. \nCorresponding improvements have been made  in parole decision \nmaking.  Recognizing the need to curtail some  of the subjec \ntivity in parole decision-making, the District recently \nadopted empirically based guidelines.  Some  type of decision \nmaking guidelines for parole exist in all jurisdictions, with \nthe degree of explicitness and the range of flexibility varying \nto a  large extent.  Factors for consideration in parole \ndecision-making are simply listed in some  jurisdiction.  In \nothers,  they are listed and prioritized in terms of importance, \nwhile in other  jurisdictions, detailed guidelines are linked \nto rating scales and computational formula are utilized to make \ndecisions. \nThe District's parole release standards are among  the most \nstringent in the country.  They emphasize aggravating factors \nsuch as criminal histories of offenders and severity of the \nlnst,ant c.f.fense,  and place less emphasis  on  tradit.ionally \nmitigating factors such as participation in instit.utional \nprograms.  Additionally,  we  have very stringent procedures for \nrevoking parole and  immediately intervene when parolees test \npositive for drug  use or fail to comply with other conditions \nof release such as maintaining employment. \n\n56 \n-7-\nQuestion:  . \n6. Administratively speaking,  if this legislation passed, how \nwould your office conduc~ parole hearings over the numerous \noffenders in the federal system and to what extent would you \nhave to increase the number  of parole officers? \nAnswer: \n~ave addressed part of this question in my  earlier \ntestimony. \nIn assessing the most feasible way of implementing this \nlegislation, the District has identified four  options: \n(1)  To  transport prisoners to the District of Columbia \nsix to nine months prior to their parole eligibility \ndate for a  hearing before the Parole Board~ \n(2)  To  transport D.C.  Parole Board members  and staff to \neach of the federal institutions housing D.C.  pris \noners on a  predetermined schedule for the purpose of \nconducting  hearings; \n(3)  Combine 1 and 2 above by establishing regions  (based \non 'che geographic distribution of prisoners)  where \nhearings will be conducted on  a predetermined schedule \nby transporting both prisoners and Parole Board \npersonnel to those locations; and \n(4)  By  requesting the U.S.  Parole Commission to conduct \ncourtesy hearings of D.C.  Code violators, using D.C. \nparole guidelines for making decisions, and forwarding \nrelevant information to the District's Parole Board for \nthe actual rendering of the release decision. \nCurrently,  we  are assessing the scope of responsibility and \ncost of implementing each of these options.  Many  factors \nmust be considered and successful transition and operation of \nthis transfer of authority will require the continued coopera \ntion and support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and U.S. \nParole Commission \nAlthough cost projections have not been finalized, we  esti \nmate a  need for at least one million dollars in additional \nfunding  to the District for  the first year  if Option 2 \n(transportirtg Parole Board personnel to each federal prison) \nis adopted. \n• \n\n57 \n-8-\nAnswer  to Question 16 Continued \nOption 3 would be slightly less costly, depending upon the \nregional configuration used,  but would create additional work \nfor the U.S.  Marshal Service and Federal Bureau of Prisons \nin transporting and housing prisoners at designa~ed regions. \nIn summary,  this transfer is going to require additional fund \ning and we  ask that the Bill be amended to allow for an \nincremental assumption of cost by the District. \nQuestion: \n7. What  is your parole officers present caseload and how \nwould it be changed by this legislation? \nAnswer: \n7. The present parol(~ officers case ratio is 1  to 65  for youth \ncases and 1  to 88  fOl:  adults.  This caseload includes active, \ninactive and warrant issue cases. \nParole supervision is currently a  function of the Department \nof Corrections. \nThe Board of Parole has ~ecently established a  staff team to \nstudy the feasibility of a proposed reorganization which \nwould transfer responsibility for parole supervision to the \nBoard of Parole. \nThere will be an increase in the number of cases but it will \nnot be a major  impact because all D.C.  Code offenders housed \nin federal prisons will not have the same parole eligibility \ndates nor will they be heard by the Board at the same  time. \nThe problem could be addressed by the addition of a  few \nparole officers. \nQuestion: \n8. If the Congress passed this legislation, how much  time \nwould you  reqUire before taking over their functions? \nAnswer: \n8. Since implementation of this legislation will reqUire \nextensive planning with local and federal agencies, we  need a \ntransition period of two years. \n\n58 \n-9-\n~uestion: \n• Has your office conducted a  statistical analysis of the \nparoles granted over the last few years, based on the \ncharacter and nature of the offense, and the respective \nsentence imposed? \nAnswer: \n9. The  D.C.  Office of Criminal Justice Plans and Analysis \nin conjunction with the D.C. Board of Parole, engaged in a \nresearch project, funded by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nto test the applicability of the Iowa Risk Assessment Scale \nwith the Distric.t' s  parole population. \nThis device was  selected for analysis because it contains a \n-risk of violenceft  classification in addition to general risk \nclassification scheme.  Research  involved a  statistical \nanalysis based on  follow-up of a  retrospective sample of 581 \nDistrict of Columbia parolees released during CY  1980. \nVariables in this analysis included criminal history, \nparole performance history,  drug use history, and other \nsocio-demographic items. \nFindings from this analysis indicated that the Iowa Risk \nAssessment Scale failed to satisfactorily predict parole \nperformance.  It is determined that this device is inapplicable \nto D.C.  parolees. \nUsing the same CY  1980 parolee popUlation sample,  the Salient \nFactor Score was  tested for its applicability to the \nDistrict's parolee population. \nThe Salient Factor Score is a  risk assessment tool developed \nand used by the U.S.  Parole Commission.  This risk assessment \nmeasure was  developed and validated on samples  (i.e., those \nincarcerated in federal facilities).  This scale has also \nbeen subjected to two separated reliability studies which \nresulted in the refinement of its items and the instructions \nof Bcoring as reliability enhancements. \nTO  determine whether the Salient Factor Score differentiated \nadequately for D.C.  parolees, salient factors scores were \ncalCUlated from data for 402  of the parolees released in the \nDistrict of Columbia in CY  1980.  The  scores were  then \nexamined  in relation to parole outcomes as defined by revoca \ntions, new convictions, technical violations, and parole \nwithout incident.  Findings from this analyses suggested that \nthe Salient Factor Scale could indeed differentiate, with Borne \n\n59 \nAnswer  to Question 19 Continued \naccuracy,  those parolees likely to have parole revoked from \nother parolees.  However,  it should be noted that due to \nlimitations  in the data base and  in sampling procedures, \nthese findings were viewed as strictly .preliminary with \nfurther validation studies required overtime. \nIn addition' to these two  studies which were conducted in \nconjunction with the devclupment process for parole \nguidelines, the District's Department of Corrections issues \nannual reports on parolee performance,  and includes data on \nparole socio-demographic characteristics. \nOnce  the planned automated parole management information \nsystem is established, then more  refined research may  be done \nwhich could more clearly delineate those variables linked to \nparole success and consequently improve  risk.assessment devices. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Polansky? Mr. Polansky, it is good to have you \n·.[?,ack again. \nSTATEMENT OF LARRY P. POLANSKY, EXECUTIVE OFFICER, D.C. \nCOURTS \nMr. POLANSKY. It is my pleasure, sir. It is my pleasure to be here \non behalf of Judge Moultrie, who was invited to testify, but I will \ntestify on behalf of the D.C. courts, sir. \nI would like to speak to those sections of the proposed bill which \naffect  the  courts  directly,  and I  will  suggest some  amendments \nwhich the courts believe are extremely important. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  Mr.  Polansky, I  take it you have those amend \nments in writing? \nMr. POLANSKY. Yes; we have provided a copy to staff of the pro \nposed amendments to section 3. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you. \nMr. POLANSKY. In fact, we thank you for section 3 which would \nmake our hearing commissioners a permanent feature of the supe \nrior court operation. We have had them in operation for 3 years, \nand they have been a  very important part of our operation. We \nwould ask, however, for some amendment to section 3 that would \nexpand the authority of the hearing commissioners sufficiently to \neliminate bottlenecks that have developed in those 3 years. \nThere is a requirement in the current act for the consent of the \nparties in order to permit the hearing commissioner to determine \nconditions of release or to hear a probable cause hearing. Well, this \nat times will create a delay in that a judge must be brought from \nan active courtroom to respond to the nonconsent of the parties. \nThis also places a restriction on a hearing commissioner which is \nnot placed on a U.S. magistrate, which is surprising since our stat \nute is modeled upon that Magistrate Act. \nOn the other hand, it is our belief that in the actual trial of cases \nthe consent of the parties should be required; however, the require \nment that the findings of the commissioner would result only in a \nrecommendation to a judge again creates delay in the operation of \nthe court. It is our opinion that once the parties have consented to \nbe heard by the hearing commissioner it would be appropriate to \npermit  the  rendering  of a  final  judgment,  subject,  however,  to \n56-728 0 - 86 - 3 \n\n60 \nreview by a judge of the trial court upon proper motion made by a \nparty.  In our  opinicn,  the simple  amendments  suggested would \nresult in significant benefit to the operation of the court. \nSection 4 of the act that you propose is part of our legislative \npackage that we have previously submitted, and we certainly sup \nport that. \nWe respectfully suggest that section 5, which would repeal total \nly the automatic disbarment provisions of the District of Columbia \nCode,  be  reviewed for  amendments which would specifically ad \ndress any problem that the committee sees.  We strongly believe \nthat conviction for an offense involving moral turpitude does  re \nflect upon a lawyer's right to be an officer of the court, and would \nask that you carefully review section 11-2503 of the District of Co \nlumbia Code before acting with a broad brush to repeal the entire \nsection. \nSection 6 is a technical change regarding retirement age that in \nfact was  passed in a  previous  year.  But I  must admit that we \nmissed the fact that there was a section of the act that was not cor \nrected, and this is a required technical amendment. \nI have no comment on section 7 regarding the board of trustees \nof the public defender's service. \nWe would also respectfully submit that the proposed section 8 \namendment is not totally necessary. One part asks that the author \nity of the auditor-master to audit and state a specific fiduciary ac \ncount be removed and that authority be provided for the register of \nwills. I  would bring to your attention that de facto that has oc \ncurred; and the second part, to provide the authority for the regis \nter of wills formally, is appropriate. Removing that authority from \nthe auditor-master might, in fact,  hurt in that any judge of the \ncourt can delegate to the auditor-master any case, and this might \npreclude the delegation of a probate matter for the auditor-master. \nSection 9 of the act is part of our court package, and it takes care \nof the  duplicate  reporting requirement placed on D.C.  judges. I \nwould commend this section highly, and would indicate to you that \nJudge  Tamm-recently  deceased  Judge  Tamm-publicly  an \nnounced that he did not understand why the D.C. judges were re \nquired to report to the Federal Commission. \nSection 10, although not commented on by the District of Colum \nbia courts in their legislative package, regarding the certification of \nState questions of law, we believe is a  commendable addition to \nthis bilL \nSections  11  to  14,  regarding the D.C.  Nominating and Tenure \nCommission, we decline to comment on. \nSection 15, however, which would eliminate the category of ex \nceptionally well qualified, is a warranted and I think very desirable \nchange to the act. The distinction between well qualified and ex \nceptionally well qualified does  not help in any fashion and does \ncreate some tension among judges who are qualified in one or the \nother of those categories. \nWe  are pleased that you have included in this omnibus court \npackage several of the proposals that were in the court's legislative \npackage which we forwarded to the members of the committee ear \nlier this year. We would, however, ask that you consider additional \namendments recommended by the Joint Committee on Judicial Ad-\n\n61 \nministration and by the judges of both courts that would provide \nfor sabbatical leave for judges, would correct a gross mistake made \nin. the statutory language which controls the calculation of survi \nvors' annuities, and change the methodology for the provision of \ncompensation  of senior  judges  without  changing  the maximum \nannual salary they might earn. \nLast but not least, we would ask that you review the statute re \ngarding the limitation of D.C. judges' salaries to 90 percent of Fed \neral judges' salaries. We  believe there is proper justification for \nthat to  be changed to  an  equivalent salary to  that of Federal \njudges. \nWe  have  attached  to  the  prepared  testimony which  we  will \nsubmit a copy of that previously submitted legislative package, and \nwould, at this time, stand ready to answer any questions you might \nhave. \n[The  prepared  statement  and  attachment  of  Mr.  Polansky \nfollow:] \n\n62 \nTestllrony of Larry P: Polansky \nExecutive Offider ~ District of Columbia Courts \nbefore the \nJudiciary and Education Sulxx:mnittee \nof the \nHouse of Representatives \nComtittee 00 the District of Colurrbia \nChainnan Dymally and nanbers of the Judiciary and Educatioo \nsulxx:mnittee of the Comtittee on the District of Colurrbia;  it is my pleasure \nto be here today to testify 00 behaL{ of the District of Colurrbia Courts \nregarding the proposed District of C(llunbia Prosecutorial and Judicial \nEfficiency !\\at. ~f '1985: \nI will speak en those sections of the proposed bill which affect the \nDistrict. of Colmnbia Courts directly and will suggest sore additional amend \nrrents which the Courts believe are ext.rerrely irrportant to their effective \noperation: \nWe thank you for Section 3 ..m1.ch will rrake cur bearing cannissioners \na permanent feature of the Superior Court operation.

Mr. Polansky, you touched on two very technical \nthemes and,  as a layperson, I want you to explain the language \nwhich you read, and I quote: \"Commission's ... 'exceptionally well \nqualified' category.\" What do you mean by that? \nMr. POLANSKY. In the evaluation of a sitting D.C. judge for recer \ntification for  an additional 15-year term,  the tenure commission \nhas several categories which it can classify. One-it could say that \nthe judge is \"not qualified,\" at which point the judge may not be \nreappointed.  The tenure commission  may say that the judge is \n\"qualified,\" which then would lead to the ability of the President \nto  rename that judge, but there is no  automatic renaming. The \nthird category is  \"well qualified,\" which would call for the auto \nmatic renaming of that judge for another I5-year term. In addition, \nthere  is  a  fourth  category called  \"exceptionally well  qualified,\" \nwhich results in the same decision as <lwell qualified,\" and the only \nresult that it has is to give you a weighting of how wen qualified \none judge is as compared to the other. I would say that it performs \nin many senses a disservice in publicly making a distinction that \nreally makes no difference. \nMr. DYMALLY.  You also mace reference to \"tensionsl/-tensions \namong judges? \nMr. POLANSKY. Yes; it has a feeling of one judge sitting next to \nanother judge who certainly feel that they both are doing a proper \nand fine  and appropriate job,  and one being \"exceptionally well \nqualified\" and carrying a certain halo that the next door neighbor \ndoes not carry. I would submit that it really has no meaning, and it \ncan only cause hard feelings among the members of the bench. \nMr. DYMf..LLY. Now could you elaborate on your comment regard \ning section 5? Can present court of appeals standards protect the \nbar and the community adequately? \nMr. POLANSKY.  Well, I think it does.  However, there was a ra \ntionale  when the Court Reorganization Act was implemented to \nprovide for the automatic disbarment for the conviction of a crime \nof moral turpitude.  Now perhaps that is overreaching.  However, \nthe total repeal of that mayor may not have an effect on the limits \nof the ability of the court to act. I would personally submit, not on \nbehalf of the court, that I feel that there is a value, although there \nmay be parts of that particular section of the D.C. Code which over \nreach. And I would recommend highly a looking at that section to \nsee if there are parts of it that need revision, rather than the total \nabolishment of that section. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  Mr.  Polansky,  as  usual,  we  have some  written \nquestions which we shall forward to you for a response. \nMr. POLANSKY. I would be glad to respond, sir. Thank you. \nMr. DYMALLY.

CLARKE, CHAIRMAN \nCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nBEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND EDUCATION \nOF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nOCTOBER 1, 1985 \nChairman Dymally and members of. the Subconuni ttee, thank you for \nthe  opportunity  to  offer testimony on H.R.  2050,  which addresses \nparole  authority  over  District of Columbia prisoners and on H.R. \n3370,  the  \"District  of  ColUl!1bia  Prosecutorial  and  Judicial \nEfficiency Act of 1985\". \nH.R. 2050 \nH.R.  2050 would give the District of Columbia Board of Parole \nexclusive  authority  over  all parole matters concerning prisoners \nconvicted of D.C.  Code offenses or of any laws of the United states \napplicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.  The effect of \nthe  legislation would  be  to  transfer  parole  authori ty  over  D. C \nprisoners housed in federal correctional facilities from the Uni ted \nStates  Parole  Conunission  to  the  District  of  Columbia  Board  of \nParole.  This  bill would  expand  the  authority of the District of \nColumbia government and is consistent with our goals of attaining \ntrue Home Rule.  However,  I am concerned that H.R. 2050 not be viewed \n\n72 \nas a  substitute for the much broader plan of granting judicial and \nprosecutorial autonomy to the District. \nH.R.  2050 addresses only one segment of the District's criminal \njustice system -- the parole function.  In the past this Committee \nhas considered legislation which would have  transferred authority \nover almost all facets of the District's criminal justice system to \nthe  District of  Columbia  government.  While I  recognize that the \nReagan  Administration  has  opposed  the  plan  for  judicial  and \nprosecutorial autonomy,  I  continue to hope that Congress will not \nlose sight of the need for a comprehensive transfer. \nIn order to successfully accomplish the transfer of authority \ncontemplated by H.R.  2050,  it will be necessary for the District of \nColumbia  Government  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  for \nimplementation.  There a several options available for implementing \nthe  transfer.  I  am  pleased  to  see  that the  bi 11  provides  the \nPi strict  with  the  necessary  flexibility  to  determine  which \nprocedure  to  adopt.  It  is  also  helpful  that  the  current  bill \ncontains a delayed effective date provision.  The inclusion of this \nprovision will permit time for the District to adjust its budgetary \nplanning in order to take into account the additional costs which \nwill be occasioned by the em.ctment of H.R. 2050. \nWhile the new effective date provisions are helpful, Section 4 \nof  the  bill relating to  the  applicability of the legislation is \ntroublesome.  Paragraph  (b)  of  Section 4  clarifies that the U.S. \nParole Commission is to retain parole authority over prisoners who, \nprior to the effective date of this legislation,  received unified \n2 \n\n73 \nsentences for violations of both District of Columbia law and United \nStates law.  Paragraph (a) provides that after the effective date of \nthe legislation, persons convicted of both District and federal code \noffenses  are  to  receive separate and distinct sentences for  such \nconvictions.  It  is unclear  under this provision,  however,  which \nparole board would have autho:t:\"ity over a prisoner in this situation. \nIf the intent of this prOVision is to have the prisoner subject to \nboth the District of Columbia Board of Parole and the United states \nParole  Commission  for  the  separate  convictions  (perhaps  for \noffenses arising out of a  single incident),  this would seem to be \nunduly difficult.  It would be helpfUL if this section was revised to \nclarify that these prisoners a:t:\"e  to be  subject to only one parole \nboard. \nTo  conclude,  while  I  view  E.R.  2050  as promoting equity and \nfairness within the D.C. criminal justice system by providing that \nall D.C.  prisoners will be subject tc the same parole autho:t:\"ity and \nwill be judged according to the same standards,  I  would prefer that \nthis transfer of authority be made in the context of a much broader \ngrant of prosecutorial and judicial autonomy. \nH.R. 3370 \nH.R.  3370,  the \"District of Columbia Prosecutorial and Judicial \nEfficiency  Act  of  1985\",  contains  a  variety of provisions which \nwould impact upon the administration of jUstice in the District of \nColumbia.  Hany cf the legislative changes proposed in the bill are \nnecessary in order to implement some of the recommendations made in \n3 \n\n74 \nthe  District of  Columbia Bar's study of the District of Columbia \ncourt system,  commonly referred to as the Horsky Committee Study. \nFor  the  most  part,  these  proposals  can  only  be  accomplished by \namendments  to  either  the  Home  Rule  Charter  or  Title  11  of  the \nDistrict of Columbia Code,  both of which the Council is prohibited \nfrom amending. \nr  note,  hO\\olever,  that  this  bill does point to a  reoccllrring \nproblem.  Even the simplest matters relating to the administration \nof justice in the District of Columbia must be brought before the \nCongress of the United States if a  change.to Title 11 is required \nbecause the local legislature lacks the authority to address them. \nr hope that in the near future Congress \\oIil1  consider lifting the \nlimitation which  prohibits  the Council from enacting legislation \nwi th respect to Title 11. \nSeveral of the bill's provisions are troublesome.  Section 2 (a) \nof the bill provides that criminal offenses are to be prosecuted in \nthe name of the District of Columbia by the United Sta<tes Attorney. \n!  stronglY oppose this provision of the bill.  This section does not \nenhance  or  strengthen  Home  Rule.  It represents a  change in name \nonly.  If  true  Home  Rule  is  to  be  accomplished  a  change  in \nprosecutorial  authority is needed,  not just a  change in name.  In \naddition to the Home  Rule implications,  I  find it objectionable to \nhave an official acting in the name of and on behalf of the District \nof Columbia who is neither elected by the citizens of the District of \nColumbia  nor  selected by those entrusted by the public with that \nresponsibility.  I  strongly urge  the Subcommittee to delete this \nprovision from the bill. \n4 \n\n75 \nParagraghs  (b)  and  (c)  of  Section  2  are  also  troublesome. \nParagraph (b)  limits the joinder of D.C. Code and U.S. Code offenses \nin a  single indictment and appears to remove the authority of the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to act on any D.C. \nCode offense which may be joined with aU. S. Code offense. Paragraph \n(c)  is  a  conforming  amendment  Which  provides  that prosecutions \naffected by this section will not abate.  These prOVisions do little \nin terms of achieving greater Home Rule for the District.  It would \nappear,  however,  the provisions may work a  tremendous hardship in \nterms of the efficient administration of justice.  Consequently,  I \nrequest that you not enact this provision. \nParagraph (d)  of Section 2 would require that the United states \nAttorney  provide  annual  reports  to  the  Mayor  and  the  Council. \nUsually, a reporting requirement such as that contained in paragraph \n(d),  is written into the law in order to assist the Council fulfill \nits  oversight  responsibilities  with  respect  to  the  reporting \nagency.  In this case, provisions of the Home Rule Act specifically \npreclude  the Council from  acting on the information.  Thus,  while \nthis  information  would  be  ext.:emely  useful  and we  would greatly \nappreciate  receiving  it,  what  the  District  really  needs  is \nprosecutorial autonomy. \nParagraph (e)  of Section 2  would require that the Corporation \nCounsel detail assistants to the Uni ted states Attorney's Office and \nthat the United states Attorney accept their services. The benefi ts \nof a  such a  training program are many and I  offer my support for this \ntype of program.  I  am concerned, however, that the mandatory nature \nof this provision weighs heavily on the Office of the Corporation \n5 \n\n76 \nCounsel.  The  Office  of  Corporation  Counsel  is  an agency of the \nDistrict of Columbia Goverrunent and it should be the responsibility \nof  the  local  goverrunent,  not  the  Congress,  to determine how the \nagency should operate and how its resources should be used.  If it is \ndetermined that legislation is necessary to establish or maintain \nthe exchange program,  it might be more in line with the spirit of \nHome  Rule  for  Congress to exel-cise its authority to regulate the \nOffice of the United states Attorney by simply requiring that the \nOffice make  the program ava~lable to assistants of the Corporation \nCounsel's  Office.  r  am  also concerned that care be taken in the \ndrafting  and  imrlementation  of this section so  as to ensure that \nassistants  of  the  Corporation Counsel's Office are not placed in \nconflict-of-interest situations since the Corporation Counsel and \nthe Uni ted States Attorney represent different enti ties. \nSection 11 of the bill amends provisions of the Home  Rule Act \nwhich relate to the JUdicial Nominations Commission.  The amendment \nwould  limit  access  to materials furnished to or developed by the \nCommission.  The  limitation  sought  in this provision of the bill \ncould be accomplished by an amendment to the District's Freedom of \nInformation Act.  Amendment of this Act is a  responsibility of the \nCouncil  as  was  its  enactment,  and,  if the  JUdicial  Nominations \nCommission presents this issue to the Council,  r  am  sure it would \nreceive a fair review. \nOne  proposal  that was  recommended as part of the legislative \namendments  needed  to  implement  the  Horsky  Committee  Study was  a \nproposal to give authori ty to the Council to periodically adjust the \nsmall claims ceiling.  This proposal wall not included in the bill and \nI  recommend  its  inclusion.  As  you  are  aware,  Congress recently \nraised the small claims jurisdiction for Superior Court f):\"om $750 to \n$2,000.  This was the first incl;.\"ease in a 14 year period.  It might be \nadvantageous to delegate the authority to make such adjustments to \nthe Council so that we might be able to review of the SUfficiency of \nthe ceiling as the need arises. \n'l'hank you for the opport\\.lni ty to share these comments with you. \n\n77 \nMr. DYMALLY.

C 20530 \nSEP  ~ 7 1985 \nHonorable Ronald Dellums \nChairman \nCommittee on the District of Columbia \nU.S.  House  of Representatives \nWashington, D.C.  20515 \nDear MI'.  Chairman: \nThis is irt response to your request for the views of the \nDepartment or Justice on H.R.  2050,  a  bill \"to give to the Board \nof Parole of the District of Columbia exclusive power and author \nity to make  parole determinations concerning prisoners convicted \nof violating any law or the District or Columbia,  or any law or \nthe United States applicable exclusively  to the District.\"  As \nset forth in more detail below,  the Department of Justice believes \nthat the change sought by  this bill would not improve the law en \nforcement and  corrections programs  in the District of Columbia and \nwe  ther(\"fore oppose this bill.  Furthermore,  we  believe that \nCongress should not undertake piecemeal revisions of the D.C. \ncorrections  programs until completion or a  thorough and  com \nprehensive review of all sentencing and correctional practices. \nAt  present under the D. C.  Code,  the determination 01'  par.ole \njurisdiction 1s controlled by the place or incarceration rather \nthan the jurisdiction of conviction.  The  result is that the D.C. \nBoard of Parole makes  parole decisions for D.C.  Code  orfenders \nwhen  they are housed  in D.C.  institutions and the United States \nParole Commission ~akes parole decisions ror D.C.  Code of renders \nwhen  they are housed in rederal institutions.  At  the present time \nover 1,400 D.C.  Code offenders are held in Federal Bureau of Pri \nsons  facilities.  This represents the designed capacity of three \nmodern eorrectional institutions.  Although some of these are in \nfederal custody because of their extremely violent criminal his \ntorie.s or to separat.e tl:em from other District of Columbia in \nmates,  the bulk of thfim are in federal custody primarily because \nof shortages of space to houae inmates in the District of Columbia \nsystem.  ThUS,  two factors not addressed in H.R.  2050  are  the real \nburden to the Federal Bureau of Prisons of confining this large \ngroup of local offenders and  the serious problems involved in \nadding these geographicallY dispersed inmates to the D.C.  Parola \nBoard's aaseload. \n\n78 \nHonorable Ronald  Dellums \nli.H.  2050 ..  P,age  2 \nIn the 193Q's when the D.C.  Board or Parole was  established, \nthis divided Jurisdictional scheme may have met correctional \nneeds.  The  Comprehensive Crime Control Act or 1983 abolishes the \nUnited States Parole Commission in 1991, however,  and legislative \nattention must clearly be given to the questions or future parole \nrespons1bility \"ell' D.C.  Code  orrenders designated to Federal 1n \nstitutions.  At  the same time every errort must be made  to 1nsure \nthat the District or Columbia will provide adequate prison space \nto house its sentenced criminals. \nA larger question is what  role should parole serve as a  cor \nrect10nal tool in the District of Columbia?  The  legislative his \ntory of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 198~, P.L.  98-~73, \nclearly reflects the Congre~sional determination that the \"rehab \nilitation model\" upon which the Federal sentencing and  parole sys \ntem was  based is no  longer valid.  S.  Rep.  No.  225,  98th Congress \n1st Sess.  38  (1983).  Based upon a  study spanning a decade con \nducted by the National COD~lssion on  Herorm of Federal Criminal \nLaw,  it was  concluded that the Federal sentencing and parole sys \ntem  resulted in significant disparities in criminal sentences.  As \nstated in the Senate Report: \nThe shameful disparity in criminal sentences is a  major \nflaw in the eXisting criminal justice syste~, and makes  it \nclear that the system is ripe ror reJ:orm.  Correcting our \narbitrary and  capricious method of sentencing will not be a \npanacea ror all of the problems which conJ:ront the adminis \ntration or criminal justice, but it will constitute a  sig \nnificant step forward. \nThe  [Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  (CCCA)] \nmeets  the critical challenges of sentencing rerorm.  The \n[CCCA's]  sweeping provisions are designed  to structure \njudicisl sentencing dis~retion, eliminate indeterminate \nsentencing, phase out parole release,  and make  criminal \nsentencing fairer and more  certain.  The  current effort \nconstitutes an important attempt to reform the manner in \nwhich we  sentence conVicted orfenders.  The  Committee \nbelieves that the [CeCA]  represents a major breakthrough in \nthis area.  ~.  at 65. \nThe current D.C.  sentenCing and parole system does not reflect \nthis new  understanding or the limitationp, of the  \"rehabilitation \nmodel\" as described sbove. \n\n79 \nHonorable Ronald  Dellums \nH.R.  2050 - Page 3 \nIn addition, the District o£ Columbia parole system has other \ndemonstrated problems.  When  we  reviewed similar legislation two \nyears ago  [H.R.  3369J,  this matter was  discussed in detail in our \nletter dated July 25,  1983 £rom  Assistant Attorney General Robert \nA.  McConnell  to you.  The Depa['tment noted at that time that the \nD.C.  Board o£ Parole,  according to its 1982 annual repo['t,  granted \nparole at initial hearings to 61%  o£ the adult o£1'enders and  that \n73%  of the remainder were granted parole upon a  rehearing.  The \nBoard also reported however,  that based upon a  study of a selected \nsample of 322 parolees released on parole between 1977 and 1979, \n52%  were  re-arrested during the first two  years of parole super \nvision.  Of  the parolees who  were  re-arrested,  77%  were convicted \n£or crimes committed while on parole.  Given the very high per \ncentage of parolees released at the time of initial parole con \nsideration and  the very high rate of recidivist criminal activity \namong  those released,  the policies and procedures of the D.C. \nBoard of Parole were  called into serious question. \nWe  also pointed out that despite the large number of D.C. \nparolees who  commit crimes following parole release, parole appar \nently was  revoked in a  relatively small percentage of the cases. \nIn that regard,  the D.C.  Board of Parole reported that of those \nparolees in its 1977-1979 sample who  were convicted of crimes \nwhile on  parole,  parole was  revoked because of the new  offense in \nless than one half o£  the cases.  Although the ['eason for this \nstatistic was  not explained,  it appears that it may  be attributed \nto the D.C.  Parole Board policy of not issuing parole violator \nwarrants for certain offenses.  In this regard,  the Board listed \nin its 1982 Annual Report  the types of o££enses it terms \"Eligible \nO£fenses\" £or purposes o£ issuance of parole violator warrants. \nIt appears that as a matter of policy,  the Board will not issue \nparole violator warrants £or burglary of commercial establish \nments,  possession of firearms  (unless the defendant is arrested \nwith  the weapon  in his hand or on his person),  grand larceny, \nembezzlement.  rraud, forgery and  uttering and. for a host of other \nviolations of the Distri~t of Columbia Code or the United States \nCode. \nThis apparent policy which allows SUbstantial numbers  of \nparolees to continue on  parole even after arrest and conviction of \nserious crimes  was  of significant concern to us in  the past.  If \nthese matters have not yet been completely remedied,  and it may  be \ntoo early to conclude that they have,  then similar concern is \npresently warranted.  Under H.R.  2050,  the jurisdjction of the \nD.C.  Board of Parole would be substantially expanded to include \nthose D.C.  Code  offenders presently under the jurisdiction of the \nU.S.  Parole Commission.  These ofr enders ,  however,  include some of \n\n80 \nHonorable Ronald Dellums \nH.R.  2050 - Page  4 \nthe most dangerous and violent criminals convicted in the District \nof Columbia.  Premature release of such individuals pursuant to \nexisting parole policies would pose a  real and direct threat to \nlaw enforcement interests in the District of Columbia. \nWe  believe it is time for a  thorough legislative review of \nDistrict of rplumbia sentencing and  correctional practices.  A \nmajor expansion of the capacity of D.C.  correctional facilities 1s \nessential.  The  Federal Bureau of Prisons is seriously overcrowded \nand  can no longer accept the overload of the District of Columbia \nsystem.  This  is especially true in light of the increased D.C. \nprison population that would result, at least temporarily,  from a \nmore  responsibly run parole system.  Replacement of the parole \nsystem in the District of Columbia by a  sentencing guideline \nsystem similar to that adopted by Congress in the Comprehensive \nCrime Control Act of 1984 should be considered.  While expansion \nof the D.C.  inmate capacity must begin at once,  other changes  can \nbe more  thoroughly considered than is done in H.R.  2050. \nThe  Office of Nanagement  and Budget has advised this \nDej)sl'tment that there is no objection to the submission of this \nreport from  the standpoint of the Administration's program. \nSincerely, \n'.!.k3e.dd~ \n~\n/  /. ~d' \nPhi lip D.  rady \nc  ing Assistant Attorney General \nMr. .

Branton \non H.R.  3370  Before the Subcommittee on JUdiciary and Edu \ncation of the Committee on the District of Columbia, \nOctober 1,  1985.  (The  Honorable Mervyn M.  Dymally,  M.C.) \nMr.  Chairman and members of the cowmittee.  My \nname is Wiley A.  Branton,  a  resident of 1611 Tamarack \nstreet, N.W.,  Washington,  D.C.  20012.  I  am  currently a \npartner in the law firm of Sidley & Austin with offices \nat 1722 Eye Street,  N.W.,  in the District of Columbia. \nI  have been a  member of the bar for more than 33  years and \nhave resided in the District of Columbia for the past 20 \nyears.  I  currently serve as  a  member  and  Chairman of the \nDistrict of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission.  I  was \nappointed to the commission by The  Honorable Marion S. \nBarry,  Jr., as one of the Mayor's  two  appointees  to the \nseven-member Commission.  I  wish to address my  remarks  to \ncertain provisions of H.R.  3370  and the views expressed \nhere are my  personal views and no official position has been \ntaken on the matters,  except where otherwise noted,  by the \nJudicial Nomination ComTliission. \nSec.  6.  MANDATORY  RETIREMENT  AGE  OF  JUDGES \nI  fully support the raising of the mandatory \nretirement age for  judges  in the District of Columbia \ncourts from age 70  to age 74.  This change has  already \nbeen enacted into law,  but it is my  understanding that \n\n82 \nSection 6  is being offered so as to conform the D.C.  Code \nwith the District of Columbia Self-Government and \nGovernmental Reorganization Act. \nSec.  11.  PUBLIC ACCESS  TO  OF \n~mTERIALS \nJUDICIAL NOMINATION  COMMISSION \nThe very nature of judicial appointments  requires \nthe utmost confidentiality and persons who  submi't informa-\ntion to the Judicial Nomination Commission should have the \nconfidence of knowing that the information can be retained \nby the Commission as privileged and confidential informa \ntion and that it will not be subject to release under any \nprovision of the Freedom of Information Act,  or by any \nother procedure.  Lawyers,  judges and the general public \nwould be very hesitant about making  comments  that might \nreflect adversely on the character or fitness of persons \nunder consideration for  judicial appointment unless they \nare assured that their remarks or comments will be protected \nas is intended by the proposed language in Section 11. \nSec.  12.  MEETINGS  OF  THE  JUDICIAL \nNOMINATION  COMMISSION \nAs  a  general rule, meetings of the Commission \nshould be closed to the public because of the sensitive \nissues of character and fitness of potential judicial \nnominees that generally form  the subject matter of most \nmeetings.  The  same  protection that is afforded by the \npreceding section is equally as important to the meetings \nof the Commission. \n\n83 \nSec.  13.  PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT  OF  JUDICIAL \nRECO~NDATIONS \nNot only do  I  personally favor the enactment of \nSection 13,  but this subject matter has  the approval of \nthe members of the Judicial Nomination Commission who  have \nhad occasion to discuss the desirability of releasing to \nthe public the names  of individuals recommended by the \ncommission to the President of the United States for his \nconsideration in selecting nominees  for appointment to the \nDistrict of Columbia co~rts.  Invariably,  the names  leak \nout and on occasion some  erroneous  information concerning \ncertain names has been published.  Such errors could be \navoided by the official release by the Commission of the \nnames  of individuals being recommended  to the president, \nbut only after the names  have been submitted to the White \nHouse.  In my  opinion,  the public release of the names \nalerts the public to the identification of potential \njudicial nominees and will provide an opportunity for \ninformation to be made  available to the White House by \npersons who  were unaware  that certain individuals were \nbeing considered for jUdicial appointment.  There is every \nreason to believe that most of the remarks  and  information \ncoming to the White House as a  result of the public disclo-\nsure of the names of the persons being recommended  for \npossible juducial appointment would be of a  complimentary \n\n84 \nnature.  It is also quite possible that individuals will \ncorne  forward with information reflecting undesirable \ncharacter traits of such a  magnitude as  to not only alert \nthe White House that the President should not ~elect a \nparticular person who  has  been  recommended,  but which would \nhave caused the Commission  to not recommend  the person in \nthe first instance if it had been privy to the information. \nSec.  14.  DISCLOSURE  OF  CERTAIN  INFORMATION \nTO  THE  JUDICIAL NOMINATION  COMMISSION \nOnce a  person has been appointed and  confirmed as \na  judge in the District of Columbia court system,  the \nCommission on Judicial Nominations has no  further respon-\nsibility as  to the actual performance of those  judges \nduring the  terms of their respective appointments.  A \ndii:ferent agency,  the District of Columbia Commission on \nJudicial Disabilities and Tenure,  is- the agency that has the \nr(~sponsibi1ity for monitoring the conduct of  judges.  The \nlatter Commission has  the power to suspend,  retire Or \nremove  a  judge of a  District of Columbia court,  and is \nalso the agency charged with  the responsibility for \nrecommending,  for or against,  the reappointment of judges \nwhose terms  are expiring. \nThere are occasions when  information in the \npossession of the Commission on Judicial Dj,sabilities and \nTenture may be needed by the Judicial Nomination Commission, \n\n85 \nand such information could be very vital in certain \ndecisions that must be made by  the Judicial Nomination \nCommission in two  situations.  One  such situation has  to \ndo with the fact that the Judicial Nomination Commission \nhas  the responsibility for the actual appointment of the \nChief Judge  for both the Superior Court as well  as  the \nDistrict of Columbia Court of.Appeals.  It would be \nludicrous if the Judicial Nominations Commission should \nappoint any  judge to the position of Chief Judge at a \ntime when the Commission on JUdicial Disabilities and \nTenure had  information which would dictate that the person \nprobably should not be appointed Chief Judge if said \ninformation was  known  to the Judicial Nomination Commission. \nInformation would only be  sought by  the JUdicial Nomination\" \nCommission from the commission on Judicial Disabilities \nand Tenure regarding those  judges who  are actually under \nconsideration for possible appointment as  Chief Judge, \nand  the information would remain confidential with the \nJudicial Nomination Commission. \nThe  other instance where  information held by \nthe Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure could \nbe of value to the Judicial Nomination Commission would \nbe in those instances where a  judge on the Superior Court \nis being considered by  the Judicial Nomination Commission \nfor possible recommendation to the President to fill a \nvacancy on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJ~L~ \nChair•  ., \nDistrict of Columbia Judicial \nNomination Commission \n\n86 \nMr. DYMALLY.

Bar \nor  of its Board  of Governors. \n\n87 \nWe  fully support the provisions  in section 2  providing \nthat all local offenses  be conducted  in  the name  of the \nDistrict of Columbia  and  eliminating the  joinder of federal \nand  local offenses  in  indictments and  informations.  We  also \nbelieve that the  requirement  for  annual reports on \nprosecutions and  convictions by  the united states Attorney \nfor  the District of Columbia  to  the Mayor  and Council would \nbe  of great benefit to  the District Government  in  fulfilling \nits administrative and  legislative responsibilities over  the \nDistrict's criminal  justice system. \nWe  further believe  that the requirement  in section 2 \nfor  the detail of a  limited number  of Assistant Corporation \nCounsel  to  the office of the  united States Attorney would  be \nof great benefit to both  offices.  We  premise  this support \non  the understanding  that its object would  be  to give  the \nOffice of the Corporation Counsel  the benefit of greater \nexperience  in handling  prosecution of serious offenses,  to \ngive  the  United  States Attorney's Office the benefit of \nadditjonal attorneys experienced  in prosecuting  local \noffenses,  and  to promote  cooperation between  the  two \nprosecutorial offices  responsible for  public safety· in the \nDistrict.  We  would  have  serious reservations,  however,  if \nthe primary goal were  simply  to  achieve  bUdget  savings  in \nthe Office of the United  States Attorney. \nIn  addition,  we  fully  support provisions of the bill \neliminating  the  federal  role  in  the administration of  the \n- 2  -\n\n88 \nDistrict's criminal justice system.  We  therefore favor \nsection 4,  which deletes  the  requirement  that the Executive \nOfficer  of the Court be  selected from  B  list providec by  the \nAdministrative Office of the United states Courts,  and \nsection 7,  which eliminates  the Chief Judges  of  the Federal \nCircuit and  District courts  from the panel that appoints  the \nBoard  of Trustees for  the Office of the public Defender  for \nthe District of Columbia. \nSimilarly, we  support section 9,  which  eliminates the \nrequirement that District of Columbia Judges  file financial \ndisclosure reports  with  the Federal Judicial Ethics \nCommittee,  in view  of  the existing  requirement  in D.C.  Code \nS 11-1530  that these  judges  file similar  reports with  the \nDistrict of Columbia Commission  on JUdicial Disabilities and \nTenure.  We  believe  that it is consistent with court reform \nand home  rule that the District of Columbia  judiciary report \nto an  agency  of  the District of Columbia Government  rather \nthan  the Federal Government. \nLikewise,  we  support section 10,  which  would  autho~ize \nthe D.C.  Court of Appeals  to  answer  questions certified to \nit by  federal and  state appellate courts,  because  it is \nconsistent with  the  theory embodied  in the Court Reform Act \nthat the District of Columbia Court of Appeals  should be \ntreated like the highest court of a  state.  Many  states have \nsimilar referral mechanisms,  and we  believe  that giving  this \nauthority  to  the District of Columbia Court of Appeals would \nbe  in  the  interests of judicial economy. \n- 3  -\n\n89 \nWe  have  reservations about section 3,  which  would \nremove  the  sunset provision from  the  statutory authorization \nfor hearing commissioners.  while we  recognize  the need  to \next.E:l)d  this authority on  a  temporary basis  to  avoid  its \nabrupt cessation,  \\ole  believe that a  decision to make  it \npermanent at this time may  have  the negative effect of \ndiscouraging  evaluation of  the hearing commissioner  program, \nincluding  the  important questions  of  the method  of  and \nstandards  for  appointment.  Therefore,  we  suggest the \nCommittee  extend  the authority for  a  limited period  to \npermit further  evaluation. \nWe  have  grave  reservations about section 5,  which  would \nrepeal D.C.  Code  §  11-2503,  which  provides for  the \ndisbarment of attorneys convicted of crimes  involving meral \nturpitude,  Although  there may  be  some  justification for \nreconsidering  the  policy embodied  in  this law,  we  believe \nthat  its potential impact  on  the quality of the Bar  and  the \npublicls perception of the Bar  is too great for  us  to \nsupport  it without the benefit of further  debate  and \ndiscussion anlong  citizens of the District and  the members  of \nthe Bar. \nWe  have  a  varied  r~action to the provisions concerning \nthe Judicial Nomination Commission.  We  fully support \nsection 15,  which  would  give  the Commission  additional time \nto evaluat~ judges who  have  made  themselves  available for \nanother  term.  We  also support the concept of section 13, \nwhich  would  make  the  list of judicial nominees  public. \n- 4  -\n\n90 \nHowever,  we  would  suggest that the  legislation make  it clear \nwhether  the Cow~ission or  the President has \"the \nresponsibility of making  the  list public and  specify \nguidelines  as  to  the  timing of  the disclosure of the  list. \nWhile we  have  no  opposition  to  the policies embodied  in \nthose provisions  of  sections 11  and  12  that exempt  the \nCommission  from  the D.C.  Freedom of Information Act and Open \nMeetings provision,  respectively, we  believe that the \nCouncil of the District of Columbia has  the legislative \npower  to makes  these  exemptions  and  should \"be  given the \nopportunity to do  so.  Our  analysis leads us  to conclude  the \nthe Commission,  as  an  agency  of  the District Gover.nment,  is \nspecifically excluded  from  the  federal Freedom of \nInformation Act  by  5  U.S.C.  §55l(1) (D)  but that it does \nI \nfall within  the scope of the D.C.  Freedom of  Information \nAct.  Therefore,  the Council,  not Congress,  should  enact any \nlegislation making  exemptions  from  this local act. \nLikewise,  we  believe  that the Council should  be \npermitted  to  exempt  the Commission  from  the Open  Meetings \nprovision,  D.C.  Code  §  1-1504.  This provision,  although \noriginally enacted by Congress  by  Title VII  of the  . \nSelf-GOVernment Act,  is a  purely local law which  the \ndra£ters of that Act contemplated would  be within  the \nlegislative authority of  the Council.  No  one  has questioned \nthe council's authority to amend  other provisions of local \nlaw enacted by  Title VII,  such  as  the  amendments  to  the D.C. \n- 5  -\n\n91 \nElection Act,  added  by  §  751  of the Self-Government Act. \nTherefore,  the Council  should be permitted to amend  the \nlocal Open  Meetings  provision to provide  an  exemption  for \nthe Commission. \nWe  have reservations about two  provisions  in section 14 \n~f the bill, which  permit disclosure of  certain confidential \ninformation submitted  to  the Commission--namely,  the \nprovision authorizing  a  judge  to disclose confidential \nmedical  information,  which  may  have  the  practical effect of \nforcing  its disclosure(  and  the provision permitting \ndisclosure of documents  at a  h~aring before  the Commission \nfor  the purposes  of prosecution for  perjury before  the \nCommission,  which may  raise  fifth amendment concernS.  We \nbelieve  that these prOVisions  should be more  fully discussed \nbefore enactment. \nFinally,  we  oppose section 16  of  the bill,  which  would \neliminate  the option of  the Tenure Commission  to rate a \njudge  \"exceptionally well-qualified.\"  The  requirement can \n> \nand  should be made  to  serve  the purpose of recognizing  those \njudges whose  service  is truly exceptional.  It also serves \nas  an  inducement  to  judges  to maintain a  high quality of \njustice.  In our  view,  any  efforts expended concerning  this \nrequirement should be  devoted  to making  the rating \nmeaningful by,  for  example,  encouraging  the Commission  to \ngive  reasons  for  an  \"exceptionally well-qualified\"  rating. \nTherefore,  we  believe that this section should  be  deleted \nfrom  the bill. \n- 6  -\n56-728 0 - 86  - 4 \n\n92 \nIn conclusion,  we  support  the many  provisions of H.R. \n3370  that further  the  independence of  the District's \njUdicial and  criminal  justice system and  thereby enhance \nhome  rule.  We  have  reservations about certain provi~lons \nthat are unrelated to  this purpose,  and  hope  that the \nCommittee will reconsider  the ones  that we  have mentioned. \nwith  these exceptions,  we  support this legislation and hope \nthat the Committee will take favorable  action. \nThank you  for  the opportunity to submit  this statement. \nMr. DYMALLY. Legal memo to staff from the American Law Divi~ \nsion ofCRS. \n[The memorandum follows:] \n\" \n\n93 \nCongressional Research Service \nThe Library of Congress \nW.shlngton. D.C.  20540 \nJuly 18, 1985 \nTO:  House D!strict of Columbia Committee \nAttention:  Donald Temple \nFROM:  American Law Division \nSUBJECT:  Effect of Abolition of Federal Parole Commission by 1984 \nComprehensive Crime Control Act upon D.C.  Code Offenders \nThis is in response to your request for an examination of \nthe effect of the abolition of the Federal Parole Board by P.L. \n98-473, the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, upon D.C. \nCode offenders housed in federal and District of Columbia institutions. \nOur examination is, of necessity, limited by your time constraints. \nFurther, the implementation of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act \nof 1984 is far from complete, and elucidation of its standards in \npractice may ahed light upon the questions you have raised.  Nevertheless, \nto the extent that our~current information and time constraints permit us, \nwe shall end~avor to respond to your questiQns as fully as possible. \nParole authority over D.C. Code offenders confined in District \nof Columbia penal institutions appears to be vested in the District's \novo Board of Parole under D.C. Code §  24-201a ~ The Comprehensive \nCrime Control Act of 19!14 does not .ppear to address this authority, \nand therefore the authority of the District Board of P£role would seem \nto be undisturbed by the new legislation. \nThe Act's effect upon federally housed D.C. offenders \nappears to present a more difficult question.  D.C.  Code § 24-209 \nvests authority o;er prisoners convicted in the Dintrict of Columbia \n\n94 \n'of offenses against the United States or now or heresfter confined in any \nfederal penitentiary or prison in the Federal Parole Board created by \n18 U.s.C. § 723..  Under Section 24-209 of the D.C.  Code,  the Federal \nParole Board's authority over such federally housed prisoners is \nparallel to that of the District Board of Parole over prisoners \nconfined,in the District's own  institutions.  In 1976, the Federal \nParole Board was .eplaced by the U.S. Parole Commission.  Act of \"arch IS, \n1976, P.L. 94-233, 90 Stat. 219.  Section 12 of P.L. 94-23j provided that: \nWhenever in any of the laws of the United Statea or the District \nof Columbia the term 'United States Parole Board', or any other \nterm referring thereto, is used, such term or terms, on or sfter \nthe effective date of this Act, shall be deemed  to refer to \nthe United States Parole Coromis.ion as e.tab1ished by the \namenrlments made by this Act. \nThu., the U.S. Parole Commi •• ion appears to 'have as.umed the juriadiction \nover the D.C. offenders committed to federal custody previously held by \nthe Parole Board under Section 24-209 of the D.C. Code.  Under \nthe 1984 Gomprehen.ive Crime Control Act, See. 218(a)(5), Chapter 311 \nof title 18 of the U.S. Code (which include. the cu~rent federal parole \npro~ision. qnd  those which deal with the U.S. Parole Commis.ion) is \nrepealed.  The effectl~e date of this repealer is addressed in \nSee. 235(b)(1)(A) of P.L. 98-473, which .tates that Chapter 311  (among other.) \n.hall remain in effect for five yearo after the effective date \n[of this Act}  as to an individual convicted of an offense or \nadjudicated to be a juvenile delinquent before the effective \ndate and 88 to 8  term of imprisonment during the period \ndescribed in sub.ection (8)(1)(B) \nThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 also extends the term of office \nof s U.S. Parole Commissioner in office on  the effecti~e date of the Act \nfor the five year period.  Further, the Act requires that: \n(3)  The United States Parole Commission shall set a release \ndate for an  individual who will be in ~ts jurisdiction the day \n\n95 \nbefore the expiration of five years after the effective date of \nthis Act, that is within the ran~e that applies to the prisoner \nunder the applic&hle parole guideline.  A release dace set \npursuant to this pa.sgraph shall be set early enou~h to permit \nconsideration of an appeal of the release date, in accordance \nwith Parole Commission procedures, before the expiration of \nfive years following the effective date of this Act. \nThe Act does not appear to address dlreccly the question of \nthe effect of P.L. 98-473 upon  the power given to the federal parole \nauthority under D.C. law with respect to D.C. offenders committed to \nfederal custody.  However, by virtue of the fact that, at the expiration \nof the five-year period following the Act's effective date, the U.S. \nParole Commission would cease to exist (unless the Congress, upon review \nof required studJes, should determine that the parole system ahould be \nreinstated and  the life of the Parole Commission extended under Sec. \n236(b)(3) of the Act), a question would seem to arise with respect to \nwhat suthority would then wield the power over such offenders theretofore \nwielded by the U.S. Parole Commission.  The Act itself Is 8Uent on \nthis question. \nWe  hope that this will be of assistance. \n42--I7'.//1-.) \n,-.: ~.I';: \nEHiabe'tli B. ;:Bl(zan \n~gislatlve Attorney \n,/ \n\n96 \nMr.  DYMALLY.

W. \nWashington,  P.C.  20534 \nDelays in Designation \nThe Bureau of Prisons cannot designate an offender un til it receives \nboth the appropriate materials  from  the Court and  a  request for \ndesignation fran the U.S.  Marshal,  District of Columbia. \nIf the Bureau of Prisons receives the refer!:al pacXet fran  the Court \nbut does not receive the U.S.  Marshal's request for designation,  the \napp:cpriate OOP  official. will telephone the Legal  P.ssistance Office \nof the Superior Court to detemine if, in fact,  the Cou.t desires an \nimmediate federal designation and if so,  if a  copy of  the Judgment \nand Commitment has been sent to the U.S.  \"Ia rs hal ,  D.C'.  If the sen \ntencing Judge still desires a  federal designation but the Judgment \nand  Commitment has not been sent to the U.S.  Marshal,  the Legal \nAssistance Office will follow through on  the Court's wishes.  If, \nhowever,  the Legal Assistance Office indicates that the U.S,  Marshal \nhas been notified of the Court's wishes,  the Bureau  of  Prisons will \ncall the U.S.  Marshal'13  Office (Deputy  U.S.  Marshal  - 633-1778)  to \nexpedi te the designation process. The Bureau of P.isons will not des \nignate an offender until the U.S.  Marshal,  D.C. requests designation. \nIf the Bureau of Prisons receives the U.S.  \"Iarshal's reqoost for des \nignation but does not receive the referral packet fran  the Court,  the \napJ;ropriate OOP  official will contact the Legal. Assistance Office of \nthe SUperior Court.  The  BOP  will telephone tne r.egal  Assistancid \nOffice (727-5038)  on a  weekly basis 'Co reqoost the necessary  mater \nial.  PIlone calls will be followed  up with a  letter detailing  the \nname and dOcXet number of the offeooer,  the naJTte  of  the sentencing \nJudge,  and the date of the U.S.  Marshal's reqoost. \nProbation Violators \nIn the case of D.C. Superior Court probation violators,  the respon \nsibili ty ranains wi th the canmi ttill;! Judge to sem a  referral letter \nand two copies of the PSI to the Bureau of Prisons.  If the case is a \nresult of a  technical violation, the Department of  Social. services \nprepares a  probation violation re:port.  If the violation is a  result \nof crimi nal conduct resul ting in a  new conviction,  the Judge  may  re \nquire an upiated PSI detailill;! the ciroomstances of the new  offence. \nIn either case,  the new information should be forwarded  to the BOP  in \naddition to the PSI's and the Judge's referral letter.  at ,.,articular \ninteres t  to the BOP is the of fici al ve rs ion of the of fe ns e  a nd  any \nchanges i;. the social history of the offender,  including chanqes  in \nmental health status or 3mq and/or alccho 1 aOOs(,.  As  in the case of \n\n101 \ndi):\"ect canmitments,  the FOP  will not designate from  a  PSI  that was \nprepared more than one year before the date of sentencinq  in the \ninstant offense.  If an upiated PSI is not prepared, a  copy of the PO \n163  (the arrestiTJj officer's rep:>rt), an official version as if for a \npSI and/or the Affidavit in Supp>rt of the Arrest Warrant should be \nincluded in the packet sent to the FOP. \nProbation Violators \nIndividuals convict.ed in D.C. Superior Court,  designated to a  federal \ninstitution and released on parole by the U.S.  Parole Commission,  who \nviola te the teIInS of their parole, will be designa ted  by  the Des ig \nnations Officer, Northeast Regional Office, Bureau of Prisons. \nViolations as a  result of a  new criminal conviction:  If the U.S. \nProbation Officer desires to revoke  the parole of a  Superior Court \nparolee, he or she will contact the U.S.  Parole commission to issue a \nwarrart.  ~e U.S.  Parole Commission will contact the U.S.  \"Iarshal to \nexecute the warrant. \nOnce the warrant is executed by the U.S.  11arshal,  the USM  will re \nquest designation by 'IWX  fran  the U.S.  Parole commission (NERO).  ~e \nU.S.  Parole commission will, in turn,  request designation from  the \nNortheast Designations Officer, Bureau of Prioons. \nTechnical Violators:  The U.S.  Probation Officer will conduct a  pre \nliminax:y interview to detennine if the revocation hearing  should be \nconduct'i'd locally or in a  federal institution.  If the hearing is \nconducted locally, and the individual's parole is revok.ed,  the Parole \nCommission will contact the Northeast Designations Officer,  Bureau of \nPrisons,  to request designation.  If the hearing is to be  conducted \nin a  federal institution,  the NERO  Designations  Officer,  BOP  will \ndesignate a  federal institution. \nQuestions concernin:;  the designation of parolees  from  D.C.  Superior \ncourt, should be directed to, \nDesignations Officer, NERO/OOP \nPhiladelphia,  Pennsyl w.nia \n(212) 5915-5652 \n(FTS)  596-5652 \nD.  Female Prisoners \nWomen who  receive sentences in the Superior Court that are \ngreater than one year and ..mo are not wi thin nine months of a  s tatu \ntory parole eligibility, expiration or mandatory  release date,  are \nalmost IIlways au.tomatically desiqnated to a  federal institution,  be \ncause the D,c.i~partment of Corrections does not h/We  a  f acili ty \nthat is designed' for l.orq-teD'll incarceration of women.  '[bis does not \n\n102 \nmean that women will be treatei for all purposes as federal desig \nnatees.  A. process ha'·' nCM  been established hy which female prisoners \nare reviE!llled by the District of. Columbia Department of Corrections \nfor halfway house placement.  (See  the Joint Agreement reproducp.d \nhelCM.l  Because of possible confusion or error,  it may  be wise for \ncrunsel to provide female clients who are placed  in federal  facili \nties with a  ccpy of this agreement.  Counsel with questions  about \nfemale client!'; in the federal system can contact the Federal Bureau \nof Prisons,  Correctional Programs Division,  320 First Street,  N.w., \nWashing'ton,  P.C.  (724-3257).  With this current arrang'ement,  there is \nno reason for drunsel to request a  federal designation for a  femalp. \nclient;  the woman will receive a  federal designation anyway  and \nccunsel's request may  cause her to lose the chance of an earlier \nparole by the D.C. Board ot: Parole,  directly from  the jail.  More \nover, once a  client arrives at the federal institution, i·e is usually \nanv;i.sable for her to ask to see the D.C.  Parole  Board.  Even  though \nshe may  need  to wait a  little 10ng'er before seeing' the !J.C. Iloard, if \nthe client is seen first by the federal parole hoard she is likely to \nbe set off for a  substantial period of time. \nJOINT AGREEMENT  BETWEEN THE BUREAU OF  PRISON~ \nAND  THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  DEPARTMENT OF \nCORRECTIONS  REGARDING FEMALE OFFENDERS \nThe Bureau of Prisons  and  the District of  Columbia  Department of \nCorrections agree to the procedures outlined below  to formalize  the \nprovisions for desiqnatin;r  rureau of Prisons' facilities for District \nof Columhia women and for transferrirq District of Columbia women  to \nand fran  facili ties of the Bureau of Prisons. \nUnder Section 24-201 of the D.C. Code,  the District of Columbia Board \nof Parole has jurisUction over prisoners confined in arf{ District of \nColumbia facility, and may  imp:>se a  release date or modify one al \nready established by the United States Parole Commission.  To  mi tiga te \nthe effects of the distance at which  D.C. women are housed fran  their \nhanes,  and to qive then an oPJ=Ortunity to have  their cases heard by. \nthe District of Columbia Boa.rd of Parole,  this Agreement formalizes \nthe procedures for designating  federal  facilities £or D.C.  women. \nThis Agreenent also establishes a  review  process for determining  a \nD.C. woman's apJXq:>riateness for placement in a  D.C halfway  house or \n£or release on parole. That reviE!lll  process will be knCMn  as a  \"trans \nfer status review\" and will be conducted  by  the !J.C.  Department of \nCorrections and D.C. Board of Parole  up:>n  reqUest from  the federal \ninstitution housing'  the woman. \nJ:lecause the District of Columbia has no facili ties to house loog-tenn \nD.C. women,  the Bureau of Prisons has agreed to: \n1.  Designate federal institutions for most D.C. Code violators \nservirq sentences of more than one year but who  are not \nwithin nine months of a  statutory parole eligibility, \nexpiration,  or mandatory release date. \n\n103 \n2.  Rafer to the D.C. Department of Corrections  and  the D.C. \nBoard of Parole for transfer consideration any  D.C.  woman \nin its custody who makes su::h a  reqoost and is within nine \nmonths 0;: statutory parole p.ligibility, an expiration date, \nor a  manda'~ory release date. \nA parole eligibility date is the date on which  a  D.C.  woman  becomes \neligible for parole considerat'on.  An expiration date is the date on \nwhich a  D.C. woman is to be released with 180 days or less  of  accum \nulated good time.  A mandatory release date is the aate\"\"on which  a \no.C. woman is to be released wi th more than 180 days  of acCUmulated \ngood time.  Because a  decision to seek a  hearirq with the u.s.  Parole \nCommission is entirely voluntary,  the absence of any  U.S.  Parole \nCommission action or the presence of  a  presumptive  parole date es \ntablished by the U.S.  Parole Commission will not influence  the time \nat which a  referral is made,  nor will any  U.S.  Parole Commission \naction be required for favorable transfer consineration bv the D.

'the \nD.C.  Department of Corrections and the D.C. Board of Parole will make \nthose detexminations within 60 days.  If the offender is unsuitable \nfor canmunity placement at that time or is unlikely to be paroled  in \nthe near future,  the Chief Classification and  Parole  Officer,  D.C. \nDetention Facility, will make  a  written request to the Administrator, \nCorrectional Prograflls Branch,  that the deSignation proceed.  Upon \nreceipt of this written request,  the Bureau of Prisons will dt;lsignate \nan appcq>riate federal facility. \n\n104 \nIf the offender is found  to be a  suitable candidat.e for community \nplacanent or parole, the Chief Classification and Parole Officer, \nD.C.

'\" D.C. woman may  choose not to be  referred.  If a  woman \ndeclines referral, a  cc:py of  the form  reflecting this declination \nwill be fONarded  to the D.C.  Department of Corrections  and D.C. \nBoard of Parole.  Any woman who declin<:s referral at the time  of her \ninitial orientation will be given a  second op)X>rtunity when she is \nwithin nine months of parole eliqibility or. whenever she so requasts. \nIf she again declines,  notice of this action will again be  forwarded \nto the D.C.  Department of Corrections and D.C. Board of Parole.  Each \nwoman who  requests  referral will be referred  for  transf.er sti\\tus \nreview when she is within nine months of a  pa.ICole  eligibility, e,~­\npiration or mandatory release date. \nFor each  referral of a  D.C.  woman,  Bureau of  Prisons staff will \nprovide the following information: \n(a)  A cover  letter from  Warden  (the cover letter will not \ninclude a  recommendation) I \n(b)  Sentence Date (BP-5); \n(c)  Pre-Sentence Re)X>rt,  when available; \n(d)  Progress Report completed not mor\"  than 90 days  prior to \nthe referral; \n(el  A psychiatric or psychological  report completed  not more \nthan 90 days  prior to the  referral for any  D.C.  woman \ncOlImitted  for a  violent offense or with a  prior record \nincludirg a  violent offense. \nTO  expedite the referral process,  all referral packages will pe \nmailed directly to: \n\n105 \nAssistant Director \nWomen's Erograms and Community Ser\\l'ices \nDistrict of Columbia Department of Corrections \n614 H Street,  N.W.,  #1001 \nwashington,  D.C.  20001 \nand: \nI)istrict of Columbia Board of J>arole \n614 H Street, N.W.,  1I563 \nWashinqton,  D.C.  20001 \nIf the Department of Corrections or the Board of Parole require more \ninformation to.make a  decision,  the institution will provide  it upon \nrequest.  'l'o expp.dite such a  request and the reterralprocess, either \nof the D.C. aqencies may contact the Correctional Prograns  Branch  at \n724-3081, which will relay the request to the appropriate institu \ntion. \nReferral of D.C.

If a \nD.C.  woman becanes eligible  for  r~ferral while in the District of \nColumbia on =i t,  the Department of Corrections Case Management fl taff \nwill, upon the woman's request,  refer her for transfer.  The D.C. \nstaff will sem for aplXcpriate referral material  from  the institu \ntion and  prepare an additional progress report covering any  new \ninforn1ation.

If the D.C.  Department of Corrections and D.C. \nBoard of Parole detennine a  D.C. woman is inappropriate for halfway \nhouse placanent or parole, each will sem a  letter to the Warden of \nthe federal institution, indicating the reasons for the denial. \nThe decision of a  D.C. woman,  in federal custody,  to have  a  hearing \nbefore the Unitel States Parole  Commission is entirely voluntary; \ntherefore,  the absence of a  Unitel States Parole Commission decision \ncannot be the basis for denyinq a  D.C. woman's request for transfer \nto the D.C. Department of Corrections. \nTransfer Approval.  If the Assistant Director, Women's Programs,  D.C. \nOe?artment of Corrections and/or the D.C.

The Effect of a  Parole Violator's \nWarrant on  the Sentence \nMany  defendants who await sentencing are also facirq a  possible \nrevocation of parole.  '!'he status of any  parole violator's warrant \n(whether it ha<J been issued and  riot executed or issued and  executed) \nis very important in order for the defendant to avoid serving colise \ncutive sentences.  The execution of the wa rrant is the controlE ng \nfactor here,  not whe-c:her the client's parole has been revoked formal \nly at a  revocation hearing. \nIf a  parole violator's warrant has been issued  and  lodged \nagainst the client as a  detainer -- but not executed  -- at the time \nhe is sentenced on a  new offense,  the sentencing court is powerless \nto make  the n_ sentence conseOltive  to the old sentence.  This is \nbecause the defendant is incarcerated  solely on  the new  conviction \nand is not in custody on an exeo.lted parole violator!! warrant.  Pre \nconviction credi t,  under 18  U.S.C.  ~3568, reduces only  the new \nsentence. \nIt is,  therefore,  u,wally 1.n the interest of  the client not tc \nhave  the warrant executed, and ccunsel's slbmission to the D.C. Board \nof Parole or the U.S.  Parole Commiflsion of information and  arguments \naga ins t  exe= tion,  if done early ina nM€   case,  is of ten effective to \navoid  execution of the warrant. ~ Moreover,  coonsel flhould seEk to \n2!!1  Counsel's ability at a  \"five-day hold heario;!\" to represent that \nthe Board will not execute its warrant or initiate revocation \nprocee:iill':l's mllY be extremelY important in the bail determina \ntion.  ~ ~ Chapter 1 • \n\n107 \nMr. DYMAL1..Y.

These proposals generally implement legislative rec \nommendations  of  the  Borsky Committee Study that  require Con \ngressional action.  They have  been  developed  with  the help of \nan  informal legislative group.  While  none  of them  are major, \ntogether  they will help strengthen and  improve  the  functioning \nof  the District of Columbia  court system. \nA brief description follows  of  the Borsky Committee \nStudy,  of  the  informal  legislative group,  and  of  the proposals \nthemselves. \nBorsky committee  Study \nIn 1978  the District of Columbia .Bar  established  the \nDistrict of Columbia Court System study Committee  under  the \nchairmanship of Charles A.  Borsky.  That Committee was  charged \n\n110 \nwith assessing  the effect of the District of Columbia Court \nReform  and  Criminal Procedure Act of 1970  (84  stat. 473),  and \nwith making  \"such  recommendations  as are warranted  for  further \nimprovement  in the  court system of the District.\" \nThe  Committee  conducted  a massive study and  issued \nnine reports which  are commonly  referred  to  collectively as  the \nBorsky Committee Study.  One  report,  on  court organization, \ndealt with problems common  to  both  the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals  and  the  Superior Court.  One  report dealt with \nthe Court of Appeals.  The  other seven  reports addressed  the \nvarious branches of  the  Superior Court. \nThe  entire Study,  consisting of the  nine  reports,  was \nprinted as  a  committee  print in April 1983  by the Subcommittee \non Governmental  Efficiency and  the District of Columbia  of  the \nsenate Committee  on Governmental Affairs,  S.  Prt.  98-34. \nThe  Horsky Committee Study makes  numerous  recommenda \ntions.  They have  been  reviewed  by  the D.C.  courts an~ by a \ncommittee of the D.C.  Bar  appointed  for  implementing  those  rec \nommendations.  Many  of those  recommendations can  be,  and  have \nbeen,  implemented  by the courts  themselves.  Others  require \nlegislative action either  by  the Congress  or by the  council of \nthe District of Columbia. \n\n111 \nThe  Informal  Legislative Group \nAn  informal legislative gcoup was  created at the \ninvitation of the Council for  Court Excellence and  the  Bar's \nCommittee  for  the  Implementation of  the Horsky  committee Study. \nThe purpose was  to formulate  a  set of legislative proposals \nimplementing  recommendations of the Borsky Committee Study on \nwhich  there seems  to be general agreement and  to get support \nfor  enactment. \nThe  informal group has  consisted of majority and \nminority staff representatives from  the  cognizant House  and \nSenate committees,  representatives of  the  Council  of  the Dis \ntrict of Columbia and  its Judiciary Committee,  representatives \nof the Mayor's office and  the  Corporation Counsel,  the United \nStates Attorney,  the Chief Judges  of the D.C.  courts and  the \nExecutive Officer  of  the  D.C.  courts,  the  Executive Director of \nthe D.C.  Bar  and  representatives of Divisions  2,  4  and  6  of  the \nBar  and  of the  Bar's Implementation Commitcee,  and  representa \ntives of  the  Council for  Court Excellence. \nThe  group has  had  six meetings and  has  considered \nvarious of the Borsky Committee  Study legislative recommenda \ntions.  No  votes have  been  taken and  none  of  the  individuals or \nentities represented on  the group are bound  in  any way.  How \never,  the  attached proposals are what has  emerged  as more  or \n\n112 \nless of a  consensus deserving of SUpport.  While  they were \nbeing  developed,  recommendations dealing with  retired  judges \nand  the jurisdictional limit for  small claims were partially \nimplemented  by enactment of Public Law 98-598. \nThe  Lzgislative proposals \nThe legislative proposals follow,  numbered  as  Items \nNo.  1  through 12.  The  first ten  items are  from  the Horsky Com \nmittee Study.  In  each of  those  ten items  there  is  reference  to \nthe particular Horsky  Committee Study recommendation  inVOlved, \ns'.lggested  legislative lanquage,  and  an  explanation of the pur \npose  of the  proposal. \nThe  last two  items -- Nos.  11  and 12 -- did not \nresult from  the Hotsky COlllmittee Study.  They arose during  the \ngroup's consideration and  were  believed  to  warrant  inclusion  in \nthe package.  Like  the other  items,  these  two  proposals ~ontain \nsuggested  legislative language and  an  explanation of the pur \npose  of  the proposal. \nAS  will be  apparent,  none of the proposals is major. \nSimilarly,  none of them is believed  to  be controversial;  in the \ncourse of the  work  of the group,  several  recommendations  were \neliminated as either controversial or  unnecessary.  Taken \ntogether  the ~ttached proposals should  help improve  and \n\n113 \nstrengthen  the  functioning  of the  court system of the District \nof Co~umbia.  It is hoped  that they can be  combined  and  made \nthe  nucleus of a  bill which  could  be  the District of Columbia \nJUdicial Improvements  Act of 1985. \nIf further  information is desired  about  these \nproposals contact either Sam  Harahan of  the  Council  for  Court \nExcellence  (783-7736)  or John H.  Pickering, Chairman of the \nBar's Implementation Committee  (872-6200). \ny,  Chairman \nExcellence \n\n114 \nITEM  NO.1 \nRecommendation No.  5 of the court Organization Report2/ \n- Eliminating the requirement that the Executive \nOfficer of the D.C.  Courts be appointed from a \nlist of persons submitted by the Director of the \nAdministrative Office of the united States Courts. \nAmendment \nsection 1703(b)  of title 11 of the District of \nColumbia Code is amended to read as  follows: \n(b)  The Exec~tive Officer shall be selected \nby,  and subject tel  removal by,  the Joint committee \non Judicial Administration with the concurrence of \nthe respective chief judges.  The Joint Committee \nshall consider experience and  special training in \nadministrative and executive positions,  and \nfamilinrity with court procedures.  The  judges \nmay  consult with the Director of the Administra \ntive Office and with the Commission on Qualifica-\ntions :.)f Federal Cil:cuit Executives,  for the \npurpose of obtaining the names of qualified \ncandidates;  however,  the judges shall not be \nlimited to choosing among the candidates sug \ngested by the Director or the Commission. \n!/ \nThis and similar references are to recommendations \n~n the indicated reports of the District of Columbia Bar's \nD.C.  Court System Study Committee published as a  Senate committee \nPrint, S.  Prt. 98-34,  and commonly referred to as the Horsky \nCommittee StUdy_ \n\n115 \nPurpose \nThis amendment implements Recommendation No.  5 of \nthe Court Organization Report;  it is supported by the D.C. \nSuperior Court Board of Judges. \nThis amendment alters the present method of \nselecting an Executive Officer for the D.C.  Courts.  The \nExecutive Officer is responsible Eor  the administration of \nthe District of Columbia Court System,  subject to the \n/5uper.rision of the Joint Committee and the Chief Judges. \nCurrently,  the Executive Officer must be chosen from among \na  list of candidates put forward by the Director of the \nAdministrative Of£ice of the united States Courts.  This \namendment vests the choice in the hands of the Joint Com \nmittee on Judicial Administration, with the concurrence of \nboth Chief Judges.  The Judges'  choice is no longer \nrestricted to candidates suggested by the Director, \nalthough they are free to consult with him and with the \nCommission on the Qualifications of Federal Circuit \nExecutives.  The criteria listed in the statute are \nadvisory;  they are ~he same  as the criteria set forward \nin the statute dealing with the qualifications of federal \ncircuit executives.  29  U.S.C.  332(£). \nThe change is intended to alleviate problems \nwhich have become apparent in the present system by \ngiving the local jUdiciary more discretion in their \nchoice and a  greater responsibility for that choice. \n\n116 \nThe D.C.  Superior Court Board of Judges considers this \nscheme for selection more appropriate than the current \nsystem.  The selection of a  Court Executive is essentially \na  local matter.  Now  that the position of court adminis \ntrator has become more prevalent across the country,  it \nis no longer necessary to depend on the federal system \nfor the selection of an executive for the P.C.

A 30-day period is especially troublesome when \n., \nmore than one vacancy occurs and all the nominations must \nbe reported within 30  days.  This difficulty was expressly \nrecognized in the recent enactment creating seven new \nSuperior Court judgeships, which included a  provision \nallowing ninety days for the Judicial Nomination commission \nto act.

Representative \nDymally described the problem as follows: \nBecause in 1981 there were three \ninvestigators and now with an  increased \nworkload,  they only have two  investigators. \nThe last time they were faced with this \nproblem they had a  tremendous problem which \ncalled for a  supplemental appropriation to \nexpedite the process.  It was  felt that the \n90  days will give them enough  time to do a \nthorough investigation and submit to the \nPresident the best nominees there are. \nThat is basically it.  It is not to delay \nthe process,  but simply to give them enough \ntime, with limited staff to submit to the \nPresident the best candidates that there \nare in the district. \n130 Congo  Rea.

(At this time,  the Commission \n\n121 \nshall anno~nce publicly the names of those \npersons recommended by the Commission so \nthat the public may have an opportunity to \nsubmit comments on the reco~nendations to \nthe President.) \nPurpose \nThe amendments to the District 'of Columbia Self \nGovernment and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973  re \nsulting from Recommendations Nos.  21,  22  and 23  of the \nCourt Organization Report all address the selection process \nof the D.C.  Judicial Nomination Commission.  Currently,  the \njUdicial selection process in the District of Columbia \nlacks protections that would render the process more \neffective.  In structuring the procedure for choosing \nD.C.  judges, however,  the values of full public access, \nand government in the \"sunshine\" must be balanced against \nthe need for the Nomination Commission to receive essen \ntial information regarding pro~pective nominees in the \nstrictest confidence.  This balance will ensure fair and \neffective decisionmaking while providing public comment \nand scrutiny at the appropriate stages of the process. \nThe Board of Judges of the Superior Court supports the \nfirst two  recommendations and has no opinion on the \nthird. \n1.  With respect to the first amendment,  it \n\n122 \nis important to appreciate that the Nomination commission \nperforms,  in part, a  merit review function.  The Commission \nscreens and identifies nominees for judicial office on the \nbasis of merit prior to selecting for nomination among  the \nqualified candidates.  To ensure open and candid discus \nsion of judicial candidates,  it is necessary to restrict \naccess to materials furnished to or developed by the Com \nmission during the selection process.  District government \nlaws and regulations presently are unclear as to the \napplicability of the local and federal Freedom of Infor \nmation Acts to the procedures of the Commission.  This \namendment clarifies existing law by providing a  statutory \nexemption to the Federal and D.C.  Freedom of Information \nActs.  With this amendment,  information about potential \njudicial nominees will be submitted with greater confi \ndence as to its confidentiality. \nThe drafters were not unsympathetic to the concern \nthat the interested public have ample opportunity for input \nat the Nomination Conwission level.  However,  we  were con \ncerned that many candidates well qualified for judicial \noffice would refuse to be considered for nomination absent \nconfidentiality.  Further,  there is also concern that some \nsources may be reluctant to speak candidly about judicial \ncandidates to the Nomination Commission absent confiden \ntiality. \nThe Judicial Nomination Commission has an \n\n123 \naffirmative responsibility, which should be underlined,  to \nseek information about prospective candidates from all quar \nters of the community.  Lengthening the period for completing \nthe nomination process will enable the Nomination Commission \nto do so and to consider more fully community views \nabout prospective candidates.  Members of the community \nwith comments concerning prospective judicial nominees \nshould feel less constrained in presenting their views \nunder the proposed amendment.  In short,  this first \namendment would enhance the quality of the process in \nthe initial stages by removing  the chilling effect of \nopen access to information obtained and generated by \nthe Commission. \n2.  Similarly,  the second amendment  (Recommenda \ntion No.  22,  to clarify the exemption of the JUdicial \nNomination Commission from public meeting requirements) \nreflects the policy that secrecy of proceedings and \ndeliberation at the Judicial Nomination Commission stage \nensures more candid and open debate over the potential \ncandidates.  Those with views about the suitability of \njudicial candidates,  as well as the candidates themselves, \nare better served by proceedings conducted outside the \npublic eye.  Again,  with this amendment,  exchange within \nthe Commission will escape the inhibiting effects of \nclose public scrutiny and should result in more produc \ntive dialogue. \n56-728 0 - 86 - 5 \n\n124 \nThe ad hoc legislative group recognized that th~ \neffect of Item No.  3 reqardinq the District of Columbia \nFreedom of Information Act could be accomplished by the \nCouncil of the District of Columbia amending that act. \nMoreover,  it is arguable  (although not clear)  that the \ncouncil also could accomplish Item No.4.  These amend \nments are nevertheless being recommended to the Congress \nsince it alone can amend section 434  of the Self-Government \nAct and there is no doubt regarding Congress's ability to \nreform section 742  of that Act.  Accordingly Items Nos.  3 \nand  4 have been fashioned to complement any initiative the \nCouncil may take to amend the District of Columbia Freedom \nof Information Act or section 742 of the Self-Government \nAct.  The scope of the current group of legislative \nproposals is aimed at the Congress.  When  the ad hoc \nlegislative group undertakes future recommendations  for \nthe Council's consideration, of course,  any elements of \nItems Nos.  3 and 4 which remain pending and within the \njurisdiction of the Council can be proposed fresh at that \ntime. \n3.  The final amendment  (public announcement of \nnominees)  addresses the need to ensure a  mechanism for \npublic knowledge of the results of the judicial nominating \nprocess.  The revision requires the Commission to announce \npublicly the names  of those persons recommended by the \nCommission at the time it submits the names  to the \n\n125 \nPresident.  This change will ensurE~ that those persons \nwith views about judicial nominees have the opportunity \nto present their views to the President in a  timely \nmanner.  Presently,  the public is dependent upon \nlearning the names of judicial nominees from the media \nor other secondary sources.  Since the President selects \nthe judges from the list of nominees,  this amendment \nseeks to encourage public input into the procedure. \nFor additional explanation of these three \nproposals see pp.  853-55 of the Horsky Con~ittee study, \nS.

The amendment alters \nSection 1528  to provide that the D.C.  JUdicial Disability \nand Tenure Commission may,  in its discretion,  provIde the \nD.C.  Judicial Nomination commission with information which \nit may  possess relating to any  judge under consideration \nby the Nomination Commission for elevation to the Court \nof Appeals or to the office of chief judge.  The amendment \nis not intended to alter the basic principle of the section \nthat records of proceedings before the Disability Commission \nare privileged and confidential.  However,  when one investi-\ngatory commission of the D.C.  judicial systen, possesses \ninformation relevan\" to an o.ngoing consideration by \nanother investigatory conwission,  it is appropriate that \nrecords material to the fitness of the candidate be \nshared.!:../ \n*/  For additional e~planation see p.  857  of the \nBorsky Committee Study,  S.

If a declaration \nis so filed,  the Tenure Commission shall, \nnot less than  [sixty calendar days)  prior \n\n129 \nto the expiration of the declaring candidate's \nterm of office,  • \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this amendment is to allow a  longer \nperiod of consideration for  judicial reappointments by both \nthe Tenure commission and the President.  The amendment \nimplements Recommendation No.  28 of the Court Organization \nReport of the Horsky Committee study.  That D.C.  Bar Study \nfound that n[b]y all accounts,  including a  review of the \nCommission's ~nnual Report,  the 90-day notice period is \ninsufficient to enable the Commission to conduct its \ninvestigations and formulate a  commission recommendation \non a  sitting judge.  This situation is particularly exas \nperating when  several judges corne  up for reappointment at \nthe same time.\"  In addition,  the Bar Study found that \ncurrently the Tenure Commission requests that judges \nVoluntarily declare their intention six months before \n1 \ntheir terms expire.:\nThe D.C.  Superior Court Board of Judges agrees \nwith this recommendation. \n*1  For additional explanation see pp.  862-63 of the \nHorsky Committee Study,  S.

The amendment implements Recom \nmendation No.  29  of the Court Organization Report of the \nHorsky Committee Study which found  \"little value in re \ntaining the two automatic reappointment categories for \n\n131 \nevaluating judges'  performance.\"  In fact,  the designation \nhas no effect on reappointment.  Under the current version \nof the statute, it makes no difference whether a  judge is \nrated as \"exceptionally well-qualified\" or simply \"well-\nqualified. \" \nThe Horsky Committee St?dy also found that only \na  small number of Superior Court judges were designated as \n\"exceptionally well-qualified\" while \"virtually every \nappellate judge\" has been rated \"exceptionally well \nqualified.\"  The Study concluded that the distinction \nwas based on the relative lack of difficulty of assessing \nthe productivity and qualification of appellate judges \nas opposed to trial jUdges.~/ \nThe D.C.  Superior Court Board of Judges agrees \nwith the recommendation. \ns*./   See pp.  863-64 of the Horsky Committee Study, \nPrt.  98-34. \n\n132 \nITEH NO.9 \nRecommendation No.  30  of the Statuto~y Courts Report \nTo  give authority to periodically adjust \nsmall claims ceiling. \nAmendment \nAmend  Section 1321 of title 11 of the Di3trict of \nColumbia Coce to read  [amendment in brackets) : \nThe Small Clauus and Conciliation \nBranch has exclusive jurisdiction of any \naction within the jurisdiction of the \nSuperior Court which is only for the \nrecovery of money,  if the amount in \ncontroversy does  not exceed $2,000, \nexclusive of interest,  attorney fees, \nprotest fees,  and costs.  [The Council of \nthe District of Columbia is hereby author-\nized to review and to change the jurisdic-\ntional amount by legislation from time to \ntime.] \npurpose \nThe recently enacted Public Law 98-598 raised the \n-D.C.  Superior Court's small claims jurisdiction from $750 \nto $2,000.  That substantially carried out Recommendation \nNo.  29  of the Statutory Courts Report of the Horsky Com-\nmittee Study.  It was  the first inc~ease in the Court's \n\n133 \nstatutory jurisdiction over small claims since 1970,  a \nfourteen year period.  (The neighboring jurisdictions \npresently have higher jurisdictional limits for their \ncourts equivalent to the P.C,  Small Claims Branch - \n$5,000 in Fairfax County,  Virginia,  and $10,000  in \nMontgomery and Prince George's Cou:nties, Maryland.) \nThe new $2,000 ceiling for the D.C.  Small Claims Branch \nhas resulted in an immediate rise in the caseload of \nthis Branch,  and should enable many  citizens and \nbusinesses with small civil cases to have their \ndisputes adjudicated more quickly than before. \nThe amendment now proposed has as its basis \nRecommendation No.  30  of the Statutory. Courts Report \nof the Horsky Committee Study.  The Horsky Committee \nStudy had recommended legislation allowing the \nSuperior Court to change the jurisdictional ceiling \nperiodically  (see p,  700,  S.  Prt.  98-34),  and the \nSuperior Court Board of Judges agreed with that \nrecommendation.  It is arguable,  however, that the \nlegislative process of the Council of the District of \nColu:rnbia may  be better suited to resolving the various \nconsiderations involved in periodically revising the \njurisdictional ceiling.  Accordingly,  the amendment \nwould have the Congress delegate legislative authority \nto amend the D.C.  small claims ceiling to the Council \nof the District of Colu:rnbia. \n\n134 \nITEM NO.  10 \nRecommendation No.  8  of the Probate Court Report \n- To  integrate,  statutorily, the Auditor \nMaster's office wii:i1j.n the Probate \nDivision of the D.C.  Superior Court. \nAmendment \nThis amendment would carry out the Borsky Committe~ \nStudy recommendation for merging the audit staffs of the \nAuditor-Master and the Register of wills in the Probate \nDivision. \nSection 1724 of title 11  of the District of \nColumbia Code  is amended by omitting the phrase \n\"(1)  audit and state fiduciary a,ccounts\"  and by \nrenumbering the remaining clauses as  (1)  and  (2). \nAs  so amended section 1724 would read in \npertinent part: \nThere shall be an Auditor Master of th(~ \nsuperior Court who  shall  (1)  execute orders \nof reference referred by the Superior Court \nand perform duties in accordance with Rule \n53  of the Federal Rules of civil Procedure \nor other applicable rule,  and  (2)  perform \nsuch other functions as may be assigned by \nthe Superior Court.  • \nSection 2104  of title 11 of the District of \ncolumbi~ Code is amended by deleting the word \n\n135 \nby \n\"and\"  at the end of subsection {al (2),  striking \nthe period at the end of subsection  (a) (3)  and re \nplacing the same with a  semicolon and the word \"and\", \nand by adding the following new phrase at the end \nof subsection  (a)!  \"(';)  audit and state fiduciary \naccounts.\" \nPurpose \nAt the time of the D.C.  Bar study af the Superior \nCourt,  the Auditor-Master was  conducting audits and pre \nparing audit reports for the Superior Court on all \nfiduciary accounts other than probate and guardianship \naccounts.  He  also audited those trust accounts remaining \nin U.S.  District Court.  The office of the Register of \nWills,  in the Probate Division,  handles the. accounts \nof decedents'  estates and guardianship. \nThe Horsky Committee Study noted that the \nAuditor-Master's office had developed a  substantial \nbacklog of accounts,  while,  at the time of the Study, \nthe Register of Wills office was up-to-date.  The study \nconcluded that \"it is inappropriate for the Auditor \nMasteT of the D.C.  Superior Court to continue to \nserve the U.S.  District Court in matters of reference \nand account.\" \nThe amendment removes the requirement that the \nAuditor-Master audit and state fiduciary accounts and \n.. \n\n136 \nauthorizes the Register of Wills to perform that function. \nThe Horsky committee study also recommended that the \nsuperior Court should \"merge the regular audit staffs of \nthe Auditor-Master and the Register of Wills under a \nconsolidated Probate Division.\"  The amendment makes \nthat merger possible with the efficiency the Study \nbelieved would result.~/  In fact the merger has taken \nplace and the statutes should be changed to reflect \nthe fact. \n*/  For a more detailed explanation see pp.  764-68 \nof the Horsky committee study,  s.

Bar as a  resul't of \ninquiries received from the United states court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit.  It would permit \nthat Court and any other United States Court of Appeals, \nthe Supreme Court of tl1e United states, and the highest \ncourt of any state to certify questions of District of \nColumbia law to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals \nwhich would have discretion to act on the certification. \nInformation was obtained from the National \n~enter for State Courts about experiemce under the uniform \nAct.  Also,  the Corporation Counsel's office supplied \ninformation as to the possible case load that might re \nsult from adoption of the proposal.  That information \nwas considered by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals \nand the informal legislative group has been advised that \nthat Court has no objection to the proposed legislation \nso long as it provides -- as the proposed language does \nthat \n1)  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals \nhas discretion to decide whether to act on the certifi \ncation,  and \n2)  Certification is limited to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, the united states Courts of \nAPpeals,  and the highest courts of the states. \nAdoption of the proposal would provide a means \nfor obtaining -- without unduly burdening the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals -- authoritative resolution of \nundecided questions·of District of Columbia law that may \nbe determinative of proceedings pending in the certifying \ncourt. \n\n142 \nMr. DYMALLY.

Clause 17 grants hybrid powers to Congress, \nand thus is a unique source of congressional authority, distincl from Con. \ngress' other section 8 powers of purely national scope.\" When Congr~! \nlegislates under\"j(s other section-8 powers, it creates \"laws of the United \nStates\" falling within the Article In \"arising under\" jurisdiction, which it \nmay choose to  enforce in Arlicle 1Il  courts. Congress may also create \n\"laws of the United States\" under clause 17, and does so when it promul. \ngates rules to protect the functioning of the national government. \nA major com ponent of Congress' clause 17 power, however, is the au \nthority to enact local laws for the District. Two factors differentiate be \ntween the types of laws that may be enacted under clause 17. First, as to \nsubject matter, the scope of local  Jaws  may  be much greater than  the \n\"laws of the United States,\" As the Supreme Court has noted, the enact \nment of the D.C. Code \"would exceed [Congress'] powers, , . in the \ncontext of national legislation enacted under other powers delegated to it \nunder Art, I, § 8.\"\" Second, local laws, unlike federal laws, must be con \nfined  in application  to a limited geographical area. Congress itself has \nrecognized the intuitive distinction between federal and local laws, by cod· \nifying the D.C. Code separately from the U.S. Code. Even as a mailer of \nhistory, the two types of laws are distinct: The first local laws for the \nDistrict were the laws of the ceding states, which Congress adopted in \ntoto,\" only gradually reshaping them over the years to meet the changing \nt)  P.tm<>n: Y.

If the laws emanating only \nrrom  the  first source, Congre$S, arc considered \"federal\" and  therefore \nwithin Article III court \"arising under\" jurisdiction, arbitrary distinctions \nin the interpretation of District local law WQuid result. \nThe needed  consistency is possible only if local congressional enact \nments arc treated as local law. It is implausible to interpret District law \ninstead as a uniform body of federal law.

The Gibbs Requirements in the Civil Context \n~ \nUnder Gibbs, the Tederal court has no subject maher jurisdiction over \nany case in which the federal claims are insubstantial, 10' Even when Ihc \ncourt has jurisdictional power, it should elCercise its discretion to refuse to \nadjudicate certain local claims. For example, when all federal claims are \ndismissed  befofe trial, the local  District claims should be dismissed as \nwell 1,1 The action should also be dismissed when a District claim raises a \nnovel and unsettled issue of lawito. the: federal court should allow local \ncourts the opportunity to first decide the issue,'o, since the District of Co \nlumbia, like the states, is entitled to an internally COnSistent elaboration of \nI'\" \nits Jaw by its own courts.

Disparity of Outcome Among US. CooeVioiators \nUsing section 11-502(3), the federal p=tor is able 10 circumvent a \nU.s. Code hitran:hy oC greater and lesser-included charges and penalties. \nThe prosecutor may charge a Di~trict defendant with a greater federal \noffense in one count, and with a lesser D.C. Code offense, instead of the \nparaH'!! U.S. Code provision, in a scco'nd count, mindful of the fact iliat \nthe local provision carries a greater maximum penalty than ill federal \ncounterpart. In this way, the prosecutor ensures that if the defendant is \nconvicted of both charges, he may receive a total sentence longer than the \nmaximum authorized und'.er the federal :K:heme.1U Alternatively, if the \ngreater offense cannot be proved at trial, or if the defendant pleads guilty \nto the lesser charge as part of a plea bargain, lhe defendant will receiye a \nharsher punishment than similar derendants in other federal courts who \ncan be charged only under the U.S. Code. The district court compounds \nthe problem of disparate treatment for District defendants by on =ion \napplying D,C. Code provision, to the trial or joined D.C. and U.S. Code \noffenses, or even of 'U.S. Code offenses alone.I\"  Although the D.C. Cir· \n139.  Unioed Min. Wo\",on y.

Because of the current \nambiguous statu, of District local law, prosecutors and judges may con \nstrue thaI law at whim as either federal1)f local. Criminal defendants in \nthe District. arc particularly prejUdiced by this easy definitional manipula \ntion, since the usc of either federal or local standards at any stage of the \ncriminal justice proc:ess, Crom bail to parole, may easily be justified. The \nsaCest way to prevent these ill effects is to establish three presumption5. \nFirst, when Congress enacts laws of nationwide applicability, it should \nnol be permitted to single out District residents for different treatment, \nusing the: jU~lification that its powers over the District are :'plenary\" in \nnature:. Second, when Congress exercises its authority as a stale legislature \nfor the Dislrict;it shOUld thoose to be bound by ronslilutional principles \nthat define and delimit the relationship between states and their citi;zens. \nThird, the principles that govern  the interactions between federal  and \nstate courts also should govern the dual court system in the District. \nThese presumptions wpuld bring to light and hold up for scrutiny legis \nlation like section 11-502(3). which is inconsistent with the presumptions \nof uniformity and of a federal-state: court relationship, and which in addi \ntion creates classifications that discriminate against District residents. In \nview of the longstanding restrictions upon the exercise by District resi \ndents of political rights, as well as their inability (1) effect a repeal of \nsection t t -502(3) or to prevent its usc by the United States Attorney,'\" \nthese classifications must be judged with particular scrutiny.'\" The D.C. \nCircuit has held that u[ill is  not enough  for such classifications to be \nmerely rational or even plausible; the justificatioh offered must actually be \nconvincing.\"\"· Section 11-502(3) joinder does not meet this ,requirement. \n\\67.  p.,C.

Courts,  Lawyers,  and  the  Administration  of  Justice  of  the \nD.C.  Bar  and  not  those  of  the  D.C.  Bar  or  of  its  Board  of \nGovernocs.~ \n\n180 \nThe Legislation  Committee  of Division  IV  of the District of \nColumbia  Bar I  which  is  concerned  wi th  courts,  lawyers  and  the \nadministration of  justice,  has  studied  the  Dist~ict of  Columbia \nProsecutorial and  Judicial Efficiency Act of  1985 which would  (1) \nrequire  cdminal  prosecutions  in  the  Superior  Court  of  the \nPistrict of Columbia to be brought in the name  of the District of \nColumbia  (5  2{d)};  (2)  provide  for  the  assignment  of  assistant \ncorporation Counsels as special assistant United States attorneys \n(§  2ee»;  (3)  make  permanent  the  authority  of  hearing \ncommissioners  (§  3li  (4)  amend  provisions  of  the  D.C.  Code \nrega~ding  the  appointment,  tenure  ana  responsibilities  of \njudicial  personnel  (§§  4,6-9,11-16);  (5)  repeal  the  \"SUper\" \ndisbarment provision of the D.C.  Code  (§  5);  and  (6)  provide for \n'-~he certification of questions of local law from appellate courts \n\\:0  the District of Columbia Court of Appeals  (§  10). \nThe  Legislation  committee  strongly  supports,  for  reasons \nmore  fully  stated  below,  sectior;\"  four  and  five  and  sections \neight through sixteen of the proposed bill.  It takes no position \non  the  other  provisions  because  (lJ  it has  not  had  sUffioient \nopportunity  to  consider  them  and  (2)  it may  be  more  appropriate \nfor  other  Divisions  of  the  D.C.  Bar  to  comment  on  them. \nMoreover,  because  the  sections  of  the  bill discussed  below  are \nnon-controversial,  the Legislation Committee  recommends  that they \nbe  considered  separately  from  those  provisions  dealing  with \ncriminal prosecutions.  Finally,  the Legislation Committee  notes \n\n181 \nthat section six, which raises the  retirement age  for  judges, was \n. already  the  subject  of  a  bill  which  became  law  last year  and, \ntherefore,  should be deleted from  this bill. \n1.  Sections 4 and  8-16.  Judicial Bfficiency Provisions. \nThese  provisions  seek  to  implement  recommendations  of  the \nDistrict  of  Columbia  Court  System  Study  Committee,  under  the \nchairmanship  of  Charles  A.  Borsky  and  an  informal  legislative \nt \ngroup  created  a't  the  invitation  of  the  Council  for  Court \nExcellence and the D.C.  Bar's Committee for  the Implementation of \nthe  Borsky  Committee  Study.  Section  10,  which  concerns \ncertifications of  questions  of  law  to  the  District of  Columbia \ncourt of Appeals and was  drafted by  the Legislation committee as \nan  additional  recommendation,  was  not  one  of  the  original \nrecommendations o£  the Borsky Committee:  We  submit the following \ncomments  on  some of these sections: \nSection 4 would amend D.C.  Code  §  11-1703(b)  and provide the \nDistrict of Columbia Court System with  the authority to select an \nExecutive  Officer  for  the  Courts  from  any  group  of  qualified \nindividuals  rather  than  being  limited  to  a  list of  candidates \nchosen by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts.  we  support  this amendment which  gives  the  local \ncourts  more  discretion  and  greater  responsibility  for  managing \nwhat is a  local function. \nSection  10  incorporates  legislation  recommended  by  the \nLegislation  r.ommittee  for  improvement  in  the  administration  of \njustice  in  the  District  of  columpia  by  enabling  questions  of \n- 2 -\n\n182 \nlocal law  to  be  certified  to  the  District  of  Columbia  Court  of \nAppeals  from  other  appellate  courts.  The  section  is  patterned \nafter  the  Uniform  Certification  of  Questions  of  Law  Act,  12 \nU.L.A.  Civil Proc.  and  Rem.  Laws  at 52.  As  of January  1983,  the \nprovisions of the Uniform Act had  been adopted by  rule or statute \nin  twenty-two  states.  From  a  stUdy of all reported  decisions by \nthe  United  States Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District of Columbia \nCircuit since 1980,  it appears that, of the 78  decisions applying \nlocal  law,  fourteen  of  the  Court I S  recent  decisions  would  have \nbeen  candidates  for  certification.  These  decisions  required \ninterpretation  and  application  of  local  law  in  the  absence  of \ncontrolling  precedent  by  the  local  courts.  The  Leg islation \nCommittee believes that consistent interpretation of local law is \nbest  served  by  providing  the  D.C.  Court  of  Appeals  with  a \nmechanism whereby it can  resolve the local law issues itself when \nthey  are  determinative  of  litigation  in  other appellate  courts. \nSection 10  provides such a  mechanism. \nSections  11  and  12  are concerned with the  selection process \nof the D.C.  Judicial Nominations Commission.  Section 11  provides \nthat  the  records  of  the  Judicial  Nominations  Commission  are \npriviledged and  exempt  from  freedom of  information act requests, \nand  section  12  provides  that meetings  of  the  Commission  may  be \nclosed to  the public.  These  amendments  to  the  current process, \nwe  believe,  will  ensure  fair  and  effective decisionmaking.  The \nLegislation Comwittee  recommends adoption of these prOVisions. \n- 3 -\n\n183 \n2.  Section 5.  Repeal of Automatic Disbarment Provisions. \nThe  Legislation  Committee  supports  repeal  of  D.C.  Code  § \n11-2503  (1981).  That  section  has  been  construed  by  the  District \nof  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  to  require  the  automatic  and \npermanent  disbarment  of  any  attorney  convicted  of  a  crime  of \nmoral tut:pitude.  See  In  re Colson,  412  A.2d  1160  (D.C.  1979)(en \nbanc);  In  re  Kerr,  424  A.2d  94  (D.C.  1980) (en  banc).  The \nCoromi ttee  believes  that because  §  11-2503  permits  no  exceptions \nit  is  not  necessarily  consistent  with  the  administration  of \njustice in the  District.  We  know  of  no  other  jurisdiction which \nmandates  permanent  disbarment,  and  the  section's  application  to \nonly  attorneys  ·convicted\"  of  crimes  of  moral  turpitude  creates \ninconsistencies  in  the  discipline  of  attorneys  admitted  to \npractice  in  the  Distt:ict  of  Columbia.  Instead,  in  accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  section  15  of  Rule  XI  of  the  Rules \nGoverning  the  Bar  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District of \nColumbia  and  DR  1-102(A)(4)  of  the  Code  of  Professional \nResponsibility,  the  imposition of sanctions  should  be made  on a \ncase-by-case  basis.  Moreover,  it is  the  Committee's  opinion \nthat, even if ad hoc consideration is not considered appropriate, \nthe  gues tion  of  whether  or  not  an  attorney  shOUld  be \nautomatically and  permanently disbarred after being  convicted of \na  crime of moral turpitude is a  judgment that should be left open \nto the  District of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals.  Repeal  of  §  11-\n2503 provides the Court with this responsibility. \n- 4 -\n\n184 \nThe  inconsistency  in discipline  referred  to  above  concerns \n• the of;act that §  11-2503  only applies  to members  of  the  D.C.  Bar \nconvicted  of  a  crime  of  moral  turpitude.  An  atto[\"ney  who  has \ncommitted such an offense but has  not been convicted  need  not be \nautomatically  or  permanently  disbarred.  Similarly i  someone  who \nwas  convicted  of  a  crime  of  moral  turpitude  before  becoming  a \nmember  of  the  D.C.  Bar  is  not  precluded  from  applying  for \nadmission  to  the  Bar.  See  In  re Manville,  494  A.2d  1289  (D.C. \n1985.  The  drastic effects of  §  11-2503  also  seem  to  result  in \nefforts  by  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  to  find, \nwherever  possible,  that  a  particular  conviction  was  not  for  a \ncrime of moral  turpitude. \nIn  sum,  the Legislati(>n  Committee  strongly  supports  repeal \nof D.C.  Code  §  11-25C3 because whatever measures are belived most \nappropriate for  the discipline  of members  of  the D.C.  Bar should \nbe  left  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  to \ndetermine. \nMr. DYMALLY.

BAR  COURTS  STUDY IMPLE· \nMENTATION COMMITTEE \nSTATEMENT OF CHARLES A. HORSKY \nMr. HORSKY. Mr. Chairman, perhaps I might begin by identifying \nthe Council for Court Excellence of which I am the president. It is \na local civic organization composed of concerned citizens from the \nlegal. business, civic and judicial communities. One of our organiza~ \ntional purposes include fostering better public understanding of the \njudicial system in the District, and promoting reform and improve· \nments in the administration of justice in the local courts. \n\n185 \nI would like to begin by expressing our appreciation to this sub \ncommittee and to its fme staff for your ongoing commitment to de \nveloping legislative means to improve the quality of justice and the \neffectiveness of the District of Columbia courts. The bills before the \ncommittee this morning are evidence of the breadth of need and \nconcern of your committee and the Congress in this area. \nThe council appears before you today in support of the general \n.. \nthrust and direction of H.R. 3370. Under the leadership of a special \ncommittee convened by John Pickering, members of our board of \ndirectors have worked closely over the past year with the office of \nthe Mayor,  officials of the local and Federal courts, appropriate \ncongressional  committee  staff,  and  others  in  furtherance  of  a \nnumber of items in H.R. 3370. \nAdditionally, the genesis for a number of the items in this bill \nwas an earlier major study by the D.C. Bar, the District of Colum \nbia Court Study Committee. We studied the effects of the District \nof Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 and \nissued a series of nine reports, subsequently published by the U.S. \nSenate Committee on Governmental Affairs. Twelve of the legisla \ntive proposals before you today emanate from that bar effort, as \nsubsequently reviewed and considered by the committee Mr. Pick \nering chaired. I  would like to  comment briefly on each of those \nitems. \nSection 3,  dealing with hearing commissioners is the first one. \nWhile we understand and support the underlying need for a per \nmanent authorization for hearing commissioners in the superior \ncourt, we believe the legislative proposals now before the commit \ntee should be amended in three specific areas: appointment proce \ndure, position security) and disciplinary procedures. \nIn general, Mr. Chairman, we favor an appointment and position \nsecurity procedure for the hearing commissioners in superior court \nsimilar to that adopted earlier by the U.S. Congress for U.S. magis \ntrates. As was just recently stated, the hearing commissioners are \npatterned on the U.S, magistrate system, and we think they should \nbe parallel. \nSpecifically, we favor an 8-year-fixed-term appointment, and the \nrelated  magistrate  appointment  and  reappointment  provisions \nwhich require a concurrence of a majority of the active judges in \nthe District following use of an iI~dependent merit selection panel \ncomposed of residents of the judicial district to assist the court in \nidentifying and recommending the best qualified candidates. \nFinally, we recommend that this bill provide that hearing com· \nmissioners, as judicial officers who hear a variety of matters speci \nfied within the D.C. Code and elsewhere, come within the judicial \ndiscipline and conduct regulations and oversight of the canons of \njudicial ethics  and of the  D.C.  Judicial  Disabilities  and Tenure \nCommission, just as the Congress earlier provided for all other judi\" \ncial officers in the superior court. \nThe rationale for our proposed amendments concerning hearing \ncommissioners are several. First, regarding the method of appoint~ \nment, the proposed bill provides that the chief judge appoint and \nremove these individuals. The procedures adopted by the Congress \nregarding the appointment and screening of candidates for  posi-\n\n186 \ntions as  U.S.  magistrates,  as outlined above,  we believe  to be a \nmuch better system. \nWe  also  understand that the hearing commissioners currently \nserving in the court lack civil service safeguards such as are pro \nvided as a matter of course to other D.C. Superior Court staff. A \nfIxed  appointment term of suffIcient  duration,  such as  8  years, \nwould assure that this important segment of the court family is not \n.. \ninadvertently penalized  from  a  personnel  or job security stand \npoint. \nFinally, with regard to the inclusion of the hearing commission \ners under the existing D.C. Judicial Disabilities and Tenure Com \nmission authority, we suggest that as quasi-judicial offIcers it is \nmost appropriate that these court offIcers' conduct be covered in \nthis manner. This would be particularly true if the amendments \nsuggested by Mr. Polansky are adopted. I might also note that we \nlearned that the practice in this area in other States is that rull \ntime court employees who exercise judicial functions ona full-time \nbasis come within the jurisdiction of the independent judicial con \nduct agency. \nSection 4, dealing with the appointment of the executive offIcer, \nwe support. Section 4 is consistent with the recommendations of \nthe Court Organization Report of the D.C. Bar's committee referred \nto earlier, and the D.C. Superior Court Board of Judges favor this \nnotion of local judicial discretion and responsibility for selection of \nthe D.C. courts' administrator. \nWith  respect  to  section  8,  the  court  supports  the  provisions, \nwhich I might note in large degree have been effectively accom \nplished earlier through action of Superior Court Chief Judge Moul \ntrie. The provision is necessary, really, to bring the practice and \nthe underlying legislative authorization in line with each other. \nThese issues have been focused on and agreed to by both D.C. Bar \ncommittees and the D.C. Superior Court Board of Judges. \nThe requirement relating to judicial fmancing reporting, though \nmodest in language, has important workload implications for both \na Federal judicial review committee and for our D.C. court judges. \nWe  strongly  support  this  section,  which  would  eliminate  the \npresent duplicate fmancial reporting filing requirement to which \njudges of the superior court and the D.C. Court of Appeals are now \nsubjected. D.C. court judges would continue to be subject to the re \nporting requirements of the D.C.  Judicial Disabilities and Tenure \nCommission. \nWith regard to sections 11, 12, and 13, the council supports the \nseveral proposed changes in the Judicial Nomination Commission's \nprocesses. We believe the values of public access provided for by \nthe D.C. Freedom of Information Act must be balanced with the \nneed for the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission to receive and \nconsider confidential information for  decisionmaking purposes at \neach stage of the judicial nomination process. \nThe reforms will ensure the necessary protections to render the \nselection process more effective, and allow for public input at the \nappropriate stage of judicial nominations in the District. Both the \nD.C.  Court System Study Committee and the D.C.  Courts Imple \nmentation Committee  reports  concur on these three issues.  The \nBoard of Judges of the D.C. Superior Court supports the fIrst two \n\n187 \nproposals, and has voiced no opinion on the proposal to announce \njudicial nominations publicly at the time they are sent to the Presi-\ndent.  . \nSections 14, 15, and 16 we support, to give the Tenure Commis \nsion and the Judicial Nomination Commission greater facility to \nshare information regarding judges between the two groups. In ad \ndition, we suppm:t the change in the notice period of from 3 months \nto 6 months for judges to notify the Tenure Commission regarding \ntheir intent as to an additional term. \nFinally, section 16 provides a much needed refinement in the ex \nisting statutory judicial reappointment evaluation categories. The \nproposal now before the committee in this regard is, we believe, an \nappropriate  remedy  to  an  unnecessary  and  potentially  divisive \nevaluation standard for reappointing judges. \nEach of the proposals in 14, 15, and 16 were considered by the \nCourt Organization Report of the D.C. Bar's Court System Study \nCommittee,  and supported by both the D.C.  Courts Study Imple \nmentation Committee and the D.C. Superior Court Board of Judges. \nWhile the Council for Court Excellence supports the main thrust \nof this bill and many of its components, may I al:'·k you, Mr. Chair \nman, to consider the amendments we have suggested to the provi \nsions concerning hearing commissioners.  A copy of our proposed \namendments is attached to the statement which I have submitted \nto the committee. Thank you. \n[The prepared statement of Mr. Horsky follows:] \n56-728 0 - 86 - 7 \n\n188 \nSTATEMENT OF  CHARLES  A.

The bills before the \ncommittee this morning are evidence of the breadth of need \nand concern of your committee and the Congress in this area. \nThe Council for Court Excellence appears before you \ntoday  in support of the general thrust and direction of \nH.R.  3370.  Under the leadership of a  special committee \n\n189 \n2 \nconvened by John H.  Pickering of the D.  C.  Bar, members \nof 0ur Board of Directors have worked closely over the \npast year with the office of the Hayor,  officials of the \nlocal and federal courts,  appropriate Congressional com \nmittee staff, and others in furtherance of a  number of \nthe legislative items contained in H.R.  3370.  Additionally, \nthe genesis for a  number of the items in this bill was  an \nearlier major study by the D.  C.  Bar,  the District of \nColumbia Court System Study Committee.  Over a four-year \nperiod,  we  studied the effects of the District of Columbia \nCourt Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 and issued \na  series of nine reports,  subsequently published by the \nU.  S.  Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,  Subcommittee \non Governmental Efficiency and the District of Columbia,  in \nApril 1983.  Twelve of the legislative proposals before you \ntoday emanate from that Bar effort, as subsequently reviewed \nand considered by the Committee Mr.  Pickering chaired.  I \nwould like to comment briefly on each of them. \nsection 3.  Hearing Commissioners \nlillile we  understand and support the underlying need \nfor a  permanent authorization for hearing commissioners in \nthe Superior Court of the District of columbia, we  believe \nthe legislative proposals now before the Committee should \nbe amended in three specific areas:  appointment procedure, \nposition security,  and disciplinary procedures. \n\n190 \n3 \nIn ~ene~al, Mr. Chairman, we favor an appointment and \nposition security procedure for the hearing commissioners \nin Superior Court similar to that adopted earlier by the \nU.  S.  Congress for U.  S.  Magistrates;  see 28  U.S.C. \n§§  631-639.  More specifically, we favor an eight-year \nfixed term appointment,  and the related magistrate appoint \nment and reappointment provision which requires a  concur \nrence of a majority of the active judges in the District \nfollowing use of an independent merit selection panel,  com \nposed of residents of the jUdicial dir,t.!:ici.:.,  to assist the \ncourt in identifying and recommending  the best qualified \ncandidates.  Finally, Mr.  Chairman, we  recommend that this \nbill provide that hearing commissioners,  as judicial \nofficers who  hear a variety of matters as specified within \nD.  C.  Code 11-1732, and elsewhere,  come within the judicial \ndiscipline and conduct regulations and oversight of the \nCanons of Judicial Ethics and of the D.  C.  Judicial Dis \nabilities and Tenure Commission,  just as the Congress \nearlier provided for all other judicial ofLicers in the \nSuperior Court. \nThe rationale for our proposed amendments  concerning \nhearing commissioners,  as outlined briefly above,  are \nseveral.  First, regarding the method of appointment of \nhearing commissioners,  the proposed bill provides that the \nchief judge of the superior Court appoint and remove these \nindividuals.  The procedures adopted by the U.  S. Congress \n\n191 \nr \n4 \nregarding the appointment and screening of candidates \nfor positions as U.  S. Magistrates,  as outlined above,  we \nbelieve to be a better system.  We  also understand that \nhearing commissioners currently serving in the Superior \nCourt lack civil service safeguards, such as are provided \nas a matter of course to other D.  C.  Superior Court staff. \nA fixed appointment term of sufficient duration, such as \neight years, would assure that this important segment of \nthe court family is not inadvertently penalized from a \npersonnel or job security standpoint.  Finally. with regard \nto the inclusion of the hearing commissioners under the \nexisting D.  C.  Judicial Disabilities and Tenure Commission \nauthority, we  suggest that as quasi-judicial officers it is \nmost appropriate that these court officers' conduct be \ncovered in this manner.  I  might also note that we  learned \nthat the practice in this area in the other states is that \nfull-time court employees who exercise judicial functions on \na full-time basis come within the jurisdiction of the \nindependent judicial conduct agency. \nSection 4.  Appointment of Executive Officer \nof the District of Columbia Courts \nThe Council for Court Excellence supports the proposed \nchanges  in Di,strict of Columbia ::ode 1l-l703 in this area. \nSection 4 of this bill is consistent with recommendations \nin the Court Organization Report of the D.  C.  Bar's \n\n·192 \n5 \nD.  C.  Court system Study Committee,  referred to earlier. \nI  should also note that the D.  C.  Superior Court Board of \nJudges favors  this notion of local judicial discretion \nand responsibility for selection of the D.  C.  Courts' \nadministrator. \nSection 8.  Reorganization of \nAudit Responsibility \nThe COUncil for Court Excellence supports the p~ovisions \nof Section 8,  which I  might note in large degree have effec \ntively been accomplished earlier through action of Superior \nCourt Chief Judge Moultrie.  The provision is necessary to \nbring the practice and the underlying legislative authoriza \n. tion in line with each other.  Also,  these issues have been \nfocused on and agreed to by both D.  C.  Bar committees and the \nD.  C.  Superior Court Board of Judges. \nSection 9.  Judicial Financial Reporting \nRequirements \nThis proposed section, though modest in language, has \nimportant workload implications for both a  federal judicial \nreview committee and for our D.  C.  Courts judges.  We \nstrongly support the intent of this section, which would \neliminate the present duplicate financial reporting filing \nrequirement to which judges of the Superior Court and of the \nD.  C.  Court of Appeals are now sUbjected.  D.  C.  Courts \njudgea would continue to be SUbject to the repG:;ting \n\n193 \nrequirements of the D.  C.  Judicial Disabilities and Tenure \nCommission. \nSections 11, 12 and 13.  D.  C.  JUdicial \nNomination Commission \nWith regard to Sections 11, 12 and 13 of H.R.  3370,  the \nCouncil for c'ourt Excellence supports the several proposed \nchanges in the Judicial Nomination Commission's processes. \nWe  believe the values of public access provided for by the \nD.  C.  Freedom of Information Act must be balanced with the \nneed for the D.  C.  Judicial Nomination commission to receive \nand consider confidential information for decision-making \npurposes at each stage of the judicial nomination process. \nThe reforms will ensure the necessary protections to render \nthe selection process more effective, and allow for public \ninput at the appropriate stages of  judicial nominations in \nthe District of Columbia.  Both the D,  C.  Court System Study \ncommittee and the D.  C.  Courts Implementation Committee \nReports concur on these three issues.  The Board of Judges \nof .,!--he D:' C'.  'Supi1;ior Court supports the first two proposals, \nand has voiced no opinion on the proposal ,to announce judi-\ncial nominations pUblicly at the time they are sent to the \nPresident. \nSections 14, 15 and 16.  D.  C.  JUdicial Disabilities \nand Tenure Commission \nThe Council for Court Excellence supports amendment of \nthe D.  C.  Code as proposed in section 14 to give the Tenure \n\n194 \ncommission and the D.  C.  Judicial Nomination Commission \ngreater facility to share information regarding judges \nbetween the two groups.  In addition, we support the change \nin the notice period of from three months to six months for \njudges to notify the tenure commission regarding their intent \nas to an additional term.  Fip~lly, Section 10 of the bill \nprovides a much needed refin~nent in the existing statutory \njudicial reappointment evaluation categories.  The proposal \nnow before the committee in this regard is, we  believe,  an \nappropriate remedy to an unnecessary and potentially divisive \nevaluation standard for reappointing judges. \nEach of the proposals contained in Sections 14, 15 and \n16 of H.R.  3370 was  considered in the Court Organization \nReport of the D.  C.  Bar's Court System Study committee, \nmentioned above,  and supported by both the D.  C.  Courts \nStudy Implementation Committee and the D.  C.  Superior \nCourt Board of Judges. \nWhile the Council for Court Excellence supports the \nmain thrust of this bill and many of its components, may \nI  again ask you,  Mr.  Chairman and Members of the Committee, \nto consider the amendments we  have suggested to the pro \nvisions concerning Hearing Commissioners. \nThank you again for permi~ting me  to speak to you today. \nI  would be happy to answer any questions at this time. \n\n195 \nThe Council for Court Excellence \nPROPOSED  AMENO~S \n11-1732.  Hearing Commissioners \n(a)  The j.udges of the D.  C.  Superior Court shall appoint hearing \ncommissioners who  shall serve in the Superior Court and shall \nperform the duties enumera.ted in subsection  (d)  of this section \nand such other duties as are consistent with the Constitution \nand laws of the United States and of the District of Columbia \nand are assigned by rule of the Superior Court.  The appointment \nshall be by the concurrence of a majority of all \njudges in active service on the Superior Court.  Absent con \ncurrence of all judges in active service,  appointment shall be \nby the Chief Judge of the Superior Court. \n(b)  Hearing commissioners shall be selected pursuant to standards \nand procedures approved by the Superior Court Board of Judges \nwhich shall contain provision for public notice of all vacancies \nin hearing commissioner positions and for the establishment of \na  merit selection panel,  composed of lawyer and non-lawyer \nresidents of the District of Columbia who  are not employees of \nthe Court,  to assist the Court in identLfying and recommend-\ning persons who  are best qualified to fill such positions. \n(c)  No  individual may be appointed or serve as a hearing \ncommissioner under this section unless he or she has been a \nmember of the Bar of the District of Columbia for at least three \nyears. \n(d)  A hearing commissioner may perform the following functions: \nsame as subsections under original paragraph  (c) \n(e)  The appointment of any individual as a  hearing commissioner \nshall be for a  term of eight years. \n(f)  Removal of a  hearing commissioner during the term for which he \nor she is appointed shall be only for incompetency, misconduct, \nneglect of duty, or physical or mental disability. \n(g)  Hearing commissioners shall be subject to the provisions of \n11  D.  C.  Code  1521-1530  (1981 ed.  as amended)  g~Nerning \nthe authority of the D.  C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities \nand Tenure to suspend, remove or retire a  judge and shall abide \nby the Canons of JUdicial Ethics. \n\n196 \nMr.  DYMALLY.  Mr.  Horsky,  we  note with interest your recom \nmended amendments and the committee will take that under ad \nvisement. \nMr. HORSKY. Thank you. \nMr. DYMAl.LY. Now we will turn to Mr. Pickering. Then we will \ncome back and ask some questions. \nSTA'l'EMENT OF JOHN H. PICKERING \nMr. PICKERING. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \nI  am pleased to  appear before the committee this morning in \ngeneral support of H.R. 3370. My formal testimony is on behalf of \nthe D.C. Bar's D.C. Courts Study Implementation Committee which \nI chair. I should emphasize that I am speaking for that committee, \nnot for the bar or for its board of governors, consistent with our \npolicy. \nH.R.  3370  contains  a  number  of provisions  which  will  help \nstrengthen and improve the functioning of the District of Columbia \ncourt system. While I will address myself more directly to several \nsections of the bill, I believe it is important for the record to reflect \nthat many of the proposals in H.R. 3370 emanate from the major 4-\nyear evaluation study of the D.C. courts, chaired by an ad hoc com \nmittee of the D.C. Bar which Mr. Horsky chaired. The fmal report \nof that study was printed by the U.S. Senate Committee on Govern \nmental Affairs in April 1983, as Senate Print 98-34. \nThe Horsky committee study of the D.C. courts made numerous \nrecommendations for improvement in the courts. Each of the stud \nies was reviewed by the judges of the D.C. courts, and by the bar \ncommittee which I chair. I am pleased to report many of the rec \nommendations  have  been  implemented  administratively by  the \nD.C. courts themselves, and we are particularly appreciative of the \ntime and attention given by Chief Judge H.  Carl Moultrie, first, \nand Judge George Goodrich, who chaired the superior court's com \nmittee to review the many recommendations of the Horsky study. \nFinally in the way of opening remarks, I should also note that \nover the past 15 months the bar committee which I chair has been \nparticipating with the Council for Court Excellence and with repre \nsentatives of the Federal and local judiciary and court administra \ntion, the executive branch of the D.C. government, U.S.  attorney \nfor the District, committee staff from affected congressional com \nmittees, and others to study and determine the neces~ ;ty of legiula \ntive action on a number of the improvement recommendations of \nthe Horsky committee that are before this committee now in H.R. \n3370. \nA list of the persons invited to participate in this informal group, \nmost of whom did so, has been submitted with my statement, and I \nask that it be inserted in the record. The work of this group result \ned in a general consensus on 12 legislative proposals which are ex \nplained in a  memoranduln dated April 18,  1985.  Copies  of that \nmemorandum also have been furnished with my statement, and I \nrequest that it also be made part of the record of this hearing. \nWe are pleased that H.R. 3370 incorporates 10 of our 12 legisla \ntive proposals. This is done in sections 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, \nand 16 of the bill. Our bar implementation committee supports and \n\n197 \nendorses these sections and urges their enactment. I shall not dis \ncuss them in detail since the background and the need for each is \nfully explained in the memorandum I  have submitted. Indeed, I \nwant to note my agreement with what Mr. Horsky has said about \nthe bill, and to comment briefly 011 the following sections: \nFirst, section 10.  This provides for  certification of questions of \nlaw. It is patterned after the Uniform Certification of Law Act, \nwhich has been adopted by statute or court rule in 24 States. The \nneed for it was suggested by the Legislative Committee of Division \nN  of the bar as a result of inquiries from the U.S. Court of Ap \npeals for the D.C. Circuit. I would permit that court of appeals, any \nother U.S. Court of Appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the high \nest court of any State to certify questions of District of Columbia \nlaw to the D.C.  Court of Appeals which would have discretion to \nact on the certification. Adoption of this proposal by the Congress \nwould provide a means for obtaining authoritative resolution of un \ndecided questions of D.C.  law that may be determinative of pro \nceedings pending in the certifying court. Our group got informa \ntion, and that information was supplied by the National Center for \nState Courts and the Corporation Counsel's Office, and that infor \nmation indicates that this provision would not be used often and \nwould not burden the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. That \ncourt has studied the matter; it agrees and has no objection to the \nproposal. \nFinally,  on  sections  11,  12,  and  13,  these  represent,  as  Mr. \nHorsky has indicated, a consensus on the proper balance between \nthe public right to participate in the judicial selection process and \nthe need for confidentiality so the Judicial Nomination Commission \ncan get the best and most adequate information to do its job. We \nrealize that some parts of these three proposals might be adopted \nby the Council for the District of Columbia. We will, of course, sup \nport that. However, as explained in the memorandum I have sub \nmitted for the record, there is doubt that the council could do all \ni.hllt  is  required,  so  congressional  action is  proposed since  there \nhave to be other areas in which this bill rests. \nWhile we are pleased that 10 of' our 12 proposals are included in \nH.R. 3370, we are disappointed that two of them are not. We urge \nthe committee to include them also. They are items 2 and 9 of the \nmemorandum I have submitted. \nItem 2 would give the Judicial Nomination Commission 60,  in \nstead of' 30, days to process nominations. This committee recognized \nthe need for this additional time when it allowed 60 days for nomi \nnating  the seven additional judges in the last year or so.  This \nshould be made permanent as recommended by the Horsky study. \nIt is supported by the nomination commission, the courts, and our \nbar  committee.  It would  also  parallel  the  60  days  allowed  the \ntenure commission by section 15 of the bill. \nItem 9 would give the Council of the District of' Columbia author \nity periodically to adjust the jurisdictional ceiling for small claims. \nThis would give desirable flexibility, would relieve Congress of the \nneed to legislate on an essentially local matter, and is in line with \nhow the matter is handled in neighboring jurisdictions. We appreci \nate the fact that this committee a year ago did raise the jurisdic \ntional ceiling to $2,000 after a 14-year period when the level of the \n\n198 \nceiling was  unrealisth~ally low.  And we  think in line with home \nrule that this would be a desirable authority to give to the District \nof Columbia Council. \nMr.  Chairman, this completes my formal  statement. I  will  be \nglad to answer any questions you or the committee may have. \n[The prepared statement of Mr. Pickering follows:] \n\n199 \nTESTIMONY  OF  JOHN  H.  PICKERING,  CHAIRMAN \nD.C.  BAR  COURTS  STUDY  IMPLEMENTATION  COMMITTEE \nBEFORE  THE  JUDICIARY  AND  EDUCATION  SUBCOMMITTEE \nOF  THE  COMMITTEE  ON  THE  DISTRICT.OF  COLUMBIA,' \nU.S.  HOOSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES \nTHE  HONORABLE  MERVYN  M.  DYMALLY,  CHAIRMAN \nOCTOBER  1,  1985 \nMr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  pleased \nto appear  before you  this morning  in general  support of H.R. \n3370.  My  formal  testimony is on behalf of  the D.C.  Bar's D.C. \nCourts  Study Implementation Committee which  I  chair. \nH.R.  3370  contains a  number  of provisions which  will \nhelp strengthen and  improve  the  functioning  of  the District of \nColumbia Court System.  While I  will address myself more \ndirectly to  several sections of  the  bill, I  believe it is \nimportant  for  the  record  to  reflect that many  of  the  proposals \nin H.R.  3370  emanate  from  the major  four  year  evaluation study \nof the D.C.  Courts by an  ad  hoc  committee of  the D.C.  Bar, \nwhich Charles A.  Barsky chaired.  The  final  report of  that \nstudy was  printed by the U.S.  Senate Committee  on Governmental \nAffairs in April,  1983,  as Senate Print 98-34.  The  Horsky Com-\nmittee study of the D.C.  Courts made  numerous  recommendations \nfor  improvement  in  the Courts.  Each  of  the  studies was \nreviewed  by  the  judges of  the D.C.  Courts,  and  by the  committee \nof  the D.C.  Bar which  I  chair which  is concerned  with \nfacilitating  their implementation.  I  am  pleased  to  report  that \n\n200 \nmany of  the  recommendations  have  been  implemented  administra \ntively by  the D.C.  ';<iurts  themselves,  and  that we  are  particu \nlarly appreciative of the  time and  attention given by Chief \nJudge  B.  Carl  Moultrie  I  and  Judge George Goodrich,  who  chaired \nthe Superior  Court's Committee  to  review the many  recommenda \ntions of  the Borsky Study. \nFinally in  the  way  of opening  remarks,  I  should  also \nnote that over  the  past fifteen months  the  Bar  Committee  which \nI  chair has been participating with  the Council  for  Court \nExcellence  and  with  representatives of the  federal  and  local \njudiciary and  court administration,  the  Executive Branch  of  the \nD.C.  Government,  the U.S.  Attorney for  the District, committee \nstaff from affected Congressional  committees,  and  others  to \nstudy and  determine  the necessity of legislative action on  a \nnumber  of  the  court improvement recommendations  of  the  Borsky \nstudy  that are before  this Committee  in H.R.  3370. \nA list of  the  persons  invited' to  participate  in  this \ninformal group,  most of whom  did  so,  has  been  submitted with my \nstatement, and  I  ask  that it be  inserted  in  the  record.  The \nwork of this group resulted in  a general consensus on 12  legis \nlative proposals which are explained  in a .!lemorandum  dated \nApril 18,  1985.  Copies of  that memorandum  have  been  furnished \nto  the  Committee  and  I  request that it also be made  part of  the \nrecord  o~ this hearing. \n\n201 \nWe  are pleased  that H.R.  3370  incorporates 10  of our \n12 legislative proposals.  This  is done  in Sections 4,  8,  9, \n10,  II, 12,  13,  14, 15,  16  of the  bi£l.  Our  Bar  Implementation \ncommittee  supports and  endorses  these  sections and  urges  their \nenactment.  I  shall not discuss  these  sections in detail since \nthe  background  and  need  for  each  is fully explained  in  the mem \norandum I  have  submitted.  Instead  I  want  to  note my  agreement \nwith what Mr.  Horsky has  said about  the  bill, and  to  comment \nbriefly on  the  following  sections: \nSection 10 \nsection 10  of  the bill provides  for  certification of \nquestions of law.  It is patterned  after  the  uniform Certifica \ntion of Law  Act,  12  U.L.A.  52  (1975),  which  has  been  adopted  by \nstatute or  court rule  in  twenty-four  states.  The  need  for  it \nwas  suggested  by  the  Legislative Committee  of Division IV of \nthe D.C.  Bar  as  the  result of inquiries from  the u.s.  Court of \nAppeals  for  the D.C.  Circuit.  It would  permit  the u.s.  Court \nof Appeals,  any other u.s.  Court of Appeals,  the U.S.  Supreme \nCOllrt,  and  the  highest court of any state  to  certify questions \nof District of Columbia law to  the D.C.  Court of Appeals which \nwould  have discretion to act on  the certification.  Adoption of \nthis proposal  by  the  Congress  would  provide  a  means  for \nobtaining  authoritative resolution of undecided  questions of \n\n202 \nD.C.  law that may  be determinative of proceedings pending  in \nthe certifying court.  Information supplied by  the National \nCenter  for State courts and  the Corporation Counsel's office \nindic<.'tes  that this provision would  not be  used  often and  would \nnot burden  the District of Columbia  Court of Appeals.  That \nCourt agrees and  has no  objection to  the  proposal. \nsections 11, 12 and  13 \nThese  three sections represent a  consensus on  the \nproper  balance between  the  public  right  to  participate in  the \njudicial selection process and  the  need  for  confidentiality so \nthe Judicial Nomination Commission can  get  the  best and  most \nadequate  information  to do  its job,  We  realize  that some  parts \nof these proposals might be  adopted  by  the Council  for  the Dis \ntrict of Columbia.  However,  as explained  in  the  memorandum  I \nhave submitted,  there  is doubt  that the Council  could do  all \nthat is needed,  so Congressional  action  is proposed, \nWhile we  are pleased  that 10  of our 12 proposals are \nincluded  in H.R.  3370,  we  are disappointed  that two  are not. \nWe  urge  the  Committee  to  include  them  also.  They are  Items 2 \nand  9 of  the memorandum  I  have  submitted. \nItem 2 would give  the Judicial Nomination Commission \n60,  instead of 30,  days  to process nominations.  This Committee \n\n203 \nrec?gnized  the  need  for  this additional  time when  it allowed  60 \ndays  for  nominating  the  seven additional  judges.  This  should \nbe made  permanent as  recommended  by the  Horsky study.  It is \nsupported  by  the Nomination Commission,  the Courts,  and  our  Bar \nCommittee.  It would  also parallel  the  60  days  allowed  the Ten-\nure Commission  by Section 15  of the bill. \nItem 9  would  give  the Council  of the District of \nColumbia  authority periodically to adjust  th~ jurisdictional \nceiling for  small  claims.  This would give desirable \nflexibility,  would  relieve Congress  of  the  need  to  legislate on \nan  essentially local matter,  and  is in line with how  t~ ~  matter \nis handled  in neighboring  jurisdictions. \nMr.  Chairman,  this completes my  formal  statement.  I \nwill be  glad  to  answer  any questions  the  Committee may  have. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  Thank you.  Both you,  Mr.  Pickering  and  Mr. \nHorsky, I have a couple questions. You did not comment on sec \ntions 2, 5, and 7 of the bill. Is there any reason for that? \nMr. HORSKY. Mr. Chairman, the reason I did not is that I appear \nhere as a representative of the Council for Court Excellence, which \nhas a rather elaborate procedure for coming to conclusions on legis \nlative matters. We have not considered the matters in the items \ncovered by those sections, so I am not in a position to comment on \nthem. \nMr. DYMALLY. Do you have any personal view? \nMr. HORSKY.  I have not studied them in detail, Mr. Chairman. \nSection 2 it seems to me is an appropriate thing to do. It seems to \nme realistic to say that if you commit an offense against the Dis \ntrict of Columbia law you ought to be prosecuted in the name of \nthe District of Columbia. \nThe other one you mentioned was 5- \nMr. DYMALLY. And 7. \nMr. HORSKY. Seven? I don't have any position on that personally \n- ~ \nat all. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Pickering? \nMr.  PICKERING.  If I may,  Mr.  Chairman, like Mr. Horsky,  the \nDistrict of Columbia Bar has strict policies as to how positions can \nbe developed and,  consequently,  I  am limit.ed by what we  have \nstudied in our particular committee. We have not studied, nor did \nthe informal group which developed a lot of these, did they focus \non those three matters. \n\n204 \nSpeaking personally, I have no problem at all with I think the \nintent and the general provisions of section ?'. I think it is realistic, \nand I think that some interchange between the corporation coun \nsel's office and the U.S.  attorney's office beyond the interchange \nthat already exists is probably fl good thing. So from my own stand \npoint, I see no problem with that. I can understand why it is just a \nquestion of part or not of all, but I think it may be a good begin \nning. \nSection 5 of the bill, it is my und.erstanding-and this again is \nsomething we have not studied, so I can't take any official position \non it. But I understand the sugger.::.tion emanated with the board of \nprofessional responsibility to give them some flexibility involving \ncrimes of moral turpitude, and I think that it may be something \nthat requires more study. I think that there was not perhaps the \nintention to repeal all of the section, but maybe only the first sec \ntion. But I  think that needs to be looked at again. I don't know \nenough about it to really comment all that intelligently. \nSection '7, again I have not studied and I can only say that I can \nunderstand the desire because so  much of the Public Defender's \nwork is in the local courts; yet, it does seem to me that there is \nstill, as I  understand it, some work in the court of apPeals. And \nperhaps the chairmanship might be changed, but I am not so sure \nthat the Federal judiciary should be shut completely out of it. That \nis just a personal, off-the-cuff sort of reaction. \nMr. DYMALLY. Do you have any personal reaction to H.R. 2050? \nMr. PICKERING. That is wholly beyOlid any experience that I have \nin the way in which the parole system operates. I  have been,  I \nguess,  involved in a  parole matter or two,  years ago,  and I just \nreally have no thoughts one way or another. I  am not familiar \nenough with the system. I listened to the testimony this morning \nand certainly I think there are some real problems that need to be \nworked out. But the way in which District of Columbia prisoners \nbasically are dispersed all over the country, personally, that is not \na happy situation. \nMr. DYMALLY. But as a lawyer, you see some obvious difficulties \nwith people who are awaiting indictment, getting counsel close to \nthem in this dispersement that takes them all over the country? \nMr. PICKERING. I am sorry I didn't hear, Mr. Chairman. \nMr. DYMALLY.  As a  lawyer, you obviously have some difficulty \nwith--\nMr. HORSKY. I understand, however, that is being changed. \nMr. DYMALLY. Yes. \nMr. HO~SKY. Before conviction they now are housed in the Dis \ntrict of Columbia, which will take care of that problem. \nMr. PICKERING. Yes, I know. I certainly made enough trips as an \nappointed counsel to both the D.C. jail and to Lorton to know the \nproblems that are involved if you had to do much more. I remem \nber years ago when I was on the committee chaired first by now \nJudge Gesell and then by the late Newell Ellison, the C9mmittee \non the Administration of Justice, we found one of the real bottle \nnecks in the whole criminal justice system was the absence of suffi \ncient buses to bring the prisoners up even from Lorton. It is a real \nproblem. \n\n205 \nMr. DYMALLY. This thing is compounded by the fact that under \ncourt order they must move some of the inmates to  Petersburg, \nand now Alderson, before trial. \nOne tmal question for both of you. Do you care to comment on \nthe high rate of incarceration and recidivism in the District of Co \nlumbia? What are your personal views on this? \nMr. PICKERING.  I  am really speaking for  myself.  I  don't know \nwhat the answer is. I heard Mr. Ridley and I have no basis for dis \nagreeing with that. I do think we have both a very efficient police \nforce here beyond what occurs in many other jurisdictions. It still \ncould be improved, the quality of representation, and on the de \nfense side, the Public Defender Service, being able to handle only \nroughly I think 15 percent of the prosecutions in the District. \nBut whether it is something peculiar to the District or simply the \neffectiveness of the law enforcement, I really can't say. I would be \ninclined to believe the effectiveness of law enforcement has a great \ndeal to do with it. \nMr. HORSKY. One of the items, Mr. Chairman, that we noticed in \nthe study made by the D.C. Bar was the very high rate of incarcer \nation of juveniles, and I think this is a matter for attention by the \nD.C. Council. But I think one of the things that we may deal with \nin the futUre in our Council for Court Excellence is some suggested \nmodifications of the way juveniles are treated. \nAs to the recidivism rate, I really have nothing to add to what \nMr. Pickering has said. I don't think that the District is peculiar in \nany sense except that it does have I think a very good police de \npartment. \nMr. DYMALLY. We would be interested in your study on juveniles. \nI think that might be an appropriate subject for a committee hear \ning, so we would like to hear from you as soon as you are finished. \nMr. HORSKY. You might look at the section in the report printed \nin the Senate document, which will give you some idea of what we \nare talking about. \nMr, PICKERING.  This is one of the things, Mr.  Chairman, this \ngroup that we informally brought together from time to time, we \nconcentrated first on looking at what we thought would be a con \nsensus on congressional legislation that would be something that \ncould be a first step in helping improve the judicial process. We \nhave hopes that we can follow the same kind of practice of getting \ntogether occasionally and exchanging ideas about things which the \nDistrict of Columbia Council can deal with, particularly in the ju \nvenile area. It is one of the things that we want to think about \nmoving on. \nThere are many, many recommendations in the Horsky study on \nthat, some of which can be controversial and some of which prob \nably command a broad consensus. But they all need to be looked at \nto see if there is something that could be done about them. \nMr.  DYMALLY.  I  think this  whole  question  of juvenile justice \nwould be an appropriate subject for oversight hearings at some sub \nsequent date. \nMr. HORSKY. We would be glad to participate. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you very much. \n\n2.06 \nThe record will be held open for  approximately 5 days in the \nevent any witness wishes to place any testimony or statement into \nthe record. \nWithout any more business, the meeting is adjourned.. \n[Whereupon, at 10:35 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned, to \nreconvene subject to the call of the Chair.] \n[The following correspondence was received by the subcommit \ntee:] \n\n207 \nCOUNCIL OF THt DlSTRlCI' OF COLUr.mJA \nWASHINGTON, D.

Furthermore,  we  believe that \nCongress should not undertake piecemeal revisions of the .D.C. \ncorrections  programs until completion of a  thorough and  COIQ \nprehenaive review of all sentencing and  correctional practices. \nAt  present under the D.C.  Code,  the determination of parole \njurisdiction is controlled by  the place of incarceration rather \nthan  the jurisdiction of conviction.  The result is that the D.C. \nBoal'd of Parole makes  parole decisions for D. C.  Code  offenders \nwhen  they are housed in I).C.  institut10ns and the United States \nParole Commiss10n makes  parole decisions for D.C.  Code  offenders \nwhen  they are housed in federal institutions.  At  the present time \nover 1,400 D.C.  Code  offenders are held in Federal Bureau of Pri \nsons facilities.  This  represents the designed capacity of three \nmodern correctional institutions.  Although some  of these are in \nfederal custody because of their extremely violent criminal his \ntories or to separate them from other District of Columbia in \nmates,  the bulk of them are in federal custody primarily because \nof shortages of space to house inmates in the District of Colum.bia \nsystem.  ThuB,  two factors not addressed in H.R.  2050 are the real \nburden to the Federal Bureau of Prisons of confining this large \ngroup of local offenders and the serious problems involved in \nadding these geographically dispersed i~~ates to the D.C.  Parole \nBoard's caseload. \n\n209 \nHonorable Ronald  Dellutns \nR.R.  2050 - Page 2 \nIn the 1930's when  the D.C.  Board of Parole was  established, \nthis divided jurisdictional scheme may have met correctional \nneeds.  The  Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1983 abolishes the \nUnited States Parole Commission in 1991, however,  and legislative \nattention must clearly be  given to the questions of futUre  parole \nresponsibility for D.C.  Code offenders designated to Federal in \nstitutions.  At  the same time every effort must be made  to insure \nthat the District of Columbia will provide adequate prison space \nto house its sentenced criminals. \nA larger question is what  role should parole serve as a  cor \nrectional tool in the District of Columbia?  The  legislative his \ntory of the Comprehenaive Crime Control Act of 1984,  P.L.  98-473, \nclearly reflects the Congressional determination that the \"rehab \nilitation model\"  upon which the Federal sentencing and parole sys~ \ntern was  based is no longer valid.  S. Rep.  No.  225,  98th Congress \n1st Sess.  38  (1983).  Based upon  a  study spanning a decade con \nducted by  the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal \nLaw,  it was  concluded that the Federal sentencing and parole sys \ntem  resulted in significant disparities in criminal sentences.  As \nstated in the Senate Report: \nThe  shameful disparity in criminal sentences ia a major \nflaw in the existing criminal justice system,  and mskes  it \nclear that the system is ripe for reform.  Correcting our \narbitrary and  capricious method of sentencing will not be a \npanacea for all of the problems which confront the adminis \ntration of cl'iminal justice, but it will constitute a  sig \nnificant step forward. \nThe  [Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  (CCCA)] \nmeets  the critical challenges of sentencing reform.  The \n[CeCA IS) sweeping provisions are dp.signed to structure \njudicial sentencing discretion,  eliminate indeterminate \nsentenCing, phase out parole release, and make  criminal \nsentenCing fairer and more  certain.  The  current effort \nconstitutes an important attempt to reform the manner in \nwhich we  sentence convicted offenders.  The  Committee \nbelieves that the [CCCA)  represents a major breakthrough in \nthis area.  Id.  at 65. \nThe  current D.C.  sentencing and parole system does not reflect \nthis new  understanding of' the limitations of the  \"rehabilitation \nmodel\"  as described above. \n\n210 \nHonorable Ronald Dellums \nH.R.  2050  - Page 3 \nIn addition,  the District of Columbia parole system has other \ndemonstrated problems.  When we  reviewed similar legislation two \nyears ago [H.R.  3369],  thill matter was  discussed 1n detail in our \nletter dated July 25,  1983 from  Assistant Attorney qeneral Robert \nA.  McConnell to you.  The Department noted at that time that the \nD.C.  Board of Parole, according to its 1982 annual report,  gr~nted \nparole at initial heal'ings  to 61%  of the adult offenders and that \n73%  of the remainder were granted parole upon a  rehearing.  The \nBoard also reported however,  that based upon  a  study of a selected \nsample of 322 parolees released on parole between 1977 and 1979, \n52% were re-arrested during the first two  years of parole super \nvision.  Of  the parolees who  were  re-arrested,  77%  were convicted \nfor crimes committed while on  parole.  Given the very high per \ncentage of parolees released at the time of initial parole con \nsideration and the very high rate of recidivist criminal activity \namong  those released,  the policies and procedures of the D.C. \nBoard of Parole were  called into serious question. \nWe  also painted out that despite the large number of D.C. \nparolees who  commit  crimes following parole release, parole appar \nently was  revoked in a  relatively small percentage of the cases. \nIn that regard,  the D.C.  Board of Parole reported that of those \nparolees in its 1977-1979 sample who were convicted of crimes \nw~ileon parole,  parole was  revoked because of the new offense in \nless than one half of the cases.  Although the reason for this \nstatistic was  not explained,  it appears that it may  be attributed \nto the D.C.  Parole Board policy of not ~ssuing parole violator \nwarrants for certain offenses.  In thi~ regard,  the Board listed \nin its 1982 Annual  Report the types of oi'fenees it terms \"Eligible \nOffenses\" for purposes of issuance of parole Violator warrants. \nIt appears that as a matter of pollcy. the Board will not issue \nparole violator warrants for burglary of commercial establish \nments,  {:06session of firearms  (unless the defendant is arrestea \nwith the weapon 1n his hand or on his person),  grand larceny, \nembe~zlement, fraud,  forgery and utter:Lng ana for a  host of other \nviolat~ona of the District of Columbia Coae  or the United states \nCode. \nThis apparent policy which allows substantial numbers of \nparolees to continue on parole even after arrest and  conViction of \nserious crimes was  of significant concern to us  in the past.  If \nthese matters have not yet been completely remedied,  and it may  be \ntoo early to conclude that they have,  then similar concern is \npresently warranted.  Under H.R.  2050,  the Jurisdiction of the \nD• . 'C.  Boara of Parole would be substantially expanded  to include \nthose D.C.  Code offendel's presently under the jurisdiction of the \nU.S.  Parole Commission.  These offenders, however,  include some of \n\n211 \nHonorable ROnald Dellums \nH.R.  2050 - Page ~ \nthe most dangerous and Violent criminals convicted in the District \nof Columbia.  Premature release of such individuals pursuant to \nexisting parole policies would pose a  real and direct threat to \nlaw enforcement interests in the District of Columbia. \nWe  believe it is tlme for a  thorough legislative review of \nDistrict of Columbia sentencing and correctional practices.  A \nmajor expansion of the oapacity of D.C.  correotional facilities is \nessential.  The  Federal Bureau of Prisons is seriously overcrowded \nand can no longer accept the overload of the Distriot of Columbia \nsystem.  This  is especially true in light of the increased D.C. \nprison population that would result, at least temporarily,  from a \nmore  responsibly run parole system.  Replacement of the parole \nsystem in the District of CO~'lmbia by a  sentencing guideline \nsystem similar to that adopted by Congress in the Comprehensive \nCrime Control Act of 198~ should be considered.  While expansion \nof the D.C.  inmate capacity must begin at once,  other changes can \nbe more  tho['oughly considered than is done in H.R.  2050. \nThe  Office of Management  and Budget has advised this \nDepartment that there 1s no  objection to the submission of this \nreport from  the standpoint of the Administration's program. \nAt.: \nSincerely, \n,.3(, \npj' \n'  ~~ '/ '(jt d'e: \n~\nPhi lip D.  rady \nc  ing Assistant Attorney General \n\nH.R. 2050 AND  H.R. 3370 \nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER IG, 1985 \nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, \nSUBCOMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND EDUCATION, \nCOMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OF COLU:MBIA, \nWashington, DC. \nThe subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:27  a.m., in room \n1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Mervyn M. Dymally \n(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. \nPresent: Representatives Dymally and Combest. \nAlso present: Donald M.  Temple, senior staff counsel; Donn G. \nDavis, senior legislative associate; Sandra Fiske, staff assistant; and \nRonald P. Hamm, minority staff assistant. \nMr. DYMALLY. The Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education is \ncalled to order to consider two bills, H.R. 2050 and H.R. 3370. \nThus far this session the subcommittee has favorably reported to \nthe full committee H.R. 2717, a bill to establish a separate and in \ndependent jury system for the District of Columbia. Similar to H.R. \n2717, the bills before us this morning address both home rule con \ncerns  and  the  improvement  and  efficiency  of the local judicial \nsystem. \nH.R. 2050 is a reintroduction of H.R. 3369, a bill introduced and \npassed by the House of Representatives in the 98th Congress. It \nwould transfer parole over District of Columbia Code offenders in \nFederal prisons from the U.S. Parole Commission to the District of \nColumbia Parole Board. \nThere are over 1,700 District of Columbia Code offenders housed \nin the Federal Bureau of Prison facilities. Male District of Colum \nbia Code offenders are placed in Federal facilities for selective cus \ntody and various other reasons.  Female District of Columbia of \nfenders sentenced to greater than I-year terms are placed in Feder \nal facilities due to the absence of a facility specifically for female \noffenders in the District of Columbia. Most of these female offend \ners are confined at Alderson, WV, over 300 miles from the District \nof Columbia. \nUnder present law, at section 21-209 of the District of Columbia \nCode, the place of an offender's confmement determines parole au \nthority. This law is contrary to the current Federal-State parole \npractices. \nAccording to the U.S. Parole Commission, the District of Colum \nbia is the only government housing inmates in Federal correction \ninstitutions which does not retain parole authority. Several Federal \nlawsuits by both male and female District of Columbia Code offend \ners in Federal prisons have been filed as a result of these practices. \n(213) \n\n214 \nAs we consider this bill, several points are worth noting. Since \nthe House passed this bill in the last Congress, the District of Co \nlumbia has revised its parole guidelines consistent with certain rec \nommendations made by Senator Specter and the U.S. attorney for \nthe District of C01umbia. Also, the prison overcrowding problem in \nthe District of Columbia has resulted in an increased number of \nDistrict of Columbia inmates being transferred to Federal prisons. \nFurther, Congress recently passed the Comprehensive Crime Con \ntrol Act of 1983 which would abolish Federal parole and the U.S. \nParole Commission in 1991. \nMost important, section 24-209 became law almost 50 years ago \nand 40  years prior to the Home Rule Act. It's language remains \nambiguous. For example, neither this provisior.., nor its legislative \nhistory, answers whether the U.S. Parole Commission should apply \nDistrict of Columbia parole standards in its parole consideration of \nDistrict of Columbia Code offenders. Given this history, appropriate \namendment would seem long overdue. \nLawsuits fIled in response to this provision remain unsolved and \ncontinue to consume time and expense. This legislation provides a \npractical and legally sound remedy to this longstanding problem. \nH.R. 3370, the Prosecutorial and Judicial Efficiency Act of 1985, \nis a bill which evolves in large part from recommendations of the \nDistrict of Columbia Court Study Committee under the chairman \nship of Mr. Charles Horsky, the District of Columbia courts, and \nprivate counseL This bill seeks to clarify that District of Columbia \nCode matters do not arise under the laws of the United States, and \nDistrict of Columbia Code offenders are crimes against the District \nof Columbia and not against the United States. \nBefore we adjourn, I want to welcome a new member, Mr. Com \nbest, to the committee. Welcome, Mr. Combest. \nMr. COMBEST. Thank you, sir. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Now, what we propose to do is to recess until the \nfirst rollcall. During the I5-minute break in the rollcall, we will as \nsemble in the Rayburn Room just behind the House Chambers and \nproceed to conduct the business of the subcommittee. So  the sub \ncommittee is now in recess. \n[Whereupon, at 9:34 a.m., the subcommittee was recessed.] \n[Report 98-909 follows:] \n\n215 \n98TH CON,GRESS}  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  {  REPORT \n£dSe88wn  98-V09 \nD.C. JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY ACT \nJULY 25, 1984.-Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State \nof the Union and ordered to be printed \nMr. DELLUMs, from the Committee on the District of Columbia, \nsubmitted the following \nREPORT \n[To accompany R.R. 5951J \n[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget OfficeJ \nThe Committee on the District of Columbia. to whom was referred \nthe bill (H.R. 5951) to change the appointment process for judges of \nDistrict of Columbia courts, and for other purposes. having considered.· \nthe same, report favorably thereon with an amendment and recommend \nthat the bill as amended do pass. \nThe amendment strikes out all after the enacting clause of the bill \nand inserts a new text which appears in italic type in the reported bill. \nPURPOSE  OF  THE  BILL \nThe purpose of H.R. 5951 is to transfer judicial appointment author \nity over judges of the Superior Court and Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia from the President tD the District of Columbia \nMayor Il,nd confirmation authority from the United States Senate to \nthe District 0:£  Columbia City Council and to increase the jurisdic \ntionallimit of the Small Claims Court of the District of Columbia. \nBACKGROUND  OF  THE LEGISLATION \nPrior to 1970, the United States District Court was the court of \ngeneral unlimited jurisdiction for the District of Columbia. It func-\n60ned as both a federal and state court, exercising jurisdiction over \nmatters of a purely local nature. Additionally. the District of Colum \nbia had three trial conrts of limited or special jurisdiction; The Court \nof General Sessions. a J uyc'nile Court and a Tax Conrt. \nIn 1970 Congress passed Public Law 91-358, the District of Colum \nbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act. which became effective \nin February, 1971. The act reorganized the District's courts, expanded \ntheir jurisdiction, authorized additional judgeships, established the \n81-0060 \n\n216 \njoint Committee on Judicial Administration and created the Commis \nsion on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure. \nMost important, this Act created a District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals, the highest court in the District, equivalent to the court of \nlast resort in anv state. Likewise, final judgments of this court became \nreviewable by the United States Supreme Court. This Act also abol \nished the Court of General Sessions, the Juvenile Court and the Tax \nCourt !lnd c.re.a~ed the .D.istric~ o~ Columb~a Superior Court with the \nfollowmg divIsIOns: CIVIl, Crlmmal, FamIly, Probate, and Tax. The\\ \nLandlord and Tenant and the Small Claims and Conciliation Courts \nfUllction as branches of the civil division. Congress expressly estab \nlished the District of Columbia judicial systelllllnalagous to state judi \ncial systems. \nIn December, 1973 Congress passed the District of Columbia Self \nGovernment and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973, Public \nLaw 93-198 (hereafter the Home Rule Act). \nThe House version, H.R. 16196, proposed the same language pro \nvided in H.R. 5951 regarding :Mayoral nomination of judges and City \nCouncil confirmation (See Report 91-907). \nThe Senate version, S. 2601, also provided for Mayoral nomination \nof judges. However, it retained confirmation authority in the Senll:te \n(See Senate Report 91-405) . A House floor amendment retained pres} \ndential appointment authority. At conference presidential appoint \nment of judges and Senate confirmation authority were both retained. \n(See Conference Report 91-1303) \nThe 1973 Self Government and Governmental Reorganization Act \ncreated a Judicial Nomination Commission nuthorized to recommend \nnominations to the President for appointment of judges to District \nof Columbia courts. It established residency and other requirements \nfor judicial nominations and appointments. \nThe Judicial Nomination Commission and the Judicial Disabilities \nand Tenure Oommission  (hereafter, Tenure Commission)  each con \nsists of seven members similarly appointed. One member is appointed \nhy the President; two members by the unified District of Oolumbia \nBar Board of Governors j two members by the Mayor, one of whom \nshall not be a lawyer; one non lawyer member by the Council and oue \nmember appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, who is required to be an active \nor retired Federal judge serving in the District. \nThe J udicinl Nomination Commission submits names of three can \ndidates to the President thirty days before a judicial vacancy occurs. \nTf more than one. vacancy occurs, the Commission must submit sepa \nrate.lists of candidates for each vacancy. Once the President declares \nhis nomination the. Senate must. confirm it. If the President fails to \nnominate a candidate within sixty days after receiving a list of names, \nthe Commission may appoint a candidate from the list with the advice \nund consent of the Senate. \nA person must be It United States citizen and a Distt·~ct. of Columbia \nresident to receive a judicial appointment in a District of Col11mbia \ncourt. Additionally, he or she must have bee,n an active member of \nthe District of Columbia Bar and engaged in the active practice of \n\n217 \n3 \nlaw in the District for five years preceding the nomination, or for \nfive years must have served on the faculty of a law school in the Dis \ntrict or have been employed as an attorney by the Unit.ed States or \nDistrict of Columbia government. \nJudges of District of Columbia Courts are appointed for fifteen \nyear terms. Upon completion of their terms, judges continue to serve \nuntil reappointed or a successor is appointed. A judge's term is auto \nmatically extended for another full term if the Tenure Commission \ndetermines the candidate to be \"exceptionally well qualified\" or \"well \nqualified\" for reappointment. If the Tenure Commission determines \nthe candidate to ue simply \"qualified\" for reappointment, the Presi \ndent may nominate such candIdate and refer the nomination for ,sen \nate confirmation. If the Tenure COlllmission determines the candidate \nto be \"unqualIfied\" for reappointment, a judge becomes ineligible for \nreappointment. \nIn the District of Columbia Superior Court there is presently \nauthorized one chief judge and fifty associate judges. In the District \nof Columbia Court of Appeals there is one chief and eight associate \njudges. The Judicial N:omination Commission designates a chief judge \nfor both courts. \nThe jurisdiction of these respective courts is purely local in nature. \nThe Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from all final \norders, judgements and interlocutory orders of the District of Colum \nbia Superior Court and all orders and decisions of the Mayor, the \nCity Council or any agency of the District GI Columbia. The Superior \nCourt has jurisdiction over any civil action or other matter brought \nin the District of Columbia unless exclusive jurisdiction is vested in \na Federal court in the District of Columbia. It also has jurisdiction \nover any violation of criminal laws applicable exclusively to the Dis \ntrict of Columbia. \nOn January 2, 1979 pursuant to section 602(a) (9) of the District \nof  Columbia  Self-Government and  Reorganization  Act,  Congress \ntransferred to the local government the authority to amend and re \npeal provisions of the District of Columbia Criminal Code. Thus, \nthe District not only maintains its own civil and criminal laws, it is \nalso vested with authority to amend those laws. Pursuant to section \n602(c) (1)  and (2)  of the Home Rule Act, the council chairman is \nrequired to transmit such District of Columbia government acts to the \nCongress for a thirty day review period before such acts can become \nlaw. During this period, any sinj!le member of Congress may introduce \na. disapproval resolution which, if passed by both Houses of Congress, \nresults in a legislative veto of the locally passed legislation. \nIn August, 1980 Representative Dellums, Chairman of the House· \nCommittee on the District. of Columbia, introduced H.R. 7988 the \nCriminal .rustice Reform bill. This bill sought to establish 11. District \nof Columbia Attorney General. transfer prosecutorial  authorit.y to \ntht' local Attorn('y Genl'm} for locaJ offens('s and provine for local ap \npointment of judges. The bilI was referred to the Subcommittee on \n.Tudicinry, Education Ilnd Manpower, then chaired by Representative \nMazzoli. \n\n218 \n4 \nOn September 23, lD80, the Subcommittee held a hearing on this \nproposal and received extensive testimony. The Subcommittee took \nno action. \nIn May, 1984 J{epresentn.tives Bliley, Fauntroy, Dymally and Mc \nKinney introduced H.R. 5636, a bill to chn.nge the appointment process \nfor judges of the District of Columbia and to increase the jurisdic \ntiona1  limit of the Small Claims Court from $750 to $2,000. \n~  On June 14, 1984 the Committee on the District of Columbin., Sub-\ncommittee on Judiciary and Education held hearings 011 H.lt 5636 \nand received  statements from  the following  witnesses: Joseph  di \nGenova, United States Attorney for the District of Col umbia; Pauline \nSchneider, on behalf of Mayor Marion Barry; David Clarke, District \nof Columbia City Council Chn.irmanj Chief Judge Theodore R. New \nman, Jr., Chairinan, Joint Committee on ,Iudicial Administration; \nSamuel Harahan, Executive Director, Council for Court Excellence; \nEllen Bass, Co-chair of District IV, District of Columbia Bar; and \nI yerson Mitchell. III, President of the ,Yashington Bar Association. \nAll witnesses indicated support for increasing tIl(';  jurisdictional \nlimit of the Small Claims Court of the District of Columbia from \n$750 to $2,000. \nThe Mayor,  City  Council  Chairman  and  the President  of  the \n\\'{a shington Bar Association supported the complete bill. \nThe United States Attorney for the District of Columbia opposed \ntransfer of judicial nomination and confirmation authority to  the \nMavor and the City Council. The Council for Court Excellence and \nDivision IV of the District of Columbia Bar t()ok no position. Follow \ning' the hearing~ the subcommittee passed the bill by voice vote and \nreferred it to the iun committee. The full committee passed H.R. 5630 \nby It unanimous  voice  vote  with seven  members present and four \nproxies in support of the bill. \nox \nNEED FOR LEGISLATIOX  .TUDICIAL ApPOINT1orEXT AUTHORITY \nSince 1970 Congress I111S passed legislation on it cnre~lll bnt consistent \nbasis to transfer full self-f!Overnment over local affaIrs from the fed \neral rrovernment to the District of Columbia government. \nThis bill hi a step in the same direction. H:R. 5951 seeks to gTant the \nDistrict of Columbia the snme autonomy over selection of judges in \nits court svstem that states have over RpJection of judg'es in state court \nsystems. The proposal to tram;fer judicial appointment authority to \nthe local government is It timely and lodcal proposal, consistent with \nthe nation's deep rooted democratic tradition. \nIn this connp<'t-ion. :;'Ifr. Dvmnllv. Chairman of the Subcommittee on \n,Tuc1icinry and Education. stated:' \n... \nThe District has a local n£'l11ocl'ati(' p'oYrrnmrnt which in \ncludes th(' EX(,ClltjyP, L('gisllltin' ani! ,Tnrli('illl hranc]1Ps and \nits structure mirrors f<>neral fmo most stat(' and lOCAl politi{'al \nenterprises.  ...

I s('(! no thl'l'ut to the inde \npendence 01' quality of the Judiciary. \n\n219 \n5 \nMr.  Bliley, the ranking minority member on  the Subcommittee \nstated: \n... we have had 19 years of Home Rule and I  think it is \nreasonable for the citlzens who pay taxes and who elect the \nMayor to have some imput into the appointment of judges. \n*  *  *  * \n~ \n... I  think that if we really truly believe in Home Rule, \nthat having the Mayor do the appointment is only fair. \nIn Septembcr. 1980 Chief Judge Theodore NewllJan of the District \nof Columbia Court of Appeals testified on the transfer of judicial \nappointment  authority.  His  statement summarized  this  bill  quite \nadequately: \nJudg~s will be doing the same work they are doing now. \nThev wIll have the same term of office they have now. They \nwill' have the same jurisdiction. They win have the same \npower. The only difference is their commission of office will be \nsigned by the Mayor, rather than by the President of the \nUnited States. \nThis bill seeks to recognize t1le rights of District of Colum \nbia citizens and to make the selection of local judges consistent \nwith the selection of federal and state court judges. \nSMALL CLAIMS JURISDICTIONAL LUIIT \nIn the 1970 District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Proce \ndure Act, the small claims jurisdictional limit was increased from $150 \nto $750. There has been no increase in this jurisdictional limit in four-\nteen years.  . \nPresently, there is a backlog in the number of cases pending in the \ncivil division of the District of Columbia Superior Court. On this \nissue, District of Columbia Court Study Committee of the District of \nColumbia Bar concluded that small clalffis cases are actually clogging \nthe civil division with a significant impact on the motions calendar. \nStatistics prepared for the clerk of the civil division of the District of \nColumbia Superior Court in 1983 show that, based on a sample of 990 \ncivil division cases, 51 percent involved claims up to $2,500. \nIt is clear that a  shift of smaller claims to the small claims branch \nwould greatly aid the Superior Court in calendaring and disposing \nof pending civil cases. Further, an increased jurisdictional limit would \nprovide parties a less expensive and speedier forum for resolution of \nlueir complaints. \nOnly one judge has handled small claims cases from 1970 to date. \nHence,  the Committee recognizes  that the increased  jurisdictional \nlimit. willlikelv result in an increased small claims calendar and work \nload. The Committee is concerned that the Court adequately prepare \nfor the transition of cases to the small claims court in order to con \ntinue its efficient and timely disposition of cases. \nAdditionally, the Committee is concerned that the court provide \nmaximum access with minimum inconvenience to parties in the small \nclaims court, pa.rticularly consumers who are subject to risk of job \nor pay loss. Thus, the court may consider it practical to expand its \n56-728 0 - 86 - 8 \n\n220 \n6 \nevening sessions and to adopt a half day scheduling system. Evening \nsessions tend to minimize ooth business and consumer risk of loss. \nMoreover, the ncar certainty of schedule is beneficial to both the court \nand the parties.  • \nFinally, the Committee is concerned that the small claims court \ninsure the changes in its jurisdictional limit and schedule are pub \nlicized throughout the District of Columbia. \nSUJ\\rMARY \nThese bills address both Rome Rule concerns and the quality of \nefficiency of the local judicial process. These bills neither create any\" \nnew authority, nor require any additional spending. \nCOMMITl'EE VOTE \nOn June 28, 1984 the Fu1l Committee, with a quorum present, took \nup the measure and passed it by a unanimous voice vote. \nSTATEUI:.'NTS REQUIRED BY RULE Xrr(I) (3) OF ROUSE RULES  . \nOVERSIGHT  FnmINGS AXD RECO~DrExDATIOXS \nThe Committee's oversight findings with respect to the matters with \nwhich the legislation is concerned remain as a part of its continuing \ncongressional oversight required by the Constitution and specifica.lly \nprovided for in the Home Rule Act (sections 601, 602, 604, and 731 \nof Public Law 93-198). \nCOlrMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT 01?ERATIONS SmrMARY \nNo  oversight findings  and  recommendations have  been  received \nwilich  relate to this measure from  the Committee on Government \nOperationsunderc~ause2(b) (2) ofRuleX.  \n. INFLATIONARY IMPACT \n.  1 \nThe bill, if enacted into law, will have no forseeable inflationary \nimpact on prices or costs in the operation of the national econorny. \nBUDGET AUTHORITY \nThis legislation for the District of Columbia creates no new budget \nauthority or tax expenditures by the Federal Government. Therefore, \na statement required by section 308 (a) of the Congressional Budget \nand Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is not necessary.  . \nCONGRESSIONAL BuOOET OFFICE-COST ES'rIMATE \nU.S. CO~(mESS, \nCO~GRESSroNAL BUDGET OFFICE, \nWashington, D.O., JUly 6,1984. \nHon.RoNALD V.

CHAJIUrAx: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed \nR.R. 5951, the District of Columbia Judicial Appointment Authority \n\n221 \n7 \nAct of Hl84, as ordered reportc(l by the House Committee on the Dis \ntrict of Columbia .•1  une 28, 1!J84:. We estimate no significant budget \nimpact to federal, state or local governments would result from enact \nment of this bill. \nR.R. 5951 amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and \nGovernmental Reorganization Act to allow the Mayor of the District \nof Columbia (D.C.), with the advice and consent of the D.C. Council, \nto nominate and appoint judges of the D.C. Courts. Under current law, \nthe lJ,ppointments are made by the President, with the advice and con \nsent of the Senate. The bill also changes the D.C. Judicial Nomination \nCommission  and the D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and \nTenure from seyen-member commissions with some members serving \nterms of different lengths, to five-member eommissions with all mem \nbers serving six-year terms. \nH.R. 5951 also expands the jurisdiction of the Small Claims and \nConciliation Branch of the Superior Court to include any action for \nthe recovery of sums of money not exceeding $2,000. Based on informa \ntion from the Executive Office of the D.C. Courts, we expect that enact \nment of this provision would increase the calendar of the small claims \ncourt, but decrease by a correspondjng amount the calendar of the civil \ncourt. This shift in jurisdiction is not expected to have any signifcant \nbudget impacts to the D.C. government. \nIf .you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to \nprOVIde them. \nSincerely, \nRUDOLPH G. PENNER. \nCnANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, As REPORTED \nIn compliance with clause 3 of Rule XIII of the Rules of the House \nof Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bili, as re \nported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omitted is \nenclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italic, existing law \nin which no change is proposed is shown in roman) : \nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SELF-GOVERNMENT \nAND GOVERNMENTAL REORGANIZATION ACT \n'\"  '\"  '\"  '\"  *  '\"  '\" \nTITLE IV-THE DISTRICT CHARTER \nI/<  *  '\"  *  '\"  '\" \nPART C-THE JUDICIARY \nJUDICIAL POWERS \nSEC. 431.

Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. There is a cer \ntain amount of heroism in anybody that wants to join us here in \nour happy family,  and we have been understaff on the minority \nside, and I am delighted to be finally staffed again, so to speak. \nThe CHAIRMAN. I thank my colleague for his remarks. \nThe gentleman from California. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Mr.  Chairman, the gentleman from Texas I be \nlieve attended his first meeting last week, and we would extend to \nhim a very warm welcome and look forward to working with him. \nThe CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. \nThe purpose of today's full  committee  meeting is to mark up \nthree pieces of legislation which affect; the city's authority over the \nparole  of D.C.  codefenders  and  matters  related  to  the judicial \nsystem. \nWe are marking up bill H.R. 2050 on the parole board; H.R. 3578, \na clean bilI for the bill H.R. 3370 on court procedures. These bills \nwere considered thoroughly at subcommittee hearings on October 1 \nand under our committee rule 0.3, on the recommendation of the \nsubcommittee chairperson the majority members have agreed to \nconsider these bills in full committee.  . \nIn addition, we have before us bill H.R. 2946, a clean bill for H.R. \n2717, the jury system bill reported out by our Subcommittee on Ju \ndiciary and Education last June. \nThese bills have as their chief concern areas wl.ere the Federal \ninterest is either nonexistent or virtually nonexistent. \nIn no other jurisdiction does the Federal Government play any \ndirect role in these matters, and it is only logical and appropriate \nthat the District of Columbia should also be preeminent in these \nstrictly local matters. \nThe three bills before us would achieve this end. \nI call on the subcommittee chairman, Hon. Mervyn Dymally, for \na motion to report to the House H.R. 2050,  H.R.  3578,  and H.R. \n2946, with such explanation as he may give so we can vote on these \nmatters en bloc. \nMr. McKINNEY. If the chairman would yield. \nThe  CHAIRMAN.  I  would  yield  momentarily to  the gentleman \nfrom Connecticut. \nMr. McKINNEY. I have a letter to the chairman from the Honora \nble Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., saying: \nI am unavoidablY absent both from any markup on Tuesday, October 26, 1985 and \nwish to formally state my intention to file additional views on any or all measures \napproved by the committee on Tuesday, October 22, including H.R. 2050, H.R. 2946 \nand H.n. :m7B. and shall be 1'.3 prompt in submitting these views as possible. Thank \ning you in advance. \n\n264 \nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's communication to the full com \nmittee is duly noted,  and the committee would take appropriate \naction. \nThe gentleman from California is recognized. \nMr. DYMALLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this meeting \nof the full committee to consider the bills before us. \nI  would like, Mr. Chairman, to explain each bill before moving \nfor their approval. \nFirst, H.R. 2050 is the same bill introduced and passed by the \nHouse of Representatives in the 98th Congress. It would transfer \nparole over District of Columbia Code offenders in Federal prisons \nfrom the U.S. Parole Commission to the D.C. Parole Board. \nMr. Chairman, I might add parenthetically, it is my intention to \ntake staff up to Alderson, WV this weekend for an oversight visit, \nwith the committee's permission. \nThe CHAIRMAN. Without objection. \nMr. DnfALLY. There are over 1,700 District of Columbia Code of \nfenders housed in Federal Bureau of Prison facilities. Many Dis \ntrict of Columbia Code offenders are placed in Federal facilities for \nselective custody and various other raasons. \nFemale D.C. offenders sentenced to greater than l-year terms are \nroutinely placed in Federal prisons as a matter of course. This is \ndue to  the absence of a  local penal facility for female offenders. \nMost of these female offenders are confIned to Alderson, WV, or \n300 miles from the District of Columbia. Others are confined as far \naway as Texas. \nUnder present law at section 24-209 of the District of Columbia \nCode, the place of an offender's confInement determines parole au \nthority. This law is contrary to current Federal/State parole prac \ntices. \nAccording to the U.S. Parole Commission, the District of Colum \nbia is the only local jurisdiction housing inmates in a Federal cor \nrection institution which does not retain its own parole authority. \nAB a result of this practice, several Federal lawsuits by both male \nand female District of Columbia Code offenders in Federal prisons \nhave been fIled. \nSeveral points are worth noting. \nFirst, since the House passed this bill in the last Congress the \nDistrict of Columbia has revised its parole guidelines  consistent \nwith seven recommendations made by Senator Arlen Specter and \nthe U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. \nSecond, the prison overcrowding problem in the District has re \nsulted in  an increased number of District of Columbia inmates \nbeing transferred to Federal prisons. \nThird, Congress recently passed a Comprehensive Crime Control \nAct of 1983 which would abolish Federal parole and the U.S. Parole \nCommission in 1991. \nFourth, section 24-29 became law almost 50  years ago  and 40 \nyears prior to the Home Rule Act. Lawsuits flied in response to \nthis provision remain  unresolved and continue to  consume  time \nand expense. \nThis legislation provides a practical and logically sound remedy \nto this longstanding problem. \n\n\\ \n265 \nH.R. 3578 the Prosecutorial and Judicial Efficiency Act of 1985, \nt \nis a  clean bill version of H.R.  3370, which evolved in large part \nfrom  recommendations  of the District of Columbia  Court Study \nCommittee under the chairmanship of Mr. Charles Horsky and the \nDistrict of Columbia courts. \nThe subcommittee held a hearing on both H.R.  2050  and H.R. \n3370 on October 3, 1985, and received substantial testimony in sup \nport of these bills, along with constructivl~ comments. \nAs a result, the majority and minorit,} staff worked closel~ under \nthe subcommittee chairman and ranking minority member s direc \ntion to work out any differences in H.R 3370. \nH.R. 3578 represents this bipartisan work product. But there are \nseveral minor technical amendments which have been brought to \nour attention by legislative counsel's office. \nH.R. 2946, a clean bill for H.R. 2717, is a bill to establish an inde \npendent jury system for the Superior Court of the District of Co \nlumbia. \nThe subcommittee held hearings on H.R. 2717 on June 26, 1985, \nand reported a clean bill to the full committee. \nPresently, the local judicial system's jury plan is determined by \nFederal judicial officers. The local court system, like that of other \njurisdictions, is capable of administering its own jury system and \ndetermining its own jury needs and selection processes. \nThese bills have received broad-based support from the Mayor, \nthe city council, the local board of parole, the superior court, the \nU.S. District Court on the jury bill, certain local bar association \nsubdivisions, the Horsky committee, and the Council on Court Ex \ncellence. \nDepartment  of Justice  opposition  has  been expressed  to  H.R. \n2050 and H.R. 2946. \nMr. Chairman, I would like to move that the committee vote on \nthe technical  amendments  to  H.R.  3578  en  bloc  and thereafter, \nmove that the committee favorably report H.R. 2050, H.R. 2946 and \nH.R. 3578 to the House of Representatives for its consideration and \npassage. \nThe CHAIRMAN.  All right. Is there any discussion? The gentle \nman from the District of Columbia. \nMr. FAUmROY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer my full sup \nport for the three bills brought forth by the Subcommittee on Judi \nciary and Education. \nH.R.  2050,  as the chairman has indicated, transfers parole au \nthority over the District of Columbia offenders housed in Federal \nprisons from the U.S. Parole Commission to the District of Colum \nbia Parole Board. \nH.R.2946 establishes an independent jury system for the Superi \nor Court of the District of Columbia. This legislation, requested by \nthe D C. Superior Court and concerned groups, will provide for an \nefficient jury system for the District Superior Court. This change \nwill make jury duty for District of Columbia citizens a more worth \nwhile civic duty. \nH.R.  3578  will require criminal prosecutions  concerning viola \ntions of the laws of the District of Columbia to be conducted in the \nname of the District. The bill further provides permanent author \nity for hearing commissioners in the District and modifies certain \n\n266 \nprocedures of the D.C.  Judicial Nomination Commission and the \nD.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure. \nMr. Chairman, all of this legislation continues the committee's \nefforts to extend and enhance the concept of self-government for \nthe District of Columbia. \nI wish to commend the Subcommittee on Judiciary and Educa \ntion under the chairmanship of Mr. Dymally and the ranking mi \nnority member, Mr. Bliley, for this significant legislation. \nThe CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. \nIs there any further discussion? \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that all \nthe technical amendments to these bills be approved. \nThe CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it is so ordered.  . \nThe Chair would indicate that we are waiting for one of our dis \ntinguished colleagues to arrive, and at that point it is the intention \nof the Chair that the clerk will call the role on the motion offered \nby the gentleman from California, the chairman of the subcommit \ntee, that we pass these three bills en bloc. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Chairman. \nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California. \nMr.  DYMALLY,  Because  the H.R.  3578  has  so  many technical \namendments,  I  want to  make specific  mention  of H.R.  3578,  a \nnumber of technical amendments. \nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman is clarifying his unanimous con \nsent request? \nMr. DYMALLY. Yes. \nThe CHAIRMAN. With that clarification and without objection, the \nmotion is agreed to and the amendments will be placed at the ap \npropriate point in the record. \nMr. STARK. Mr. Chairman. \nThe CHAIRMAN.

It is the intention of the Chair that we would \nkeep the roll open until such time as the gentleman from Texas \narrives in order to cast his vote. He is on his way. \nI thank my colleagues for providing us the necessary quorum to \nvote out the three bills. \nWhile we are waiting, the Chair would like to thank the gentle \nman from California and the subcommittee for their diligent work \nand we appreciate their efforts on behalf of enhancing the quality \nof life for the residents of the District of Columbia. The gentleman \nhas been very hard working and extraordinarily diligent in these \nmatters and the Chair just wants that to be duly noted. \nMr. DYMALLY.  Thank you very much, Mr.  Chairman. I want a \ncopy of your remarks to be transmitted to the District newspapers \nin Los Angeles. \nMr. Chairman, while we have some time, I want to again give \nnotice that I intend to visit Alderson, WV this weekend and will \ntake staff with me for a long overdue oversight visit. \nThe CHAIRMAN. We thank the gentleman for his efforts. \nThe gentleman from the District of Columbia. \nMr. F AUNTROY.  May I commend the gentleman, as well, for his \nleadership and commitment to his responsibilities to the District of \nColumbia Committee and thus to the people of the District of Co \nlumbia. \nI wish I could accompany you to Alderson. I have been there on \nat least one occasion. I shared with them the instructions from the \nblack leadership family plan and I am looking forward to their re \nporting to the chairman how well they are doing in implementing \ntheir mission. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Chairman. \nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California. \nMr. DYMALLY. I do want to bring to the committee and the chair \nman the work that the minority staff contributed to these three \nJ.lieces of legislation. They were most helpful and the members of \nthe minority side were  also  most cooperative in trying to bring \nthese pieces of legislation before the full committee. \nThe CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentleman for his observation. \nThe Chair would like to note that our distinguished colleague, \nthe gentleman from Texas, Mr. Combest, has arrived from another \ncommittee hearing and would like to repeat our remarks that we \nwelcome the gentleman and we appreciate his interest in the Com \nmittee on the District of Columbia. We know in many ways it is a \nlabor of love and, you know,  one doesn't always get the kind of \ncredit for tIlls work back in the home district, but it is a necessary \n\n268 \njob and we appreciate the gentleman for volunteering to serve on \nthis important full committee. \nMr. COMBEST. Thank you. \nMr. McKmNEy. Despite the fact, Mr. Chairman, that some of us \nquestioned his sanity in doing so, before you arrived I am sure your \nears were burning because we welcomed YOll.  with glowing plati \ntudes and all other kinds of welcome. And there is my leader over \nthere. \nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Kentucky. \nMr. MAzzou. I apologize for being late. \nThe CHAIRMAN.  The Chair would like to indicate that we kept \nthe roll open for both of you gentlemen, and the clerk will read \nthe Chair vded aye. \nThe CLERK. Mr. Mazzoli? \nMr. MAZZOLI. Aye. \nThe CLERK.

Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, this is the third Congress in which this question has been before the \nbody. Two years ago, the House on a voice vote adopted the change in the law, but \nno action was taken by the other body. Under present law in effect for 50 years or \nmore, the vast majority of offenders convictel1 of violating either a loc&1 District of \nColumbia law or Federal law that applies only in the District served their sentences \nin facilities operated by the District of Columbia, and if they are granted parole, it \nis by the local D.C. Parole Board. One thousand s~ven-hundred offenders, however, \nserve in Federal facilities and are reviewed by the U.S. Board of Parole. \nH.R. 2050, Mr. Speaker, merely establishes that since they are locaJ offenders, \nparole jurisdiction will be with the local parole board. That is the arrangement, as \nyou very well know, Mr. Speaker, in the 50 States and should apply here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. \nThe chairman of our Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education that conducted \nthe hearings on H.R. 2050 is the gentleman from California (Mr. DymalIy]. who will \ngive a further explanation when he has the floor. \nMr. Speaker, Iyield back the balance of my time. \nMr. DYMALT.Y. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, H.R. 2050, is the same bill introduced and passed by the House of \nRepresentatives in the 98th Congress. It would tram,fer parole over District of Co-\n\n270 \nlumbia Code offenders in Federal prisons from the U.S. Parole Commission to the \nDistrict of Columbia Parole Board. \nThere are over 1,700  District of Columbia Code  offenders housed  in Federal \nBureau of Prison facilities. Male District of Columbia Code offenders are placed in \nFederal facilities for selective custody and various other reasons  Female District of \nColumbia offenders sentenced to greater than 1 year terms are routinely placed in \nFederal facilities as a matter of course. This is due to the absence of a local penal \nfacility for female offenders. Most of these female offenders are confined at Alder \nSOn, WV, over 300 miles from the District of Columbia. Others are confmed as far \naway as Texas. \nUnder present law, at section 24-209 of the Distrbt of Columbia Code, the place of \nan offender's confinement determines parole authority. This law is contrary to cur \nrent Federal-State parole practices. According to the U.S. Parole Commission, the \nDistrict of' Columbia is the only local jurisclidion housing inmates in Federal correc \ntion institutions which does not retain its own parole authority. As a result of this \npractice, several Federal lawsuits by both male and female District of Columbia \nCode offenders in Federal prk;ons have been i'iled. \nSeveral points are worth noting. First, since the House passed this bill in the l~'Bt \nCongress, the District of Columbia has revised its parole guidelines, consistent with \ncertain recommendations made by Senator Arlen Specter and U.S. :.lttorney for the \nDistrict of C\"Iumbia, Joseph diGenova. Most important, these revised guidelines are \nmodeled closely after current Federal guideline!;. Second, the overcrowding problem \nin the District has resulted in an increased number of District of Columbia inmates \nbeing transferred to Federal prisons. Third, Congress recently passed the Compre \nhensive Crime Control Act of 1983, which would abolish Federal parole and the U.S. \nParole Commission in 1991. Fourth, section 24-209 became law almost 50 years ago \nund 40 years prior to the Home Rule Act. \nLawsuits filed in response to this provision remain unsolved and continue to con \nsume unnecessary time and expense. This legislation provides a practical and logi \ncally sound remedy to this longstanding problem and 1 believe that now is the time \nfor tbis body to pass this legislation and to save the local government and the local \nand Federal courts further time and money. \nMr. Speaker, I would add that this bill is indeed a step toward home rule. But \nalso, it is a cost efficient step. If passed. this legislation is estimated to save the Fed \neral Government over $1.3 million on the average for the first 5 years after its pas \nsage. Thereafter, the District government will underwrite any expenses attac.hed to \nthe execution of its paroit> authority. \nThus, for the reasons which I've outlined, I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt \nthis measure. \nMr. FAUNTROY. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, I rise in support of all three bUls that have been reported by the \nCommittee on the District of Columbia. I want to focus now, first of all, of course, \nupon H.R. 2050 which transfers parole authority over the District of Columbia of \nfenders housed in Federal prisons from the U.S. Parole Commission to the District \nof C.olumbia Parole Board. \nMr. Speaker, Cllrr(·r.tly there are over 1,400 D.C. Code offenders housed in Federal \nBureau of Prisons Iaciiities. Male D.C. Code offenders are placed in Federal facilities \nfor selective custody, ar.d various other reasons. Female D.C. Code offenders sen \ntenced to greater than I-year terms are placed in Federal facilities due to the ab \nsence of a facility specifically for female offenders here in Washington. Most of \nthese female offenders are confined at Alderson, WV, whence the ch..:lirman of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Dymally, has just come. As he has pointed out to you, it is over \n300 miles away from the District of Columbia.  .. \nMr. DYMALI.Y. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? \nMr. FAUNTROY. I yield to the gentleman. \nMr. DYMALI,Y. I thank the gentleman for yielding. \nMr. Speaker, J am pleased to inform the gen('c,?man that some of the inmates were \nmost appreciative of your interest in this inconvenience which their families suffer, \nand have asked me to conVl'y t{) you the hope that you would continue this fight to \nhave a facility constructlld in the District Qf Columbia. \nMr. FAtlNTROY. I thank the gentleman fol' his leadt'rship in moving H.R. 2050 \nthrough the {.'t)mmittee process and now to the floor. I am sure that thf\\ir hopes will \nbe realized as a result of the vote of the House today. \nMr. Speaker, at present, under the District Code, the determination of parole ju \nrisdiction is controlled by the place of incarceration rather than the jurisdiction of \nconviction. The result is that the District Bourd of Parole makes parole decisions for \nDistrict offenders when they are housed in District institutions, and the U.S. Parole \n\n271 \nCommission  makes  parole decisions  for  District Code  offenders  when they are \nhoused in Federal institutions. \nMr. Speaker. H.R. 2050 expands the authority of the D:strict of Columbia govern \nment by providing it with the right to determine paroles for District Code offenders \nwhether held in District or Federal facilities. \nMr. Speaker, H.R. 2946 establishes an independent jury system for the District of \nColumbia. our local court. This legislation requested by the Superior Court of the \nDistrict !'f Columbia and concerned groups will provide for an efficient jury system \nfor the superior court. This change will help make jury duty for the District of Co \nlumbia citizens a more worthwhile civic duty. \nThe third measure, H.R. 35'78, as amended, Mr. Speaker, will require criminal \nprosecutions concerning violations of the laws of the District of Columbia to be COll \nducted in the name of the District. The bill further provides permanent authority \nfor Hearing <X.mmissioners in the District and modifies certain procedures of the \nDistrict of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission, and the District Commission \non Judicial Disabilities and Tenure. Mr. Speaker, all three bills further the inde \npendence of the District of Columbia judicial and criminal justice system and there \nby enhance self-government. \nI wish to commend the chairman of the District Committee, Congressman Ronald \nDellums, and the ranking minority member, Mr. McKinney. I would also like to \nthank Mr. Dymally, chairman of the Subcommittee on.  Judiciary and Education, \nand Mr. Bliley, the ranking minority member. \nMr. Speaker, as you know, I represent more peopie, taxpayers, than any single \nvoting Member of the House. Indeed, I represent more people who pay taxes in this \ncountry than elect seven Senators, because there are, as you know, more citizens in \nthe District of Columbia than reside in seven States in the Union. So I would prefer \nto have been here not simply to expand the parole authority of the District govern \nment with respect to those convicted of code violations in this city, but to turn the \nentire system over to the local citizenry inasmuch as we, alone among Americans, \nare continued denial of the right to representation in the U.S. House and Senate. \nI would prefer to have passed a measure that would turn the entire court system \nover to the superior court and therefore allow us to fashion our own jury system \nprocedures. Of course, I would certainly have preferred to have passed H.R. 3578, as \namended, as a function of a locally elected mayor and city council, thus providing us \nthe kind of permanent authority that we request here in terms of control of our \ncriminal prosecutions. \nMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of that time that those two Senators who \nwould  have been speaking, rather those Representatives who would have been \nspeaking, had they been freed from the tyranny of taxation ,vithout representation \nhere in the District of Columbia, as I am not. \nMr. BLlL£Y. Mr. Speaker, as the ranking minority member of the Judiciary and \nEducation Subcommittee of the Committee on the District of Columbia, I rise in sup \nport of n.R. 2050. \nAs explained by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Dymally, \nthis bill is a question of equity. The fact is that some convicted District of Columbia \ncriminals are sent to the District's prison at Lorton and some are sent to various \nFederal institutions around the country. For those people at Lorton, the District \nParole Board has jurisdiction, for those men and women in Federal prisons, the Fed \neral Parole Board and its rules and regulations apply. \nSince the two parole authorities with responsibility for District prisoners have dif \nferent criteria and regulations as well as the fact that different conditions may lead \n..  to different attitudes and therefore different behavior patterns affecting parole pos \nsibilities, I believe that it is a simple question of equity that the District of Columbia \nhave sale parole authority over its own citizens. \nI speak for the minority members of the committee when I say that this legisla \ntion is fair and equitable for the people and the government of the District of Co \nlumbia and we endorse its passage. \nMr. DEI.LUMS. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the bill. \nThe previous question was ordered. \nThe bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third \ntime. and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. \n\n272 \nGENERAL LEAVE \nMr. DELLUMS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have \n5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the bill just \npassed. \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

Challenging compliance with selection procedures. \n\"(a) A party may challenge the composition of a jury by a motion for appropriate \nrelief. A challenge shall be brought and decided before any individual juror is exam \nined, unless the Court orders otherwise. The motion shall be in writing, supported \nby affidavit, and shall specify the facts constituting the grounds for the challenge. If \nthe Court so determines, the motion may be decided on the basis of the affidavits \nfiled with the challenge. If the Court orders trial of the challenge, witnesses may be \nexamined on oath by the Court and may be so examined by either party. \n\"(hl If the Court determines that in selecting a grand or petit jury there has been \na substantial failure to comply with this chapter, the Court shall stay the proceed \nings pending the selection of a jury in conformity with this chapter, quash the in \ndictment, or grant other appropriate relief. \n\"(c) The procedures prescribed by this section are the exclusive means by which a \nperson accused of a crime, the District of Columbia, the United States, or a party in \na civil case may challenge a jury on the ground that the jury was not selected in \nconformity with this chapter.

Amounts repre \nT  senting reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with jury service may be \npaid to such employees to the extent provided in the jury system plan. \n\"§ 11-1913. Protection of employment of jurors. \n\"(al An employer shall not deprive an employee of employment, threaten, or oth \nerwise coerce an employee with respect to employment because the employee re \nceives a summons, responds to a summons, serves as a juror. or attends Court for \nprospective jury service. \n\"(b) An employer who violates subsection (a) is guilty of criminal contempt.

If an employee prevails in an action under this subsection, that \nemployee shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees fixed by the court. \n\"§ 11-1914. Preservation of records. \n\"(a) All records and lists compiled and maintained in connection with the selec \ntion and service of jurors shall be preserved for the length of time specified in the \nju~ system plan. \nI (b) 'l'he contents of any records or lists used in connection with the selection \nprocess shall not be disclosed, except in connection with the preparation or presen \ntation of a motion under § 11-1910, or until all individuals selected to serve as grand \nor petit jurors from such lists have been discharged. \n\"§ 11-1915. Fraud in the selection process. \n\"An individual who commits fraud in the processing or selection of jurors or pro \nspective jurors, either by causing any name to be iriserted into any list maliciously \nor by causing any name to be deleted from any list maliciously (including malicious \ndata entry or the alter.ing of any data processing machine or any set of instructions \nor programs which control data processing equipment for such malicious purpose), is \nguilty of the crime of jury tampering, and, upon conviction, may be punished by a \nfine of not more than $10,000, imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. \nThis section shall not limit any other provisions of law concerning the crime of jury \ntampering. \n\"§ 11-1916. Grand jury; additional grand jury. \n\"(a) A grand jury serving in the District of Columbia may take cognizance of all \nmatters brought before it regardless of whether an indictment is returnable in the \nFederal or District of Columbia courts. \n\"(b) If the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia certifies in writing \nto the chief judge that an additional grand jury is required, the judge may in his or \nher discretion order an additional grand jury summoned which shall be drawn at \nsuch time as he or she .fesignates. Unless discharged by order of the judge, the addi \ntional grand jury shall serve until the end of the term for which it is drawn. \n\"§ 11-1917. Coordination and Cooperation of Courts. \n\"To the extent feasible, the Superior Court and the United States District Court \nshall consider the respective needs of each court in the qualification, selection, and \nservice of jurors. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent such courts \nfrom entering into any agreement for sharing resources and facilities (including \nautomated data processing hardware and software, forms, postage, and other re \nsources). \n\"§ 11-1018. Effect of Invalidity. \n\"If any provision of this Act or the application of that provision is held invalid, \nsuch invalidity shall not affect any other provision or application of this Act which \ncan be given effect without the invalid ·provision or application.\". \nSEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE. \n(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the provisions of this Act shall take effect \n180 days after the date of enactment of this Act. \n(b) Upon enactment of this Act, the Board of Judges shall have authority to pro \nmulgate and adopt a jury system plan in accordance with this Act and the Court \nand the clerk of the Court shall have authority to take all necessary actions prelimi \nnary to the assumption of the administration of an independent jury system Under \nthis Act. \nMr. DELLUMS. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Speaker, this bill \nrelieves the U.S. courts of the task of callin~ jurors to serve at trials in local District \nof Columbia courts. The present practice IS a holdover from 1970, when the U.S. \ncourt handled felony trials and appeals for local offenses. In 1970, the Congress cre-\n\n277 \nIt \nated a trial court and appeals court especially to handle such local cases. If H.R. \n2946 becomes law, the local couri will handle just the local cases, and the U.S. dis \ntrict court would just call jurors for Federal cases. \nA full explanation of the bill will be given by my di<Jtinguished colleague, the gen \ntleman from California [Mr. Dymally), who chairs the Subcommittee on Judiciary \nand Education, when he is recognized. \nMr. Speaker, with that brief explanation, I yield back the balance of my time. \nMr. DYMALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, this bill is quite simple. H.R. 2946 is a bill to establish an independ \nent jury system for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. \nIn 1970, this body and Congress passed the District of Columbia Court Reform \nAct, which became effective in 1971. We established a D.C. court system expressly \nanalogous to State court systems, After nearly 15 years of self-management and \ncompetitive efficiency, the court is prepared to administer its own jury system, inde \npendent of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \nMost important, it is quite capable of doing so and at the same time continuing to \nwork closely and cooperate with the U,S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \nHence, the local district court is \"strongly supportive\" of this transition. As do State \ncourts, the local courts here have local needs which, like State courts, they should \nhave the authority to address. \nAgainst this backdrop, I urge my fellow Members of this august body to -adopt \nH.R. 2946. \nMr. BULEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr, Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor and as the ranking member of the Subcolnmit \ntee on Judiciary and Education in strong support of H.R. 2946. \nThis legislation is needed for the District of Columbia court system to effectively \nand efficiently deal with the large caseload of court proceedings that it is faced \nwith. Last year this body authorized seven new superior court judges for the District \nof Columbia. The addition of these positions has overstrained the limited capacity of \nthe present jury selection system employed by the District courts. \nThe courts have also instituted ~he \"one day, one trial\" method of jury duty \nwhich places larger demands on the panels of jury selection than the traditional \nmethod of jury service. I support one day, one trial and I am proud of the work that \nthe chairman of the subcommittee and I did in achieving this carefully written bi \npartisan bill. The gentleman from California and myself worked hard on this legis \nlation and I feel confident that I speak for the minority on the committee when I \nsay that we enthusiastically support this bill. \nMr. DVMALLY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? \nMr. BULEY. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from California. \nMr. DVMALLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take titis opportunity to express my deep \ngratitude to the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. BIiley] for his support of this legisla \ntion and other legislation affecting the judiciary in the District of Columbia. The \ngentleman from Virginia has been most cooperative in the committee's delibera \ntions, and I wish to express my thanks to him. \nMr. BULEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Dymally], \nand J yield back the balance of my time. \nMr. DELLUMS. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, I rise simply to compliment the gentleman from California [Mr. \nDymallyJ and the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley] for their diligent activity \nand their conscientious efforts as the chairperson of the Subcommittee on Judiciary \nand Education and the ranking minority member of that subcommittee. Both of \nthese gentlemen are very delightful members to work with. They are conscientious, \nhsrd-working members who are very diligent about the business of trying to rectify \nmany of the inadequacies that exist between the Federal Government and the resi \n..  dents of the District of Columbia. \nMy purpose in rising WflS only to make that statement, Mr. Speaker, and I yield \nback the balance of my time. \nMr. BLAz. Mr. Speakef', I move to strike the last word. \n(Mr. BIM asked and was given permission to include extraneous matter.) \nMr. BLAz. Mr. Speaker, I present for inclusion in the Record various items of cor \nrespondence from the Depnrtment of Justice objecting to the legislation presently \nbeing considered. Those items are as follows: \n\n278 \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nOFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, \nWashington, DC, October 28, 1985. \nHon. ROBERT R. IvlIcHEL, \nMinority Leader, U.S. House of Representatiues, \nWashington, DC. \nDEAR CONGJiESSMAN MICHEL: The following bills are scheduled for floor action on \nMonday, October 28,1985 on the District Calendar: \nH.R. 2050.-a bill to transfer parole authority over District of Columbia offenders \nhoused in federal prison from the United States Parole Commission to the District \nof Columbia Parole Board. \nH.R. 2946.-a hilI to establish an independertt jury system for the Superior Court \nof the District of Columbia. \nH.R. 3578.-(We are not sure which bill H.R. 3578 or R.R. 3592 will be scheduled \nfor floor action. Originally, R.R. 3370 was introduced on September 19, 1985. A staff \nmark·up resulted in H.R. 3578 being introduced on October 17, which the Commit \ntee reported out. Subsequent to the Committee mark·up, H.R. 3592, which is a clean \nversion of H.R. 3578 with additional amendments, was introduced.)-a bill to pro \nvide permanent authority for hearing commissioners in the District of Columbia \ncourts, to modify certain procedures of the District of Columbia courts, to modifY \ncertain procedures of the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission and \nthe District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, and for \nother purposes. \nThe Department of Justice has sent letters of opposition on H.R. 2050 and H.R. \n2946 to the Committee on the District of Columbia (copies attached). \nn.R.2050 \nThe Department opposes H.R. 2050 for several reasons: \n(1) Place of incarceration rather than jurisdiction of correction determines parole \njurisdiction under the D.C. Code. \n(2) The policies and procedures of the D.C. Board of Parole were called into serio \nous question during a hearing on similar legislation (H.R. 3369) during the 98th \nCongress. \n(3) New guidelines established by D.C. Board of Parole in the Spring of 1985 have \nnot yet bean analyzed for efficiency and effectiveness. \n(4) The U.S. Sentencing Commission established under P.L. 98-473 (Comprehen \nsive Crime Control Act of 1984) and recently confirmed by the Senate will have to \naddress this issue as it determines how to phase out the U,S. Parole Commission \n(abolished under P.L. 98-473). \n(5) A piecemeal approach to the D.C. sentencing and correctional practices is a \nreal and direct threat to law enforcement interests in th'.: District, especially since \nAugust of 1985 when the Federal Bureau of Prisons started to assume custody of all \nD.C. Code violators sentenced in D.C. Superior Court to assist the District govern \nment in responding to a court order to reduce overcrowding at its correctional facili· \nties. \nH.lt.29'16 \nWhile B.R. ~946 contains significant improvements over the jury selection system \nnow in effect in the federal Courts, e.g. broadening the base of persons who can be \nsummoned for jury duty, narrowing the number of automatic exclusions from jury \nservice, and increasing the penalties for certain fraudulent conduct in the jury se \nlection process, we do not believe that a bifurcated approach to the D.C. jury selec· \ntion system-one for the local trial court and one for the federal trial court-is a  r \nprudent or efficient one. Such u bjfurcated approach would ent.ail administrative dif \nficulties, dUplication of effort and additional cost to the federal government. For \nthese reasons, we oppose H.R. 2946 in its present form,  but we would consider \nchanges to the Jurr Selection and Service Act to incorporate the improvements con \ntained in H.R. 2946. \nH.a.3578 \nAlthough this Department has not been asked to comment on H.R. 3370, H.R. \n3578 or H,R. 3592, we do have concerns about several provisions contained in these \nrelated bills, H.R. 3592 (introduced as a clean version of H.R. 3578 but with several \ntechnicai amendments) appears to  be  the bill scheduled for floor action. We do \nobject to Section 2 of this bill which requires the U.s. Attorney for District of Co· \n\n279 \nlumbia to compile an annual report by category of offense and conviction of D.C. \nCode violators, and violators of U.S. law exclusive to the District of Columbia. The \nmaterial is now available and a matter of public record. To have the local U.S. At \ntorney's office utilize the manpower and resources necessary to compile and publish \nthis report would create serious budgetary problems for that office-an issue the \nCommittee failf!d tQ address. \nSections 10-11 of H.R. 3592 would govern public access to materials of the Judi \ncial Nomination Commission. It is our belief that confidentiality promotes candor in \nsuch proceedings but we recognize that there may be instances where total secrecy \nis unfair. Section 13\" requires in part that the record and materials med in connec \ntion with the Judicial Disability and Tenure Commission be kept confidential unless \nthe judge whose conduct or health is at issue authorizes disclosure. It is not clear \nwhether the judge can authorize disclosure of some of the information while sup \npressing the rest. If so. this could result in presenting a very one-sided picture to the \npublic. We suggest that either of the following approaches would be preferable: \nm \nrequiring a judge who wants part of the record tQ be made public to con \nsent to all of it being made public, or \n!2l following the rule which applies in grand jury proceedings, i.e., the record \nis kept secret and the decision makers are SWOrn to secrecy, but witnesses may \ntell the public about their testimony and submissions if they wish. \nWe would appreciat~ any assistance you could give in making our views known on \nthese issutis. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has advised this Department and that \nthere is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Ad \nministration's program. \nSincerely, \nPHILLIP D. BRADY. \nActing Assistant Attorney General. \nU.S. DJ;;PARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nOFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, \nWashington. DC, September 27, 1985. \nHon. HONALD Df:LI.OMS, \nChairman. ('ommiltee on the District of Columbia. \nWa.9hington. DC. \nDEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your request for the views of the De \npartment of JustiCt' on H.R. 2050. a bill \"to give to the Board of Parole of the ms \ntrict of Columbia exclusive power and authority to make parole determination con \ncerning prisoners convicted of violating any law of the District of Columbia, or any \nlaw of the United States applicable exclUSively to the District.\" As set forth in more \ndetail below, the Department of Justice believes that the change sought by this bill \nwould not improve tll(' law enforcement and corrections programs in the District of \nt\"olumbia and we therefore oppose this bill. Furthermore, we believe that Congress \nshould not undertake piecemeal revisions of the D.C. corrections programs until \ncompletion of a thorough and comprehensive review of all sentencing and correc-\ntional practices.  . \nAt present under the D.C. Code, the determination of parole jurisdiction is con \ntrolled by the place of incarceration rather than the jurisdiction of conviction. The \nresult is that the D.C. Board of Parole makes parole decisions for D.C. Code offend \net's when they are housed in D.C. institutions and the Unitcd States Parole Commis \nsion makes parole decisions for D.C. Gode offenders when they are housed in federal \ninstitutions. At the present time over 1.400 D.C. Code offenders are held in Federal \nBureau of Prisons facilities. This represents the designed capacity of three modern \ncorrectional institutions. Although some of these are in federal custody because of \ntheir ('xtremely violent criminal histories or to separate them from other District of \nColumbia inmates, the bulk of them are in federal cu.stody ~rimarily because of \nshort.ages of space to house inmates in the District of ColumbIa system. Thus, two \nfactors not addressed in H.R. 2()50 are the real burden to the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons of confining this large group of local offenders and the serious problems in· \nvo)v(>d in adding these geographically dispersed inmates to the D.C. Parole Board's \ncaseload. \nIn the 19:1O's when toe D.C. Board of Parole was established, this divided jurisdic \ntional scheme may have met correctional nl'eds. The Comprehensive Crime Control \nAct of 19?1;i abolishes the United States Parole Commission in 1991, however, and \nlegislative attention must clrurly be given to the questions of future parole responsi-\n\n280 \nbility for D.C. Code offenders designated to Federal institutions. At the same time \nevery effort must be made to insure that the District of Columbia will provide ade \nquate prison space to house its sentenced criminals. \nA larger question is what role should parole serve as a correctional tool in the \nDistrict of Columbia? The legislative history of the Comprehensive Crime Control \nAct of 1984, P.L. 98-473, clearly reflects the Congressional determination that the \n\"rehabilitation model\" upon which the Federal sentencing and parole system was \nbased is no longer valid. S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Congress, 1st Sess. 38 (1983). Based \nupon a study spanning a decade conducted by the National Commission on Reform \nof Federal Criminal Law, it was concluded that the Federal sentencing and parole \nsystem resulted in significant disparities in criminal sentences. As stated in the \nSenate Report: \n\"The shameful disparity in criminal sentences is a  major flaw in the existing \ncriminal justice system, and makes it clear that the system is ripe for reform. Cor \nrecting our arbitrary and capricious method of sentencing will not be a panacea for \nall of the problems which confront the administration of criminal justice, but it will \nconstitute a significant step forward. \n\"The [Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (CCCA») meets the critical chal \nlenges of sentencing reform. The [CCCA's] sweeping provisions are designed to struc \nture judicial sentencing discretion, eliminate indeterminate sentencing, phase out \nparole release, and make criminal sentencing fairer and more certain. The current \neffort constitutes an important attempt to reform the manner in which we sentence \nconvicted offenders. The Committee believes that the [CCCA] represents a major \nbreakthrough in this area.\" ld. at 65. \nThe current D.C. sentencing and parole system does not reflect this new under \nstanding of the limitations of the \"rehabilitation model\" as described above. \nIn addition, the District of Columbia parole system has other demonstrated prob \nlems. When we reviewed similar legislation two years ago [H.R. 3369], this matter \nwas discussed in detail in our letter dated July 25, 1983 from Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Robert A. McConnell to you. The Department noted at that time that the \nD.C. Board of Parole, according to its 1982 annual report, granted parole at initial \nhearings to 61 percent Qf the adult offenders and that 73 percent of the remainder \nwere granted parole upon a rehearil 'P' The Board also reported however, that based \nupon a study of a StoliOcted sample 01 322 parolees released on parole between 1977 \nand 1979, 52 percent were re-arrested during the first two years of parole supervi \nsion. Of the parolees who were re-arrested, 77 percent were convicted for crimes \ncommitted while on parole. Given the very high percenmge of parolees released at \nthe time of initial parole consideration and the very high rate of recidivist criminal \nactivity among those released, the policies and procedUres of the D.C. Board of \nParole were called into serious question. \nWe also pointed out that despite the large number of D.C. parolees who commit \ncrimes following parole release, parole apparently was revoked in a relatively small \npercentage of the cases. In that regard, the D.C. Board of Parole reported that of \nthose  parolees in its 1977-1979 sample who  were convicted of crimes while on \nparole, parole was revoked because of the new offense in less than one half of the \ncases. Although the reason for this statistic was not explained, it appears that it \nmay be attributed to the D.C. Parole Board policy of not issuing parole violator wal\" \nrants for certain offenses. In this regard, the Board listed in its 1982 Annual Report \nthe types of offenses it terms \"Eligible Offenses\" for purposes of issuance of pru-ole \nviolator warrants. It appears that as a matter of policy, the Board will not issue \nparole violator warrants for burglary of commercial establishments, possession of \nfirearms (unless the defendant is arrested with the weapon in his hand or on his \nperson), grand larceny, embezzlement, fraud, forgery and uttering and for a host of \nother violations of the District of Columbia Code or the United States Code. \nThis apparent policy which allows substantial numbers of parolees to continue on \nparole even after f,rrest and conviction of serious crimes was of significant concern \nto us in the past., 0I f these matters have not yet been completely remedied, and it \nmay be too early  conclude that they have, then similar concern is presently war \nranted. Under H.R. 2050, the jurisdiction of the D.C. Board of Parole would be sub \nstantially expanded to include those D.C. Code offenders presently under the juris \ndiction of the U.S. Parole Commission. These offenders, how~yer, include some of \nthE> most dangerous and violent criminals cOllvicted in the District of Columbia. Pre \nmature release of such individuals pursuant to existing parole policies would pose a \nreal and direct threat to law enforcement interests in the District of Columbia. \nWe beHeve it is time for a thorough legislative review of District of Columbia sen \ntencing and correctional practices. A major eJo,pansion of the capacity of D.C. correc \ntional facilities is essential. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seriously overcrowded \n\n281 \nand can no longer accept the overload of the District of Columbia system. This is \nespecially true in light of the increased D.C. prison population that would result, at \nleast temporarily, from a more responsibly run parole system. Replacement of the \nparole system in the District of Columbia by a sentencing guideline system similar \nto that adopted by Congress in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 should \nbe considered. While expansion of the D.C. inmate capacity must begin at once, \nother changes can be more thoroughly considered than is done in H.R. 2050. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has advised this Department that there is \nno objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administra \ntion's program. \nSincerely, \nPHILLIP D. BRADY, \nActing Assistant Attorney General. \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nOFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE ANP INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, \nWashington, DC, ~(ly 31, 1985. \nHon. RONALD V. DELLUMS, \nChairman, Committee on District of Columbia, U.S. House of Representatives, Wash \nington, DC. \nDEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is to proffer the views of the Department of Justice on \nH.R. 2946, a bill that would establis11 an independent jury selection system for the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia. While we believe that some of the \nchanges from current law contained in H.R. 2946 would constitute significant im \nprovements over the jury selection system now in effect in the federal courts, we \noppose the bill for the reasons set forth below. \nJury selection for both the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia is now governed by a \nsingle process established by the Jury Selection and Service Act (28 U.S.C. 1861, et \nseq,) and administered by the United States District Court for the District of Colum \nbia. If H.R. 2946 were enacted, there would exist within the District of Columbia \ntwo separate jury selection systems-one for the local trial court and one for the \nfederal trial court. Inevitably, such a bifurcated approach would entail administra \ntive difficulties, duplication of effort, and additional cost to the federal government, \nnotwithstanding the provision of the bill that encourages the federal  and local \ncourts to share resources and facilities to the extent feasible. \nH.R. 2946 would improve the current jury selection system by broadening the \nbase .of persons who can be summoned for jury duty, by narrO\\ving the number of \nautomatic exclusions from jury service, and by increasing the penalties for certain \nfraudulent conduct in the jury selection process. However, we are not persuaded \nthat the prOSpect of such advances :Narrants the establishment of another jury selec \ntion system in the District of Columbia, with all of the drawbacks that such a course \nwould entail. Rather, we think the better course would be to consider amending the \nJury Selection and Service Act to incorporate the improvements contained in H.R. \n2946. Such an approach would improve the jury selection process not only in the \nSuperior Court but in all federal courts. Equally important, it would preserve the \numfied selection system currently in effect in the District of Columbia, thereby \navoiding the administrative and financial costs of a bifurcated system. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to \nthe submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program. \nSincerely, \nPHILLIP D. BRADY, \nActing Assistant Attorney General. \nMr. DELLUMs. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the bill. \nThe previous question was ordered. \nT \nThe bill was ordered to be engrol'lSed and read a third time, was read the third \ntime, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. \nGENERAL LEAVE \nMr. DELLuMs. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have \n5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend  their remarks on the bill just \npassed. \n\n282 \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

The question is on the committee amendments. \nThe committee amendments were agreed to. \nMr. DELLuMs. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, this bill makes certain changes in the local courts in Washington, \nDC, suggested by local practitioners, officials, and the courts, and makes permanent \nauthority for hearing commlSsioners, authority which Congress has granted from \nyear to year in appropriation bills. \nHearings were held before our Subcommittee on the Judiciary and Education \nchaired by the gentleman from California (Mr. Dymaily). with the ranking minority \nmember being the distinguished gentleman from  Virginia (Mr.  BIiley],  each of \nwhom will give a further explanation of the bill at the appropriate time. \nWith the brief introductory set of remarks, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance \nof my time. \nMr. DYMALLY  Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \nMr. Speaker, l'ince the 98th Congress, the Subcommittee on Judiciary and Educa \ntion has focused lts attention on improving the administration of Justice in the Dis \ntrict of Columbia, and at the same time transferring to the District authority over \nits agencies, consist.ent with the legislative intent underlying the District of Colum \nbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 and the District of Columbia \nSelf-Government Act and Government Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended. \nThis legislution emanates from these significant legislative developments. It re \nflects both self-government considerations and the improvement and efficiency of \nthe local judicial system. The bill itself evolves from recommendations of the Dis \ntrict of Columbia Court Study Committee and the District of Columbia courts. \nA brief history of its development are in order. In 1978, the District of Columbia \nBar Association formed the District of Columbia Court Study Committee. This com \nmittee (commonly known as the Horsky Committee) was charged with evaluating \nthe District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 and \nmaking approprial  recommendations for improving the judicial system. Over a 4-\nyear period, the Cl> ;rt study committee conducted its mission. Certain provisions in \nthis bill represent the committee's work product. \nIn sum, H.R. 3578 would create permanent authority for District of Columbia \nhearing commissioners, eliminate duplicate judicial financial reporting, provide au \nthority for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to answer certain undecided \nquestions of District of Columbia law pending in other courts and amend a panoply \nof provisions involving judicial nomination, reappointment, and tenure processes. \nIt would also require the U.S. attorney to publish an annual report regarding its \nDistrict of Columbia criminal justice activity. Further, it would modify the appoint \nment panel for the Board of Trustees of the Public Defender Service. \nThese noncontt'Oversial provisions would further improve loci! judicial nomina \ntion and tenure processes and at the same time move the local government one step \nfurther toward self-government. Most important, it is estimated that the bill would \nsave the local government over $600,000 a. year at no cost to the Federal Govern \nment. \nMr. Bw.EY. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. \n\n287 \nMr. Speaker, I rise to support the passage of H.R. 3578. This bill makes a number \nof minor, but important and needed corrections in the procedures and efficiency of \nthe District of Columbia courts. \nMr. Dymally, the chairman of the Judiciary and Education Subcommittee, was \ndiligent in his efforts to craft a piece of valuable legislation that all parties could \nagree to. I am pleased to be able to lend my support to his efforts and to thank him \nfor his bipartisan spirit. \nMr, Speaker, the minority !flembers of the District of Columbia committee sup-\nport passage of H,R. 3578. \nMr. DELLUMS. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the bill. \nThe previous question was ordered. \nThe bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the \nthird time, and passed and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. \nGENERAL LEA VB \nMr. DELLUMS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may have \n5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the bill just \npassed. \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nCalifornia? \nThere was no objection. \no \nf ",
