DIAZ, et al., Plaintiffs, \nv. \nSAN JOSE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, et al., Defendants. \nNo. C-71-2130 RFP (SJ). \nUnited States District Court, N. D. California. \nJuly 15, 1981. \n623*623 624*624 Cynthia L. Rice, Community Legal Services, San Jose, Cal., for plaintiffs \nArnulfo M. Diaz, et al. \nMichael di Leonardo, Sunnyvale, Cal., for defendants San Jose Unified School District, et \nal. \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nPECKHAM, Chief Judge. \nI PROCEEDINGS \nThis suit was originally instituted in 1971. Plaintiffs, on behalf of a class of all Spanish-\nsurnamed students enrolled in the San Jose Unified School District (\"SJUSD\") and their \nparents, charged that the School District was operating a segregated public school system \nin violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Jurisdiction is founded in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343(3) and \n1343(4). \nThis case is now before the Court on remand from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 612 \nF.2d 411 (1979), after this court initially ruled in favor of the defendants after trial on the \nmerits. 412 F.Supp. 310 (1976). The procedural history of this matter up until the point of \nthat initial judgment in this court, as well as the general factual background of the case, may \nbe found in our initial opinion, 412 F.Supp. at 311-15, and need not be repeated here. The \nNinth Circuit, upon appeal, vacated the judgment of this court and remanded the matter to \nus for further proceedings, in light of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court \nin Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 \n(\"Columbus\"), and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 \nL.Ed.2d 720 (\"Dayton\") (1979), and in light of the Circuit Court's opinion issued in \nconjunction with the remand. \nAfter the Ninth Circuit's mandate issued in February of 1980, this court ordered both sides \nto brief and argue their proposals for further proceedings in light of the remand decision. \n\n \n \nAfter a hearing held on June 4, 1980, this court ordered the case decided on the existing \nevidentiary record, and instructed both sides to file briefs addressing the question of \nwhether the Ninth Circuit opinion remanding this case and the decisions \nin Columbus and Dayton compel a result different from this court's previous judgment. Oral \nargument was held on this issue on October 31, 1980. \nThis court has conducted an extensive review and consideration of this matter. We have \nstudied the Ninth Circuit's remand opinion and the two Supreme Court rulings, as well as \nother Supreme Court and lower court cases which have addressed issues relevant to this \nmatter. We have conducted a complete review of the transcript of the original trial on the \nmerits, as well as the transcripts of the hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction, \nwhich was conducted in 1971. We have also carefully 625*625 re-examined the exhibits \nintroduced into evidence by both sides in connection with this case. The court concludes \nthat it must once again find in favor of the defendants. For the reasons discussed below, the \nevidence in the record does not, on balance, support a finding of segregative intent, a \nfinding necessary under federal law in order to impose liability on the defendants. \nII DAYTON AND COLUMBUS \nOn remand, the Ninth Circuit ordered that this court reconsider the evidence in this case in \nlight of the Supreme Court decisions in Dayton and Columbus, which were decided on the \nsame day at the end of the October 1978 Term. \nDayton involved a school system which the Court of Appeals had found was de \njure segregated at the time of the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 \nS.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (\"Brown\"). As such, it was under a continuous affirmative \nduty since that time to dismantle that dual system, \"to take whatever steps might be \nnecessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated \nroot and branch.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38, 88 S.Ct. 1689, \n1693-94, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968); see also Columbus, 443 U.S. at 458-59, 99 S.Ct. at 2947. \nThe Court of Appeals had found that in a number of different instances, the Dayton school \nauthorities had failed to take steps to fulfill this affirmative obligation to dismantle the \nsegregated system. The Supreme Court's decision upheld the conclusions of the Court of \nAppeals 1) that there was a de jure system of segregated schools in place at the time of the \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 2) that this meant that the school district \nwas under an affirmative obligation since that time to dismantle that segregated system, \nand 3) that the school district had failed to fulfill that obligation. \nThe case before this court is in a much different posture. There was no evidence, nor any \ncontention by the plaintiffs, that a de jure system of segregated schools existed at the time \nof Brown. Rather, virtually all the evidence in this case focused on the actions of the school \nauthorities commencing in 1963, when the school board first acknowledged the need to \neliminate segregation. Having not established any pre-Brown de jure system of segregation, \nthe plaintiffs cannot rely on any continuing obligation on the part of the school district to \ndismantle such a segregated system by affirmative acts of integration. Rather, the plaintiffs \nare obliged to show that the segregation which exists in the schools was brought about by \n\n \n \npurposeful discrimination by state officials. As this court noted in its prior decision, 412 \nF.Supp. at 328-29, Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d \n548 (1973) established that evidence of the de facto segregation of schools is not sufficient \nto prove a violation of the fourteenth amendment; rather, the plaintiff must prove not only \nthat the defendants' actions created or maintained racial or ethnic imbalance in the schools, \nbut also that those actions were motivated by segregative intent. \nThis, of course, brings us to the heart of the problem facing the courts and the crux of the \ndifficulties which led the Court of Appeals to remand this case to this court. From what \nactions, circumstances, and explanations is the court to infer segregative intent? What \nevidence supports such an inference, and what countervailing evidence is sufficient to \ncounter such an inference? \nThe Supreme Court offered some guidance on this issue in Dayton. It stated that proof of \nforeseeability is not to be taken, as a general proposition, to make out a prima facie case of \nsegregative intent, nor does it routinely shift the burden of persuasion to the defendants. \nThe court then stated, \"[o]f course, as we hold in Columbus today, ... proof of foreseeable \nconsequences is one type of quite relevant evidence of racially discriminatory \npurpose....\" 443 U.S. at 536 n.9, 99 S.Ct. at 2978 n.9. The Court rejected any hard and fast \nrule on the inferences to be drawn from, and importance to be placed on, evidence that \nstate officials took actions which would have the natural, probable and \nforeseeable 626*626 consequences of perpetuating segregation. The Court considered it \nsimply one of many types of evidence which must be weighed in the balance of the overall \ncase. \nThe decision in the Columbus case contains more guidance applicable to the case \npresently before this court. In that case, the lower courts had found that, while there was \na de jure system of segregation in place in Columbus at the time of the Brown decision, \nthere had also been several acts of intentional segregation after 1954. In upholding the \nlatter finding of the district court, the Supreme Court pointed to several types of evidence of \ndirect relevance to the San Jose situation. The Court noted in particular the evidence in the \nrecord concerning the selection of sites for new schools in Columbus. Since 1950, 103 \nschools had been built in Columbus; 87 opened with racially identifiable student bodies. The \nCourt noted that this segregative result was \"reasonably foreseeable under the \ncircumstances in light of the sites selected.\" It went on to note, however, that there was no \nneed to rely on an inference of discriminatory purpose based on the reasonable \nforeseeability of the segregative consequences of the district's choice of sites, for the record \nreflected that the school board had been specifically warned about the segregative \nconsequences of its actions and that alternatives had been proposed which would have \nincreased integration. 443 U.S. at 462-63 n.11, 99 S.Ct. at 2980 n.11. \nThe Court also put great emphasis on the fact that the board of education was presented \nwith many recommendations over the years which would have countered some of the \nsegregation in the Columbus system; the school board consistently refused to follow up on \nany of those recommendations. These failures to act were particularly important because \n\"the Columbus system grew rapidly in terms of geography and number of students, creating \nmany cross-roads where the Board could either turn toward segregation or away from \n\n \n \nit.\" 443 U.S. at 463 n.12, 99 S.Ct. at 2980 n.12. Under all these circumstances, the \nSupreme Court upheld the district court's inference of segregative intent \"`from the \nColumbus defendants' failures, after notice, to consider predictable racial consequences of \ntheir acts and omissions when alternatives were available which would have eliminated or \nlessened racial imbalance.'\" Id., quoting 429 F.Supp. 229, 240 (S.D.Ohio 1977). \nThe Court, in Columbus, also reiterated the use of evidence of foreseeable segregative \neffect to infer segregative intent. It emphasized, as it did in Dayton, that evidence of \nforeseeable consequences of actions, without more, is not sufficient to establish a \nconstitutional violation. The Court stressed that the issue to be addressed by the trial court \nis whether or not the state officials acted with a \"forbidden purpose.\" Foreseeable effects is \nsimply one kind of evidence among other types from which an inference of intent or purpose \ncan be drawn. Again, the Court made it clear that the role of the trial court is to weigh this \nevidence, along with, and in the context of, all the rest of the evidence, and decide whether \nan inference should be drawn that the state officials made the decisions which led to the \nsegregative result with discriminatory or segregative intent. 443 U.S. at 464-65, 99 S.Ct. at \n2950. \nIII OTHER SUPREME COURT CASES \nThe court has also re-evaluated the record in this case in light of three other decisions \nhanded down by the Supreme Court since the trial of this case. These decisions all attempt \nto demark more clearly the barrier in the law between actions which result in segregation or \ndisparate impact on a racial or ethnic group and actions which are motivated by the intent or \npurpose to discriminate. The latter actions are subject to liability under federal law; the \nformer are not. \nIn Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), the Supreme \nCourt rejected the notion that discriminatory impact of, or result from, state action is \nsufficient to support a finding of a constitutional violation. The Court insisted that a \ndiscriminatory purpose had to be 627*627 found to make out a violation under the \nFourteenth Amendment. Id. at 239-42, 96 S.Ct. at 2047, 2049. That purpose had to be \nfound from the examination of the totality of the facts, and while impact might on occasion \nsuffice to show discriminatory intent, this would be true in those cases where the decisions \nor actions which caused the discriminatory impact were not explainable on nonracial \ngrounds. Id. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2049. \nThe type of evidence which might be relied on to infer discriminatory purpose was further \nelaborated on by the Supreme Court in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing \nDevelopment Corporation, 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). In that case, \nthe Court reiterated that the discriminatory purpose of the decision-makers had to be shown \nto be at least a motivating factor in their actions. Evidence of discriminatory impact, while \nperhaps providing some support for such a finding in the overall context of the specific case, \nwas not in and of itself sufficient. Id. at 265-268, 97 S.Ct. at 563, 564. The Court listed four \nother factors, along with impact, which might be determinative of the issue of discriminatory \npurpose: 1) the historical background of the decision; 2) the specific events surrounding the \n\n \n \ndecision; 3) any departures from the normal procedure of decision-making; and 4) any \nlegislative or administrative history related to the issue or subject decided. Id. There is no \nindication that this list was meant to be exhaustive of the evidence to be looked to by the \ntrial court in determining the issue of discriminatory purpose. It is simply illustrative of the \nprocess in which the trial court must engage in deciding whether the objective facts support \nan inference of the ultimate relevant subjective fact, intent to discriminate. \nFinally, the Court shed further light on the role of the foreseeability of discriminatory impact \nof a decision in the trial court's evaluation of intent in Personnel Administrator of \nMassachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979). In the \ncourse of rejecting a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against women in the operation \nof Massachusetts' veteran preference laws, the Court explicitly rejected the idea that the \nforeseeability of the discriminatory impact of an action is, in and of itself, sufficient to \nsupport a finding of discriminatory intent and, hence, of liability. The Court wrote: \n\"Discriminatory purpose,\" however, implies more than intent as volition or intent as \nawareness of consequences .... It implies that the decision-maker ... selected or reaffirmed \na particular course of action at least in part \"because of,\" not merely \"in spite of,\" its adverse \neffects upon an identifiable group. \nId. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 (citation omitted; footnotes omitted). The court again, however, \nmade it clear that the necessary intent must generally be gleaned from objective evidence, \nand an important aspect of that inquiry is the results achieved or avoided by the officials' \nactions. Id. at 279 n.24, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 n.24. Also important is the inevitability or \nforeseeability of the adverse impact. Id. at 279 n.25, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 n.25. But the Court \ncautioned, \"an inference is a working tool, not a synonym for proof.\" Id. In the case the \nCourt was considering, it conceded that an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn \nfrom the inevitability of the adverse impact on women of the statute in question, but the \nlegitimacy of the underlying legislative policy and the rest of the evidence mitigated that \ninference and prevented it, in the Court's analysis, from \"ripen[ing] into proof.\" Id. \nThese three cases lend further support to the guidelines to our inquiry found \nin Dayton and Columbus. The court is to focus clearly on the question of segregative intent. \nThe inevitability and foreseeability of racial imbalance resulting from official decisions is \nrelevant evidence to be weighed, but it is not probative without further examination of the \ncontext of, and other evidence concerning, the actions and decisions of the officials. \nInferences to be drawn from the effects of decisions must be supported by the other \nevidence, or there can be no finding of liability. Otherwise, the 628*628 court would be \nholding the state officials responsible for the consequences of their decisions, rather than \nholding them responsible only when the court is convinced that the decisions were at least \nin part motivated by an improper intent or purpose. This, the Supreme Court has made \nrepeatedly clear in recent years, would be improper. \nIV THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION \n\n \n \nThe Ninth Circuit, in remanding this case, explicitly disclaimed any intention to direct this \ncourt on how to balance the evidence in this case on the ultimate question of segregative \nintent. 612 F.2d at 416 n.2. Nor did the Court suggest that any of the findings of fact made \nby this court were inaccurate or erroneous. Rather, the Ninth Circuit's difficulty arose with \nthe manner in which this court articulated the process of weighing the evidence and drawing \na conclusion as to the existence of segregative intent. As this court reads the Circuit Court's \nopinion, it was concerned with the following aspects of this court's prior decision: 1) the acts \nand decisions by the school authorities as recounted by this court, 412 F.Supp. at 315-28, \nall either exacerbated or did nothing to improve the racial balance in the San Jose schools, \n612 F.2d at 414; 2) to mitigate whatever suggestion of intent arose from those actions, the \ndefendants appeared, from our recitation of the facts, to rely solely on the fact that their \ndecisions were based on the application of a racially neutral and consistently applied \nneighborhood school policy. Id. This court's decision could be read, and was read by the \nCircuit Court, to suggest that the district's racially neutral neighborhood school policy \n\"constituted either a complete defense to a charge of segregative intent, or, completely \ndispelled the inferences of segregative intent that flowed from the [plaintiffs'] proof.\" Id. at \n415. \nThe Ninth Circuit held that the simple invocation of a neighborhood school policy, without a \nmore complete analysis of its origins, its application, and the available alternatives, is not a \ndefense, in and of itself, to the inferences of segregative intent which arose from the \nplaintiffs' proof. Id. The district court's attention must remain focused on the ultimate factual \nissue: segregative purpose. How the invocation of a neighborhood school policy impacts on \nthat ultimate fact depends on a lot more than the simple fact of its existence. This is \nparticularly true because the fact of a neighborhood school policy does not, on its face, \nhave any impact on decisions such as the location and size of new schools, and the choice \nof old schools to close. Id. In fact, as the Circuit Court pointed out through its lengthy \nquotation from Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 20-21, 91 \nS.Ct. 1267, 1278-79, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), decisions on site location and size of schools \n(and, likewise, decisions on which schools to close), when combined with a neighborhood \nschool policy, will define the neighborhood and have reciprocal effects on the racial and \nethnic composition of other schools in the district. Moreover, these very choices have a \nprofound effect on the further developments of neighborhoods: the opening of a racially \nidentifiable school is likely to result in the further segregation of the housing patterns in the \nneighborhoods served by that school. \nFor all these reasons, the Circuit Court was concerned that this court's earlier opinion \nseemed too quick to accept the simple invocation of a neighborhood school policy as a \nready and sufficient explanation to dispel any inferences of segregative intent which arose \nfrom the consistent and foreseeable segregative results of virtually all the decisions and \nchoices made by school officials which were discussed in our initial decision. While one \njudge of the three-judge circuit panel felt that this court had demonstrated that it had \ncarefully weighed all the competing evidence before concluding that there was insufficient \nevidence of segregative intent, the majority felt that our apparent complete reliance on the \ndefense of the neighborhood school policy required that the case be sent back to this court \nfor a more complete weighing of the evidence in light of the majority's admonition that \n\"[s]trict adherence to a neighborhood policy is no more than circumstantial 629*629 evidence \n\n \n \nthat bears upon the existence or nonexistence of segregative intent. The existence of such \na policy is not enough to prove the absence of segregative intent.\" Id. 612 F.2d at 416. \nWith the guidance of the Supreme Court cases and the Ninth Circuit opinion in mind, the \ncourt now turns back to the evidence in this case. \nV FACTS \nThere is little quarrel with the findings of fact made by this court in its initial decision. The \nplaintiffs have stated that they \"have never quarreled with the vast majority of the Court's \nfindings of evidentiary facts.\" Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Judgment on Remand, \nfiled August 4, 1980, at 11. The defendants, while making suggestions for additional \nfindings of fact, have not disputed as clearly erroneous any of the findings of the initial \nopinion. Nor did the Court of Appeals suggest that its remand was based on any dispute \nover the findings of fact which this court made in its decision. On the contrary, the Court of \nAppeals felt that this court, given those facts, had not justified sufficiently either its \nunwillingness to draw an inference of segregative intent from those facts or its willingness to \ninfer a complete defense to any such inferences in the existence of a consistent and neutral \nneighborhood school policy. Therefore, this court is prepared to rely principally on the \norganization and factual findings of its initial decision. Some additional findings will be \nmade, but these are not in the nature of contradictory or radically new departures from the \ninitial decision. Rather, they are based on additional evidence, readily discoverable in the \nrecord of this case, which helps to fill in the picture of the school officials' actions in the \nmanner demanded by the Court of Appeals. \nThe findings of fact in this case, as set out in this court's initial opinion, found at 412 F.Supp. \n310, are hereby incorporated into this opinion, except as modified in the discussion which \nfollows. \nIn order to comply as completely as possible with the Circuit Court's instructions, the court \nwill discuss the evidence under the same categories as it did in its initial opinion and \nattempt to explain, to the satisfaction of the Court of Appeals, why the court does not feel \nthat the evidence, on balance, supports a finding of segregative intent by the school officials \nof the San Jose Unified School District. \nAs a preliminary matter, the court wishes to highlight certain general facts concerning this \ndistrict which are crucial to understanding the ultimate findings of this court. These facts are \nall found in our initial decision, but they bear emphasis by repetition here in light of the Ninth \nCircuit's concerns. \nThis district is long and narrow in shape, extending approximately 16 air miles in length and \nvarying in width from a maximum of four miles to a minimum of one and one-half air miles. \nThe evidence in this case did not indicate any manipulation of the boundaries of this district \nsuch as would raise suspicions that the demarcation of the district itself was designed to \nperpetuate segregation. The only changes made in the boundaries of the district since 1950 \nhave been the annexations in 1956 of the Sunol School District and the Almaden \n\n \n \nElementary School District. There is no evidence that these annexations had any \nsegregative purpose or effect. \nThe demographic developments since World War II have been such that most of the \nSpanish-surnamed persons live in the northern, downtown section of the district, and most \nof the Anglos live in the southern, suburban part of the district. Through no fault of the \nschool authorities or any other state officials, at least as far as the record of this case \ndemonstrates, one can now draw a line across the district, north of which the student \npopulation is 60.5% Spanish-surnamed, south of which only .07% is Spanish-surnamed. \n612 F.2d at 413. This demographic reality, combined with the shape of the district, severely \nlimits and complicates available remedies for segregation, unlike other cases, where the \ntwo populations are not separated by a number of attendance zones. See, e.g., Adams v. \nUnited States, 620 F.2d 1277, 1298-99 (8th Cir.), 630*630 cert. denied, 449 U.S. 826, 101 \nS.Ct. 88, 66 L.Ed.2d 29 (1980). \nFinally, there is little or no dispute that the vast majority of schools in the SJUSD are racially \nimbalanced. While there was some reluctance shown by the defendants at trial to define \nracial imbalance by a certain percentage figure, the parties talked throughout the trial about \nthose schools which were identified by the State of California under its guidelines as \nsubstantially imbalanced. That was defined as any school with a percentage of pupils of one \nor more ethnic groups which differed by more than 15 percentage points from the \npercentage of that racial or ethnic group in the total student population of the \ndistrict. See 412 F.Supp. at 314. In 1968, the state identified 41 out of 50 schools in the \nSJUSD as racially imbalanced, and there is no doubt that this concentration continued and \nintensified right through the time of the trial of this case. Id. There is also no question that \nthe district was well aware at least since 1964 that this substantial imbalance existed and \nwas getting worse. Id. at 315-16. \nA. Site Selection and School Construction \nAs already noted, the selection of sites, along with the choice of sites to eliminate, is a \ncrucial issue in this re-evaluation of the evidence. Not only is the selection of sites and the \nsize of schools not dictated by a neighborhood school policy in and of itself, but these \ndecisions can play a crucial role themselves in defining the nature and make-up of a \nneighborhood. \nAs we found in our earlier opinion, 412 F.Supp. at 316-17, since 1965 nine new schools \nhave been sited and constructed in the San Jose Unified School District. All of these \nschools opened racially imbalanced. While the district failed to consider the state guidelines \non evaluating attendance areas, the fact is that, absent a major reformation of the \nattendance patterns in the entire district and a complete abandonment of the concept of \nneighborhood schools, the formal consideration of the state guidelines would have had no \neffect on the selection of sites and the construction of these schools. \nVirtually all the increase in school age population over the past three decades has occurred \nin the southern section of the district. There has been a virtual explosion of new \n\n \n \nsubdivisions in these essentially suburban areas, with many new families, often with \nchildren, moving in. The overwhelming majority of these people are Anglos. \nThere is nothing constitutionally suspect about building new schools where there is a rapid \nincrease in school age population. While it is true that suspicions would be properly aroused \nif the district was closing schools that appeared to be becoming racially mixed and \nsimultaneously opening new schools farthest from the area where the majority group \nresides, Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 \nS.Ct. at 1278-79, there is no evidence of such manipulation in this case. Rather, the district \nsimply responded to the needs presented by the population growth. These new areas were \nso far from the downtown areas, and the new construction represented such a small \npercentage of the total facilities in the district, that the need for new schools did not present \na very good opportunity by itself to help integrate the district. There is no suggestion in the \nrecord of such readily available alternatives to the construction of these new schools in the \nnew areas of population growth that the failure to seize on those opportunities could be \nfairly characterized as demonstrating segregative intent. \nB. The Field Act Schools \nPerhaps the most disturbing evidence facing the court concerns the decisions made \nsurrounding the reconstruction of what are referred to as the \"Field Act\" schools. Sixteen \nschools were closed at the end of the 1971 school year because, under the Field Act, \nCal.Ed.Code § 15451 et seq. and § 15501 et seq., they were considered unsafe. See 412 \nF.Supp. at 317.[1] Most of 631*631 these schools were located in the downtown area of the \ndistrict, and, of particular interest to our considerations, some of these schools were located \ntowards the southern portion of the downtown area, close to attendance areas which had a \ngreater proportion of Anglo students. \nPerhaps the most disturbing decision which was made at that time was to rebuild on their \nold sites three schools, Washington, Gardner, and Wilson, despite a recommendation from \nthe Westinghouse Learning Corporation[2] to do otherwise, and despite the objections of a \nmember of the Board of Education (and its former President) Mrs. McCreath that such a \ndecision would perpetuate segregation unnecessarily. \nHowever, a number of pieces of evidence mitigate against an inference that this decision, \nas ill-advised as it might have been, was motivated by segregative intent. First, the principal \npressure which resulted in this decision seems to have been exerted by the local committee \nof the Building Master Plan Task Group in the Washington-Gardner-Wilson area, which was \nconcerned that it would lose its neighborhood schools.[3] Second, despite the specific \nrecommendation concerning these schools from the Westinghouse Learning Corporation \nstudy, the study also made it clear that real progress towards integration of the San Jose \nSchools could only be made through the use of two-way bussing. The shifting of attendance \nlines, and thereby reshuffling a few students who lived near the center of the district, would \nnot make much difference. Therefore, Dr. Charles Knight, the Superintendent of the \nSJUSD, testified that the district chose to follow a rebuilding program \"that would not get in \nthe way of a two-way exchange of students.\" Reporter's Transcript at 611. Third, the Board \n\n \n \ndid, finally, move to transfer a section of the Washington attendance area, known as the \nLittle Orchard section, to the River Glen attendance area. The Little Orchard area is almost \n100% Spanish-surnamed Americans, and it is slightly closer to the River Glen than to the \nWashington school. There was some evidence at trial that the Board refused to make the \ntransfer for a long time because of pressure from those already residing in the River Glen \nattendance area. The fact that the Board did voluntarily make the transfer, despite the \nresistance, can only help dispel any inference that the Board acted with a segregative \npurpose in mind. Finally, the Board ultimately decided not to rebuild the Wilson Junior High \nSchool, which was the most heavily segregated Junior High in the district.[4] Plaintiffs tried to \nargue that this 632*632 decision is evidence of segregative intent. The court, however, as \ndiscussed infra, p. ___, thinks this decision also serves to help dispel any inference of \nsegregative intent arising from the school officials' other actions. \nThe school district also chose to house students in temporary portable classrooms on the \nsites of the Field Act schools while the buildings were being reconstructed, rather than \nmake any attempt to disperse them to other schools in the district in a manner which might \nhave improved racial balance. However, while a few schools in the district had some excess \ncapacity, most schools were operating at or over capacity, or were operating so close to \ncapacity that it would not have been practical to attempt to fit a few more students into the \navailable slots. Certainly, to make those transfers and disrupt the attendance patterns of \nstudents—moving them out of their community, separating friends, throwing children into a \nnew environment from which they will then be removed in a year or two — for just the \ninterim period of construction does not appear to this court to be so compelling an option \nthat an inference of segregative intent should be drawn from the failure to seize the \nopportunity. \nThe evidence did show a very few instances where the undercapacity of a heavily Anglo \nschool was sufficient and the school was close enough to a heavily Spanish-surname \nschool that a transfer could have been accomplished even within a concept of \nneighborhood schools. Those instances are few in number and there was no evidence that \nthe school officials affirmatively considered and rejected these alterations in the attendance \npatterns. At best, the evidence indicates that the school officials did not make as great an \neffort as possible to identify and seize on every available instance where a transfer of \nstudents to a nearby school operating at slightly under capacity would have improved ethnic \nbalance. Under these circumstances, and in the context of the rest of the evidence in this \ncase, this court does not think it proper to infer from this failure to seize on opportunities to \nintegrate proof of an intent to segregate. \nC. School Closures \nSchool closures, like the selection of new schools, can play an important role in helping the \ncourts identify a segregative purpose of a school district which claims to operate under a \nneutral neighborhood school policy. The decision to close certain schools and disperse their \nstudents to some schools and not others can provide evidence that the attendance areas of \nthe neighborhood school policy were delineated in a manner designed to continue racial \nseparation. Taylor v. Board of Education of City School District of New Rochelle, 191 \n\n \n \nF.Supp. 181, 195 (S.D.N.Y.), affirmed, 294 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 940, 82 \nS.Ct. 382, 7 L.Ed.2d 339 (1961). This is the type of evidence with which the Ninth Circuit \nwas particularly concerned in sending this case back to this court. \nThe evidence surrounding school closings in this case, however, considering all the \ncircumstances, does not support a finding of segregative intent. Declining enrollment in the \nnorthern part of the district led to a couple of instances where schools were closed and the \nattendance area combined with contiguous areas. In each instance, the students of the \nclosed school ended up in a new school which was less imbalanced than their old school. \nSince most of the schools in the northern area are imbalanced to begin with, the reciprocal \neffect of these consolidations was that the receiving school became more heavily \nimbalanced. The plaintiffs do not seem to dispute that, if the school district only considered \nconsolidation with contiguous areas, it did the best job it could. However, plaintiffs contend \nthat the failure to consider alternatives, such as bussing students to schools in the southern \nend of the district, provides evidence of segregative intent. Plaintiffs' counsel, in fact, \nrepeatedly referred to the consolidation of attendance districts in the northern end of the \ndistrict as the \"downtown shuffle.\" \nHowever, the court must look at this evidence while bearing in mind that it \ncannot 633*633 judge the district's actions against a duty to integrate the schools. Johnson \nv. San Francisco Unified School District, 500 F.2d 349, 351 (9th Cir. 1974); Soria v. Oxnard \nSchool District Board of Trustees, 488 F.2d 579, 587 (9th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. \n951, 94 S.Ct. 1961, 40 L.Ed.2d 301 (1974). While the decision to continue to draw \nattendance areas which were contiguous and which approximated as closely as possible \nthe concept of a neighborhood school had the foreseeable effect of continuing the \nimbalance in the schools, the decision not to depart from the neighborhood school policy in \norder to bus students a great distance to the already overcrowded southern schools, on \ndouble sessions, cannot be attributed to segregative intent. The perfectly sound educational \nreasons for preserving a true neighborhood school policy, the district's desire to push \nforward with decentralization, and the fact that the district chose, in each instance, the \nredistribution of the students to contiguous areas resulting in the most beneficial effect in \nterms of racial balance for the students being reassigned, all counter any inference of \nsegregative intent which might arise from the foreseeable effect of the refusal to bus. The \nresult may have been continued segregation, but the court does not feel that the balance of \nevidence on this point suggests that the district acted with an unconstitutional purpose. \nNor is there any evidence that the choice of schools to close was motivated by any \nsegregative intent. In fact, the decision to close the Wilson school and disperse its students \nto three neighboring schools seems to have been motivated, at least in part, by a desire to \neliminate the most heavily segregated Junior High School. The change resulted in an \nimprovement of the racial balance for all the former students of Wilson. Moreover, the \ntransfer of some of those Wilson students to the Markham Junior High School resulted in a \nmarked improvement in the racial balance of that school, which went from 7.2% Spanish-\nsurnamed to 18.4% Spanish-surnamed. From the perspective of the other schools involved \nin the change, the already existing imbalance was made worse. But the school officials' \nwillingness to make changes like these, which result in some mitigation of the segregation \n\n \n \nfor some pupils, counters any inference arising from other evidence that the officials' actions \nwere generally motivated by a discriminatory purpose. \nSimilarly, the decision to close the Bascom school was necessary, since the school was \nlocated on land belonging to the City College, which wanted the site back by 1973. The \ncombination of that attendance area with Trace resulted in the best possible improvement in \nethnic balance for the students from Bascom. \nThe Belden site was turned over to the continuing education high school for the perfectly \nrational reason that it was located in an industrial area and so was conveniently situated for \nprograms involving on-site training. College Park was closed because of problems caused \nby the close proximity of the municipal airport, and Jefferson was closed as one of the \nunsafe, pre-Field Act schools. These schools were reasonably combined with the Bachrodt \nschool, because 1) it had the largest site, 2) this area was historically served by one school \nbefore the population increase had forced the division of the area, and 3) College Park was \nseparated from Hester by railroad tracks, which would have increased the need for \ntransportation for safety reasons. \nLongfellow and Roosevelt were also closed because they had been built prior to the Field \nAct and were considered unsafe. Neither school was rebuilt.[5] Both schools were heavily \nimbalanced technically. The students were reassigned to schools, Hester and Burnett (and \nSan Jose High School, see infra, pp. 634-635), respectively, which resulted in an \nimprovement of the racial balance from the perspective of the students who had formerly \nattended the closed school. \n634*634 These choices, therefore, do not seem to support an inference of segregative intent. \nIt is true that the district did decide against a major reformulation of the attendance patterns \nby instituting bussing to schools further south. In each of these instances of closing, there is \nno doubt that the possibility for instituting such a plan was brought to the school officials' \nattention by a group or individual. However, the refusal to abandon a neighborhood school \npolicy, without more, in order to integrate cannot be the basis for inferring segregative \nintent; otherwise, we would in effect be imposing a duty to integrate on school districts \nwhose segregation is attributable to residential segregation unrelated to the actions of \nschool and other state officials. That we are forbidden to do. See Brody-Jones v. \nMacchiarola, 503 F.Supp. 1185, 1248 (E.D.N.Y.1979) (No duty to desegregate schools \nwhose imbalance was caused by other factors, such as demographic trends, unrelated to \nactions of the school district); see also infra, pp. 642-644. \nWith the decision to close the Wilson and Roosevelt Junior High Schools permanently came \na restructuring of the grades of the downtown junior high schools and high schools. \nFormerly, all junior high schools in the SJUSD were three year schools, and all high schools \nwere also three year schools. However, the school board decided to restructure the schools \nso that the downtown junior high schools — Burnett and Hoover — became two year \nschools, and the downtown high schools — Lincoln and San Jose — became four year \nschools. The junior high schools and high schools in the rest of the district remained on the \nold 3-3 plan. See 412 F.Supp. at 321. \n\n \n \nTwo aspects of these changes resulting from the decision to close, and not rebuild, Wilson \nand Roosevelt are particularly disturbing. First, the restructuring decisions resulted in two \ndifferent feeder systems, one for the area which was predominantly Spanish-surnamed, and \none for the area which was predominantly Anglo. Certainly, the use of different feeder \npatterns for schools dominated by different racial or ethnic groups could form the basis for a \nfinding of segregative intent, for it could provide evidence that feeder patterns were being \nmanipulated for the purpose of channeling the two groups into different high schools. See, \ne. g., Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580 (1st Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 963, 95 S.Ct. \n1950, 44 L.Ed.2d 449 (1975). Second, the transfer of students resulted in Hoover Junior \nHigh School transforming from one of the district's few racially balanced schools to an \nimbalanced school. See 412 F.Supp. at 321-22. \nHowever, unlike the evidence of the manipulation of the feeder patterns in Morgan v. \nKerrigan, supra, these changes do not appear to this court to be designed to channel racial \nor ethnic groups apart. As already noted, the changes resulted in a better ethnic balance \nfrom the point of view of the students being transferred from the closed schools. Moreover, \npart of these series of changes included the transfer of some students to the Markham \nJunior High School, which made that school racially balanced. Finally, the changes in \nstructure are not part of a pattern of manipulations and affirmative actions which could only \nbe explained, in toto, as motivated by segregative intent. The court is convinced, on the \nbasis of all the evidence, that this restructuring was simply the only alternative that the \nschool officials saw to a major restructuring of the attendance patterns of the district. These \nchanges allowed them to preserve the concept of neighborhood schools, which is not in and \nof itself constitutionally suspect. See infra., pp. 642-644. And since the evidence does not \nunambiguously point towards a further separation of the ethnic groups, but rather shows, \nfrom some perspectives and for some students, an improvement in the racial balance of the \nschools they attended, the court is not prepared to find that any inference of discriminatory \npurpose which might arise from this one differentiation in the feeder patterns of the northern \nand southern schools and from the resulting imbalance at the Hoover school rises to the \nlevel of proof of segregative intent, either by itself or combined with the rest of the evidence \nin 635*635 this case. Too many pieces of evidence point the other way for this court to draw \nthat conclusion from those which point towards such an inference. \nD. Portables and Double Sessions \nAs our earlier decision noted, 412 F.Supp. at 322-23, the school district uses portables \nextensively throughout the district. A number of schools in the north were, at the time of \ntrial, made up exclusively of portable classrooms; portables were used to construct schools \non the sites of Field Act schools after the old buildings were condemned and while new \nbuildings were being constructed. In the south, the rapidly growing population forced the \nextensive use of portables to relieve overcrowding until new facilities could be built. (The \nproblem in the southern end of the district was, of course, exacerbated by the repeated \nfailure of bond issues on the ballot during the years from 1969 right up through the time of \nthe trial on this matter, which prevented needed construction of new schools.) Moreover, \ntestimony at trial indicated that the Board of Trustees of SJUSD, in planning a new school, \nbuilds the school with a capacity under the estimated maximum number of students who will \n\n \n \nbe using the facility during its lifetime, in order to avoid having a great deal of excess space \nwhen enrollment is below peak. Therefore, the need for the use of some portables — at the \ntime of peak enrollment — is automatically planned into construction decisions. \nIt is true, as noted in our initial decision, 412 F.Supp. at 322, that the school district has \nnever used portables to increase integration. This, of course, was always an alternative \navailable when a need for portables arose; the school district could always have opted to \nplace new portables at the other end of the district from the area of overcrowding, and then \nbus the students to that end of town. But to suggest that the failure to take that extreme \naction indicates segregative intent seems unreasonable to this court. Because the need for \nportables at a particular location at either end of town was considered temporary — in the \nnorth until the new Field Act schools were constructed, in the south until bond issues were \npassed by the voters to build new schools to handle the growth in population — any \nintegration based on the use of portables would be temporary at best. Moreover, courts \nhave acknowledged that efforts to maintain the concept of neighborhood schools is a \nperfectly reasonable educational choice, as long as it does not operate as a mask for a \ndesire to maintain segregation. United States v. Texas Education Agency, 564 F.2d 162, \n168-70 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied sub nom., Austin Independent School District v. United \nStates, 443 U.S. 915, 99 S.Ct. 3106, 61 L.Ed.2d 879 (1979); Smiley v. Vollert, 453 F.Supp. \n463, 481 (S.D.Tex.1978); see infra., pp. 642-644. In this instance, the decision to maintain \nneighborhood schools while new schools were being built, rather than sending the students \ntemporarily across town, for distances which would have to be, for the most part, fairly \nsubstantial, seems to this court to be perfectly explicable for racially neutral reasons, and \ndoes not provide sufficient grounds for inferring proof of segregative intent. \nThe continued use of double sessions is more troubling, because it is acknowledged that \ndouble sessions are educationally disadvantageous. Therefore, the fact that bussing \nstudents a long distance is also considered by many to be educationally disadvantageous \ncarries less weight as an explanation when the alternative is also so considered. \nHowever, the evidence does not, on balance, indicate that the problem of double sessions \ncould have been alleviated to any great extent by bussing students from the southern to the \nnorthern schools. While some of the northern schools were operating at undercapacity, for \nthe most part they were not operating very far under capacity, and few students could have \nbeen transferred without causing the northern schools to go also on double sessions. \nMoreover, some of the figures concerning undercapacity masked the reality that all the \navailable space was being utilized in the northern 636*636 schools. For instance, there was \ntestimony at trial from Dr. Knight that the compensatory education programs which were \navailable for students in many of the downtown schools provided for lower student-to-\nteacher ratios and also provided for additional support personnel, who needed to use some \nof the space for their work. Reporter's Transcript at 1338-39. \nAgain, the need for double sessions was perceived by school officials to be a temporary \nsituation, until new schools could be built. These new schools would be built where the \nstudents lived, in line with the neighborhood school policy. Therefore, any alleviation of \nsegregation which would come from sending the students to northern schools would have \nbeen temporary. It would have resulted, moreover, in simply spreading the double session \n\n \n \nproblem throughout the district, thereby increasing the number of students adversely \naffected by this unfortunate situation. Under these circumstances, the decision not to bus \nthe students already on double session to northern schools, while clearly having the \nforeseeable effect of bypassing another opportunity to increase integration, at least \ntemporarily, does not provide a basis for inferring proof of segregative intent from the \nactions of the school officials. \nE. Transportation \nThe court's basic findings and conclusions on this issue remain virtually the same from \nthose made in its initial decision. See 412 F.Supp. at 324, 332. There was evidence \nintroduced at trial that there is a great deal of bussing used in the SJUSD, both in terms of \nthe number of students being transported (approximately one-third of the student \npopulation) and in terms of the money expended (over $850,000 per year). However, \nexcept for transportation to special schools and programs, there was no evidence that there \nis or has ever been any bussing outside of the attendance areas, which have not been \nshown to have been established or gerrymandered in any way that suggests segregative \nintent. Nor was there any evidence introduced showing that students could have been \nbussed equivalent distances to a more integrative setting. \nThe school officials readily admitted that bussing was necessary even within the \nneighborhood school concept. Besides the obvious need for transportation over relatively \nshort distances for safety reasons, and the need for transportation of students who attend \nspecial schools, the natural fluctuations in the concentration of school age population in one \narea or another will always necessitate some deviation from the ideal of students always \nliving within walking distance of their schools. Particularly when the school age population is \nrelatively sparse, the necessity that schools be at least a certain size in order to justify \nneeded facilities and programs means that attendance areas must, at times, be so large \nthat some, even a great number of students, will have to be transported to the school. \nThere is no evidence in the record, however, suggesting that the school officials in the \nSJUSD did not strive for the best approximation of the \"walking distance\" ideal, or that they \nmanipulated the use of bussing in one area or another for discriminatory purposes. The \nbussing in the south was readily attributable to the larger attendance areas which existed as \nthe population there first began to move in, and was unfortunately prolonged by the \nrepeated failure of the school district to receive the authorization from the voters to build \nmore schools. These would have presumably eliminated a great deal of the bussing in the \nsouthern part of the district. In the north, the principal bussing was attributable to the \nconsolidation of districts as the need for some schools had been eliminated. Nor was there \nany evidence offered which suggested that the distances from school ever became so great \nthat the underlying benefits deriving from a neighborhood school policy and the \ndecentralization it allows — other than the ability to walk to school — were ever threatened \nor eliminated. \n637*637 The visuals attached to the affidavit of Roy B. Bursch, filed December 17, \n1971,[6] provide a good representation of how changes in population allow for the shrinking \n\n \n \nof attendance areas and the elimination of the need for transportation. Visual number three \nin particular shows how the growth in population in the downtown area during the 1950s \nallowed the College Park-Jefferson-Grant attendance areas to be subdivided. In more \nrecent years, the reversal of that population trend has reversed the trend in schools, so that \nmuch of that population is now once again served by one school, Bachrodt, which covers a \nlarge area and therefore necessitates the use of buses to transport students. The response \nto these trends by the school district has been neutral and even-handed, and there has \nbeen no evidence introduced which suggests that any actions in this area have been \nmotivated by segregative intent. Absent evidence that similar amounts and distances of \ntransportation could have been used to alleviate racial imbalance, the court sees no basis \nfor inferring segregative intent from the use of bussing by the school district within the \ncontext of the neighborhood school policy. \nOne other aspect of the transportation issue leaps out at anyone examining the record in \nthis matter. As noted in our earlier opinion, 412 F.Supp. at 324, the evidence indicates that \nDr. Knight, the Westinghouse Learning Corporation, and the Building Task Force all \nconcluded that the only realistic solution to the segregation in the SJUSD would be some \nform of two-way bussing. There is evidence that the Board of Trustees and all other school \nofficials recognized that, ultimately, the school district could not be integrated without \nbussing. Yet the Board has repeatedly made it clear that it is opposed to bussing for the \npurpose of integration. Plaintiffs' counsel, at the trial, repeatedly returned to this argument \nand ultimately appeared to consider this evidence the most compelling of their case: in the \nface of the knowledge that the SJUSD would be desegregated only with some form of two-\nway bussing, the Board of Trustees consistently refused to consider any proposal for \nbussing and repeatedly went on record as publicly opposed to large-scale bussing for the \npurpose of integration. \nIt may well be that the Board hoped that some other solution to the problem of integration \ncould be found, short of large-scale bussing, which it properly recognized would meet \nresistance from the community, both Anglo and Spanish-surnamed. There is also some \nevidence that the Board, in its various pronouncements throughout the years, did not mean \nto rule out the possibility of some bussing in connection with a plan for integration. Rather, \nthe statements suggest that the Board promised the community that there would not be any \nchange in the traditional methods of school assignments without plenty of notice to the \ncommunity and plenty of opportunity for input into the process by citizens of the SJUSD. \nNonetheless, this apparent resistance to bussing is particularly disturbing in light of the \nBoard's refusal to institute other suggestions throughout the years which would have had \nsome effect on the pattern of racial imbalance. Suggestions for magnet schools, education \nparks, open enrollment, and voluntary bussing have received, at best, cursory consideration \nfrom the school board. In each instance, however, there were perfectly reasonable and \nrational explanations for the decision not to adopt the proposal. \nAccordingly, on this record the court does not see sufficient evidence to justify a finding of \nsegregative intent simply from the refusal of the school officials to adopt any 638*638 of the \nproffered alternatives, including bussing, to the neighborhood school policy. The incidents \nare relatively few in number, there are reasonable explanations, other than segregative \n\n \n \npurpose, for them, and there are other actions and statements by the Board which show \nsome concern with and attempts to alleviate segregation. While the district has clearly \ngotten cold feet on a number of occasions and has failed to follow through on its claimed \ngoal of desegregating the district, it is, of course, under no constitutional duty to do so. The \ncourt is convinced that the desire often expressed is real, even if there has been some \nreluctance in the execution. This evaluation, combined with those actions which have \nhelped, to some small degree, to alleviate some of the worst imbalances, convinces this \ncourt that the foreseeable maintenance of segregation which resulted from other actions \nand refusals to act by the school board does not support, in this instance, an inference of \nsegregative purpose. The refusal to date to consider bussing, despite a recognition that it is \nprobably the only solution to the problem of racial imbalance in the SJUSD, is the most \ndamning of the evidence against the school district, but it is not sufficient, in the context of \nthe rest of the evidence in this case, to support a finding of liability. \nF. Bond Issue Elections \nThe major point concerning the bond elections which plaintiffs pressed at trial and our initial \nfindings highlighted, 412 F.Supp. at 324-25, is that various public comments by the school \nboard in connection with the effort to get the growth issues passed in the years 1971 \nthrough 1973 offered 1) the carrot that the bond money would not be used to subsidize \nbussing (and reiterated the Board's own continued disinclination to use bussing for \nintegration purposes) and 2) the stick that failure to pass the bond issue would result in (a) \nalterations in the neighborhood school policy to spread double sessions throughout the \ndistrict and (b) the need to send students from the northern end of the district to the south, \nand/or vice versa. It is of course interesting to note that despite these so-called threats and \npromises made in connection with the bond elections, allegedly designed to appeal to \npeople's segregative inclinations, none of the bond issues in connection with which these \nstatements were made were passed by the voters. \nOne factual finding made in our initial decision, 412 F.Supp. at 332, needs to be clarified. \nThe bond issue passed in 1969 for the rebuilding of the Field Act schools contained a \nprovision which stated that the funds raised by the bonds would not be used to purchase \nnew sites. However, it did not, in fact, require that the schools be built on the same sites: old \nsites could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a new site. Presumably, in fact, \nfunds raised by such a sale could also be supplemented by money from other sources to \npay for the purchase of a new site. Building the Field Act schools in different locations might \nhave been made more difficult by this provision in the bond issue, but it did not require that \nthe same sites be used. Therefore, there is little basis for drawing any inference of \nsegregative intent from the wording of the bond issue, since it did not close the door to the \nreconsideration of the location of the Field Act schools. Moreover, as the court stated in the \nfirst decision, 412 F.Supp. at 332, since we find that the actual decision to rebuild most of \nthe Field Act schools on site does not support a finding of segregative intent in the context \nof the other evidence in this case, this language in the bond issue, which did not even \nrequire that the schools be built on site, does not provide any stronger basis for an \ninference of segregative intent. \n\n \n \nThe court also reiterates its earlier findings, 412 F.Supp. at 332, concerning the Board's \nstatements issued in connection with the bond issue campaigns. The court has re-examined \nthose materials carefully. The statements concerning the spread of double sessions and the \nneed to transport students to the other end of the district if the various issues did not pass \nseem, in context, to be simply realistic factual statements of the results which would flow \nfrom 639*639 the failure of the bond issues to pass. These statements are just some, among \nothers, made in the literature concerning the possible repercussions of the failure of the \nbond issues. There is no particular emphasis given to them, nor, in context, is there any \nsuggestion that the school board meant to do anything but point to the many burdens which \nwould be placed on the students and the district in general by such a failure of the bond \nissue to pass. \nThe repeated assurances that the bond money would not be used to finance bussing also \nfail, in this court's judgment, to support a finding of segregative intent. If the school district \nultimately decided to adopt some sort of bussing plan, there was no evidence that the funds \nfrom these bond issues would be needed to finance such a plan. Certainly if there is no \naffirmative constitutional obligation to integrate, there is no such obligation to bus to \nintegrate. And there is even more certainly no constitutional infirmity in promising not to use \nparticular funds for that purpose. If that is the case, it would seem highly improper to put \nmuch weight on the fact that the district made such a promise in this instance. Again, in a \nstronger case, such a promise might add secondary support for a finding of unconstitutional \nintent based on conduct from which such an inference could be more confidently drawn. In \nthe context of this case, where the rest of the evidence of the district's actions, in the \ncontext in which they occurred, do not provide a strong basis for an inference of \ndiscriminatory purpose, the fact that it promised not to use these particular funds for bussing \ndoes not add much weight in favor of that inference. \nG. Quest \nAs the findings in our initial decision stated, 412 F.Supp. at 325, the school board \nestablished QUEST (Quality Urban Education Study Team) in 1969 to formulate proposals \nto desegregate the schools of the SJUSD. While the Board did not ultimately adopt any of \nQUEST's proposals, our initial findings concerning the school board's relationship with \nQUEST requires further elaboration. For instance, there is evidence on the record that the \nBoard itself did issue statements indicating that it did not favor mass bussing, and there are \nsome indications that school officials encouraged QUEST not to make any proposals which \nmight be inflammatory immediately prior to the bond elections. However, prior to the \n\"opening up\" of the QUEST membership, there is no evidence that the Board attempted to \ndirect the findings of QUEST or to otherwise interfere with its operations. To the contrary, \nthe evidence indicates that school officials did their utmost to ensure, when QUEST was \norganized and began its work, that articulate, concerned representatives of all segments of \nthe community were involved, and to ensure that those involved in QUEST desired to \ndevelop proposals to integrate the school system, not to sabotage the effort. This evidence \nhelps, in fact, to counter other evidence from other actions which might raise an inference \nthat the Board acted with segregative intent. \n\n \n \nUnder pressure from members of the community who feared the outcome of QUEST's \nwork, the Board did agree to open up QUEST to more people, and did so at a meeting \nattended mostly by people opposed to the work of QUEST. However, the evidence also \nindicates that the Board made subsequent efforts to recruit more people from other, more \nsupportive segments of the community to join in the effort and to presumably counter-\nbalance the influx of people hostile to QUEST's mission. Even the former chairman of \nQUEST testified that he favored the general notion of opening up QUEST to a broader \nmembership, but objected to the manner in which the Board did it and the circumstances in \nwhich it acted. The Board's action did result in a disruption and delay of the work of QUEST, \nas the new people were integrated into the work of the various subcommittees (which also \nhad to be expanded in number to accommodate all the new people) and were educated in \nthe previous work of QUEST. It must be noted, however, that despite the time and manner \nin which the 640*640 membership of QUEST was re-opened, the final report of the \nreconstituted QUEST did recommend a plan for integrating the schools, which included the \nuse of magnet schools, open enrollment, and voluntary bussing. The minority report also \nrecommended integration, through the use of educational parks. \nWhile the Board does seem to have, at certain points, succumbed to pressure from persons \nhostile to the work of QUEST, the overall picture presented suggests that the Board's initial \norganization of QUEST, and the efforts both then and at the later point of reconstitution to \nensure that the community was well represented and that persons sympathetic to the work \nof QUEST were in the positions of leadership in both the original and reconstituted \norganization, does not support an inference of discriminatory purpose in the Board's \nrelationship to QUEST. And while the Board did modify its charge to QUEST, down-grading \nintegration from the \"primary objective\" to a \"long term ... priority,\" the court does not see \nthis essentially political move as particularly decisive, either for the work of QUEST or for \nthe likelihood of integration or continued segregation in the SJUSD. Under these \ncircumstances, this example of the Board's concession to those hostile to the work of \nQUEST does not support a finding of segregative intent. \nIndeed, the Board's persistence in seeing the work of QUEST go forward, in attempting to \nprotect it from being overwhelmed by those hostile to its work, and in continuing, despite \npressure, to encourage QUEST to formulate proposals for the integration of the district — \neven if for the long term — seems to the court to support a finding that the Board was trying \nits best, in a difficult situation, to continue to move forward towards some affirmative effort to \nintegrate. The fact that it seems to have not followed through ultimately on that effort, by not \nacting on QUEST's proposals, may mean that it has abandoned this affirmative effort to \nintegrate. But its efforts certainly do not, therefore, become the basis for inferring an intent \nto segregate. To make such an inference would be to warn all school districts which have \nracially imbalanced schools not to make any affirmative moves towards integration unless \nthey are certain that they will succeed; otherwise, the effort will become the basis for an \ninference of discriminatory purpose on their part, rather than an inference of the very \nopposite intent which in fact motivated them. Not only would this be the wrong position for \nthe courts to take as a matter of policy but, as long as there is a distinction in the law \nbetween de facto and de jure segregation, such an approach would seem altogether \nimproper. \n\n \n \nH. Faculty and Staff Assignment \nUnder the law, school districts may not assign staff and faculty to certain schools on the \nbasis of race or ethnicity. See United States v. Montgomery County Board of \nEducation, 395 U.S. 225, 89 S.Ct. 1670, 23 L.Ed.2d 263 (1969), and other cases cited for \nthis point in our initial opinion, 412 F.Supp. at 333. A discriminatory pattern of assignment of \nfaculty and staff \"[is] among the most important indicia of a segregated school \nsystem.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 18, 91 \nS.Ct. at 1277; Adams v. United States, supra, 620 F.2d at 1290; Arthur v. Nyquist, 573 F.2d \n134, 144 (2d Cir. 1978); United States v. State of Texas, 498 F.Supp. 1356, 1372 \n(E.D.Tex.1980). The courts have made it clear that benign motivations behind the decision \nto assign faculty and staff on the basis of race does not mitigate the fact that the \nassignment has been made on an unconstitutional basis. \nOfficials of the school system admitted at trial that Spanish-surnamed teachers were \nassigned to predominantly Spanish-surname schools for educational purposes. These \npurposes basically amounted to providing role models for the students and making available \nSpanish-speaking teachers. As noted, the court does not believe that the law allows \nassignment on the basis of race even if motivated by the former purpose. The court \nbelieves that the latter purpose might have been 641*641 proper if there was evidence that \nthe district simply attempted to assign Spanish-speaking faculty and staff to schools with a \nhigh percentage of Spanish-speaking students and that such a policy resulted naturally in \nthe assignment of a disproportionate number of Spanish-surnamed teachers and staff to \nschools with a disproportionate number of Spanish-surnamed students. As our initial \nfindings of fact reflected, 412 F.Supp. at 333, however, there was no evidence introduced \nshowing that the district investigated the need for Spanish-speaking teachers at those \nschools, or made any attempt to identify teachers or staff who spoke Spanish — who were \neither Anglo or Spanish-surnamed — for the purpose of assigning them to those schools. \nTherefore, the court cannot conclude that the disproportionate assignment of Spanish-\nsurnamed teachers and staff to those schools resulted from that racially neutral policy. \nHowever, this court is concerned, in the context of this suit, only with any effect that this \nassignment policy had on the segregation of the student population of the schools. Such an \neffect could result from the racial identifiability of the school caused, at least in part, by the \nmake-up of the faculty and staff. Adams v. United States, supra, 620 F.2d at 1290. Despite \nthe grossly disproportionate percentages of Spanish-surnamed faculty and staff assigned to \npredominately Spanish-surname schools, see 412 F.Supp. at 325, the small number of \nSpanish-surnamed teachers and staff in the SJUSD means that no school has a large \npercentage of Spanish-surnamed faculty and staff. As this court previously found, id., one \nschool had a faculty that reached 26 percent Spanish-surnamed at one time, and another \nhad a 24 percent Spanish-surnamed faculty. Otherwise, the percentage remained below 15 \npercent in any one school. These percentages are too low, in the court's opinion, to cause a \nschool to have become ethnically identifiable because of the policy of assignment of faculty \nand staff. Whatever the discriminatory nature of the assignment policy, therefore, this court \nsees no basis for concluding that the assignment policy affected the racial imbalance of the \nstudent population of the schools. Moreover, the benign purposes which lay behind the \n\n \n \ndistrict's policy does convince the court that we should not use the assignment policy as \nsupport for inferring segregative intent from any of the school officials' other acts which had \nthe foreseeable effect of perpetuating racial imbalance in the schools. \nI. Board Policy and State Statutory Requirements \nThe court stands by its earlier findings and conclusions as to the Board's policy and the \nstate statutory requirements vis-a-vis integration, 412 F.Supp. at 326-28, 333-34, and we \nwill simply elaborate on those findings and conclusions. The court feels that the Board's oft-\nrepeated commitment to integration can only weigh in the district's favor and against an \ninference of segregative intent. The repeated statement of this policy does, of course, make \nit undoubtedly clear that the school officials were well aware of the continuing existence of \nsevere ethnic imbalance in their schools; but even without those statements, there is no \nway that the Board of Trustees and all other high officials of the school district could not \nhave been well aware of the situation. And it is true that the Board ultimately did little to \nimplement its stated commitment to integration. But under the circumstances of this case, \nwhere there never was an affirmative duty to integrate, the fact that the Board was \nrepeatedly willing to commit itself on paper to looking for a solution to the problem of \nimbalance should not be turned on its head and used to support an inference of segregative \nintent. If the actions taken by the Board do not themselves form the basis for such a finding, \nthe court does not see how the Board's willingness to state openly that its object and \npurpose is to promote integration provides the missing foundation for such an inference. \nThe Board should at least be given credit for its willingness to stick by this position, even if \njust rhetorically, despite the apparent opposition among many residents of the district to any \nsuch effort. At worst, the statements 642*642 carry no weight one way or the other. The \ncourt, however, feels they are worth something more than that. The statements, combined \nwith the persistent attempts to encourage the development of some proposal which would \nincrease ethnic balance in the district's schools, however limited and however often the \nBoard ultimately failed to follow through on the resulting proposals, do help, to some \ndegree, to offset some of the other evidence which, it could be argued, suggests an \ninference of segregative intent. \nAs to the effects of the existing state policies, statutes and guidelines, it is important to keep \nin mind that this action does not include any pendant state claims or any direct allegations \nof violation of state law. The record repeatedly reflects that fact that the plaintiffs raised the \narguments concerning state law only in so far as the alleged failure to follow the guidelines \nand policies might support an inference of segregative intent under the standards of federal \nlaw. \nIn this context, the court reiterates the key findings on this issue made in its earlier opinion, \n412 F.Supp. at 327-28, 334. While the state generally had some policy to encourage efforts \nto integrate imbalanced schools from 1962 until 1972, the specifics of that policy and the \nextent of the district's obligations did vary a great deal over that period. Therefore there is \nno basis for inferring segregative intent from the Board's failure to act in any specific \nmanner. It is true that the Board responded to the state's continuing exhortations to \nintegrate with references to the opportunity provided by the rebuilding of the Field Act \n\n \n \nschools and to the effort represented by the formation of QUEST, neither of which the \nBoard in the end took advantage of to make much progress toward integration. Nor did the \ndistrict take advantage of resources, such as those provided by the state's Bureau of \nIntergroup Relations, which would have assisted with the process of integration. \nBut again, these facts must be looked at in the context of the duty under federal law, which \nis the duty not to act with segregative intent. The court has herein found that the district's \nvarious substantive decisions do not support, in the context of all the evidence in this case, \nan overall conclusion that the school officials operated with an intent to segregate. We have \nalso held that the district's failure to follow through on the few efforts it began towards \nfinding a solution to the problem of ethnic imbalance in its schools does not support an \ninference of segregative intent; rather, to some extent they help mitigate evidence \nsupporting an inference of segregative intent. The court likewise does not see how the \ndistrict's failed attempts to comply with state policy and guidelines support such an \ninference. Again, those few attempts should be weighed in the district's favor; the fact that it \nultimately did not actually decrease the imbalance in its schools during this period does not \nchange the fact that the attempts provide evidence in the defendants' favor on the question \nof their intentions and purposes, especially given that under federal law there is no duty to \nintegrate, simply a duty not to segregate purposely. \nJ. Neighborhood School Policy \nOn remand, the examination of the SJUSD's neighborhood school policy remains central to \nthe issues faced by this court. The Ninth Circuit stated that the invocation of a neighborhood \nschool policy is not a defense, in and of itself, to a series of factual conclusions which \nsupport an inference of segregative intent. 612 F.2d at 415. The issue to be decided by this \ncourt, after looking at all the facts on the record, is whether or not it is proper to make an \ninference that segregative intent lay behind the actions of the Board of Trustees of the \nSJUSD when it took the various actions which knowingly perpetuated ethnic imbalance in \nthe schools. But this issue cannot be decided without an evaluation of the district's \nneighborhood school policy, for most of the decisions made by the Board were explained in \nthis action by reference to the neighborhood school policy. Much of 643*643 the ultimate \nconclusion of this court on the question of segregative intent must be based on an \nevaluation of the role played by this policy, the motivations behind the district's adherence \nto it, and the propriety under the law of the district's staunch reliance on it to justify its \nactions. \nThis court's finding that the facts in this case do not support an inference of segregative \nintent, therefore, is based in large part on its conclusion that the neighborhood school policy \nwas developed and has continued to be embraced by the district's officials because of a \nsincere belief in its beneficial effects on the educational process and not in order to use \nsuch a policy to perpetuate segregation. The racial imbalance in the schools is a result of \nresidential and demographic changes. There is no evidence in this case of gerrymandering \nof attendance areas, use of optional attendance zones, transporting of students across \ncontiguous attendance areas, and other actions which in other cases have put the lie to the \nassertion of a neutral neighborhood school policy. Nor is there any evidence in this case \n\n \n \nthat, despite the existence of a consistently and neutrally applied neighborhood school \npolicy, an inference of segregative intent should be drawn from the SJUSD's selection of \nsites, the closure or abandonment of schools, or the assignment of faculty and staff. Arthur \nv. Nyquist, supra, 573 F.2d at 144-45; N.A.A.C.P. v. Lansing Board of Education, 559 F.2d \n1042, 1049-57 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 997, 98 S.Ct. 635, 54 L.Ed.2d 491 \n(1977); United States v. Texas Education Agency, supra, 564 F.2d at 169-70; Armstrong v. \nO'Connell, 451 F.Supp. 817, 829-30 (E.D.Mich.1978); Berry v. School District of Benton \nHarbor, 442 F.Supp. 1280, 1325-26 (W.D.Mich.1977). Moreover, the evidence does not \nsuggest that the past acts of the school board have contributed significantly to the \nresidential segregation of the attendance areas. If such had been the case, there might \nhave been grounds for holding that the present assertion of a neighborhood school policy \nwas designed to perpetuate segregated schools. Taylor v. Board of Education of City \nSchool District of City of New Rochelle, supra, 191 F.Supp. at 195-96. See also the \ndiscussion and cases cited in our initial opinion, 412 F.Supp. at 334-35. Finally, there was \nno evidence introduced in this case which supports a finding that other actions by state \nofficials caused or contributed to the segregation in the residential patterns of the SJUSD \nwhich, combined with the elongated shape of the district, results in the racial imbalance of \nschools organized along neighborhood lines. \nUnder these circumstances, there is no reason to condemn the school district for its \ndecision to stick with the concept of neighborhood schools. Smiley v. Vollert, supra, 453 \nF.Supp. at 481. As the Supreme Court wrote in Dayton Board of Education v. \nBrinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 413, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 2772, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977), \"The finding that \nthe pupil population in the various ... schools is not homogeneous, standing by itself, is not \na violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of a showing that this condition \nresulted from intentionally segregative actions on the part of the Board. Washington v. \nDavis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 [96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597] ....\" Without any evidence \nof manipulation or bad faith in the adoption and maintenance of a neighborhood school \npolicy, the courts have consistently recognized the reasonableness of the choice by \neducators and administrators in favor of neighborhood schools. Brody-Jones v. \nMacchiarola, supra, 503 F.Supp. at 1247; United States v. Texas Education Agency, \nsupra, 564 F.2d at 168 n.9; Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55, 60 (6th Cir. \n1966), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114 (1967). This choice seems \nparticularly reasonable in light of the evidence in the record that the SJUSD wished to move \ntowards more decentralization of school administration and governance. \nThe court is mindful of the Ninth Circuit's admonition that \"we do not believe that a \nneighborhood school policy, no matter how consistently followed, can be a determinative \nfact in proving the ultimate fact of forbidden purpose.\" 612 F.2d at 644*644 415.[7] However, \nin deciding the ultimate question of segregative intent, this court's evaluation of the basis \nupon which such a policy was developed and maintained will greatly effect the weight given \nthe district's reliance on such a policy. In this case, it is the court's conclusion, after \nweighing all the evidence, that the adherence to a neighborhood school policy by the school \nofficials in the SJUSD was not a device for maintenance of segregative schools, although \nthat effect was clearly foreseeable and was clearly foreseen by the school officials. \nMoreover, this good faith belief in the advantages of a neighborhood school policy means \nthat the court does not infer the necessary segregative intent from the various instances \n\n \n \nwhere the school officials chose the alternative which preserved the neighborhood school \nconcept, rather than adopt another alternative which would have required the abandonment \nof that policy. This evaluation of the role played by the neighborhood school policy in the \ndecisions made by the school officials is not only proper, but absolutely necessary to the \nreaching of a proper conclusion by this court on the issue of segregative intent. \nThis conclusion concerning the neighborhood school policy, along with the court's \nevaluation of the other decisions by the district which were only collaterally affected by the \npolicy, or which were not affected at all by reference to that policy, leads this court to its \nfinding that the evidence does not support an inference of the necessary intent to segregate \nsuch as would necessitate a finding of liability. See Personnel Administrator of \nMassachusetts v. Feeney, supra, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296; Washington v. Davis, \nsupra, 426 U.S. at 239-42, 96 S.Ct. at 2047-49. \nVI CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, the court wishes to emphasize an important point made in its earlier decision, \n412 F.Supp. at 335-36. This court would be extremely disturbed and saddened if its \ndecision in this case was interpreted by either of the parties to this action or the public as \nencouragement to the Board to lie back and accept the consequences of the imbalance. \nContinued failure to choose the path which leads towards less ethnic imbalance in the \nschools could well, at some future time, form the basis for a conclusion that the school \nofficials do, in fact, wish to keep the Anglos and the Spanish-surnamed students segregated \nin the SJUSD. So, it should be clear that the Board of Trustees takes a precarious path if it \nthinks it can continue forever to walk the thin line between a duty to integrate, which does \nnot exist under federal constitutional principles, and the continuing obligation not to \nsegregate intentionally, which would open the district to liability under federal law. \nAccordingly, this court orders that judgment be entered in this case in favor of the \ndefendants. \nSO ORDERED. \n[1] Although under state law the district still had a couple of years to replace the pre-Field Act facilities, a major \nearthquake in the Los Angeles area in February of 1971 led the school board to vote to close all pre-Field Act schools \nat the end of the school year and to establish a Building Master Plan Task Group for the purpose of planning and \nconstructing new facilities for the students displaced by these closures by the fall of 1972. \n[2] The Westinghouse Learning Corporation was commissioned to make recommendations on ways to improve racial \nbalance in the course of the major construction made necessary by the closure of the Field Act schools. This report \nwas officially submitted to the Building Master Task Group, although the record indicated that the school board and \nother school officials were aware of the report's contents and recommendations. \n[3] When the Building Master Task Group was established, local committees were organized around each of the five \nHigh School Attendance areas. While there was evidence introduced that, in hindsight, some officials thought that this \nmethod of organization undermined the elements of the community favoring changes which would result in greater \nethnic balance in the schools, there is no evidence to suggest that this was anything more than a strategic error; \nthere is no evidence that the Task Group was organized in this manner for the purpose of undermining integration, \n\n \n \nnor is there any evidence in fact that anyone could have or did predict that this organizational decision would cause \nthis result. \n[4] There is some evidence in the record that the Airport Land Use Commission would have moved to prevent the \nrebuilding of the Wilson school on the old site because it was in the flight path of the San Jose Municipal Airport. \nHowever, the question never went as far as formal condemnation hearings. See Reporter's Transcript at 1375-77. For \nfurther findings concerning the decision not to rebuild Wilson, see 412 F.Supp. at 321. \n[5] Longfellow was apparently not rebuilt because of the construction of a new highway at or near the site of the \nschool. See Reporter's Transcript at 1375. \n[6] A similar set of visuals were introduced by the defendants in the trial on the merits, identified as defendants' \nExhibit H. Upon return of the materials in this case to this court from the Court of Appeals, however, those visuals \nwere missing. Neither plaintiffs nor defendants were aware of their location, nor could they provide duplicates. The \ncourt, however, is certain that the visual referred to, which was introduced at the preliminary injunction stage of the \nproceedings, accurately depicts the changes which were also shown in the aforementioned Exhibit H. \n[7] (Footnote omitted.) \n ",

After a careful review of the \nrecord, we conclude that the district court's finding that the defendants acted without \nsegregative intent was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we reverse. \nI. BACKGROUND. \nThe Board of Education of the San Jose Unified School District (the Board) has been aware \nsince at least 1962 that its schools are segregated. The district is long and narrow: about \nsixteen miles long and from one and one-half to four miles wide. Hispanics are concentrated \nin the 662*662 northern downtown area while the southern, suburban neighborhoods are \nlargely Anglo. In 1973, Spanish-surnamed students made up 24.6 percent of the population \nof the district. In the southern schools, only .07 percent of the students were Spanish-\n \n\n \n \nsurnamed, while in the northern schools 78.8 percent were Spanish-surnamed. State law \nrequires the Board to take affirmative steps to desegregate its schools. The Board made \nrepeated announcements endorsing the concept of desegregation. Nonetheless, between \n1962 and 1973, the school board did nothing to alleviate the imbalance. Indeed, the Board \ntook many steps that maintained segregation and rejected available, less segregative \ncourses of action. \nIn 1971, the plaintiffs filed a class action on behalf of all Spanish-surnamed students \nenrolled in the District and their parents. The complaint charged that defendants were \noperating a segregated public school system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and \nsought desegregation of the school district. After trial to the court, the district court found \nthat the school district was racially imbalanced and that defendants had maintained the \nimbalance. The court, however, denied remedial relief because it decided that defendants \nhad acted without segregative intent. Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 412 F.Supp. \n310 (N.D.Cal.1976) (Diaz I). \nOn appeal, this court vacated and remanded for reconsideration. Diaz v. San Jose Unified \nSchool District, 612 F.2d 411, 416 (9th Cir.1979) (Diaz II). We found that \"[a]n inference of \nsegregative intent arose from the appellants' proof,\" Id. at 415. The district court had, \nhowever, impermissibly concluded that the school district's racially neutral neighborhood \nschool policy \"constituted either a complete defense to a charge of segregative intent, or, \ncompletely dispelled the inferences of segregative intent that flowed from the appellants' \nproof.\" Id. We held that \"[s]trict adherence to a neighborhood policy is no more than \ncircumstantial evidence that bears upon the existence or non-existence of segregative \nintent. The existence of such a policy is not enough to prove the absence of segregative \nintent.\" Id. at 416. \nOn remand, the district court required rebriefing and argument but took no new evidence. \nOnce again, the court found the evidence insufficient to support a finding of segregative \nintent, holding that \"the adherence to a neighborhood school policy by the school officials in \nthe [San Jose Unified School District] was not a device for maintenance of segregated \nschools, although that effect was clearly foreseeable and was clearly foreseen by the school \nofficials.\" Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 518 F.Supp. 622, 644 (N.D.Cal.1981) \n(Diaz III). Plaintiffs appeal. \nII. DISCUSSION. \nA. The Need to Prove Segregative Intent. \nThe Board admits that it has maintained ethnically imbalanced schools and has omitted \ncourses of action that would have reduced that imbalance. Plaintiffs presented \noverwhelming evidence that the Board's actions \"knowingly perpetuated ethnic imbalance in \nthe schools.\" Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 642. Nonetheless, de facto segregation in the schools \ndoes not, without more, prove a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs must \nprove not only that the defendants' actions created or maintained racial or ethnic imbalance \nin the schools, but also that those actions were motivated by segregative intent. See Keyes \n \n\n \n \nv. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2697, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 \n(1973); Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 328-29. \nOrdinarily, only circumstantial evidence is available to establish segregative intent. \nEvidence of the discriminatory impact of decisions is one sort of circumstantial evidence \nsupporting an inference of segregative intent. \nThe impact of the official action — whether it \"bears more heavily on one race than another\" \n... — may provide an important starting point. Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on \ngrounds 663*663 other than race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the \ngoverning legislation appears neutral on its face. \nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97 S.Ct. \n555, 564, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Proof that the segregative effects of a decision were \nforeseeable is not to be taken, as a general proposition, to make out a prima facie case of \nsegregative intent, nor does it routinely shift the burden of persuasion to the \ndefendants. See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 536 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. \n2971, 2978 n. 9, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979) (Dayton). Nonetheless, \"proof of foreseeable \nconsequences is one type of quite relevant evidence of racially discriminatory \npurpose....\" Id. See also Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 464-65, 99 \nS.Ct. 2941, 2949-50, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979) (Columbus).[1] Other circumstantial evidence \nrelevant to the proof of segregative intent includes the historical background and specific \nsequence of events leading up to the Board's actions maintaining or exacerbating ethnic \nimbalance in district schools. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267-68, 97 S.Ct. at 564-65. \nWe will focus our review on these latter aspects of the proof, for the defendants concede \nthat they knowingly perpetuated segregation. \nB. Standard of Review. \nWe examine the district court's findings of fact and its ultimate conclusion as to the Board's \nintent under the clearly erroneous standard: \ndiscriminatory intent is a finding of fact to be made by the trial court.... [It] means actual \nmotive; it is not a legal presumption to be drawn from a factual showing of something less \nthan actual motive. Thus, a court of appeals may only reverse a district court's finding on \ndiscriminatory intent if it concludes that the finding is clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a). \nPullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 289-90, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790-91, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 \n(1982). Accord Dayton, 443 U.S. at 534, 99 S.Ct. at 2977; Columbus, 443 U.S. at 468, 99 \nS.Ct. at 2952 (1979) (Burger, C.J., concurring). \nUnder this standard the district court's factual finding of lack of segregative intent may be \nset aside only if, \"although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire \nevidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been \ncommitted.\" United States v. United States Gypsum, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, \n \n\n \n \n92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, Inc., 684 F.2d 1316, \n1318 (9th Cir.1982). \nIn this case our careful review of the record leaves us with such a firm conviction. The \ndistrict court has made comprehensive 664*664 and accurate findings covering the \nsignificant historical facts, but we are firmly convinced that it erred when it reached the \nultimate conclusion that these facts do not compel a finding of segregative intent. \nC. The Neighborhood School Policy. \nThe significance of the Board's adherence to a \"neighborhood school policy\" was central to \nthe district court's analysis. This policy requires students to attend the schools nearest their \nhomes. The Board has, with few exceptions, adhered to this policy rigidly and refused to \nallow voluntary transfers for any purpose, including voluntary desegregation.[2] Although a \nneighborhood school policy has been used by school districts to justify \nsegregation, see Dayton, 443 U.S. at 533 n. 7, 99 S.Ct. at 2976 n. 7; Columbus, 443 U.S. at \n461-62 & n. 8, 99 S.Ct. at 2948-49 & n. 8; Keyes, 413 U.S. at 206, 93 S.Ct. at \n2696, adherence to such a policy is not by itself dispositive of segregative intent. We \nrecognized in our previous opinion that the neighborhood school policy \"is merely relevant \nevidence to be taken into account in deciding whether the forbidden intent did or did not \nexist.\" Diaz II, 612 F.2d at 415. It \"does not have constitutional implications one way or the \nother without a penetrating examination of the complete context in which the neighborhood \npolicy was initially applied and subsequently enforced.\" Id. \nWe must distinguish, however, between a policy requiring students to attend schools within \nneighborhood attendance areas, and the decision to draw those attendance areas in a \nmanner that achieves or maintains ethnic imbalance. School buildings are large, immobile \nobjects. For many school districts, the location of existing schools will more or less \ndetermine feasible attendance areas. Where neighborhoods are themselves racially or \nethnically imbalanced, the enforcement of a neighborhood school policy may perpetuate de \nfacto segregation. As we read the Supreme Court's pronouncements we cannot require a \nschool district with no history of de jure segregation to abandon its neighborhood school \npolicy merely because the infeasibility of relocating its schools has caused the \nentrenchment of segregation. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1282, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). As we explained in \nour previous opinion, however, the location and construction of new schools and the closing \nof old schools are not merely decisions enforcing a neighborhood school policy. Rather, \nthey are decisions that may determine whether the prescribed neighborhood attendance \nareas will be integrated or segregated. See Diaz II, 612 F.2d at 415. The Supreme Court \nhas recognized that \n[i]n the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or \nmaintaining a state-segregated school system. In addition to the classic pattern of building \nschools specifically intended for Negro or white students, school authorities have \nsometimes, since Brown [v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 \n(1954)], closed schools which appeared likely to become racially mixed through changes in \n \n\n \n \nneighborhood residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by building new \nschools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro population centers in \norder to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum departure from the formal \nprinciples of \"neighborhood zoning\". \n665*665 Swann, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278. A school district may combine its \nneighborhood school policy with a segregative pattern of site selection. In such cases, the \nenforcement of a neighborhood school policy may be one of a series of segregative acts \nindependently evincing segregative intent. Many of these same actions disapproved by the \nSupreme Court in Swann are also present in this case. \nFurthermore, adherence to a neighborhood school policy may have a reciprocal effect by \nmaking neighborhoods more segregated. \nThe construction of new schools and the closing of old ones ... when combined with one \ntechnique or another of student assignment, will determine the racial composition of the \nstudent body in each school in the system. Over the long run, the consequences of the \nchoices will be far reaching. People gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are \nlocated in response to the needs of people. The location of schools may thus influence the \npattern of residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on \ncomposition of inner-city neighborhoods. \nId. at 20-21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278. \nIn this case, a series of events unrelated to the ethnic imbalance of the District's schools \nrequired the Board to make a large number of choices relating to school siting, school \nconstruction, the use of portable classrooms and the definition or redefinition of \nneighborhood attendance areas. Each time, parents, interested organizations and the State \nof California presented alternative proposals to the Board that could have ameliorated the \nsegregation in the district schools. Most of these opportunities presented no threat to the \nneighborhood school policy and could have been accomplished within its framework. The \nBoard consistently selected the more segregative alternative. \nD. Board Awareness of Segregation and its Duty to \nDesegregate. \nThroughout the period in question the Board was aware of ethnic imbalance in the district \nschools.[3] The Board was also continuously aware that it had an affirmative duty to \ndesegregate under state law.[4] \nIn 1963, the California Supreme Court held that: \neven in the absence of gerrymandering or other affirmative discriminatory conduct by a \nschool board, a student under some circumstances would be entitled to relief where, by \nreason of residential segregation, 666*666 substantial racial imbalance exists in his \n \n\n \n \nschool.... [w]here such segregation exists, it is not enough for a school board to refrain from \naffirmative discriminatory conduct. The harmful influence on the children will be reflected \nand intensified in the classroom if school attendance is determined on a geographic basis \nwithout corrective measures. The right to an equal opportunity for education and the harmful \nconsequences of segregation require that school boards take steps, insofar as reasonably \nfeasible, to alleviate racial imbalance in schools regardless of its cause. Our State Board of \nEducation has adopted regulations which encourage transfers to avoid and eliminate racial \nsegregation (Cal.Admin.Code, Title 5, §§ 2010, 2011) ... \nJackson v. Pasadena City School District, 59 Cal.2d 876, 881, 31 Cal.Rptr. 606, 382 P.2d \n878 (1963) (emphasis added). \nIn 1976, the California Supreme Court reapproved the Jackson holding, recognizing that \n\"for more than a decade this court has adhered to the position that school boards in this \nstate bear a constitutional obligation to attempt to alleviate school segregation, regardless \nof its cause.\" Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles, 17 Cal.3d 280, \n293, 130 Cal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28 (1976). The California courts throughout the period \nconsistently had reiterated this obligation of local school boards. See Crawford, 17 Cal.3d at \n291-92, 130 Cal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28 (citing Mulkey v. Reitman, 64 Cal.2d 529, 537, 50 \nCal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825 (1966); San Francisco Unified School District v. Johnson, 3 \nCal.3d 937, 957-58, 92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 479 P.2d 669 (1971); Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584, \n96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241 (1971)). The district court was clearly erroneous in its \nfinding that the Board's obligations under state law were in constant flux. See Diaz I, 412 \nF.Supp. at 334; Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 642 (incorporating findings of Diaz I). The \nobligations were clear and the Board was aware of them.[5] \nYet, during this period, the Board resisted compliance with state requirements that \naffirmative action be taken to desegregate its schools. In a 1966 report to the State \nDepartment of Education, the Board recognized that it was not meeting the State's \nguidelines. The Board acknowledged that it had been subject to \"considerable pressure\" to \nalter its neighborhood school policy,[6] and stated in the report: \n667*667 District representatives were informed that the State Board of Education felt it had a \n\"mandate\" to expedite integration in all schools; that social integration of all pupils carried \nthe highest priority, regardless; that the traditional neighborhood school concept was no \nlonger valid in districts characterized by \"racial imbalance,\" and that the subsequent year's \nprojects (1967-68) would be required to \"focus\" on intergroup experiences and the general \nproblem of de facto segregation in order to be approved for funding. \n(emphasis in original). \nDespite its recognized duty to take affirmative steps to desegregate, the Board continued to \njustify actions that maintained segregation by reference to its neighborhood school policy. \nThe Board's stubborn adherence to this policy in the face of clearly established state law \nholding desegregation to be a matter of overriding educational importance suggests that the \nBoard was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to avoid desegregation rather than a \nsincere commitment to the educational benefits of neighborhood schools.[7] \n \n\n \n \nE. School Siting and Transportation. \nDespite the Board's awareness of the problem of ethnic imbalance and its duty to alleviate \nit, the Board chose alternatives that perpetuated or intensified segregation and rejected \nnumerous unusual opportunities to reduce segregation that became available throughout \nthe years. \nSince 1965, the district has constructed nine new schools on newly-selected sites.[8] The \nBoard was aware that state law required it to consider state guidelines on the formation of \nattendance areas in making siting decisions. Nonetheless, the Board failed to consider the \nstate guidelines[9] and 668*668 selected sites with the knowledge that each of the newly \nconstructed schools would be imbalanced from inception, although alternatives existed. \nThroughout the relevant time period, the Board received a number of communications from \nstate agencies, advising it that district schools were impermissibly segregated and insisting \nthat it follow state guidelines. The Board chose to disregard state law totally. \nThe Board similarly chose to maintain ethnic imbalance when it closed several northern \nschools. The district court went through an extensive and careful analysis of the pattern of \nschool closures. See Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 319-22, 331-32; Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 632-35. \nThe conclusion from this analysis can be summarized easily — little change occurred. \nPlaintiffs aptly refer to these actions as the \"downtown shuffle.\" Where northern schools \nwere closed, the Board reassigned students to other schools in the north rather than \nreassigning them to schools further south as suggested by numerous proposals. The district \ncourt noted two particularly disturbing aspects of the decision to close two downtown junior \nhigh schools. First, the restructuring of junior high school attendance areas resulted in two \ndistinct feeder systems, one for the area that was predominantly Hispanic and another for \nthe area that was predominantly Anglo. Second, the transfer of students transformed one of \nthe district's few ethnically balanced schools into an imbalanced school. See Diaz III, 518 \nF.Supp. at 634. \nPursuant to the Field Act,[10] the Board demolished thirteen additional schools as unsafe. \nThe Board created a task group to establish a plan for rebuilding the schools. The task \ngroup considered several proposals to rebuild the schools in new locations and to redraw \nattendance areas in order to reduce ethnic imbalance. The district court found that several \nof the alternatives would have reduced ethnic imbalance. Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 331. The \nBoard chose to rebuild most of the Field Act schools on their original sites and to maintain \nthe former attendance areas.[11] The Board rebuilt two Field Act schools on newly selected \nsites. However, it retained the old attendance area boundaries, and both schools remained \nimbalanced. \nDuring this time the Board considered, and rejected, a proposal to transfer students from \nthe most severely imbalanced Field Act schools to nearby schools in contiguous attendance \nareas. Washington 669*669 School had a student population of 78.4% Spanish-surnamed. \nBecause of overcrowding, Washington students attended double sessions. One mile from \nWashington, Riverglen School had a Spanish-surnamed population of only 19.2% and was \noperating under capacity. The Board refused to redraw attendance areas or to transfer any \n \n\n \n \nstudents from the overcrowded Washington to Riverglen. Students from the Little Orchard \nneighborhood, which is almost 100% Spanish-surnamed, were assigned for years to \nWashington even though they actually lived closer to Riverglen. \nGardner School had a Spanish-surnamed population of 87.8%. Lincoln Glen, located two \nmiles from Gardner, had a Spanish-surnamed population of 15% and was operating under \ncapacity. Canoas School, located three or four miles from Gardner, had a Spanish-\nsurnamed population of 9.7% and was operating under capacity. The Board never \nconsidered transferring students from Gardner to Canoas or to Lincoln Glen. \nDespite strong opposition to the rebuilding of Washington and Gardner in their original \nlocations and the presentation of feasible options to decrease segregation, the Board rebuilt \nthem in their original locations and retained the same attendance areas. These actions were \ntaken by the Board in the face of assurances to the State that the Board would use the \nopportunity presented by the rebuilding of the schools to reduce ethnic imbalance. \nSchool District Superintendent Knight justified the rebuilding of the Field Act schools on the \nsame sites on the ground that it \"would not get in the way of a two-way exchange of \nstudents.\" This justification must be viewed with suspicion in light of the Board's repeated \nand vocal opposition to busing to achieve integration. The district court found that \"[a]s early \nas 1963, the board, through resolution, assured the community of its opposition to busing \nfor integration; the board has not deviated from this position.\" Id. at 324. The Board \nproclaimed that it would rebuild on the same sites in order to bus more effectively, while at \nthe same time pronouncing it would never bus because it was seeking other solutions to the \nsegregation problem. \nThe Board's wide use of busing for everything except integration is itself suspect. In 1973-\n74, 10,431 of 36,000 students were bused daily. All but 14 of the district's 50 schools used \nbuses to transport students within designated attendance areas. Studies commissioned by \nthe district showed that the total busing required to integrate the district would involve only \n6,000 students — 3,000 Hispanic students and 3,000 Anglo students. The Board was \nclearly not opposed to busing per se, yet it repeatedly voiced its opposition to busing for the \npurposes of integration. The Board's use of buses for every purpose but integration, \ncoupled with its intransigent resistance to the use of buses for integration, supports an \ninference of segregative intent. Cf. Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, 458 U.S. \n457, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982) (initiative that treated busing for integration \ndifferently from busing for other purposes invalid). \nIn summary, the Board responded to a series of opportunities to select school locations and \ndesignate the boundaries of attendance areas by selecting sites and designating \nboundaries in a manner that ensured continued segregation. \"In ascertaining the existence \nof legally imposed school segregation, the existence of a pattern of school construction and \nabandonment is ... a factor of great weight.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278-\n79. See also Dayton, 443 U.S. at 540, 99 S.Ct. at 2980. The Board responded to \nsuggestions for less segregative alternatives by rejecting them. It responded to the \nguidelines imposed by the State of California by ignoring them. \n \n\n \n \nF. Overcrowding, Faculty Assignment and Educational \nPriorities. \nThe Board response to overcrowding was two-fold — the use of portables and double \nsessions. At one point, the Board instituted double sessions in overcrowded \nsouthern 670*670 schools even though some northern schools were operating under \ncapacity.[12] The district court found this disturbing because of the known \"educationally \ndisadvantageous\" effects of double sessions. Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 635. \nDefendants admit that faculty and staff were intentionally assigned to schools on the basis \nof race. The Hispanic teachers were concentrated in the downtown schools. The district \ncourt found that assignments were not made in order to assign Spanish-speaking teachers \nto predominantly Mexican-American schools where their language skills might be \nneeded. Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 640-41. The district court concluded that the assignment of \nteachers or staff was not the result of a racially-neutral policy. Id. at 641. \nA discriminative pattern of assignment of faculty and staff is among the most important \nindicia of a segregated school system. Swann, 402 U.S. at 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277. The district \ncourt correctly observed that the law does not permit assignment of faculty on the basis of \nrace even if motivated by a neutral policy, Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 640. The district court \nfound the staff and teacher assignments had no effect on student segregation because of \nthe small number of Spanish-surnamed faculty. Its observations may be accurate, but it \nneither negates the illegality of the assignment policy nor diminishes the inference of racial \nbias. \nThe Board rejected an opportunity to reduce segregation through use of portable \nclassrooms. The district owns over 400 portable classrooms and leases others. Portable \nclassrooms, because they are not fixed in one place, provide an inexpensive and flexible \nway to alter attendance boundaries to reduce overcrowding and ethnic imbalance in \nparticular schools. The district court found that the use of portables to increase integration \n\"was always an alternative available when a need for portables arose; the school district \ncould always have opted to place new portables at the other end of the district from the area \nof overcrowding....\" Diaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 635. Nevertheless, the Board rejected \nnumerous suggestions for portable siting to alter attendance patterns involving transferring \nHispanic students from northern schools to schools farther south. The district has never \nused portables to improve ethnic imbalance. \nIn one instance in 1974 the Board did depart from its neighborhood school policy when \nAnglo parents in the southern schools complained about the double sessions. The Board \nallowed them to go out of the district rather than transfer to the northern schools in which \nHispanic students predominated. \nAt a school board meeting on May 2, 1974, a group of Anglo parents demanded that their \nchildren be relieved of double sessions at Muir and Bret Harte junior high schools. On May \n16, the board responded by authorizing inter-district transfers permitting Anglo students to \nattend schools outside their neighborhood attendance areas for the 1974-1975 and 1975-\n \n\n \n \n1976 school years. Executive sessions of the board met with the district superintendent and \nthe board attorney to reevaluate the newly-enacted authorization of inter-district transfers. \nCounsel for the board advised the district that the court in this litigation might adversely \ninterpret deviation from the board's stated adherence to a neighborhood school policy, in \ncircumstances which relieved crowding while perpetuating 671*671 ethnic imbalance. On \nJune 20, 1974, after receiving this advice, the board rescinded its transfer resolution. \nDiaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 323. \nWe agree with the advice the Board received from its counsel that the resolution could be \ninterpreted as evidence of segregative intent. The later recission of the resolution because \nof counsel's advice does not lessen the implication. \nThe Board argues that the segregation in district schools results solely from its \nneighborhood school policy. The evidence in the record, however, demonstrates that the \npattern of decisions relating to school siting, school closings, designation of attendance \nareas, busing, use of portable classrooms, double sessions and transfers maintained or \nexacerbated ethnic imbalance. None of these decisions was required by the neighborhood \nschool policy; indeed, the Board rejected numerous alternative proposals that were \nconsistent with the neighborhood school policy. The Board's willingness to depart from its \nneighborhood school policy in assigning students from the Little Orchard neighborhood to \nWashington rather than Riverglen and permitting students from the Anglo-dominated Muir \nand Bret Harte Schools to transfer to other Anglo-dominated schools indicates that the \nBoard was willing to forego its neighborhood school policy in order to maintain segregation. \nPlaintiffs have presented additional evidence that suggests that the neighborhood school \npolicy itself was a pretext for the Board's hostility to integration. \nG. The Board's Public Response to Acknowledged \nSegregation. \nThe Board's ostensible attempts to alleviate the problem of school segregation support the \nconclusion that its adherence to a neighborhood school policy was motivated, at least in \npart, by segregative intent. The Board's actions reveal a pattern of resisting suggestions \nthat would have decreased segregation and submitting to political pressure from members \nof the community opposed to integration. One example is the Board's response to efforts by \nthe State of California to secure compliance with its integration policy.[13] The Board acted in \nseveral instances to maintain a posture of commitment to its obligations under state law, \nalthough it actually did nothing. In conjunction with the rebuilding of the Field Act schools, \nthe Board assured the State that it would rebuild the schools on different sites to achieve \ngreater ethnic balance. It did not. And, the Board formally adopted the state guidelines on \nformulation of attendance areas but did not implement them when faced with an \nopportunity.[14] In 672*672 its 1966 report to the State in conjunction with its ethnic survey, \nthe Board cited its 1963 resolution on desegregation and the intent to form a citizen's \ncommittee to study the problem of segregation and recommended solutions. That \ncommittee, the Quality Urban Education Action Team (QUEST), was not formed until 1969. \nQUEST's history is revealing. The Board repeatedly referred to QUEST in its reports to the \n \n\n \n \nstate as an indication of progress toward integration, while responding to QUEST in a \nmanner that rendered the committee totally ineffective. \nThe record shows that at a highly emotional meeting of 1500 persons where \"fear and \nracism\" were prevalent, the Board submitted to public pressure and opened QUEST \nmembership to all present — most of whom were opposed to desegregation. See infra note \n16. These new members were given their choice of subcommittees on which to serve, and \nmost joined the site location, demographics and magnet school committees. At the same \ntime, the Board modified QUEST's mandate, instructing it to pay more attention to revision \nof instructional programs and less attention to attempting to reduce ethnic imbalance \nwithout delay.[15] \nBoard members told Aaron Harris, Chairperson of QUEST, that the Board would like to \ndissolve or suspend QUEST because the public perceived that integration would result and \nthat such a perception might have adverse impact upon the upcoming bond election. Over \nMr. Harris's opposition, the executive committee of the reconstituted QUEST voted to \nsuspend activities, a decision in which Harris stated, \"the Board happily acquiesced.\" \nDespite these difficulties, QUEST put together a final report making recommendations for \nsolutions to the segregation problem, including magnet schools, education parks, open \nenrollment, and voluntary busing.[16] 673*673 The Board implemented none of QUEST's \nsuggestions. \nAny doubts about whether the Board acted with segregative intent are dispelled by its public \nstatements regarding the bond issue elections. The district court found that these \nstatements \noffered 1) the carrot that the bond money would not be used to subsidize busing (and \nreiterated the Board's own continued disinclination to use busing for integration purposes) \nand 2) the stick that failure to pass the bond issue would result in (a) alterations in the \nneighborhood school policy to spread double sessions throughout the district and (b) the \nneed to send students from the northern end of the district to the south, and/or vice versa. \nDiaz III, 518 F.Supp. at 638. The Board catered to a pro-segregation public by \nmaking 674*674 assurances that it could not use bond money to finance busing for \nintegration. The message these statements conveyed, and were intended to convey, was \nunmistakable: if the public did not vote for the bond issue, busing would result. If it did vote \nfor the issue, no busing would result. These statements, considered in the context of the \nother evidence presented in this case compel an inference of segregative intent.[17] \nIII. THE CUMULATIVE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE \nCOMPELS A FINDING OF SEGREGATIVE INTENT. \nIn making its determination in respect to the Board's intent, the district court erred in failing \nto give weight to the cumulative impact of the evidence. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. \n229, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2048, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976); Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-\n \n\n \n \n68, 97 S.Ct. at 563-65; Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386, 1389 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 \nU.S. 875, 101 S.Ct. 218, 66 L.Ed.2d 96 (1980). \nThe District repeatedly promised the public and state officials that it would desegregate its \nschools in compliance with state law. Yet, it deliberately ignored state guidelines in making \ndecisions and consistently refused to implement suggestions for desegregation. Similarly, \nin Columbus, an element of the district court's finding of segregative intent was the Board's \nfailure to employ workable suggestions for improving racial balance despite promises \notherwise. See Columbus, 443 U.S. at 453, 99 S.Ct. at 2944.[18] \nThe Board sited new schools, rebuilt the Field Act schools, used portables and closed \nschools in a manner that maintained and, in some instances, intensified ethnic imbalance. \nThe Supreme Court found such actions to evince segregative intent in Columbus, 443 U.S. \nat 462 & n. 11, 467, 99 S.Ct. at 2949 & n. 11, 2951 (site selection and \nconstruction),[19] in Dayton, 443 U.S. at 532, 533 n. 7, 540, 99 S.Ct. at 2976, 2976 n. 7, \n2980 (siting, construction, and addition of classroom space at existing schools), \nin Swann, 402 U.S. at 20-21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278-1279 (construction and closures); and \nin Keyes, 413 U.S. at 192, 93 S.Ct. at 2689 (construction, mobile classrooms). \nThe Board used buses for one-third of its students, but refused to use those buses to \nachieve integration. See Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 486-87, \n102 S.Ct. 3187, 3203-04, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982) (invalidating a Washington initiative that \ntreated busing for integration differently from busing for other purposes). Cf. Swann, 402 \nU.S. at 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277 (existing policy of transportation an \nimportant 675*675 consideration in identifying a segregated system). \nThe Board assigned faculty and staff on the basis of ethnic origin without any plausible \nneutral justification. See Columbus, 443 U.S. at 460, 461, 467, 99 S.Ct. at 2948, 2948, \n2951; Dayton, 443 U.S. at 532, 536 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 2976, 2978 n. 9; Swann, 402 U.S. at \n18-19, 91 S.Ct. at 1277-1278; Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 435, 88 S.Ct. \n1689, 1692, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). \nThe Board responded to overcrowding in the schools by instituting educationally \ndisadvantageous double sessions and departed from its neighborhood school policy to \navoid transferring Anglo students to predominantly Hispanic schools. See Columbus, 443 \nU.S. at 461-62 n. 8, n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 2948-49 n. 8, n. 9 (departure from neighborhood \nschool policy); Dayton, 443 U.S. at 539-40, 99 S.Ct. at 2980-81 (use of optional attendance \nzones); Keyes, 413 U.S. at 191, 93 S.Ct. at 2688 (manipulation of attendance zones). \nThe Board catered to a public that opposed segregation. This is evidenced by the Board's \nstatements supporting the bond issues, in which it raised the spectre of busing for \nintegration if the levy was not passed. The Board was instrumental in transforming the \nQUEST committee from a group of concerned citizens to one dominated by those opposed \nto desegregation. The Board ignored the recommendations the committee made and \nconsistently rejected other suggestions for desegregating its schools. \n \n\n \n \nAn inescapable conclusion that the Board intended segregation emerges from a view of the \nevidence as a whole. The pattern of Board choices that consistently maintained or \nintensified segregation is apparent. Although many of the available alternatives would have \npresented an incomplete solution, each could have contributed incrementally toward \nreducing ethnic imbalance. In almost every instance, the Board chose to \"turn toward \nsegregation\" rather than away from it. Columbus, 443 U.S. at 463 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2949 n. \n12. We are left with the firm conviction that the district court was clearly erroneous in its \nultimate conclusion that the Board did not act with segregative intent. \nIV. CONCLUSION. \nWe hold that the San Jose School Board intentionally maintained segregated schools \nthroughout the District. We remand to the district court for the formation of an appropriate \nremedy and an award of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs. \nREVERSED and REMANDED. \nCHOY, Circuit Judge, with whom WALLACE and SNEED, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting: \nThe majority depicts the Board of Trustees of the San Jose Unified School District (the \n\"Board\") as an insensitive body eager to seize upon opportunities to maintain or exacerbate \nracial segregation in the school district for the past twenty years. One reading the majority \nopinion gets the impression that the Board's conduct was unexplainable and inexcusable, \nand that the district judge's ruling in the Board's favor has no redeeming feature whatever. \nThe majority, however, ignores many facts critical to the district court's ruling; then the \nmajority makes its own findings of fact to support its result. \nEven with the facts that have been ignored by the majority, I may not have come to the \nsame conclusions as did Judge Peckham if I had been the trial judge. But Judge Peckham \nhas been with this complex case since November of 1971. He has personally observed the \nwitnesses and has had the opportunity to test their believability. He thus was in a far better \nposition than are we to determine where the truth lies. See Columbus Board of Education v. \nPenick, 443 U.S. 449, 470-71, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 2983-84, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979) (Stewart, J., \nconcurring). I simply cannot say that he was so wrong as to justify this court's finding the \nfacts anew. Accordingly, I dissent. \n I. The Legal Standard Applied by the District \n676*676\nCourt \nFor the most part, the majority does not take issue with the legal standard applied by the \ndistrict court. In Part III of the opinion, however, the majority states that \"the district court \nerred in failing to give weight to the cumulative impact of the evidence.\" Maj. op. at 674. To \nthe extent that the majority suggests that the district court applied an improper legal \nstandard, the majority is clearly wrong. Although the district court reached a different \nconclusion from the majority, it certainly reached its result considering the evidence as a \n \n\n \n \nwhole. See, e.g., 518 F.Supp. at 629 (\"the court will ... attempt to explain ... why the court \ndoes not feel that the evidence, on balance, supports a finding of segregative intent \n....\"); id. at 638 (\"The refusal to date to consider bussing ... is not sufficient, in the context of \nthe rest of the evidence in this case, to support a finding of liability.\"). The majority is only \ntaking issue with the district court's factual findings. To these I now turn. \nII. The District's Duty Under State Law \nA theme recurring throughout the majority opinion is that failure of the Board to take steps \nallegedly required by state laws and state Board of Education guidelines convincingly \nproves that the Board segregated intentionally. To show a violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment a plaintiff must prove more than that a school district took actions that created \nor maintained ethnic imbalance. Doing so with intent to discriminate must be \nproved. See Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 464, 99 S.Ct. 2941, \n2949, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979); Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208, 93 S.Ct. \n2686, 2697, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). \nUnder the California Constitution, the school districts do have an affirmative obligation \"to \ntake reasonably feasible steps\" to alleviate school segregation. Crawford v. Board of \nEducation, 458 U.S. 527, 535-36, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3216-17, 73 L.Ed.2d 948 \n(1982); McKinny v. Oxnard Union High School District Board of Trustees, 31 Cal.3d 79, 92, \n642 P.2d 460, 467, 181 Cal.Rptr. 549, 556 (1982). Assuming arguendo that plaintiffs have \nshown facts constituting a violation of state law, the majority's attempt to transform a breach \nof a state-imposed duty into a Fourteenth Amendment violation cannot stand. \nDiscriminatory intent means that the actor selected his course of conduct \"because of\" \nrather than \"in spite of\" its adverse effects upon an identifiable group. Personnel \nAdministrator v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2296, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979). \nThe addition of an affirmative duty under state law to alleviate racial imbalance does not \ntransform inaction into intentional discrimination. Inaction in the face of an affirmative duty to \ndesegregate may suggest a higher probability of discriminatory intent than does inaction \nwhen no such duty exists. But the emphasis the majority places upon what it believes are \nstate law violations leads me to fear that it wishes to bludgeon the San Jose Unified School \nDistrict in federal court for a violation of state law. See Sullivan v. Murphy, 478 F.2d 938, \n972 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 880, 94 S.Ct. 162, 38 L.Ed.2d 125 (1973) (when \nconstitutional rights are infringed, federal rather than state law defines those rights); see \nalso Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 900, 911, 79 \nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984); Watson v. Tarpley, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 517, 520, 15 L.Ed. 509 \n(1855) (\"Whilst it will not be denied, that the laws of the several States are of binding \nauthority upon ... persons and property within their appropriate jurisdiction, it is perfectly \nclear that those laws cannot ... destroy or control the rights of parties litigant to whom the \nright of resort to [federal] courts has been secured by the laws and constitution [of the \nUnited States].\"). \nIII. The Proposals to Ameliorate Segregation \n \n\n \n \nThe majority observes that various organizations presented proposals to the Board that \n\"could have ameliorated\" the segregation, some of which allegedly presented no threat to \nthe neighborhood 677*677 school policy. See maj. op. at 665. The majority concludes that \nthe Board's failure to adopt one or more of these proposals conclusively demonstrates \nsegregative intent. I disagree. \nAlthough adherence to a neighborhood school policy in an area of de facto segregation \nprobably will perpetuate the segregation in the schools, most federal courts view the \nneighborhood school system as deeply rooted in American culture and soundly backed by \nnondiscriminatory reasons, see Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 245-48, 93 \nS.Ct. 2686, 2715-17, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in \npart); United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, 879 (5th \nCir.1966), aff'd en banc, 380 F.2d 385, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 67, 19 L.Ed.2d \n103 (1967); Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55, 60 (6th Cir.1966); see \nalso Crawford v. Board of Education, 458 U.S. 527, 537 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3218 n. 15, \n73 L.Ed.2d 948 (1982); United States v. Texas Education Agency (Austin Independent \nSchool District), 564 F.2d 162, 168 (5th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 443 U.S. 915, 99 S.Ct. \n3106, 61 L.Ed.2d 879 (1979). Adherence to a neighborhood school system could easily be \nexplained on nondiscriminatory grounds, and such adherence, without more, is thus no \nindication of discriminatory intent. \nThe majority finds discriminatory intent partly because the Board allegedly \"deliberately \nignored state guidelines in making decisions and consistently refused to implement \nsuggestions for desegregation.... The Board sited new schools, rebuilt the Field Act schools, \nused portables and closed schools in a manner that maintained and, in some instances, \nintensified ethnic imbalance.\" Maj. op. at 674. The majority, however, chooses to ignore the \ndistrict court's finding that \n[w]hile the district failed to consider the state guidelines on evaluating attendance areas, the \nfact is that, absent a major reformation of the attendance patterns in the entire district and a \ncomplete abandonment of the concept of neighborhood schools, the formal consideration of \nthe state guidelines would have had no effect on the selection of sites and the construction \nof these schools. \n518 F.Supp. at 630 (emphasis added). The majority also fails to consider this part of the \nWestinghouse Learning Corporation's report: \nThe consultants considered a number of possibilities wherein buildings might be located so \nas to enhance integration without bussing. There is no such possibility. In fact, the current \ncommunity or neighborhood school pattern provides the least amount of bussing for all \nstudents when compared to the educational park proposals. \n(Emphasis added.) As the district court pointed out, the Westinghouse Learning \nCorporation, the Building Master Plan Task Group, and Dr. Knight, the school district \nsuperintendent, all concluded that the only realistic solution to segregation in the school \ndistrict was some form of two-way bussing. 518 F.Supp. at 631, 637; 412 F.Supp. at 324. \n \n\n \n \nIn view of these authoritative conclusions, the Board could have concluded that any real \nprogress toward desegregation could be achieved only by abandoning the neighborhood \nschool concept. Certainly, several proposals presented to the Board assertedly would work \nwithin the neighborhood school concept. Considering the shape of the school district and \nthe extent of de facto segregation within it, however, the Board may very well have decided, \nand decided reasonably, that implementation of any, or even of all, of the proposals to \nenhance integration without bussing would have produced at most token progress toward \ndesegregation. The district court could not fault the Board for rejecting these proposals, and \nI cannot say that the court was clearly wrong in its finding. \nThe majority also argues that the school district's rejection of bussing as a means to \ndesegregate is unreasonable because it already busses one-third of its students on a daily \nbasis. Maj. op. at 669. \n678*678 Except for students with special needs such as the physically handicapped, all \nstudents who are bussed are transported only within their attendance areas. See 412 \nF.Supp. at 314-15. Equating that type of bussing with cross-town bussing for integration is \nsomewhat simplistic. In November of 1979 the voters of the State of California amended the \nstate constitution to curtail the power of state courts to remedy de facto segregation by \nordering bussing or school reassignment. Their purposes, as stated in the measure itself, \nwere: \nmaking the most effective use of the limited financial resources now and prospectively \navailable to support public education, maximizing the educational opportunities and \nprotecting the health and safety of all public school pupils, enhancing the ability of parents \nto participate in the educational process, preserving harmony and tranquility in this state \nand its public schools, preventing the waste of scarce fuel, resources, and protecting the \nenvironment. \nCrawford v. Board of Education, 458 U.S. 527, 543 n. 29, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3221 n. 29, 73 \nL.Ed.2d 948 (1982). The Supreme Court stated that these purposes \"are legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory objectives.\" Id. at 545, 102 S.Ct. at 3222. The school district, therefore, \nhad legitimate reasons for rejecting the bussing proposals. The district court so found. As \nwe are reviewing the district court's findings for clear error, I find no basis on which to \ndisagree with the district court. \nIV. Catering to a Pro-Segregation Public \nThe majority also castigates the Board for \"cater[ing] to a pro-segregation public,\" maj. op. \nat 673, and \"transforming the QUEST committee from a group of concerned citizens to one \ndominated by those opposed to desegregation.\" Id. at 675. \nIt is difficult to ignore the public's powerful and strident general opposition to bussing. A \ntypical community reaction is shown in the story of Wilson Junior High School: \n \n\n \n \n[T]he district considered transferring all Wilson Junior High School students to adjacent \nMarkham Junior High School, with only 7.2% Spanish-surnamed students. Because \nMarkham was conducting double sessions, the proposed transfer was contemplated as a \ntemporary measure pending location of a site in the southernmost portion of the northern \ndowntown core for a magnet school with a large \"integrated student body.\" However, \ncommunity opposition developed, and a parents' meeting held at Markham Junior High \nSchool indicated mass hostility to bussing students from Wilson to Markham. \n412 F.Supp. at 322. \nCommunity opposition also abounded when the Board formed QUEST. The district court \nfound that the Board agreed to open the membership of QUEST to more people under \npressure from members of the community who feared the outcome of QUEST's work. \nFurthermore, 1500 people, mostly opposed to the work of QUEST, attended the meeting at \nwhich QUEST's membership was opened. Maj. op. at 672 n. 16; 518 F.Supp. at 639; see \nalso 412 F.Supp. at 325. \nCertainly, strong community opposition was not a force to be taken lightly by the Board. As \nthe QUEST report stated: \nEven if the present school board were to adopt a plan of forced integration, it could not be \ncarried out in the face of an opposition constituting 55% of the community — let alone 82%. \nPlans adopted and laws passed can soon be repealed, and subsequent elections would \ninstall men in office intending just that. In addition, any plan would require bond issues to be \npassed by voters who oppose the plan. \nQUEST, Report to the Board of Education 93 (1970). \nSubsequent events demonstrated the correctness of the writer's observation. During the \ntime of this litigation, the Board needed voter authorization for bond issues to finance the \nconstruction of new schools. Voters rejected bond issues for this purpose 679*679 in 1969, \n1971, 1972, and 1973. 412 F.Supp. at 324-25. Moreover, in a 1972 initiative measure, \nknown as Proposition 21, voters of California repealed the state guidelines defining racial \nimbalance that were heavily relied on by the majority. See 412 F.Supp. at 327-28; Santa \nBarbara School District v. Superior Court, 13 Cal.3d 315, 530 P.2d 605, 118 Cal.Rptr. 637 \n(1975) (upholding the validity of the repealer). Finally, in 1979 the California voters \namended the Equal Protection Clause of the California Constitution to curtail court-ordered \nbussing and pupil reassignment. See Crawford v. Board of Education, 458 U.S. 527, 531-\n32, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3214-15, 73 L.Ed.2d 948 (1982). \nIn the face of this powerful opposition to forced bussing, the district court found that the \nBoard was doing the best it could in its dealings with QUEST: \n[P]rior to the \"opening up\" of the QUEST membership, there is no evidence that the Board \nattempted to direct the findings of QUEST or to otherwise interfere with its operations. To \nthe contrary, the evidence indicates that school officials did their utmost to ensure, when \nQUEST was organized and began its work, that articulate, concerned representatives of all \n \n\n \n \nsegments of the community were involved, and to ensure that those involved in QUEST \ndesired to develop proposals to integrate the school system, not to sabotage the effort.... \n[When QUEST's membership was opened up,] the Board made subsequent efforts to \nrecruit more people from other, more supportive segments of the community to join in the \neffort and to presumably counter-balance the influx of people hostile to QUEST's mission.... \n... [T]he Board's initial organization of QUEST, and the efforts both then and at the later \npoint of reconstitution [were made] to ensure that the community was well represented and \nthat persons sympathetic to the work of QUEST were in the positions of leadership in both \nthe original and reconstituted organization .... \nIndeed, the Board's persistence in seeing the work of QUEST go forward, in attempting to \nprotect it from being overwhelmed by those hostile to its work, and in continuing, despite \npressure, to encourage QUEST to formulate proposals for the integration of the district — \neven if for the long term — [supports] a finding that the Board was trying its best, in a \ndifficult situation .... \n518 F.Supp. at 639-40. I therefore cannot agree with the majority's assertion that the only \npicture of the Board emerging from the evidence shows it as only paying lip service to \nQUEST while it was actually and intentionally inimical to it and its work. \nV. The Bond Issue Elections \nThe majority regards the Board's statements in the bond issue elections as conclusive on \nthe issue of intent. See maj. op. at 672-673. As the district court pointed out, however, it is \nreasonable to view these statements differently: \nThe statements concerning the spread of double sessions and the need to transport \nstudents to the other end of the district if the various issues did not pass seem, in context, to \nbe simply realistic factual statements of the results which would flow from the failure of the \nbond issues to pass.... There is no particular emphasis given to them, nor, in context, is \nthere any suggestion that the school board meant to do anything but point to the many \nburdens which would be placed on the students and the district in general by such a failure \nof the bond issue to pass. \n518 F.Supp. at 638-39. \nSome pro-bond voters may have been motivated by a fear or dislike of Spanish-surnamed \nstudents in southern facilities; however, they may also have been motivated by a fear of \ncongestion or a multitude of other considerations. \n412 F.Supp. at 332. \nVI. Conclusion \nWhether actions that separate students racially amount to intentional segregation \"is an \nissue that can present very difficult 680*680 and subtle factual questions.\" Columbus Board \n \n\n \n \nof Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 470-71, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 2983, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979) \n(Stewart, J., concurring); see United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 338 U.S. 338, 340, 70 S.Ct. \n177, 178, 94 L.Ed. 150 (1943). To us, Judge Peckham's exhaustive and thoughtful opinion \n\"appears to represent the considered judgment of an able trial judge, after patient hearing \n....\" Yellow Cab, 338 U.S. at 341, 70 S.Ct. at 179. The majority's voluminous review of the \nevidence unfavorable to the judgment demonstrates only that the trial court would have \nbeen justified if it had reached a contrary conclusion. Under \"not clearly erroneous\" review, \nthen, I would affirm. \n[1] Indeed, where, as here, the adverse consequences are clearly identified and repeatedly articulated to the \ndecisionmaking body, the inevitability of the adverse effects provide a strong inference of illegitimate \nintent. See Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2296 n. 25, \n60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979), Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 462 n. 11, 463 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 2941, \n2949 n. 11, 2949 n. 12, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979). \nWe recognize the special difficulty inherent in determining the \"intent\" of any deliberative body such as a school \nboard: It is \"`extremely difficult for a court to ascertain the motivation, or collection of different motivations, that lie \nbehind a legislative enactment'.... Whatever difficulties exist with regard to a single statute will be compounded in a \njudicial review of years of administration of a large and complex school system.\" Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 \nU.S. 189, 233-34, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2710, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring and \ndissenting) (quoting Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224, 91 S.Ct. 1940, 1944, 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971)). \nThe difficulty is exacerbated in this case by the fact that the courts must use objective and circumstantial evidence to \nprove a subjective factor — motivation or purpose to discriminate. Discriminatory purpose, \"implies more than intent \nas violation or intent as awareness of consequences.... It implies that the decisionmaker ... selected or reaffirmed a \nparticular course of action at least in part `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable \ngroup.\" Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 (1979). \n[2] In following this policy, the Board acted in violation of California law, which prohibited adherence to a \nneighborhood school policy when neighborhoods were segregated. The California Supreme Court states, \nalthough a school board's establishment of and adherence to a \"neighborhood school policy\" may on its face \nrepresent the implementation of a \"neutral,\" constitutionally permissible classification scheme, the effect of such state \naction has invariably been to inflict a \"racially specific\" harm on minority students when such a policy actually results \nin segregated education. \nCrawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles, 17 Cal.3d 280, 294, 130 Cal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28 \n(1976). \n[3] The first \"official\" recognition of imbalance in the schools came in 1962 when the Board passed a motion \nrecognizing the problem of ethnic imbalance in the schools, and promising to take action on the subject. On January \n17, 1963, the Board passed a resolution recognizing that \"segregation of racial and ethnic minority group children ... \ncontain[s] inherent educational disadvantages for minority group children, which in turn are a root cause of social \nevils affecting the entire community life.\" Furthermore, the Board recognized that segregation \"is potentially \naggravated by the drawing of school boundaries\" and resolved to undertake a \"comprehensive study ... with the aim \nof overcoming the evils produced by such school segregation ....\" In 1964, the Board conducted its first ethnic survey \nof the schools in the district. This survey confirmed what the Board had recognized two years earlier — that the \nschools in the district were substantially imbalanced. In a 1966 report to the State Department of Education the Board \nrecognized that the District's efforts to solve the problem of segregation in the schools were not meeting the State's \nguidelines, which required \"that project proposals necessarily incorporate activities to alleviate situations where \nsegregation existed.\" In June, 1966, a consultant in the State Office of Compensatory Education stressed the \nsuggestion of \"exchange busing\" as a means of alleviating the racial imbalance. In 1968, the State Department of \nEducation advised the Board that 41 of its 50 schools were racially imbalanced by state standards. \n \n\n \n \n[4] In April, 1967, the State Board of Education sent a letter to all district superintendents informing them that State \nlaw required affirmative steps to reduce segregation in the schools, regardless of cause, citing Cal.Admin.Code, Title \n5, § 2010, 2011 and the decision of the California Supreme Court in Jackson v. Pasadena School District, 59 Cal.2d \n876, 31 Cal.Rptr. 606, 382 P.2d 878 (1963). A letter from the State Department of Education of June 21, 1968, \nreiterated the mandate of its 1967 letter, informing the District of its duty to desegregate. See also infra note 9. \n[5] Although the district court accurately outlined the changes in the state guidelines, see Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 327-\n28, the policies exemplified by those provisions are remarkably consistent through 1972. The district court cited \nseveral examples of the Board's knowing failure to comply with state requirements. See Diaz I at 328. The court \nfound that \"the board understood the statutory obligation to conduct studies and formulate alternate plans designed \ntoward reducing ethnic imbalance ....\" Id. (emphasis added). However, the court found, \"the board has never directed \nits staff to formulate alternative criteria for student assignment or to prepare a plan....\" Id. \nThe court found that the district \"advised the State Department of Education of progress toward integration through \nthe QUEST study....\" Id. However, the board limited the scope of the study [and] ... [n]o action was taken on any \nQUEST proposal.\" Id. \nThe court found that \"school districts were required to consider the impact of site selection on ethnic composition of \nexisting schools....\" Id. However, the court found that \"the district has not applied the state's checklist for improved \nethnic balance\" in siting the Anglo schools. Id. \n[6] In 1968 the Santa Clara County Office of Education issued a report entitled \"Improving Ethnic Balance and \nIntergroup Relations,\" prepared by Edwin T. Rios, a consultant hired by the County. \nThis report recommended two-way busing to relieve ethnic imbalance, as well as revision in curriculum, staff, training \nand community relations. The report recognizes and stresses that under state laws at that time \"school districts have \na legal obligation to take reasonable affirmative steps to prevent the segregation of students in schools by \nrace, regardless of the cause of segregation, and to consider the ethnic composition of a school in determining its \nattendance boundaries.\" \nOn February 3, 1969, Superintendent Downing sent a letter to the Board discussing the Rios report and \nrecommending the formation of a citizen's committee to study the problem of ethnic imbalance and make \nrecommendations for solving the problem. He stated that \"the school system must reinforce its efforts to provide for \nall students high quality integrated education. The district must avail itself of every avenue of approach in order to \nachieve this objective.\" Downing further stated, \nThe San Jose Unified School District, one of the largest in the county, has a heavy concentration of Mexican-\nAmerican students. A racial-ethnic survey conducted in October of 1968 reports that 9,834 or 27.9% of the student \npopulation is Mexican-American. Of this number 7,226 are concentrated in 14 of the district's elementary schools, \nthree junior high schools, and one senior high school. In these 18 schools the percentage of Mexican-American \nstudents ranges from 44% to 92% of the student body. \n[7] In suggesting that by some sleight of hand we transform a violation of state law to a per se violation of federal law, \nthe dissent misperceives the significance we attach to the Board's failure to conform to state requirements. The entire \nfocus of our opinion is to determine whether the district court was correct in finding that the Board lacked segregative \nintent. The inquiry is a factual one. We find the Board's actions (and inactions) leading to known segregative \nconsequences in the face of its affirmative state duty to desegregate probative evidence of intent. \nDespite the protestations of the dissent to the contrary, it concedes the probative value of such evidence when it \nacknowledges that \"[i]naction in the face of an affirmative duty to desegregate may support a higher probability of \ndiscriminatory intent than does inaction when no such duty exists.\" Dissent at 676. The record is replete with \nevidence of the Board's knowing failure to act in accordance with state law. Such circumstantial evidence is \nconsidered along with the other evidence in the case in determining whether the Board acted with segregative intent. \nWe do not suggest that the Board's violation of its duties under state law is in and of itself a violation of federal law, \nnor do we suggest that violation of state law may be redressed in federal court. See Pennhurst State School & \nHospital v. Halderman, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 900, 919, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). \n \n\n \n \n[8] The district court provided the following table: \n                             Percentage             Percentage \n                  Year       Spanish-surnamed       Spanish-surnamed \nSchool            Opened     When Opened            In 1973 \n \nWilliams          1968           2.2                    1.4 \n(elementary) \n \nHenderson         1966           5.4                    1.5 \n(elementary) \n \nSimonds           1966           1.7                    2.7 \n(elementary) \n \nBret Harte        1966           7.0                    3.4 \n(Jr. high) \n \nLeland (high)     1967           5.1                    3.4 \n \nAllen             1965          14.6                    4.7 \n(elementary) \n \nErickson          1968           9.4                    6.4 \n(elementary) \n \nHammer            1966          13.7                    6.6 \n(elementary) \n \nTerrell           1966          20.8                    7.7 \n(elementary) \nDiaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 317. \n[9] The district court found: \nAlthough the board has been aware of Title 5 requirements and has realized that adherence to a neighborhood \nschool policy presents an obstacle to desegregation, the board has never directed its staff to formulate alternative \ncriteria for student assignment or to prepare a plan for district-wide integration. \n* * * * * * \nUnder Title 5, school districts were required to consider the impact of site selection on ethnic composition of existing \nschools in adjacent areas. In selecting sites for new facilities in the Anglo suburban area, the district has not applied \nthe state's checklist for improved ethnic balance. \nDiaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 328 (emphasis added). \n[10] The Field Act provides minimum standards for public schools to withstand earthquakes. See Cal.Educ.Code §§ \n39140, 81130 (West 1978). The 1967 amendments to the Education Code required inspection of all school buildings \nby 1970. Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 317. \n[11] In November of 1971 the district court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the construction of eleven \nschools pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction. In December of that same year the district court lifted the \n \n\n \n \ntemporary restraining order and declined to issue a preliminary injunction because it found that plaintiffs had failed to \nshow a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits. See Diaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 311-12. \nThe district court informed the Board in very strong terms at this time that its decision was not to be interpreted by the \nBoard to constitute judicial approval of the Board's decision to go forward with the reconstruction of the schools. The \ndistrict court (and the School Board) had before it overwhelming and clear evidence that those schools would open as \nracially imbalanced schools and that rebuilding the schools in another location could reduce the racial imbalance in \nthe District. Nonetheless, the district court viewed this as part of the possible remedy in the event unconstitutional \nsegregation was found and felt that it could not enjoin it absent more compelling proof of a constitutional violation. \nThe Board made its choice to proceed with reconstruction in spite of the district court's clear and repeated \nadmonitions that it was possible that the only remaining remedy available to the court would be busing. \n[12] One opportunity to reduce segregation is particularly noteworthy: \nFaced with overcrowding at Pioneer High School, a southern suburban facility with a 5.7% Spanish-surnamed \npopulation, the board transferred students to Leland High School, an adjacent southern facility with a 4.1% Spanish-\nsurnamed population. Increased ethnic balance would have resulted from board action transferring the Pioneer \nstudents to San Jose High School, a northeastern facility separated from Pioneer by the bordering Willow Glen \nattendance area. Although San Jose High School, with a 59.6% Spanish-surnamed student enrollment, was \noperating undercapacity, the district failed to transport any Pioneer students to San Jose High School. \nDiaz I, 412 F.Supp. at 323. \n[13] On August 31, 1966, the Office of Compensatory Education informed the district that their integration statement \n\"did not meet the intent of the requirement in the [Federal/State Guidelines] nor was it an `appropriate approach' \ninsofar as the utilization of Federal funds was concerned.\" The Board's report to the State recognized that, as of \nAugust 31, 1966, \"the district's orientation and that of the ... Office of Compensatory Education were again, \ndivergent.\" The Board recognized that it had been subject to \"considerable pressure\" to alter its neighborhood school \nconcept. Two repeated suggestions for change had been alteration of attendance boundaries and a one or two-way \nbusing program. The report analyzed the costs of such an \"exchange busing\" at from $233,100 to $359,100 \ndepending on the level of balance sought. See also supra notes 3-6. \n[14] On August 5, 1965, the Board adopted policy # 5007.1 in which the Board promised to establish attendance \nareas to eliminate segregation in its schools in accordance with Title 5 of the California Administrative Code. The \nstatement provided: \nEstablishment of Attendance Areas \nIn establishing attendance areas for each regular day school maintained, it is the intent of the Board of Education to \ncomply with Article 3, Section 14020, California Administrative Code, Title 5, Education, to the fullest extent to avoid \nthe ultimate result of segregation of pupils by ethnic or racial composition. \nArticle 3, Section 14020. State Board Policy. Attendance Areas and Practices. \"It is the declared policy of the State \nBoard of Education that persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of school attendance centers or the \nassignment of pupils thereto shall exert all effort to prevent and eliminate racial and ethnic imbalance in pupil \nenrollment. The prevention and elimination of such imbalance shall be given high priority in all decisions relating to \nschool sites, school attendance areas and school attendance practices.\" \n[15] The modified mandate stated: \nOn the problem as a whole, however, it is our preliminary judgment that as between the broad areas of instructional \nprogram on the one hand and achieving racial and ethnic balance on the other for the near term priority should be \ngiven to the instructional program. We are motivated in this by the belief that the hoped-for benefits of racial and \nethnic balance in the schools will not be achieved unless revisions have been made in the instructional program, the \ngrouping of students and the training of teachers to make the entire school experience more responsive to the needs \nof all elements of our community. Simply stated, a racially balanced school is not necessarily an integrated one and \n \n\n \n \ndoes not necessarily provide a quality education. For the long term, we feel that priority should be placed on \nachieving racial and ethnic balance in our schools to the fullest extent possible within our means as it is to us an \nessential component of quality integrated education. Finally, we wish to restate our overall philosophy that we are \ncommitted to serving the needs of this community. And as in the past, this Board would not voluntarily adopt a \nprogram which it had reason to believe the community had not participated in or would not support. \nId. \n[16] The final QUEST report supplies a useful and informative summary of the sequence of events outlined by the \nevidence. This report is supported by testimony at trial. \nThe first progress report was presented to the Board of Education at its meeting of October 16, 1969.... \nThe chairman prepared an \"Introduction to QUEST\" for distribution to the schools on November 25, 1969. The \nemotional aspect of the problem was thrust forward, not by what the Introduction said, but rather by what it did not \nsay. Phones rang incessantly. Rumors ran rampart [sic]. \"You're not going to bus my child anywhere!\" \"Who are you \npeople on the committee?\" \"Are you from Berkeley?\" \"What is the problem?\" \"Why haven't we heard about QUEST \nbefore now?\" For two months, fear and apprehension overruled reason, although several public appearances were \nmade by QUEST members to explain. This set the stage for the Board's meeting of February 5, 1970, at which time a \nprogress report of QUEST was scheduled. More than 1500 people attended. The main points of that progress report \nwere that a Student Advisory Committee had been established under the guidance and direction of Mr. David Curry, \nGeneral Vice-chairman, consisting of students from the junior and senior high schools; that no recommendation for \nbusing any students to correct imbalance had been made by the Demographic Task Force; that the task forces had \nbeen primarily involved in orientation and education; and that QUEST proposed hiring an Intergroup Relations \nSpecialist. (See copy of recommendation at the end of this section.) Almost a year later, February 1970 — December \n1970, no action has been taken on the latter recommendation. \nThe meeting was a disaster in terms of the unusual display of emotionalism. It was unfortunate because of the lack of \nunderstanding and appreciation of the nature of QUEST's task. Finally, the meeting was tragic and predictable \nbecause of the fear and racism expressed. This culminated in an open invitation [by the Board] to those present to \nbecome members of QUEST. Thus, an opportunity for greater community participation was granted at the expense of \nalienating an already dedicated group of citizens. QUEST was consequently reconstituted, and many of the alienated \nmembers resigned. Others later resigned for different reasons, principally over disagreement with the proposed \nstructure. \nThe newly constituted QUEST, as organized and approved by the Board of Education, received its new charge [from \nthe Board] in March, 1970. The study was to encompass a long range goal to a quality integrated education, and a \nshort range goal to quality educational components.... \n* * * * * * \nAs the work of the task forces progressed, it was apparent that another period of orientation and education was a \nnecessary preliminary to any effective work. The level of politial machinations that followed were alien to our \norientation as one task force in particular, Site Location and Usage, pursued a course of \"benign racism\". Many \nmembers of that committee consciously and subconsciously either denied the existence of a problem or explained it \naway with an almost fanatical adherence to the so-called \"neighborhood school concept\". This approach persisted \neven though the task force chairman, Art Ryder, prepared an excellent outline of study more appropriate to that task \nforce's specified charge. At least one member attached [sic] QUEST's leadership as having a \"dominant theme of \nsudden change or experimentation ... which ... must be challenged when it places the membership in a position of \ndisrepute in the community.\" The fact of the matter was that this QUEST member was an integral part of QUEST's \nleadership. This was one of many examples of the kind of paranoia that raised its ugly head much too often. \n* * * * * * \nThe contrast between the divisive and unifying forces is clearly demonstrated in the number and quality of the final \nrecommendations. While some worked in earnest, others connived, schemed and attacked. \n \n\n \n \n* * * * * * \nThe Executive Committee of QUEST voted to suspend activities to coincide with the November 19, 1970 Board \nannouncement of a tax and bond election. Many members were happy about this decision because it meant an end \nto meetings and a greater assurance of a successful tax and bond election. Others were disappointed because much \nunfinished work had to be done and the decision was being based on reaction to an undetermined size of dissidents \nin the community. \nThe Board happily acquiesced in this decision and promised to review the final recommendations of QUEST in time \nto be included in the tax and bond announcement by November 19, 1970. The trust and faith in the honorable \nintentions of the Board were once again questioned as the Board allotted no time during its work sessions to consider \nQUEST's recommendations. January, 1971, was set as the new date for QUEST work sessions to begin. \nA grave redundancy deserves mentioning at this point. The Board plans to submit QUEST's final report to interested \npersons and organizations in the community for study and comments before taking any action. A citizens' report \nsubmitted to other citizens who will perhaps re-study and submit a report is a kind of buck-passing, repetitive cop-out \nthat only a Board committed to maintaining the status quo can, in good conscience, do. The original structure of \nQUEST made provision for additional community involvement, but the abrupt ending prevented this from being \naccomplished. \nRedundancy, mistrust, delaying tactics, etc. were part and parcel of the inability of QUEST to attract and hold \nMexican-American citizens as active participants. The schools of this district must share, on part, the blame for the \nscarcity in leadership among Mexican-Americans. \n[17] We do not find the fact that the bond issues failed as any mitigation of the effect of this evidence, for we are \nlooking for evidence of the Board's state of mind. Whether the voters were wiser or the Board was insufficiently \npersuasive, our conclusion remains the same. \n[18] In Columbus, the Supreme Court emphasized that the Board of Education had received many recommendations \nover the years that would have alleviated some of the segregation in the Columbus system; the school board \nconsistently refused to follow up on any of those recommendations. These failures to act were particularly important \nbecause \"the Columbus system grew rapidly in terms of geography and number of students, creating many \ncrossroads where the Board could either turn toward segregation or away from it.\" 443 U.S. at 463 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at \n2949 n. 12. The Supreme Court upheld the district court's inference of segregative intent \"`from the Columbus \ndefendants' failure after notice, to consider predictable racial consequences of their acts and omissions when \nalternatives were available which would have eliminated or lessened racial imbalance.'\" Id. (quoting 429 F.Supp. 229, \n240 (S.D.Ohio 1977)). \n[19] 103 new schools had been built in Columbus; 87 opened with student bodies that were predominantly of one \nrace. The Court noted that this segregative result was \"reasonably foreseeable under the circumstance in light of the \nsites selected.\" Columbus, 443 U.S. at 462 n. 11, 99 S.Ct. at 2949 n. 11. It went on to note, however, that it did not \nrely on an inference of discriminatory purpose based on the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the district's \nactions because the record reflected that the school board had been warned about the segregative consequences of \nits actions, and that alternatives had been proposed that would have increased integration. Id. Similarly, in Dayton \nBoard of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979), \"22 of 24 new schools, 78 of \n95 additions, and all 26 portable schools built ... opened virtually all black or all white.\" 443 U.S. at 533 n. 7, 99 S.Ct. \nat 2977 n. 7. \n \n ",

They \ncharge that the San Jose Unified School District (\"district\"), its superintendent, and the \nmembers of its Board of Education (\"school board\") maintained racially imbalanced schools \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. After a hearing on the merits, the district court \nfound that the school district was racially imbalanced and that the appellees created or \nmaintained the ethnic imbalance, but that in so doing the appellees did not act with \n\"segregative intent,\" as that term has been construed by the United States Supreme Court \nand this court. The issue on appeal is whether the district court applied the correct criteria in \ndeciding the segregative intent issue. We vacate and remand the case to the district court \nfor reconsideration in the light of Columbus Board of Education v. Penick (1979) ___ U.S. \n___, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 61 413*413 L.Ed.2d 666; Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman (1979) \n___ U.S. ___, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720; and the views herein expressed. \n  1 \n\n \n \nThe district court's opinion sets forth the factual background of the controversy. (Diaz v. San \nJose Unified School District (N.D.Cal.1976) 412 F.Supp. 310.) We briefly summarize the \npertinent facts. \nThe challenged school district runs from north to south through central San Jose, California. \nThe district is 16 miles long and from one and one-half to four miles wide. The Spanish-\nsurnamed population is concentrated in the downtown area in the northern part of the \ndistrict. The Anglo residents are primarily in the southern part of the district, a suburban \narea. The Spanish-surnamed students make up 24.6 percent of the total student population \nof the district. In the northern area, the student population is 60.5 percent Spanish-\nsurnamed, representing 78.8 percent of the Spanish-surnamed school children in the \ndistrict. The student population of the southern-suburban schools is .07 percent Spanish-\nsurnamed. No statutorily mandated \"dual system\" of segregated schools has ever existed in \nthe district. \nFor many years, the district adhered to a \"neighborhood policy,\" under which students are \nrequired to attend schools within designated \"attendance areas\" in which they reside. \nAlthough the goal of the policy is to allow students to attend schools within walking distance \nof their homes, extensive transportation of the students in the district is used, but \ntransportation is only within attendance areas. \nAppellees knew, at least as early as 1962, that the district was racially imbalanced. At that \ntime, the school board passed a resolution acknowledging that segregation was inherently \nharmful. Following state requirements, the school board conducted annual ethnic surveys \nbeginning in 1966 which disclosed a continuing pattern of racial imbalance. The school \nboard reaffirmed its commitment to racial integration in a policy statement issued in 1970. \nSince 1965, appellees have undertaken a whole series of actions that maintained the racial \nimbalance of the district. It also omitted courses of action, readily available to it, that would \nhave ameliorated racial imbalance. Since 1965, the school district has built nine new \nschools on newly-selected sites. All nine opened as racially imbalanced schools. The district \nfollowed state guidelines regarding racial balance in selecting sites in the northern \ndowntown area, but it did not consider the guidelines in choosing sites in the suburban area. \nPursuant to state legislation setting minimum safety standards for schools, the district \nregularly conducted inspections of all schools. In 1967, the inspections revealed that \nnumerous school buildings in the district failed to meet state safety requirements. After the \nLos Angeles earthquake in February, 1971, the school board voted to close all unsafe \nschools at the end of the 1971 school year. Pending reconstruction of the buildings, classes \nwere held in portable classrooms. The school board decided to rebuild most of the unsafe \ndowntown schools on their original sites; no attendance boundaries were changed. Ten of \nthe rebuilt schools were racially imbalanced in 1971, and that condition remained \nunchanged after reconstruction. Only two schools were balanced in 1971; they remained \nbalanced thereafter. Only two schools were rebuilt on different sites; both of those schools \nwere imbalanced both before and after reconstruction. The school board did not consider \nthe impact of reconstruction on existing ethnic imbalance, and it rejected suggestions for \nrebuilding that would have improved ethnic balance. \n  2 \n\n \n \nSeven of the schools which were closed for failure to meet safety standards were not \nrebuilt. In reassigning students from the closed schools, ethnic balance was improved from \nthe point of view of the reassigned students, although the ethnic balance at receiving \nschools was sometimes worsened. Reassignments were made solely to contiguous \nattendance areas. \nThe school district owns over 400 portable classrooms, which are distributed to \nschools 414*414 on the basis of the individual needs of those schools. The district created \nseven down-town schools entirely from portables. The school board did not consider using \nthose portable classrooms in a manner to improve ethnic balance. Rather, in response to \nover-crowding in southern schools, the school board put those schools on double sessions \npending construction of new schools. Although the school board recognized that double \nsessions are educationally undesirable, it did not transport students from the overcrowded \nsouthern schools to the underused northern schools. Although some students were \ntransferred to other schools within the southern area, none were transported to non-\nadjacent schools. The board was fully aware that any improvement in racial imbalance \ncould not be achieved without district-wide bussing. The board nevertheless repeatedly \ndeclared itself opposed to bussing for the purpose of integration. In 1963, the board passed \na resolution assuring the community of its opposition to bussing for integration, and it has \nnever deviated from this position. \nAs all parties recognize, when no statutory dual system has ever existed, appellants \"must \nprove not only that segregated schooling exists but also that it was brought about or \nmaintained by intentional state action.\" (Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973), 413 U.S. \n189, 198, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2692, 37 L.Ed.2d 548; Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, \nsupra, ___ U.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. 2941.) The district court succinctly summarized the \nappellants' contention: \"To prove that defendants have operated a segregated school \nsystem in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, plaintiffs first established that the board \nwas fully aware of the existing racial imbalance in the district, and then attempted to \ndemonstrate that ethnic imbalance resulted from defendants' intentional conduct. To prove \nsegregative intent, plaintiffs introduced evidence of the district's educational policies on (1) \nsite selection and school construction; (2) adoption of a neighborhood school policy with \nboard-designated attendance areas; (3) reconstruction of Field Act schools; (4) school \nclosures and student reassignments; (5) location of portable classrooms and maintenance \nof double sessions; (6) student transportation; (7) presentation of materials supporting bond \nelections; (8) response to integration proposals by a citizens' committee; (9) faculty and \nstaff assignments and (10) failure to integrate despite a state statutory duty and a publicly-\nissued board policy to relieve ethnic imbalance.\" (Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, \nsupra, 412 F.Supp. at 315.) \nThe impact of these acts and policies of the appellees exacerbated the racial imbalance in a \nnumber of schools within the district and improved racial balance in none of them. \n\"Adherence to a particular policy or practice, `with full knowledge of the predictable effects \nof such adherence upon racial imbalance in a school system is one factor among many \nothers which may be considered by a court in determining whether an inference of \nsegregative intent should be drawn.'\" (Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, supra, ___ \nU.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. at 2950.) \n  3 \n\n \n \nTo contradict the adverse inferences arising from the appellants' proof, appellees relied \nsolely on their consistent adherence to a neighborhood school policy, which was racially \nneutral. The district court concluded that consistent adherence to a neighborhood school \npolicy was enough, standing alone, to dispel inferences of segregative intent that arose \nfrom the combination of actions and inactions of the appellees resulting in the racial \nimbalance of which appellants complained. \nThe district court explained: \"The critical issue in this litigation is thus whether a school \nboard may apply a neighborhood school policy.\" (Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, \nsupra, 412 F.Supp. at 334.) \"The evidence shows that defendant School District has \nadhered to a `neighborhood school policy,' with the result that ethnic composition of the \nschools merely reflects residential patterns.\" (Id. at 312.) \"If, however, neutral adherence to \na neighborhood school policy is constitutional, this court has no authority to intervene \nand 415*415 order integration.\" (Id. at 334.) Thus, as we read the district court's opinion, the \ndistrict court concluded that the existence of consistently followed neighborhood school \npolicy constituted either a complete defense to a charge of segregative intent, or, \ncompletely dispelled the inferences of segregative intent that flowed from the appellants' \nproof. \nWe disagree with the district court's characterization of the issue, and, in the light \nof Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, supra, we do not believe that a neighborhood \nschool policy, no matter how consistently followed, can be a determinative fact in proving \nthe ultimate fact of forbidden purpose.[1] As usual in a case in which subjective intent is an \nessential element, existence of that intent can ordinarily be established only by \ncircumstantial evidence. An inference of segregative intent arose from the appellants' proof. \nAppellees' proof that they consistently followed a long-established policy of neighborhood \nschools is merely relevant evidence to be taken into account in deciding whether the \nforbidden intent did or did not exist. Moreover, proof of such a policy, under all of the facts \nand circumstances of a case, may be of slight relevancy or none at all. \nA neighborhood school policy is not constitutionally suspect. Such a policy does not have \nconstitutional implications one way or the other without a penetrating examination of the \ncomplete context in which the neighborhood policy was initially applied and subsequently \nenforced. Thus, for example, a decision to build a new school in a neighborhood that is \nentirely white, or entirely Hispanic, is not simply an enforcement of a neighborhood school \npolicy. Location of the school, itself, affects the neighborhood. As the Supreme Court \nobserved in Keyes v. School District No. 1, supra, 413 U.S. at 201-02, 93 S.Ct. at 2694: \n\"[T]he practice of building a school .. to a certain size and in a certain location, `with \nconscious knowledge that it would be a segregated school,' ... has a substantial reciprocal \neffect on the racial composition of other nearby schools. So also, the use of mobile \nclassrooms, the drafting of student transfer policies, the transportation of students, and the \nassignment of faculty and staff, on racially identifiable bases, have the clear effect of \nearmarking schools according to their racial composition, and this, in turn, together with the \nelements of student assignment and school construction, may have a profound reciprocal \neffect on the racial composition of residential neighborhoods within a metropolitan area, \nthereby causing further racial concentration within the schools.\" \n  4 \n\n \n \nIn short, discriminatory intent may motivate the building of a school in a particular location, \nand that intent is not dispelled by proof that all students in a district were required to attend \nneighborhood schools. \nSchool closures may be fully justified by many factors which are untainted by forbidden \nmotivations. But school closures cannot be justified by neighborhood school policies. The \nobvious effect of a closure is to remove a neighborhood school. Similarly, the building of a \nnew school may be undertaken for many reasons that have no racial overtones, but new \nschool construction is not a function of a neighborhood school policy, although it obviously \naffects attendance patterns in the neighborhood in which the school is located and it may \nalso have a reciprocal effect upon attendance 416*416 patterns in other schools within the \ndistrict. As the Supreme Court observed in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation (1971) 402 U.S. 1, 20-21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1278, 1279, 28 L.Ed.2d 554: \n\"The construction of new schools and the closing of old ones are two of the most important \nfunctions of local school authorities and also two of the most complex. They must decide \nquestions of location and capacity in light of population growth, finances, land values, site \navailability, through an almost endless list of factors to be considered. The result of this will \nbe a decision which, when combined with one technique or another of student assignment, \nwill determine the racial composition of the student body in each school in the system. Over \nthe long run, the consequences of the choices will be far reaching. People gravitate toward \nschool facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location \nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development of a metropolitan area \nand have important impact on composition of innercity neighborhoods. \n\"In the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or \nmaintaining a state-segregated school system. In addition to the classic pattern of building \nschools specifically intended for Negro or white students, school authorities have \nsometimes, since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to become racially mixed \nthrough changes in neighborhood residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied \nby building new schools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro \npopulation centers in order to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum \ndeparture from the formal principles of `neighborhood zoning.' . . \n\"In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school segregation, the existence of a \npattern of school construction and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight.\" \nStrict adherence to a neighborhood policy is no more than circumstantial evidence that \nbears upon the existence or nonexistence of segregative intent. The existence of such a \npolicy is not enough to prove the absence of segregative intent. We remand the case to the \ndistrict court for reconsideration in the light of Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, \nsupra, Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, supra, and the views herein expressed.[2] \nThe judgment is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with the views herein expressed. \nRUSSELL E. SMITH, District Judge (dissenting): \nI respectfully dissent. \n  5 \n\n \n \nIn a painstaking opinion (Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 412 F.Supp. 310 \n(N.D.Cal.1976)) the district judge discussed, under subheads A-J inclusive, all of the facts \non which appellant relied to establish an intent to segregate. The district judge then made \ntwo express findings: first, \"The court finds that the district has consistently adhered to a \nneighborhood school policy\"; and second, \"The board has applied this policy neutrally.\" 412 \nF.Supp. at 334. The district judge then made the ultimate finding of fact: \"The court finds \nthat defendants, who consistently adhered to a neighborhood school policy, have never \nacted with segregative intent.\" 412 F.Supp. at 335. I do not think that the judge did find, or \nthat he could have found, that the Board applied the policy neutrally without considering all \nof the evidence so carefully detailed by him. In short, I think the district court did what the \nremand tells him to do. \nI would affirm. \n[*] Honorable Russell E. Smith, United States District Judge, District of Montana, sitting by designation. \n[1] Because both sides presented evidence directed to the segregative intent issue, the district court was not faced \nwith the question whether appellants' evidence made out a prima facie case of segregative intent. Contrast Keyes v. \nSchool District No. 1, supra, 413 U.S. at 209, 93 S.Ct. 2686; Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees (9th \nCir.1973) 488 F.2d 579. For the same reason, we have no occasion to reach the question whether appellants' \nevidence placed upon the appellees the burden of justifying their conduct and whether failure to do so would require \njudgment in the appellants' favor. See, e. g., Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. \n2971; Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 99 S.Ct. 2941; Keyes v. School District No. 1, \nsupra, 413 U.S. at 209, 93 S.Ct. 2686. \n[2] We do not wish to be understood as indicating any opinion on the relative weight of any or all of the evidence that \nhas been submitted; rather, our decision is confined to the determination of law that conclusive or dispositive effect \ncannot be given to a consistently followed, facially neutral, neighborhood school policy. \n \n  6 ",

Rice, San Jose, Cal., for plaintiffs-appellants. \n1130*1130 Before KASHIWA,[*] ANDERSON, and FARRIS, Circuit Judges. \nJ. BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge: \nPlaintiffs, parents of Spanish-surnamed children attending public school in the San Jose \nUnified School District, filed this class action on behalf of themselves and all other parents \nof children similarly situated. The complaint charged that defendants were operating a \nsegregated public school system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and sought \ndesegregation of the school district. The district court found that the school district was \nracially imbalanced and that the imbalance had been maintained by defendants. No liability \nattached, however, because the court decided defendants acted without segregative \nintent. Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 412 F.Supp. 310 (N.D.Cal.1976). \nIn a previous appeal, this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, reasoning \nthat the district court's decision suggested the school district's racially-neutral neighborhood \nschool policy \"constituted either a complete defense to the charge of segregative intent, or, \ncompletely dispelled the inferences of segregative intent that flowed from the [plaintiffs'] \nproof.\" Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 612 F.2d 411, 415 (9th Cir.1979). We went \non to hold that, in light of Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 99 S.Ct. \n2941, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979), and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, \n99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979), defendants' neighborhood school policy could not be \n\ndeterminative of the lack of segregative intent, but rather was \"merely relevant evidence to \nbe taken into account in deciding whether the forbidden intent did or did not exist.\" Id. With \nthe caveat that we were expressing no opinion on the relative weight of the evidence, id. at \n416 n. 2, this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings in light of Columbus, \nDayton, and the principles espoused in our opinion. Id. at 416. \nOn remand, the district court analyzed Columbus and Dayton, this court's opinion, and three \nsubsequent Supreme Court decisions, and carefully reconsidered the evidence in light \nthereof. Diaz v. San Jose Unified School District, 518 F.Supp. 622 (N.D.Cal.1981). Once \nagain, the court found insufficient evidence to support a finding of segregative intent. \nBecause the district court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous and because the \nproper legal principles were correctly applied to the facts, we affirm. \nI. THE DISTRICT COURT'S FINDINGS \nTo avoid repeating the fact statements in the three prior reported opinions, only a very brief \nsummary of the facts is presented here. The parties have always agreed that because no \nstatutory dual system of schools has ever existed, plaintiffs \"must prove not only that \nsegregated schooling exists but also that it was brought about or maintained by intentional \nstate action.\" Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 198, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2692, 37 \nL.Ed.2d 548, 557 (1973). Accord Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 238-48, 96 S.Ct. \n2040, 2046-52, 48 L.Ed.2d 597, 606-612 (1976). It is undisputed that since at least 1962, \ndefendants have known the school district was racially imbalanced and since approximately \n1965, defendants have implemented a series of policy decisions whose cumulative effect \nhas been to maintain the imbalance. Those decisions involve (1) site selection and school \nconstruction; (2) adoption of a neighborhood school policy with board-designated \nattendance areas; (3) reconstruction of Field Act Schools; (4) school closures and student \nreassignments; (5) location of portable classrooms and maintenance of double sessions; (6) \nstudent transportation; (7) presentation of materials supporting bond elections; (8) response \nto integration proposals by citizens' committee; (9) faculty and staff assignments; and (10) \nfailure to 1131*1131 integrate despite a state statutory duty and a publicly-issued board \npolicy to relieve ethnic imbalance. 412 F.Supp. at 315. \nWhat is disputed is the existence of segregative intent, a factual matter to be reviewed for \n\"clear error.\" Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 \n(1982); Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 534, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 2977, 61 \nL.Ed.2d 720, 731 (1979). In an effort to prove segregative intent, plaintiffs' approach \nthroughout this litigation has been to focus on the foregoing policy decisions in an attempt to \nestablish that each was supported by little or no educational justification. Plaintiffs were \nunable to persuade the district court of the lack of educational justification; indeed, the \ndistrict court found that in each instance, there were reasonable and rational explanations \nfor the decisions. We do not believe it is either necessary or useful to again discuss each \nchallenged action or failure to act. With respect to many of the policy decisions, plaintiffs' \nbrief merely repeats and reviews the evidence presented below and argues that the district \ncourt's rationale on remand falls squarely back on the neighborhood school justification. We \nread the district court's opinion differently. Rather than taking the neighborhood school \npolicy at face value, the district court sensitively and thoughtfully examined the historical \nand demographic underpinnings of the policy as it has been applied in the San Jose Unified \n\nSchool District. That analysis reveals that it was not slavish adherence to the neighborhood \nschool policy that produced the racial imbalance, nor did adherence to the policy raise an \ninference of segregative intent or in all respects dispel such an inference otherwise raised. \nThe neighborhood school policy was properly considered as one factor, among many, that \ndispels the inference of segregative intent. We believe the district court's opinion articulates \nadequate bases, apart from the neighborhood school policy, for all of its findings of fact, and \nplaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that those findings are clearly \nerroneous. We do, however, find it necessary to discuss three fresh arguments interposed \nby plaintiffs. These concern transportation, faculty-staff assignments, and the state-imposed \nduty to integrate. \nII. TRANSPORTATION \nAs the district court explained, the San Jose Unified School District uses a great deal of \nbusing, \"both in terms of the number of students being transported (approximately one-third \nof the student population) and in terms of the money expended (over $850,000 per \nyear).\" 518 F.Supp. at 636. The district court found that the vast majority of busing occurs \nwithin attendance areas; however, transportation outside attendance areas is quite \ncommonly used for special schools and programs. Id. The district court further found that \nschool officials were aware the school district could not be integrated without busing, yet \nofficials remained adamantly opposed to busing for purposes of integration. Id. at 637. \nPlaintiffs have used the foregoing findings to construct two arguments. First, plaintiffs \ncontend that, in the face of school officials' knowledge that the district would probably \nremain segregated without some form of busing, the consistent refusal to consider busing is \ncompelling evidence of segregative intent. The district court found, however, that although \nthis evidence was \"particularly disturbing,\" when viewed in context along with all the other \nevidence it would not support a finding of segregative intent. Id. at 637-38. This court is no \nless disturbed by defendants' unwillingness to consider busing as a means of alleviating the \nracial imbalance. The issue is close, but the district judge weighed the evidence carefully \nand his findings are well-reasoned. Applying the very narrow standard of review articulated \nby the Supreme Court in Pullman Standard v. Swint, we are not prepared to say the district \ncourt clearly erred in finding the evidence insufficient to show segregative intent. \nPlaintiffs' second argument relies on an opinion of this court recently affirmed by the \nSupreme Court, Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, ___ U.S. ___, \n102 1132*1132 S.Ct. 3187, 73 L.Ed.2d 896 (1982). Plaintiffs contend that defendants' policy \nof using wide-scale busing for numerous purposes, but not for integration, draws the same \nsort of impermissible racial classification that was condemned in Seattle School District No. \n1. We disagree. \nIn Seattle School District No. 1, Washington voters approved an initiative that sought to \nprohibit \"direct or indirect\" student assignments to a school other than the one \n\"geographically nearest or next nearest the student's place of residence . . . and which \noffers the course of study pursued by such student.\" See Wash.Rev.Code § 28A.26.010 \n(1981). The initiative contains such broad exceptions,[1] however, that it became evident the \nmeasure was directed solely at desegregative busing. The district court so found.[2] \n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with this court and the district court that the initiative drew a \nracial classification because it prohibited school districts from acting only in matters \ninvolving racial criteria. Id. at ___, 102 S.Ct. at 3195-96, 73 L.Ed.2d at 907-908. Relying on \nthe principle enunciated in Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 89 S.Ct. 557, 21 L.Ed.2d 616 \n(1969), and Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F.Supp. 710 (W.D.N.Y.1970), the Court struck down the \ninitiative as an unconstitutional attempt to restructure the political process to place obstacles \nin the path of racial minorities. As the Court explained, \"In the absence of a constitutional \nviolation, the desirability and efficacy of school desegregation are matters to be resolved \nthrough the political process. For present purposes, it is enough that minorities may \nconsider busing for integration to be `legislation that is in their interest,'\" and an initiative \nthat restructures the political process so as to bar minorities from achieving such legislation \ncannot stand under the Fourteenth Amendment. ___ U.S. at ___, 102 S.Ct. at 3197, 73 \nL.Ed.2d at 909. \nThe distinction from our case is apparent. We have been cited to no legislation in California \nthat disrupts or interferes in any way with the decision-making authority of school \ndistricts.[3] Indeed, the basis for plaintiffs' complaint is entirely inconsistent with the theory \nadvanced in Seattle School District No. 1. Plaintiffs contend, in essence, that the San Jose \nUnified School District enjoys entirely too much discretion in desegregation matters, in that \nthe district has consistently refused to revise its policy on busing for integration. But \nbecause the school district's policy does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, plaintiffs' \nonly recourse is the political process which, in contrast to the process examined in Seattle \nSchool District No. 1, remains entirely open to them. \nIII. FACULTY-STAFF ASSIGNMENTS \nAt trial, school district officials conceded that Spanish-surnamed teachers were assigned to \npredominantly Spanish-surname schools. The officials claimed that the assignments were \nfor educational purposes, 1133*1133 such as providing role models for students and making \nSpanish-speaking teachers available. Due to lack of evidence, however, the district court \nwas unable to conclude that the disproportionate assignment of Spanish-surnamed \nteachers and staff resulted from those racially-neutral purposes. 518 F.Supp. at 641. \nOn appeal, plaintiffs characterize the district court's discussion as a finding that defendants' \nfaculty-staff assignment policies were unconstitutional. Citing Fed.R. Civ.P. 15(b), plaintiffs \nrequest this court to remand with instructions to allow an amended complaint in light of the \nevidence adduced at trial on this \"unconstitutional\" practice. We believe the district court's \nopinion makes clear that the faculty-staff issue was not tried independently, but only as an \nelement of evidence to prove segregative intent.[4] Thus, we will not permit a conforming \namendment under rule 15(b), see C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § \n1489, at 449 (1971), particularly since plaintiffs never pursued that theory nor sought an \namendment from the district court during some eleven years of litigation. If the school \ndistrict's alleged practice continues today, these proceedings are not res judicata to a \nsubsequent suit for an injunction. In this regard, we express no opinion on the \nconstitutionality of the school district's faculty-staff assignment policy. \nIV. STATE-IMPOSED DUTY TO INTEGRATE \n\nDayton and Columbus make clear that units of government which had a dual system of \nschools before Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 \n(1955) (Brown II), are under an affirmative duty to \"eradicate the effects of that \nsystem.\" Dayton, 443 U.S. at 537, 99 S.Ct. at 2979, 61 L.Ed. at 733; Columbus, 443 U.S. at \n458-59, 99 S.Ct. at 2946-47, 61 L.Ed.2d at 677. Plaintiffs here urge that any time a school \ndistrict has an affirmative duty to integrate, under Dayton and Columbus a presumption of \nsegregative intent arises from evidence of actions with foreseeably segregative \nconsequences. Emphasizing that school districts in California are under a state-imposed \nduty to alleviate desegregation, plaintiffs argue that such a presumption should arise here. \nPlaintiffs' reasoning is faulty on two grounds. First, the \"presumption\" plaintiffs refer to \nin Dayton was actually a burden imposed on the school district of \"showing that actions that \nincreased or continued the effects of the dual system serve important and legitimate \nends.\" Dayton, 443 U.S. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 2979, 61 L.Ed.2d at 734. It was clearly not a \npresumption shifting the burden of proving segregative intent, for proof of segregative intent \nin that case was unnecessary. Second, any duty imposed by state constitutional law has no \neffect on this proceeding other than as a circumstantial evidence of segregative intent. We \nhave been curious from the outset why, if such an affirmative duty existed under state law, \nplaintiffs did not proceed in the more attractive state forum.[5] In any event, the forum \nplaintiffs did choose properly limited its consideration of the state law duty to proof of the \nsegregative intent necessary for a federal constitutional violation. 518 F.Supp. at 642. The \ndistrict judge's finding that school officials were justifiably confused about the scope of their \nduty is soundly based in the record 1134*1134 and his finding that failure to comply with the \nstate duty did not suggest segregative intent is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the \ndistrict court's judgment is \nAFFIRMED.[6] \nFARRIS, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nMinority students are not the only ones who suffer the harmful effects of segregation. All the \nother students in the segregated system, as well as teachers and administrators, are victims \nwhen minority students are removed from the mainstream of public education. The loss is \nnot limited to those within the school system but is borne by all of us who have a stake in \nthe future of this nation. If the limits of the law compel us to perpetuate the exclusion of \nminorities from the mainstream of our national life, we must do so only after the most careful \ndeliberation. \nIf the law of desegregation continues to develop in what the majority conceives as its \npresent direction, it will be all but impossible for a minority litigant to make the showing of \n\"segregative intent\" necessary to establish that an undeniably segregated school system \nhas been unlawfully segregated. There is no dispute that the San Jose public school system \nis racially imbalanced. The record leaves no doubt that the Board was fully aware that their \nchosen course of action over a period of two decades would perpetuate this segregation. \nThe Board does not deny this. \nIn tort law a person is deemed to \"intend\" the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his \nactions. In cases of racial discrimination, however, the foreseeable segregative effect of \n\ninstitutional action will not, in and of itself, support a finding of \"segregative \nintent.\" See Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 536 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 2971, \n2978 n. 9, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979). This more rigorous intent standard, however, does not \nrequire that patterns of behavior which serve no other end than to maintain and perpetuate \na segregated public school system be characterized as unintentional. \nThe record reflects that for twenty years and more the Board of Trustees of the San Jose \nUnified School District has known that the public schools of San Jose were improperly \nsegregated. It has done nothing to correct the situation, even though it has had numerous \nopportunities for reform. Although I have the utmost respect for the trial judge, I disagree \nwith his conclusion that the record demonstrates that the Board maintained a sincere \ncommitment to desegregation in spite of its failure to act. The Board's actions speak louder \nthan its words. It is not disputed that the Board has taken no action to accomplish its stated \ngoal of a desegregated system. The district court found that \"the district has clearly gotten \ncold feet on a number of occasions and has failed to follow through on its claimed goal of \ndesegregating the district.\" Diaz II, 518 F.Supp. at 638. There is nothing in the record or in \nthe district court's analysis to support its conclusion that \"the desire [to desegregate] often \nexpressed is real, even if there has been some reluctance in the execution.\" Id. \nThe district court found and the record shows that there were abundant opportunities for \nactions which would promote desegregation. Whenever the Board was presented with a \nchoice, whenever it had an opportunity to change direction, it made the choice that \nconfirmed and perpetuated segregation in the San Jose public schools. Such consistency in \nthe face of the undeniable fact of segregation is, in my opinion, a clear expression of the \n\"segregative intent\" necessary to support a finding of unlawful segregation. \nThe effect of the majority opinion is to hold that a reluctant school board that talks about \ndesegregation but refuses to do anything to promote it has done all that the constitution \nrequires. I fear that the effect of the majority's position will be that a school board that \nwishes to maintain a segregated system in the future will need only 1135*1135 discuss its \ngoals of desegregation, commit itself on paper, and then reject or refuse to take advantage \nof every opportunity for reform. We cannot permit \"segregative intent\" to be so easily \ncamouflaged. \nI do not ignore the district court's admonition that \"[t]his court would be extremely disturbed \nand saddened if its decision in this case was interpreted by either of the parties to this \naction or the public as encouragement to the Board to lay back and accept the \nconsequences of the imbalance.\" Id. at 644. I simply find it insufficient to address the fact \nthat the public schools of San Jose are segregated and the Board has wilfully rejected every \nproposal to improve the racial imbalance. The district court expresses its concern about the \nfuture. This action was brought to correct the evils of the present. Having prevailed on this \nsordid record, the Board need never act to reform this school system. \nI recognize the narrow limits imposed on our review by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and Pullman-\nStandard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). Even so, I find that \nthe district court, in an admirably thorough and articulate opinion, erred in finding that \ncertain actions of the Board did not demonstrate the \"segregative intent\" necessary to \nsupport a finding of unlawful segregation. Nothing in the record supports the district court's \n\nspeculation that \"[i]t may well be that the Board hoped that some other solution to the \nproblem of integration could be found, short of large-scale bussing.\" Diaz II at 637. \nMy concern is reinforced by the district court's finding that the Board consistently refused to \nimplement other suggestions for reducing the racial imbalance in the San Jose schools. \nThese suggestions included the creation of magnet schools and education parks, as well as \nthe implementation of open enrollment and voluntary bussing. The district court found \n\"perfectly reasonable and rational explanations\" for the Board's refusal to implement any of \nthese proposals. Id. at 638. The only support in the record for such a conclusion is the \nfinding that the Board believed that nothing short of busing could remedy the racial \nimbalance in the San Jose schools, but the record also shows that the Board refused even \nto consider busing as a remedy. In fact the Board refused to consider \nimplementing any proposal which might have reduced the racial imbalance of the San Jose \npublic schools. \nFurther, the district court's conclusion that the Board's behavior during the bond issue \nelection campaign did not support an inference of \"segregative intent\" is not consistent with \nthe undisputed facts. The Board issued public statements that the failure to pass the bond \nissue would result in the transfer of students from one attendance area to another. It also \ngave repeated assurances that it would not use bond issue money to finance busing for the \npurpose of desegregation, although busing for other purposes was widely used throughout \nthe system. I conclude that the message of those two statements upon the voters in San \nJose was \"if you don't vote for the bond issue, we will have to desegregate\" and \"if you do \nvote for the bond issue, we promise not to use the money to desegregate.\" This, together \nwith the court's findings, is more than sufficient to support an inference of \"segregative \nintent.\" \nThe Board rejected all of QUEST's recommendations for correcting the racial imbalance. In \nspite of this, the district court concluded that \"the Board was trying its best, in a difficult \nsituation, to continue to move forward towards some affirmative effort to integrate.\" Id. at \n640. There is no evidence in the record that the Board ever \"move[d] forward\" or was \n\"continu[ing] to move forward.\" The district court set forth its rationale for refusing to find \ninferences of \"segregative intent\": \nTo make such an inference would be to warn all school districts which have racially \nimbalanced schools not to make any affirmative moves towards integration unless they are \ncertain that they will succeed; otherwise, the effort will become the basis for an inference of \ndiscriminatory purpose on their part, rather than an inference of the very opposite intent \nwhich in fact motivated them. 1136*1136 Id. at 641. I agree that a finding of \"segregative \nintent\" would broadcast a message to other segregated school systems, but I disagree with \nthe district court on the substance of that message. A finding of \"segregative intent\" here \nwould signal school boards that it is not enough merely to talk about desegregation while \navoiding all proposals that might remedy the evil. I must respectfully reject the district \ncourt's conclusion that even if \"the Board ultimately did little to implement its stated \ncommitment to integration,\" it nevertheless merits congratulations for \"its willingness to stick \nby this position [in favor of integration], even if just rhetorically.\" Id. at 641. \n\nI recognize that the federal constitution does not require the Board to integrate the public \nschools of San Jose. The Board's only obligation is that it not segregate intentionally. The \nrecord and the district court's findings compel my conclusion that the Board failed to meet \nthis obligation. I would reverse with instructions to fashion a remedy to correct the \nunconstitutional segregation in the San Jose public school system. It is of no comfort to the \nplaintiffs that the district court concluded that \"[c]ontinued failure to choose the path which \nleads towards less ethnic imbalance in the schools could well, at some future time, form the \nbasis for a conclusion that the school officials do, in fact, wish to keep the Anglos and the \nSpanish-surnamed students segregated in the SJUSD.\" Id. at 644. More than twenty years \nhave elapsed with no break in this continuing failure. This, in my opinion, is sufficient to \nsupport an inference of \"segregative intent.\" \nI would reverse. \n[*] The Honorable Shiro Kashiwa, Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by \ndesignation. \n[1] The initiative permits the school board to assign a student beyond his neighborhood school if he \"requires special \neducation, care or guidance\" or if \"there are health or safety hazards, either natural or man made, or physical barriers \nor obstacles ... between the student's place of residence and the nearest or next nearest school\" or if \"the school \nnearest or next nearest to his place or residence is unfit or inadequate because of overcrowding, unsafe conditions or \nlack of physical facilities.\" Wash.Rev.Code § 28A.26.010 (1981). \n[2] \"Except for racially-balancing purposes, Initiative 350 permits local school districts to assign students other than to \ntheir nearest or next nearest schools for most, if not all, of the major reasons for which students are at present \nassigned to schools other than the nearest or next nearest schools.\" Seattle School District No. 1 v. Washington, 473 \nF.Supp. 996, 1010 (W.D.Wash.1979). \n[3] If legislation did exist that removes certain powers from school districts, it would not, of itself, be objectionable. \n\"[T]he political majority may generally restructure the political process to place obstacles in the path of everyone;\" the \nconstitutional infirmity obtains only \"when the state allocates governmental power non-neutrally, by explicitly using the \nracial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process.\" Washington v. Seattle School District No. \n1, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 102 S.Ct. 3187, 3195, 73 L.Ed.2d 896, 907 (1982). \n[4] \"However, this court is concerned, in the context of this suit, only with any effect that this assignment policy had on \nthe segregation of the student population of the schools.\" 518 F.Supp. at 641. \n[5] Until 1979, the California Constitution empowered state courts to order desegregation measures regardless of \nwhether the segregation was de jure or de facto in origin. See Crawford v. Board of Education, 17 Cal.3d 280, 130 \nCal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28 (1976). In 1979, California voters ratified Proposition I, an amendment to the due process \nand equal protection clauses of the state constitution. Proposition I conforms the power of state courts to order pupil \nschool assignment and transportation to that exercised by federal courts under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. Proposition I was upheld in Crawford v. Board of Education, ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. \n3211, 73 L.Ed.2d 948 (1982). \n[6] In so doing, we endorse the perceptive admonition of Chief Judge Peckham in the Conclusion of his exhaustive \nand thoughtful opinion of July 15, 1981. 518 F.Supp. at 644. \n ",

DIAZ et al., Plaintiffs, \nv. \nSAN JOSE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT et al., Defendants. \nNo. C-71-2130 RFP. \nUnited States District Court, N. D. California. \nJanuary 1, 1976. \n311*311 Stephen V. R. Manley, Community Legal Services, Richard J. Wylie, Wylie, Leahy, \nBlunt & McBride, San Jose, Cal., for plaintiffs. \nWilliam M. Siegel, County Counsel, Leland D. Stephenson, Deputy County Counsel, San \nJose, Cal., for defendants. \nOPINION \nPECKHAM, District Judge. \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs, parents of Spanish-surnamed American children attending public school in the \nSan Jose Unified School District, bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated. They charge that defendants, the San Jose Unified School District, its \nSuperintendent, and members of its Board of Education, have purposefully operated and \nmaintained a segregated public school system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nDefendants admit the existing racial imbalance in the school system, but argue that ethnic \nimbalance results not from defendants' intentional conduct but from demographic and \nresidential patterns over which they have no control. Jurisdiction is vested in this court by 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1343(3), 1343(4) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nOn November 4, 1971, plaintiffs instituted this action and sought a temporary restraining \norder and a preliminary injunction to restrain defendants from completing construction of the \nfollowing schools until the court could determine the merits of this case: \nCollege Park Elementary Anne Darling Elementary Gardner Elementary Hester Elementary \nJefferson Elementary Lincoln Glen Elementary[1] Longfellow-Edison (combined \nelementary/continuation)[2] Lowell Elementary Mann Elementary Olinder Elementary \nWashington Elementary Roosevelt Junior High Wilson Junior High \n \n\n \n \n \nOn November 4, this court denied plaintiffs' ex parte application for a temporary restraining \norder and issued an order to show cause. After a hearing on November 10, 1971, the court \nissued a temporary restraining order prohibiting construction of almost all[3] of the schools \nslated for reconstruction pending a hearing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. \nAfter extensive oral argument on December 17, 1971, this court denied plaintiffs' motion for \na preliminary injunction. In the opinion dated January 12, 1972, the court concluded that on \nthe record presently available: \n. . . [t]his Court does not believe that such [ethnic] imbalance alone constitutes a violation of \nplaintiffs' civil rights. As the Sixth Circuit recently pointed out in Davis v. School District of \nCity of Pontiac, Inc., 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 40 U.S.L.W. 3192 [404 U.S. 913, \n92 S.Ct. 233, 30 L.Ed.2d 186] (1971), `a school district has no affirmative obligation to \nachieve a balance of the races in the 312*312 schools when the existing imbalance is not \nattributable to school policies or practices and is the result of housing patterns and other \nforces over which the school administration had no control.' 443 F.2d at 575. \nPlaintiffs cannot hope to succeed on the merits, then, unless they can demonstrate how the \ndefendant School District has acted to create ethnic imbalance in the San Jose schools. \nAfter examining the evidence plaintiffs have offered in support of a preliminary injunction \nthis Court can find no instances where defendant School District has acted impermissibly. \nThe evidence shows that defendant School District has adhered to a `neighborhood school \npolicy,' with the result that ethnic composition of the schools merely reflects residential \npatterns. This is not a case like Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Education, 311 F.Supp. \n501 (D.Colo.1970); Keyes v. School District Number 1, Denver, Colo., 313 F.Supp. 61 \n(D.Colo.1970), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 445 F.2d 990 (10th Cir. 1971); or Davis v. School \nDistrict of City of Pontiac, Inc., supra, where the defendant school districts claimed to be \nfollowing a neighborhood school policy, but conveniently refrained from strict adherence to \nthat policy when it appeared to be leading to increased integration. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that given the evidence available at this stage in the litigation, \nthere is an insufficient likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits to warrant the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction; and plaintiffs' motion is hereby DENIED. \nTrial on the merits was held on July 16, 18-19, 23-25 and August 6, 8-9, 16 and 20, 1974. A \ntranscript was prepared and the parties were ordered to submit proposed findings of fact \nand conclusions of law. The court heard oral argument on April 30, May 1 and May 13, \n1975. \nII. THE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs in this action are Arnulfo M. Diaz and Socorro Diaz, as parents and next friends of \nFernando Diaz, Miguel A. Diaz and Juan F. Diaz; Jose Vasquez, as parent and next friend \nof David Vasquez, Susan Vasquez and Jody-Lynn Vasquez. \nWhen this action was filed in November, 1971, each of the six named minor plaintiffs \nattended either junior high school or high school within defendant San Jose Unified School \n \n\n \n \n \nDistrict. By 1973, when the trial commenced, two of the student plaintiffs attended either \njunior high school, high school, or continuation schools, and both were expected to enroll \nand continue in San Jose high schools for the school year 1974-1975. \nDefendants are the San Jose Unified School District (\"school district\"), a political subdivision \nand school district of the State of California; Charles Knight, individually and as District \nSuperintendent of the San Jose Unified School District; Neil H. Geier, Jr.; Elizabeth J. Allen; \nEdwin P. Jones, Jr.; Mary K. McCreath; and Donald L. Raimondi, individually and as \nmembers of the Board of Education of the San Jose Unified School District (\"board\") as of \nNovember, 1971, when this action commenced. During the pendency of this action, Phillip \nL. Hammer replaced Edwin P. Jones, Jr. as a board member, effective July 1, 1973, and \nhaving appeared as a party herein through counsel of record is hereby substituted as a \nparty in place of Mr. Jones. \nThis is a class action brought pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nclass consisting of all Spanish-surnamed students enrolled in the San Jose Unified School \nDistrict and their parents. Spanish-surnamed Americans are the only substantial minority \ngroup in the district. \nIII. GENERAL BACKGROUND \nSan Jose Unified School District is a political subdivision of the State of California operated \nby and pursuant to state law. General direction and control of the district is vested in the \nBoard of 313*313 Education comprised of five members who are elected to four-year terms. \nThe Chief Executive Officer of the school district is the Superintendent of Schools. \nFrom 1963 through 1974, the following persons held positions as Superintendent and board \nmembers of the district: \n         Superintendent                    Board Members \n \n         1963  Crandall    Jones      Gunderson    Gale      \nButcher      Douglass \n \n         1964  Crandall    Jones      Gunderson    Gale      \nButcher      Geier \n                                                                          \n(8/6/64) \n \n         1965  Crandall    Jones      Gunderson    Gale      \nButcher      Geier \n \n         1966  Downing     Jones      Gunderson    McCreath  \nButcher      Geier \n               (7/1/66) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n         1967  Downing     Jones      Gunderson    McCreath  \nButcher      Geier \n \n         1968  Downing     Jones      Gunderson    McCreath  \nButcher      Geier \n \n         1969  Downing     Jones      Hopkins      McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \n                                      (5/1/69)               \n(7/1/69) \n \n         1970  Knight      Jones      Hopkins      McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \n               (7/1/70) \n \n         1971  Knight      Jones      Allen        McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \n                                      (7/1/71) \n \n         1972  Knight      Jones      Allen        McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \n \n         1973  Knight      Hammer     Allen        McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \n                           (7/1/73) \n \n         1974  Knight      Hammer     Allen        McCreath  \nRaimondi     Geier \nThe district is situated in Santa Clara County, with the northerly terminus being located \napproximately at the intersections of Highway 17 and Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway) in \nthe City of San Jose, California. It extends south in a banana-like shape through central San \nJose, approximately 16[4] air miles to a point beyond the Almaden Valley area. The width of \nthe district varies along its length from four air miles maximum to one and one-half air miles \nminimum across in an east-west direction, the narrowest portion being located \napproximately at the southern boundaries of Broadway and Washington Elementary \nSchools. The driving distance of the district totals almost 20 miles. The extreme north and \nsouth schools, Bachrodt and Hacienda, while only 12.2 air miles apart, are separated by 17 \nmiles' driving distance along the major north-south transportation route which winds through \ncentral San Jose. \nThe northern one-half of the district is composed of residential neighborhoods, the San Jose \nMunicipal Airport, a Civic Center and central San Jose. The makeup of the area has been \naltered by urban renewal, freeway construction and acquisition, extension of industrial, \ncommercial and office facilities, and expansion of the airport. The southern half of the \n \n\n \n \n \ndistrict is primarily a suburban area which developed from the late 1950's throughout the \n1960's. \nSince World War II, ethnic minorities have been increasingly concentrated in San Jose's \nnorthern downtown area. While the total population in the downtown area increased only \nslightly between 1950 and 1960, the minority population more than tripled. \n314*314 In 1950, the school district consisted of a total of 24 schools: 16 elementary \nschools, 5 junior high schools, and 3 high schools. The northern boundaries of the district \nwere extended by the 1956 annexation of the Sunol School District. The southern \nboundaries were extended by the 1956 annexation of the Almaden Elementary School \nDistrict. Since 1956, when Sunol and Almaden were annexed, the external boundaries of \nthe district have not changed. \nBetween 1950 and 1970, the student enrollment in the district increased by over 250%, and \nthe total number of schools doubled to house the increased student population. By the fall \nof 1973, the district's Board of Trustees operated 43 schools, enrolling 36,687 students. \nThere are presently 31 elementary schools, three 3-year junior high schools, two 2-year \njunior high schools, three 3-year high schools, two 4-year high schools, and two special \nschools. \nThe racial composition of the district student population is as follows: \n                  TABLE 1 \n \n  Race               Percentage      Total \n \n  Anglo                 70.8         25,974 \n  Spanish-surnamed      24.6          9,037 \n  Black                  1.5            561 \n  Other Minorities       3.0          1,118 \nA \"segregated\" or \"ethnically imbalanced\" school is defined as a school in which the racial \nor ethnic makeup of the school's student enrollment is substantially out of proportion with \nthe racial and ethnic makeup of the student population as a whole. Under guidelines \npromulgated by the State of California, a school is imbalanced \"if the percentage of pupils of \none or more ethnic groups differs by more than 15 percentage points from that in all schools \nin the district.\" Calif.Admin.Code § 2011. \nSince 1964, the schools of the San Jose Unified School District have been substantially \nimbalanced. The State Department of Education Bureau of Intergroup Relations advised the \ndistrict in the fall of 1968 that 41 of its 50 schools were ethnically imbalanced. The trend \ntoward concentration has continued: while the total student enrollment in the northern \ndowntown schools has declined, the percentage of Spanish-surnamed students has \nincreased. \n \n\n \n \n \nThe Spanish-surnamed population in the district has declined from 29.7% in 1966 to 24.6% \nin 1973. From this group, 78.8% of the Spanish-surnamed schoolage children reside in the \nnorthern downtown area. Reflecting this demographic concentration, the student population \nof the northern downtown schools is presently 60.5% Spanish-surnamed, while the student \npopulation of the southern schools is only .07% Spanish-surnamed. \nThe district has followed a pattern of selecting sites for school construction according to \ntheir projected long-range requirements. For additional capacity to meet peak year \nenrollments, portable classrooms are attached to permanent structures or tacked together \nto form independent units. \nStudent assignment is dictated by a mandatory attendance boundary; the board requires \nstudents to attend schools within the designated geographical areas of their residence. This \nrequirement, commonly termed a \"neighborhood school policy,\" fixes boundaries for \nschools so that they are relatively convenient to the students; the goal of the system is \n\"walking distance\" for as many children as enrollment and facility availability permit. \nBecause \"walking distance\" varies substantially between elementary and secondary pupils, \nthe board uses transportation within attendance areas where mandated by considerations \nof distance and safety.[5] The only students transported outside attendance areas are those \nwith special needs — e.g., those with physical or mental disability 315*315 — who attend \nspecial schools which serve the entire district. \nIV. FACTS \nTo prove that defendants have operated a segregated school system in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment, plaintiffs first established that the board was fully aware of the \nexisting racial imbalance in the district, and then attempted to demonstrate that ethnic \nimbalance resulted from defendants' intentional conduct. To prove segregative intent, \nplaintiffs introduced evidence of the district's educational policies on (1) site selection and \nschool construction; (2) adoption of a neighborhood school policy with board-designated \nattendance areas; (3) reconstruction of Field Act schools; (4) school closures and student \nreassignments; (5) location of portable classrooms and maintenance of double sessions; (6) \nstudent transportation; (7) presentation of materials supporting bond elections; (8) response \nto integration proposals by a citizens' committee; (9) faculty and staff assignments and (10) \nfailure to integrate despite a state statutory duty and a publicly-issued board policy to relieve \nethnic imbalance. \nA. District's Knowledge of Racial Imbalance \nThe district's board of education has long been aware of the growing concentration of \nminority residents in the northern downtown area. The board acknowledged the existence of \nsegregated housing patterns in a 1963 resolution. Moreover, the San Jose Planning \nDepartment prepared a public report entitled \"Housing Report for the Planning \nCommission,\" detailing the ethnic residential makeup of the district and projecting racial \n \n\n \n \n \ndemographic patterns through 1990. In 1970, the San Jose City Planning Department \nprepared a \"Demographic Report\" for a subcommittee of the district's Quality Urban \nEducation Study Team (QUEST), a citizens' committee charged with evaluating integration \nproposals in the San Jose school system. The board had access to these reports and knew \ntheir recommendations and supporting data. \nThe board has been and is aware that it operates a system of predominantly Spanish-\nsurnamed schools in the northern downtown core and predominantly Anglo schools in the \nsouthern suburban area. \nAs early as 1962, the board acknowledged that segregation was inherently harmful and \nrecognized the need for a comprehensive study of racial and ethnic isolation within the \nschools. In a resolution dated January 17, 1963, the board recognized the correlation \nbetween de facto segregation and social evils affecting community life. Stating that \nsegregation is aggravated by designation of school boundaries, the board promised to \ninitiate a comprehensive study of ethnic segregation in the school system. \nIn 1964, the district conducted its first ethnic survey of the schools which confirmed the \npattern of imbalance in the schools. In 1965, in what was then policy # 5007.1, the board \npledged that, in establishing attendance areas, it would attempt to avoid ethnic segregation \nof students. \nStarting in 1966, in compliance with state requirements, the district conducted annual racial \nand ethnic surveys of its schools, which disclosed in each and every year a continued \npattern of racial imbalance. \nIn 1968, the Santa Clara County Office of Education issued a report entitled \"Improving \nEthnic Balance and Intergroup Relations\" prepared by consultant Edwin T. Rios, which \ndiscussed the deleterious effect of ethnic imbalance in the public school system. \nThe State Department of Education advised the board that in 1968 41 of its 50 schools were \nracially imbalanced by state standards. By 1973, substantial imbalance remained in the \npublic schools. \nOn February 10, 1969, the board unanimously voted to reaffirm its commitment to a quality \nintegrated educational program. The board also voted to establish a broad-based citizens' \ncommittee 316*316 charged with launching a comprehensive study of ethnic imbalance in \nthe school district and evaluating proposals for integrated education. The board authorized \nthe newly-formed committee to work with consulting services from the State Department of \nEducation and other agencies. By this resolution, the board officially created the QUEST \ncommittee. \nOn March 11, 1970, the board issued a policy statement directed to the QUEST committee, \nreaffirming its commitment to integration: \n \n\n \n \n \nTo us a commitment to quality integration means equal opportunity for each student in the \ndistrict to obtain a quality education. To many, the emphasis has been only on \"quality \neducation.\" \nIn this regard, we are mindful of a recent statement of President Nixon. \"`Quality education' \nis already being interpreted as a code word for a delay of desegregation. We must never let \nthis meaning take hold.\" \nQuality is what education is all about; desegregation is vital to that quality; as we improve \nthe quality of education for all American children, we will help them improve the quality of \ntheir own lives in the next generation. \nWe, too, believe that integration of the schools is a necessary and important component of \nquality education. Therefore, it is our desire that Quest review all attendance practices \nincluding busing, maintenance of neighborhood schools, transfer policies, attendance \nboundaries, etc., in light of how they add or detract in the accomplishment of our primary \nobjective of a quality integrated education. \nHowever, integration as the \"primary objective\" is modified later in this same policy \nstatement. \nOn the problem as a whole, however, it is our preliminary judgment that as between the \nbroad areas of instructional program on the one hand and achieving racial and ethnic \nbalance on the other for the near term priority should be given to the instructional program. \nWe are motivated in this by the belief that the hoped-for benefits of racial and ethnic \nbalance in the schools will not be achieved unless revisions have been made in the \ninstructional program, the grouping of students and the training of teachers to make the \nentire school experience more responsive to the needs of all elements of our community. \nSimply stated, a racially balanced school is not necessarily an integrated one and does not \nnecessarily provide a quality education. For the long term, we feel that priority should be \nplaced on achieving racial and ethnic balance in our schools to the fullest extent possible \nwithin our means as it is to us an essential component of quality integrated education. \nFinally, we wish to restate our overall philosophy that we are committed to serving the \nneeds of this community. And as in the past, this Board would not voluntarily adopt a \nprogram which it had reason to believe the community had not participated in or would not \nsupport. \nAs indicated by the events listed above, the board clearly knew of the established pattern of \nracial imbalance within the school system for years prior to the filing of this action. \nDefendants readily concede both the existence of ethnic imbalance and their awareness of \nthe problem. The central issue in this litigation is whether the board intentionally created or \nmaintained ethnic imbalance. \nB. District Actions and Policies \n1. Site selection and school construction. Since 1965, the district has constructed nine new \nschools on newly-selected sites. As shown by Table 2, all nine opened as imbalanced \nschools. In selecting sites for school construction in the Spanish-surnamed northern \n \n\n \n \n \ndowntown core, the school district allegedly followed the guidelines outlined in the state's \n\"Checklist for Evaluation of Attendance Practices and/or Proposed School Sites\"; however, \nthe district 317*317 failed to consider the state guidelines for school construction in the Anglo \nsuburban area. When it selected sites, the board knew that the newly-constructed schools \nwould be imbalanced from inception. \nBy 1973, the district had planned or commenced construction of additional schools in the \npredominantly Anglo southern suburban area. Ethnic residential patterns indicate that these \nfacilities will open as imbalanced schools. \n                            TABLE 2 \n \n                                Percentage         Percentage \n                  Year       Spanish-surnamed   Spanish-surnamed \nSchool           Opened        When Opened           in 1973 \n \nWilliams \n  (elementary)    1968             2.2                 1.4 \n \nHenderson \n  (elementary)    1966             5.4                 1.5 \n \nSimonds \n  (elementary)    1966             1.7                 2.7 \n \nBret Harte \n  (Jr. high)      1966             7.0                 3.4 \n \nLeland (high)     1967             5.1                 3.4 \n \nAllen \n  (elementary)    1965            14.6                 4.7 \n \nErickson \n  (elementary)    1968             9.4                 6.4 \n \nHammer \n  (elementary)    1966            13.7                 6.6 \n \nTerrell \n  (elementary)    1966            20.8                 7.7 \n2. Replacement of Field Act schools. The Field Act was adopted by the California \nLegislature in 1933 (former California Education Code § 18191), and is presently found in \nCalifornia Education Code §§ 15451 et seq. and § 15501 et seq. This \"emergency\" \nlegislation resulted from public concern following the destruction of many schools by the \n \n\n \n \n \nLong Beach earthquake on March 10, 1933. The rules and regulations prescribed under the \nauthority of the Field Act established minimum requirements for the design, construction \nand reconstruction of public school buildings \"in order to attain the requisite stability to \nwithstand vertical loads and lateral forces (wind or earthquake) . . .\" 20 Cal.Admin. Code, § \n2. \nUnder the 1967 Amendments to California Education Code, §§ 15501 et seq., all school \ndistricts were required to order an inspection of school facilities on or before January 1, \n1970, to evaluate the safety of buildings. The amended statute required a district governing \nboard to commence plans for the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of any building \nfound unsafe no later than six months from receipt of the examination report. \nAfter the statutory inspection, structural engineers found that numerous school buildings in \nthe San Jose school district failed to meet the requirements of the Field Act.[6] \nFollowing the Los Angeles earthquake in February, 1971, which, among other casualties, \ndestroyed several school buildings, the board voted to close all unsafe Field Act schools at \nthe end of the 1971 school year. The district ordered the buildings razed, and, pending \nreconstruction, housed the students in portable structures with double sessions. \nOn January 21, 1971, the board created a Building Master Plan Task Group (\"Task Group\") \nand subsidiary local committees with responsibility for individual high school attendance \nareas (\"Task Forces\"). The Task Group's goal was to establish a construction program and \nlaunch a \"fast-track\" building program to house the Field Act students in new facilities by fall \nof 1972. In formulating recommendations for the district's reconstruction policy, the Task \nGroup studied the proposed reconstruction of Field Act schools on existing sites. The Task \nGroup commenced work on April 14, 1971, and continued with assistance from the \nWestinghouse Learning Corporation. \nShortly after receipt of the Task Group's report, in May of 1972, the board decided to rebuild \nmost of the downtown Field Act schools on their original sites. 318*318 The decision \nreflected the demand of local parents; the board did not consider the impact of \nreconstruction on existing ethnic imbalance. No legal obligation compelled the board to \nrebuild the Field Act schools on their original sites. On August 5, 1971, the board resolved \nto authorize construction of the following facilities in replacement of Field Act schools: \n(a) Schools were to be built in the Washington-Gardner area; \n(b) Olinder School was to be rebuilt on the existing Roosevelt site; \n(c) Anne Darling, Trace, Hester, Willow Glen, and Lowell schools were to be built on their \nexisting sites. \nThe board later authorized the following changes or additions to the basic plan: \n \n\n \n \n \n(1) Olinder was rebuilt on a \"new site\"; \n(2) Mann remained rebuilt as a portable on site; and \n(3) Lincoln Glen (new classroom space) was rebuilt. \nLocal committees of the Task Group were subjected to opposition to reconstruction of the \nWashington and Gardner Elementary schools and Wilson Junior High School; however, \nmembers of the Spanish-surnamed community pressured for rebuilding of these facilities. \nSubsequently, over objection of board member McCreath—who voiced a concern that \nrebuilding of Wilson Junior High might constitute an act of de jure segregation — the board \napproved reconstruction of Gardner and Washington elementary schools and of Wilson \nJunior High School, with a restructured grade level. (Wilson was ultimately not rebuilt. See \ndiscussion, infra.) \nThe board's election to rebuild most Field Act schools on their original sites resulted in the \nfollowing pattern of ethnic imbalance in the student population: \n                             TABLE 3 \n \n                     Rebuilt Field Act Schools \n \n                                    1971                1973 \n                                 Percentage          Percentage \nSchool                        Spanish-surnamed    Spanish-surnamed \n \nWashington                          78.4                86.6 \n \nGardner                             87.8                86.5 \n \nGrant                               71.7                78.9 \n \nOlinder (traded with city \n  for land)                         73.8                76.2 \n \nAnne Darling                        73.4                67.4 \n \nBurnett                             65.2                66.6 \n \nHester                              43.6                59.2 \n \nLowell                              49.5                58.4 \n \nHorace Mann                         50.2                56.0 \n \nTrace                               18.3                24.0 \n \n\n \n \n \n \nWillow Glen                         16.8                16.3 \n \nAlmaden (site moved from \n  commercial area)                   6.3                 6.5 \nTrace and Willow Glen were the only two schools that were balanced in 1971 and the only \ntwo that were balanced in 1973. Ten of the reconstructed schools were imbalanced in 1971 \nand remained imbalanced in 1973. \nOnly two of the Field Act schools, Olinder and Almaden, were rebuilt on different sites. The \nrelocation failed to relieve imbalance; both schools were imbalanced in 1971 and remained \nso in 1973. In neither school were attendance areas or boundaries altered. \nIn 1971, the student population at Washington Elementary School was 78.4% Spanish-\nsurnamed and the student population at Gardner was 87.8% Spanish-surnamed. The two \nschools, with the district's greatest Spanish-surnamed concentration in 1971, remained the \ndistrict's most imbalanced schools in 1973. When the board directed the schools closed \nunder the Field Act, the board established portable classrooms at the original sites and \nmaintained the existing boundaries. Recognizing that Washington and Gardner would \nremain imbalanced schools, the board voted over member McCreath's opposition to rebuild \nthe facilities on their original sites: \nQ. What was your opposition, Mrs. McCreath? \n319*319 A. The Washington-Gardner-Wilson area is a pocket area, it's pretty well self-\ncontained, it's cut off by a freeway and it has traditionally been an area that is very much in \nimbalance, about as imbalanced as any in our district. \nQ. By that you mean segregated? \nA. Yes, segregated. And I felt that that is one area in our school system that is close to \nWillow Glen, the transportation would not be difficult, and I felt that we should begin \nintegrating in that area. \nQ. In other words, the students could attend Willow Glen easily? \nA. Yes. However, community pressure was brought to bear to maintain schools, replace the \nschools. \nQ. On their original sites? \nA. On their original sites. \nBy 1973, Washington — constructed entirely from portable classrooms — serviced 797 \nstudents, of whom 86.6% were Spanish-surnamed. Because of the crowding, Washington \nstudents attended double sessions. \nIn electing to rebuild Washington and Gardner, the board rejected a Westinghouse Study \nproposal recommending that Washington and Gardner students be dispersed to contiguous \nschools. Dr. Knight testified that adoption of the Westinghouse Study proposal would have \nincreased ethnic balance among the area's schools. There existed several alternative \n \n\n \n \n \nmethods for student reassignment which would have reduced imbalance. One mile from \nWashington, the Riverglen School housed 382 students on a 7.6 acre site. With an \nenrollment of 19.2% Spanish-surnamed students, Riverglen was 67.4% less concentrated \nthan Washington. Despite the fact that Riverglen was operating under capacity, no \nWashington students were transferred. Students from the Little Orchard neighborhood, \nwhich is almost 100% Spanish-surnamed, were assigned for years to Washington, even \nthough they actually lived closer to Riverglen. Although the board considered plans to \nchange boundaries for several years, it maintained the existing lines in the face of \nopposition from Riverglen parents. \nCanoas, situated approximately three or four miles from Gardner, was housing 218 students \n— only 9.7% of whom were Spanish-surnamed — on a 7.25 acre site. With no portables, \nCanoas was operating under capacity. At no time did the board consider transferring \nGardner students to Canoas to alleviate imbalance. Lincoln Glen, located on a 6.4 acre site \none mile from Washington and two miles from Gardner, housed 326 students, of whom 15% \nwere Spanish-surnamed. Although Lincoln Glen was operating under capacity, the board \nnever considered transferring students to Lincoln Glen to relieve imbalance at Washington \nor Gardner. \n3. School closures. Four of the Field Act schools were not rebuilt: Jefferson, Longfellow, \nWilson and Roosevelt. Three downtown non-Field Act schools were also closed: College \nPark, Belden and Bascom. Reassignment of students from the closed schools generally \nresulted in newly-constituted student enrollments with better ethnic balance than the \nexisting racial concentration at the original schools. In each case, the Spanish-surnamed \npopulation increased at the receiving school. \nEffective September, 1972, the district consolidated the Longfellow and Hester attendance \nareas, thereby eliminating Longfellow, which had a 90.4% Spanish-surnamed enrollment in \n1971; the consolidated student body resulted in a 60.7% Spanish-surnamed concentration \nat Hester. A school-by-school comparison of possible combinations of Longfellow with \nadjacent elementary attendance boundaries (using 1971 figures) indicates that combination \nwith Hester resulted in the best ethnic balance at the receiving school: \n320*320 \n                            Spanish-surnamed   Spanish-surnamed \n \n                Enrollment     Enrollment         Percentage \n \nLongfellow:        136            123                90.4 \n \n1.

A comparison of the possible combinations of Bascom \nwith adjacent elementary district boundaries indicates that the combination with Trace \nresulted in the best ethnic balance at the receiving school: \n                            Spanish-surnamed  Spanish-surnamed \n                Enrollment     Enrollment        Percentage \n \nBascom:            174              73              39.9 \n \n1.

The board's inquiry was limited to redesignating boundaries within the \nnorthern downtown area; boundary alteration within this area would not affect racial \nconcentration. \nArt Ryder, a parent and former chairperson of the Magnet School Task Force of QUEST, \nstated in an appearance before the board on March 15, 1973, that closing College Park and \nJefferson afforded an opportunity to implement integration. He urged the board to transfer \nCollege Park and Jefferson students not to Bachrodt but to schools south of Willow Glen. \nThe board, however, failed to consider the Ryder proposals or investigate alternative \nmeasures directed towards improving ethnic balance. The board decided to keep the \nstudents \"in generally the same area,\" rather than relieve imbalance. \nA school-by-school analysis of the closed facilities (1972 figures) indicates that \nconsolidation of each school with Bachrodt resulted in a better ethnic balance than possible \nby combination with any adjacent attendance areas. \n                               Spanish-surnamed   Spanish-surnamed \n                  Enrollment      Enrollment         Percentage \n \n   College Park:     221             136                61.5 \n \n1.

This would have \nrepresented a 5% decrease for College Park students, a 4% decrease for Belden students \nand a 15% decrease for Jefferson students; no superior alternative combination was \npossible within the adjacent attendance areas. The actual (as opposed to projected) \npercentage of Spanish-surnamed students increased to 61.9%; this resulted from a \n \n\n \n \n \ndeparture of approximately 180 students — 150 of whom were Anglo — from the combined \nattendance areas. \nIn 1971, the board closed Roosevelt Junior High School, with 64.8% Spanish-surnamed \nstudents, and Wilson Junior High School, with 79.6% Spanish-surnamed students. Both had \nbeen three-year schools servicing seventh, eighth and ninth grade students. \nAfter the disputed decision of October 21, 1971, to reconstruct Wilson, the district \nunsuccessfully attempted to obtain facilities for Wilson in the September 1972 bond \nelection. On December 21, 1972, the Woodrow Wilson Rebuilding Committee reminded the \nboard of its obligation to rebuild Wilson; however, in the 1973 bond issue, the district failed \nto include funds for a reconstructed Wilson. Following a series of actions initiated by the \nSuperintendent on July 3, 1973, and a series of board discussions on July 12, July 19, \nSeptember 16 and September 20, the board decided not to rebuild Wilson. Instead, the \nboard finalized the existing interim allocation of junior high school students among \nMarkham, Burnett and Hoover junior high schools and Lincoln High School. \nThe two remaining downtown junior high schools, Burnett with 64.9% Spanish-surnamed \nstudents and Hoover with 27.8% Spanish-surnamed students, were contracted from three-\nyear (seventh, eighth, and ninth grades) junior high schools to two-year schools (seventh \nand eighth grade). Correspondingly, two downtown high schools, Lincoln High School, with \n43.1% Spanish-surnamed students, and San Jose High School, with 59.6% Spanish-\nsurnamed students, received the ninth grades formerly housed at Burnett and Hoover and \nbecame four-year high schools servicing ninth through twelfth grades. \nThis restructuring resulted in the following attendance pattern. Seventh and eighth grade \nstudents, formerly attending Wilson Junior High School, now attended Hoover, Burnett or \nMarkham junior high schools; former Wilson ninth grade students now attended Lincoln \nHigh School. Seventh and eighth grade students formerly attending Roosevelt Junior High \nSchool now attended Burnett Junior High School; former Roosevelt ninth grade students \nnow attended San Jose High School. \nThe restructuring resulted in the following ethnic impact on the receiving schools: \n                         TABLE 4 \n \n                           Percentage        Percentage \n                        Spanish-surnamed  Spanish-surnamed \n  School                     (1970)            (1973)     \n \n  Burnett Junior High         64.9              66.9 \n \n  Hoover Junior High          27.8              42.8 \n \n  San Jose High               59.6              64.7 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n  Lincoln High                43.1              50.2 \n \n  Markham Junior High          7.2              18.4 \nThus, restructuring aggravated racial imbalance at each receiving school. The most \npronounced case was Hoover Junior High School which, formerly one of the district's few \nethnically balanced schools, became an imbalanced school. From the vantage point of the \ntransferred students, 322*322 however, restructured attendance either improved ethnic \nbalance or maintained the previous level. Seventh and eighth grade students at Roosevelt \ntransferred from a school with a 64.8% imbalance to a school with a 66.9% imbalance. \nRoosevelt ninth grade students transferred from an imbalance of 64.8% to an imbalance of \n64.7% at San Jose High School. Seventh and eighth grade students at Wilson Junior High \nSchool transferred from a school with a 79.6% imbalance to schools with imbalances of \n42.8% (Hoover Junior High School), 66.9% (Burnett Junior High School), and 18.4% \n(Markham Junior High School). Ninth grade students at Wilson transferred from 79.6% \nimbalance to 50.2% imbalance at Lincoln High School. \nThe board failed to formulate or evaluate alternative proposals for student transfers from \nRoosevelt. The board did not consider transporting Roosevelt students to a less impacted \nfacility than San Jose High School. Nor did the board consider housing Roosevelt Junior \nSchool students in portables at Bret Harte Junior High School or John Muir Junior High \nSchool in the south, which would have resulted in improved balance. In housing high school \nstudents transferred from Roosevelt, the district did add portables to San Jose High School \nin the northern downtown core. \nBefore finalizing the restructuring decision, the district considered transferring all Wilson \nJunior High School students to adjacent Markham Junior High School, with only 7.2% \nSpanish-surnamed students. Because Markham was conducting double sessions, the \nproposed transfer was contemplated as a temporary measure pending location of a site in \nthe southernmost portion of the northern downtown core for a magnet school with a large \n\"integrated student body.\" However, community opposition developed, and a parents' \nmeeting held at Markham Junior High School indicated mass hostility to bussing students \nfrom Wilson to Markham. In the face of this opposition, the board decided to restructure \ngrades and transfer the majority of Wilson students to the northern Hoover, Burnett and \nLincoln junior high schools. \nBy 1973, the junior and senior high schools in the district reflected the following ethnic \nmakeup: \n                             TABLE 5 \n \n                                          Percentage \n      School                           Spanish-surnamed \n \n \n\n \n \n \nFour-Year High Schools \n \nSan Jose (serves northeast)                  64.7 \n \nLincoln (serves northwest)                   50.2 \n \nThree-Year High Schools \n \nWillow Glen (serves attendance \n  area crossing entire district, \n  south of San Jose and Lincoln \n  attendance areas)                          13.6 \n \nPioneer (serves attendance area \n  crossing entire district, south of \n  Willow Glen)                                8.1 \n \nLeland (serves south)                         3.4 \n \nTwo-Year Junior High Schools \n \nBurnett (serves northeast)                   66.9 \n \nHoover (serves northwest)                    42.8 \n \nThree-Year Junior High Schools \n \nMarkham (serves attendance area \n  crossing entire district, south of \n  Burnett and Hoover)                        18.4 \n \nMuir (serves attendance area \n  crossing entire district, south \n  of Markham)                                 8.6 \n \nBret Harte (serves south)                     3.4 \n4. Assignment of portables and administration of double sessions. Portable classrooms are \nmoveable and designed for quick temporary service. The district owns over 400 portable \nclassrooms which are distributed throughout 39 of the district's 42 schools. In addition, the \ndistrict leased 112 portable classrooms to house students pending reconstruction of Field \nAct schools. \nIn assigning portable classrooms, the district has \"followed a policy of picking them up and \nmoving them around to schools to accommodate whatever the needs are at that particular \nschool.\" The district has never used portable location to improve ethnic balance. \n \n\n \n \n \nThe district has used portables to create schools on sites in the imbalanced northern \ndowntown area. In the Fall of 1973, seven downtown schools were totally constructed from \nportable classrooms. 323*323 No consideration has been given to transporting northern \nstudents to a southern suburban school. \nStudents in the southern suburban part of the district have been overcrowded in their \npresent facilities. As a temporary measure, until new construction is completed, the \nsouthern schools have conducted double sessions. The double-session relief measure did \nnot alter the ethnic makeup of the southern schools, which, with a heavy concentration of \nAnglo students, are ethnically imbalanced. \nIn the school year 1973-1974, the two junior high schools located at the southernmost part \nof the district conducted double sessions. John Muir High School, with a student capacity of \n1,554, serviced 2,167 students; Bret Harte Junior High School, with a student capacity of \n1,764, serviced 2,220 students. Both southern junior high schools were severely \nimbalanced: the percentage of Spanish-surnamed students totalled 8.6% at John Muir and \n3.4% at Bret Harte. The two northern junior high schools remaining after closure of \nRoosevelt and Wilson were also imbalanced: the student enrollment at Burnett was 66.9% \nSpanish-surnamed, while the student population at Hoover was 42.8% Spanish-surnamed. \nThus, the district was operating four ethnically imbalanced junior high schools. The fifth, \nMarkham Junior High School, with 18.4% Spanish-surnamed students, approached racial \nbalance. The district could have relieved congestion in the southern schools and improved \nethnic balance in all junior high schools by transporting students from southern facilities to \nthe undercapacity northern schools. \nAt a school board meeting on May 2, 1974, a group of Anglo parents demanded that their \nchildren be relieved of double sessions at Muir and Bret Harte junior high schools. On May \n16, the board responded by authorizing inter-district transfers permitting Anglo students to \nattend schools outside their neighborhood attendance areas for the 1974-1975 and 1975-\n1976 school years.[9] Executive sessions of the board met with the district superintendent \nand the board attorney to reevaluate the newly-enacted authorization of inter-district \ntransfers. Counsel for the board advised the district that the court in this litigation might \nadversely interpret deviation from the board's stated adherence to a neighborhood school \npolicy, in circumstances which relieved crowding while perpetuating ethnic imbalance. On \nJune 20, 1974, after receiving this advice, the board rescinded its transfer resolution. \nBecause the resolution was rescinded two months after passage, no student actually \ntransferred from the district to a neighboring school. \nAlthough district officials agree that double sessions are educationally undesirable, the \ndistrict has maintained double sessions at Bret Harte and John Muir pending construction of \nnew junior high schools in the southern suburban part of the district. When completed, \nthese schools will almost certainly open as imbalanced schools, since they will serve Anglo \nattendance areas. \n \n\n \n \n \nFaced with overcrowding at Pioneer High School, a southern suburban facility with a 5.7% \nSpanish-surnamed population, the board transferred students to Leland High School, an \nadjacent southern facility with a 4.1% Spanish-surnamed population. Increased ethnic \nbalance would have resulted from board action transferring the Pioneer students to San \nJose High School, a northeastern facility separated from Pioneer by the bordering Willow \nGlen attendance area. Although San Jose High School, with a 59.6% Spanish-surnamed \nstudent enrollment, was operating undercapacity, the district failed to transport any Pioneer \nstudents to San Jose High School. \n324*324 \n                    TABLE 6 \n \n       Schools on Double Session — 1973 \n \nSchool               Grades             Location \n \nAllen                2-3-4              Suburban \nAlmaden       All elementary grades     Suburban \nErickson             4-5                Suburban \nHenderson            2-3                Suburban \nSimonds              2-3-4              Suburban \nTerrell              1-2                Suburban \nValley View   All elementary grades     Suburban \nWashington           3-4-5-6            Downtown \nHarte                 7-8-9             Suburban \nMuir                  7-8-9             Suburban \n5. Transportation. For years, the board has authorized student transportation in the San \nJose Unified School District for nonintegration purposes. In the past five years, bussing has \ndramatically increased in the district: the number of transported students has doubled from \n5,000 in 1969 to 10,000 in 1973; the total cost of student transportation has escalated from \n$338,339 in 1969 to $853,380 in 1973. Indeed, bussing has become routine and \nwidespread: all but 14 schools in the district currently employ student transportation; in the \nschool year 1973-1974, 10,431 out of 36,000 students were bussed daily. \nAll bussing has occurred within attendance areas. No student has travelled by bus from his \nresidential attendance area to a school in a contiguous or more distant attendance area. \nThus, bussing has always been used in a manner consistent with a neighborhood school \npolicy. \nFaced with the physical and demographic makeup of the district — with a concentration of \nAnglo students in the southern suburban area and Spanish-surnamed students in the \nnorthern downtown core — the board could have relieved ethnic imbalance in the schools \nonly by bussing students among attendance areas. \"Two-way bussing,\" in the judgment of \nDr. Knight, the Task Group and the Westinghouse Learning Corporation, is a necessary \ningredient in any desegregation plan. \n \n\n \n \n \nAlthough aware of the impossibility of desegregation without wide-scale transportation, the \nboard repeatedly declared itself opposed to bussing for integration. As early as 1963, the \nboard, through resolution, assured the community of its opposition to bussing for \nintegration; the board has not deviated from this position. \n6. Bond issue elections. On February 11, 1969, a bond election was held in the district. The \ndistrict divided the bond issue into two provisions (although they could have combined them \ninto one package): Proposition A authorized the sale of bonds to finance reconstruction of \nField Act schools in the northern downtown area; Proposition B authorized the sale of bonds \nto finance growth of the school system in the southern suburban area. The voters passed \nonly the bonds for reconstruction of the Field Act schools. \nAs drafted, the bonds insured the rebuilding of each northern downtown school on site in \nthe same locale. However, the board was under no legal compulsion to rebuild on site in the \nsame general area. \nThe district scheduled another bond election for February 9, 1971. This proposal included a \ntax rate increase measure for operating revenues only (Proposition I), and an unrestricted \n7% bond issue totaling 15 million dollars (Proposition II). Proposition II authorized 8.3 million \ndollars to subsidize growth and 6.7 million dollars to refinance Field Act construction since \nthe low interest rate authorized by the 1969 measure rendered it unusable. \nPrior to the 1971 election, the board issued a public statement assuring the voters that \"this \nBoard will commit itself to the continuation of the present district philosophy of the \nneighborhood school and transportation for specific educational and safety reasons.\" Pro-\nbond material advised voters that if the bond issue were not passed, children presently \nattending northern downtown Field Act schools would necessarily be bussed to schools in \nthe southern portion of the district. Although the bond election was held on the day of a \nmajor Los Angeles earthquake, which destroyed public hospitals 325*325 and schools, only \nthe revenue measure passed. Funds for reconstruction of Field Act schools were obtained \non April 13, 1971, when the bond market interest rate fell below 5%, enabling the district to \nsell the bonds authorized by the 1969 election. \nThe district presented the voters with another growth bond issue on September 19, 1972. \nBoard-authorized bond material for this election promised voters that no bond money would \nsubsidize bussing. Bond literature further threatened that failure of the bond issue would \nresult in year-round schools as well as double sessions throughout the district. The voters \nrejected the bond issue. \nThe district attempted again to pass a growth measure on February 27, 1973. The board \nadvised the community that failure of the bond issue would result in double sessions \nthroughout the district and altered attendance boundaries designed to equalize student \nenrollment. These proposed changes, stated the board, \"would affect family living patterns \nof most people in the district.\" The voters rejected the bond authorization once more. \n \n\n \n \n \n7. QUEST. By resolution adopted January, 1963, the board called for a comprehensive \nstudy of racial and ethnic segregation in the school system. The resolution lay dormant for \nsix years. In December, 1969, in response to an official state notification of racial imbalance \nin the San Jose schools, the board reactivated the proposed study by creating the Quality \nUrban Education Study Team (QUEST). The role of this board-appointed citizens' group \nwas limited to investigating imbalance and formulating corrective proposals; ultimate \napproval and implementation authority remained with the board. \nAlthough integration necessarily requires transportation across attendance areas, the board \nrepeatedly discouraged QUEST from including mandatory bussing in any integration \nproposal. Following several board meetings, the board issued a series of public statements \nagainst mass bussing. Faced with public pressure, the board opened the membership of \nQUEST to all concerned citizens; broad-based representation of the community resulted in \na reconstituted, anti-bussing study group. The board ultimately modified its charge to \nQUEST relegating integration from the \"primary objective\" of the school district to a \"long \nterm . . . priority.\" \nIn its final majority report, QUEST proposed to eliminate segregation through (1) magnet \nschools, (2) open enrollment policies, and (3) voluntary bussing. By 1973, the board had \nadopted neither the QUEST majority proposals nor the minority committee suggestion of \neducational parks. \n8. Faculty and staff assignment. The district assigned most Spanish-surnamed teachers to \npredominantly Spanish-surnamed schools. Of the 1,531 classroom teachers employed by \nthe district in 1973, 89 (5%) were Spanish-surnamed; of these 89 teachers, 54 (over 60%) \nwere assigned to 16 downtown schools. Of the 189 administrators, counselors and resource \npersonnel employed by the district in 1973, 20 were Spanish-surnamed; of these 20, 18 \n(90%) were assigned to northern downtown schools. \nDr. Knight testified that the board had consciously assigned Spanish-surnamed faculty \nmembers to northern schools based on perceived educational values. However, the record \nreflects that Spanish-surnamed teachers served in both northern and southern schools. \nPlaintiffs' witness, Peter Mesa, agreed with Dr. Knight that there was educational value in \nexposing Spanish-surnamed children to Spanish-surnamed teachers in the classroom. The \nhighest percentage of Spanish-surnamed faculty at any one time in one school was \napproximately 26%; another school had a 24% Spanish-surnamed teaching staff; in all \nother schools, the percentage of Spanish-surnamed faculty remained below 15%. On these \nstatistics, the schools cannot be characterized as identified by segregated faculty. \n9. Neighborhood school policy. The district has the authority to establish 326*326 and alter \nattendance boundaries; it approves all boundary lines. The district policy has been, and is, \nto require each student in the district to attend the school servicing the residence of the \nstudent's parents. The neighborhood school policy is designed for the convenience and \nsafety of the largest number of children; the school attempts to locate schools where it finds \nthe children, so that students live \"within walking distance of the school.\" Dr. Knight defined \n \n\n \n \n \na neighborhood school attendance area as \"an area that would as nearly as possible serve \nas many children in such a way that as many of them as possible could walk to school.\" \nThe neighborhood attendance policy is mandatory. The district has never permitted open \nenrollment. \nBetween 1963 and 1973, the district was aware that racial enrollment in each school mirrors \nthe ethnic composition of its surrounding neighborhood when site location and construction \npractices were coupled with a mandatory neighborhood school attendance policy. \nRecognizing the correlation between residence patterns and school enrollment, the board \nhas known that in designating attendance boundaries according to a neighborhood school \npolicy, it has simultaneously created racially imbalanced schools. As board member \nMcCreath testified: \nQ. Now, is it true that when you are dealing with an area where the population in that area is \npredominantly minority, that the so-called neighborhood school policy has the effect of \ncreating segregated schools? \nA. Yes. \nQ. And has the Board, since the time you have been on the Board been aware of this result \nof drawing the attendance district boundary lines in accordance with the neighborhood \nschool policy? \nA. Yes. \nIn formulating policies and procedures for facility construction or reconstruction, the district \nhas never deviated from the neighborhood school policy. The district has never changed \nattendance boundaries or reassigned students to effect integration in this district. \nSince 1965, the board has issued and reaffirmed a policy to establish attendance areas \nwhich would \"avoid the ultimate result of segregation of pupils by ethnic or racial \nsegregation.\" Dr. Knight testified that in his view the existing attendance boundaries were \ntoo rigid and have tended to create ethnic barriers with resulting racial isolation in the school \nsystem. Dr. Knight concluded that the district could not feasibly \"keep a neighborhood \nschool policy in its pure form and at the same time have integration.\" \nOn November 9, 1970, the board in a formal policy statement reaffirmed its commitment to \nthe district philosophy of the neighborhood school. \nC. District's Failure to Desegregate in Violation of \nBoard Policy and State Statutory Requirements \n1. Board policy. As early as 1962, the board recognized the need for integration. In a 1963 \nresolution, the board officially acknowledged the existence of ethnic imbalance in the school \nsystem and resolved to undertake a comprehensive study designed to overcome \"the evils \n \n\n \n \n \nproduced by such school segregation.\" In 1965, the board pledged to consider segregatory \npatterns in establishing attendance area boundaries. \nPlaintiffs argue that the following board actions violated the board's own stated policy: (1) \ndelay in commencing a meaningful study of segregation; (2) interference with QUEST; (3) \nfailure to adopt and implement QUEST recommendations; (4) adherence to mandatory \nneighborhood school attendance areas without bussing; (5) site selection and designation \nof boundaries for new schools; (6) drafting bond material for replacement of Field Act \nschools; and (7) site selection and attendance area designation for reconstructed Field Act \nschools. Plaintiffs contend that, while 327*327 this pattern of conduct alone demonstrates \ncompelling evidence of segregative intent, it provides conclusive evidence of segregative \nintent when contrasted to the stated board policy and unfulfilled board promises. \n2. State policy. Title 5 of the California Administrative Code, defining racial and ethnic \nfactors in school attendance practices, was law in California from 1962 to 1972. On October \n23, 1962, the State Board of Education first filed administrative guidelines outlining the \nobligations of school districts in establishing attendance areas. The regulations mandated \nschool boards to consider the ethnic composition of immediate and peripheral areas, to \nevaluate the impact of proposed boundary designation on ethnic balance, to formulate \nalternative plans, and to avoid, \"as far as practicable\" attendance areas which establish or \nmaintain ethnic segregation. (Article 1.5 of Title 5 of the California Administrative Code, § \n2010 filed October 23, 1962, effective 30 days thereafter [Register 62, Number 22].) \nSection 2010, added to Title 5 in 1962, did not specifically legislate attendance practices or \nsite selection. However, on February 23, 1963, the State Board amended the 1962 \nprovisions to require school districts to analyze attendance practices, as well as attendance \nareas in attempting to eliminate segregation. (Cal.Admin.Code Title 5, §§ 2010, 2011, \namendment filed Feb. 20, 1963, effective 30 days thereafter [Register 63, No. 3].) These \nprovisions were not amended until 1969. \nBy amendments filed February 21, 1969, effective 30 days thereafter, the State Board of \nEducation: \n(a) expanded coverage to include school sites, as well as school attendance areas and \nschool attendance practices; \n(b) changed the word \"segregation\" to the word \"imbalance\"; \n(c) assigned \"high priority\" to the prevention and elimination of imbalance in all decisions \nrelating to school sites, school attendance areas and school attendance practices; \n(d) codified the existing administrative practice requiring school districts to conduct \nracial/ethnic surveys and compile data recording racial and ethnic makeup of grade levels \nand individual schools; \n \n\n \n \n \n(e) defined \"imbalance\" as a school in which one or more racial or ethnic groups differed by \nmore than 15 percentage points from the total percentage of that group within the entire \nschool system; and \n(f) required districts to formulate and evaluate corrective plans for imbalanced institutions, \nassigning high priority to elimination of racial or ethnic imbalance, and analyzing \"feasibility \nfactors,\" including existing demography, \"traditional factors used in site selection, boundary \ndetermination, and school organization by grade level,\" and \"the effect . . alternatives on the \neducational program.\" See Calif.Admin.Code, Title 5, §§ 2010, 2011, amendment filed \nFebruary 21, 1969, effective 30 days thereafter [Register 69, No. 8]. These sections were \nrenumbered without substantive change to sections 14020 and 14021 respectively by \namendment filed January 14, 1970, effective 30 days thereafter [Register 70, No. 3]. \nOn February 11, 1970, a court ordered desegregation of the Los Angeles Unified School \nDistrict, relying in part on Title 5; one month later, on March 13, 1970, the State Board of \nEducation issued urgency legislation repealing sections 14020 and 14021 of Title 5. \n[Register 70, No. 11, filed March 13, 1970, effective immediately as an emergency.] \nHowever, a Sacramento superior court subsequently determined that there existed no \nemergency and thus no justification for repeal without advance public notice. Consequently, \nthe State Board of Education reinstated sections 14020 and 14021 on June 25, 1970 \n[Register 70, No. 26]. \nIn 1971, Assemblyman Bagley introduced AB 724, which became law effective March 4, \n1972. This legislation, which codified and revised the administrative guidelines as California \nEducation 328*328 Code §§ 5002, 5003, amended the Title 5 provisions to: \n(1) eliminate the 15% rule and substitute \"significant\" difference from the district wide \npercentage as the governing standard for imbalance; \n(2) require affirmative plans and implementation schedules to eliminate imbalance and vest \napproval power in the State Department of Education; \n(3) order the State Board of Education to adopt rules and regulations for implementation of \ncode sections. (Calif.Stats. 1971, Ch. 1765.) \nOn November 7, 1972, the California electorate passed Proposition 21, which repealed the \nEducation Code sections and the Title 5 provisions. On January 15, 1975, the California \nSupreme Court upheld the voters' authority to repeal Title 5 provisions, noting that the \nadministrative regulations were matters of state policy not required by any constitutional or \nlegal mandate; the Court held that the provisions of Proposition 21 repealing Title 5 were \nseverable from the unconstitutional portions of the referendum, which sought to preclude \nschool districts from making assignments of students required by law. \nAs memorialized in correspondence and reports between the district and the State \nDepartment of Education, B.I.R., the board understood the statutory obligation to conduct \n \n\n \n \n \nstudies and formulate alternative plans designed toward reducing ethnic imbalance in the \nschool system. School district staff members presented the board with a report prepared on \nOctober 23, 1971, entitled \"Preliminary Decisions Regarding Integration.\" This report set \nforth a series of proposed decisions suggested for developing concrete policies for \nintegration. The report recommended that planning be placed so that district-wide \nintegration be achieved no later than the 1972-1973 or 1973-1974 school years. The board \nhas never acted on this report. \nAlthough the board has been aware of Title 5 requirements and has realized that adherence \nto a neighborhood school policy presents an obstacle to desegregation, the board has \nnever directed its staff to formulate alternative criteria for student assignment or to prepare \na plan for district-wide integration. \nThe district represented to the state in its progress reports that mandatory closing of Field \nAct schools would afford an opportunity to change attendance criteria and achieve progress \ntowards desegregation; implicit in these representations was a suggestion that the board \nwould take advantage of the opportunity. When the opportunity did arise in 1971, the board \nelected to rebuild the schools on the existing sites with the existing attendance areas, \nresulting in \"very little change\" in ethnic imbalance. \nThe district further advised the State Department of Education of progress toward \nintegration through the QUEST study of racial imbalance and recommendations for school \ndesegregation. After establishing QUEST, the board limited the scope of its inquiry by \neliminating mandatory mass bussing from consideration as an integration measure. The \nfinal QUEST report included three proposals: magnet schools, open enrollment, and \nvoluntary bussing. No action was taken on any QUEST proposal. \nUnder Title 5, school districts were required to consider the impact of site selection on \nethnic composition of existing schools in adjacent areas. In selecting sites for new facilities \nin the Anglo suburban area, the district has not applied the state's checklist for improved \nethnic balance. \nAlthough the board knew of the resources available at B.I.R., the district never requested \ntechnical assistance in drafting an integration plan. B.I.R. also scheduled special \ninformational seminars for school districts engaged in desegregation litigation; no board \nmember attended. \nV. DISCUSSION \nIn Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973), the \nSupreme Court held that 329*329 the desegregation mandate of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), is triggered only by a finding of \nintentional state discriminatory action. Affirming the dichotomy between actionable de \njure segregation and constitutionally permissible de facto imbalance, the Supreme Court \nstated: \"We emphasize that the differentiating factor between de jure segregation and so-\n \n\n \n \n \ncalled de facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to segregate.\" 413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. \nat 2697. In defining the quantum of state action necessary to sustain a finding of de \njure discrimination, Keyes sets forth three requirements: (1) the school system must in fact \nbe racially imbalanced; (2) state officials must have created or maintained ethnic imbalance; \nand (3) in creating or maintaining ethnic imbalance, state officials must have acted with \nsegregative intent. \nAnalysis of the San Jose Unified School District within this framework establishes that two \nof these three elements are satisfied. As the State Department of Education has found, as \nplaintiffs urge, and as defendants readily concede, the San Jose school system is \ncharacterized by marked racial imbalance.[10] Moreover, while school officials did not create \nthe imbalance, state action has perpetuated existing ethnic composition: by rebuilding the \nField Act schools on site, and by adopting a neighborhood school policy to govern school \nassignment in a racially segregated community, the school board has maintained the \nexisting imbalance. This litigation focuses therefore on the third element of Keyes; the \ncentral inquiry of this lawsuit is whether the numerous school board actions detailed above \nwere motivated by segregative intent. \nIn the wake of Keyes, two lines of judicial authority have developed on the definition of \nsegregative intent in school litigation. Several courts have held that a presumption of \nsegregative intent arises once plaintiffs establish that \"school authorities have engaged in \nacts or omissions, the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of which is to bring \nabout or maintain segregation.\" United States v. School District of Omaha, 521 F.2d 530 \n(8th Cir. 1975); Hart v. Community School Board of Education, New York School District # \n21, 512 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1975); Oliver v. Michigan State Board of Education, 508 F.2d 178 \n(6th Cir. 1974); Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 467 F.2d 142 (5th \nCir. 1972) (pre-Keyes). See also, Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580, 588-589 (1st Cir. \n1974), aff'g, 379 F.Supp. 410 (D.Mass.1974). \nOther courts have reasoned that intent includes the concept of \"purpose\" within its \ndefinition. Higgins v. Board of Education, City of Grand Rapids, 508 F.2d 779, 793 (6th Cir. \n1974) (there is an apparent conflict between Higgins and Oliver, both Sixth Circuit \ncases); Husbands v. Pennsylvania, 395 F.Supp. 1107 (E.D. Pa.1975). \nAlthough a pre-Keyes opinion contains the language of \"foreseeable consequences,\" the \nNinth Circuit's post-Keyes decisions have adopted the \"purpose\" rather than the \n\"foreseeable\" standard of unconstitutional segregation. In Kelly v. Guinn, 456 F.2d 100 (9th \nCir. 1972), decided prior to Keyes, the court cautioned that \"[w]e do not mean to suggest \nthat we would agree with plaintiffs' assumption that the Constitution is not violated by \nimplementation of a `neighborhood school' policy in a school district having racially \nsegregated residential patterns when the foreseeable result [is] segregation of the races in \nthe district's schools. That question remains open.\" 456 F.2d at 106 n. 7. Even in the same \nopinion, however, the court analyzed the \"school district's purpose in \nconstructing, 330*330 renovating, and abandoning schools . . .\" 456 F.2d at 108 (emphasis \nadded). \n \n\n \n \n \nAfter Keyes, the Ninth Circuit clarified the appropriate standard for unconstitutional school \nboard action. In Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees, 488 F.2d 579 (9th Cir. \n1973), the district court granted summary judgment against the school board on a theory \nthat \"the School Board's accountability for its segregated schools resulting as a natural, \nforeseeable consequence of its acts and omissions remains open for this court's \nconsideration, regardless of any discriminatory motives behind such acts.\" 488 F.2d at 585. \nThe trial court expressly rejected a defense based on lack of discriminatory segregative \nmotivation, ruling that \"the Board's contention that it had never intentionally or purposefully \nsegregated its school system did not raise a disputed question of material fact for purposes \nof summary judgment.\" Id. Reversing, the Ninth Circuit, citing Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971), cautioned against \"blaming the school district for other factors which may have \ncontributed to some extent to the composition of schools,\" and held that the school board \ncould not be held liable for racial imbalance in the school system absent a finding of \nsegregative intent. The case was remanded to the district court for proof on the school \nboard's claims that \"only legitimate educational interests motivated its actions, and . . . it \nhad [no] intent to create or maintain segregated schools.\" 488 F.2d at 587. \nFollowing Soria, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the \"purposeful\" standard of segregative intent. \nIn Johnson v. San Francisco Unified School District, 500 F.2d 349 (9th Cir. 1974), the Ninth \nCircuit remanded a San Francisco school desegregation case for a finding on segregative \nintent, stating: \nThis court, in Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees, 488 F.2d 579 (9th Cir. \n1973), has construed Keyes as requiring for any finding of unconstitutional segregation a \n\"determination that the school authorities had intentionally discriminated against minority \nstudents by practicing a deliberate policy of racial segregation.\" \n500 F.2d 349, 351 (emphasis added). \nThus, under the Ninth Circuit formulation of the standard for unconstitutional de \njure segregation, the school board is precluded only from practicing a purposeful policy of \nracial separation in the school system; the district is under no affirmative duty to improve \nracial balance in the schools. However, where the school board claims that actions which \nperpetuated racial imbalance were motivated by proper educational concerns, it is the \nfunction of the trial court to scrutinize closely the school board decision-making process to \nassure that false or facile justifications do not mask purposeful discrimination. We now \nexamine the policies and actions of the San Jose Unified School District, to determine \nwhether they indicate unconstitutional segregative intent under the Ninth Circuit standard \ndiscussed above. \nA. Site Selection and School Construction \nPlaintiffs stress that of nine new facilities constructed since 1965, all opened as imbalanced \nschools. The school board constructed all of these facilities in the southern suburban \n \n\n \n \n \nportion of the district to meet the growing suburban student population. In erecting schools \nwhere the students were located, the school board followed its neighborhood school policy. \nPlaintiffs have provided no evidence that in constructing new southern schools, the school \nboard gerrymandered or otherwise tampered with school attendance boundaries. The \nrecord discloses that in selecting sites for southern schools, the board failed to consider the \nstate's checklist for evaluation of attendance areas; however, consideration of the state's \nethnic criteria would clearly 331*331 have been futile, since adherence to a neighborhood \nschool policy in the southern suburban portion of the district would necessarily result in \nracially imbalanced schools. Thus, the issue raised by site selection, as well as other school \nboard actions, is whether the neighborhood school system is itself constitutional when \nengrafted on to racially segregated neighborhoods. This question will be discussed below. \nB. Replacement of Field Act Schools \nIn rebuilding the Field Act schools, the board adhered to the neighborhood school policy \nand rebuilt virtually all the schools on their original sites. The two facilities, Olinder and \nAlmaden, which were constructed on different sites, were built within the existing \nattendance areas. \nIn electing to reconstruct the northern schools within the original attendance areas, the \nboard passed up opportunities to improve ethnic balance in the school system. For \nexample, alternatives to rebuilding Lincoln Glen and Washington existed which would have \nameliorated imbalance. From a policy standpoint, the board's action may be condemned. \nThe court cannot, however, say that in applying the neighborhood school policy and \nrebuilding the schools within the existing area the board violated the Constitution: to hold \nthat such action constitutes segregative conduct would be to cast on the school board an \naffirmative duty to improve ethnic balance; this the Ninth Circuit has refused to do. Soria v. \nOxnard School District Board of Trustees, supra; Johnson v. San Francisco Unified School \nDistrict, supra. \nC. Closure of Schools \nPlaintiffs argue that discriminatory intent is shown by a series of board actions in closing \ncertain schools, combining attendance areas, and dispersing students to adjacent facilities. \nAs detailed above, these actions include the closures of Longfellow, Bascom, College Park, \nBelden, Jefferson, Wilson and Roosevelt. \nIn 1971, the board closed Longfellow Elementary School and combined its attendance area \nwith Hester. A comparison of the racial composition of adjacent attendance areas shows \nthat from the standpoint of minimizing ethnic imbalance, combination with Hester was the \nbest available alternative within the constraints of the neighborhood school policy. Similarly, \nwhen the school board closed Bascom Elementary School and assigned its students to \n \n\n \n \n \nTrace, it selected the best ethnic alternative available under the neighborhood school policy \nfrom the adjacent facilities. \nIn 1973, the district closed College Park, Belden and Jefferson schools and consolidated \ntheir attendance areas with Bachrodt. A comparison of adjacent attendance areas shows \nthat in each case Bachrodt was the best choice from an ethnic standpoint. \nThe closures of Wilson and Roosevelt junior high schools present more complicated fact \nsituations. After Wilson was closed, its attendance area was dispersed among the three \nadjacent junior high school attendance areas, two to the north and one to the south, and \none high school attendance area to the north. In selecting receiving schools, the district \nfollowed its neighborhood school policy. In each case, the students from Wilson found \nthemselves at a school where ethnic imbalance was lower after their arrival than it had been \nat Wilson. Naturally, the number and percentage of Spanish-surnamed students at each of \nthe receiving schools increased; the most imbalanced junior high school was, however, \neliminated. Although the changes improved imbalance from the viewpoint of the Wilson \nstudents, they aggravated it from the viewpoint of students at receiving schools. On the \nwhole, however, the court finds that the changes did not significantly aggravate imbalance \nin the district. \nThe elimination of the Roosevelt school attendance areas and reassignment 332*332 of \nstudents had no significant impact on ethnic imbalance. Moreover, the changes were \nconformity with a neighborhood school policy; the alternative options available to the board \neach required deviation from the neighborhood school policy. \nD. Use of Portables and Double Sessions \nIn allocating portable classrooms to existing facilities, the school board has used mobile \nunits in accordance with its neighborhood school policy, to allow students to remain in their \nresidential attendance area. \nPlaintiffs stress the fact that the board instituted educationally undesirable double sessions \nin the southern portion of the district rather than transporting students to the undercapacity \nnorthern schools. While one may disagree with this choice, it demonstrates not racial \nanimus but only strict adherence to the neighborhood school policy. The only deviation from \nthe neighborhood school policy was the board's authorization for inter-district transfers from \nthe congested Bret Harte and Muir junior high schools. Since this short-lived resolution was \nsoon rescinded, no student transferred under the proposed plan. \nE. Transportation \nPlaintiffs emphasize that while the district uses extensive student transportation, the board \nhas never implemented —or even considered—bussing for integrative purposes. This \nevidence shows only that the district has failed to achieve a perfect \"walking distance\" \n \n\n \n \n \nsystem. However, all student transportation is within attendance areas; thus, the district's \nbussing policy is consistent with its neighborhood school policy. The record discloses no \nevidence that an equal amount of student transportation could have improved racial balance \nin the school system. This is a far cry from the once-common case where minority students \nwere bussed past an undercapacity Anglo facility to attend a racially isolated \nschool. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 725, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). \nF. Bond Issue Elections \nAs discussed above, reconstruction of Field Act facilities within existing attendance areas \ndid not violate the Constitution. Thus, the fact that the provisions of the bond issue \nsubmitted at the February, 1969, election limited funds to rebuilding on site cannot \nconstitute a constitutional violation if the reconstruction itself was permissible. \nAfter passage of the 1969 bond election, decline in interest rates rendered the bonds \nunsalable and necessitated a second bond election for reconstruction of Field Act \nreconstruction. Pro-bond literature in the 1971 election was factually accurate in its \nrepresentation that failure to rebuild northern schools would result in northern students \ntransferring to southern schools. Some pro-bond voters may have been motivated by a fear \nor dislike of Spanish-surnamed students in southern facilities; however, they may also have \nbeen motivated by a fear of congestion or a multitude of other considerations. It is difficult to \nspeculate on the voters' reactions to pro-bond literature; at any rate, the bonds did not pass. \nThe court finds that the factually accurate statements of the board do not establish \nsegregative intent. \nThe repeated assurances during various bond elections that no funds would subsidize \nbussing may have assured voters who feared forced integration. However, if there was no \naffirmative constitutional obligation to bus, these pro-bond representations cannot form the \nbasis for a finding of segregative intent. \nG. QUEST \nThe record shows that the board was less than supportive of QUEST. However, the board \nhad no affirmative duty to integrate; thus, the failure to adopt or implement an integration \nplan does not show segregative intent. Nor is purposeful segregation shown by the board's \ndiscouraging QUEST from focusing on bussing as a cornerstone to an \nintegration 333*333 plan; as stated above, extensive bussing would violate—if not destroy— \nthe district's long standing neighborhood school policy. \nH. Faculty and Staff Assignment \nAs noted in the presentation of facts, no school in the district can be identified by its \nsegregated faculty. The board did intentionally assign Spanish-surnamed faculty members \n \n\n \n \n \nto predominantly Spanish-surnamed schools; the board also assigned Spanish-surnamed \nteachers to Anglo schools. \nCourts have frequently condemned segregation of faculty. Segregation in the assignment of \nfaculty and staff \" . . . [is] among the most important indicia of a segregated system.\" Swann \nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 18, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1277, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971). Discrimination in the assignment of faculty and staff violates the Constitution \nindependently of the segregation of students. United States v. Montgomery County Bd. of \nEduc., 395 U.S. 225, 89 S.Ct. 1670, 23 L.Ed.2d 263 (1969); Bradley v. School Bd. of City of \nRichmond, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965); Davis v. School District of \nPontiac, 309 F.Supp. 734 (E.D. Mich.1970) aff'd, 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 \nU.S. 913, 92 S.Ct. 233, 30 L.Ed.2d 186 (1971). In the context of discrimination against \nBlacks, assignment of teachers on the basis of skin color is justly condemned since no \neducational rationale can be advanced to support racial isolation among faculty. In a suit \nsuch as this involving discrimination against Spanish-surnamed Americans, the problem is \ncomplicated by language differences. Students for whom English is a second language may \nor may not need teachers who share their primary language. Proper analysis of this \nproblem requires information on the percentage of Spanish-surnamed students who benefit \nfrom bilingual teachers and the extent to which only Spanish-surnamed instructors may \nassist the special problems of bilingual students. Many Spanish-surnamed students are \nperfectly fluent in English. Moreover, Spanish-surnamed teachers have no monopoly on \nspeaking Spanish. Unfortunately, no party produced evidence on these questions at trial. \nConsidering that the percentage of minority teachers in any school is small, that Spanish-\nspeaking teachers may benefit Spanish-speaking students, and that Spanish-surnamed \nteachers have been assigned positions at Anglo schools, the court does not find that district \npractices violate the Constitution. \nThe court further finds that assignment of minority teachers in this case does not in any \nmanner contribute to ethnic imbalance of students in the schools. Even if the assignment \npractices in the district were unconstitutional, the appropriate remedy would relate solely to \nfaculty assignment and not to student attendance policies. If the assignment of students is \notherwise constitutional, it should not be disturbed simply because minority teachers have \nbeen assigned to those schools which have constitutionally permissible percentages of \nminority students. Higgins v. Board of Education of City of Grand Rapids, supra, at 787. \nI. Failure to Integrate Despite State and Board \nIntegration Policies \nPlaintiffs argue that segregative intent may be found from the fact that the board adopted a \npublic policy favoring integration but then failed to achieve its stated goal. Throughout the \ntime in question, the board adhered to the neighborhood school policy. Complete integration \nand a neighborhood school policy are incompatible in the San Jose Unified School District. \n \n\n \n \n \nPlaintiffs' argument is somewhat unfair to a board facing numerous complex decisions. Had \nthe board failed to state that integration was a worthy objective, plaintiffs could not attack it \nfor unfulfilled promises. Defendants should not be hanged by their own rope simply because \nthey recognized the racial imbalance in the school system, but adhered 334*334 to the \nneighborhood school policy rather than taking affirmative action to integrate. \nPlaintiffs also urge the court to find segregative intent from the defendants' failure to \nintegrate despite an alleged state-imposed duty. It is clear that the district failed to \nimplement integration proposals. However, the record is ambiguous both as to the nature of \nthe duty imposed and the board's response. As shown above, the state integration \nguidelines did not impose an absolute affirmative obligation to integrate the district; the \nguidelines were qualified by other educational considerations. Moreover, the state duty was \nin constant flux: between 1969 and 1972, the guidelines were strengthened, repealed, \nordered reinstated, reinstated, modified by legislative action and ultimately repealed by the \nelectorate. Throughout this period, the district worked with the QUEST committee, the \nBuilding Master Plan Task Group and state consultants in an attempt to discharge its \nobligations. The court does not find evidence of segregative intent from the district's failure \nto integrate during the years the state guidelines were in effect. \nJ. Neighborhood School Policy \nThe court finds that the district has consistently adhered to a neighborhood school policy. \nThe board has applied this policy neutrally: the record discloses no attempts to gerrymander \nattendance boundaries or otherwise manipulate attendance areas to lock in minorities or \nfreeze segregated school patterns. \nPlaintiffs repeatedly argue that defendants failed to take advantage of alternatives that \nwould have reduced ethnic imbalance. In discussing the facts, the court has noted the \nrejected alternatives. The court may disagree with the policy of the board in pursuing other \neducational goals over improved ethnic balance. If, however, neutral adherence to a \nneighborhood school policy is constitutional, this court has no authority to intervene and \norder integration. \nThe critical issue in this litigation is thus whether a school board may apply a neighborhood \nschool policy. Plaintiffs cite two cases in support of their argument that a neighborhood \nschool policy is unconstitutional. In Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, Virginia, 397 \nF.2d 37 (4th Cir. 1968), the court held that school assignment by neighborhood school \npolicy was impermissible, where Norfolk had operated a dual school system in the past and, \nthus, had a duty to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Plaintiffs in Brewer also \ncharged that the school board gerrymandered attendance areas for racial purposes. By the \ntime of trial, the school system used attendance zones with several schools in a zone; \nstudents had freedom of choice to attend any school within the attendance area. The \n\"geographical zoning plan\" had been adopted without redrawing existing boundary lines, \nwhich had been used in the past for a modified freedom of choice plan. Brewer is \ndistinguishable from the present case in that the case involved a statutory dual school \n \n\n \n \n \nsystem. In striking down the Norfolk plan, the court did observe that \"[a]ssignment of pupils \nto neighborhood schools is a sound concept, but it cannot be approved if residence in a \nneighborhood is denied to Negro pupils solely on the ground of color.\" 397 F.2d at 42. \nThe second case cited by plaintiffs is Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 311 \nF.Supp. 501 (D.C.Cal.1970), in which the district court held that a neighborhood school \npolicy is unconstitutional when it results in imbalanced schools. The court ruled that \"[u]nder \nthe Fourteenth Amendment a public school body has an obligation to act affirmatively to \npromote integration.\" 311 F.Supp. at 521. This decision, relying in part on Brewer, was \nhanded down three years before the Supreme Court spelled out the requirement of \nsegregative intent in Keyes. Spangler was never reviewed by the Ninth Circuit because the \nschool board acquiesced in the court's order. 427 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1975). In 335*335 view \nof these facts, this court is not disposed to follow Spangler. \nSeveral cases have approved neutral adherence to a neighborhood school policy. In Oliver \nv. Michigan Board of Education, supra, 508 F.2d 178, 182 (6th Cir. 1974), the Sixth Circuit \nheld that a school board could rebut the presumption of segregative intent by establishing \nthat its conduct was \"a consistent and resolute application of racially neutral policies.\" 508 \nF.2d at 182. This same court expressly approved adherence to a racially neutral \nneighborhood school policy even though it resulted in ethnic imbalance in the school \nsystem. Higgins v. Board of Education of City of Grand Rapids, supra, 508 F.2d 779, 783, \n791 (6th Cir. 1974). \nThe Ninth Circuit has commented on the neighborhood school policy in Johnson v. San \nFrancisco Unified School District, supra: \nThe Court in Keyes specifically reserved the issue of \"whether a `neighborhood school \npolicy' of itself will justify racial or ethnic concentrations in the absence of a finding that \nschool authorities have committed acts constituting de jure segregation.\" 413 U.S. at 212, \n93 S.Ct. at 2699. \nWe understand the reserved question to be whether it is sufficient to show intentional \ndiscriminatory action by someone other than the school board resulting in racially divided \nneighborhoods, to which the school board applies a \"neutral\" neighborhood school policy. \nCf. Kelly v. Guinn, 456 F.2d 99, 106 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1972). Engrafting a neighborhood school \npolicy onto such involuntary neighborhoods may be sufficient ratification of the illicit intent of \nothers to preclude the necessity for showing a purpose by the school board itself to \nsegregate. \n500 F.2d at 351, n. 1. \nThis language indicates that a neighborhood school policy is constitutionally suspect only \nwhere the neighborhoods which define school attendance areas are themselves products of \nofficial state discriminatory action. In the present case, plaintiffs produced no evidence of \nstate-approved restrictive covenants, discriminatory zoning, or other racially-motivated state \naction shaping the demographic and ethnic makeup of the San Jose Unified School District. \n \n\n \n \n \nSince the school board applied the neighborhood school policy neutrally, it follows that the \nrecord is barren of evidence of state discriminatory action on the part of the school board or \nany other political entity. \nFrom a policy standpoint, much can be said for the neighborhood school system. In this day \nof ever-increasing centralization, the average citizen has less and less control over his life. \nDecisions by distant bureaucrats appear unresponsive to a citizen's wishes. Transporting \nstudents to schools far from home only increases the feeling that the parent is powerless to \naffect school policy, or to participate in the educational process. Neighborhood schools \nallow parental involvement in the life of the school. Additionally, time and safety \nconsiderations both support the use of neighborhood schools, especially for younger \nchildren. This court is not attempting to provide the definitive word on education; these \ncomments are simply to indicate that the neighborhood school system is at the least a \nreasonable approach to education. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nThe court finds that defendants, who consistently adhered to a neighborhood school policy, \nhave never acted with segregative intent. The schools are, therefore, not unconstitutionally \nsegregated; and this court has no authority to order integration. As the Supreme Court \nstated in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra: \nIt is important to remember that judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a \nconstitutional violation. Remedial judicial authority does not put judges automatically in the \nshoes of school authorities whose powers are plenary. Judicial authority enters only when \nlocal authority defaults. \n402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276. \n336*336 We do not, however, intend to brand the current allocation of students with a judicial \nimprimatur, or to discourage the school board from attempting to improve racial balance in \nthe school system. Nothing decided here is intended to inhibit the school board from \nseeking creative solutions to the problem of ethnic imbalance or to deter the community \nfrom supporting such efforts. \nThis opinion shall constitute the findings of fact and conclusions of law under Rule 52 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n[1] Lincoln Glen was not mentioned in the body of the complaint, but was included in the prayer and in the Application \nfor Temporary Restraining Order and the Order to Show Cause. \n[2] Longfellow and Edison operated on the same campus, which is no longer the case. Plaintiffs have not pressed \ntheir Edison claim, Edison serving the entire school district as a continuation/opportunity school. \n \n\n \n \n \n[3] Because construction bids had already been received on Hester and Lowell elementary schools, this court found \nthat the school district would suffer substantial harm if rebuilding of them were halted. College Park was inadvertently \nomitted from the Temporary Restraining Order. \n[4] This ignores a narrow corridor extending north to the bay in which there is no resident population. \n[5] \"Safety\" is determined by the particular traffic hazards, availability of sidewalks, distances to school, and the age \nand grade level of the students. \n[6] School buildings constructed under the supervision of the Department of General Services in accordance with \napproved plans were exempted from this requirement. \n[7] Before Bascom was built, Trace served the Bascom area. \n[8] The Bachrodt area had previously been served by College Park, and Jefferson had at one time served a portion of \nthe Belden attendance area. \n[9] No evidence was introduced at trial regarding the comparative distances between the adjacent southern schools \nand the undercapacity northern facilities. \n[10] There is no evidence, however, that the schools are imbalanced in any other respect, i. e., that there is an \ninequitable distribution of any educational resource — trained faculty, recreational or housing facilities, equipment, or \ntextbooks — disfavoring students at northern schools. \n \n ",
