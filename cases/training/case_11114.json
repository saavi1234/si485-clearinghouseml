    "summary": "<p>This summary seeks to describe how the Swann litigation influenced the desegregation of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS). For a more thorough analysis of this litigation and policy challenge through the present day, see Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow: School Desegregation and Resegregation in Charlotte (Roslyn Arlin Mickelson, et al. eds. 2015). For a complete discussion of the Supreme Court’s decision in Swann, see Bernard Schwartz, Swann's Way: The School Busing Case and the Supreme Court (1986). </p><p>On January 1, 1965, several Black schoolchildren filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, asked the court for an injunction barring schools from allocating educational opportunities based on race. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the assignment of Black children into Black schools was the result of school board policies. </p><p>In March 1965, the CMS Board of Education (the Board) proposed a plan to comply with the Supreme Court’s requirements of <i>Brown</i>. On April 11, the Board approved a plan that would primarily eliminate race as a factor in the employment and assignment of all staff. Plaintiffs in this case argued the plan failed to meet the requirements of <i>Brown</i> by allowing school zones to be gerrymandered to prevent the mixing of races in schools, exempting 10 schools without a legitimate reason, and taking effect in the distant future rather than immediately. </p><p>At trial in the Western District of North Carolina, parties focused on the gerrymandering issue. Out of 75,000 students in the district, of which 23,000 were black and 52,000 were white, roughly 2,000 black students would be assigned to students largely populated by white students. In 99 out of 109 schools in the district, children were assigned according to their place of residence in a geographical zone, and all children were allowed to transfer to another zone for any reason. </p><p>Judge Craven found that it was reasonable to provide a maximum delay for excepted schools given the complexity of the zoning problem and that there was no evidence the gerrymandering was done for the purpose of preventing mixtures of Black and white students. He therefore approved the Board’s proposed plan, although required that it be done “immediately” rather than “ultimately.” <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 243 F. Supp. 667 (W.D.N.C. 1965). </p><p>Plaintiffs appealed to the Fourth Circuit. The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that zone lines should be drawn with the purpose of eliminating as many single-race schools as possible, concluding there is no constitutional requirement that school boards achieve the maximum mixture of races. In drawing school zone boundaries, the court declared that a Board may consider natural geographic boundaries, accessibility of particular schools, and other factors not related to race. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 369 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1966). </p><p>Plaintiffs then filed a motion for further relief in the district court. Judge McMillan ruled that CMS’s desegregation was not proceeding in accordance with constitutional requirements. Resisting the Fourth Circuit’s opinion, the court declared that the “system of assigning pupils by ‘neighborhood,’ with ‘freedom of choice’ for both pupils and faculty, superimposed on an urban population pattern where Black residents have become concentrated almost entirely in one quadrant of a city of 270,000, is racially discriminatory.” The Board was required to submit a new plan by May 15, 1969 that would effectuate faculty desegregation by Fall 1969 and that would be “predominantly effective” in desegregating student bodies by the same time, to be completed by Fall 1970. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 300 F. Supp. 1358 (W.D.N.C. 1969). </p><p>After some delay, the Board submitted a new proposal, but the district court determined the plan was insufficient in achieving the desegregation of both student and faculty assignment, as well as in the school site selection and construction plans. The new plan, according to Judge McMillan, merely provided transportation for those seeking majority-to-minority transfers, and while that provision was approved, the remainder of the pupil assignment plan was rejected. The court specifically rejected a policy that would make athletes ineligible for participation until the next school year, finding that rule racially discriminatory. A new plan was to be submitted by September 4, 1969. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 300 F. Supp. 1381 (W.D.N.C. 1969). </p><p>After a revised plan was submitted to the court, it was approved for the 1969-1970 year only. It called for the closing of seven all-black schools and the assignment of their 3000 students to predominantly white schools scattered throughout the city. The plan would keep open one inner-city predominantly black school for students who did not with to be bused to predominantly white schools on the outskirts of the city. By the 1970-71 term, the plan intended for all schools in the system to have approximately the same proportion of white and black teachers, and included “compensatory education” programs for students. On the issue of student body desegregation, court warned against attempts to create a magnet school to attract black children away from desegregated assignments. The Board was forbidden from providing bus transportation to the allowed inner city school and from planning programs for black students there that were not offered to black students at integrated schools. </p><p>On December 2, 1969, the court appointed Dr. John Finger of Rhode Island to advise the court on how it could be desegregated. Both Finger and the Board proposed plans to the court on February 2 and 5, 1970. The Board plan left some schools segregated, while the Finger plan desegregated all schools. The court felt, given the Supreme Court’s recent decisions relating to Atlanta, Miami, and Chicago public schools, that a delay until September could not be justified. On February 5, Judge McMillan thus ordered significant steps in the integration of all CMS schools by May of that school year. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 311 F. Supp. 265 (W.D.N.C. 1970). </p><p>But on March 5, 1970, the Fourth Circuit issued a stay. In a May 26 decision on the merits, the court upheld the aspects of the order related to faculty, but vacated the decision on the grounds that the zoning plan for elementary schools and transportation for junior and senior high schools imposed undue burdens on those students. In reaching its decision the court insisted that reasonableness, not “absolutes,” were to guide desegregation efforts. And while the court was concerned with the burden posed by the busing plan, it asserted that their opinion “should not be interpreted to prohibit all busing.” <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 431 F.2d 138 (4th Cir. 1970). </p><p>On June 29, 1970, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari as long as the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings and that the district court's previous judgment was reinstated pending those judgments. 399 U.S. 926 (1970). On remand, Judge McMillan held hearings during July 1970 and issued a new order on August 3. In reviewing the Board’s proposed plan, the court found the Board had not obeyed the Court of Appeals’ order to use “all reasonable means” to desegregate elementary schools, and that only the February 5 plan would suffice. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 318 F. Supp. 786 (W.D.N.C. 1970). </p><p>The Board next requested that the Fourth Circuit stay the district court's order, pending a decision of the Supreme Court. But on August 17, Judge Haynsworth declined to issue a stay, finding the Supreme Court had not authorized Courts of Appeals to review subsequent orders of the District Courts. </p><p>On April 20, 1971, a unanimous United States Supreme Court upheld the desegregation plan as ordered by the district court. All parties agreed that the school system failed to achieve the \"unitary\" school system required by the Equal Protection Clause. The district court stated that efforts should be made to reach a 71 percent White to 29 percent Black ratio in the schools, which reflected the system's student population. The final board plan left 10 schools 86 percent to 100 percent Black and yet categorically rejected the techniques of pairing and clustering. The Court held that where the proposed plan contemplated the continued existence of some schools that are all or predominately of one race, such schools should be scrutinized, and the school authorities had the burden of showing that such racial composition was not the result of present or past discriminatory practices. The plan adopted by the district court used zoning, pairing, and grouping techniques in the elementary schools so that schools throughout the system would be from nine percent to 38 percent Black. The Court upheld the district court's flexible use of mathematical ratios as a starting point rather than as an inflexible requirement. The district court's plan was reasonable, feasible, and workable, even though it required busing. </p><p>In addition to laying out a number of broad principles for ascertaining whether a school system has reached unitary status, the Court noted that the \"scope of permissible transportation of students as an implement of a remedial decree...cannot be defined with precision.\" In the case of CMS, it found that the district court's plan for transporting elementary school students to be reasonable, but left open the possibility that a transportation scheme could be invalidated if it posed a risk to health of children or the functioning of the educational process. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 402 U.S. 1 (1971). On June 7, the Supreme Court denied the Board's petition for a rehearing.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision, the Board submitted a new plan on June 17, 1971. It presented a revised feeder-school system for the 1971-72 term, but the Board withdrew it after Judge McMillan found several inadequacies. On June 29, 1971, the court suggested the Board either adjust their plan to result in more integration or continue using the Finger Plan. The student body ratio in each school was to be near 70 percent white and 30 percent black, with no school being predominantly black. Ultimately, the court decided to abandon the approved Finger plan and submit a modified feeder plan. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 328 F. Supp. 1346 (W.D.N.C. 1971). </p><p>On October 21, 1971, the original plaintiffs filed a motion for further relief, alleging the Board was not following through with its feeder plan. Judge McMillan denied the motion, but given that the Board was showing a willingness to allow re-segregation through its transfer policies, the case was kept open to ensure enforcement of the feeder plan as proposed. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 328 F. Supp. 1346 (W.D.N.C. 1971). </p><p>On June 19, 1973, Judge McMillan ordered the Board to refrain from using its feeder plan, which Judge McMillan considered to be likely to result in resegregation. For the 1973-74 school year, the court allowed for the existing plan to move forward, with several exceptions related to specific schools. The Board was ordered to submit a new plan by March 1, 1974. <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>, 362 F. Supp. 1223 (W.D.N.C. 1973). </p><p>On July 11, 1975, Judge McMillan ordered the Swann case closed and removed from the docket. He noted that the student assignment plan was satisfactory and praised the cooperation of a new Board, but added that CMS was required to comply with existing court orders and other legal requirements barring racial discrimination. </p><p>The issue of school desegregation in Charlotte-Mecklenburg was revived in the 1998 case <i>Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.</i>. The plaintiff there was the parent of a student who was denied admission to a magnet school because the CMS school board stated it was complying with race assignment requirements stemming from the desegregation order. On March 6, 1998, the district court granted the <i>Swann</i> plaintiffs' motions to (1) restore the case to the active docket and (2) consolidate <i>Swann</i> with <i>Capacchione</i>. The court simultaneously denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. 179 F.R.D. 177 (1998). </p><p>On September 9, 1999, the district court ruled that the school district had achieved unitary status with respect to the desegregation order. Thus, the court ruled it would dissolve the order. Further, the court found, with respect to Capacchione's particular claim that CMS instituted an unconstitutional admissions policy for its magnet schools, that the school district's inflexible ratio of Black to non-Black admitted students was an improperly tailored solution, like that in <i>Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke</i> (438 U.S. 265 (1978)). 57 F. Supp. 228 (1999). </p><p>Both the plaintiffs and the Board appealed.  On October 14, 1999, the Board filed a motion to stay and for additional relief. In its motion, the Board sought a limited stay, pursuant to Rule 62 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"of the effective date of the injunction in th[e] case until the beginning of the 2001-02 academic year.\" 190 F.R.D. 170. The plaintiffs also sought a full stay pending appeal. Both motions for stay were denied.</p><p>The Fourth Circuit, on November 30, 2000, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. Specifically, the appellate court found that unitary status had not been achieved with respect to student assignment, facilities, transportation, or student achievement. However, the court did find unitary status regarding faculty and extracurricular activities. Further, the court found that the lower court's finding of the school district's magnet school admissions policy as unconstitutional was incorrect because it was done in accordance with the existing injunctive desegregation order. 233 F.3d 232. </p><p>Following this decision, the Fourth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc. On January 17, 2001, the appellate court vacated its opinion. Thus, on September 21, 2001, the Fourth Circuit, after rehearing the case en banc, issued a per curiam opinion. The appellate court found that the school district did achieve unitary status, thus affirming the district court's decision to dissolve the injunctive desegregation order. The Fourth Circuit further affirmed the district court's finding that the school district's magnet school admissions policy was not narrowly tailored due to its rigid quotas. 269 F.3d 305 (2001). The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, but on April 15, 2002, the Supreme Court denied certiorari.</p><p>This case is now closed.</p><p>Available Opinions</p><p><i>Swann v.

      "text": "- - - - -\n159a \nSupplemental  Memorandum  dated  March  21,  1970 \nPursuallt.  t.o  the  order  of  the  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals,  filed  March  5,  1970,  t.his  memorandum  is  issued. \nPrevious  orders  cover  more  than  one  hundred  pages. \nThe  motions  and  exhibits  and  pleadings  and  evidence  num \nher  thousnnds  of  pages,  and  the  evidence  is  several  feet \nthicl\"  It.  may  be  useful  to  reviewing  authorities  to  have \na  brief  summary  of  the  case  in  addition  to  the  supple \nmental  facts  on  the  questions  of  transportation. \nBefore  1954,  the  schools  ill  Charlotte  and  Mecklenburg \nCounty  were  segrcgated  by  state  law.  The  General  As \nsembly,  in  response  to  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education, \nadopted  thc  Pupil  Assignment  Act  of  1955-56,  North  Caro \nlina  General  Statutes,  §1l5-176,  which  was  quoted  in  the \nApril  23,  1969  order  and  which  is  still  the  law  of  North \nCarolina.  It  provides  that  school  boards  have  full  and \nfinal  authority  to  assign  children  to  schools  a 11(1  that  no \nchild  can  be  enrol1cd  in  nor  attend  a  school  to  which  he \nhas  not  been  assigned. \nl;0 \n\"Freedom  of  choice\"  to  pick  a  school  has  never  been \nI t  \na  right  of  North  Carolina  public  school  students.  has \nbeen  a  courtesy  offered  in  recent  yeal's  by  some  school \nboards,  and  its  chief  effect  has  been  to  preserve  seJi,'Te \ngation. \nSlight  token  desegregation  of  the  schools  occurred  in \nthe  years  following  Brown.  The  Mecklenburg  County  and \nthe  Cl1arlotte  City  units  were  merged  in  1961. \nThis  suit  was  filed  in  1965,  and  an  order  was  entered \nin  1965  approving  the  school  board's  then  plan  for  de \nsegregation,  which  was  substantially  a  freedom  of  choice \n• \nplan  coupled  with  the  closing  of  some  all-black  schools. \nThere  was  no  further  court  action  until  1968,  when  a \nmotion  was  filed  requesting  further  desegregation.  Most \n\n160a \nSupplemental  Memorandwn  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nwhite students still attended \"white\" schools  and  most black \nstudents  still  attended  \"black\"  schools.  The  figures  on \nthis  subject  were  analyzed  in  this  court's  opinion  of \nApril  23,  1969  (300  F.Supp.  1358  (196!)),  in  which  the \nbackground  and  history  of  local  segregation  and  its  con \ntinuing  discriminatory  nature  were  analyzed  at  length. \nIn that order  the  ruled  that substantial  progress  had \nCOlll-t \nbeen  made  and  that many of  the  alleged acts  of discrimina \ntion  were  not  proved. \nHowever,  certain  significant  findings  and  conclusions \nwere  made  which  have  been  of  record  without  appeal  for \neleven  months.  These  include  the  following: \n1.  The  schools  were  found  to  be  unconstitutionally \nsegregated. \n2.  Freedom  of choice  had failed;  no  white  child  had \nchosen  to  attend  any  black  school,  and  freedom  of \nchoice  promoted  rather  than  reduced  segregation. \n3.  The  concentration  of  black  population  in  north \nwest  Charlotte  and  the  school  segregation  which  ac \ncompanied  it  were  primarily  the  result  of  discrimina \ntory  laws  and  governmental  practices  rather  than  of \nnatural  \"neighborhood\"  forces.  (This  finding  was  re \naffirmed  in  the  order  of  November  7,  1969.) \n4.  The  board  had  located  and  controlled  the  size \nand  population  of  schools  so  as  to  maintain  segrega \ntion. \n5.  The  plan  approved  and  put  into  effect  in  1965 \nhad  not  eliminated  unlawful  segregation. \n6.  The  defendants  operate  a  sizeable  fleet  of busses, \nserving over  23,000  children  at  an  average  annual  cost \n(to  state and local  governments  combined)  of  not more \nthan  $40  per  year  per  pupil. \n\n- - - - -\n161.a \nSupplemental  Memorandu.m  d.ated  March \n.21.,  1970 \n7.  Transportation  by  bus  is  a  legitimate  tool  for \nschool  boards  to  use  to  desegregate  schools. \n8.  Faculties  were  segregated,  and  be  de \n~honld \nsegregated.. \n9.  Und.er  v.  New  Kent  Gowdy  School  Board, \nGreet~ \n391  U.S.  430  (1968),  there  was  now  an  active  duty \nto  eliminate  segregation. \nThe  board  was  directed  to  submit  a  plan  to  desegre \ngate  the  schools. \nThe  order  produced  a  great  outcry  from  school  board \nmembers  and  others.  It also  produced  n  plan  which  called \nfor  the  closing of  Second  Wal'(l,  the  only  black  high  school \nlocated  near  a  white  neighborhood;  and  it  produced  no \nrezoning,  no  elimination  of  gerrymandering,  and.  only \nminor  changes  in  the  pupil  assignment  plan.  I t  did  pro \nduce  an  undertaking to desegreg'ate  the  faculties.  The  plan \nwas  reviewed  in  the  c01lrt  order of  June  20,  1969,  in  which \nthe  court  approved  the  provisioll  for  offering  transporta \ntion  to  children  transferring  from  majority  to  minority \nsituations  and  directed  the  preparation  of  a  plan  for  pupil \ndesegl'ega tion. \nThe  court  also  specifically  fonnd  that  gerrymandering \nhad  been  taking  place;  and  several  schools  were  cited  as \nillustrations  of  gerrymandering- to  promote  or  preserve \nsegregation. \nIn  June  of  1969,  pursuant  to  the  hue  and  cry  which \nhad  been  raised  about  \"bussillg,\"  :Mecklcnburg  representa \ntives  in  the  General  Assembly  of  North  ·Carolina  sought \nand  procured  passage  of  the  so-called  \"an ti-bussing\"  sta \nG.S. \ntute,  N.C.  115-176.1.

(1969, \nc.  1274.)\"  -\nThe  board's  next  plan  was  filed  July  29,  1969,  and  was \napproved  for  1969-70  by  the  order  of  August  15,  1969. \nThe  August  If)  order  contained  the  following  paragraph: \n\"The  most  obvious  and  constructive  clement  in  the \nplan  is  that  the  School  Board  has  reversed  its  field \nand  has  accepted  its  affirmative  constitutional  duty  to \ndesegreg'ate  pupils,  teachers,  principals  and staff mem \nbers  'at  the  earliest  possible  date.'  It  has  recognized \nthat  where  people  live  should  not  control  where  they \ngo  to  school  nor  the  quality  of  their  education,  and \nthat  transportation  may  be  necessary  to  comply  with \nthe  law.  I t  has  recognized  that  easy  methods  will  not \ndo  the  job; that rezoning of school lines, perhaps whole \nsale;  pairing,  grouping  or  clustering  of  schools  use \nj \nof computer  technology  and all  available  modern  busi-\n11ess  methods  can  and  must  be  considered  in  the  dis \ncharge  of  the  Board's  constitutional  duty.  This  cOllrt \ndoes  not  take  lightly  the  Board's  promises  and  the \nBoard's  undertaking  of  its  affirmative  duty  under  the \nConstitution  and  accepts  these  assurances  at  face \nvalue.  They  are,  in  fact,  the  conclusions  which  neces \nsarily  follow  when  any  group  of  women  and  men  of \ngood  faith  seriously  study  this  problem  with  knowl \nedge  of  the  facts  of  this  school  system  and  in  light  of \nthe  law  of the  land.\" \nThe  essential  action  of  the  board's  July  29,  1969  plan \nwas  to  close  seven  inner-city black  schools  and  to  re-assign \ntheir  pupils  to  designated  white  suburban  schools,  and  to \n• \n\n164a \nS11.ptJl.cmental  \"Ai emormldwn  do ted  JI arch  21)  1970 \ntransport  these  children  by  bus  to  these  burban  schools. \n8U \nIn  addition,  it  was  proposed  to  re-assign  1,245  students \nfrom  named black schools  to  named  suburban  white  schools \nand  provide  them  transportation. \nThe  total  of  this  one-way  transportation  of  black  stu \ndents  only  to  white  schools  under  this  plan  was  stated  to \nhe  4,245  children. \nNo  problem  of  transpo rtation  or  other  resources  was \nraised  or  suggested. \nThe  evidence  of  the  defendants  is  that  the  property \nvalue  of  the  schools  thus  closed  exceeds  $3,000,000.  For \nthe  most part,  that  property  sta11(1s  idle  today. \nThe  \"anti-bussing!!  law  was  not  found  by  the  board  to \ninterfere  with  this  proposed  wholesale  re-assigl1ment  and \n\"massive  bussing,\"  of  black  children  only,  for  pm·poses \nof  desegregation. \nThe  plan,  by  order  of  August  15,  1969,  was  approved \non  a  one-year  basis  only,  and  the  board  was  directed  to \nprepare and  file  by  November  17,  1969,  a  plan  for  complete \ndesegregation  of  all  schools,  to  the  maximum  extcnt  pos \nsible,  by  September  1,  1970. \nThe  defendants  filed  a  motion  asking  that  the  deadline \nto  prepare  a  plan  be  extended  fl·om  November  17,  1969, \nto  February  I,  1970.

The  result  was  the  pro \nchlCt.ion  of  two  plans  the  boarel  plan  and  the  plan  of  t.he \nconsultant,  Dr.  Finger. \nThe  detailed  work  both  final  plans  was  done  by  the \n011 \nschool  board  staff. \nThe  high  school  plan  prepared  by  the  hoard  ·was  recom· \nmended  hy  Dr.  Finger to  the  court with  one  minor  change . \n• \n\n170a \nSupplemental  Memornnd'l.Mn  dated  March  21,  1970 \nThis change  involved tmnsporting three hU11(lred  inner  city \nblack  children  to  Independence  High  School.  As  to  high \nschool  students,  then,  the  plan  which  was  ordered  by  the \nis \ncourt  to  take  effect  on  May  4,  1970  the  school  board's \nplan,  with transportation added for th,'ce  hundred students. \nThe  proportion of  black  children  in  the  high  schools  varies \nfrom  1770  to  36%  under  this  plan. \nFor  junior  high  schools,  separate  plans  were  prepared \nby  Dr.  Finger  and  by  the  board.  The  board  plan  would \nhave  used  zoning  to  desegregate  all  the  black  junior  high \nschools  except  Piedmont,  which  it  would  have  left  90% \nblack.  The  Finger  plan  employed  l'e-7.0ning  as  far  as  ap \npeared  feasible,  and  then  provided  for  transportation  be \ntween  inner  city  black  zones  and  outlying  white  schools  to \ndesegregate  all  the  schools,  including  Piedmont. \nThe court offered  the  school  board  the  options  of  (1)  re \nzoning,  or  (2)  closing  Piedmont,  or  (3)  two-way  transport \nof  students  between  Piedmont  and  other  schools.  or  (4) \naccepting  the  Finger  plan  which  descgregates  aU  junior \nhigh  schools. \nThe  board  met  and  elected  to  adopt  the  Finger  plan \nrather  than  close  Piedmont  or  rearrange  their  own  plan. \nThe  Finger  plan  may  require  the  transportation  of  more \nthan  the  board  plan  would  have  required,  hut  it \nstud~nts \nhandles  the  transportation  more  economically  and  effi \nciP.Jltl:-.r,  and  does  the  job  of  desegregating  the  junior  high \nschools.  The  percentage  of  black  students  in  the  junior \ngro \nhig-h  8('.hoo15  t.hus  constituted  will  vary  from  to  33%. \nThe  transportation  of  junior  high  students  called  for \nin  the  plan  thus adopted  by  tbe  board  pursuant to  the  eourt \norder  of  February  5,  1970,  is  essentially  the  same  sort \nthHt  was  ndopted  without  hesitation  for  4,245  black  chil \n(1I\"rn  when  t.he  seven  black  inner  city  :;;choo15  were  closen \nin  1969. \n\n171a \n• \nSu.pplemental  Memorandum  dated  March  21,  1970 \nFor elementary  schools  the  problem  is  more  complicated. \nDr.  Finger  prepared  several  plans  to  desegregate  the  ele \nmentary  schools  and  reviewed  them  with  the  school  staff. \nI t  \nwas  apparent  that  even  the  gerrymandering  considered \nthe \nby  the  board  could  not  desegregate  all  elementary \nis \nschools,  and  that  withont  transportation  there  no  way \nby  ,,-hich  in  the  immediate  future  the  continuing  effects  of \nstate  imposed  segregation  can  be  removed.  Dr.  Finger \nprepared  a  plan  which  proposed  re-zouing  of  as  many \nschools  as  could  be  desegregated  by  l'e-zoning  and  which \nthen  proposed  pfl i ring  or  grouping  of  schools.  By  pairi ng \nor  gronping,  a  black  school  and  one  more  white  schools \n01' \ncould  be  desegregated  by  having  gradCf;  one  through  four, \nbJack  and  white,  flttend  the  white  schools,  and  by  having \ngrades five  nnd  black  Hnd  white, attend  the  black school, \nsix~ \nand  by  providing  transportation  whore  to  accom \nneed.~d \nplish  this. \nThe  original  Finger  plan  proposed  to  group  hhlCk  i]lne1\" \neity  schools  with  white  schools  mostly  in  the  south  and \nsontheai'lt  perimeter  of  the  district. \nThe  school  staff  drafted  a  plan  which  went  as  far  as \nthey  could  go  with  re-zoning  and  stopped  there,  leaving \nhalf the  black elementarv children  in  black  schools  and  half \n-\nthe  white  elementary  chiliiren  in  white  schools. \nIn  other words,  hoth  the  plan  event.ually  proposed  by  the \nt.he \nschool  hoard  and  plan  proposed  by  Dr.  Finger  went \nflS  far  as  was  thought  practical  to  go  with  rc-zoning.  The \ndistinction  is  that  the Finger  plan  goes  ahead  and  does  the \njob  of desegregating  t.he  black  elementary  schools,  whereas \nthe  board  plan  stops  half  way  through  t.he  job. \nIn  its  original  Finger  pllln  elementary \nform  the  for \nwould  have  required  somewhat  less  t.ransport.ation \ns~hools \nthnn  it.s  final  form,  hut  would  have  been  more  rlifficnlt  to \n• \n\n172a \nSupplemental  IltJe-morandum  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nput  into  effect  rapidly.  The  pressure  of  time  imposed  by \ndecisions  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  other  appellate  cou rts \nhad  become  such  that  there  was  concern  lest  there  be  an \norder  from  one  of  the  appellate  courts  for  immediate \nFehruary or March desegregation of the entire system.  The \nschool  staff  therefore,  based  on  Finger's  guidelines,  pre \npared a  final  draft of his plan incorporating pairing, group \ning  and  transporti11g  on  a  basis  which  would  better  allow \nfor early imp1ementation  with  a  minimum of administrative \ncomplications,  in  lieu  of  his  original  plan. \nThe  result  is  that.  t.he  plan  for  elementary  schools  which \nis  known  as  the  \"Finger  plan\"  was  prepared  in  detail  by \nthe.  school  staff  and  incorporates  the  thought  and  work  of \nthe  staff  on  the  most  efficient  method  to  desegregate  the \nelementary  schools. \nThe  time  table  originally  adopted  by  this  court  in  April \nof  1969  was  one  calling  for  substantial  progress  in  1969 \nand  complete  desegregation  by  September  1970.  However, \non  October  29,  1969,  in  Alexander  v.

See generally Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public \nSchools: The Constitutional Concepts, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 564 (1965). But see, Deal v. Cincinnati Bd. of Ed., 419 F.2d 1387 (6th Cir. \n1969). \n \n4  The school board computed transportation requirements under the plan it submitted to be: \nThe board estimated that the breakdown of costs for the first year of operation under its plan would be: \nThe estimated total first-year costs are $864,700. \n \n5  These 300 students will be bussed a straight-line distance of some 10 miles. The actual bus routes will be somewhat longer, \ndepending upon the route chosen. A reasonable estimate of the bus route distance is 12 to 13 miles. The principal’s monthly bus \nreports for Independence High School for the month from January 10, 1970 to February 10, 1970 shows the average one-way \nlength of a bus route at Independence is presently 16.7 miles for the first trip. Buses that make two trips usually have a shorter \nsecond trip. The average one-way bus route, including both first and second trips, is 11.7 miles. Thus the distance the 300 pupils \nwill have to be bussed is nearly the same as the average one-way bus route of the students presently attending Independence, and it \n  15 \n \n\n \n \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 431 F.2d 138 (1970)   \n \nis substantially shorter than the system’s average one-way bus trip of 17 miles. \n \n6  Satellite school zones are non-contiguous geographical zones. Typically, areas in the black core of the city are coupled- but not \ngeographically linked- with an area in white suburbia. \n \n7  Title 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b) provides that as used in the subchapter on Public Education of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: \n“Desegregation’ means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color, \nreligion, or national origin, but ‘desegregation’ shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome \nracial imbalance.’ \nTitle 42 2000c-6(a)(2) states in part: \n‘Provided that nothing herein shall empower any official or court of the United States to issue any order seeking to achieve a racial \nbalance in any school by requiring the transportation of pupils or students from one school to another or one school district to \nanother in order to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court to insure compliance with \nconstitutional standards.’ \n \n8  The unconstitutional provisions are: \n‘No student shall be assigned or compelled to attend any school on account of race, creed, color or national origin, or for the \npurpose of creating a balance or ratio of race, religion or national origins. Involuntary bussing of students in contravention of this \narticle is prohibited, and public funds shall not be used for any such bussing.’ N.C.Gen.Stat. 115-176.1 (Supp.1969). \n \n9  The board’s plan provides: \n‘Any black student will be permitted to transfer only if the school to which he is originally assigned has more than 30 per cent of \nhis race and if the school he is requesting to attend has less than 30 per cent of his race and has available space. Any white student \nwill be permitted to transfer only if the school to which he is originally assigned has more than 70 per cent of his race and if the \nschool he is requesting to attend has less than 70 per cent of his race and has availabe space.’ \nThis clause, which was designed to prevent tipping or resegregation, would be suitable if all schools in the system were integrated. \nBut since the board envisions some elementary schools will remain nearly all black, it unduly restricts the schools to which pupils \nin these schools can transfer. It should be amended to allow these elementary pupils to transfer to any school in which their race is \na minority if space is available. \n \n1  In the entire system, 71% Of the pupils are white, 29% Of the pupils are black. The District Judge deemed a school havin 86% Or \ngreater white population identifiable as white, one with 56% Or greater black population identifiable as black. \n \n2  In its application to us for a stay pending appeal, counsel for the School Board relied heavily on Northcross v. Board of Education \nof Memphis, 420 F.2d 546 (6th Cir. 1970), as a judicial ruling that school assignments based on residence are constitutionally \nimmune. The defendant tendered us a statistical comparison of pupil enrollment by school with pupil population by attendance area \nfor the Memphis school system. \nSince then the Supreme Court in Northcross has ruled that the Court of Appeals erred insofar as it held that the Memphis board ‘is \nnot now operating a ‘dual school system’ * * *.’ 397 U.S. 232, 90 S.Ct. 891, 25 L.Ed.2d 246. \n \n3  A federal judge is not required to consult with the Department of Health, Edution and Welfare on legal issues. What is the \nconstitutional objective of a plan, and whether a unitary system has been or will be achieved, are questions for the court. HEW’s \ninterpretation of the constitutional command does not bind the courts. \nWhile administrative interpretation may lend a persuasive gloss to a statute, the definition of constitutional standards controlling \nthe actions of states and their subdivisions is peculiarly a judicial function. \nBowman v. County School Board of Charles City County, 382 F.2d 326 (4th 1967). \nAlthough the definition of goals is for the court, HEW may be able to provide technical assistance in overcoming the logistical \nimpediments to the desegregation of a school system. Thus it was quite understandable that at the outset of this case the District \nCourt invited the Board to consult with HEW. Desegregation of this large educational system was likely to be a complex and \nadministratively difficult task, in which the expertise of the federal agency might be of help. However, after a substantial period of \ntime and the beginning of a new school year, it became clear that the Board had no intention of devising a meaningful plan, much \nless seeking advice on how to do so. At that point (December 1969) with the need for speed in mind, the Judge appointed an expert \nalready familiar with the school system to work with the school staff in developing a plan. \nWhether to utilize the assistance of HEW is ordinarily up to the district judge. Consultation in formulating the mechanics of a plan \nis not obligatory. The method used by the Judge in this case was certainly sufficient. Moreover, now that a plan has been created \nand it appears that there are no real alternatives, a remand for HEW’s advice seems an exercise in futility. \n \n4  The only indication I have encountered that a serious traffic problem will be occasioned by the additional bussing is found in an \n  16 \n \n\n \n \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 431 F.2d 138 (1970)   \n \naffidavit by the City Director of Traffic Engineering. His statement is based on the exaggerated bus estimate prepared by the Board \nand rejected by the District Court. See note 5, infra. Moreover, he appears to have relied to a large extent on the erroneous \nassumption that under the plan busses would pick up and discharge passengers along busy thoroughfares, thus causing ‘stop-and-\ngo traffic of slow moving school busses in congested traffic.’ \nA later affidavit of the same official, filed at the request of the District Court, affords more substantial data. It reveals that the total \nestimated number of automobile trips per day in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County (not including internal truck trips) is 869,604. \nThat the 138 additional busses would gravely aggravate the congestion is dubious, to say the least. \n \n5  The District Judge rejected the Board’s inflated claims, and found that altogether the Finger plan would bus 13,300 new students in \n138 additional busses. The Board had estimated that 19,285 additional pupils would have to be transported, requiring 422 \nadditional busses. This estimate is disproportionate on its face, for presently 23,600 pupils are transported in 280 busses. As \nindicated above, the direct bus routes envisioned by the Finger plan should accomplish increased, not diminished, efficiency. The \ncourt  below,  after  close  analysis,  discounted  the  Board’s  estimate  for  other  reasons  as  well,  including  the  ‘very  short \nmeasurements’ used by the Board in determining who would have to be bussed, the failure of the Board to account for round-trips, \nstaggering of opening and closing hours, and overloads. \n \n6  The District Judge wrote in his December 1 order that \nFixed ratios of pupils in particular schools will not be set. If the board in one of its three tries had presented a plan for \ndesegregation, the court would have sought ways to approve variations in pupil ratios. In default of any such plan from the school \nboard, the court will start with the thought, originally advanced in the order of April 23, that efforts should be made to reach a 71-\n29 ratio in the various schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school is racially different from the others, but \nto understand that variations from that norm may be unavoidaable. \n \n7  For some extreme examples, see: School Board of Warren County v. Kilby, 259 F.2d 497 (4th Cir. 1958); Corbin v. County School \nBd.  of  Pulaski  County,  177  F.2d  924  (4th  Cir.  1949);  Griffith  v.  Bd.  of  Educ.  of  Yancey  County,  186  F.Supp.  511 \n(W.D.N.C.1960); Goins v. County School Bd. of Grayson County, 186 F.Supp. 753 (W.D.Va.1960), stay denied, 282 F.2d 343 \n(4th Cir. 1960). See also, Chambers v. Iredell Co., 423 F.2d 613 (4th Cir. 1970) (dissenting opinion). \n \n8  The majority calculates the elementary school portion of the plan to mean a 39% Increase in bussed pupils, 32% Increase in busses; \nthe whole package, it is said, would require a 56% Pupil increase and 49% Bus increase. \nThese figures are accurate but do not tell the whole story. If one includes within the number of students presently being transported \nthose that are bussed on commercial lines (5000) the increase in pupils transported would not appear to be as large. Thus the plan \nfor elementary schools would entail a 33% Bussed pupil increment, the whole Finger plan, 47%. \n \n9  Both in its characterization of the facts and in its treatment of the case the majority implies that the actions of this Board have been \nexemplary. I feel constrained to register my dissent from this view although on no account do I subscribe to the proposition that the \ndisposition of the case depends on this issue. \nOn April 23, 1969 the District Judge declared the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District illegally segregated. He found it \nunnecessary at that time to decide whether the Board had deliberately gerrymandered to perpetuate the dual system since he \nbelieved that the court order to follow would promote substantial changes. The Board was given until May 15 to devise a plan \neliminating faculty and student segregation. \nA majority of the Board voted not to take an immediate appeal and the school superintendent was directed to prepare a plan. His \nmandate was hazy. According to the court below- \nNo express guidelines were given the superintendent. However, the views of many members expressed at the meeting were so \nopposed to serious and substantial desegregation that everyone including the superintendent could reasonably have concluded, as \nthe court does, that a ‘minimal’ plan was what was called for, and that the ‘plan’ was essentially a prelude to anticipate disapproval \nand appeal. The staff were never directed to do any serious work on re-drawing of school zone lines, pairing of schools, combining \nzones, grouping of schools, conferences with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, nor any of the other possible \nmethods of making real progress towards desegregation. \nThe superintendent’s plan was submitted to the Board on May 8. It was quite modest in its undertaking. Nevertheless, the Board \n‘struck out virtually all the effective provisions of the superintendent’s plan.’ The plan ultimately filed by the Board on May 28 \nwas ‘the plan previously found racially discriminatory with the addition of one element- the provision of transportation for \n(majority to minority transfers.)’ The Board also added a rule making a student who transfers to a new high school ineligible for \nathletics for a year. As the District Judge found, \nthe effect of the athletic penalty is obvious- it discriminates against black students who may want to transfer and take part in sports, \nand is no penalty on white students who show no desire for such transfers. \nIn the meantime the Board for the first time refused to accept a recommendation of the superintendent for the promotion of a \nteacher to principal. The reason avowed was that the teacher, who was black and a plaintiff in the suit, had publicly expressed his \n  17 \n \n\n \n \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 431 F.2d 138 (1970)   \n \nagreement with the District Court order. The job was withheld until the prospective appointee signed a ‘loyalty oath.’ \nThe District Judge held a hearing on June 16 and ruled on June 20. He declined to find the Board in contempt but did note that ‘the \nboard does not admit nor claim that it has any positive duty to promote desegregation.’ The Judge also returned to the issue of \ngerrymandering and found ‘a long standing policy of control over the makeup of school population which scarcely fits any true \n‘neighborhood school philosophy.“ \nOn July 29, the Board returned with a new plan. The District Judge was pleased to learn that ‘the School Board has reversed its \nfield and has accepted its affirmative constitutional duty to desegregate pupils, teachers, principals and staff members ‘at the \nearliest possible date.“ In view of this declaration and of the late date, the court ‘reluctantly’ approved for one year only a plan \nwhereby seven all black inner-city schools would be closed and a total of 4245 black children bussed to outlying white schools. \nThe Board was directed to file a plan for complete desegregation in November. \nBy November, the District Judge was able to survey the results achieved under the plan adopted for the year. He found that ‘only \n1315 instead of the promised 4245 black pupils’ had been transferred. (Later information revealed that the number was only 767.) \nFurthermore, he found that \nThe Board has indicated that its members do not accept the duty to desegregate the schools at any ascertainable time; and they have \nclearly indicated that they intend not to do it effective in the fall of 1970. They have also demonstrated a yawning gap between \npredictions and performance. \nOn November 17, the Board filed a plan. It ‘discarded further consideration of pairing, grouping, clustering and transporting.’ \nOstensibly ‘to avoid ‘tipping,“ the plan provided that white students would not be assigned to schools where they would find \nthemselves with less than 60% Whites. This was, as the District Court found, a one-way street in view of the fact that the plan \ncontemplated no effort to desegregate schools with greater than 40% Blacks. The plan also dropped the earlier provision of \ntransportation for students transferring out of segregated situations. Thus the Board nullified the one improvement it had made in \nits May 8 plan. It also left those black students who had transferred to outlying schools pursuant to the July 29 plan without \ntransportation. Understandably, the court labeled this ‘re-segregation.’ \nIn the face of this total lack of cooperation on the part of the Board, the court was compelled to appoint an expert to devise a plan \nfor desegregation. The Finger plan was the result. \nIt appears from the record that on most issues the Board was sharply divided. Of course I mean to cast no aspersions on those \nmembers- and there were some- who urged the Board forthrightly to shoulder its duty. But the above recital of events demonstrates \nbeyond doubt that this Board, through a majority of its members, far from making ‘every reasonable effort’ to fulfill its \nconstitutional obligation, has resisted and delayed desegregation at every turn. \n \n1  On remand the District Court in Northcross has held there was no Constitutional obligation to transport pupils to overcome a racial \nimbalance. Northcross v. Board of Education of the Memphis City Schools, 312 F.Supp. 1150 (W.D.Tenn., May 1, 1970) (per \nMcRae, J.). In the same Circuit, see, too, Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 419 F.2d 1387 (6 Cir. 1969). \n \n1  Certainly, if the district court’s order with respect to high schools and junior high schools is affirmed, the district court should not \nbe invited to reconsider its order with respect to them.

The History ofthe Swann Litigation \nGiven the fact the Swann case was a closed file for over twentY two (22) years \nbefore  being  reactivated  by  this  Court,  some  historical  background  would  seem \nhelpful.  The  Swann  litigation  was  initiated  on  January  19,  1965.  As  a remedy, \nPlaintiffs asked the Court to end de jure segregation of the public school system \nadministered by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Board of Education (CMS) for \nthe City of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County.  CMS is now the 25th \nlargest school district in the nation, with more than 150 schools.  \"The area is large -\n550 square miles - spanning roughly 22 miles east-west and 36 miles north-south.\" \nSwann v.  Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Edue., 402 U.S.  1,6,91 S.Ct.  1267, 1271 \n(1971 ). \nThe District Court ordered CMS to end de jure segregation and to present a plan \nthat would effectively desegregate the public school system. The District Court cited \nBrown v. Bd. of Ed., 347 U.S. 483 (1954) and 349 U.S. 294 (1955) (Brown II) as its \nauthority. Therein, the Supreme Court held that \"the transition to a unitary nonracial \n2 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 2 of 55\n\nsystem of public education was and is the ultimate end to be brought about\" by a \ndesegregation order.  377 U.S. at 234 (emphasis added). \nI \nIn discussing desegregation and unitary status, it is prudent to first define our \nterms.  This Court has said \"that the word 'dual' in the Supreme Court opinion is \nanother word for 'segregated', and that unitary is another word for 'desegregated' or \n'integrated'.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 306 F.Supp. 1299, \n1301 (W.D.N.C. 1969).  Since a unitary school  system is a legally desegregated school \nsystem, Section 2000c(b) ofTitie IV of the Civil Rights Act defines \"desegregation\" \nthusly: \n'Desegregation' means the assigrunent of students to public schools and within \nsuch schools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin, but \n'desegregation' shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in \norder to overcome racial imbalance. \nThe problem that instigated this litigation is the refusal by CMS to adopt a race neutral \n1 \nstudent assignment plan, despite the fact the school district has now been legally desegregated for \ndecades.  The  current  race-based  remedial  desegregation  plan  adopted  decades  ago  has \nmetamorphasized into an institution the Board simply will not voluntarily relinquish. In the words \nof the  Fourth Circuit, allegedly remedial  preferences, \"may remain in  effect only so  long as \nnecessary to remedy the discrimination at which they are aimed; they may not take on a life of their \nown.\"  Maryland Troopers Assoc., Inc. v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1076 (4th  Cir.  1993) (Potter, 1. \njoining) \n3 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 3 of 55\n\nThe Supreme Court has defined the aim of desegregation as: \"to correct, by a balancing \nof individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution.\" \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 15-16. \nIn 1969, CMS had 57 schools that were racially identifiable as white, 25 racially \nidentifiable Black schools.  CMS also had 24 schools that were considered racially \nbalanced.  Swann v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 306 F.Supp.  1299,  1303 \n(W.D.N.C. 1969).  In acknowledging the difficulties faced by CMS in devising and \nimplementing an effective desegregation plan, the Swann court observed that Charlotte \nhas always \"had a very high degree of segregation of housing.\"  Swann v. Charlotte \nMecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 300 F.Supp. 1358,1365 (W.D.N.C. 1969). \nTo  assist the  school  system  in overcoming these kinds of demographic barriers to \ndesegregation, the District Court approved a Majority to Minority Transfer Program \n(M to M),  and closed seven (7) formerly Black schools which forced the transfer of \n2 \nover  3,000  black  students  to  predominantly  white  suburban  schools.  Swann  v. \nCharlotte Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 306 F.Supp. 1291 (W.D.N.C. 1969).3 \nIt simultaneously facilitated M to M transfers by Black high school students by invalidating \n2 \nthe rule that penalized athletes one year of eligibility upon transfer, due to the racially discriminatory \neffects of such a rule. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,  300 F.Supp. 1381 (W.D.N.C. \n1969). \nJThe District Court also approved a faculty desegregation plan in this Order. \n4 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 4 of 55\n\nIn  1969,  the District Court specifically found  there were no  vestiges of the \nsegregated dual school system, and thus no ongoing racial discrimination or inequality, \nin the following areas of operation: \n1.  Use offederal funds for special aid to the disadvantaged; \n2.  The qualitY of the facilities, including school buildings, and equipment, \nand in the use of mobile classrooms; \n4 \n3.  Extracurricular activities: in response to the only objection made by the \nSwann Plaintiffs in this regard which was that coaches at predominantly \nblack schools were predominantly black, and vice versa, the Court found \n\"no pattern of discrimination appears in the coaching ranks\"; \n4.  Parent Teacher Association contributions and activities; \n5.  School fees; \n6.  School lunches; \n7.  Library books and facilities; \n8.  Curriculum and availability of elective courses; \n9.  Individual evaluation of students and assignment of students in advanced \nplacement and achievement based class assignments; and \n, In 1971, this Court again stated \"the fonnerly black schools are not shown nor suggested \nto be inferior in faculty, plant, equipment or program .... \" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board \nof Education, 334 F. Supp. 623, 625 (W.O.N.C. 1971). \n5 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 5 of 55\n\n10.  Racial  gerrymandering  of school  attendance  zones  to  exclude  black \ns \nstudents.\nSee Swann, 300 F.Supp. 1358,  1366-67 (WD.N.C.  1969).6  The court in 1969 also \napproved the Board's actions to desegregate its faculties, noting that the \"goal\" for \ndesegregation of faculties was to \"approach a ratio under which all schools in the \nsystem will have approximately the same proportion of black and white teachers.\" \nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1295. \nOn  February  5,  1970,  the  District  Court  approved  a  Court  consultant's \ndesegregation  plan  for  elementary  schools  known  as  the  \"Finger  Plan\"  for  the \nelementary schools.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F.Supp. 265 \n(WD.N.C.  1970).  Cross appeals were filed.  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \naffinned the District Court Order in all major respects.  It vacated only that part of the \n'Finger Plan' that required the pairing of predominantly white and black elementary \nschools to exchange students on a wholesale basis as a means of desegregation. Swann \nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 431 F.2d 138 (4th Cir. 1970). \nSIn fact, the opposite has now come to pass with oddly shaped attendance zones -even the \nuse of non-contiguous satellite zones -being used to achieve a predetemlincd racial mix of students \nin system schools. \n'In a later Order, the Court continued to  rely upon these early findings,  stating; \"The \ndefendants contended and the court found in its April 23, 1969 order that facilities and teachers in \nthe various black schools were not measurably inferior to those in the various white schools.  It is \ntoo late now to expect the court to proceed upon an opposite assumption.\"  Swann, 306 F. Supp. at \n1298 (emphasis added). \n6 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 6 of 55\n\nA. The Supreme Court Opinion in Swann: \nThe Supreme Court reinstated the District Court order, see Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education, 399 U.S. 926, 90 S.Ct. 2247 (1970), and expanded \non their rationale for reinstatement in an opinion published at 402 U.S.-I, 91 S.Ct. 1267 \n(1971).  The District Court entered an order after the first Supreme Court opinion in \n7 \nSwann on August 3, 1970 and clarified its prior order approving the Finger Plan by \nstating it was not requiring a specific racial  balancing of the student bodies; that its \n\"purpose is not [to require] some fictitious 'mix. '\"  Swann, 318 F .Supp. 786, 792. \nThe  Finger Plan called for deployment of several  aggressive desegregation \ntechniques  non-contiguous satellite zones; pairing of elementary schools).  The \n(~, \nplan created nine (9) noncontiguous satellite attendance zones.  Incredibly, despite \n8 \ngoing to a more \"voluntary\" student assignment plan (SAP) in the 1990s, eMS now \nincorporates over 60 such satellite zones into its current SAP. The plan projected the \nthe pairing of elementary schools would increase Black enrollment to a low of9% and \na high of38% Black students in elementary schools. Id.  In fact, the practice of pairing \ncontinued for over 20 years and far exceeded these goals before finally being replaced \n'When the Supreme Court entered its order, CMS had more than 84,000 students housed in \n107 schools,  Approximately 24,000 students  (29%) were Black; some 14,000 Black students \nattended 21 schools that were 99% Black.  Swann, 402 U,S. at 6-7. \n'Swann, 402 U.S. at 9. \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 7 of 55\n\nduring the first part of this decade by Magnet Schools that used even stricter racial \nquotas to insure \"racially balanced\" schools. \nThe Supreme  Court specifically noted at the outset of its opinion approving the \nFinger Plan, the district court warning regarding the inability of the plan to meet any \nmathematical goal or quota for racial balance within a particular school's student body: \nFixed [racial] ratios ofpupils ... will not be set.. .. [T]he Court will start with the \nthought  that  efforts  should  be  made  to  reach  a  [certain] ... ratio ... but,  to \nunderstand that variations from that norm may be unavoidable. \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 9 n.4 (emphasis added). \nIn this case, CMS takes the unprecedented position that this Court should deny \nit unitary status based on the very standard the District Court acknowledged to  be \nunreachable.  Largely  for  political  reasons  and  contrary to  current  Supreme  Court \nopinions,  CMS  contends  it  cannot  be  declare  unitary  until  all  of its  schools  are \nindefinitely  maintained  within  the  confines  of preset  mathematical  racial  goals, \nregardless of their location or the residential racial demographics of the community the \nschool serves. The Swann Court rejected this myopic view of desegregation law over \n28 years ago: \nIf we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a matter of \nsubstantive  constitutional  right,  any  particular  degree  of racial  balance  or \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 8 of 55\n\nmixing, that approach would be disapproved .... The constitutional command to \ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must \nalways reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole. \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 24. (emphasis added). \nCMS  contends the fact a few schools currently have percentages of African \nAmerican students which exceed the variance permitted in the court order is evidence \nof a \"vestige\" of the former segregated dual school system. The Supreme Court, even \nin  1971, recognized that the existence of such schools do  not necessarily indicate \n\"present or past discriminatory action.\" Swann, 402  V.S.  at 26.  In fact,  the Court \nanticipated and rejected that contention by acknowledging that predominantly one race \nschools, despite the use of all constitutional efforts to desegregate, were inevitable: \nThe record in this case reveals the familiar phenomenon that in metropolitan \nareas  minority  groups  are  often  found  concentrated  in  one  part  of  the \ncity ... [C]ertain schools may remain all or largely of one race until new schools \ncan be provided or neighborhood patterns change .... [T]he existence of some \nsmall number of one-race schools within district is not in and of itselfthe mark \nof a system that still practices segregation by law. \nSwann, 402 V.S. at 25-26. \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 9 of 55\n\nCMS justifies its racially gerrymandered attendance zones by contending they \nwere legally required to avoid a decline in the system's \"racial balance.\"  However, the \nSupreme Court did not authorize the use of racially gerrymandered and noncontiguous \nsatellite attendance zones on a long term basis. \"As an interim corrective measure, \n1 \n[satellite and racially gerrymandered attendance zones  cannot be said to be beyond the \n... remedial powers of a court.\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 27. Although 'administratively \nawkward\" \"inconvenient\" and \"bizarre\" measures could be permitted in 1971 to attain \nracial balance, the clear context of that pern1ission was where unavoidable \"in the \ninterim period.\" rd. At 28 (emphasis added).  In spite of this clear limitation, and nearly \nthirty  years  after  racial  balance  had  been  attained  and  maintained,  CMS  has \ngeometrically  increased  its  reliance  on  satellite  zones,  quotas  and  racial \ngerrymandering to maintain an artificial level of racial balance in its  schools. \nThe Supreme Court made clear in Swann that, absent a continuing failure by \nCMS  to  deliver  equal  educational  opportunity  to  Negro  students  due  to  the \ndemonstrated  presence and impact of vestiges of the former dual system, \"there would \nbe no basis for judicially ordering assignment of students on a racial basis.  \"All things \nbeing equal, with no history of discrimination,  it might well be desirable to assign \nstudents to schools nearest their homes.\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 27-28. The Swann Court \nwisely predicted that changing residential patterns and community demographics will \n10 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 10 of 55\n\nimpact, sometimes adversely, the degree of integration a desegregation plan will be \nable to maintain over time in a school system.  Recognizing that such changes were \nusually  caused  by  non-governmental  action,  the  Swann  Court  made  clear  the \nconsequences of such private action could not be the basis for any further race-based \nremedial measures required of a school system: \nIt does not follow that the communities served by such systems will remain \ndemographically  stable,  for  in  a growing,  mobile  society,  few  will  do  so. \nNeither school  authorities  nor district courts are  constitutionally required to \nmake year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once \nthe  affirmative  duty  to  desegregate  has  been  accomplished  and  racial \ndiscrimination through official action is eliminated from the system.  This does \nnot mean that federal courts are without power to deal with future problems; but \nin the absence of a showing that either the school authorities or some other \nagency  of the  State  has  deliberately  attempted  to  fix  or  alter  demographic \npatterns to affect the racial composition of the schools, further intervention by \na district court should not be necessary. \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 31-32. (emphasis added). \nB. District Court Implementation of 'Swann' \n11 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 11 of 55\n\nCMS deployed the \"Finger Plan\" which eliminated majority black schools \"as \nnearly as practicable\" by actively implementing the many desegregation techniques \nincorporated into the plan. Eschewing the leeway it was specifically provided by the \nSupreme COUli in Swann, CMS has wrongfully incorporated racial quotas into its SAP. \nFrom 1969 forward to 1989, more than 90% ofCMS schools complied with the court \norders,  even  using  the  stringent racial  quotas  CMS  relies  on  for  its  definition of \nintegration. See Evaluation of Unitary Status in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Report to the \nCourt by Dr. David 1. Armor (Armor Report) Table 1. \nThe Armor Report further established that CMS schools measure up quite well \nwhen compared to other unitary school systems having similar characteristics using \ncommonly accepted indices of desegregation.  The exposure index (measures how \nmuch students of one race come in contact with students of another race) has remained \nquite high since 1972.  The imbalance index, while showing a small increase over time, \nhas also continued to remain below a value of 30, or \"substantially desegregated\" for \nnearly thirty years.  Id., Charts 4, 5, 6.  CMS schools have remained largely in racial \nbalance to date, despite major demographic changes. Over 83% of all schools presently \nmeet the precise mathematical definition developed back in 1969 as an interim remedy \nto combat the then pervasive effects of de jure segregation. See Armor Report, Chart \n1. These figures, particularly considering the fact they have been maintained over such \n12 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 12 of 55\n\na long period of time, indicate both the long term and successful commitment of CMS \nto desegregation; they also constitute irrefutable evidence that CMS schools have been \nlegally desegregated under present Supreme Court standards for decades. \nOur review of the long history ofthis case has established that no desegregation \norder established any minimum black student population for any school.  Originally, \nthis Court ordered \"[t]hat no school be operated with an all black or predominately \nblack  student  body.\"  Swann  v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of Education,  311 \nF.Supp. 265, 268 (W.D.N.C. 1970).  In fact, this Court specifically rejected the Swann \nPlaintiffs'  claim that \"since the ratio of white to  black students is about 70/30, the \nSchool Board should assign the children on a 70% white and 30% black, and bus them \nto all the schools.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 300 F.Supp. \n1358,  1371  (WD.N.C.  1970).  Instead, this Court stated it \"does not feel  it has the \npower to make such a specific order.\"  Id.  Ultimately, this Court only ordered that, \"no \nelementary school except Hidden Valley shall be operated with a black student body \nexeeeding the K-6 system-wide ratio plus  15%.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard of Education, (WD.N.C. Unpublished Order April 17, 1980). \nAs to secondary schools, this Court ordered that CMS must not operatc such \nschools \"with a predominately black student body.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBoard  of Education,  328  F.Supp.  1346,  1349  (W.D.N.C.  1971).  No  court order \n13 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 13 of 55\n\nprohibits schools that are predominately white in their student population.  Indeed, in \n1973,  Judge  McMillan  approved  a plan  which  allowed  Matthews  Elementary  to \nmaintain a student body with only a 10% black population.  Swann v. Mecklenburg \nCounty Board of Education, 311 F.Supp. 265, 268 (W.D.N.C. 1970), see also, id., 362 \nF.Supp. 1223, 1228 (W.D.N.C. 1973). \nThis obviously refleets the District Court's ongoing awareness  of the racial \ndemography  and  geography  of  this  very  large  district,  which  contains  large \nconcentrations of predominately white population in suburban areas located far from \nthe  black  population  centers  closer  to  the  inner  city  of Charlotte.  Residential \ndemographics  made  any  minimum  minority  student  quota  impracticable,  if not \nimpossible, to implement, given the great distances buses would have to travel, the \ntraffic patterns that make movement of any large number of suburban kids to the inner \ncity during the morning rush hour an impossibility, and demographic growth patterns. \nSee Report to the Court of William A.V. Clark, Demographic Change in Charlotte \nMeeklenburg, (hereinafter \"Clark Report\"). \nIn 1974, the Board developed its own SAP with community input.  The District \nCourt accepted this remedial plan in 1974 and incorporated its prior orders.  Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  Schools  Board  of  Education,  379  F.Supp.  1102,  1105 \n(WD.N.C. 1974).  This plan achieved high levels of integration in all sehools.  A year \n14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 14 of 55\n\nlater, the 1974 Plan having been implemented in good faith, the District Court deemed \nfurther court supervision unnecessary.  Swann, 67 F.RD. 648 (W.D.N.C.  1975).  In \nclosing the case, the District Court reminded all parties, by citation to its original 1969 \nOrder,  that desegregation does  not depend  on any  particular racial  balance in the \nschools:  \"The duty to desegregate schools does not depend upon ...  any particular \nracial proportion of students.\"  Swann, 67 F.R.D. at 650; see also Swann, 318 F.Supp. \nat 794.  The Court confidently concluded that it did not anticipate CMS would ever \nreturn to a dual school system given how \"exhaustively (and expensively)\" all issues \nhad been litigated, removed the case from the active docket, and ordered the case file \nbe closed.  Swann, 67 F.R.D. at  650. \nUnfortunately, the District Court Judge's conviction that the case was at an end \nwas proven wrong by CMS.  Despite the notable success of CMS's desegregation \nefforts for thirty years, its Board has chosen to do the unthinkable -. to demand that \ncourt supervision continue into the next millennium. CMS asks this Court to sanction \nindefinite racial balancing of its schools via involuntary student assignments, race \nbased bussing and rigid racial quotas.  Its racial balance goals no longer parallel any \nconstitutional obligation to desegregate, but are driven by the political objective of a \nmajority of CMS Board members to elevate racial \"diversity\" within the schools to a \nmandate rather than  an  aspiration the  courts  have  held  it  must  be  constitutionally \n15 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 15 of 55\n\nlimited to.  CMS' Board has adopted this course of action using this Court's orders as \nboth a sword and a shield in a manner which was never envisioned by the supervising \ncourt. \nThe  case  has  remained  largely  inactive  since  1975.  In  1980,  due  to  the \nincreasing minority enrollment in the district,  CMS  requested the District Court \n9 \npermit CMS to relax the racial \"boundary line\" used in the 1975 Order by allowing the \nblack  population of elementary schools a fifteen  (15%) percent variance from  the \ndistrict wide racial composition of elementary school students as the benchmark by \nwhich the elementary SAP would be judged. Again, no floor was established for the \npercentage  of black  students  that  must  attend  a  school  and  no  prohibition  of \npredominately white schools was ordered.  See Swann Order dated April  12, 1980. \nThere is no explanation in the Order as to why CMS did not seek the variance for \nmiddle and high school students. \nSince then, substantial demographic changes have continued to occur in the \nCounty, driven by a massive influx of new residents during the  1980s-1990s. This \nsuburban  growth  made  even  the  relaxed  elementary  school  standard  difficult  to \nThe district is now made up of 40% African-American and 10% other minority students, \n9 \nIn significant contrast to the demographics of the district in  1969: 71 % white and 29% black. \nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1297. \n16 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 16 of 55\n\nmaintain in outlying areas.  This led to a substantial increase in the use of satellite \nzones.  Clark Report. \nIn  1998, this Court reactivated Swann, consolidated it with the Capacchione \nlitigation,  and  permitted  the  Grant  intervention  for  the  purpose -of resolving  all \nremaining issues regarding the unitary status of the Defendant CMS. \nII. The Capacchione Claim \nCapacchione ftled his complaint challenging the CMS SAP for magnet schools, \nwhich employ separate racial lotteries to select the students that are to be enrolled in \neach program.  Capacchione contends the racial component of the magnet SAP caused \nhis daughter Cristina to be denied admission to a magnet school. Capacchione seeks \na declaration that the use of a racially segregated lottery to achieve a specific racial \ncomposition  for  each  magnet  school  student  body  is  unconstitutional  because  it \nexcludes students from magnet school programs on the basis of race.  Capacchione \n10 \nalso seeks monetary damages and compensation for all reasonable attorneys' fees and \nexpenses of litigation incurred in the litigation. \nIII. The Grant Intervenors' Claims \nFor example, if students of a particular race failed to apply or participate in the racially \n10 \nseparate lottery, those unfilled seats were generally left open to insure the magnet school came as \nclose to the system wide 60/40 white/black racial goal for enrollment as the applicant pool would \npermit. \n17 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 17 of 55\n\nThe Grant Intervenors are parents of children eligible to attend public schools \nin Mecklenburg County.  Parents have an intense interest in the education of their \nchildren. \nGrant Intervenors have also objected to the race-based admis-sion policies for \ndistrict magnet schools.  In addition, they have challenged the other race-based student \nassignment techniques employed by CMS, including satellite zones, midpoint schools \nand other racially gerrymandered attendance zones they contend are predominantly \nbased  on  race,  and  designed  to  achieve  a predetermined  racial  composition  in  a \nschool's student body. \nIn response to CMS's contention that  it is merely enforcing the Swann court's \ndefinition  of racial  balance,  the Grant Interveners contend CMS  has  ignored the \nlimitations  on  race-based  student assignments  contained  in  these  Orders,  and  has \ntransfoffi1ed what was intended to be an interim remedial plan designed to eliminate \nany  remaining  vestiges of the  former  dual  system of segregated  education into  a \npermanent  race-based  student  assignment  plan.  This  plan  no  longer  has  the \nremediation of constitutional deficiency as  its goal but has become an end in itself. \nGrant  Intervenors  argue  that the  effect of CMS  continuing  to  employ  race-based \nstudent  assignment  techniques  in  a  de  facto  desegregated  system  is  to \nunconstitutionally subordinate important considerations such as school proximity and \n18 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 18 of 55\n\nthe  reduction  of bussing  and  involuntary  student  assignments,  to  the  district's \npolitically  motivated  (and  impossible)  efforts  to  overcome  the  geographic  and \ndemographic realities of Mecklenburg County through by the brute force of a vast \nmandatory bussing and quota plan.  Such emphasis on the minutiae of numbers rather \nthan overall educational goals compromises equal educational opportunity for all CMS \nstudents. \nIV. ISSUES FOR TRIAL \nThe threshold issue before this Court is whether CMS has, after thirty years of \ngood faith implementation of a desegregation order, attained unitary status in student \nassignment or any other of the Green factors.  The most important of these factors is \nstudent assignment, because it was the discriminatory assignment of students which \nwas the hallmark and purpose of a segregated school system.  See  Swann, 402 U.S. \nat 6,  17 and 23.11 \nOur objective in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see \nthat school authorities exclude no pupil of a racial minority from any \nsehool, directly or indireetly, on account of race .... \n12 \n\"\"Desegregation means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools \nwithout regard to race ....\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 17. \n12The Court went on to note that school integration \"does not and cannot embrace all the \nproblems of racial  prejudice, even  when  those problems  contribute to  disproportionate  racial \nconcentrations in some schools.\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 23. \n19 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 19 of 55\n\nSwann,  402  U.S.  at 23.  The other Green factors  represent important indicia of a \nsegregated system, independent of student assignment.  rd. at 18. \nAt the outset of the Capacchione litigation, this Court inquired of CMS whether \nit was a unitary school system.  After due consideration and consultation with counsel, \nCMS dismayed us all by its response of \"No.\"  Instead, CMS elects to defend the case \nby contending thirty years was not enough time for the school system to attain unitary \nstatus.  The  intervention of the Grant  Plaintiffs has  provided  the  catalyst for  an \nexpanded review and evaluation of cvery aspect of the school system's desegregation \nefforts. Three decades have passed since CMS operated de jure segregated schools. The \nfact almost all CMS schools have been highly racially balanced for 29 years is ample \nevidence  that  any  current  imbalances  are  not  attributable  to  vestiges  of de  jure \nscgregation.  As such, CMS  is  entitled to unitary status with respect to its student \nassignment practices. See  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 112 S.Ct.  1430 (1992).  It \nis clear now that a court may order incremental withdrawal of its supervision in a \nschool desegregation case, declaring a school system unitary in one area before it has \nachieved full compliance in all areas.  rd. at 490-91. \nCappachione and Grant also contend that CMS has attained unitary status with \nrespect to  other Green factors.  First, the district Court in  Swann found  numerous \npotential issues, including facilities and extracurricular activities, were not attributable \n20 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 20 of 55\n\nto racial discrimination by CMS.  Swann, 300 F.Supp. at 1366-67.  Sccond, this Court \nfound CMS did not discriminatorily \"track\" black students into lower level classes and \nthat the fact that \"[fJew black students are in the advanced sections and most are in \nregular or slow sections\" was not based on their race but rather \"on-the achievement \nof a particular student in a particular subject.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board \nof Education,  300  F.Supp.  1358,  1367  (W.D.N.C.  1969).  These  findings  are  res \njudicata. Riddick, 784 F.2d at 531-32 (\"The principles of collateral estoppel or issue \npreclusion are applicable to school desegregation cases.\").  Thus, any party claiming \nthat CMS facilities, the under-representation of black students in advanced courses, and \nextracurricular  activities  are  discriminatory  should  have  the  burden  of proof to \nestablish a new constitutional violation.  See Riddick, 784 F.2d at 538.  Additionally, \nCMS has been engaged in good faith desegregation efforts with respect  to the other \nGreen factors as well for many years.  Examination of the evidence will show that \nCMS has, through good faith efforts over the past thirty years, eliminated vestiges to \nthe extent practicable in the areas of faculty and staff assignment, transportation and \nquality of education, so as to entitle CMS to unitary status in toto.  In the event that this \nCourt disagrees, this Court must examine whether removal of the race-based student \nassignment plan will so adversely impact areas in which the Court finds vestiges of the \ndual  school  system  remain  that  retention  of control  over  student  assignment  is \n21 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 21 of 55\n\nnecessary to insure CMS's eventual compliance in that other area.  See  Freeman v. \nPitts, 503 U.S. at 497-98.  However, it is to be noted in this regard that: \nfederal court decrees must directly address and relate to the constitutional \nviolation itself.  Because  of this inherent limitation upon  federal judicial \nauthority,  federal  court  decrees  exceed  appropriate  limits  if they  are \naimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or \ndoes not flow from such a violation. \nMilliken v. Bradley, (Milliken II), 433 U.S. 267, 282 (1977); accord, Board of Educ. \nV. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 247 (1991). \nFinally, Cappachione and the Grant Intervenors allege racial discrimination in \nthe manner in which CMS has assigned them to (or prevented them from attending) \nparticular CMS schools.  Thcse claims arise from the racial classification to which the \nstudents were SUbjected due to the CMS SAP. Cappachione and Grant contend that \nCMS has been de facto unitary for years.  As such, there is no legitimate remedial need \nor basis for racial classification of students in CMS.  CMS, having become de facto \nunitary in student assignment, cannot indefinitely defer a declaration of unitary status \nin  an  attempt  to justifY the  institutionalization  of  race-based  student  assignment \npolicies. Ifno remedial purpose is served by the racial nature of the SAP, then CMS \n22 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 22 of 55\n\nis subject to the requirements of strict scrutiny as is any governmental actor.  CMS's \nstudent assignment plan cannot meet this strict standard. \nThe overarching legal issues for resolution by the Court are as follows: \n1. Unitary Status: \n(A) Whether CMS  is unitary with respect to student assignment? This \nquestion  requires  an  examination  of whether  CMS  either  is  engaged  in  current \nintentional discrimination against African-American students in the area of student \nassignment or currently retains vestiges of the prior de jure system of segregation in \nstudent assignment which have not been remedied to the extent praetieable over the \nthirty-plus years of this litigation. \n(B)  Whether CMS  is  unitary with respect to any other Green factors, \nincluding  transportation, facilities, extracun'icular activities, faculty assignment, and \nstaff assignment?  This requires an examination of whether CMS either is engaged in \ncurrent  intentional  discrimination  against  African-American  students  or  currently \nretains  vestiges  of the  prior  de jure  system  of segregation  which  have  not  been \nremedied to the extent practicable over the thirty-plus years ofthis litigation. \n(C) If the answer to question A is no, the Court must determine whether \nthe race-based student assignment plan is sufficiently narrowly tailored to remedy the \nadverse impact of any vestige found to still discriminate so as to comply with the strict \n23 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 23 of 55\n\nscrutiny test used to measures the constitutionality of a governmental use of race as an \nremedial measure?  See People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. OfEduc.,111 F. 3d at 535. \n(D) If the Court finds CMS to be unitary in student assIgnment but that \nvestiges  remain  in  areas  other than  student  assignment,  the  Court  must  consider \nwhether any vestiges found to remain are so bound up with student assignment that \nretention of racial policies and judicial control of student assignment is necessary in \norder to ensure that unitary status is achieved in that other area.  See Freeman v. Pitts, \n503 U.S. at 497-98. \n2. Constitutional Injuries \n\\3 \n(A) Race-based Magnet admissions: Whether the use of a racial quota to \ndetermine admission to CMS magnet school programs implemented by running two \nseparate lotteries for African-American and all non-African American students, and \nracially  balancing  a school  which  was  not  and  would  not  be  in  violation  of the \napplicable court orders  constitutes unlawful and unconstitutional racial discrimination \nIntervenors have received constitutional injuries such that they have standing to pursue \n13 \nindividual claims for relief.

This Court has already found  that Intervenors have \ndemonstrated an interest in this matter and presented common questions of law and fact already at \nissue in this action.  Order of May 20, 1998.  Moreover, intervention is the appropriate means of \nresolving the claims of parents in school desegregation cases. Adams v.

Are the Grant Intervenors and Capacchione entitled to monetary damages, and \nto their reasonable expenses of litigation, including attorneys fees and expert witness \nas  compensation for the racial  discrimination they have  suffered and as  prevailing \nparties in this litigation? \nDISCUSSION OF LEGAL ISSUES \nA.  CMS IS A UNITARY SCHOOL SYSTEM \n(1) The Nature of a Unitary System and the Court's Remedial Power \nA \"unitary\" school system is one \"which has been brought into compliance \nwith the command of the Constitution.\"  Board of Educ.  of Oklahoma City Public \nSchools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-46 (1991). This definition ofunitariness was \nfollowed again in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467,112 S.Ct. 1430, 1443-44 (1992) and \nis a correct statement of current law.  Compliance with the Constitution in terms of \ndesegregation is both simple and complex - simple because the original constitutional \nviolation and the reason for the Court's intervention is a denial of equal protection to \nAfrican-American students, and complex because a multi-faceted inquiry is needed to \ndetermine whether compliance has been attained. \nIn this case, the parties do not really contend that CMS currently engages in \ndeliberate intentional discrimination against African American students.  Instead,  the \ncourt's inquiry must focus on the \"vestiges\" of de jure segregation alleged to be present \n26 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 26 of 55\n\nin  CMS and engage in intense factual scrutiny of the evidence.  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 \nU.S. at 474; Green, 391 U.S. at 439.  Those vestiges do not exist separate and apart \nfrom the  Constitutional violation based upon segregation of the races by law.  Rather, \nto  find  vestiges  of segregation, the Court must determine that  currently obtaining \nconditions possess a traceable link to the de jure system.  In other words, any presently \nobservable  disparity  must  be proximately caused  by  de jure segregation  or  other \ndiscriminatory action which is fairly attributable  to the school district.  See Freeman \nv. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 493-96.  In Freeman, the Court explained this principle thus: \nIn one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by state decree do \nremain in our society and in our schools.  Past wrongs to the black race, \nwrongs committed by the  State and  in its  name, are stubborn facts  of \nhistory.  And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.  But though we \ncannot escape our history, neither must we overstate its consequences in \nfixing  legal  responsibilities.  The  vestiges  of segregation that are the \nconcern of the  law in a school case may be subtle and  intangible but \nnonetheless they must be so real that they have a causal link to the de jure \nviolation being remedied. \n27 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 27 of 55\n\nId.  at  495-96  (emphasis  added).  Finally,  the  Court  must  find  that  any  vestiges \nremaining are susceptible to practicable remedial action by the Board which it has \nfailed to take. \nIt is a mistake to assume that all social ills visited upon once disfavored races \ncan  be  cured  by  resort  to  perpetual judicial  supervision  of local  school  systems. \nInstead, the guiding principle is one of restraint: \n[JJudicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional \nviolation and ... the nature of the violation determines the scope of the \nremedy.  A remedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate \nobjective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation. \nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 489 (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Similarly, \ndespite judicial supervision for decades, such supervision is intended as a \"temporary\" \nmeasure,  and  courts  must  restore  state  and  local  authority  to  governments  in \ncompliance with the Constitution.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247. \nCMS  erroneously contends  it  is  required  by  a court  order of ongoing  and \nindefinite effect to continue to populate its schools by using race as the controlling \nfactor in student assignment.  CMS has badly misread the Swann court's decades old \nadmonition/injunction not to resegregate the school system. This standard standing \n28 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 28 of 55\n\norder does not confer on CMS  an  indefinite right to  effectively \"discriminate\" by \nequating  a talismanic  \"60/40\"  (or  indeed  a \"no  majority  of minority\")  notion  of \ndiversity to equal education opportunity.  Moreover, CMS appears to ignore clear \nSupreme Court guidance as to the need for a school district to \"correct\" for private \nchoice and action for which it is not and could not be responsible.  Spangler, 427 U.S. \nat 436; Freeman,  503  U.S.  at 494-96.  This is nothing more than a restatement of \nrelevant principles of proximate cause:  the more distant in time the event, the less \nlikely it is to be a causative factor so as to require legal obligations to  attach.  See Id. \nat 491 & 496.  This is all the more true where, as here, CMS has acted in good faith \ntoward its black students and in complying with the court's orders.  Id. At 496. \nA formerly de jure segregated system has the duty and responsibility to take all \nnecessary  steps  to  eliminate  the  vestiges  of an  unconstitutional  de  jure  system. \nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 485.  However, \"when changes in the racial makeup of \nthe schools were caused by demographic shifts 'not attributable to any segregative acts \non  the  part of the  school  district,'\"  a court may not  require the  school  system to \nimplement a remedy.  Id. at 487 (quoting Pasadena Bd. Of Educ. V. Spangler, 427 U.S. \n424,  436  (1976)).  In  the  \"late  phases\"  of a desegregation  decree,  \"awkward,\" \n\"inconvenient\", and  \"bizarre\"  measures  are  not  required  to  achieve  constitutional \n29 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 29 of 55\n\ncompliance.  Freeman,  503 U.S. at 493 (explaining Swann).  Instead, the focus is on \nthe good faith of the school district.  See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496. \nWhere, as here, the school system has engaged in an ongoing effort over thirty \nyears to correct the initial constitutional violations, and has in fact engaged in an heroic \neffort to counteract demographic and other forces over which it had no control in order \nto maintain artificially high levels of racial balance in student assignment, there is little \ndoubt that the school system has worked in good faith to comply with the Constitution. \nMoreover, the fact that the vast majority of the schools were racially balanced despite \ndemographic  change  for  more  than  twenty  years  further  severs  any  currently \nobservable imbalance from the de jure violation.  Finally, most of the schools which \nCMS has identified as out of compliance with the Court order because they are racially \nidentifiable black were either de jure white or were not even built during the era of \nsegregation.  It is utterly impossible for such schools to reflect a vestige of segregation. \nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 478.  In order to qualifY as a vestige, a present condition \n\"must be tied to the discriminatory practices and policies that justified the ... decree ... \" \nin the first instance.  Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District, 197 FJd 854, 865 \n(9th Cir. 1998). Where a school system like CMS has devoted 30 years to removing all \nsystemwide  vestiges  of segregation to  the  extent  reasonably  practicable,  and  now \noperates within the command of the Constitution, a court may not impose any further \n30 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 30 of 55\n\naffinnative obligations on the school district which go beyond the requirements of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Any such effort simply has no basis in the Constitution. See \nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249. \n2).  CMS Has Previously Been Determined not to have Discriminated In \nSeveral Areas \nCMS has been detennined to have no racial discrimination in several areas by \nCourt  Order  entered  in  1975  from  which  no  appeal  was  taken.  Under those \n14 \ncircumstances both the doctrine of res judicata and the  well settled \"law of the case\" \nrule would preclude the relitigation of those issues. See Board of Ed.

Those  areas \nincluded  faculty,  staff,  transportation,  extracurricular  activities,  facilities  and,  of \nSee supra at p. 4-5. \n14 \n31 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 31 of 55\n\ncourse, student assignment.  Green, 391  U.S. at 435, 88  S.Ct. at  1692.  The Swann \nCourt provided a simple means by which to determine whether any of these Green \nfactors caused a constitutional violation; i.e., the perpetuation of a vestige of the former \ndual system that so adversely impacted attainment of a desegregated school system that \nunitary status could not be declared for the system in that particular area of operation: \n[W]here it is possible to identifY a \"white school\" or a \"Negro \nschool\" simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers \nand  staff, the quality of school  buildings and  equipment, or the \norganization of sports activities, a prima facie case of violation of \nsubstantive constitutional rights .. .is shown. \nSwann, 91 S.Ct. at 1277. \nHowever, any race-based remedy which goes far beyond the nature and scope \nof remedying  any  persisting  vestiges  conflicts  with  the  fundamental  principles \nexpressed in Missouri v. Jenkins,  U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 2038 (1995); see also People \nWho  Care v.  Rockford Bd. of Educ.,  III F.3d 528 (7th Cir.  1997).  For example, \nconformance to a systemwide racial percentages is not required by the Constitution. \nSee Stell v. Savannah-Chatham County Bd. ofEduc., 888 F.2d 82, 85 (lIth Cir. 1989); \nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280 n.14 (1977) (Milliken II). \n32 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 32 of 55\n\nThe Stell case is particularly instlUctive in this regard.  In that case, the district \ncourt had approved a desegregation plan which employed voluntary participation in \nmagnet programs to desegregate the schools.  However, all of the system's schools \nwere  not  within  plus  or minus  20%  of the  systemwide  student racial  ratios.  Id. \nPlaintiffs challenged the plan on appeal.  Despite the fact that the school system had \nnot been declared unitary and was not within plus or minus 20% (the court approved \nbenchmark), the Eleventh Circuit held that the statistical numbers were not controlling. \nId.  More than bare statistics was required to show \"segregation\" and the isolation of \nminority children.  Id. \nIt is clear the Swann court carefully reviewed a number of issues critical to the \nunitary status of this school system and found CMS to have eradicated all vestiges of \nthe dual system from most of its areas of operation as early as 1975. It is for this Court \nto interpret the meaning and intent of that 1975 Order and those that preceded it.  By \ngiving voice to its plain meaning, this Court will preempt many of the arguments CMS \nhas sought to use in order to delay the conferral of unitary status upon it. \nB.

Supp. at 704; People Who Care, 111 FJd at 535. \nFederal courts are not empowered to effect or approve a race·based remedy in \nthe absence of a constitutional violation.  Missouri v.

As \n~,40·41, \nJustice O'Connor has stated, \"[t]he unfortunate fact of racial imbalance and bias in our \nsociety, however pervasive or invidious, does not admit of judicial intervention absent \n34 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 34 of 55\n\na constitutional violation.\"  Missouri  v.

A race-based remedy to cure the vestiges of past discrimination requires a \n\"strong basis in evidence of the harm being remedied.\"  Miller v.

The evidence of \na constitutional violation must be specific to the area where a remedy is imposed and \ntraceable to the actions of the government.  Shaw v. Hunt, 515  U.S. _, 116 S.Ct. \n1894, 1906 (1996); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 288 (O'Connor, l, concurring).  Remedying \ngeneral \"societal\" discrimination is not within the power of the Court to compel.  rd.; \nShaw v. Hunt, 116 S.Ct. at 1906. \nThe current CMS SAP is a race-based governmental sponsored and implemented \nprogram originally intended to remedy any vestiges of the era of de jure segregation \nstudent assignment.  This Court should not permit the continued use of any race-based \nSAP where the racial balance or composition of the student body is not required in \norder  to  eliminate the  vestige  identified.  Nor  is  there  a strong  basis  in  evidence \n35 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 35 of 55\n\nestablishing that CMS intentionally violated any prior Court Order or engaged in any \nsegregative intentional discrimination against black students with respect to student \nassignment  subsequent to the removal of all vestiges of the fornler dual system. \nIn the area of student assignment expert testimony will establIsh the source of \nany statistical racial identifiability of any CMS school is not due to de jure segregation, \nor any vestige thereof, but to demographic  residential patterns unrelated to any act or \nomission of CMS.  This  fact  was known to  CMS  by  virtue of numerous  reports \nprepared  by  CMS  management  employees.  This  indisputable  fact  eliminates  any \ncorrelation between the relatively few so-called racially \"identifiable\" black  schools \nthat now exist and any conceivable vestige of the prior dual school system: \nIt  is  simply  not  always  the  case  that  demographic  forces  causing \npopulation change  bear any real  and  substantial  relation to  a de jure \nviolation, and the law need not proceed on that premise.  Further, as the \nde jure violation becomes more remote in time and demographic changes \nintervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school \ndistrict is a vestige of the prior de jure system.  The causal link between \ncurrent conditions and the prior violation is even more attenuated if the \nschool  district  has  demonstrated  its  good  faith  commitment  to  a \ndesegregation plan. \n36 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 36 of 55\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 495-96. \nThe fact CMS knew residential demographics were driving any so called racial \nimbalance in certain CMS schools was the subject of a major study completed in 1994 \nby former Assistant Superintendent Jeffrey Schiller, entitled Demographic Changes in \nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Community: Implications for School Integration (Schiller). \nDr. Schiller made the following findings: \n(1) \"There has been a change in school integration in CMS.  And, changing and \nshifting population patterns are the primary cause.\" Schiller at p. 7. \n(2) \"[T]here is no evidence that CMS policies or practices are responsible for the \nincrease in the percentage of black students attending predominantly black schools. \nThe increase in the percentage of black students attending predominantly black schools \nis mostly a result of black population growth in attendance areas that are already either \nintegrated or predominantly black.\" (Schiller, p. 16). \n(3) \"We know that the number of school-age children in ... [predominantly black \nattendance] areas are growing, yet, the growth occurred in the black population while \nthe white population actually declined.  We know the number of school age children \nin these areas no  longer reflects the systemwide ratio of 60/40. In fact,  the ratio is \nalmost  reversed  with  black  children  becoming  almost  60%  of the  school  age \npopulation.\" (Schiller, p. 17). \n37 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 37 of 55\n\n(4) \"We also know that as the inner city neighborhoods became \"blacker\" their \nsuburban counterparts became 'whiter'.\" (Id.) \n(5)  \"An  examination  of student  assignment  records  showed  that  no  policy \ndecisions were made to concentrate black students into particular schools. In fact, the \nopposite  is  true.  Generally,  elementary  school  zones  were  irregularly  shaped ... to \ninclude ... an appropriate number of black and white children to meet court guidelines.\" \n(Schiller, p. 19, emphasis added). \n(6) \" ... [SJatellite attendance zones were created, adjusted, or dissolved based \nupon the impact they had on the racial  balance of their assigned school.  In other \nwords, the intent of the changes in student assignment was, in part, to insure that the \nblack ratios in schools met court guidelines.  These methods of student assignn1ent are \nindicative of the annual  'tinkering'  that occurred over the years ... \"(Schiller, p . 19 \nemphasis added). \nIn the present case, the attempt by CMS to link its new allegations of unequal \neducational opportunity to a de jure system of segregation in student assignment that \nended thirty (30) years ago is nothing more than rank speculation and contrary to logic. \nIn his report, Dr. Armor established that CMS schools, on the whole, were well within \npennissible deviations from their systemwide racial percentages for more than twenty \n(20)  years.  It is  therefore  highly  unlikely that  any  current  racial  imbalance  in  an \n38 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 38 of 55\n\nisolated school is due to any vestige of 30 year old de jure segregation. Incredibly, \nsome of the schools CMS points to as \"racially identifiable\" black schools were, at the \ntime of de jute segregation, white schools and vice versa.  It takes more than this kind \nof rank speculation to justifY the rather incredible contention that lingering effects of \nsegregation have caused a formerly de jure black school to become majority white. \nThe evidence will show that any \"racial identifiability\"  of a particular CMS \nschool was caused by interaction of (l) residential demographics; (2) private parental \ndecisionmaking and (3) economics.  If a school's racial makeup is due to residential \ndemographics, population growth trends, or other factors unrelated to governmental \nrace-based decisions, there is no remediable discrimination.  See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 \nU.S. 467, 495, (1992); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 402 U.S. 1,31-\n32 (1971). \nA school system is under no duty to remedy imbalance caused by demographic \nfactors. \nThe vestiges of segregation that are the concern ofthe law in a school case may \nbe subtle and intangible but nonetheless they must be so real that they have a \ncausal link to the de jure violation being remedied.  It is simply not always the \ncase  that  demographic  forces  causing  population  change  bear any  real  and \nsubstantial relation to a de jure violation.  And the law need not proceed on that \npremise. \nFreeman,  112  S.Ct. at  1448.  Unless any observable chronic racial  imbalance in a \nschool can be traced to a demonstrable constitutional violation perpetrated by CMS \n39 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 39 of 55\n\nspecifically  with  respect  to  student  assignment,  this  Court  should  not  pennit the \ngratuitous use of race to annually \"rebalance\" the racial composition of the district's \nschools. Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1446 (1992). \nThe newly proposed CMS  Controlled Choice Plan (CC Plan)I5,  exeeeds the \nremedial powers of this Court, by perpetuating a race based SAP.  It will not be serve \nan acceptable race neutral alternative SAP.  Therefore, the Court must not allow the \nCC  Plan to  be  implemented as  an  alternative to  the current  plan.  This  plan also \nexceeds the authority of CMS to enact a student assignment plan of its own, as it is not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental objective. \n11.  The Current SAP Is Not Narrowly Tailored To Serve The Limited Purpose \nOf Remedying Any Remaining Vestiges \nA government may not use race to burden or benefit, to classify or circumscribe, \nto define or deprive its citizens of a pub lie benefit.  Race-based deeision making by \ngovernments is what caused the problem of segregation to begin with.  Race is far too \ndangerous an element, absent a credible showing that the use of race is the only means \nby  which to  remedy an  injury caused by discrimination, to  constitutionally pennit \nIn response to this suit and apparently anticipating the imminent demise of the quota \n15 \ndriven SAP now in place, CMS will urge the Court to permit it to adopt a Controlled Choice Plan \nabominably known as the \"Family Choice Cluster Plan\".  We expect to  present evidence that \nControlled Choice is an aggressive desegregation technique in the area of student assignment that \nprovides tight substantive control over a school's racial composition because it allows CMS to \ncontrol for the race of every student in the system. It would be anomalous to replace the existing \nunconstitutional plan with a plan that potentially uses race to a greater degree. \n40 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 40 of 55\n\ngovernments  to  use  it  as  a criteria by  which  citizens  - students  are  burdened  or \nbenefitted. To use an accessible metaphor:  Governmental use of race in classitying its \ncitizens is  analogous to radiation therapy.  Radiation treatment -- itself potentially \ndeadly -- can be justified to  treat serious diseases  such as cancer if used in small, \ncontrolled doses directly applied to the cancerous cells.  Unchecked, nuclear radiation \ncauses death and deformity well into future generations.  Similarly, a government must \nuse race sparingly, in a narrowly targeted fashion, and only for the most serious of \nconstitutional infirmities when no other remedy will suftice. \nIn holding a Majority to Minority Transfer program unconstitutional, the Court \nin EOEA explained the problem well: \nThe policy denied white children the opportunity to go to a school of their \nchoice but, perhaps more importantly, through its policy the school board \ntells those whom it is charged to educate that they are less entitled to the \nbenefit of the law solely because of the color of their skin.  At the same \ntime,  the  policy sends  a contradictory message that  the  school  board \nvalues white students but places a smaller value on its nonwhite students \nwho are free to transfer out of the district.  These effects demonstrate the \ninsidious nature of race-based distinctions:  A stigma is placed on all of \nthose whom the policy seeks to divide. \nEOEA, 937 F. Supp. at 708.  For these reasons, neither a court nor a government may \nutilize such a hazardous remedy as a race-based classification without both a strong \nbasis in evidence of the actual discrimination to be remedied and a narrow tailoring of \nany race-based remedy. \n41 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 41 of 55\n\nThe current CMS  SAP, as well as the newly proposed CC Plan, are patently \nrace-based measures that cannot peacefully co-exist with a unitary (nonracial) school \nsystem. As such, they are subject to strict scrutiny.  It has been shown IDJllli! that there \nis  no  strong  basis  in  evidence  for  concluding  that  CMS  committed  any  material \nviolation of a prior Court Order or of the Constitution.  Therefore, CMS  can not \nestablish a compelling  interest  which justifies the  employment  of any  race-based \nremedy.  See EOEA, 937 F.

The Courts have rejected this notion. \nSee Part C. infra. \n42 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 42 of 55\n\nv.

Controlled Choice is not. \nThe absence of any ongoing \"narrow tailoring\" by CMS of its SAP is well \nillustrated by the Magnet School Program (MSP).  CMS  employs a racial quota, \nderived  from  the  district's racial  demographics,  as  the  basis  for  conducting two \nseparate lotteries, one for black students and one for all other students17 in an effort \n, \nto create the \"perfect\" 60/40 composition of students in each magnet school.  If one \nrace fails to apply in numbers sufficient to fill  its quota, those seats are left vacant \ndespite over subscription by the other race.  CMS creates waiting lists by race for \nadmission.  This  policy  of purposefully  excluding  students  to  maximize  \"racial \ndiversity\" (interims of the racial ratio of Black and white which includes all other \nminority) is not narrowly tailored to the limited constitutional task of insuring equal \nAfrican American access to the program.  Obviously, there is no legal authority or \nconstitutional basis for  contending that black children should be denied access to a \n17Minorities other than African Americans are counted as Caucasian students by CMS \nlargely for historical reasons which are no longer valid.  CMS has, over the past two decades, \nexperienced substantial increase in  Asian and Hispanic students.  These other minorities now \nconstitute approximately 10% of the District. \n43 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 43 of 55\n\nmagnet school program  because the  seats (40%)  allotted to  their race  have  been \noversubscribed,  while  the  seats  (60%)  allotted  for  white  students  (and  other \nminorities) were under subscribed and the school's capacity is capable of accepting \nthose  wait listed black students who  failed  to  gain admission through  the  initial \nlottery. \nThe  admission  quotas  for  the  MSP  have  caused both deserving black and \nwhite students to be excluded. It creates situations where highly desirable schools \nwith  specialized  and  unique  programming  unavailable  elsewhere  in  the  system \nactually  go  underutilized.  Furthermore,  CMS  uses  its  MSP  quotas  to  obtain  a \ncertain percentage of black students in a magnet school - like Olde Providence -\nwhich but for the racial set asides, would have a predominately white student body. \nSince  this  condition  would  not  violate  the  Court's  orders,  the  MSP  quota  is \nobviously  not  tailored  to  any  real  or  alleged  remedial  purpose;  much  less  to \ncomplying with this Court's orders. This result is the product of how racial quotas \nwork at their very worst. \nIn sum, the quantum of race used in the current SAP, including the MSP, is \nbroader and far more invasive than any potential residual vestige in the area of student \nassignment could justifY.  Given the boundaries of the constitutionally permissible use \nof race in remedial schemes, the current SAP far exceeds what would be required to \n44 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 44 of 55\n\nremedy a violation of the Constitution, even if such a violation were present.  There is \nno basis in law to require CMS to make each school's student body mirror the  racial \ncomposition of the entire school system, when it acknowledges residential patterns \nvary widely from that ratio throughout the CMS service area.  This type of racial quota \nis egregiously overinclusive, requiring more governmental intervention and disruption \nof a proximity based, common sense student assignment plan than would be required \nto remedy any potential remaining vestiges (assuming any could be shown to still exist \n30 years after CMS implemented remedial measures). \nCMS is seeking to have this Court sanction its longstanding adherence  to an \nSAP based on its political preference for student bodies with racial ratios plus or minus \n15% of district racial composition for all  150 plus schools.  This is far too strict a \nstandard since \"[tlhe Supreme Court has made clear that, while racial ratios provide a \nuseful tool for analyzing various plans, they are not to be used as rigid barriers.\"  rd. \nIn the words of Judge Posner, such a cramped leeway is \"a misplaced exactitude,\" not \na narrowly  focused  remedy.  People  Who  Care,  III  FJd at  536.  Given  the \nacknowledged effect the dramatic demographic shifts predicted by the Supreme Court \nin  Swann have had on the racial composition of many CMS  schools,  it would be \nimpossible to constitutionally justifY any attempt by CMS to \"remedy\" the effects of \nprivate and voluntary housing choices. \n45 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 45 of 55\n\nAs a last gasp effort to save its commitment to government engendered \"racial \n'diversity', CMS now purports to \"confess\" to discrimination in the desegregation of \nits  faculty,  the maintenance of its  facilities  and the  education of underperforming \nstudents. It is telling that CMS only \"confessed\" these alleged shortcomings after the \ncase was reactivated.  Although it had no formal remedial plan in place to address these \nalleged  deficiencies,  it  is  clear  from  the  evidence  that  CMS  employees, \nsuperintendents, and Board members have worked diligently to address any identified \nshortcomings,  such  as  by  implementation  of the  'Bright  Beginnings'  program  to \nimprove achievement, and to insure equitable distribution of funding, as shown in the \nallocation of bond money.It is also telling the Swann plaintiffs never filed a single \nmotion in twenty plus years to renew court supervision of the case, or to remedy any \ndiscrimination or other deficiency in the progress ofCMS towards unitary status. \nThe plain fact of the matter is that these eleventh hour confessions by CMS of \nalleged deficiencies in facilities and faculty will not save an unconstitutional SAP. \nOne  may  not  base  the  need  for  a student  assignment  remedy  on,  for  example, \ndiscrimination in faculty hiring.  Sec Freeman v. Pitts, 112 S.Ct. 1430.  The remedy \nfor  any  alleged  shortcomings  in  other areas  of the  district's  operations,  assuming \nsufficient  evidence  of such  violations  is  presented,  would  address  those  specific \nconditions.  That does not require the continued mandatory student assignment based \n46 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 46 of 55\n\non race.  See Id.; EOEA, 937 F. Supp. at 707-08; Milliken II, 433 U.S. at 280.  Any \nremaining vestige with respect to faculty or facilities is not of the same nature as a \nvestige in student assignment since any changes in student assignment will not have \nany effect on governmental decisions regarding the hiring and assigiiment of faculty \nor the decision to upgrade a facility. \nBased  on  the  facts  and  evidence  presented  in  this  case,  the  indefinite \ncontinuation of the race-based SAP is unconstitutional.  That is because the current \nSAP exceeds both the nature and scope of any potential remedy for any remaining \nvestige.  There is an insufficient basis in fact to conclude, as CMS would have,  that \nperpetuation of drastic race-based remedies is necessary because almost thirty years \noftight racial controls have failed to desegregate CMS.  Accordingly, this Court should \ngrant the Grant Intervenors and Capacchione relief by declaring the current CMS SAP \nunconstitutional.  The Court is authorized  to  declare CMS a unitary school system, \nparticularly  in  the  area  of student  assignment.  CMS  should  also  be  permanently \nenjoined from continuing to assign students on the basis of race in the future and from \nemploying the newly proposed CC Plan as an alternative to its current unconstitutional \nplan. \nC.  RACIAL DIVERSITY IS NOT A  COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL \nINTEREST \n47 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 47 of 55\n\nIn this case, CMS has plainly stated its desire and intent to continue to use race-\nbased student assignment techniques beyond those needed to eliminate  the vestiges of \nthe  former  dual  system  for  purposes  of increasing  racial  diversity  within  system \nschools.18  This  gratuitous  use  of race  flatly  contravenes  current -Supreme  Court \nprecedent and does violence to the original Swann opinion itself which wisely stated: \nThe elimination of racial discrimination in public schools is a large task and one \nthat should not be retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond \nthe jurisdiction of school authorities. \nSwann, 91  S.Ct. at 1279.  The Supreme Court has continued to uphold this principle \nin  declaring that school  integration cannot  remedy all  \"stubborn facts  of history\". \nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 495-96.  Furthermore, CMS' proposed perpetual use of \nrace conscious student assignment measures to obtain an undefinable diversity in its \nschools  is  contrary  to  the  Equal  Protection  Clause's  \"central  mandate  [of]  racial \nneutrality in governmental decisionmaking.\"  Miller v.  Johnson, 515  U.S. 900, 904 \n(1995). \nAs the Supreme Court observed in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 115 S.Ct. \n2475,2486 (l995)(internal citations omitted): \n\"eMS has ... a policy of maintaining racial diversity in its schools.  eMS has adopted this \n18 \nas  a  sound  educational  policy ... to  assign  students  to  schools  (toJ  create  and  foster  the  best \neducational environment...and achieve the educational benefits that flow from [racial] diversity \namong students ... \".  See eMS Answer, Third Defense at p. 12. \n48 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 48 of 55\n\"\"\"'~'''-------------------------------\n\nWhen the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive \nand demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of their race, \n\"think  alike,  share  the  same  political  interests,  and  will  prefer  the  same \ncandidates at the polls.\"  Race-based assignments \"embody stereotypes that treat \nindividuals as the product of their race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts - \ntheir very worth as citizens -- according to a criterion barred to the Government \nby history and the Constitution.\"  They also cause society serious harm. \nrd. At 904. \nIt is partially because of that potential for stigmatization and stereotyping that \n\"racial diversity\" has been determined to be  insufficient to meet the demands \nof strict scrutiny.  Hopwood v. State of Texas, 78 FJd 932, 944-48 (5th  Cir. \n1996), held that \nAccordingly, we see the case  law as  sufficiently established that the use of \nethnic  diversity  simply  to  achieve  racial  heterogeneity  even  as  part  of the \nconsideration of  number of factors, is unconstitutional. \n~ \nId. at 945-46. \nThe issue of racial diversity as a compelling state interest was examined by the \nFirst Circuit in Taxman v. Board of Education of Township of Piscataway, 91  FJd \n1547 (3rd Cir. 1996).19 The plaintiff won ajudgment for racial discrimination and that \njudgment was affirmed by the Third Circuit in a lengthy opinion that examines the \ncurrent state of the law on the use of race by a governmental entity in the conferral of \nemployment-related public benefits.  The Taxman court followed Hopwood, supra, in \nrejecting \"diversity\" as a sufficiently compelling reason to engage in the race-based \nThe case was to be decided by the United States Supreme Court until an eleventh hour \n19 \nsettlement funded principally by civil rights groups, was reached to payoff plaintiffs' judgment and \nresolve the case. \n49 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 49 of 55\n.~--------------------------------~~.~~-\n\nconferral of public benefits. Still more recently, the First Circuit has noted that a vague \nnotion  of \"diversity\"  is  insufficient  as  a  compelling  interest  in  the  absence  of \nevidentiarily  supported reasons and sufficient definition.  Wessman v.  Gittens, _ \nF.3d _, 1998 WL 792148 (1  Cir. 1998). The clear weight of authority from courts \nst \nwhich  have  examined this  issue have held that racial  diversity is  an  insufficiently \ncompelling interest to withstand strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Hopwood v. State of Texas, \n78 FJd 932 (5th Cir. 1996); Equal Open Enrollment Ass'n (EOEA) v. Board ofEduc. \nof Akron City School Dist., 937 F. Supp. 700, 709 (N.D. Ohio 1996); Taxman v. City \nof Piscataway, 91 FJd 1547 (3d Cir. 1996); Hitler v. County of Suffolk, 977 F. Supp. \n202  (E.D.N.Y.  1997);  Rader  v.  Johnston,  924  F.  Supp.  1540  (D.  Neb.  1996); \nWessman v. Gittens, _  FJd _, 1998 WL 792148 (1  Cir. 1998). \nst \nEven if this Court found  racial diversity to  be a compelling interest, CMS's \npolicy is not narrowly tailored to any compelling interest. See People Who Care, III \nFJd at  534; EOEA, 937 F.  Supp. at 707;  Jenkins,  115  S.Ct. at 2048; Milliken v. \nBradley, 418 U.S. 717,746 (1974) (Milliken I)); Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, \n270  (1977)  (Milliken  II).  Defendants'  race-based  student  assignment  policy  is \napparently of unlimited duration to be implemented as long as the Defendants believe \nthat the ratio between Black and White students can be improved. \"Even if 'diversity' \nwere defined, the plan does not indicate that it will end when diversity is achieved.\" \n50 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 50 of 55\n\nTaxman, 832 F.Supp. at 850.  Such a policy does not involve a \"temporary\" measure \nthat seeks to \"attain\" rather than \"maintain\" a \"permanent racial...balance.\" Johnson, \n480 U.S. at 639-40; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. \nFinally, to be narrowly tailored, CMS's SAP must be designed and employed \nso as to harm the fewest number of innocent parties and targeted to reach its intended \nbeneficiaries. Wessman v. Gittens,  1998 WL 792148 (1'( Cir.  1998); Podberesky v. \nKirwan, 38 FJd 147 (4th Cir. 1994).  This is not the case here, where CMS is engaged \nin overcorrecting for factors clearly beyond its control, imposing tighter racial quotas \nthan what the law or this Court's orders require, and  attempting to justifY its continued \nstranglehold on student racial mix by claiming other goals have not yet been attained. \nCMS's SAP misses the constitutional mark and is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to \nsurvive strict scrutiny. \nV:  CONCLUSION \nAlthough CMS has maintained to this Court that it believes itself not yet unitary \nin any regard, the evidence tells a different story.  It tells the story of a school system \nwhich worked hard to make a desegregation remedy work  and kept working at it for \nmore than twenty years.  When it became evident in the early 19908 that the old SAP \nwas failing to maintain the level of desegregation the district had come to desire wholly \napart from the reasons behind its inception, CMS kept trying, through an altered SAP \n51 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 488   Filed 04/12/99   Page 51 of 55\n\nand new programs and policies, to be the \"premier desegregated  urban school system \nin the nation.\"  The problem here is that when CMS  attained those goals as  far as \npracticable, it did not stop. \nIgnoring its own documents, the law,  and the realities ofthe situation, CMS has \nin effect said: We can continue our politically popular stance, gain more federal funds, \nand remain invested in our self-image if we keep race-based policies in place.  This \nis too high a price to pay for the constitutional rights of Charlotte's citizens.  CMS \nshould be proud of its accomplishments as the city that made it work.  However, when \nthat same entity is practicing on its youngest, most vulnerable citizens policies which \ndeclare their color to be the most important thing about them, it has gone too far.  The \nparents, students, and eitizens of Charlotte-Mecklenburg County deserve better.  They \ndeserve a declaration that CMS has attained unitary status and must be enjoined from \nfurther race-based student assignment policies. \nRespectfully submitted this day, April  11.1-'\"  , 1999. \n71 \nParks, Chesin  A.

Such  plan should try to avoid \nany  re-zoning  which  tends  to  perpetuate  segregated  pupil \nassignment.  The  Board is  free  to  consider  all  lrnown  ways \nof desegregation, including hussing  (the economics  of which \nmight pleasantly surprise the ta.xpayers) ; pairing of grades \nor  of  schools;  enlargement  and  I'c-alignment  of  existing \n7.Ones;  freedom  of  transfer  coupled  with  free  transporta \ntion  for  those  who  elect  to  abandon  de  facto  segregated \nschools;  and  any  other  methods  calculated  to  establish  ed \nucation  as  a  public  program  operated  according  to  its  own \nindependent  standards,  and  unhampered  and  uncontrolled \nby the  race  of  the faculty  or  pupils  or  the  temporary  hous \ning  patterns  of  the  community. \nTHE  LAW  WHICH  GOVERNS \nThis  case  vitally  affects  83 OOO  school  children  of  Char \nt\nlotte  and  Mecklenburg  County  and  their  families.  'fhat \nmeans virtually all of  us.

This  de  jure  segregation  was  outlawed  by  the \ntwo  decisions  of the  Supreme  Court  in  Brown  Board  of \ny. \nEduca.tion}  347  U.  S.  483  (1954)  and  349  U.  S.  294  (1955). \nThe  first  Brown  opinion  held  that  racial  segregation  of \nschools  by  law  was  unconstitutional  because  racial  segrc \ngatioIl,  even  though  the  physical  facilities  and  other  tan \ngible  factors  might  be  equal,  deprives  Negro  children  of \nequal  educational  opportunities.  The  Court  recnlled  prior \ndecisions  that  segregation  of  graduate  students  was  un \nlawful  because  it  restricted  the  student's  \"ability  to  study, \nto  engage  in  discussions  and  exchange  views  with  other \nstudents,  and,  in  general,  to  lea  his  profession.\"  The \nI'll \nCourt said: \n\"Such  considerations  apply  with  added  force  to  chil \ndren  in  grade  and  high  schools.  To  separate  them \nfrom  others  of  similar  age  qualifications  solely \nUlld \nbecause  of their  race  generates  a  feeling  of  inferiority \nas  to  their  status  in  the  community  that  may  affect \ntheir  heart.s  fmd  minds  in  a  way  unlikely  e\\'er  to  be \nundone.\" \nQuoting  a  lower  court  opinion,  the  Supreme  Court  con \ntinued : \n\"'Segregation  of  white  and  colored  children  in  public \nschools  has  a  detrimental  effect  upon  the  colored \nchildl'en.  The  impact  is  greater  when  it  has  the  sanc \ntion  of  the  law;  for  the  policy  of  sepa rating  the  races \nis  usually  interpreted  as  denoting  the  inferiority  of \nthe  Negro  gl·oup.  A  sense  of  inferiority  affects  the \nmotivation  of  a  child  to  learn.  Segregation  with  the \nsanction  of  law,  therefore,  hns  a  tendency  to  [retard] \n\n-\n--\n_. \n4a \nOpinion and Order Dated April  Etc. \n23, 1969, \nthe  educational and  mental  development  of  Negro  chil \nclren  and  to  deprive  them  of  some  of  the  iJenefits  they \nwould  receive  in  a  racial [ly]  integrated  school  system.' \n\"We  conclude  that  in  the  field  of  public  etlucation  the \ndoctrine  of  'separate but  efJual'  has  no  place.  Separate \neducational  facilities  are  inherently  unequal.  . . .\"  \nThe  secontl  Brown  case,  deciderl  May  31,  1955,  directed \nschool  boards  to  do  whatever  was  necessary  to  carTY  out \nthe  Court's  directive  as  to  the  pending  cases  \"with  all  de \nliberate  speed\"  (349  U.

The \nfOI\" \nCourt said: \n\"It  was  such  dual  systems  that  14  years  ago  Brown  I \nheld  unconstitutional  and  a  year  later  Brown  I I  held \nmust be  abolished;  school boards operating sucb  school \nsystems  were  required  by  Brown  II  'to  effectuate  a \ntransition  to  a  racially  nondiscriminatory  school  sys \ntem.'  349  U.

It  is  of  courSe  true  that  for \nthe  time  immediately  after  Brown  II  the  concern  was \nwith  making  an  initial  break  in  a  long-established \npattern  of  excluding  Negro  children  from  schools  at \ntended  by  white  children.  The  principal  focus  was  on \nobtaining for  those  Negro  children  courageous  enough \nto  break  'with  tradition  a  place  in  the  'white'  schools. \nSee,  e.  g.,  Cooper  v.

Of  these  students,  about \n% \n29ro  are  Negro  and  about  71  are  white.  The  ratio  of \nblack  to  white  of  all  ages  in  the  county  is  about  one  to \nthree. \nThe  5,880  school  employees  include  3,553  classroom \nteachers;  404  other  members  of  the  instructional  stat!  in \ncluding  principals,  directors  and  special  staff  members. \nThese  include  60  guidance  counselors  and  114  librarians. \nOther  employees  include  325  secretaries  and  other  clerical \nemployees,  995  cafeteria employees,  357  janitors and maids, \n219  maintenance  and  transportation workers  and  27  people \nassigned  to  educational  television  work.

Charlotte  (2\"70,OOO-plllS)  sits  in  the  center  of \nMecklenburg  Connty  (550  square  miles,  total  population \nover  335,000).  The central  city  may  be  likened  to  an  auto \nmobile  hub  cap,  the  perimeter  area  to  a  wheel,  and  the \ncounty  area  to  the  rubber  tire.  Tryon  Stroet  and  the \nSouthern  Hailroad  run  generally  through  the  county  and \nthe  city  from  northeast  to  southwest.  Trade  Street  runs \ngenerally  northwest  to  southeast  and  Cl'osses  Tryon  Street \nat  the  centcr  of  town  at  Indepcndence  Square.  Charlotte \noriginally  grew  along  the  Southern  railroad  tracks.  Tex \ntile  mills  with  mill  villages,  once  entirely  white, \nalmo~t \nwere  built.  Business  and  other  iudustry  followed  the  high \nways  and  the  railroad.  The  railroad  and  parallel  highways \nand  business and  industrial  deVelopment formed  somethi.ng \nof  a  barrier  between  east  and  west. \nBy  the  end  of  World  War  II  many  Negro  families  lived \nin  the  center of Charlotte  just caf)t  of  hldependence  Square \nin  what  is  known  as  the  First  Ward  Second  Ward  . \nCherry  Brooklyn  area.  However,  the  bulk  of  Charlotte's \nblack  population  lived  west  of  the  railroad  and  Tryon \nStreet,  and  north  of  Trade  Street,  ill  the  northwest  part \nof  town.  The  high  priced,  almost  exclusively  white,  coun \ntry  was  east  of  Tryon  Street  and  south  of  Trade  in  the \nMyers  Park  Providence  Sharon  Eastover  areas.  Char \nlotte  thus had  a  very high  degree  of  segregation of  housing \nbefore  the  first  Brown  decision. \nAmong  the  forces  which  brought  about  these  concentra \ntions  should  be  listed  the  original  loeation  of  industry \nalong  and  to  the  west  of  the  Southem  raill'oall;  the  loca \ntion  of  Johnson  C.  Smith  University  two  miles  west  of \nTryon  Street;  the  choiee  of  huilders  in  the  early  1900's \nto  go  south  and  east instead  of  west  for  high  priced  dwell \ning  construction;  the  effect  of  private  action  and  public \nlaw  on  choice  of  dwelling  sites  by  black  and  by  white  pnr-\n\nI3a \nOpinion alld Order  Dated Apri123,  Etc. \n1[)69, \nchasers  or  renters;  real  estate  zoning  which  began  in  1947; \nand  the  economics  of  the  situation  which  lire  that  Negroes \nhave  earned  less  money  and  have  been  less  able  to  buy  or \nrent  expellsi ve  Ii ving  quarter:!. \nLocal  zoning  ordina.nces  starting  in  1947  generally  allow \nmore  varied  uses  in  the  west  than  ill  the  east.  Few  if  any \nareas  identified  as  black  have  a  residential  restriction \nstronger  than  R-B,  which  means  tLmt  a  house  can  be  built \non  a  lot  as  small  as  6,000  square  feet.  Zoning  restrictions \nin  other  areas  go  as  high  as  12,000  mId  15,000  square  feet \nper  lot.  Nearly  all  industl'ialland  in  the  city  is in  the  west. \nThe  airport  il1  the  southwest.  with  it.s  jet ail'  t.raffic  inhibits \nresidential  development.  MallY  blaek  citiz.ens  live  in  areas \nzoned  industrial,  which  means  tbat  the  zOlling  In w  places \nrestrictiOll  on  the  use  of  the  land.

In  the  last  fifteen  years  grade  crossings \nbave  been  eliminated  at  great  expense  at  Fourt.h  Street, \nTrade  Street,  Twelfth  Street  a nel  Independence  Boule \nrd;  amI  an  cleva ted  half-mile  bridge,  the  Brodie  Griffith \nVH \nSkyway,  is  nOw  being  built  Hcross  the  railroad  in  North \nCharlotte  at  a.  cost  of  more  than  t.hree  Dlillion  dollars.

U neler  the  urban  renewal  program  thousands  of \nNegroes  were  moved  out  of  thei I'  shotgnn  hOll!'CS  in  the \ncenter  of  town  and  have  relocated  ill  t.he  low  rent  areas \nto  t.he  west.  This  I'elocat.ion  of  course  involved  many  ad \n\n14a \nOlJinion atld Order  Dated AprU  Etc. \n23, 1969, \nhoc  decisions  by  individuals  and  by  city,  county,  state  and \nfederal  governments.  Federal  agencies  (which  hold  the \nstrings  to  large  federal  purses)  reportedly  disclaim  any \nresponsibility  for  the  direction  of  the  migration;  they  re \nportedly  say  that  the  selection  of  urban  renewal  sites  and \nthe  relocation  of  displaced  pen;ons  are  matters  of decision \nn \n(\"freedom  of  choice\"  by  local  individuals  and  govern \nments.  This  may be  correct;  the  clca r  fact  however  is  that \nthe displacement occurred with  heavy  federal  financing  and \nwith  active  participation  by  local  governments,  and  it  has \nfurther  concentrated  Negroes  until  9570  or  so  of  the  city's \nNegroes  live  west  of  the  Tryon  railroad  area,  or  all  its \nimmediate  eastern  fringes. \nOnto  this  migration  the  1965  school  zone  plan  with  free \ndom  of  transfer  was  superimposed.  The  Board  accurately \npredicted  that  black  pupils  would  be  moved  out  of  their \nmidtown  shotgun  housing  and  that  white  residents  would \ncontinue  to  move  generally  south  and  east.  Schools  were \nbuilt  to  meet  both  groups.  Black  or  nearly  black  schools \nresulted  in  the  northwest  and  white  or  nearly  aU  white \nschools  resulted  in  the  east  and  southeast.  Freedom  of \nstudents  of  both  races  to  transfer freely  to  schools  of  their \nown  choices  has  resulted  in  rcsegregation  of  SODle  schools \nwhich  were  temporarily  desegregated.  The  effect  of  clos \ning  the  black  inner-city  schools  and  allowing  free  choices \nhas  in  overall  result  tended  to  perpetuate  and  promote \nsegregation. \nTo \nSOME  BOARD  ACTIONS  FOUND  NOT  BE  DISCRlMINATORY \nNo  racial  discrimination  or  inequality  is  found  in  the \nfollowing  disputed  matters: \n1.  The  use  of  federal  funds  for  specia,l  aid  to  the  dis \nadvantaged.

Use  of mob·ile  classrooms.  In  recent  years  the  system \nhas  required  the  addition  of  nearly  two  classrooms  per \nweek.  Mobile  classrooms  have  been  used  to  provide  extra \nspace  temporarily  to  cope  with  shifts  and  growth  in  school \npopUlation.  Mobiles  are  not  inferior  in  quality  and  com \nfort  to  permanent  classrooms,  and  recent  models  are  supe \nrior in many ways  to  many  existing permanent classrooms. \nTheir  use  and  location  are  matters  to  be  determined  by \nthe  Board  in  light  of  the  court's  instructions  hereafter  on \nthe  preparation  of a  new  plan  for  pupil  assignment. \n3.  The  quality  of  the  school  buildings  and  equipment. \nThe  evidence  showed  the  per  pnpil  value  of  the  land  and \nbuildings  and  equipment  of  the  variolls  schools.  Average \nvalue  of  these  items  per  pupil  for  elementary  schools  was \n$861;  for  junior  high  schools  $1,229;  and  for  senior  high \nschools  $1,567.  Schools  described  by  witnesses  as  \"white\" \nranged  well  up  and  down  on  both  sides  of  that  average \nfigure  and  schools described  witnesses  as  \"black\" showed \nby \na  similar  variation.  Several  of  the  oldest  and  most  re \nspected  \"white\"  elementary  schools  in  the  county  (Sharon \nRoad  and  Steele  Creek,  for  example)  have  very  low  per \npupil  facilities  values.  One  of  the  newest bllt  still  all  black \nhigh  schools  (\\V cst  Charlotto)  has  one  of  the  highest  per \npupil  facilities  values.  The  highest  priced  school  (Olympic \nHigh)  is  totally  desegregated  (522  white  and  259  black \nstudents).  No  racial  discrimination  in  spending  money  or \nproviding  facilities  appears. \n4.  Coaching  of  athletics.  Coaches  at  the  predominantly \nblack  schools  are  usually  black.  Coaches  at  the  predomi-\n\n16a \nOpinion  and  Order Dated  Etc. \nApJ'i123, 19G9, \nantly white  sehools are usually white.  Several black eoaches \nhave been  elllployed at \"white\" schools.  No  hlack  coaeh was \nshown  to  have  applicd  and  been  refused  a  joh.  No  pattern \nof  discrimination  appears  in  the  coaching  ranks. \n5.

School  fees.  I t   was  contended  that  the  school  fee \nsystem  is  discriminatory.  For  example,  at  the  elementary \nlevel,  grades 1  through  6,  each  !;tudent  is  ::iupposed  to  bring \na  dollar  to  school  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  to  provide \nsome extra learning aids in  the form  of  paper, art materials \nand  the  like.  In  communities  collection  of  this  fee \npOOl' \naverages  only  about  5070,  whereas  nearly  all  wealthy \nchildren  pay  all  the  fees  assessed  in  their  schools.  This \nnon-payment  of  school  fees  by  the  poor  is  not  a  racial \ndiscrimination  against  the  The  schools  where  people \nPOOl'. \nare  poorer  have  other  funds  by  which  this  30¢  per  pupil \ncan be  made  up. \nllluc7/Cs. \n7.

From \nthis  and  other  evidence  the  following  facts  are  apparent: \n• \n1)  The  Rural  Schools  Are  Largely  Desegregated. \nOf  the  32,000  rural children  of  all  twelve  grades,  some \n23,000,  black  and  white,  afe  being  hauled  by  bus  to \ndesegregated  schools.  No  rural  schools  are  all-black. \nThe only all-white  county  schools  arc  four  new  schools \nin  the  south  and  east  portions  of  the  county:  Beverly \nWoods,  Devonshire,  Idlewild  auel  Lansdowne. \n2)  The  City  Schools  a re  Still  LfiTgely  Segregated. \n% \nA  few  city  schools,  Elizabeth  (58  Negro);  Highland \n(13%  Negl'o);  Plaza  Road  (19%  Negro);  Randolph \n(28%  Negro);  Sedgefield  (197'0  Negro);  Spaugh \n(18%  Negro)  and  Harding  Negro)  have  a  sub \n(1770 \nstantial  degree  of  apparently  stabilized  desegregation. \nHowever,  most  of  the  ful1y  desegregated  city  schools \nare  not  stable  in  that  situation,  but  are  rapidly  mov \ning  (through  a  temporary desegregation)  from  an  all \nwhite  to  an  all-black condition.

None  was  as  familiar  with  the  local  situation  as \nthe  local  Board and  school  administrators. All drcw certain \nconclusions  from  t.he  Coleman  Report,  which  is  a  collection \nof  statistics  on  performance  of  school  children  in  certain \nareas  about  the  country.  Some  said  that  kindergarten  for \nall  children  would  help  the  situation.  Some  said  under \nprivileged  children  should  start  getting  public  education \nseveral  years  before  first  grade  age.  Some  said  t.hat  im \nproving  the  faculty  was  important.  Available  statistics \nand  expcl't.  opinion  agreed  that  Negro  students  as  a  group \ndo  noticeably  worse  on  achievemc11t  tests  than  students \n• \ngenerally.  The  experts  agreed  that  if  children  are  under-\nprivileged and undercllltured,  their school  performance  will \nbe  generally  low.

The Ahraham  Lillcoln-Charles  Ket \nof \ntering  theory  tho  rise  of  Americans  from  poor  back \ngrounds  received  small  support. \nOne point on  which  the  experts  all  ag-ree  (and  the  stat.is-\n-\ntics  tend  to  hea  them  out.)  is  that  a  rHcial  mix  in  which \nI' \nhlack  students  heavily  predominate  tends  to  retard  t.he \nprogt'ess  of  the  whole  group,  whereas  if  st.udents  arc \nmingled  with  a  clear  white  majority,  such  as  a  70/30  ratio \n(approximately  the  rutio  of  white  to  black  students  in \ni\\fecklcllburg  County),  the  better  students  can  hold  their \npace,  with  suhstant.ial  improvcmcnt for  the  poorer student.s. \nSchool\"  Theory. \nc)  The  \"Neighborboorl  Recently,  the \nSchool  Board  has  followed  what  it.  calls  the  \"neighborhood \nschool\" theory.  E-fforts have heen made to locate elementary \n•  • \nschools  il1  l1eighhorhoods,  wit.hin  walkil1g  distance  of  chil-\ndren.  theon' has  been  ci ted  to  account for  location  and \n~rhc \n• \npopulation  of junior and  :seniol'  high schools  al:so. \n\"Neigh borhood\"  in  Oha rlotte  tends  to  be  a  gron p  of \nhome:s  generally  Rimilar  in  race  and  income.  Location  of \nschool!-;  in  Ohalotte  bas  followed  the  local  pattern  of  re8i \nde  facto \ndentia I  development,  including  its  patterns  of \nsegregation.  ,Vi th  n  few  significant  exceptions,  SHch  as \n% \nOlympic  High  School  (abont  black)  and  Randolph  Road \n.Junior  High  School  (28%  black),  the  schools  which  have \nbeen  built  recently  have  he en  black  or  almost  completely \nblack,  or  white  or  almost  completely  white,  and  this  proha \nhilit.y  was  apparent  and  predictahle  when  the  schools  were \nbuilt.  Specific  instances  include  Albemarle  Road  Elemen \nWoods  (100% \ntary  (99%+  white)  ;  Beverly  white);  Bruns \nAvenue  hlack)  ; Hidden Valley  (100%  white);  OIela \n(99~1o+ \nProvidence  (98%  white);  -Westerly  Hills  (100+  white); \nAlbemarle  Road  .Tunior  High  (93%  white). \n\n22a \nOpinion and Order  Da,ted  April  Ef.c. \n23, 1969, \nToday  people  drive  as  much  as  forty  or  fifty  miles  to \nwork;  five  ten  miles  to church;  several  hours  to  foothall \n01' \ngames; all over the county for civic affairs  of various  types. \n, \nThe  automobile  has  exploded  the  old-fashioned  neighbor-\nhood.  Parents  with  children  of  all  ages  may  be  members \nof  two  or  three  separate  and  widely  scattered  school  \"com \nmunities.\"  Puttin.g  a,  .'ichool  in  a  partic1dnr  location  is  the \nactive  force  which  creates  a  temporary  of  in \ncotnmm~ity \nterest  among  those  who  at  the  momen·t  have  ohildren  in \nschool.  The  parents'  community  with  the  school  ordi \nthat \nnarily  cnds  the  day  the  youngest  child  graduates. \nI f  this  court  were  writing  the  philosophy  of  education, \nhe  would  suggest  that  educators  should  concentrate  on \nplanning  schools  as  educational  institutions  rather  than  as \nneighborhood  proprietorships.  The  neighborhood  school \nconcept  may  well  be  invalid  for  school  administrative  pur \nposes  even  without  regard  for  racial  problems.  The  Char \nlotte-Mecklenburg  Sehool  Board  today,  for  example,  is \ntransporting 23,000 students on  school  buses.  First graders \nmay  be  the  largest  group  transported.  I f  a  first  grader \n80 \nlives  far  enough  from  school  to  ride  a  bus,  the  school  is \nnot  part  of  his  neighborhood. \nWhen  racial  segregation  was  required  by  law,  nobody \nevoked  the  neighhorhood  school  theory  to  permit  blaek \nchildren  to  attend  white  schools  close  to  where  they  lived. \nThe  values  of  the  theory  somehow  were  not  recognized \nhefore 1965.  I t  was  repudiated  by  the  1955  North  Carolina \nGener'ul  Assembly  and  still  stands  repudiated  in  the  Pupil \nAssigllment  Act  of  1955-56,  which  is  quoted  above.  The \nneighborhood  school  theory  has  no  standing  to  override \nthe  Constitution. \nd)  Bussing.  Under  North  Carolina  General  Statutes, \n§115-180,  the  Board  is  expressly  authorized  to  operate \n\n- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n23a \nOpinio·i/.  nnd Order  Dated April  Etc. \n23. 1969, \nschool  busses  to  transport  school  children.  The  state  pays \nhus  expenses only for  rural children and  for some  who  have \nheen  annexed  into  the  city  in  recent  years.  This  apparent \ndiscrimination  against  city  dwellers  is  reportedly  under \nattack  in  another  court.  This  Board  already  transports \n23,000  students  to  school  evcry  day  out  of  the  32,000  who \nlive  in  the  area  presently  eligible  for  bus  service.  The \nprcsent cost of school bussing is about $19  for hus operation \nplus  the  cost  of  the  bus  which  at  $4,500  per  bus  should  not \nexceed  $20  per  pupil  a  yeaI'.  In  other words,  it  costs  about \n$40  a  year  per  pupil  to  provide  school  hus  transportation, \nout  of  total  pCI'  pupil  school  opcrating  costs  of  about  $540. \nThe  income  of  many  hlack  families  is  so  low  they  are  not \nable  to  pay for  the  cost of transportation  out of  segregated \nschools  to  other  schools  of  their choice. \nThe  Board  has  the  power  to  use  school  buses  for  all \nlegitimate  school  purposes.  Buses  for  mallY  years  were \nused  to  operate  segregnted  schools.  Thcl'c  is  no  reason \nexcept emotion  (and  I  confess  to  having  felt  my  own  share \nof  emotion  on  this  subject  in  all  the  years  before  I  studied \nthe  facts)  why  school  busses  cannot  be  used  by  the  Board \nto  provide  the  flexibility  and  economy  necessary  to  de \nsegregate  the  schools.  Busses  are  cheaper  than  new  build \nings;  using  them  might  even  keep  property  taxes  down. \ne )  Faculty  Desegregation,.  The  Board  employs  over \n2,600  white  teachers  and  OVel'  900  black  teachers.  New \nteachers  hired  last  year  numbered  700.  Technically  their \n• \ncontracts  are  with  the  Board  of  :Education  to  teach  where \nassigned.  The  Board makes  no  sustained  effort  to  desegre \ngatc  faculties.  The  choice  where  to  teach  is  a  matter  be \ntween the principal and  the prospective teacher.  The  Board \nassumes  white  teachers  will  tend  to  choose  white  schools \nand  black  teachers  black  schools.  . \n\n24a \nOpi'l1iO'1!  and  Order  Dated  April  Etc. \n23, 1%9, \nThe  results  of  this  passi ve  selection  policy  are  ohvious. \nOf tho  thirteen  aU-black  schools  in  the  system serving \n8,840 \nstudents,  only  font'  have  any  white  Those  four \nteachel'~. \nhave  tell  white  teachers  and  161  black  teachers  for  3,662 \nstudents.  Few  predominantly  black  schools  have  any  sub \nstantial  number  of  white  teacherH,  except  a  few  schools \nwhich  serve  areas  rapidly  from  white  to  black. \ntUl\"lling \nEight  other  schools  99%  or  more  black  had  only  six  white \nteachers  among  them  5,246  black  and  24  white  pupils. \nfOI' \nSecond  'Vard  and West  Chadotta High  Schools,  with  2,700 \nhlack  students  and  three  white  students,  have  131  hlack \nteachers  and  only  nine  white  teachers. \nAll  of  the  white  elementary  schools  have  at  least  one \nand  in  a  few  cases  as  many as  three  or four  black  teachers. \nThe  pr'opol'tions  of  black  teachers  in  the  junior  and  senior \nhigh  schools  run  slightly  higher.  The  system  has  not \noperated,  however,  to  produce  any  substantial  teaching  of \nblack  students  by  white  teachers. \nDcsegTegation  of  faculties  does  not  depend  upon  proof \nof  superiority  of  one  group  of  teachers  or  students  over \nthe  other.  Whatever  the  discrimination  that  may  result \nfrom  a  segregated  faculty,  it  will  be  eliminated  only  when \na  child  attending  any  school  in  the  system  will  face  about \nthe  same  chances  of  having  a  black  or  a  wbite  teacher  as \nhe  would  in  any  other  school.  Mecklenburg  schools  pay  a \nsizeable  salary  supplement.  Desegregation  is  proceeding \nIt \nin  other  counties  and  sehool  districts.  can  not  be  as \nsumed  and  should  not  be  a  tacit  part  of  Board  policy  that \nwhite  school  teachers  arc  opposed  to  equality  of  educa \ntion  or  that  they  will  refuse  to  teach  in  black  schools.  In \nfact,  white  and  black  teachers  are  working  tog-ethel\"  in \nsubstantial  numbers  in  sevp,ral  of  this  8ystem  and \nschool~ \nthere  was  no  evidence  at  the  hearing  of  any  friction  or \n• \n\n25a \nOrder  Du.tcd  April  Etc. \nOpi'lIio'lI  alld  23, 1.%9, \ndifficulty  caused  by  a  bi-racial  faculty.

The \nright  of  all  children  to  equal  education  is  part  of  that \nIt \nright.  is  Iwlievecl  that  if  the  Board  takes  a  stand  that \nrequires  faculty  dosegrogation  and  treats  all  teachers \nequally  in  wOl'king  tow[lI'ds  that  end,  the  teaehers  will \nparticipate  wholehea.rtedly. \nf)  Metropolita\"n  High  School.  Supported  by  impressive \nrccommCllClatiollR  from  Engelhart,  Engelhart  &  Leggett, \neducational  consultants,  the  Board  has  planned  and  has \ntwo  million  dol aI's  on  hand  to  build  .M.dropolitan  High \nSchool  at  or  noar  the  location  of  present  Second  \",Yard \nHigh  School.

Second  Ward  is  now  a \n99%+ \nblack  school  in  the  Brooklyn  urban  renewal  area \nfour  or  five  blocks  south of the  Court House  and  City  Hall. \nThe  First Bapt.ist  Church  and  tbe  School  Board  itself have \nbuildillgS  under  way  adjacent  or  nearby  land.  This  is \nall \nncar  the  geographical  and  tt'aflic  center  of  the  city  and \ncounty,  one-balf  a  mile  from  t.ho  central  business  district, \na  few  blocks  from  Central  Piedmont  Community  College \nand  within  easy  travel  distance  of  most.  of  the  city.  The \nlocation  and  proposed  purposes  appear  ideal. \nPlaintiffs' attorneys  object  to  :;'\\ietropolitan  Higb  School. \nSome  Pl'CSCllt  school  patrons  want  the  school  built.

That  assumption  should  no  longer  be  entertained. \nPupils  for  regular  and  vocational  subjects  can  travel  or \nbe \ntransported to  and  from this  area,  in  all  directions,  with \ngreater  ease  than  is  true  of  any  other  location  in  the \ncounty.  The  nearest  other  high  schools,  Harding,  West \nCharlotte,  Garinger,  East  and  Myers  Park,  form  a  hollow \npentagon  six  or  seven  miles  on  the  side  surrounding  Sec \nond  Ward.  It would  be  tragic  to  refrain  from  building  a \nneeded  educational  facilit.y  simply  upon  the  assumption \nthat  it  has  to  be  an  all-black  school  and  therefore  either \nunlawful  or  unattractive.  The  School  Board  is  advised  to \nmake  plans  for  desegregation  of  this  school  along  with \nother  schools  in  the  system.  ·With  the  unrestricted  statu \ntory  power  to  assign  pupils  and  provide  transportation, \nthe only thing necessary  to  build  Metropolitan  High School \naccording  to  the  dreams  of  its  planners  is  the  decision \nto  do  so. \ng)  The  Percentage  Racial  Mix.  Counsel  for  the  plain \ntiffs  says  that  since  the  ratio  of  white  to  black  students \nis  about 70/30,  the  School  Board should  assign  the children \n3070 \non  a  basis  70%  white  and  black,  and  bus  them  to  all \nthe  schools.  This court  does  not  feel  that it has  the  power \nto  make  such  a  specific  order.  Nevertheless,  the  Board \ndoes  have  the  power  to  establish  a  formula  and  provide \ntransportation  and  if  this  could  be  done,  it  would  be  a \ni \nIt \ngreat benefit  to  the commnnity.  would  tend  to  eliminate \nshopping  around  for  schools;  all  the  schools,  in  the  New \nKent  County  language,  would  be  \"just  schools\";  it  would \nmake  all  schools  equally  \"desirable\"  or  \"undesirable\"  de-\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n-\n27a \nOpini.on  and  Order  Dated April  Etc. \n23, 1969, \npending  on  the  point  of  vie?';  it  would  equalize  the  bene \nfits  and  burdens  of  desegregation  over  the  whole  county \ninstead  of  leaving  them  resting  largely  upon  the  people \nof  the  northern,  western  and  l-louthwestel'n  parts  of  the \ncounty;  it  would  get  the  Board  out  of  the  business  of  law \nsuits  and  rcal  estate  zoning  and  leave  it  in  the  education \nbusiness;  and  it  would  be  a  tremendous  step  toward  the \nstability  of  real  estate  values  in  the  community  and  the \nprogress  of education  of  children.  Though  seemingly  radi \ncal  in  nature,  jf  viewed  by  people  who  live  in  totally \nsegregated  neighborhoods,  it  ma.y  like  surgery  be  the  most \nconseI'\\'ative  solution  to  the  whole  problem  and  the  one \nmost  likely  to  produce  good  education  for  all  at  minimum \ncost.  It would  simply  put  the  all-white  and  all-black  school \npeople  in  the  same  school  situation  now  being  experienced \nby  patrons  of  Cornelius,  Davidson,  Ranson,  Long  Creek, \nDilworth,  Olympic,  Huntersville,  Pineville,  Randolph  Road \nJunior  High,  Statesville  Road,  and  similar  schools.  Such \nactiol!  would  be  supported  by  the  unanimous  testimony  of \nall  the  experts  and  by  inferences  from  the  Coleman  Report \nthat  although  mixing  a  few  whites  Ulld  a  heavy  majority \nof  blacks  retards  the  whole  group,  nevertheless  mixing  a \nsubstantial  'majority  of  whites  and  a  few  blacks  helps  the \nblacks  to  advance  without  retarding  the  whites. \nh)  A  Word  Abou.t  the  School  Board.'\"  The  observations \nin  this  opinion  arc  not  intended  to  reBect  upon  the  motives \nor  the  judgment of  the  School  Board  members.  They  have \noperated  for  four  years  under  a  court  order  which  re \nBected  the  general  understanding  of  1965  about  the  law \nregarding  desegregation.  They  have  achieved  a  degree \nand  volume  of  desegregation  of  schools  apparently  un \nsurpassed  in  these  parts,  and  have  exceeded  the  perfor \nmance  of  any  school  board  whose  actions  have  been  1'e-\n\n28a \nOpi'nion  and  Order  Dated  AP1'il  Etc. \n23, 1969, \nviewed  in  appellate  court  decisions.  The  Charlotte \n:i\\{ecklenburg  schools  in  many  respects  are  models  for \nothers.  They  are  attractive  to  outside  teachers  and  offer \ngood  education.  The  problem  before  this  court  is  only \none  part  (albeit  a  major  part)  of  the  educational  problem. \nThe  purpose  of  this  court  is  not  to  criticize  the  School \nBoard,  but  to  lny  down  somp.  legal  standards  by  which \nthc  Board  can  deal  further  with  a  most  complex  and \ndifficult  problem.  The  difference  hctwcrn  1965  and  1969 \nis  simply  the  differencc  between  Brown  of  1955  and  Green \nv.  New  Kent  CO'I.tnt,y  of  19G8.  Tho  rules  of  the  game  have \nchang-ed,  and  the  methods  and  philosophies  which  in  good \nfaith  the  Board  has  followed  are  no  longer  adequate  to \ncomplete  t.he  job  which  the  court.s  now  say  mllst  be  done \n\"now.\" \nCONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW \n1.  Since  1965,  tho  law  has  moved  from  an  attitude \nbarring  discrimination  to  an  attitude  requiring  active \ndesegregation.  The  actions  of  school  Boards  and  district \ncourts  must  now  be  judged  under  Green  v.  New  Kent. \nCounty  rather  than  under  the  milder  lash  of  Brown  v. \nBoard.  of  Ed'ucation.  The  court  has  outlined  changes \nwhich  should  he  made  in  the  activity  and  theory  of  the \nlocal  Board. \n2.  The  manner  in  which  the  Board  has  located  schools \nand  operated  the  pupil  assignment  system  has  continued \nand  in  some  situations  accentuated  patternA  of  racial \nsegregation  in  housing,  school  attendance  and  community \ndevelopment.  The  Board  did  not originate  those  patterns; \nhowever,  now  is  the  time  to  stop  acquiescing  in  those \npatterns. \n\n29a \nOpinion  and  Orde1'  Dated  April  Etc. \n23, 1969, \n3.  Freedom  of  transfer  as  operated  in  this  system  does \nnot  answer  the  problems  of  nwial  segTegation.  The  evi \ndence  shows  that  the  black  students  as  n  group  have  very \nlow  incomes.  Freedom  of  transfer  without  transportation \nis  to  such  a  student  often  an  empty  right. \n4.  The  faculties  have  not  been  adequntely  desegregated \nas  directed.  This  permits  and  promotes  ineqnality  of \neducation. \n5.  The  court  does  ]lot  find  any  inequality  based  upon \nracial  motives  or  reasons  in  the  use  of  federal  funds;  the \nuse  of  mobile  classrooms;  quality  of  school  buildings  and \nfacilities  athletics  PTA  acti vitics;  school  fees;  free \nj  j \nlunches  books;  elective  courses;  nor  in  individual  evalua \nj \ntion  of  students.  The  problem  (If  alleged  gerrymandering \nof  district  lines  Ileed  not  be  covered  separately  from  the \ngene  1  order  hnreill  made. \nI'll \n6.  There  has  been  substantial  desegTegation  in  many \nareas  mostly  the  rural  areas  of  this  large  and \nCOTll \nplicated  school  system.  A  lI1ajori ty  of  t.he  black  students, \nhowever,  still  attend  segreg-ated  schools  and  seldom,  if \never,  see  a  white  fellow  student.  :Many  all-black  and  a11-\nwhite  schools  still  remain.  The  neighborhood  school  con \ncept and  freedom  of choice as administered  are  not flll'ther \ning  desegregation. \n7.  The  School  Board  has  an  affirmative  duty  to  promote \nfaculty  desegregation  and  desegregation  of  pupils,  and  to \ndeal  with  the  problem  of  the  all-black  schools. \n8.  The  School  Board  is  free  and  encouraged  to  use \nschool  busses  or  other  public  transportation  and  to  use \n\n30a \nOpinion  and Order Dated  April  Etc. \n23, 19G9, \nmobile  classrooms  as  needed  to  provide  equality  of  educa \nt.ional  opportunity. \n9.  The  Board  has  assets  and  experience  beyond  thc \nreach  of  a  judge  to  deal  with  all  these  problems,  and \nshould  be  requested  to  formulate  a  plan  and  time  table \nof  positive  action. \nORDER \n1.  All  findings  or  statements  of  fact  in  this  opinion  and \norder  shall  be  deemed  conclusions  of  law,  and  all  conclu \nsions  of  law  shall  be  deemed  to  be  finuings  of  fact  as \nnecessary  in  support  and  furtherance  of  this  order.  All \ncompetent  and  relevant  evidence  in  the  record  has  been \nconsidered  in  support  of  this  order. \n2.  The  defendant  is  directed  to  submit  by  May  15,  1969, \na  plan  for  the  active  and  complete  desegregation  of  teach \ners  in  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  school  system,  to  be \neffective  with  the  1969-70  school  year.  Such  plan  could \napproach  substantial  eqnality  of  teaching  in  all  schools  by \nseeking  to  apportion  teachers  to  each  school  on  substan \ntially  the  same  ratio  (about  three  to  one)  as  the  ratio  of \nwhite  teachers  and  black  teachers  in  the  system  at  large. \nIt \nis  suggested  that  teachers'  preferences  not  be  especially \nsought  and  that  teachers  be  assigned  as  a  routine  matter \nfor  the  purpose  of  accomplishing  this  equalization  of  the \napplication  of  educational  manpower  and  womanpower  in \nthe  public  schools.  Such  a  plan  should  provide  safeguards \nagainst  racial  discrimination  in  the  discharge  of  any \nteachers  whose  jobs  might  be  changed  or  abolished.  Such \nsafeguards  should  include  provisions  that  if  anyone  has \nto  be  discharged,  his  qualifications  will  be  weighed  against \n\n31a \nOpinion  Order  Dated  April  Etc. \nmId  23,  1969, \nthose  of  a11  personnel  in  the  system  rather  than  simply \nagainst those in  the  capacity in  which  he  has  been  working; \nno  teacher  should  be  dismissed  or  demoted  or  denied  em \nployment  or  promotion  because  of  race  or  color.  In  other \nwords,  the  Board will  be  expected  to  see  to  it  that  teachers \ndisplaced  by  virtue  of  this  order  will  not  be  discriminated \nagainst  on  account  of \nraCG. \n3.  The  defendant  is  directed  to  submit  by  May  15,  1969, \na  plan  and  a  time  table  for  the  active  desegregation  of  the \npupils,  to  be  predominantly  effective  in  the  fall  of  1969 \nHnd  to  be  completed  by  t.he  fall  of 1970.  Freedom  of  choice \nand  zoning  may  be  used  ill  such  a  plan  provided  they \npromote  rather  than  defeat  desegregation.  I f   freedom \nof  choice  is  retained  in  such  plan,  it  should  include  pro \nvision  for  transportation free  for  any  student who  requests \ntransfer  out  of  a  school  where  his  race  is  in  the  majority, \nand  to  any  school  where  his  race  is  in  the  minority,  and \na  means  of  insuring- that  all  students  have  full  and  timely \nknowledge  of  the  availability  of  such  transportation. \n4.  In  formulating  its  plan  the  Board  is,  of  course,  free \nto  use  all  of  its  own  resources  and  any  or  all  of  the \nnumerous  methods  which  have  been  advanced,  including \npairing  of  grades  and  of  schools;  feeding  elementary  into \njunior  high  and  into  senior  high;  combinations  of  zone \nand  free  choice  where  each  method  proceeds  logically \ntowards  eliminating  segregatioll;  and  bussing  or  other \ntransportation.  The  Board  may  also  consider  setting  up \nlarger consolidated  school  units  freely  crossing  city-county \nJines  to  serve  larger  areas.  There  is  no  magic  in  existing \nschool  zone  .Jines  nor  in  the  present  size  of  any  school. \nThe  Board  is  encouraged  to  get  such  aid  as  may  be  avail \nable  from  state  and  federal  agencies  including  the  offices \n\n32a \nand  Order  Dated  April  Etc. \n23, 196.9, \nOpi't~ion \nof  the  Department  of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare. \nThe  court  does  not  direct  a  treaty  with  the  Department, \nbut  does  suggest  that  since  its  employees  are  in  the  busi \nness  of  dealing  with  these  problems,  they  have  a  store \nof  technical  assets  and  manpower  and  information  which \ncould  be  useful  in  the  Board's  making  any  particular \njudgment  or  analysis. \n5.  The  plan  should  be  the  plan  of  the  Board  for  the \neffective  operation  of  the  schools  in  a  desegregated  at \nmosphere,  removed  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  from \nentanglement  with  emotions,  neighborhood  problems,  real \nestate  values  and  pride.  The  court's  task  has  not  been \neasy,  but  it  is  fully  realized  that the  task facing  the  Board \nis  far  more  difficult  and  will  require  a  conspicuous  degree \nof  further  public  service  by  the  Board's  members. \nThis  the  23rd  day  of  April,  1969. \nl s i  \nB. \nJAMES  McMU,T,A.N \nJames  B.

Also, \nwhy  the  defendants  should  not  retain  any  land  or  control \nover  any  land  they  may  now  have,  pending  such  decision. \n13.

The  court  is  not  interested  in  a  restate \nment  of  the  previous  demand  of  plaintiffs  that  all  the \nschools in  the  syst.em  be  populated  a  70/30 basis, because \n011 \nas  previously  stated  the  court  does  not  have  the  power  to \nmake  such  an  order  and  the  defendants  have  served  notice \nthat they will  not. undertake  such  assignment themselves. \n~H1 \nWhat  is  desired  is  some  tough  and  detailed  thinking  and \nplanning  as  to  detailed  methods  to  reduce  and  promptly \neliminate  segregation  in  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools. \nThe  above  questions  and  requests,  insofar  as  they  call \nfor  facts  and  figures,  call  for  the  production  not  the  crea \ntion  of  the  desired  informatioll.

This  is  a  suit \nunder  the  Civil  Rights  Act  involving  questions  of  equal \nprotection  of  laws  and  racial  discrimination  and  segre \ngation  in  t.he  public  schools.  The  individual  defendants  are \nproper  parties  and  their  presence  is  appropriate  and \ndesirable. \nn. \nTHE MOTION  FOR A  CONTEMPT CITATIO}l. \nThe  motion  of  the  plaintiffs  that  the  individual  defend \nants  be  found  in  contempt  of  the  court  is  on  this  record \ndenied.  The  board  is  badly  divided  and  many  of  its  recent \ndecisions appear to be made by a  five  to four vote.  Supreme \nCourt  judges  now  and  then  make  five  to  four  decisions. \n(Fortunat.ely  their  votes  in  all  major  school  segregation \ncases  appear  t.o  have  been  unanimous.)  The  members  of \n\n47a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  20,  1969 \nJ~I.ne \nthe  board  have  had  uncomplimentary  things  to  say  about \neach  other and about the cOllrt,  and  many of them  obviously \ntlisagree  with  t.he  legality  and  propriety  of  the  oreler  of \nthe  court;  but  these  laLter  sentiments  Illay  be  regarded  by \nthe  court  as  evidence  of  disagreement  witb  rathel'  than \ncontempt fol'  the court  who  is  himself  not far  removed  from \nactive  participation  in  the  time-honored  custom  of criticiz \ning  a  j nelge  bas  ruled  against  him.  Moreover,  on  an \nW110 \nissue  of  such  significa.nce,  the  amount  of  foot-dragging \nwhich  has  taken  place,  up  to  at  least,  should  not  he \nlIOW \nconsidered  as contempt of court.. \nIII. \nTHE  PLAN'  OF  THE  DEFENDANTS. \n1.  The  history  of  the  pll/n . .. ·The  order  of  this  court  di \nrecting  a  further  plan  for  desegregation  was  entered  April \n23,  Hi69.  'Vithin  hours,  various  of  the  defendants  ex \npressed  sharp  views  pro  and  con.  The  board  met  on  April \n28,  1969,  and  for  the  first  t.ime  bdetly  disc.llssed  t.he  order. \nBy \na  five  to  f01ll'  margin,  apparently,  they  decided  in \nformally  not  to  t.ry  to  appeal  immecliately,  upon  the  basis \nthat  the  right  of  appeal  from  the  order  to  prepare  a  plan \nwas  doubtful.  The  school. superintendent was  instructed  to \nprepare  a  desegregation  plan.  No  express  guidelines  were \ngiven  the  superintendent.  However,  the  views  of  many \nmembers  expressed  at  the  meeting  wet'e  so  opposed  to  seri \nons  and  suhstantial  desegregation  that  everyone  including \nthe  superintendent could  reasonably  have concluded,  as  the \ncourt does,  that  a.  \"minimal\"  pIau  was  what  was  called  for, \nand  that  the  \"plan\"  was  essentially  a  prelude  to  antici \nIn \npa.ted  disapproval  and  appeal.  a  county  and  city  criss-\n\n48a \nOpinion  an(l  Order  dated  J-wnc. \n20,1969 \ncrossed  by  school  hn:;  routes  for  23,000  pupils,  more  than \ntwenty  thousand  citizens,  mostly  from  affluent  suburbia, \nmany of  whose  children  undoubtedly  go  to  school  school \n011 \nbusses,  signed  pctitio11S  against  \"involuntary\"  bussing  of \nstudents.  The  fl'cnzy  of  parents  received  a  ready  formYl \nin  televised  meetings  of  the  board.  The  staff  were  never \ndirected  to  do  I'erious  work  on  re-drawiIlg  of  school \nallY \nzone  lines,  pairing  of  schools,  combining  zones,  grouping \nof  schools,  confere11ces  with  the  Depal'tmCllt  of  Health, \nEducation  and  \\Velfnre,  nor  any  of  the  other  possihle \nl11etllOds  of mah.-ing  real progress towards  desegregation. \nThe  superintendent  revealed  tbe  general  tenus  of  his \nplan  within  a  few  <.]::IYs  and  later  presented  it  formally  on \n\"May  S,  1969.  It  provided  for  full  faculty  desegregation  in \n1969,  which  the  superi.ntendent  said  he  considered  feasible. \nIt  provided  moderate  changes  in  the  pupil  assignment \nplans;  anu  it  contemplated  future  study  of  the  other \nmethods  (If  desegregation  suggested  in  the  April  23,  1969 \norder. \nThe  board  then  met,  struck  out  virtually  all  the  effective \nprovisions of  the  plan,  and  asked  for more \n~mperint.elldent.'s \ntime  from  the  court,  which  had  pl'eviously  been  promised. \nThe  boarel's  committee  on  buildings  and  sites,  newly  re \nconsti tutcd, met and voted  to  cancel  the long standing  plans \nfor  Metropolitau  High  School,  and  voted  to  build  it  as  only \na  specialty and  vocational school  without including the com \nprehensive  high  school  which  consultants  and  experts,  in \ncluding  the  school  board's  staff  and  superintendent,  had \nrecommended  and  still recommend.  No new  facts  except the \norder  of  court  had  developed  to  account  for  the  sudden \ncbange of plan.  The stated reason for  the change was that a \ngeneral  high  school  in  Second  Ward  (though  not  a  voca \ntional  or  technical  school)  would  necessarily  be  black  and \n\n49a. \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  .hate \n20 ..  1969 \ntherefore  should  not  be  built.  [The  Second  -Ward  school \nsite, where Metropolitan is  scheduled  to be  built,  is  squarely \nin  the  center  of  the  city's  population;  is  a  scant four  blocks \nfrom  the  south  boundary  of  its  zone;  and  is  apparently the \neasiest  high  school  in  town  to  desegregate;  its  boundaries \ncould  easily be  re-drawn by extending its southern boundary \n(Morehead  Street)  and  its  eastel'll  bonnda ry  (Queens \nHond)  a  few  blocks.] \nThereaftor,  on  :l\\fay  28,  1969,  the  plan  was  filed.  Volun \nteers  were  requested  alJlong  tbn  teachers;  pupil  t.ransfer \nrequest,s  were  set  ont;  and  data  on  the  workings  of  the \nplan  began  to  accumulate. \nDurillg  the  early  dehate  over  the  COllrt  order,  events \ntranspired  between  tbe  chairman  and  the  superil1tendent \nwhich  were  thought  by  an  assist.ant  snperintendent  and \nothers  to  threaten  the  snperintendent's  job  if  be  pus bed \nfo),  compliance  with  tue  court's  order.  A  few  clays  before \nhearing,  the  board  committee  011  plll\"sol1nol  declined \nthi~ \nto  accept  tbe  supcrilltcndent's  recommendatioll  that  Robert \nDavis, a  Negro,  be appoillted  principal of one of the schools. \nThis  \\Vas  the  flJ'st  time  a  recommendation  bad  not \nSllCU \nbeen  accepted.  Aftel'  some  debate,  the  decision  was  post \nponed,  with  the  superintendent  reqnested  to  bring  in  al \ntel'Jlat,e  names.  The  publicly  stated  reasons  for  not.  approv \ning  the  appointment  were  that  Davis,  whose  training,  ex \nperience  and  qualiflcatiolls  were  unquestioned,  is  a  plllintiff \nin  this case and  a  member of the  Negro  Classroom  Teachers \nAssociation  and  has  spoken  ont publicly  in  favor  of compli \nancc  wtll  this  court's  order  ·including  onc  television  ap \npCflrance  before  the  bonrd  it.self  to  which  thc  board  had \ninvited  interested  citizens.  Davis,  according  to  tbe  press, \nwas  eventually  confirllled  the  job  on  June  19,  1969, \nfOI' \n. \n. \nbut  onl \\'  after  a  \"Ioyaltv  oa.th\"  had  heen  exacted.

The  June  hearing.  -The  defendants,  under \n16,  1969 \nthe  law,  had  the  burden  of  showing  that  their  plan  would \ndesegregate  the  se-hools.  To  carry  that  hurden  they  intro \nduced  a  short  written  brief  and  some  statistical  data  and \nrested  their  case  without  live  testimony.  The  plaintiffs \ncalled  all  members  of  the  school  board  and  the  Rhode \nIsland  expert,  Dr.  Finger,  who  testified  at  the  March  hear \ning,  and  a  few  other  witnesses.  There  was  some  rebuttal \nfrom  the  board. \n3.  Findings  a.s  to  General  Board  Policy.  -\na)  The  board  does  not  admit  nor  claim  that  it  has \nany  positive  duty  to  promote  desegregation. \nb)  School  sites  and  school  improvements  have  not \nbeen  selected  nor  planned  to  promote  desegregation \nand  the  hoard  admits  no  such  duty. \nc)  Board  policy  is  that  the  Constitution  is  satisfied \nwhen  they  locate  schools  where  children  are  and  pro \nvide  \"freedom  of  transfer\"  for  those  who  want  to \nchange  schools. \nd)  Despite  inclusion  in  the  \"Plan,\"  the  decision \nit~ \nof  the  board  about  Metropolitan  High  School  is  not \nreally  a  final  one;  several  members  consider  the  issue \nin  doubt,  and  the  full  board  has  not  formally  con \nit. \nsidered \n\n51a \nOpinioll  aml  Order  dated  J'lIne  20,  1969 \n4.  The  Pllpi,l  Assig1ln'lent  Plan.  The  plan  now  proposed \nis  the  plan  previously  found  racially  discriminatory,  with \nthe  addition  of  olle  element  the  provision  of  transporta \ntion  for  children  electing  to  transfer  out  of  ScllOOls  where \ntheir  I'aces  are  in  a  majority  to  schools  where  they  will  be \nin  a minority.  Such p\"ovision  01'  transportation  is  approved. \nAnotber  provisioll  of the  plan  makes  high  school  athletes \nwho  transfer  from  one  school  to  another  ineligible  for \nvarsity  or  junior  varsity  athletics  until  they  have  been  a \nyear  in  the  new  school.  For  the  current  year,  with  the  re \nturns  almost  complete,  only  two  white  students  out  of \nsome  59,000  have  elected  to  transfer  from  wbi te  schools \nto  black  schools.  Some  330  hlack  students  out  of  some \n24,000  have  clect.ed  to  transfer  to  white  schools.  Only \nthe  tiniest handful  of  wbite  students  have ever  in  any  year \n.  asked  to  transfer to  black schools.  effect of the  athletic \n~rhe \npenaHy  is  obvious  it  discriminates  against  black  students \nwho  may want to  transfer and  take  part in  sports,  and is  no \npenalty  on  whitc  students  who  show  no  desire  for  such \ntransfers.  The  defendants'  superintendent  considers  ath \nletics  an  important  feature  of  education.  This  penalty \nprovision  is  racially  discriminatory.  The  board  is  directed \nto  enforce  it  any  more  and  to  give  adequate  individual \n110t \nJlOtice  to  all  rising  10th,  11th  and  12th  grade  students  that \nthey  may  )'econsider  their  previous  choice  of  scbools  in \n• \nlight  of  the  removal  of  the  penalty. \nFreedom  of  transfer  increases  rather  than  decreases \nsegregation.  The  school  superintendent  testified  that \nthere  would  be,  net,  more  than  1,200  additional  white  stu \ndents  going  to  predominantly  black  schools  if  freedom  of \ntransfer  were  abolished.  The  use  of  a  free  transfer  provi \nsion  is  a  decision  for  the  board; it may  make  desegregation \nmore  palatable to  the community  at  large;  it  is  not,  per  se, \n• \n\n52a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  Jmle \n20,  1969 \nif  the  schools  are  desegregated,  unconstitutional.  N evcr \ntheless,  desegregation  of  schuols  is  somethi.ng  tha.t  has  to \nbe  occomplishediudcpendent  of  freedom  of  tratl.sfe r .  This \nis  a  fact  which  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  statistics \nhas  only  become  clear  to  t11e  court.  since  the  previous  order \nwas  issued. \n5.  The  Faculty  Assignment  Plat!.  The  plan  originally \nproposed  by  tbe  superintendent  would  have  desegregated \nthe  faculty  as  a  routine  matter  in  19('i9.  The  plan  proposed \nby  the  board  however  is  not  materially  different  from  the \nalready  c.xisting  plan.  It  continues  to  rely  upon  voluntary \ntransfers  and  it  contemplates  affirmat.ive  assignment  of \nteachers  to  black  schools  only  late in  the  day  after  a  hope \nful  routine  of filling  vacancies  (some of which  do  not  exist) \nhas  been  followed.  The  board  has  not  taken  a  position  of \nleadership  with  the  teachers  and  the  results  are  apparent. \nOnly  28  out  of  2,·700  white  teachers,  and  only  38  out.  of  900 \nblack  teachers,  had  on  June 18,  1969  indicated a  willingness \nto  transfer  to  schools  of  the  opposite  race.  Testimony  of \nthe  board  members  who  comprise  the  majority  of the  board \nsuggests  that  they  do  not  really  contemplate  substantial \nfaculty  desegregation  and  that  they  may  consider  figures \nof  \"10ro\";  or  one  black  teacher  to  each  white  school  and \none  white  teacher  to  each  black  school;  or  filling  vacancies \nfrom  the  opposite  race  as t.hey  arise,  to  be  compliance  with \nthe  needs  of  the  situation.  None  of  these  ideas,  of  course, \namounts  to  desegregation  of the faculty.  The  evidence  sub \nmitted  by  the  board  does  not  demonstrate  that  the  faenIty \nplan  will  work.  Several  board  members  said  that  the  plan \nto  assign  teachers  is  not  an  \"idle promise.\" \nAll  that  it  takes  to  make  the  faeulty  plan  work  is  timely \ndeeision by tbe board to  implement the  assignment of teach-\n\n--\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n53a \nOpi'i'lion  and  Order  dated  .!1/.ne \n20,  1969 \ners.  Board  membel's  are  requested  in  this  connection  to \nconsidel'  the  latest  unanimons  Supreme  Court  decision, \nUnited  States  Montgomery  County  Board  of  Education \nv. \n(October  Term  HJGS) ,  Case  No,  7!)S,  decided  2,  1969, \nJU11C \nreversing the  Fifth Circuit  Court  of Appeals  and  upholding \na  dish'iet  cOllrt  oeder  for  faculty  desegregation  undel'  a \nmathematical formula. Ruling- the factulty plall will there \n011 \nfore  be  deferred  until  aftel'  A ug-ust  4,  1969,  by  which  time \nthe  hoard  is  directed  to  file  a  report.  stating  in  detail  what. \nthe  plan  has  clolle  and  what  the  status  of  faculty  assign \nments  then  is.  The  court.  considel's  the  faculty  assignment \nplan  to  be  il1lpol'tal1t  and  agrees  with  t.he  snperintendent  of \nschools  t hn t  immediate  clesegl'llga tion  of  the  faculty  is \nfeasible.  This  is  a  substantial  illlpl'O\\'ement  which  is  avail \nable  without  arousing  ghosts  of  \"bussing,\"  \"lIeighborhood \nschools,\" Or  additional  expense. \nIV. \nGERRYIII ANDEr:I1\\\"G \nThis  issue  was  passed  over  in  the  previous  opinion  upon \nthe  belief  which  the  court  st.ill  entertaills  that  the  defend \nants,  as  a  part.  of  an  overall  desegregation  plan,  will  elim \ninate  or  correct  all  school  zones  which  were  created  or \nexist  to  ellclose  black  or  white  groups  of  pupils  or  whose \npopulation  is  contl'oIled  for  purposes  of  segregatioll.  How \never,  it  may  be  timely  to  observe  and  the  conrt  finds  a \n[IS \nfact  that  no  zones  have  appareJltly  been  created  main \n0\\' \ntained  for  the  pnrposc  of  pl'ollloting  desegregation  that \nj \nschools  pupils \nthe  whole  plan  of  \"building  where  the  are\" \nwithout  fnrthCl'  control  pI'omotes  segregation;  and  that. \ncertain  schools,  fo!'  example  Billingsville,  Second  -Ward, \nAvenue  and  Amay  .James,  obviously  serve  school \nBI'lUlS \n\n54a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated \n.J1Jne  20,  1969 \nzones  which  were  either  created  or  which  have  been  con \ntrolled so  as  to  surround  pockets  of hlack  students  and that \nthe  result.  of  these  actions  is  discriminatory.  These  aro \n• \nnot  named  as  an  exclusive  list  of  such  situations,  but  as \nillustrations  of  a  long  shmding  policy  of  control  ovcr  tho \nmakeup  of  school  population  which  scarcely  fits  any  true \nschool\" \n\"neighborhood  philosophy. \no \nThe  findings  of  fact  ill  the  April  23,  1969  order  and \nall  statements  in  this  opinion  are  treated  as  findings  of \nfact  in  support of the  order.  All  of  the  evidence  in  the  case \nis  considered  in  support  of  the  order. \nORDER \nBased upon  the  evidence  and upon  the  foregoing  findings \nof  fact  the  orders  of  the  court  are  as  follows: \n1.  The  motion  of  the  individual  defendants  to  dismiss \nis  denied. \n2.  No  citations for  contempt are made. \n3.  Decision  on  the  faculty  assignment  plan  is  deferred \npending  receipt  of  a  progress  report  f!\"om  the  board  or \n011 \nbefore  August  4,  1969. \n4.  The  one  year  penalty  on  transferring  high  school \nathletes  is  disapproved  with  direction  as  above  for  appro \npriate  personal  communication  to  rising  high  school \nstudents. \n5.  The  provision  of  transport.ation  for  students  trans \nferring from a  majority to  a  minority situation  is  approved. \n\n55a \nOllin,ion  Order  dat.ed  J 1J..ne \n20, \n(l.tl,d  1969 \n6.  The  board  is  directed  to  proceed  no  further  with \naction  on  IV[etl'opolitan  High  School  pending  a  showing  by \nthe  board  that  the  school  if  constructed will  be  adequately \ndesegregated  Hnd  a  finding  by  the  court  t.o  that  effect. \nThis  is  based  upon  the  previous  fiudings  that  the  board's \ndecision  on  Metropolitan  was  unduly  affected  by  racial \nconsiderations  and  that  the  board  has  not  accepted  its \naffirmative  legal  duty  to  build  school  facilities  so  as  to \npt'omote  desegregation. \n7.  As  to  the  other  building  pl'Ojects  referred  to  in  the \nmotion  for  rostraint  on  construction,  the  hurden  remains \nupon  the  defendants  to  show  thut  these  programs  will \nproduce  desegregation.  The  written  material  t.endered  by \nthe  defendants  this  subjed  is  lengthy,  and  does  not \n011 \nappeal'  to  sustain  that  burden.  However,  decision  on  the \nrequest  for  injunction  against  projects  other  than  Metro \npolitan  will  be  delayed  pending  further  study  of  the  evi \ndence. \n8.  I t  is  further  ordered  that  the  defendants  proceed  to \nprepare  and  submit  by  August  1969,  a  positive  plall  for \n4-, \ndesegregation  of  the  pupils  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nsystem,  as  originally  directed  on  April  23,  1969. \n~chool \nA  witness,  Dr.  Finger,  described  in  detail  a  plan  for  de \nsegregation  by  changing  certain  school  zone  lines  and \nmerging  certain  schools  into  districts  and  using  certain \nschools  as  feeders  for  others.  This  plan  shows  a  high \nit \ndegree  of  realism  in  that  minimizes  the  necessit.y  for \nlong-range  transportation  and  takes  substantial  advantage \nof  location  and  makeup  of  popUlations.  Local  school  ad \nministration consider  such a  plan  feasible.

It is believed  that  if  the  resources \nof  the  board  can  be  eli rooted  as  originally  orc1el'ed  toward \npreparing  a  Charlot.te-Mecklenburg  plan  for  the  Char \nlotte-Mecklenburg  schools,  desegregation  of  both  faculties \nand  students  may  be  accomplished  in  an  onlerly  fashion. \nCounsel  are  requested  to  notify  the  court  promptly  if  morc \ntime  beyond  August 4,  1969  is  needed. \nThis  is  the  20th  day of June,  1969. \nJ  B. \nA~fES  McMILLAN \nJames  B.  McMillan \nUnited  States  District  Judge \n\n57a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  in  Connection  With  the \nOrder  of June  20,  1969  (Dated  June  24,  1969) \nThe  relatively  complete  extent  of  the  segreg-ution  of  the \nill \nschools  this  system  is  by  study  of  the  de \ndemoll~tJ\"ated \nfondants'  stat.ist.ic:,;  which  were  attached  to  and  inclmlcd \nill  tlw  original  opinion  of  this  court  of  April  23,  1960. \nThere  arc  about  24,000  black  students  in  the  county.

A  hearing  was  conducted \non  August  5,  1969.  The  plan  is  before  the  court  for  ap \nproval. \nBecause  the  schools  must  open  September  2,  and  because \nthe  Board's  plan includes  both  substantial  action  and  gen \nuine  assurance  of  sustained  effort  t.oward  prompt  compli \nance  with  the  law  of  the  land,  the  plan  of  operation,  for \n1969-70  only,  is  approved  and as  indicated below,  the defen \ndants  are  directed  to  prepare  and  file  by  November  17, \n1969,  detailed plans and  undertakings for  completion  of the \njob  of  desegregating  the  schools  effective  in  September, \n1970. \nITs \nTHE  AMENDED  PLA N  AND  RECEPTION \nThe  plan  proposes,  among  other  things,  to  close  seven \nold  all-black  inner-city  schools  and  to  assigll  their  3,000 \nstudents  to  various  outlying  schools,  now  predominantly \n·white,  mostly  in  high  rent  districts. \nThis  technique  of  school  closing  and  reassignment  has \nbeen  employed  in  dozens  of  school  districts  to  promote \nschool desegregation.  I t  is not original with the local School \nBoard. \nThe  school  closing  issue  has  provoked  strident  protests \nfrom  black  citizens  and  from  others;  evidence  showed  that \n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n-~----------\n• \n59a \nOrder  dated \nA'll.fJUst  15,  1.969 \nan  estimated  19,000  names  are listed  on  a  petition  denounc \ning the  plan  as  unfair  and  discriminatory.

Another  800  white  Paw  Creek  lJetitioners \nhave  joined  in  protest  against  a  part  of  the  plan  under \nwhich  some  200  fifth  and  sixth  grade  pupils  would  be  as \nsigned  to  re-opened Woodland, a  new  unused  (and formerly \nblack)  school.

The  Foul'teenth  A.mcll(lment  to  that \nBill \nConstitution,  part of  the  of  Rights,  guarantees  to \n1I0W \nall  citizens  the  \"equal  protection  of  laws.\"  In  Brown \nY. \nBoard  of  Education,  347  U.  S.  483  (1954-),  349  U.  S.  294 \n(1955),  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  racial  segregation  in \npublic  schools  produces  inferior  education  and  morale,  re \nstricts  opportunity  for  association,  and  thus  violates  the \nequal  protection  guaranty  of  the  Constitution  and  is  un \nlawful.  In  Green  ,.  New  Kent  County  School  Board,  391 \n\n60a \nOrder  dated  August \n15, 1969 \nU.  S.  430  (1968),  and  two  other  simultaneouo  unanimous \ndecisions,  t.he  Supreme  Court  held  that  school  boards  have \nthe  affirmative  to  get  rid  of  dual  school  systems,  to \nduty \neliminate  \"black  schools\"  and  \"white  schools,\"  and  to  oper \nate  \"just  schools.\"  The  Court  said; \n\"The burden  on  a  school  board today is  to  come  forward \nwith  a  plan  that  promises  realistically  to  work  and \npromises  realistically  to  work  now.\"  (Emphasis  on  the \nword \"now\"  was  put in  the  text by the  Supreme Court.) \nFa)' years people of this community and all over the  south \nhave  quoted  wistfully  the  statement in Briggs  v.

Unless  and  until  the \nConst.itution  is  amended  it  is  and  will  be  unlawful to  oper \nate  segregated  public  schools.  Amending  tho  Constitution \ntakes  heavy  majorities  of  voters  or  lawmakers.

None  have  power  to  change  it except by law \nful  means.  None  have  or  claim  the  power  to  interfere  with \nthe  courts  in  cases  like  this  one.  The  malleable  HEW \n\"guidelines\"  put  out  by  the  President's  administrator  for \neducational affairs, and dubious  inferences from  statements \nof  other  officials,  however  highly  placed,  are  irrelevant  to \nthe  constitutional  rights  of  parties  this  case.  Also \nthe  in \nirrelevant  are  soothing  sayings  of  the Vice  President  (who \nhas  the  duty  in  this  area)  to  black-tie  political  audiences, \nand  the  not-so-soothing sayings  of citizens who  erroneously \ntalk  as  if t.he  schoo]  segregation  issue  were  a  simple matter \nof political pressure  and  short-term  public  opinion.  As  for \nthe  Attorney  General of the  United  States, he  bas  just filed \nthe  biggest  desegregation  suit  of  all  against  the  whole \nSta,te  of Georgia.!  Segregation of children in  public schools, \nwhether  they be  black  or  white,  and  regardless  of whether \nthey  do  or  don't  want  to  stay  apart,  is  unlawful.  As  the \nSupreme  Court  said  in  Brown II: \n\" . . .  the  vitality  of  these  constitutional  principles  can \nnot be  allowed  to yield  simply because  of disagreement \nwith  them.\" \nTHE  SCHOOL  BOARD's  NEw  PLAN  REPRESENTS  SUBSTANTIAL \nPROGRESS. \nAgainst  this  background  the  Board's  llew  plan  is  re-\no \nviewed: \n1.  The most obvious  and constructive element in  the  plan \nis  that  the  School  Board  has  reversed  its  field  and has  ac \ncepted  its  affirmative  constitutional  duty  to  desegregat.e \npupils,  teachers,  principals  and  staff  members  \"at  the \nearliest possible date.\"  I t  has  recognized  that where  people \n\n-- - -\n-\n63a \nOrder  dated  August \n15.0196.9 \nlive  should  not  control  where  they  to  school  nor  the \ngo \nquality  of  their  education,  and  that  transportation  may  he \nnecessary  to  comply  with  the  law.  It  has  recognized  that \ncasy  methods  will  not  do  the  job;  that.  rezoning  of  school \n• \nlines,  perhaps  wholesale;  pairing,  grouping  or  clustering \nof  schools;  lise  of  computer  technology  and  all  available \nmodern  business  methods  can  and  must  be  considered  in \nthe  discharge of the Board's constitut.ional  duty.  This  court \ndoes  not  take  lightly  the  Board's  promises  and  the  Board's \nunder·taking  of  itH  affirmative  dui:y  under  the  Constitution \nand  accepts  these  assurances  at  face  valne.  They  are,  in \nfact,  the  concltlsions  which  necessarily  follow  when  any \ngroup  of  women  and  men  of good  faith  serionsly study  this \nproblem  with  knowledge  of  the  facts  of  this  school  system.. \nand in-light  of the  law  of t.he  land. \n• \n2.  In  the  second  place,  by  the  following  actions  the \nBoard  has  demonstrated  its  aeceptance  of  its  stated  new \npolicies: \na)  The  desegregation  of faculties  and  the  non-racial \nreassignment  of  principals  and  employees  from newly \nclosed  schools.  In  the  formerly  all-black  faculties  the \nBoard  has  dramatically  exceeded  its  goal.  I t   is  as \nsumed  by  the  court  that  this  process  of  faculty  de \nsegregation  will  continue  and  that.  the  goal  for  1970-71 \nwill  be  that faculties  in all schools will  approach a  ratio \nunder  which  all  schools  in  the  system  will  have  ap \nproximately  the  same  proportion  of  black  and  white \nteachers. \n• \nb)  The  closing  of  sevell  schools  and  the  reassign \nment  of  3,000  black  pupils  to  schools  offering  better \neducation. \n\n64a \nOrdet·  dated  A ugu.st \n15,  1969 \nc)  The  J'eu:3sigornent  of  1,245  students  from  several \novercrowded  primarily  black  schools  to  a  number  of \noutlying  predominantly  white  schools. \nd}  The  announced  re-evaluat.ion  of  the  program  of \nlocating  and  building  aIHl  improving  schools,  so  that \neach  project  or  site  will  prod lice  the  \"greatest  degree \nof  desegregation  possible.\" \ne)  The Board  correctly and constructively concluded \nthat  the  so-caUed  \"anti-bnssing  law\"  adopted  by  the \nGeneral  Assembly  of  North  Carolina  on  June 24,  1969, \ndoes  not  inhibit  the  Board  in  carl'ying out  its  constitu \ntional  duties  and  should  not  bamper  the  Board  in  its \nfut.ure  actions.  Leaving  aside  its  dubious  constitu \ntionality  (if  it  reany  did  what  its  title  claims  to  do) \nthe  statute  contains  an  express  exception  which  ren \nders  it  ineffectual  in  that  it  docs  not  prevent  \"any \ntransfer  necessitated  hv  overcrowded  conditions  or \n• \notllet· circwtnsta.nces  which  in.  the  sale  discref.ion  of  the \nSchool  Board  reqll.ire  reassignm.ent.\" \nf)  The  elimillation  without  objection  of  the  former \nprovision  which  had  the  effect  of  inhibiting  transfer \nrights  of black would-be  athletes. \ng)  Quite significantly, the Board calls  upon  the  Plan \nning Board, the Housing Aut.hority,  the Redevelopment \nCommission  and  upon  real  estate  interests,  local  gov \nernment  and  other  interested  part.ies  to  recognize  and \nshare  their  responsibility  for  dealing  with  problems \nof  segregation  in  the  commnnity  at large  as  well  as  in \nthe  school  system. \nh)  The  proposals  for  programs  of  \"compensatory \neducation\" of students, and  for  teacher  orientation  and \n\n- - - - - - - - - - _ . _ - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n_. \n65a \nOrder  daled  August \nl:J,  196.') \nexchnnge  of  activities  among  hlack  and  ,,\"Ilite  gtlldents. \n, \n~ \nThe eOllrt  assumes  thnt  t.hese  somewhat  vaguely  stated \nideas  will  become  implcmented  with  concl'ete  action. \n, \n3.

Threats \nof  boycotts  [lnd  strikes  have  been  puhlici7.ed. \nThis  part  of  the  plan  is  distasteful,  because  all  but  200· \nof  the  students  being  reassigned  en  masse  are  black.  It. \ncan  legitimately  be  said  and  has  been  eloquelltly  said  that \nthis  plan  is  an  affront  to  the  dignity  and  pride  of  the \nhlack  citizcns.  Pride  and  digni ty  are  important.  I f  pride \narc \nU11d  dignity  were  all  that  involved,  this  part  of  the \nplan  ought  t.o  be  disapproved.  The  court,  out  of  forty \nyear  memory  of  four  years  of  trallsportation  on  an  un \nheated  school  but  thirteen  miles  each  way  from \n~fodel-T \na  distant  rural  community  to  high  school  in  a  \"city\"  of \n4,000,  is  fully  a \\Va re  how  alien  and  strange  arc  the  sensa \nt.ions  experienced  by  a  school  child  who  is  hauled  out  of \nhis  community  and  into  a  place  where  the  initial \nOW11 \nis \nwelcome  uncertain  cool. \n01' \n•  The  200  st.udents  beillg  fl'om  Paw  Creek  to  Wood \nrens~igned \nland  nre  white. \n\n66a \nOrder  dated  A-ugu.st \n15,  1969 \nHowever,  this  part  of  the  plan  is  not  compulsory. \nStudents  who  want  to  remain  in  the  comfort  of  their \nfamiliar  area may  elect  to  attend  the  Zebulon Vance  School \ninstead;  alternatives  are  also  provided  for  the  junior  high \nschool  students. \nMoreover,  as  one  of  the  attorneys  remarked  at  the  first \nin \nhearing  a  discussiOll  about  reassignments  and  school \nbusses:  \"The  question  is  really  not  one  of  'bussing'  but \nwhether  what  the  child  gets  when  he  gets  off  of the  bus  is \nworth  the  trouble.\" \nI  personally  found  the  better  education  worth  the  bus \ntrip. \nDespite  their  undoubted  importance,  pride  and  dignity \nshould  not  control  over  the  Constitution  and  should  not \noutweigh  the  prospects  for  quality  education  of  children. \nThe  uncontradicted  evidence  before  the  court  is  that \nsegregation  in  Mecklenburg  County  has  produced  its \ninevitable  results  in  the  retarded  educational  achievement \nand  capacity  of  segregated  school  children.  By  way  of \nbrief  illustration  a  table  follows  showing  the  contrasting \nachievements  of  sixth  grade  students  in  five  of  the  closed \n• \nschools  (Bethune,  Fairview,  Isabella  Wyche,  Alexander \nStreet  and  Zeb  Vance)  and  in  five  of  the  schools  to  which \nblack  students  are  going  to  be  transferred: \n\n67a \nOrder  dated  August \n15,  1969 \nAVERAGE  ACHIEVEM1::NT  TEST  SCORES \n1968-69 \nSIXTH  GRADE \nA.eM.

The  experts  and  administrators  all  agreed  that \ntransferring  underprivileged  black  children  from  black \nschools  into  schools  with  70ro  or  more  white  students  pro \nduced  a  dramatic  improvement  in  the  rate  of  progress  and \nan increase in the absolute performance of the less advanced \nstudents,  without  material  detriment  to  the  whites.  There \nwas  no  contrary  evidence.  (In  this  system  71%  of  the \nstudents  arc  white  and  29%  are  black.) \nMoreover,  the.  Board's  announced  policy  and  the  uncon \ntradicted  testimony  of  the  superintendent  show  that \nserious  arrangements  are  being;  made  to  welcome.,  rather \nthan  rebuff,  the  transferees  into  all  school  activities.  This \nis  something  new  and  important. \nNo  legal  authority  is  cited  that  the  Constitution  pro \nhibits  transport  of  conse-nting  black  children  from  an \ninferior  educational  envirorunent  into  a  better  educational \nenvironment  for  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  con \nstitutional  requirement  of  equal  protection  of  laws. \nThe  choice  of  how  to  do  the  job  of  desegregation  is  for \nthe  School  Board  ·not  for  the  court. \nThe  Board  has  wide  discretion  in  choosing  methods; \nmany  effective  methods  are  described  in  the  evidence;  the \ncourt's duty is simply to  pass  on the  legality of the  Board's \nactions.  I t  appears  to  the  court  that  the  improvement  in \nthe  education  of  4,200  school  children  is  the  one  most \nobvious  result  of  the  Board's  plan  of  action  for  1969-70, \nand  that this  is  more  important constitutionally  than  other \nconsiderations  which  have  been  advanced. \nI t  is  not  the  intention  of  this  court  to  endorse  or  ap \nprove  any future  plan which  puts  the  burden of  desegrega \ntion  primarily  upon  one  race.  However,  there  is  not  time \nbefore  September  2,  1969  to  do  a  complete  job  of  reassign-\n\n69a \nOrde·r  dated  A ugttst \n15,  1969 \ning  pupils;  the  plan  is  a  step  toward  more  complete \ncompliance  with  the  law;  the  court  reluctantly  votes  in \nfavor  of  the  4,200  school  childre.n  anu  approves  the  plan: \n• \non  a  011e-year  basis. \n• \nTHE  l\\fAJOR  TASK  LIES  AHEAD  THIS  FAIJ. \nThe  big  job  remains  to  be  dOlle.  After  implementation \nof  the  current  plan,  further  large  scale  faculty  transfers \nwill still be  necessary.  Sixteen  years  after Brown v.  Board \nof Education,  some  thirteen  thousand  school  children  will \nremain  in  black  or  nearly  all-black  schools.  Most  white \nstudents  will  remain  in  substantially  all-white  schools. \nThe  failure  of  the  plan  to  deal  with  those  problems  of \ncourse  can  not  be  approved.  'rhe  failure  of  the  plan  to \ninclude  a  time  table  for  the  performance  of  specific  ele \nments  of  the  program  of  course  ca.n  not  be  approved, \nFelder,  et at.  v.  Harnett  Cou.nty  Boanl  of Education,  et  al., \n409  F.  2d  1070  (4th  Cir.,  1968).  These  matters  must  be \ncovered  by  specific  instructions  to  the  Board. \nAll  findings  of  fact  in  the  previous  orders  of  April  23, \n1969,  and  June  20,  1969,  and  the  supplemental  findings \nof  June  24,  1969,  are  incorporated  herein  to  the  ext.ent \nthat  t.hey  are  consistent  with  the  findings,  conclusions  and \norders  herein  reached  and  given.  All  c\\\"idcl1Ce  at  all  hear \nings  is  considered  in  reaching'  these  conclusions. \nORDER \n1.  The  policy  statement  of  Uw  Bonrd  is  npproved. \n2.  The  faculty  desegregation  program  is  approved. \n• \n3.  The  plan  to  desegregate  pupils  by  closing  seven  all \nblack  schools  and  assigning  their  pupils  to  outlying  white \n\n70a \nOrder  dated  August \nlS,  196.9 \nschools  is  approved  only  (1)  with  great  reluctance,  (2)  as \na  one-year,  temporary  arrangement,  and  (3)  with  the \ndistinct  reservation  that  \"one-way  bussing\"  plans  for  the \nyears  after 1969-70  will  not be  acceptable.  If,  as  the  school \nsuperintendent  testified,  none  of  the  modern,  facu1ty \nintegrated,  expensive,  \"equal\"  black  schools  in  the  system \nare  suitable  for  desegregation  steps  can  and  should \nDOW, \nhe  taken  to  change  that  condition  before  the  fall  of  1970. \nUnsuitability  or  inadequacy  of  a  1970  \"black\"  school  to \neducate  1970  white  pupils  will  not  be  considered  by  the \ncourt  in  passing  upon  plans  for  1970  desegregation.  The \ndefendants  contended  and  the  court  found  ill  its  April  23, \n1969  order  that facilities  and  teachers  in the  various  black \nschools  were  not  measurably  inferior  to  those  in  the \nvarious  white  schools.  It  is  too  late  now  to  expect  the \ncourt  to  proceed  upon  an  opposite  assumption. \n4.  The  plan  to  reassign  1,245  students  from  presently \novercrowded  black  schools  is  approved. \n5.  Reassignment  of  the  Paw  Creek  students  to  Wood \nland  is  approved. \n6.  The  proposals  of  the  Board  for  restructure  of  atten \ndance  lines;  for  consideration  of  pairing  and  grouping \nschools;  for  review  of  the  construction  programs;  and  for \nsupport  programs,  student  exchange  and  faculty  orienta \ntion are  approved  in  principle,  although  for  lack  of specific \ndetail  and  time  table  they  are  not  approved  as  presented. \n7.  The  Board  is  directed  to  prepare  and  present  by \nNovember  17,  1969,  the  following: \n(1)  Plan  for  complete  faculty  desegregation  for \n1970-71. \n\n- - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n----~--. \n71[1. \nOrder  dated  August \n15, 1969 \n(2)  Plan  for  student  dese 'Tcgation  for  1970-71,  in \n6\ncluding  making  full  use  of  zoning,  pairing,  grouping, \nclustering,  transportation  and  other  techniques,  com \nplete  with  statistics  and  maps  and  other  data  showing \nprecisely  what  (subject  to  later  movement  of  pupils) \nthc  assignment  of  pupils  and  teachers  will  be  for  the \nyear  1970-71,  having  in  mind  as  its  goal  for  1970-71 \nthe  complete  desegregati011  of the  enti re  system  to  the \nmaximum  extent  possible.  (The  assumption  in  the \nBoard's  report  that  a  school  is  desegregated  when  i t  \nhas  as  many  as  10%  of  a  minority  race  in  its  student \nbody  is  not  accepted  by  the  court,  and  neither  the \nBoard nor the court should be  guided  by  such  a  figure.) \n\"Possible\"  as  used  here  refers  to  educational  not \n1f \n\"political\"  possibility.  Anson  County,  two-thirds \nblack,  can  totally  desegregate  its  schools  in  1969,  as \nthey  have  now  done,  Mecklenburg'  County  should  be \nwil1 \nable  to muster  the  political  to  follow  sui t. \n(3)  A  detailed  report  showing,  complete  with \nfigures  and  maps,  the  location  and  nature  of  each \nconstruction  project  proposed  or  under  way,  and  the \neffect  this  project may  reasonably  be  expected  to  have \nupon  thc  program  of  desegregating  the  schools . \n• \n8.  Since  a  mid-city  high  school  may  prove  most  desir \nable,  the  Board is  directed  pending further  orders  of court \nnot to  divest itsolf of  any land,  options,  rent  arrangements \nor other  access  to  or  control  over  real  estate  which  it  may \n• \n•  nOw  have  in  the  Second  \\Vard  area . \n9.

McMillan \nUnited  States  District  Judge \n\n72a \nOrder  dated  August  29,  1969 \nThe  School  Board's  amended  plan  for  desegregation  of \nthe  Charlotte-Mecklenl)urg  schools  was  approved  by  order \nof  court  dated  August  15,  1969.  The  Board  has  now  ten \ndered  a  modification  to  this  plUll  which  filed  today, \nwas \nAugust 29,  1969. \nThe  modification  relates  to  facilities  to  provided \nthe  be \nfor  those  black  children  whose  parents  exereise  freedom  of \nchoice  to  attend  a  black  elementary  school  in  the  inner  city \ninstead  of  attending  the  white  schools  listed  in  the  July  29, \n1969  plan which  has  already  heen  approycd  by  the  court. \nThe  amendment  calls  for  using  the  buildillg  of  former \nIrwin  Avenue  Junior High  School  ·with  certain minor  reno \nvations,  instead  of  Zeb  Vance  School,  and  a  limit  of  six. \nhundred  st.udents  upon  those  who  would  be  admitted  to \nthis  program  at  Irwin  Avenue  School.  This  part  of  the \nmotion  to  amend  is  approved.  The  choice  of  building,  per \nse,  is  a  matter  for  the  School  Board,  not  the  court. \nThe  amendment  proposes  that  the  Irwin  Avenue  Scbool \nwould  be  operated  Has  an  innovative  school.\"  The  court \ndoes  not know  wbat  this  means.  I f  by  tbis  phrase  i\"  meant \nthat  anything will  be  done  to  make  this  school  more  attrac \ntive  to  the  black  students  thaD  the  black  schools  tbey  have \nbeen  attending,  then  the  program  will  constitute  the  loca \ntion  and  use  of  a  school  faeility  for  the  purpose  of  promot \ning  segregation  which  by  previous  decisions  of  this  and \nothel·  courts  the  defendants  have  been  fully  advised  is  un \nconstitutional.

The  addition  of  \"innova \ntions\"  at  Irwin  Avenue  School  will  not  be  approved by  the \ncourt  unless  these  \"innovations\"  have  been  arranged  and \n\n73a \nOrde1'  dnted \nA1l.gUSt  29,  1969 \nprovided  for  all  the  black  students  who  transfer  to  white \nschools under the .July 20,  1969  plml  of the Board  previonsly \napproved.  The  phrase  \"iTlllOvative\"  may  refer  to  what.  t.he \nBoard  bas  heretofore  called  \"compellsatory  education.\" \n. The  1't  has  not  yet.  been  advised  of  any  performance  by \nCOll \ntho  Board  in  lille  with  the  undertaking  in  its  .July  29,  1969 \nplan  to  provide  \"compensatory  education\"  for  pupils  who \nlag behind their classmates in  academic achievement.  Unless \nand  unt.il  t.he  court  can  be  informed  and  satisfied  tbat  this \n\"compensatory  education\"  is  provided  in  the  other'  schools, \nthe  conrt  is  of  the  opinion  that  IJI'o\\riding  it  in  the  Irwin \nA venue  School  would  set  up  a  magnet  to  attract  blnck \nchildren  away  from  desegregated  assignments  and  there \nfore  on  the  present  record  at  least  t.hat  part  of  the  plan  is \ndisapproved. \nThe  proposal  to  provide  transportation  for  any  of  the \nstudents  attendillg  Irwin  Avenue  School  is  expressly  dis \napproved.  The.  effect of  providing  transportation  is  to  sub \nsidize  at.  tax  payers'  expense  those  who  arc actiVely  seeki1lg \nto  defeat  the  eonstitutionui  mandate  to  desegregate  the \nschools.  No  authority  is  advanced  suggested  to  justify \n01\" \nsuch  a  flagrant  violation  of  t.Ire  law,  and  none  has  been \nimngincfl  hy  the  court.  The  Board  is  expressly  rest.mined \nfJ\"Om  and  enjoined  against  providing  transportation  ill  any \nform  to  any  student  in  the  system,  black  or  white,  which \nmayor might enable him  to  travel  any  part of  the  distance \nfrom  his  home  to  or  from  any  school  elected  by  or  for  him \nunder \"freedom  of transfer\"  or  \"freedom  of choice,\"  except \nthat  the  Board  may  provide  transportation  as  previously \nordered by this court to  those students who  elect  to  transfc1' \nor who  are transfcITcd by  the Board  from  a  school  in  which \ntheir  race  is  in  a  majority  to  a  school  in  which  their  racc \n• \n\n74a \nOrder  d.ated  August \n29,  1969 \nis  in  the  minority.  As  this  court  pointed  out  before,  bus \ntransportation has  too  long  been  used  as  a  tool  to  promote \nsegregation.  The  year  1969  is  too  late  ill  the  day  to  start \nusing  this  tool for  that purpose in  new  situations. \nThis  the  29th  day  of August,  1969. \n/ s /   B.  McMILLAN \nJAMES \nJames  B.  McMillan \nUnited  States  District  Judge \n\n75a \nOrder  dated  October  10,  1969 \nOn  April  2:3,  June  20  and  August  15,  1969,  orders  were \nentered  directing  thc  defendants  to  submit  a  plan  and  a \ntime  t.able  for  the  desegregation  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklen \nburg  schools,  to  be  completed  by  the  fall  of  1970.  Nearly \nsix  months  after  the  original  order,  faculty  desegregation \nis  well  along  and  there  have  been  a  number  of  substantial \nimpl'ovements  in the  stated  policies  of the  Board,  including \nthe  stated  assumpt.ion  of  duty  by  the  Board  to  desegregate \nthe  schoools  \"at.  the  earliest  possible  date.\"  Limited  steps \nhave  been  taken  toward  compliance  with  the  pupil  desegre \ngation  provisions  of  that  original  order.  However,  the \nmajor  part  of  the  job  remains  undone,  and  no  plan  for \ndesegregation  of  the  entire  sy::;tem  has  apparently  been \nvoted  by the  Board. \n011 \nThe  latest  order'  set  November  17,  1969,  as  the  revised \ndate  for  defendants  to  file  a  complete  plan  and  time  tallle. \nDefendants have now filed  a  15-page motion and supporting \naffidavit  asking  the  court  to  extend  anothc,'  two  and \nby \none-half  months,  to  Februa I'y  1,  1970,  the  time  fo\\'  com \npliance  with  the  orders.  Plaintiffs  oppose  the  extension. \nThc  justification  advanced  for  this  dclay  is  that  they \nhave  hired  a  systems  analyst  to  rc-dmw  attendance  lines, \nand  that  the  three  months  between  August  15  and  Novem \nber  17  are  not  enough  time  to  program  a  computer  and \nprepare  a  plan. \nI t  would  be  a  happy  day  if  t.he  job  could  he  turned  over \nto  a  computer.  A  computer,  if  pl'ogmmmed  objectively, \n• \ncould produce objective  results;  all could blame  the machine \n(in  addition  to  the  COUl't)  for  any  unp]easnnt  decisions. \nALso,  the  court  wouLd  like  to  avoid  unnecessary  pressmc \non the  school  staff and  administrators. \nHowever, the information thus far available is inadequate \nto  justify  the  extension.  Computers  are  for  time-sa.ving, \n\n76a \nOrder  dated  October \n10,  1969 \nnot delay.  The computer work was estimated by the Board's \nchosen  systems  analyst,  Mr.  ,\"Veil,  to  require  ninety  man \ndays  of  work.  He  proposes  to  consume  ninety  calendar \ndays  witb  this  job!  The  Board's  motion  says  that  their \ndecisions  about  construction  and  location  of  21  building \nprojects  (involving  mallY  millions  of  dollars)  nre  to  be \nheld  up  pendillg  development  of  the  plan.  The  school  hud \nget  approacbes  fifty  million  dollars.  The  question  fairly \narises  why  the  Board  should  not  employ  or  assign  more \nthau  one person at a  time to  feed  the  computer.  Mr.  Weil's \noriginal  plan,  which  is  in  evidence,  was  prepared  in  a  very \nfew  days.  The  court  has  on  file  also  three  or  four  other \nplans,  including  at  least one  which  local  school  officials  say \nis  educationally  and  technically  feasible,  wbich  were  pre \npared  in  a  few  days  each.  The  use  of  a  computer  does  not \nappear  to  justify  the  delay. \nMoreover,  computers  cannot  make  political  nor  legal  de \ncisions; they react  to  what is  fed  into them; and  the  request \nfor  postponement  leaves  the  court  to  speculate  over  what \nwill  he  fed  into  the  computer.  The  motion  does  not  say \nthat Mr.  Weil  has  becn  instructed  bv  the  Board to  frame  a \n• \nplan  to  desegregate  the  schools;  his  commission,  by  a \nBoard  committee  only,  is  limited  to  re-drawing  attendance \nlines;  the  vague  references  in  the  Board's  motion  to  his \ninstructions  as  to  travel  limitation  and  specified  sehool \ncapacities and  desirable  racial balance  permit the  inference, \nin  fact,  that  his  mission  could  be  re-segregation  of  much \nof  the  system. \nThe  motion  also  contains  no  commitment  on  the  part  of \nthe  Board  to  adopt  any  plan  that  the  computer  may  pro \nduce;  it  gives  no  information  about  the  Board's  intentions \nit \nas  to  other desegregation  methods  it will  use;  prom \na11d \nises  no  result  from  the  delay  except  consideration.  by  the \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n77a \nOrder  dated  Ocf.ober \n10,  1969 \nBoard  of  a  computer  plan  fOl\"  fo-arranging  school  lines. \nThe  motion  is  preoccupied  with  OIle  'method,  and  silent \nahout  results. \nBefore  pnssing  on  the  motion,  the  court  has  a  duty  to \ndiscover whnt  the  Board  has accomplished  sinco  its  July  29 \npromises  wore  made,  and  whether  tho  oxtra  time  will  pro \nmote  genuine  progress  toward  compliance  with  the  Consti \ntution  whet.her  it.  will  just  be  time  lost. \n01' \nTho  Bonrd  is  thol'efol'o  direetod  to  file  with  the  court.  by \n• \nOctober  29,  1069,  the  following  informatioll: \n1.

All  the  transferee  schools  ex \ncept  West  Charlotte  were  white.  In  addition,  1,245  black \nstudents,  in  specified  were  to  be  transferred  from \nnumbers~ \neight  black  or  largely  black  schools  to  other  designated \nsuburban  white  schools. \nThe  plan  was  accepted  and  approved  because  of  its  ap \nparent  promise  to  extend  tb'€   opportunities  of  a  desegre \ngated  education  to  Over  4,000  new  black  students. \nThe  plan  bas  not  becn  carried  out.  as  advertised:  (a) \nOnly  73  of  t.he  1,245  scheduled  for  transfer  from  over \ncrowded  black  schools  have  been  so  transferred;  those  73 \nwere  transferred not to  the schools  designated, but to  other \nschools  not  mentioned  ill  the  plan.  (b)  I t  is  now  revealed \nthat  the  closed  schools,  which  were  billed  in  July  to  pro \nduce  3,000  black  students  for  transfer,  actually  had  only \n2,627  studmlt.s  in  them  whell  the  schools  closed  in  June! \n• \n(c)  The  Board  allowed  full  fre(!clom  of  choice  for  students \nfrom  the  closed  schools,  and  those  stndents  ill  large  num \nhers  elected  to go  to  Harding High  School,  and  to  Williams \nJunior  Higb,  Northwest  .Junior  High  and  ot.her  black \nschools,  instead  of  to  the  assigned  white  scbools.  As  a  re \nsnlt,  Harding  High  School  was  transformed  immediately \n• \n\n84a \nMemorandum  Opinion  dated  Noveml}cr \n7,  1969 \nfrom  17%  hlaek  to  47%  black.  This  produced  community \nconsternation  but  no  racial  disorder  among  the  students. \nThe  result may be  deplorable,  but the  fact  that the  students \nat  Harding  High  School  have  adjusted  peaceably  to  the \nsituation  (like  others  before  them  a t.  Cornelius,  Dav  idsan, \nOlympic,  Randolph  Road,  Hawthorne  and  Elizabeth.  and \n• \nlike  the  people of Anson  and ot11or  North  Carolina counties) \nshows  that  lfecklenburgers  live  with  desegregated \nCRll \nschools.  (d)  The  transfers  proposed  simply  appear  never \nto  have  been  made  to  most  of  the  suburban  schools  named \nin  the  plan.

More  than  16,000,  however,  are  obviously \nstill in  all-black  or  predominantly black  schools.  The  9,216 \nin  100ro  black  situations  are  considerably  more  than  the \nnumber  of  black  students  in  Charlotte  in  1954  at  the  time \nBrown \nof  the  first  decision.  The  black  school  problem  has \nnot  been  solved. \nThe  schools  are  still  in  major  part  segregated  or  \"dual\" \nrather  than  desegregated  or  \"unitary.\" \nThe  black  schools  are  for  the  most  part in  black  residen \ntial  areas.  However,  that  does  not  make  their  segregation \nconstitutionally  benign.  III  previous  opinions  the  facts  re \nspecting  their  locations,  their  controlled  size  and  their \npopulation  have  already  been  found.  Briefly  summarized, \nthese  facts  are  that  the  present  location  of  white  schools \nin  white  areas  and  of  black  schools  in  black  areRS  is  the \nresult  of  a  varied  group  of  elements  of  public  and  private \naction,  all  deriving  their  basic  strength  originally  from \n\n87a \ntVI emorandu'm  Opinion  dated  N ovem.ber \n7,  1969 \npublic law  or  state  or  local  governmental  action.  These  ele \nments  include  among  others  the  legal  separation  of  the \nraces  in schools,  school  busses,  public  accommodations  and \nhousing;  racial  restrictions  in  deeds  to  land;  zoning  ordi \nnances;  city  planning;  urban  renewal;  location  of  public \nlow  rent  housing:  and  the  actions  of  the  present  School \nBoard  and  others,  before  and  since  1954,  in  locating  and \ncontrolling  the  capacity  of  schools  so  that  there  would \nusually  be  black  schools  handy  to  black  llOighboJ'llOods  and \nwhite  schools  for  white  neighborhoods.  There  is  so  much \nstate action  embedded  in  and  shaping  f;hese  events  that  the \nresulting  segregation  is  not  innocent  or  facto,\"  and  the \n(Ide \nresulting  schools  are  not  \"unitary\"  or  desegregated. \nCHOler. \nFREEDOM  OF \nFreedom  of  choice  has  tended  to  perpetuate  segregation \nby  allowing  children  to  get  out of schools  where  their  race \nwould  be in a  minority.  The  essential failure  of'  the  Board's \n1969  pupil  plan  was  in  good  measure  due  to  freedom  of \nchoice. \nAs  the  court  recalls  the  evidence,  it  shows  that  white \nn·G \nstudents  have  ever  chosen  to  attend  any  of  the  \"black\" \nschool,s. \nFreedom  of  choice  does  not  make  a  segregated  school \nsystem  lawful.  As  the  Supreme  Court  said  in  Green  v. \nNew  Kent  County,  391  U.S.  430  (1968): \n• \n\" .   •  •  I f  there  are  reasonably  available  other  ways, \nsuch  for illustration  as  zoning,  promising  speedier  and \nmore effective conversion  to  a  unitary, nonracial school \nsystem,  'freedom of choice' must be  held  unacceptable.\" \n•,  \nRedrawing  attendance  lines  is  not  likely  to  accomplish \nanything  stable  toward  obeying  the  constitutional  mandate \n• \n\n• \n880. \nkle'l11orandum  Opinion  dated  Noveml}cr \n7,  1969 \nas  long  as  freedom  of  choice  or  freedom  of  transfer  is  re \ntained.  The  operation  of  these  schools  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture  should  not  include  freedom  of  choice  or  transfer \nexcept  to  the  extel1t  that  it  reduces  segregation,  although \nof  course  the  Board  under  its  statutory  power  of  assign \nment  can  assign  any  pupil  to  any  Rchool  for  any  lawful \nreason. \nThe  defendants  filed  some  statistics  concerning  the  one \nhundred largest school  systems  in  the country,  and say  that \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  desegregatioll  compares  favorably \nwith  that  in  roost  of  those  systems.  That  may  well  be  so. \nThe  court  is  not  trying  cases  involving  the  other  ninety \nnine  school  boards,  and has  110t  studied  any  evidence  abont \nthem  and  does  not  know  their  factual  nor  legal  problems. \nThe  court  in  its  first  order  of  April  23,  1969  has  noted  the \nsubstantial  desegregation  achieved  in  certain  areas  in  the \nChaJ\"lotte-r..(ecklenburg  system,  and  is  still aware  of  it.  Tho \nfact  that  other  communities  might  bC'  more  baclnvard  in \nobserving  the  Constitution  than  Mecklonburg  would  hardly \nseem  to  support  denial  of  constitutional  rights  to  Mecklen \nburg  citizens.  The  court  doubts  that  u  double  standard \nexists.  The  Attorney  General  of  the  United  States  has \nfiled  suit for  desegregation  in  Connecticut as  well  as in  the \nwhole  State  of  Georgia.  One  of  the  most  stringent  de \nsegregation  orders  on  record  was  entered  recently  against \na  school board in  the  City of  Chicago.  Constitutional  rights \nwill  not he  denied  here  simply  because  they  may  be  denied \ndelayed  elsewhere.  There  is  no  \"Dow-Jones  average\" \n0)\" \nfor  such  rights.  With  all  due  deference  to  the  complexities \nof  this  scbool  system,  which  have  already  been fully  noted \n\n89a \ndatelZ \nMemorandum.

From  the  testimony  of  its  members, \nand  from  the  latest  report,  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  a \nmajority  of  its  members  have  accepted  the  court's  orders \nas  representing  the  law  which  applies  to  the  local  schools. \n\n.. \n• \n91a \n111 cmorandum  Opinion.  dated  N ovem1Jcr \n7)  196.9 \nBy  the  responses  to  the  October  10  questions,  the  Board \nhas  indicated  that  its  members  do  not  accept  the  duty  to \ndesegrcgate  the  schools  at  any  ascertainablc  time;  and \nthey  have  clearly  indicated  that  they  intend  not  to  do  it \neffective  in  tho  fall  of  1970.  They  have  also  demonstrated \na  yawning  gap  hetween  predictions  and  performance. \nWithholding  or  delaying  the  constitutional  rights  of \nchildren  to  equal  educational  opportnni ty  on  such  vague \nterms  as  these  is  not  the  province  of the  School  Board \n1Ior \nof  this  court. \nFurthermore,  since  the  Supreme  Court  has  now  pro \nhibited  lower  courts  from  granting  extensiollS  of  time,  it \nmay  we]]  he  that  gmdual  time  table  laid  down  by  this \nthl~ \ncourt's  Apl'il  23,  1969  order  contemplating  substantial \nprogress  in  1969  and complete  dcsegrcgation  hy  September \n1970)  was  and  is  too  lenient. \nI f  the  plan  tendered  by  the  School  Board  on  November \n17,1969 is  thol'ough  a11(1  informative,  and  sufficiently  shows \nan  unconditional  purpose  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to  com \nplete  its  joh  effective  by  September,  1970,  the  Board  may \nperhaps  be  allowed  to  adhere  to  the  exist.ing  time  table. \nCertainly  a  Mecklenburg  plan  ought  if  possible  to  be  pre \npared  by  the  :Mecklenburg  School  Board  and  its  large  and \nexperienced  staff,  I'ather  than  by  outside  experts.

The  findings  of  fact  in  this  opinion \nbe  considered,  along  with  facts  found  in  previous  orders, \nopinions and memoranda, as the  basis  for  such  future  judg \nments  and  orders  as  may  be  appropriate,  including  such \njudgments  and  orders  as  may  be  appropriate  upon  receipt \nof  the  Board's  November  17,  1969  plan.

The  defendants  have  admitted  their  duty  to \ndesegregate  the  schools;  considerable  progress  has  been \nmade  toward  desegregation  of faculties;  and  progress,  pre \nviously  noted,  lIa::;  been  made  in  some  other  aroas.  The \nschools,  however,  remain  for  the  most  part  unlawfully \nsegregated.  The  facts  supporting  that  concl usion  in  all \nthe  court's  previolls  orders  are  reiterat.ed  here. \nThe  issue  is  what  to  do  punHlant  to  the  board's  latest \nplan,  filed  November  17,  1969.  The  plan  recites  the  follow \ning  ostensible  purpose: \n\"The  Board  of  Education  has  embarked  upon  a  com \nprehensive  program  for  the  pu rpose  of  restructuring \nattendance  lines  involving  all  schools  and  all  students \nsel'ved  by  the  sYBtem.  The  primary  purpose  of  this \nprogram  is  to  achieve  further  desegregation  •  as \n111 \n1;0.\" \nmany  schools  as  possible  '.  • \nThe  plan  says  that  a  computer  analyst  has  been  hired \nto  draw  up  various  theoretical  possible  school  zone  atten \ndance  lines,  and  that  school  personnel,  before  February  1, \n1970,  will  draw  the  aetnal  lines. \nThe  details  of  the  plan  show  that  it contains  no  promise \nnor  likelihood  of  desegregating  the  schools. \nThe  plan  and  the  report  accompanying  it  say  (emphasis \nadded) : \nuN  school district to  which white  students  a·re  assig-ned \n0 \nshould have less  than  60  Pc)'  cent white  student popula \ntion  to  avoid  'tipping.'\"  (Plan,  page  2.) \n•  •  • \nII \n\n- --- -\n. \n94a \nand  Order  dated  December \n1,  1969 \nOpi1~ion \n\"  . . .  it is  the  plan  of  this  School  Board  to  limit  schools \nto  which  white  students  are  assigned  to  those  schools \nin  which  it  is  to  provide  a  student  population \npos~ible \nwhich  is  at  least  60  per cent  white.\"  (Plan,  page  5.) \nco \nQ \n\"In  determining  the  initial  attendance  lines,  the  ratio \nof  black  to  white  students  will  not  exceed  60%  white-\nblack  \\\\THERE  THE  SCHOOL  DESEGREGATED.\" \n4070 \nIS \n(Report,  page  5.) \no \n\"A  \"majority  of  the  Board  of  Ed'ucation  believes  that \nthe  constitutional  requirements  of  desegre.gation  will \nbe  achieved  by  the  of  attendance  lines, \nrestruct~tring \nthe  restricting  freedom  of  transfer,  and  other  provi \nsions  of  this  plan.  The.  majority  of  the  Board  has, \ntherefore,  discarded  further  consideration  of  pairing, \ngrouping,  clustering and transporting.\"  (Plan, page 6.) \nThe  strongest  claim  made  in  the  plan  with  respect  to \nthe  all-black  schools  is  that  among  43  elementary  schools \nin  the  densely  populated  areas  of  Charlotte  it is  ((theoreti \nca.lly  [school  board's  emphasis]  possible  to  populate  these \nschools  with  the  following  ratios  of  black  students:  . . .  \nSeven  (7)  schools  in  which  the  black  student  population \nis  100  pel·  cent.\"  (Plan,  pages  3  and  4.)  Since  the  100% \nblack elementary schools  in  the system  (Billingsville, Marie \nDavis,  Double  Oaks,  First  Ward,  Lincoln  Heights,  Oak \nlawn  and  University  Park)  number  exactly  seven,  this \nlanguage  obdously  proposes  that  these  seven  schools  will \nremain  all-black. \nThe  plan  contains  no  factual  information  nor  estimate \nregarding  plans  for  desegregation  of  the  31  other  elemen-\n\n,. \n- - - - - -\n95a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  December \n1,  1969 \ntary  schools,  the  20  junior  high  schools,  and  the  10  senior \nhigh  schools  in  the  system. \nConcerning  faculty  desegregation  the  plan  says: \n\"Du.ring  the  1970-71  school  year,  the  Board  of  Educa \ntion  will  staff  each  school  that  the  faculty  at  each \n80 \nschool  will  be  predominantly  white  and,  'Where  practi \ncable  will  reflect  the  ratio  of  white  and  black  teachers \nemployed  in  the  total  faculty  of  the  school  system.\" \n(Plan,  page  7.) \nWith  regard  to  the  physical  facilities,  the  court  on \nAugust  15,  1969,  ordered  the  defendants  to  produce  by \nNovember  17  \"A  detailed  report  showing,  complete  with \nfigures  and maps,  the  location  and  nature  of  each construc \ntion  project  proposed  or  under  way,  and  the  effect  this \nproject  may  reasonably  be  expf!cted  to  have  upon  the  pro \ngram  of  desegregating  the  schools.\"  In  response  to  that \norder,  the  plan  lists  the  nameo;  of  21  out  of  91  projects, \n• \nexpresses  a  few  opinions  and  conclusions  about  the  huild \ning  program,  and  promises  a  partial  study by  February 1, \n1970  and  a  \"general  long  range  study\"  \"bJJ  June  of  1970,\" \nbut  it  sheds  no  factual  light  on  the  effect  of  any  part  of \nthe  building  program  on  the  segregation  issue.  Since  the \nboard  has,  in  seven  months,  failed  to  produce  a  program \nfor  desegregation,  it  is  only  natural  that  they  can  not \npredict tbe  effect of any  particular  building project on  such \na  program.  The  court  has  yet  not  received  infOl'mation \nnecessary  to  appraise  the  effects  of  current  building \nactivity  on  the  current  unprogrammed  course  of  desegre \ngation. \nit \nWhen  the  plan  is  understood,  boils  down  to  this: \nI t  \n1.  proposes  to  re-draw  school  zone  lines,  and  to \nrestrict freedom  of choice,  which  the  court had  already \n\n96a \nOpi.nion  and  Order  d.ated \n1,  1.969 \nDece~nber \nadvised  the  board  to  eliminate  except  where  it  would \npromote  desegregation.  I t  states  definable  desegre \n110 \ngation  goals. \n2.  The  \"60-40\"  ratio  is  a  one-way  street.  The  plan \nimplies that there will  be  no  action  to produce  desegre \ngation  in  schools  with  blncJ.:  populations  above  40%, \nand  that  no  white  students  arc  to  be  assigned  to  such \nschools. \n3.  Continued  operation  of  all  seven  of  the  all-black \n\" \nelementary schools  would  be  assure-d.  The  same  would \nappear  to  be  true  for  the  entire  group  of  25  mostly \n\"black\"  schools,  mentioned  in  the  court's  November  7 \norder,  which  serve  16,197  of  the  24,714  black  students \nin  the  system . \n• \n4.  Transportation  to  aid  children  transferring  out \nof  segregated  situations  (which  was  ordered  by  the \ncourt  April  23  as  a  condition  of  any  freedom  of \n011 \ntransfer  plan,  and  which  was  a.  part  of  this  plan  as \nadvertised  in  the  boa,rd's  October  report)  has  been \n29 \neliminated  from  the  plan  as  filed  with  the  court. \nInevitable  effects  of  this  action  would  be  to  violate \nthe  court  order  and  to  leave  the  children  recently  re \nassigned  from  seven  closed  hlack  inner-city  schools \nwith  no  way  to  reach  the  suburban  schools  they  now \nattend!  This  is  re-segregation. \n5.  Other  methods  (pairing,  grouping; clustering  of \nschools)  which could  reduce  or eliminate  segregation. \nand  which  the  board, on October  29  when  i t  was  asking \nfor  a  time  extension,  promised  to  consider  have  now \nbeen  expressly  left  out  of  the  plan. \n6.  No  time  is  set.  to  complete  the  job  of faculty  and \npupil  desegregation. \n\n97a \nOpinion  and  Ordcr  cia.ted  December \n1,  1969 \n7.  In  the  written  argument  (\"Report\")  filed  with \nthe  plan,  'with  the  candor  characteristic  of  excellent \nattorneys,  the  board's  attorneys  say: \n\"It  is  importunt  that  the  COllrt  does  not  construe \nthe  information  submitted  in  the  plan  relating \nto  racia1  rat.ios  of  e1ementary  schools  as  being \nin  the  of  a  guarantee  by  the  Board  since \n]1atlln~ \nit  is  anticipated  the  of  restructuring  the \nrr~sults \nattendance  lincs  may  produce  a  greater  lesser \nat' \n• \ndegree  of  dcscgrcgotio'n,  the  extent  of  which  can \n·not  be  at  this  tim.e/'  (Heport,  page  4; \n(frdennined \nemphasis  added.) \n• \nThe  defendants  have  the  burden  to  desegregate  the \nschools  and  to  show  any plan  propose will  desegregate \nthl~y \nthe  controls.  They  ha ve  not.  carried  that  burden.  Re-draw \ning school  zone  lines  won't eliminate  segregation  unless  the \nto  desegregate  has  first  been  made. \ndCClf'iOIl \nTHE  SCHOOLS  ARE  STILL  SEGREGATED \nThe  extent  t.o  which  the  schouls  rc  still  segregated  was \nH \nillustrated  by  the  information  set  out  in  previous  orders \nincluding  t.he  order  (If  November  7,  1969.

Until  unlawful  segregation  is  eliminated,  it  is  idle \nto  speculate  whether  some  of  this  gap  can  be  charged  to \nracial  differences  or  to  \"socio-economic-cultural\"  lag. \n\n• \n• \n• \n--\n• \n• \n-\n.. \nI f   the  courts  should  accept  the  defendants'  contention  t h a t   a l l  \nthey \nl i n e s   a \nhave  t o   do  i s   re-draw  atrendance  and  allow  tv.De  o f   freedom \n\"t;lW1Q  DJ.aCJ(  J. :>0«:3-0:; \n~'ff  ~n \nu  - - \"  - - . \"   -\n\". \nAVERAGE  ACHIEVEMENT  TEST  SCORES.

'rhe  Court  recalled \nprior  decisions  that  segregation  of  graduate  students  was \nunlawful  because  it  restricted  the  student's  \"ability  to \nstudy,  to  engage  in  discussions  and  exchange  views  with \nother  students,  and,  in  general,  to  learn  his  profession.\" \nThe  Court  said: \n\"Such  considerations  apply  with  added  force  to  chil \ndren  in  grade  and  high  schools.  To  separate  them \nfrom  others  of  similar  age  and  qualifications  solely \nbecause  of  their  race  generates  a  feeling  of  inferiority \nas  to  their  status  in  the  community  that  may  affect \ntheir  hearts  and  minds  in  a  way  unlikely  ever  to  be \nundone.\" \nQuoting  a  lower  court  opinion,  the  Supreme  Court  con \ntinued: \n\"'Segregation  of  white  and  colored  children  in  public \nschools  has  a  detrimental  effect  upon  the  colored  chil \ndren.  The  impact  is  greater  when  it  has  the  sanction \nof  the  law;  for  the  policy  of  separating  the  races  is \nusually  interpreted  as  denoting  the  inferiority  of  the \nNegro group.

On  the  facts  in  this  record  and  with  this  background \nof  de  jure  segregation  extending  full  fifteen  years  since \nBrown \nI,  this  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  all  the  black  and \npredominantly  black  schools  in  the  system  are  illegally \nsegregated,  Green  v.

That  desegregation  of  faculty  he  accomplished,  as \npreviously ordered, by assigning faculty  (specialized faculty \npositions  excepted)  so  that  the  ratio  of  black  and  white \nfaculty  members  of  each  school  shall  be  appr'oximately  the \nsame  as  the  ratio  of  black  and  white  faculty  members \nthroughout  the  system. \n4.  That teachers  be  assigned  so  that the  competence  and \nexperience  of teachers  in  formerly  or recently black schools \nwill  not  be  inferior  to  those  in  the  formerly  or  recently \nwhite  schools  in  the  system. \n5.  That  no  school  he  operated  with  an  all-black  or  prc \ndominantly  black  student  body. \n6.  That  pupils  of  all  grades  he  assigned  in  sllch  a  way \nthat as  nearly as  practicable  the  various  schools  at various \ngrade  levels  have  about  the  same  proportioll  of  black  and \nwhite  students. \n7.  That  transportation  he  offered  on  a  uniform  non \nracial  basis  to  all  children  whose  attendance  in  any  school \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n.  -\n• \n1l7a \nOrder  dated  Fcb-ruary \n5,  1.970 \nis  necessary  to  bring  about  the  reduction  of  segregation, \nand  who  live  farther  from  the  school  to  which  they  are \nassigned  than  the  Board determines  to  he  walking dist.ance. \nEstimates  of  the  number  of  children  who  may  have  to  he \ntransported  have  run  as  high  as  10,000  or more.  Since  tho \ncost  to  the  local  system  is  about  or  a  year  per \n$18  $20 \npupil,  lind  the  cost  to  the  state  in  those  areas  where  the \nstate  provides  transportation  funds  is  about  another  $18 \nor $20 a  year per pupil,  the  average  cost for  transportation \nis  apPHl'cntly  less  per  pupil  per  year.  The  local \nthan  $40 \nI t  \nschool  budget  is  about $45,000,000  a  year.  would  appear \nthat  transporting  10,000  additional  children,  if  tlw.t  is \nnecessary,  and  if  the  defendants  had  to  pay  it  all,  would \nadd  less  tuan  one  pel'  cent to  the  local  cost  of  operating the \nschools.  The  significant  point,  however,  is  that  the  cost  is \nnot  a  valid  legal  reason  for  continued  denial  of  constitu \ntional rights. \nThat  are  used \n8.  if  geogmphic  zones  in  making  school \nassignments,  the  parts  of  a  zone  need  not  be  contiguous, \n9.  That  the  defendants  a  continuing  control \nmaintRin \nover  the  race  of  children  in  each  school,  just  as  was  done \nfor  many  decades  before  B-rown  v.  of  Educatio'lI, \nBO(lnl \nand  maintain  the  racial  make-up  of  each  school  (including \nany  new  and  any  re-opened  schools)  to  prevent  any  school \nfrom  becoming  racially  identifiable. \n10.  That  \"freedom  of  choice\"  or  \"freedom  of  transfer\" \nmay  not be  allowed  by  the  Board  if  the  effect  of  any  given \ntransfer  or  group  of  transfers  is  to  increase  the  degree  of \nsegregation  in  the  school  from  which  the  transfer  is  re \nquested  or in  the  school  to  which  the  tmllsfer  is  desired. \n\nU8a \nOrder  dated  February \n5, 1970 \n11.  That  the  Board  retain  its  statutory  power  and  duty \nto  make  assignments  of  pupils  for  administrative  reasons, \nwith  or  without  requests  from  parents.  Administrative \ntransfers  shall  not  be  made  if  the  result  of  such  transfers \nis to  restore or increase  the degree  of segregation  in either \nthe  transferor  or  the  transferee  school. \n12.  That  if  transfers  are  sought  on  grounds  of  \"hard \nship,\"  race  will  not  be  a  valid  basis  upon  which  to  demon \nstrate  \"hardship.\" \n13.  That  the  Board  adopt  and  implement  a  continuing \nprogram,  computerized  or  otherwise,  of  assigning  pupils \nand  teachers  during  the  school  year  as  well  as  at the  start \nof each year for  the  conscious  purpose of maintaining each \nschool  and  each  faculty  in  a  condition  of  desegregation. \n14.  That  the  defendants  report  to  the  court  weekly  be \ntween  now  and  May  15,  1970,  reporting  progress  made  in \ncompliance  with  tbis  ordeI';  and  that they  report  tberea£tel' \non  July  15,  August  15,  September  15  and  November  1, \n1970,  and  on  FebrUluy  1  and  May  1,  1971. \n5.  That  the  inte1'11al  operation  of  eacb  school,  and  the \nassignment  and management of school  employees, of course \nbe  conducted  on  a  lion-racial,  non-discriminatory  basis. \n16.  The  duty  imposed  by  the  law  alld  by  this  order  is \nthe  desegregation  of  schools  and  the  maintenance  of  that \ncondition.  The  plans  discussed  in  this  order,  whether  pre \npared by Board and  staff or by outside consultants,  such  as \ncomputer  expert, 111'.  John W. 'Veil, or Dr.  John  A.

Although  the  Board  junior  high  school  plan  is \nit \ninferior  in  design  and  results  to  Fingcr's  plan,  is  a \nDl', \npurely  \"home  grown\"  product  and  the  court  would  like \nto  approve:  it,  if it can  he  brought  illto  compliallce  with  law \nby  desegregating  Piedmont  Junior  HiglJ  School,  and  by \nadding  transportation  as  aboye  indicated,  and  by  increas \ning  the  black  attendance  at  several  outlying  schools.  1'ho \nBoard may jf it wishes  consider  (1)  I'C-ZOnillg;  (2)  two-wo)\" \ntran;:;porting  of  pupils  between  outlying  schools  and  Pied-\n1I10nt;  (3)  closing  Piedmont  and  assigning  the  pupils  to \nAlbemarle  Road,  Cnrmel,  McClintock  amI  Quail  Hollow. \nUnless  the  court  has  becn  notified  ill  writing  by  noon  of \nFebruary  6,  1970,  of  an  affirmative  decision  adopting  one \nof  these  ehoice:::.  by  formal  Board  actioll,  the  junior  high \nschools  al'e  directed  to  be  desegregated  according  to  Dr. \nFinger's  plan,  as  illllstrated  hy  exhibits  E  and  F. \n20.  The  Board's  plan  for  clemcnta  schoo Is,  ill ustrll ted \n1')' \nby  exhibits  G  and  H,  cannot  he  approved  because  (I)  it \nretains  nine  schools  83%  to  100%  black,  serving  over  Laif \nthe  black  elementary  pupils,  and  (2)  it  leaves  approxi \nmately  half  the  31,500  white  elementary  students  atte11cling \nschools  that  are  86%  to  100ro  white;  and  (3)  it  promises \nto  provide  little  or  trallsportation  in  aid  of  desegrega \n110 \ntion,  evcll  though  the  plan's  zoncs  in  some  cases  are  ap \nparently  five  or  six  miles  long.  The  Board  plan  for  ele \nmelltaries  openly  rejects  the  duty  to  eliminate  all  the \nblack  schools. \nThe  Finger plan  uses  many  of the  same  basic  attendance \nlines  as  the  Board  plan;  however,  it.  does  1I0t  stop  short  of \n\n-\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n. \n121a \nOrder  dated  Febntary  5,  1970 \nthe constitutional  requirements, and by pairing and  cluster \ning  groups  of  schools  it  achieves  full  desegregation  of  the \nelementary  schools.  The  school  staff  worked  out  the  de-\n• \ntails  of  this  plan  and  are  familial'  with  it.  Its  attendance \nI; \nzones  are  illustrated  on  the  map,  exhibit  its  elementary \n• \nschool  populations  are  listed  in  exhibit  J;  and  the  pairing \nand  gl'Ouping  of  the  outlying  and  inner-city  schools,  grade \nby grade,  are  shown  in  detail  on  exhibit  K.  Subject  to  the \nqualifications  previously  stated,  the  Board  is  directed  to \nfollow  the l!-'inger  plan with reference to  elementary schools. \n21.  Deadlines  to  complete  yurious \nTHE  TlME  rrABLE: \nphases of the program required  in  this  order are as follows: \nHIGH  Seniors  may  remain  in  their \nSENIOR  SCHOOLS. \npresent  schools  until  the  end  of  the  school  the \n~Tear; \nBoard  may  make  any  decision  they  deem  wise  about \nallowing  seniors  to. transfer  before  graduation  to \nschools  where  their  race  will  be  in  the  minority.  Ele'v \nenth and  tenth graders  will  be  transferred to  their new \nschools  not  later  than  the  4th  day  of  May,  1970. \nHIGH  SCHOOLS  (Grades  7,  8,  9).  Complete \nJUNIOR \ndesegregation  shall  be  accomplished  not  later  than  the \n1st day  of  April,  1970. \nFACULTY.  Complete  desegregation  of  the  various \nfaculties  shall  be  accomplished  by  the  various  times \nset  out  above  for  desegregation  of  the  student  bodies. \n22.  MODIFICATIONS.  The intent.ion  of  this  order  is  to  put \non  the  Board  the full  duty  to  bring the  schools  into  compli \nance  with  the  Constitution  as  above  outlined,  but  to  leave \nmaximum  discretion  in  the  Board  to  choose  methods  that \nwill  accomplish  the  required  result.  However,  it is  directed \n\n122a \nOrder  dated  February  5,  1970 \nthat  leave  of  court  be  obtained  before  making  any  material \ndeparture  from  any  specific  reqnirement  set  out  herein. \nThe  court  will  undertake  to  rule  promptly  on  any  such \nrequests  for  deviation  from  prescribed methods. \n23.  The  comt  claims  no  infallibility  and  does \nAPPEAL.  . .  \nnot  seek  to  prevent  appeal  from  all  or  any  part  of  this \norder,  and  allow  the  making  of  any  record  needed  to \nwill \npresent  appeal  any  contention  the  parties  desire  to \nOIl \nmake,  and  will  do  what  this  court  can  to  expedite  such \nappeal.  However, in accordance with Whi.ttenberg v.  G-reen \nville,  supra.,  this  order  will  not  be  stayed  pending  appeal, \nand  immediate  steps  to  begin  compliance  are  directed. \nAll  evidence  in  the  cause  and  all  findings  and  con \n24. \nclusions  in  previous  orders  which  support  or  tend  to  sup \nport  this  order  are  relied  upon  in  support  of  this  order. \n25.

That  transportation  be  offered  on  a  lmiform \nnon-racial  basis  to  all children whose  attendance  ill  any \nsellOol  is necessary to  bring about  the  reductiOll  of seg \nregation,  and  who  live  farther  from  the  school  to \nwhich  they  are  assigned  than  the  Board  determines  to \nthe \nbe  walking  distance.  Estimates  of  number  of  chil \ndren who  may have  to  be  transported  have  run as high \nas  10,000  or  more.\" \nSince  February  5,  estimates  have  been  made  by  defen \ndants  that  paragraph  7  would  l'equire  transporting  more \nthan 23,000 pupils rather than 10,000 to  14,000,  as estimated \nat  the  hearing.  Upon  reviewing  the  evidence  i.ntroduced \nsince  that  hearing,  it  appears  that  these  higher  estimates \nmay  be  based  on  construing  the  above  language  of  para \ngraph  7  so  as  to  require  an  offer  of  transportation  to  all \n1% \nchildren  who  live  more  than  miles  from  their  school, \nincluding  city  children  who  are  not  now  entitled  to  tran \nsportation.  These,  according to  the  testimony,  may nnto bel' \nas  many  as  13,000. \nThe  court  regrets  any  lack  of  clarity  in  the  order  which \nmay  have  given  rise  to  this  interpretation.  Paragraph  7 \n• \nwas  never  intended  to  require  transportation  beyond  that \nnow  provided  by  law  for  city  children  who  are  not  re \nassigned,  nor  for  those  whose  reassif,'Tlments  are  not  re \nquired  by  the  desegregation  program. \nAccordingly,  paragraph  7  of  the  February  5,  1970  order \nis amended by deleting the words  \"attendance in  any school\" \nand  insert.ing  the  words  \"reassignment  to  nny  school,\"  in \ntbe  first  sentence. \nThis  the  3rd  day  of :March,  1970. \n/s/  B.

Paragraph  seven  of this  court's  order  of  February  5, \n1970,  as  amended,  reads: \n\"7.  That  transportation  be  offered  on  a  uniform \nnon-racial  basis  to  all  children  whose  reassignment \nto  any  school  is  necessary  to  bring  about  the  reduc \ntion  of  segregation,  and  who  live  farther  from  the \nschool  to  which  they  are  assig'ned  than  the  Board \ndetermines  to  be  walking  distance.  Estimates  of  the \nnumber  of  children  who  may  have  to  be  transported \nhave  rUll  as  high  as  10,000  or  more.  Since  the  cost \nto  the  local  system  is  about $18  or 20  a  year  per pupil, \nand  the  cost  to  the  state  in  those  areas  where  the \nstate  provides  transportation  funds  is  about  another \n$18  or  $20  a  year  per  pupil,  the  average  cost  for \n$40 \ntransportation  is  apparently  less  than  per  pupil \nper year.  The  local  school  budget  is  about  $45,000,000 \nIt \na  year.  would  appear  that  transporting 10,000  addi \ntional  children,  if  that  is  necessary,  and  if  the  defen \ndants  had  to  pay  it  all,  would  add  less  than  one  per \ncent  to  the  local  cost  of  operating  the  schools.  The \nsignificant  point,  however,  is  that  cost  is  not  a  valid \nlegal  reason  for  continued  denial  of  constitutional \nrights.\" \n2.  A  bird's-eye  picture  of  the  indispensable  position  of \nthe  sehool  bus  in  public  education  in  North  Carolina,  and \nespecially  in  the  school  life  of  grades  one  through  six  (ele \nmentary  students)  is  contained  in  a  summary  by  the  de-\n\n137a \nSupplerncntal  Fi'/Idings  of  Fact  daled  March \n21,  1970 \nfendal1t  Dr.  Craig  Phillips  entitled \n\"RIDING  THE  SCHOOL \n(Plajntiffs'  Exhibit  15),  published  January  1,  1970, \nBUSES\" \nwhich  reads  as  follows: \n\"The  average  school  bus  transported  66  students  each \nday  during  the  1968-69  school  year;  madc  1.57  trips \nper  day,  12.0  miles  in  length  (onc  way);  transported \n48.5  students  per bus  trip,  including  students  who  were \ntransported  from  elementary  to  high  schools. \n\"During  the  1968-69  school  year: \n610,760  pupils  transported  to  public  schools  by \nW(~l'e \nthe  State \n• \n54.9  percent  of  the  total  public  school  average  daily \nattendance  was  transported \npercent  were  elementa1'Y  st-ude.nts \n70.9 \n29.1  percent  were  high  school  students \n3.5  students  were  loaded  (average)  each  111ile  of  bus \ntravel \nThe  total  cost  of  school  transportation  was  $14,293,-\n272.80,  including  replacement  of  buses:  The  average \ncost,  including  the  replacement  of buses,  was  $1,541.05 \nper  bus  for  the  school  year  181  days;  $8.51  per  bus \nper day  $23.40  per  student for  the  school  year  $.1292 \nj  j \nper student per day;  and  $.2243  per bus mile  of opera \ntion.\"  (Emphasis  added.) \nMecklenburg  County,  the  average  daily  number  of \nIII \n. pupils  currently  transported  on  state  school  busses  is  ap \nproximately  23,600-pllls  anotber  5,000  wbose  fares  are \npaid  on  the  Charlotte  City  Coach  Lines. \n\n13Ba \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \n3.

The  1969-70  budget  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nschool  system  is  $57,711,344,  of  which  nearly  $51,000,000 \nrepresents operational  expense  and  between  $6,000,000  and \n$7,000,000  represents  capital  outlay  and  debt  service. \nThese  funds  come  from  federal,  state  and  county  sources, \nas  follows: \nFEDERAL  STATE  COUNTY  TOTAL \n$2,450,000  $29,937,044  $25,324,300  $57,711,344 \nThe construction of school  buildings is not included in  these \nbudget  figures  (see  Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  6). \n7.  State  expenditures in  the  past  ten  years  have  usually \nnot  equalled  appropriations.  There  has  been  a  sizeable \noperating  surplus  in  the  state  budget  for  every  biennium \nsince  1959-60  (State  Budget,  page  86). \n8.  The  state  superintendent  of  public  instruction  in  his \nbiennial  report  (Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  12)  for  the  years  1966-\n68  recommended  that  \"city  transportation  should  be  pro-\n\n140a \nSu,pplerncntal  Findillgs  of  Fact  dated  March  21,  1970 \nvided on  the  same basis as  transportation  for  rural  children \nas  a  matter  of  equity.\" \n9.  The 1969  report  of the  Governor's  Study  Commission \non  the  Public  School  System  of  North  Carolina  (Plaintiffs' \nExhibit  13)  recommellded  that  transportation  be  provided \nfor  all  school  ch.ildren,  city  as  welI  as  rural,  on  an  equal \nbasis.  Signatory  to  that  report  was  one  of  the  present  de \nfendants,  the  state  superintendent  of  public  instruetiOll. \n10.  The  basic support.  for  the  public  schools  of  the  state \ncomes  from  the  State  Legislature. \n11.  Some  5,000  children  travel  to  and  from  school  in \nMecklenhurg  County  each  day  in  busses  provided  by  con \ntract  carriers  such  as  Charlotte  City  Coach  Lines,  Inc. \n(Morgan's  deposition  of  February  25,  1970,  page  36). \n12.  Upon  the  basis  of data  furnished  by  the  school board \nand  on  the  basis  of  statistics  from  the  National  Safety \nCouncil,  it  is  found  as  a  fact  that  travel  hy  sehool  bus  is \nsafer  than  walking  or  than  riding  in  private  vehicles. \n13.  Traffic  is  of  course  heavy  all  over  the  540  square \nmiles  of  the  county.  Motor  vehicle  registration  fo!'  1969 \nwas  191,165  motor  vehicles  (161,678  automobiles  and  29,487 \ntrucks). \n14.  IVlany  children  eligible  for  transportation  do  not  ac \ncept  that  transportation.  Estimates  have  been  made  that \nthis  number of those  who  do  not accept  transportation is  in \nthe  neighborhood  of  50%  of  those  who  arc  eligible. \n\n141a \n81LppienwIllal  Findi'llps  of  Fact  da[.ed  March \n21,  1970 \n15.  Approximately  5,000  child ron  in  the  system  attend \nschool  outside  the  school  ZOllO  ill  which  t.hey  reside.  Al \nthough  requested  of  the  defendants  hy  the  court  on  Murch \n7,  1970,  information  as  to  whore  these  childrell  go  to  school \nhas not  been forthcoming  Hllcl  the  defendants have  indicated \nthat  it  is  impos:sible  to  produce  it. \n16.  As  the  transportation  regulatioJlsl.'  are  under \n~tate \nstood  hy  the  cOllrt,  the state will  bear  its  share  (about  half) \nof  transportation  co:sts  for  children  who  live  more  than \nI1h \nmiles  from  thei  school,  as follows: \nI' \n(a)  All  I'llral  children,  wherever  they  attend  school; \n(b)  Ali  perimeter  children  (those  living  in  territory \nannexed  by  the  city  hefore  1957),  wherever  they \nattend  school;  a1ld \n(c)  All  inner city children  assigned  to  schools  in  either \nthe  perimeter  t.he  rural  of  the  system. \n01'  ~1reas \n17.  The  defendants  submitted  information  on  the  num \n1Jh \nber  of  children  who  live  within  miles  of  the  schools \nwhich  are  to  he  desegregated  by  zoning.  This  information \nshows  that  East  1Iecklenhurg,  Independence,  North  Meck \nlenburg,  Olympic,  South  Mecklenhurg  and  West  lVIecklen \nhUl'g  high  schools,  and  Qua il  Hollow  and  Alexander  junior \nhigh  schools,  with  total  student  populations  of  12,184,  have \nin  the  aggregato  only  96  studCllts  who  live  within  IV::!  miles \nfrolll  the  schools.  Some  12,088  then  are  eligible  for  trans \nportation.  These  same  schools  among  them  provide  bus \ntransportation  for  5,349  students.  This  information  illus \ntrates  the  of  bus  one  of  the \nimportance  the  as  essential \n..  General  Statutes  of  Nurth  Carolina,  Chapter  115,  §180-192. \n\n142a \nSu.pplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nelements  in  the  whole  plan  of  operation  of  the  schools.  I t  \nalso  shows  the wide gap between  those  entitled  to  transpor \ntation  and  those  who  actually  claim  it.  There  is  no  black \nschool  ill  the  system  which  depends  very  much  upon  the \nschool  bus  to  get  the  children  to  school.  The  total  nnmber \nof  children  transported  in  October,  1969,  to  schools  identi \nfiable  as  black was  541  out of total  population  in  those  black \nschools  of  over  17,000.  Black  schools,  including  the  new \nblack  schools,  have been located  in  black areas where busses \nwould  be  unnecessary.  Subnrban  schOOls,  including  the \nnewest ones,  have  been  located far away from  black centers, \nand  where  they can  not  be  reached  by  many  students  with \nout transportation. \n18.  Bus  travel  in  both  urban  and  rural areas  takes  time. \nAn  analysis  of  the  records  of  bus  transportation,  based \nupon  the  reports  of  school  principals,  is  contained  in  the \nextensive  exhibits  bearing  Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  numbers  22, \n33,  24,  25,  26  and  27.  For  the  month  of  October,  1969,  by \nway  of  illustration,  these  principals' reports  when  analyzed \nshow  that out of some  279  busses ca rrying more than  23,000 \nchildren both  ways  each day: \nThe  average  one  way  trip  is  one  hour  and  fourteen \nminutes \ni \n80%  of  the  busses  require  more  than  one  hour  for  a \n• \none  way  tnp; \n75%  of  the  busses  make  two  or  more  trips  each  day; \nAverage  miles  traveled  by  busses  making  one  round \ntrip  per  day  is  34Ij:!;  and \nAverage  bus  mileage  per  day  for  busses  making  two \ntrips  is  47.99. \n\n.. \n-\n.  .. \nU3a \n8'llP1Jlem.en/.al  Findings  of  Fact,  dated  March \n21,  1P70 \n19.  It was  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Self and  DI·.  Finger,  and \nthe  courts  finch  as  a  fact,  that  transportation  provided  by \nthe  school  board's  plans,  which  include  narrow  corridors \nseveral  miles  long  in  places  only  one-half  mile  wide, \nillld \nproceeding  in  straight  lines  diagonally  across  streets  and \nother  obstacles,  would  be  more  expensive  capita  than \npCI' \ntransportation  under  the  satellite  zone  plan.  The  court \nplan  calls  for  pick-ups  to  be  marle  at  a  few  points  in  each \nscbool  district,  as  testified  to  by  Dr.  Self,  and  for  non-stop \nruns  to  be  mac.1e  between  satellite  ZOlles  and  principal zones. \nThere  will  be  no  serious  extra  load  on  downtown  traffic  be \ncause  therc  will  be  no  pick-up  and  discbarge  of  passengers \nin  downtowll  traffic  areas. \n20.  The court -finds  that from  the  standpoint  of  distance \ntl'avelled,  time  en  route  and  inconvenience,  the  children \nbussed  pursuant  to  the  court  order  will  not  as  a  group \ntravel  as  far,  nor  will  they  experience  more  inconvenience \nthan  the  more  than  28,000  children  who  are  already  being \ntransported  at state  expense. \nOn \n21.  July  29,  1969  (pUl'suant  to  the  court's  April  23, \n1969  order  that  they  frame  a  plan  for  desegregation  and \nthat school  busses  could  be  used as  needed),  the  defendants \nproposed  a  plan  for  closing  seven  inner-city  black  schools \nand  bussing  4,200  students  to  outlying  schools.  The  plan \nwas  approved,  It  had  some  escape  clauses  in  it,  and  the \ndefendants in  practice  added some others; but as  presented, \nand as approved  by the  court,  the  \"freedom  of  choice\"  con \ntemplated  was  very  narrowly  restricted;  and  bussing  of \nseveral  hundred  students  bas  taken  place  under  that  plan. \n22.  Evidence  of  property  valuations  produced  by  the \ndefendants  shows that the  value  of the seven  school  proper-\n\n, \n, \n144a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  19'70 \nties  closed  under  the  July  29,  1969  plan,  and  now  for  the \nmost  part  standing  idle,  was  over  three  million  dollars. \n23.  The  all-black  or  predominantly  black  elementary \n, \nschools  which  the  board  plan  would  retain  in  the  system \nare located in an almost  exclusively Negro  section  of  Char \n, \nlotte,  which  is very  roughly  triangular in  shape  and  meas \nures about four or five  miles  on  a  side.  Some  are air-condi \ntioned and most are modern. Virtually none of their patrons \nnow  ride  busses;  the  schools  were  located  where  the  black \npatrons  were  or  were  expected  to  be.  These  schools,  their \ncompletion  dates,  and  representative  academic  perfor \nmances  of  their  sixth  grade  graduating  classes  are  shown \nin  the  following  table: \n\n\n\n146a \nSupplemental  Fin-dings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21}  1970 \n24.  Both  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  board  staff  appear \nto  have  agreed,  and  the  court  finds  as  a  fact,  that  for  the \npresent  at  least,  there  is  no  way  to  desegregate  the  a11-\nblack  schools  in  Northwest  Charlotte  without providing  (or \ncontinuing to provide)  bus or other t.ransportatiou for  thou \nsands  of  children.  .A.ll  plans  and  all  variations  of  plans \nconsidered  for  this  purpose  lead  in  one  fashion  or  another \nto  that  conclusion. \n25.  In  the  court's  order  of  April  23,  1969,  a  suggestion \nwas  made  that  the  board  seek  consultation  assistance \n01' \nfrom  the  office  of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare.  The \nboard  refused  to  do  tbis,  and  as  far  as  the  court  knows \nbas  not  sought  belp  fl'om  HEW. \n26.  Some  600  or  more  pupils  transfer  from  one  scbool \nto  another  or  register  for  the  first  time  into  the  system \nduring  the course  of  each  month  of  the  typical  school  year. \nI t  is  the  assignment  of  these  childl'cn  which  is  the  particu \nlar  subject  of  the  reference  in  paragraph  13  of  the  order \nto  the  malmer  of  handling  assignments  within  the  school \nyear. \n27.  No  plan for  the complete desegregation of the  schools \nwas  available  to  the  court  until  the  appointment  of  Dr. \nJohn  A.  FingcI',  Jr.  and  the  completion  of  his  tactful  and \neffective  work  with  the  school  administrative  staff  in  De \neember  1969  and  January  1970.

Hearings  on  the  \"Finger\"  plans  and  on  the  board's \nproposed  plans  were  conducted  on  February  2  and  Febru \nary  5,  1970.  These  plans  may  best  be  understood  if  they \narc  considered  in  four  divisions: \n29.  The  plan  for  senior high  schools . . uThe  plan  ordered \nto  be  put  into  effect  May  4,  1970  is  the  board's  own  plan \ndesegregation  of  the  sellior  high  schools  in  all  pal'ticu \nfOl' \nlars  except  that  the  order  calls  for  the  assignment  to \nIndependence  High  School  of some  300  black  children.  The \nhoard contends the high  school  plans  will  call  for  additional \ntransportation for 2,497  students and  will  require 69  busses. \nThe court  is  unable  to  accept  this  view  of  the  evidence.  All \ntransportation  undel'  both  the  board  and  t.he  court  plan \n, \nis  COV(lred  by  state  law. \n30.  The  plan {01'  :;unior  high schools.  A  plan  for  junior \nhigh  schools  was  prepared  by  the  board  staff  and  Dr. \nFinger  and  was  submitted  to  the  court  as  Dr.  Finger's \nplan.  The  board  submitted  a  separate  plan.  Both  plans \nused  the  technique  of  re-zoning.  The  school  board's  plan \nafter  all  of  their  Te-zoning  had  been  done  left  Piedmont \n.Junior  High  School  9070  black  and  shifting  towards  100% \nblack.  The  plan  designed  by  Dr.  Finger  with  staff  assist \nance  included  zoning  in  such  a  way  as  to  desegregate  all \nthe  school!';.  This  zoning  wa!';  aided  by  a  technique  of \n\"satellite\"  districts.  For  example,  black  students  from \nsatellite  districts  in  the  central  city  area  around  Piedmont \nCourts  will  he  assigned  to  Alexander  Graham  Junior  High, \n\n148a \nSupplemental  of  Pact  dated \nPindinf}S  21,  1970 \n~llarch \nwhich is predominantly white.  Black :-;tudents fl'oll1  the area \naround  Northwest  Junior  High  School  (aU-black)  win  be \nsimilarly  transferred  to  Wilson  .Junior  High,  northwest  of \nthe  air  port.  These  one-way  transfers,  essentially  identical \nin  nature  to  the  board's  July  29,  1969  plalJ,  will  result  in \nthe  substantial desegregation  of all  the  junior  high  schools, \nwhich  are  left  under  this  plan  witb  black  student  popula \ntions  val·ying from  9%  at .J.  H.  Gunn  to  3370  at  Alexander \nand  Randolph. \nThe  court  order  did  not  require  the  adoptioll  of  the \nFinger  pIal!.  In  paragraph 19  of  the  order  the  board  were \ngiven  four  choices  of  action  to  complete  the  process  of \ndesegrcgating  the  junior  high  schools.  These  choices  were \n(1)  Re-zoning;  (2)  Two-way trallsporting of  pupils between \nPiedmont and  white  schools;  (3)  Closing Piedmont  and  as \nsigning  the  black  students  to  other  junior  high  schools;  or \n(4)  Adoption  of the  Finger  plan. \nThe  board  elected  to  adopt  and  tlid  adopt  the  FingeL' \nplan  by  rcsolution  February  9,  1970. \n011 \nthe \nThe defendants have offered  fig-tlres  on  basis of  which \nthey  ask  the  conrt  to  find  that  4,359  students  will  have  to \nbe  transported  nndor  the  junior  high  school  plan  and  that \n84  busses  will  be  required.  The  conrt  is  unable  to  find  that \nthese  contentions  arc  110me  out  by  the  r-;tatistics  and  other \n• \nevidence  offered. \nDr.  Self,  the  school  superintendent,  and  Dr.  Finger,  the \ncou rt  appOi]lted  expert,  hath  testifiE'd  that  the  tnmsporta \ntion  reCJuired  to implement  the  plan  for  junior  highs  wonld \nhe less expensive and  easier to arrange than  the tI\"aJl:;;porta \ntio11  proposed  nnder  the  hoard  plan.  The  conrt  finds  this \nto  be  a  fact. \nTwo  schools  may  be  nsed  to  illustrate  this  point.  Smith \n.J \nunior  High  under  the  board  plan  would  ha  a  contigl.l-\n\\Oe \n\n149a \nSupplemental  Fi'nciin!ls  of  Pact  dated  J:larch \n21,  1970 \nous  district  six  miles  in  length  extending  4Jj:,,!  miles  north \nfrom  the  school  itself.  The  district  throughout  the  greatcr \nportion  of  its  length  is  one-half  mile  wide  and  all  roads \nin its onc-half mile  width arc diagonal  to  its  borders.  J!:a:;t \nway  .Junior  High  presents  a  shape  somewhat  like  a  large \nwooden  pistol  with  a  fat  handlc  surrounding  the  school \notf  Central  Avenue  in  East  Charlotte  and  with  corridor \n11 \nextending  three  miles  north  and  thcn  extending'  at  right \nallgles  foul'  miles  west  to  draw  studcmts  from  the  Double \nOaks  al'en  in  northwest  eha dotte.  Obviously  piekiug  up \nstudents  ill  llarrow  corl'idors  alOllg  which  110  major  road \npresents  considerable  transportation  prolllem, \nrUlls  a \nThe  Finger  plan  makes  no  unnecessary  effort  to  main \ntain  contiguous  districts,  hut  simply  provides  for  the  send \ning  of  husses  from  compact  inner  city  attendance  zone::;, \n1l011-stop,  to  the  outlying  white  junior  junior  high  schoolS, \nthercb)'  minimizing  transportation  tie-lips  and  makillg  the \npick-up  and  deliver),  of  children  efficient  alld  time-saving, \nIt:  also  is  apparent  that  if  the  board  had  the \n~ought \nminimum  rlepartnrc  from  its  own  plan,  such  minimulIl \n1'0-\n• \nsnit.  could  have  becn  achieved  by  accepting  the \nalt~rnative \nof  tnlllsporting  white  children  into  and  hlack  childron  out \nof  the  Piedmont  school  until  its  racial  characteristics  had \nbeen  elimi na ted. \nIII  summary,  as  to  junior  high  schools,  the  court  filHls \nthat  the  plan  chosen  by  the  board  and  approved  hy  t.he \ncourt  places  no  greater  logistic  personal  hurclen  upon \n01' \nstudents  administrators  than  the  plan  proposed  by \n01'  th(~ \nschool  board;  t.hat  the  transportation  callecl  for  hy  the \napproved  plan  is  not  substantially  greater  than  the  trnn \nsportation  called  for  by  the  bonrd  plan;  that  the  approved \nplnn  will  be  more  economical,  efficient  nnd  cohesive  and \neasier  to  administer  and  will  fit  in  more  nearly  with  the \n\n150a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March  :21, \n1970 \ntransportation  problems  involved  in  desegregating  ele \nmentary  and  senior  high  schools,  and  that  the  board  made \na  correct administrative  and  educational  choice  in  choosing \nthis  plan  instead  of  one  of  the  other  three  methods. \n31.  The  plan,  for  elemenim'Y  schools.  The  elementary \nschool  desegregation  program  is  best  understood  by  divid \ning it into two  parts:  (a)  The 27  schools  being desegregated \nby  zoning;  and  (b)  The  34  schools  being  desegregated  by \ngrouping, pairing and  transportation  hetween  school  zones. \n32.  The  re-zoned  group.  Two  plans  were  submitted  to \nthe  court.  The  school  board  plan  was  prepared  for  the \nboard  by  its  staff.  I t  relied  entirely  upon  zoning  with  the \naid  of  some  computer  data  supplied  by  Mr.  Weil,  a  board \nemployed  consultant.  It  did  as  much  as  could  reasonably \nbe  accomplished  by  re-zoning  school  boundaries.  I t  would \nleave  nine  elementary  schools  83%  to  10070  black.  (These \nschools  now  serve  6,462  students '\"  over  half  the  black  ele \nmentary  pupils.)  I t   would  leave  approximately  half  the \nwhite  elementary students  attending schools  which  are 86% \nto  100%  white.  In  short,  it  does  not  tackle  the  problem  of \nthe  black  elementary  schools  in  northwest  Charlotte. \nThe  \"Finger  plan\"  was  the  result  of  nearly  two  months \nof  detailed  work  and  conference  between  Dr.  Finger  and \nthe  school  administrative  staff.  Dr.  Finger  prepared  sev \neral  plans  to  deal  with  the  problem  within  the  guidelines \nset out in  the December  1,  1969  order.  Like  the  board  plan, \nthe  Finger  plan  does  as  much  by  l'c-zoning  school  atten \ndance  lines  as  can  reasonably  he  accomplished.  However, \nunlike  the  board  plan.  it  does  not  stop  there.  I t  goes  fur \nther and desegregates all  the  rest of  the  elementary  schools \nby  the  technique  of grouping  two  or  three  outlying  schools \nwith  onc  hlack  inner  city  school  by  transporting  black \nj \n\n151a \nFindings  of  Fact  dated  March \n81~pplemental  21,  1970 \nstudeJlts from grades onc through four to  the  outlying white \nand  by  transporting  wbite  students  from  the  fifth \n~chools; \nto \nand  sixth  grades  from  the  outlying  white  schools  the \ninner  city  black  school. \nThe \"Finger plan\"  itself  in  the  form  from  which  in  prin \nciple  the court approved  on  February 5,  1970,  was  prepared \nby  the  sl:hool  staff  and  was  filed  with  the  COUJ't  hy  repre \nsentatives  of  the  board  on  February  2,  1970.  I t  \nSCl1001 \nrepresents  the  combined  thought  of  D,'.  Finger  and  the \nschool administrative staff as to a  valid method for  promptly \ndesegregating  the  elementary  schools,  if  such  desegrega \ntion  is  required  by  law  to  be  accomplished, \nThis  plan  wns  drafted  by  the  staff  and  by  Dr.  Finger \nin  such  a  way  as  to  make  possible  immediate  desegregation \nif  it  should  be  ordered  by  an  appellate  court  in  line  with \nthen  cnrrent  opinions  of  appellate  courts, \nThe  testimony  of  the  school  superintendent,  Dr.  Self, \nwas,  and  the  conrt  finds  as  a  fact,  that  the  zoning  portion \nof the  plan  can  be  implemented  by April  1,  1970  along  edu \ncationally  sOllnd  lines  and  that  the  transportation  problems \npresented  by  the  zoning  portion  of  the  plan  can  he  solved \nwith  available  resources. \nThe  court  has  reviewed  the  statistics  supplied  to  it  by \nthe  original  defendants  with  ,'egaI'd  to  elementary  schools \nto  be  desegregated  by  re.zoning.  These  schools  have  been \nwith  a  ex \nzoned  compact  attendance  areas  and  with  few \nceptions  they  have  no  children  beyond  Ill:.!  miles  distance \nfrom  the school  to which  they  arc  assigned,  Although  some \ntransportation  will  be  required,  the amount  is  not  consider \nable  when  weigherl  against  the  already  existing \ncapacit~, \nsystem.  The  COl11't  that \nof  the  specifically  finds  not  morc \nthan  l,?OO  students  wil]  require  transportation  under  thif; \n• \nportion  of  the  program  and  that  the  hus  trips  would  be  so \n\n152a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated.  March \n21}  1970 \nshort  aud  multiple  hus  so  highly  practical  that \n10 \n1'11l1S \nschool  busses  or  less  wil1  be  adequate. \n33.  The  pairing  and  grouping  of  elem.entary  schools. \n34 \n- T h i s   part  of  the  plan  as  previously  described  would \ngroup  an  inner  city  hlack  school  with  two  or  more  outly \nillg  white  schools  and  assign  cbilJren  back  and  forth  be \ntween  the  two  so  that  desegregated  fifth  and  si.xth  grades \nwould  be  established  in  the  presently  black  schools  and  de \nsegregated  grades  one  through  four  would  be  established \nin  the  presently  white  schools.  The  estimate  of  Dr.  Finger \nand  Dr.  Self,  the  superintendent,  was  that  this  program \nwould  require  transporting  roughly  white  pupils  of \n;),000 \nfifth  and  sixth  grade  levels  into  inner  city  schools.  The \nboard  in  its  latest  estimate  puts  the  total  figure  at  10,206 . \n.T  nst  what  is  the  net  additional  number  of  students  to  be \nt.ransported  who  are  not  already  receiving  transportation \nis  open  to  considerable  question. \n34.  The  Disco·unt  Factors.·  The  court  accepts  at  face \nvalue,  for  the  most  part,  the  defendants'  evidence  of  mat \nters  of  independent  fact,  but  is  unable  to  agree  with  the \nopinions  Or  factual  conclusions  urged  by  counsel  as  to  the \nnumbers  of  additional  children  to  be  transported,  and  as \nto  the  cost  and  difficulty  of  school  bus  transportation.  The \ndefendants  in  their  presentation  have  interpreted  the  facts \nto  suggest  incollvenient  and  expensive  and  burdensome \nviews  of the court's order.  Their figures  must he  diSCOllnted \nin  light  of  various  factors,  all  shown  by  the  evidence,  as \nfollows: \n(a)  Some  children  daily  arc  provided  trans \n5,000 \nportation  on  City  Coach  Lines,  in  addition  to  the \n\n- -\n~------ --~-\n153a \nSupplemental  Fi'J/.di\"ll!]s  of  Fact.  dated  ilIa}\"ch \n21,  1970 \n23,600  and  morc  who  riric  school  busses,  Tuese  have \nnot  been  considered  in  the  defendants'  calculat.ions. \n(b)  Not  all  students eligiblc  for  tl'ansport.atioll  actu \nally  aecept  it.  The  board's  cstimates  of  transportation, \nhowever,  assnme  that  transportat.ion  must  he  provided \ndaily  for  all  eligihle  St.lldeJltS. \n(c)  Not  aU  )'cgistcred  stndellts  attend  all  8ehools \nevery  day.  The  board's  figlll'es  appeal'  to  assume  they \ndo.  Statewide,  average  daily  attendance  is  less  than \n9470  of  initial  registration. \n(d)  The  present  average  nllmber  of  students  trans \nported  trip,  and  from  school,  per  hus,  per \nround  to \nday,  is  mOl'e  than  83.  The  board's  esi:imates,  however, \na re  based  the  assnmption  tuat  they  can  transport \n011 \nonly  44  46  pupils,  round  trip,  per  bus,  per  day \n01' \nwhen  the  hus  serves  a  desegl'egation  role. \nBusses  being  avel'nge \n(0)  now  lHied  make  an  of  1.8 \nt.rips  per  day.  Board  estimates  to  implement  the  de \nsegregation  plan  contemplate  only  one  trip  per  bus \nper  day! \n(f)  The  average  one-way  bus  t1'i p  ill  the  system  to \nday  is  over  15 miles in  length  and  takes  nearly an  hour \nand a  quarter.  The average  length  of the  one-way  trips \nrequired  under  the  conrt approved  plan  for  elementary \nstudents  is  less  than  seven  miles,  and  would  appear \nto  require  not  over  35  minutes  at  the  most,  because  no \nstops  will  be  necessary  het-ween  schools. \nThe  board's  figures  do  not.  contemplate  using \n(g) \nbusses  for  more  than  one  load  of  I)(u:;sengers  morning \nor  afternoon.  Round  trips  instead  of  one-way  trips \nmorning  and  afternoon  could  eut  the  bus  reqnirement.s \nsharply. \n\n154a \nSttpplemcntal  Fi·ndings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \n(h)  The  numbel'  of  busses  required  can  be  reduced \n35%  to  50%  by  staggering  the  opening  and  closing \nhours  of schools  so  that multiple bus  trips can be made. \nThis method  is  not considered  in  the  board's estimates, \naceording  to  testimony  of  D.  :M:organ,  bus  superin \n,J, \ntendent. \nSubstantial  economies  may  reasonably  be  ex \n(i) \npected  when  all  phases  of  the  bussing  operation  have \nheen  coord inatcd  instead  of  heing  considered  sepa \nrately. \n(j)  III  estimating how  many children  live  more than \na  mile  and  a  half  from  schools,  and  therefore  are  en \ntitled  to  transportation,  t.he  board's  transportation  peo \nple  have  used  some  very  short  measurements.  As  the \ncourt  meaSures  the  maps,  very  few  of  the  students  in \nthe  re-zoned  elementary  schools,  for  example,  live \nmorc  than  I1h  miles  from  their  assigned  schools.  I f  \nthe  board  wants  to  transport  children  who  live  less \nthan  1%  miles  away  they  may,  but  if  they  do,  it  is \nbecause  of  a  board  decision  rather  than  because  of  the \ncourt's  order. \n(k)  Transportation  requirements  could  be  reduced \n1% \nby  raising  the  walking  distance  temporarily  from \nto  perhaps  1%  miles.  This  has  apparently  not  been \ntaken  into  account. \nTestimony  of  J.  D.  MOl'gan  shows  that  busses \n(1) \ncall  be  operated at a  25%  overload.  Thus  a  60-passen \ngel'  bus  (the  average  size)  can  if  necessary  transport \n75  children.  Some  busses  in  use  today  transport  far \nmore. \n35.  Findings  of  Fact  as  to  Required  Transportation. \nAfter  many  days  of  detailed  study  of  maps,  exhibits  and \n\n155a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nstatistics,  and  after  taking  into  account  all  the  evidence, \nincluding the  \"discount factors\"  mentioned  above,  the  court \nfinds  as  facts  that  the  maximum  number  of  additional  chil \ndren who  may conceivably  require transportation  under  the \ncourt  ordered  plans,  and  the  maximum  numbers  of  addi \ntional  busses  needed  are  as  follows: \nN ct  Additiollal  Number  of \nTra\"/lsportees  Busses  N eoded \nSenior  Highs \n1,500  20 \nJunior  Highs \n2,500  28 \nElemcntaries: \nRe-zoned \n1,300  10 \nPaired  and  Grouped \n8,000  80 \nTotals  13,300  138 \n36.  These children  (all  hut a  few  hundred at Hawthorne, \nPiedmont,  Alexander  Graham,  :Myers  Park  High  School, \ni f  \nas \nEastover,  West  Charlotte  and  a  few  other  places), \nsigned  to  the  designated  schools ..  are  entitled  to  tran.spor \ntation under  existin.g  state  law,  independent of and  regard \nof \nless  th1·S  court's  order  respecting  bussing. \n37.  The  court  also  finds  that  the  plan  proposed  by  the \nboard  would  have  required  transportation  for  at least 5,000 \nstudents  in  addition  to  those  now  being  transported. \n38.  8eparabi.lity.  Each  of  the  jour  pa.rts  of  the  deseg \nregation  plan  is  separable  fro1n  the  other.  The  re-zoning \nof  elementarics  can  proceed  independent  of  tlle  pairing \nand  grouping.  The  pairing  and  grouping  can  take  place \nindependent  of  all  other  steps.

The  Tim.e  Table.  The  Fcbrual'y  5,  1970  order  fol \nlowed  the  time  ta hIe  reqnested  by  the  defendants.  At  the \nFebruary  hearing,  the  !o;chool  board  attorney  requested \n2 \nuntil  April  I,  1970  to  desegregate  the  elementary  schools \n(T.  20);  he  requested  that  high  school  seniors  be  allowed \nto  graduate  where  they  arc  (T.  21)  he  proposed  continu \nj \ning  junior  high  students  and  grades  10  and  11  in  their \npresent  schools  until  the  third  week  before  the  end  of \nschool  (T.  21).  The  request  of  Dr.  Self,  the  school  super \nintendent,  was  identical  as  to  elcmentaries  and  12th  grad \ners;  he  preferred  to  transfer  10th  and  11 th  graders  about \ntwo  weeks  before  school  was  over  (T.  95).  Availability  of \ntransportation  the  only  caveat  voiced  at  the  hearing. \nwa~ \n40.  The  February  5  order  expressly  provided  that  \"ra \ncial  balance\"  was  not  required.  The  percentage  of  black \nstudents  ill  the  various  parts  of  the  plans  approved  vary \nat \nfrom  3%  black  at  Bain  to  41 %  black  Cornelius. \n41.  Cost.  Busses  cost  around  $5,400.00  each,  varying \naccording  to  size  and  equipment.  Total  cost  of 138  busses, \nif  that  many  are  needed,  would  therefore  he  about  $745,-\n200.00.  That  is  much  leRs  than  one  week's  portion  of  the \n:Mecklenbnrg'  school  budget.  Busses  last  1.0  to  15  years. \nThe  state  replaces  them  when  worn  out. \nSome  additional  employees  will  be  needed  if  the  trans \nportation  system  is  enlarged. \nDefendants  have  offered  various  estimates  of  large  in \ncreased  costs  for  administration,  parking,  maintenance, \ndriver  education  and  other  items.  I f  they  choose  to  incur \n\n- - • \n~- -~~~~ --~.-----------\n157a \nFact  dated  March \nSUPIJlm-nell[.al  Findillgs  of  21,  1.9';'0 \nexcess  costs,  the  court  call  not  prevent  it.

The  General  As \nsembly,  in  response  to  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education, \nadopted  thc  Pupil  Assignment  Act  of  1955-56,  North  Caro \nlina  General  Statutes,  §1l5-176,  which  was  quoted  in  the \nApril  23,  1969  order  and  which  is  still  the  law  of  North \nCarolina.  It  provides  that  school  boards  have  full  and \nfinal  authority  to  assign  children  to  schools  a 11(1  that  no \nchild  can  be  enrol1cd  in  nor  attend  a  school  to  which  he \nhas  not  been  assigned. \nl;0 \n\"Freedom  of  choice\"  to  pick  a  school  has  never  been \nI t  \na  right  of  North  Carolina  public  school  students.  has \nbeen  a  courtesy  offered  in  recent  yeal's  by  some  school \nboards,  and  its  chief  effect  has  been  to  preserve  seJi,'Te \ngation. \nSlight  token  desegregation  of  the  schools  occurred  in \nthe  years  following  Brown.  The  Mecklenburg  County  and \nthe  Cl1arlotte  City  units  were  merged  in  1961. \nThis  suit  was  filed  in  1965,  and  an  order  was  entered \nin  1965  approving  the  school  board's  then  plan  for  de \nsegregation,  which  was  substantially  a  freedom  of  choice \n• \nplan  coupled  with  the  closing  of  some  all-black  schools. \nThere  was  no  further  court  action  until  1968,  when  a \nmotion  was  filed  requesting  further  desegregation.  Most \n\n160a \nSupplemental  Memorandwn  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nwhite students still attended \"white\" schools  and  most black \nstudents  still  attended  \"black\"  schools.  The  figures  on \nthis  subject  were  analyzed  in  this  court's  opinion  of \nApril  23,  1969  (300  F.Supp.  1358  (196!)),  in  which  the \nbackground  and  history  of  local  segregation  and  its  con \ntinuing  discriminatory  nature  were  analyzed  at  length. \nIn that order  the  ruled  that substantial  progress  had \nCOlll-t \nbeen  made  and  that many of  the  alleged acts  of discrimina \ntion  were  not  proved. \nHowever,  certain  significant  findings  and  conclusions \nwere  made  which  have  been  of  record  without  appeal  for \neleven  months.  These  include  the  following: \n1.  The  schools  were  found  to  be  unconstitutionally \nsegregated. \n2.  Freedom  of choice  had failed;  no  white  child  had \nchosen  to  attend  any  black  school,  and  freedom  of \nchoice  promoted  rather  than  reduced  segregation. \n3.  The  concentration  of  black  population  in  north \nwest  Charlotte  and  the  school  segregation  which  ac \ncompanied  it  were  primarily  the  result  of  discrimina \ntory  laws  and  governmental  practices  rather  than  of \nnatural  \"neighborhood\"  forces.  (This  finding  was  re \naffirmed  in  the  order  of  November  7,  1969.) \n4.  The  board  had  located  and  controlled  the  size \nand  population  of  schools  so  as  to  maintain  segrega \ntion. \n5.  The  plan  approved  and  put  into  effect  in  1965 \nhad  not  eliminated  unlawful  segregation. \n6.  The  defendants  operate  a  sizeable  fleet  of busses, \nserving over  23,000  children  at  an  average  annual  cost \n(to  state and local  governments  combined)  of  not more \nthan  $40  per  year  per  pupil. \n\n- - - - -\n161.a \nSupplemental  Memorandu.m  d.ated  March \n.21.,  1970 \n7.  Transportation  by  bus  is  a  legitimate  tool  for \nschool  boards  to  use  to  desegregate  schools. \n8.  Faculties  were  segregated,  and  be  de \n~honld \nsegregated.. \n9.  Und.er  v.  New  Kent  Gowdy  School  Board, \nGreet~ \n391  U.S.  430  (1968),  there  was  now  an  active  duty \nto  eliminate  segregation. \nThe  board  was  directed  to  submit  a  plan  to  desegre \ngate  the  schools. \nThe  order  produced  a  great  outcry  from  school  board \nmembers  and  others.  It also  produced  n  plan  which  called \nfor  the  closing of  Second  Wal'(l,  the  only  black  high  school \nlocated  near  a  white  neighborhood;  and  it  produced  no \nrezoning,  no  elimination  of  gerrymandering,  and.  only \nminor  changes  in  the  pupil  assignment  plan.  I t  did  pro \nduce  an  undertaking to desegreg'ate  the  faculties.  The  plan \nwas  reviewed  in  the  c01lrt  order of  June  20,  1969,  in  which \nthe  court  approved  the  provisioll  for  offering  transporta \ntion  to  children  transferring  from  majority  to  minority \nsituations  and  directed  the  preparation  of  a  plan  for  pupil \ndesegl'ega tion. \nThe  court  also  specifically  fonnd  that  gerrymandering \nhad  been  taking  place;  and  several  schools  were  cited  as \nillustrations  of  gerrymandering- to  promote  or  preserve \nsegregation. \nIn  June  of  1969,  pursuant  to  the  hue  and  cry  which \nhad  been  raised  about  \"bussillg,\"  :Mecklcnburg  representa \ntives  in  the  General  Assembly  of  North  ·Carolina  sought \nand  procured  passage  of  the  so-called  \"an ti-bussing\"  sta \nG.S. \ntute,  N.C.  115-176.1.

It  has  recognized \nthat  where  people  live  should  not  control  where  they \ngo  to  school  nor  the  quality  of  their  education,  and \nthat  transportation  may  be  necessary  to  comply  with \nthe  law.

This  cOllrt \ndoes  not  take  lightly  the  Board's  promises  and  the \nBoard's  undertaking  of  its  affirmative  duty  under  the \nConstitution  and  accepts  these  assurances  at  face \nvalue.

For \nthe  most part,  that  property  sta11(1s  idle  today. \nThe  \"anti-bussing!!  law  was  not  found  by  the  board  to \ninterfere  with  this  proposed  wholesale  re-assigl1ment  and \n\"massive  bussing,\"  of  black  children  only,  for  pm·poses \nof  desegregation. \nThe  plan,  by  order  of  August  15,  1969,  was  approved \non  a  one-year  basis  only,  and  the  board  was  directed  to \nprepare and  file  by  November  17,  1969,  a  plan  for  complete \ndesegregation  of  all  schools,  to  the  maximum  extcnt  pos \nsible,  by  September  1,  1970. \nThe  defendants  filed  a  motion  asking  that  the  deadline \nto  prepare  a  plan  be  extended  fl·om  November  17,  1969, \nto  February  I,  1970.

The  result  was  the  pro \nchlCt.ion  of  two  plans  the  boarel  plan  and  the  plan  of  t.he \nconsultant,  Dr.  Finger. \nThe  detailed  work  both  final  plans  was  done  by  the \n011 \nschool  board  staff. \nThe  high  school  plan  prepared  by  the  hoard  ·was  recom· \nmended  hy  Dr.  Finger to  the  court with  one  minor  change . \n• \n\n170a \nSupplemental  Memornnd'l.Mn  dated  March  21,  1970 \nThis change  involved tmnsporting three hU11(lred  inner  city \nblack  children  to  Independence  High  School.  As  to  high \nschool  students,  then,  the  plan  which  was  ordered  by  the \nis \ncourt  to  take  effect  on  May  4,  1970  the  school  board's \nplan,  with transportation added for th,'ce  hundred students. \nThe  proportion of  black  children  in  the  high  schools  varies \nfrom  1770  to  36%  under  this  plan. \nFor  junior  high  schools,  separate  plans  were  prepared \nby  Dr.  Finger  and  by  the  board.  The  board  plan  would \nhave  used  zoning  to  desegregate  all  the  black  junior  high \nschools  except  Piedmont,  which  it  would  have  left  90% \nblack.  The  Finger  plan  employed  l'e-7.0ning  as  far  as  ap \npeared  feasible,  and  then  provided  for  transportation  be \ntween  inner  city  black  zones  and  outlying  white  schools  to \ndesegregate  all  the  schools,  including  Piedmont. \nThe court offered  the  school  board  the  options  of  (1)  re \nzoning,  or  (2)  closing  Piedmont,  or  (3)  two-way  transport \nof  students  between  Piedmont  and  other  schools.  or  (4) \naccepting  the  Finger  plan  which  descgregates  aU  junior \nhigh  schools. \nThe  board  met  and  elected  to  adopt  the  Finger  plan \nrather  than  close  Piedmont  or  rearrange  their  own  plan. \nThe  Finger  plan  may  require  the  transportation  of  more \nthan  the  board  plan  would  have  required,  hut  it \nstud~nts \nhandles  the  transportation  more  economically  and  effi \nciP.Jltl:-.r,  and  does  the  job  of  desegregating  the  junior  high \nschools.  The  percentage  of  black  students  in  the  junior \ngro \nhig-h  8('.hoo15  t.hus  constituted  will  vary  from  to  33%. \nThe  transportation  of  junior  high  students  called  for \nin  the  plan  thus adopted  by  tbe  board  pursuant to  the  eourt \norder  of  February  5,  1970,  is  essentially  the  same  sort \nthHt  was  ndopted  without  hesitation  for  4,245  black  chil \n(1I\"rn  when  t.he  seven  black  inner  city  :;;choo15  were  closen \nin  1969. \n\n171a \n• \nSu.pplemental  Memorandum  dated  March  21,  1970 \nFor elementary  schools  the  problem  is  more  complicated. \nDr.  Finger  prepared  several  plans  to  desegregate  the  ele \nmentary  schools  and  reviewed  them  with  the  school  staff. \nI t  \nwas  apparent  that  even  the  gerrymandering  considered \nthe \nby  the  board  could  not  desegregate  all  elementary \nis \nschools,  and  that  withont  transportation  there  no  way \nby  ,,-hich  in  the  immediate  future  the  continuing  effects  of \nstate  imposed  segregation  can  be  removed.  Dr.  Finger \nprepared  a  plan  which  proposed  re-zouing  of  as  many \nschools  as  could  be  desegregated  by  l'e-zoning  and  which \nthen  proposed  pfl i ring  or  grouping  of  schools.  By  pairi ng \nor  gronping,  a  black  school  and  one  more  white  schools \n01' \ncould  be  desegregated  by  having  gradCf;  one  through  four, \nbJack  and  white,  flttend  the  white  schools,  and  by  having \ngrades five  nnd  black  Hnd  white, attend  the  black school, \nsix~ \nand  by  providing  transportation  whore  to  accom \nneed.~d \nplish  this. \nThe  original  Finger  plan  proposed  to  group  hhlCk  i]lne1\" \neity  schools  with  white  schools  mostly  in  the  south  and \nsontheai'lt  perimeter  of  the  district. \nThe  school  staff  drafted  a  plan  which  went  as  far  as \nthey  could  go  with  re-zoning  and  stopped  there,  leaving \nhalf the  black elementarv children  in  black  schools  and  half \n-\nthe  white  elementary  chiliiren  in  white  schools. \nIn  other words,  hoth  the  plan  event.ually  proposed  by  the \nt.he \nschool  hoard  and  plan  proposed  by  Dr.  Finger  went \nflS  far  as  was  thought  practical  to  go  with  rc-zoning.  The \ndistinction  is  that  the Finger  plan  goes  ahead  and  does  the \njob  of desegregating  t.he  black  elementary  schools,  whereas \nthe  board  plan  stops  half  way  through  t.he  job. \nIn  its  original  Finger  pllln  elementary \nform  the  for \nwould  have  required  somewhat  less  t.ransport.ation \ns~hools \nthnn  it.s  final  form,  hut  would  have  been  more  rlifficnlt  to \n• \n\n172a \nSupplemental  IltJe-morandum  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nput  into  effect  rapidly.  The  pressure  of  time  imposed  by \ndecisions  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  other  appellate  cou rts \nhad  become  such  that  there  was  concern  lest  there  be  an \norder  from  one  of  the  appellate  courts  for  immediate \nFehruary or March desegregation of the entire system.  The \nschool  staff  therefore,  based  on  Finger's  guidelines,  pre \npared a  final  draft of his plan incorporating pairing, group \ning  and  transporti11g  on  a  basis  which  would  better  allow \nfor early imp1ementation  with  a  minimum of administrative \ncomplications,  in  lieu  of  his  original  plan. \nThe  result  is  that.  t.he  plan  for  elementary  schools  which \nis  known  as  the  \"Finger  plan\"  was  prepared  in  detail  by \nthe.  school  staff  and  incorporates  the  thought  and  work  of \nthe  staff  on  the  most  efficient  method  to  desegregate  the \nelementary  schools. \nThe  time  table  originally  adopted  by  this  court  in  April \nof  1969  was  one  calling  for  substantial  progress  in  1969 \nand  complete  desegregation  by  September  1970.  However, \non  October  29,  1969,  in  Alexander  v.  Holmes  County,  t.he \nSupreme  Court  ordered  immediate  desegregation  of  sev \neral  Deep  South  school  systems  and  said  that  the  Court \nof  Appea]s  \"slwuld  have  denied  all  motions  for  additional \ntime.\" \nThe  Supreme  Court  adhered  to  tbat  attitude  in  all \ndecisions  prior  to  this  court's  order  of  Fehruary  5,  1970. \nIn  Carter v.

The  annual  school  bus  cost  per  pupil \ntransported,  including  everything  except  the  original  cost \nof tbe bus, parking arrangements and  certain  local  adminis \ntrative  costs,  for  the  1968-69  year,  was  $19.92.  The  state \nreimburses  the  Charlotte-Afecklenburg  school  system  ap \nproximately  this  $19.92  per  pupil.  The  April  23,  1969,  and \nFebruary  5,  1970,  findings  of  fact  estimated  the  original \ncost  and  periodic  replacement  of  the  busses  themselves  at \nto  to  the \n$18  $20  per  pupil  per  yem·,  which,  added  $19.92, \nresulted  in  the  estimate  of  $40  as  the  total  annual  per \npupil  tnmsportation  cost.  That  estimate  assumed  that  the \nlocal  schools  would  have  to  pay  for  periodic  replacement \nof  busses  as  well  as  for  their  original  purchase.  Since  it \nis  now  cl'?RI'  from  the  deposition  of  D .  .T.  Dark  that  the \nreplacement  of  wom  ont  or  ohsolescent  busses  is  included \nill  the  $19.92  figure,  the  overall  estimate  of  $40  per  pupil \nper  year  is  far  too  high.  Instead  of  a  conti1Hting  annual \nlocal  per  pupil  cost  of  $1S  or  $20  to  supply  and  replace \nbusses,  as  the  court  originally  understood,  the  local  board \nwill  have to  bear only  administrative and  parking expense!';, \nplus  the  original,  one-time  pJ:ll\"chase  of  the  busses.  This \n• \ncuts  the  anTlual  cost  of bus  transportation  from  nearly  $40 \npel' pupil pel' year as originally estimated,  to  a  figure  closer \n\n182a \nFurther  Findings  of  Fact  on·  Matters  Raised  by  the \nMarch  Motions  of  Defendants \n26,  1970, \ndated  April \n3,  1970 \nto  $20  per  pupil  per  year,  and  reduces  the  capital  outlay \nrequired  of  the  local  board  to  the  one-time  purchase  of \nabout 138  busses  at  a  cost  of  about  $745,200.00,  plus  what \never may  prove  to  be  actually  required  in  the  way  of  addi \ntional  parking  fllciJities.

Although  the  evidence  concerning  the \n5,000  children  currently  transported  by  City  Coach  Lines \nlacks  clarity,  the  court  agrees  with  the  defendant  that  it \nshould not be  inferred  that  they  are  the  source  of payment \nfor  this  transportation,  and  the  court  specifically  corrects \nthe  previous  finding  so  as  to  delete  any  reference  to  the \nsource  of  payment  for  this  transportation. \nIf \n21.  The  school  board's  July  29,  1969  plan  (see  pages \n457 -459  of  the  record  on  appeal)  proposed  the  transfer \nand  transportation  of over  4,200  black  children.  The  court \non  November  7,  1969,  on  the  basis  of  the  then  evidence, \nfound  tbat  the  number  actually  transferred  was  1,315.  The \naffidavit  of  J.  D.  Morgan  dated  February  13,  1970  (para \ngraph  4,  page  770  of  the  record  on  appeal),  indicated  that \nthe  number  of  these  students  being  transported  was  738, \nrequiring  13  busses.  The  findings  of  fact  propospd  by  the \ndefendants  gave the number  as  \"over'  700.\"  The  J.  D. \n1\\[01' \ngan  affidavit  of  March  21.,  1970,  indicated  that  the  number \nof  busses  was  30  instead  of  13.

We  recognize,  of  cou)\"se,  that  a  change  in  the \nelementary  schools  may  require  some  modification  of  the \njunior  and  senior  high  school  plans,  and  our  remand  is \nnot  intended  to  preclude  t.his. \n1. \nThe  Charlotte-1.fecklenburg  school  system  serves  a  pop \nulation of over 600,000  people  in a  combined city and county \narea \nof  550  square  miles.  With  84-,500  pupils attending 106 \nschools,  it ranks  as  the  nation's 43rd  largest  school  district. \nIn  Swann  v.  Clwrlottc-Mecklenbu.l\"g  Rd.  of  Ed.,  369  F.2d \n29  (4th  Cir.  1966),  we  approved  a  desegl\"egation  plan  based \non  geographic  zoning  with  a  free  transfer  provision.  How \never,  this  plan  did  not  eliminate  the  dnal  system  of  schools. \nThe  district  court  found  that  elm'ing  the  1969-70  school \nyear,  some 16,000  black pupils,  out of a  total of 24,700,  were \nattending  25  predominantly  black  schools,  that  faculties \nhad  not  been  integrated,  and  that  othe,·  administrative \na \npractices,  including  free  transfer  plan,  tended  t.o  per \npetuate  segregation. \nNotwithstanding  our  1965  approval  of  the  school  board's \nplan,  the  dist.rict  court  properly  held  that  the  board  was \nimpermissibly  operating  a  dual  system  of  schools  in  the \nThe  board's  plan  provides:  \"The  faculties  of  all  schools  will  be \n1 \nassigned  so  that the  ratio  of  black  teachers  to  white  teachers  in  each \nschool  will  be  approximately  the  same  as  the  ratio  of  black  teachers \nto  white  teachers  in  the  entire  school  system.\"  We  have  directed \not.her  schoul  boards  to  desegregate  their  faculties  in  this  manner. \nSee  Nesbit  v.

The  district \njudge  pointed  out  that  black  residences  are  concentrated \nin  the  northwest  quadrant  of  Charlotte  as  a  result  of  both \npublic  and  private  action.  North  Carolina  courts,  in  com \nmon  with  many  courts  elsewhere,  enforced  racial  restric \ntive  covenants  on  real  until  Shelley  v.  Kraemer, \nproperty~ \n334  U.S.  1  (1948)  prohibited  this  discriminatory  practice. \nPresently  the  city  zoning  ordinances  differentiate  between \nblack  and  white  residential  areas.  Zones  for  black  areas \npermit  dense  occupancy,  while  most  white  areas  are  zoned \nfor  restricted land usage.  The district judge also found that \nurban  renewal  projects,  supported  by  heavy  federal  financ \ning  and  the  active  participation  of  local  government,  con \ntributed  to  the  city's  racially  segregated  housing  patterns. \nThe  school  boara,  for  its  part,  located  schools  in  black  resi \ndential  areas  and  fixed  the  size  of  the  schools  to  accommo \ndate  the  needs  of immediate  neighborhoods.  Predominantly \nblack\"  schools  were  the  inevitable  result.  The  interplay  of \nthese  policies  on  both  residential  and  educational  segrega \ntion  previously  has  been  recognized  by  this  and  other \ncourts.

All  pupils  are  eligible  to  ride  school \nnl:! \nbuses  if  they  live  farther  than  miles  from  the  schools \nto  which  they  are  assigned.  Overall  statistics  show  that \nabout  one-half  of  the  pupils  entitled  to  transportation  ride \nschool  buses.  Only  541  pupils  were  hussed  in  October  1969 \nto  predominantly  black  schools,  which  had  a  total  enroll \nment  of  over  17,000.  In  contrast,  8  schools  located  outside \nthe  black  residential  area  have  in  the  aggregate  only  96 \n1% \nstudents living  within  miles.  These schools  have a  total \nenrollment of about 12,184 pupils,  of whom  5,349  ride  school \nbuses. \nII. \nThe  school  board  on  its  own  initiative,  or  at  the  direc \ntion  of  the  district  court,  undertook  or  proposed  a  number \nof  reforms  in  an  effort  to  create  a  unitary  school  system. \nI t  closed  7  schools  and  reassigned  the  pupils  primarily  to \nIt \nincrease  racial mixing.  drasticnl1y gerrymandered  school \n-\n• \n•  - = \nalJ'o \n(7th  Cir.  1!l68),  286  F.

I t  created a  single  athletic \nleague  without  distinction  between  white  and  black  schools \nor athletes,  and  at its urging, black  and  white PTA councils \nwere  merged  into  a  single  organization.  I t   eliminated  a \nschool  bus  system  that  operated  a  racial  basis,  and \n011 \nestablished  nondiscriminatory  practices  in  other  facets  of \nthe  scbool  system.  I t   modified  its  free  transfer  plan  to \nprevent  rcsegl'egation,  and  it  provided  for  integration  of \nthe  faculty  and  administrative  st.aff. \nThe  district  court,  after  a  painstaking  analysis  of  the \nboard's proposals and  the  relevant authorities,  disapproved \nthe  board's final  plan,  primarily  because  it  left  ten  schools \nnearly a]]  black.  In  reaching this decision,  the district court \nheld that the  board must integrate the student body of every \nschoo]  to  convert from  a  dual  system  of  schools,  which  had \nbeen  established  by  stat.e  action,  to  a  unitary  system. \nThe  necessity  of  dealing  with  segregation  that  exists \nhecause  governmental  policies  foster  segregated  neighbor \nhood  schools  is  not  confined  to  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSchool  District.  Similar  segregat.ion  occurs  in  many  other \ncities  throughout  the  nation,  and  constitutional  principles \ndealing  with  it  should  be  applied  national1y.  The  solution \nis  not  free  from  difficulty.  I t   is  now  well  settled  that \nschool  boards  operating  dual  systems  have  an  affirmative \nduty \"to couvert to  a  unitary  school  system  in  which  racial \ndiscrimination would be eliminated root and  branch.\"  Green \nv.

May \n26,  1970 \nBoth  the  findings  of  the  district  court  and  the  evidence \nsubmitted  by  the  board  are  based  On  estimates  that  rest \nOn  many  variables.  Past  practice  has  shown  that  a  large \npercentage  of  st.udents  eligible  for  bus  transportation  pre \nfer  to  provide  their  own  transportation.  However,  it  is \ndifficult  to  accurately  predict  how  mallY  eligible  st.udents \nwill  accept  transportation  on  the  new  routes  and  schedules. \nThe  number  of  students  that.  a  bus  can  carry  each  day \ndepends  in  part  on  the  number  of  trips  the  bus  can  make. \nScheduling two  trips for  a  bus  generally  reduces  costs.  But \nstudent  drivers  may  not  be  able  to  spend  the  time  required \nfor  two  trips,  so  that  aduH  drivers  will  have  to  be  hired \nat  substantially  highel'  salaries.  I t  is  difficult  to  accurately \nfOI'ecast  how  traffic  delays  will  affect  the  time  needed  for \neach  trip,  for  large  numbers  of  scbool  buses  themselves \ngenerate  traffic  problems  that  only  experience  can  measure. \nThe  board  based  its  projections on  each  54-passenger  bus \ncarrying  about  40  high  school  pupils  or  54  junior  high  and \nelementary  pupils  for  one  roundtrip  a  day.  Using  this \nformula,  it  arrived  at  a  need  of  4-22  additional  buses  for \ntransporting 19,285  a.dditional  pupils.  This  appears  to  be  a \nless  efficient  operation  than  tbe  present system which  trans \nports 23,600  pupils with  280  buses,  but the board's  witnesses \nsuggest  that  prospects  of  heavier  traffic  justify  the  dif \nference.  The  board  also  envisioned  parking  t.hat  seems  to \nbe  more  elahorate  than  that cUl'I'ently  used  at  some  schools. \nIn  making  its  findings,  the  district  court  applied  factors \nderived  from  present  bus  operation,  such  as  the  annual \noper'ating  cost  pel'  student,  t.he  average  number  of  trips \neach  bus  makes,  the  capacity  of  t.he  buses  including  per \nmissible  overloads,  and  t.he  percentage  of  eligible  pupils \nwho  use  other  forms  of  transportation.  The  district  court \nalso  found  no  need  for  expensive  parking  facilities  or  for \n\n194a \nOpinio,t1s  of  C01/rt  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nadditional  personnel  whose  costl;  could  not  he  absorbed  by \nthe  amount  allocated  for  operating  expenses.  While  we \nrecognize that no  estimate  whether submitted by  the board \nor  made  by  the  court  can  be  absolutely  correct,  we  accept \nas  1I0t  clearly  erroneous  the  findings  of  the  district  court. \nOpposition  to  the  assignment  of  pupils  nnder  both  the \nboard's  plan  and  the  plan  the  court  approved  centered  on \nbussing,  which  nnrnbers  among  its  critics  both  black  and \nwhite  parents.  This  criticism,  however,  cannot  justify  the \nmaintenance  of a  dual  system  of  schools.  Cooper  v.  Aaron, \n358  U.S.  1  (1958).  Bnssillg  is  neither  new  nor  unusual.  It \nhas  been  used  for  years  to  trawlport  pupils  to  consolidated \nschools  in  both  racially  dual  and  unitary  school  systems. \nFigures  compiled  by  the  National  Education  Association \nshow  that  nationally  the  numbc\\'  of  pupils bussed  increased \nfrom  12  mill ion  in  the  1958-59  school  yea r  to  17  million  a \ndecade  later.  In  North  Carolina  54.970  of  all  pupils  are \nbussed.  There  the  average  daily  roundtl'ip  is  24  miles,  and \nthe  annual  cost is  over $14,000,000.

In  determining  who  should  be \nbussed  alld  where  they  should  be  bussed,  a  school  board \nshould  take  into  consideration  the  age  of  the  pupils,  the \ndistance  and  time  required  for  tl'aDsportatioD,  the  effect \non  traffic,  and  the  cost  ill  relation  to  the  board's  resources. \nThe  board  should  view  bussing- for  integl'ation  ill  the  light \nthat  it  views  bussing  for  othel'  legitimate  improvements, \nsuch  as school consolidation and  the location  of new  schools. \nIn  short,  the  boarn  should  draw  on  its  experience  with \nbussing in  general  the henefits  and  the  defects  so  that it \nmay  intelligently  plan  the  part  that hussing  \\v1U  play  in  a \nunitary  school  system. \n\n195a \nOpinio·118  of  Court.  of  Appeals  doled  May  1970 \n26, \nViewing  the  plan  the  disb'ict  court  approved  for  junior \nand  senior  high  schools  against.  these  principles  and  the \nbackground  of national,  state, and  local  transportation  pol \nicies,  we  ('.ollclude  that  it  provides  a  reasonable  way  of \nelminating  all  segregation  in  those  schoo1s.  The  estimated \nin \nincrease  the  number  of  junior  and  senior  high  school \nstudents  who  must be  bussed  is  about 17%  of all  pupils now \nbeing bussed,  The additional  pupils  are in  the  upper grades \nwill \nand  for  the  most  part  they  he  going  to  schools  already \nserved  by  busses  from  other  sections  of  the  district.

While  a  6070-40%  ratio \nof white  to  black  pupils  might  be  desirable  under  some  cil' \ncumstances,  rigid  adherellce  to  this  formula  in  every school \nshould  be  allowed  to  defeat  integration. \n110t \nOu  the  other  hand,  the  Finger  plan,  which  the  di\"triet \ncourt  approved,  will  require  transporting  9,300  pupils  in \n90  additional  buses.  The  greatest  portion  of  the  proposed \ntransportation  involves  cross-bussing  to  paired  schoo18-\nthat  is,  black  pupils  in  grades  one  through  four  would  be \ncarried  to  predominantly  white  schools,  and  white  pupils \nin  the  fifth  and  sixth  grades  would  be  transported  to  the \nblack  schools.  The  average  daily  roundtrip  approximates \n15  miles  through  central  city and  suburban  traffic. \nThe  additional  elementary  pupils  who  must  be  bussed \nrepresent  an  increase  of  39%  ovcr  all  pupils  presently \nbeing  bussed,  and  their  transportation  will  require  an  in \ncrease  of  about  32'10  ill  the  present  fleet  of  buses.  When \nthe  additional  bussing  for  elementary  pupils  is  coupled \nwith the  additional requiremcnts for  junior and senior high \nschools,  which  we  have  approved,  the  total  percentages  of \nincrease  are:  pupils,  56%,  and  buses,  49%.

The  command  was  once  more \nreaffirmed  in  Garter  v.  West  Feliciana  School  Board,  396 \nU.S.  290  (1970),  requiring \"relief that will  at once  extirpate \nany  lingering  vestiges  of a  constitutionally prohibited  dual \nJ., \nschool  system.\"  (Harlan,  concurring  at  292). \nWe  face  in  this  case  a  school  district  divided  along \nracial  lines.  This  is  not  a  fortuity.  I t  is  the  result,  as  the \nmajority  has  recognized,  of  government  fostered  residen \ntial  patterns,  school  planning,  placement,  and,  as  the \nDistrict  Court  fonnd,  gerrymandering.  These  factors  have \ninteracted  on  each  other  so  that  by  this  date  the  black \nand white  populations,  in  school  and  at home,  are  virtually \nentirely  separate. \nAs  of November 7,  1969,  out of 106  schools in  the  system, \n57  were  racially  identifiable  as  white,  25  were  racially \nidentifiable  as  black.!  Of  these,  nine  were  all  white  schools \nand eleven all  black.  Of 24,714 black  students in  the  system, \n16,000  were  in  entirely  or  predominantly  black  schools. \n% \nIn  the  entire  system,  71  of  the  pupils  are  white,  29%  of  the \n1 \npupils  are  black.  The  District  Judge  deemed  a  school  having  86% \nor greater  white  population  ident.ifiable  as  white,  one  with  56%  or \ngreater  black  population  identifiable  as  black. \n\n203a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  .Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nThere  are  76  elementary  schools  with  over  44,000  pupils. \nIn  November  1969,  43  were  identifiable  as  white,  16  as \nblack,  with  13  of  the  lutter  98%  or  more  black,  and  none \nless  than  65%.  For  the  future  the  Board  proposes  little \nimprovement.  There  would  still  be  25  identifiably  white \nelementary  schools  and  approximately  half  of  the  white \nelementary  students  would  attend  schools  86  to  10010 \n\",,·hite.  Nine  schools  would  remain  83  to  100%  black,  serv \ning'  6,432  students  or  over half  the  black  elementary  pupils. \nTo  call  either  the  past  or  the  proposed  distribution  a \n\"unitary  system\"  would  be  to  embrace  an  And \nillusion.~ \nthe  majority  does  not  contend  that  the  system  is  unitary, \nfor  it  holds  that  \"the  district  court  properly  disapproved \nthe  school  board's  elementary  school  proposal  because  it \nleft  about  one-half  of  both  the  black  und  white  elementary \npupils  in  schools  that  were  nearly  completely  segregated.\" \nThe  Board's  duty  then  is  plain  and  unarguable:  to  convert \nto  a  unit,ary  system.  The  duty  is  absolut.e.  I t  is  not  to  be \ntempered  or  watered  down.

The  N  of  the  Cou·rl-Ordcred  Plan \necessify \nThe  plan  ordered  by  the  District  Court  works.  I t  does \nthe  job  of  desegregating  the  schools  completely.  This \n\"places  a  heavy  burden  upon  the  board  to  explain  its  pre \nference  for  an  apparently  less  effective  method.\"  Green, \nsupra  at  439. \nThe  most  significant  fact  about  the  District  Court's \nplan  is  that  it ..  or  one  like  it  is  the  only  one  that  can \nwork.  Obviously,  wben  the  black  students  are  all  on  one \nside  of  town,  the  whites  on  the  other,  only  transportation \nwill  bring  them  together.  The  District  Judge  is  quite \nexplicit: \nBoth  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  board  staff  appear \nto  have  agreed,  and  the  court  finds  as  a  fact  that  for \nthe  present  at  least,  there  is  no  way  to  desegregate \nthe  al1-black  schools  in  Northwest  Charlotte  without \nproviding  (and  continuing  to  provide)  bus  or  other \ntransportation  for  thousands  of  childrell.  All  plans \nand  all  variations of plans considered  for  this  purpose \nlead  in  one  fashion  or  another  to  that conclusion. \nThe  point has  been  perceived  by  the  counsel  for  the  Board, \nwho  have  candily informed  us  that  if  the  job  must  be  done \nthen  the  Finger  plan  is  the  way  to  do  it. \nThe  only  suggestion  that  there  is  a  possible  alternative \nmiddle  course  came  from  the  United  States,  participating \nas  amicus  curiae.  Its  brief  was  prefaced  by  the  following \nrevealing  confession: \n\n- - - - - - - -\n~  ~  ~  ~--\n205a \nOpinions  of  Co·u.rl.  of  AZJpeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nWe  understand  that  the  record  in  the  case  is \nvol ul:wnous,  and  we  would  note  at  the  outset  that  we \nhave  been  unable  to  analyze  the  record  as  a  whole. \nAlthough  have  carefully  examined  the  district \nwe \ncourt's  various  opinions  and  orders,  the  school  board's \nplan,  and  those  plendi  readily  available  to  us,  we \nngs \nfecI  that  we  are  not  conversant  with  all  of  the  factual \nconsiderat.ions  which  may  prove  determinative  of  this \nappeal.  Accordingly,  here  attempt,  not  to  deal \nwe \nextensively  with  factual  matters,  but  rather  to  set \nforth  some  legal  considerations  which  may  be  helpful \nto  the  Court. \nNowithstanding  this  disclaimer,  the  Government  went  on \nto  imply  in  oral  argument  and  has  apparently  impressed \non  this  conrt  thn t  HE,V  eould  do  better.  No  concrete \nsolution  is  suggested  hut  t.he  Government  does  advert  to \nthe  possibilit.y  of  pairing  and  grouping  of  schools.  Two \npoints  stand  out.  First.,  pairing  anel  grouping  are  pre \ncisely  what  tbe  Finger  plan,  adopted  by  the  District  Court, \ndoes.  Second,  in  the  of  this  case,  these \ncircum~tances \nmethods  ltC'cessarily  entail  bussing. \nI  not  \"favorably  impressed\"  by  the  Government's \nalll \nperformance.  Its  vague  and  noncommital  representations \ndo  little  but  obscure  the  real  issnes,  introduce  uncertainty \nand  fail  to  meet  t.he  \"heavy  burden\"  necessary  t.o  over \nturn  the  Dist.rict  Court's  effective  plan.\n3 \n-\nA  federal  judge is  not  J·equired  to  consult  with  the  Department \n3 \nof  Health,  Edueatioll  and  Welfare  legal  issues.

The  Feasibility  of  the  Plan \nOf  course  it  goes  without  saying  that  school  boards \narc  not  obligated  to  do  the  impossible.  Federal  courts \ndo  not joust at  windmills.  Thus it is  proper to  ask whether \na  plan  is  feasible,  whether  it  can  be  accomplished.  There \nis  no  genuine  dispute  on  this  point.  The  plan  is  simple \nand  quite  efficient.  A  bus  will  make  one  pickup  in  the \nvicinity  of  the  children's  residences,  say  in  the  white \nresidential  area.  It then  will  make  an  express  trip  to  the \ninner-city  school.  Because  of  the  non-stop  featnre,  time \ncan  be  considerably  shortened  and  a  bus  could  make  a \nreturn  trip  to  pick  up  black  students  in  the  inner  city  and \nto convey them  to  the  outlying school.  There  is  no  evidence \nof  insurmountable  traffic  problems  due  to  the  increased \n.  . \n=  .\" • \n- = \ncontrolling  the  actions  of  states  and  their  subdivisions  is \npeculiarly  a  judicial  function. \nBowman  v.  County  School  Board  of  Charles  City  County,  382  F.2d \n326  (1967). \nAlthough  the  definition  of  goals  is  for  the  court,  HEW  may  be \nable  to  provide  technical  assistance  in  overcoming  the  logistical \nimpediments  to  the  desegregation  of  a  school  system.  Thus  it  was \nquite  understandable  that  at  the  outset  of  this  case  the  District \nCourt  invited  t.he  Bonrd  to  consult  with  HEW.  Desegregation  of \nthis  large  educational  system  was  likely  to  be  a  complex  and \nadmini5;tratively  difficult  task,  in  which  the  expertise  of  the  fed \neral  agency  might  be  of  help.  However,  after  a  substantial  period \nof  time  and  the  begiuning  of  a  new  school  year,  it  became  clear \nthat  the  Board  had  no  intention  of  devising  a  meaningful  plan, \nmuch  less  seeking  advice  on  how  to  do  so.  At  that  point  (Decem \nber  HI6!\"!)  with  the  need  for  speed  in  milld,  the  Judge  appointed \nan  expert  already  familiar  with  the  school  system  to  work  with \nthe  school  staff  ill  developing  a  plan. \nWhether  to  utilize  the  assistance  of  HEW  i:.  ordinarily  up  to \nthe  district judge.  Consultation  in  formulating  the  mechanics  of  a \nplan  is  not  obligatory.  The  method  used  by  the  Judge  in  this \nuase  was  certainly  sufficient.  Moreover,  now  that  a  plan  has  been \ncreated  and  it  appears  that  there  are  no  real  alternatives,  a  re \nmand  for  HEW's  advice  seems  an  exercise  in  futility. \n\n207a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nbussing.  Indeed,  straight  line  bussing  promises  to  be \n~ \nquicker.  The present average  one-way  trip  is  over 15  miles \nand  takes  one  hour  and  fourteen  minutes;  under  the  plan \nthe  average  one-way  trip  for  elementary  students  will  be \nless  than  seven  miles  and  35  minutes.  The  cost of all  of  the \nadditional  bussing  will  be  less  than  one  week's  operating \nbudget. 5 \nC.

That  the  13S  additional  busses  would  gravely  aggravate \nthe  congestion  is  dubious,  to  say  the  least. \nThe  District  ,fudge  rejeeted  the  Board's  inflated  claims,  and \n5 \nfoulld  that  altogether  the  Finger  plan  would  bus  13,300  new  stu \ndents  ill  138  ndditiolllli  busses.  The  Board  had  estimated  that \n11),285  additional  pupils  would  have  to  be  transported,  requiring \n422  addit.ional  busses.  Tlds  estimate  is  disproportionate  on  its \nf<lce,  for  presently  23,600  pupils  are  trflnsported  in  280  busses. \nAs  indicated  above,  the  direct  bus  routes  envisioned  by  the  Finger \nrlml  should  Ilccomp1ish  increased,  not  diminished,  efficiency.  The \ncourt  below,  after  close  analysis,  discounted  the  Board's  estimate \nfor  other  reaSOIlH  as  well,  including  the  \"very  short  measurements\" \nused  by  the  Board  in  determining  who  would  have  to  be  bussed, \nthe  failure  of  the  Board  to  for  staggering  of \n<II~COUllt  round·trip~, \nopening  ilnd  closing  hours,  and  overloads. \n• \n\n208a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated \nMay  26,  1970 \nThe  lower  courts  were  to  have  \"a  practical  flexibility  in \nshaping  •  •  remedies.\"  349  U.S.  at  300.  Thus,  in  sub \nII \nsuming  these  cases  under  traditional  equity  principles, \nthe  Supreme  Court  brought  the  desegregation  decree \nwithin  the  rule  that  to  be  overturned  it  \"must  [be]  demon \nstrate[d]  that  there  was  no  reasonable  basis  for  the \nDistrict  Judge's  decision.\"  United  States  v.  tV.

As  the  Supreme  Court  made  clear  in  Greett, \nsupra,  those  who  would  challenge  an  effective  course  of \naction  bear  a  \"heavy  burden.\"  The  Finger  plan  is  a  re \nmarkably  economical  scheme  when  viewed  in  the  light  of \nwhat  it  accomplishes.  There  has  been  no  showing  that  it \ncan  be  improved  or  replaced  by  better  or  more  palatable \nmeans.  I t  should,  then,  be  sustained. \nIII \nOBJECTIONS  RAISED  AGAINST  THE  COURT-ORDERED  PLAN \nA.  The  \"Illegal\"  Objective  of the  Plan \nMy  Brother  Bryan  expresses  concern  about  the  plan, \nregardless  of  cost,  because  it  undertakes,  in  his  view,  an \nillegal  objective:  \"achieving  racial  balance.\"  Whatever \nmight be  said for  this  view abstractly or in  another context, \nit  is  not  pertinent  here.  We  are  confronted  in  this  case \nwith  no  question  of  bussing  for  mere  balance  unrelated  to \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n209a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \na  mandatory  constitutional  goal.  What  the  District  Court \nhas  ordered  is  compliance  with  the  constitutional  impera \ntive  to  disestablish  the  existing  segregation.  Unless  we \nare  to  palter  with  words,  desegregation  necessarily  entails \nintegration,  that  is  to  say  integration  in  some  substantial \ndegree.  The  dictum  to  the  contrary  in  Briggs  v.  Ell'iotl .. \n132 F. Supp. 776  (E.D.S.C.  1955), was  rejected by necessary \nimplication  by  the  Supreme  Court  ill  Green,  supra,  and \nexplicitly  by  this  court  in  Walker  v.  CO'l/.'uty  School  BOQ1'd \nof Bru.nswick  Co.,  413  F.2d  53,54  n.2  (4th  Cir.  1969). \nAs  my  Bl'other  ·Winter  shows,  there  is  no  more  suitable \nway  of achieving  this  task  than  by setting,  at least initially, \na  ratio  roughly approximating that of the  racial  population \nin  the  school  system.  The  District  Judge  adopted  this  ad \nhoc  measurement  as  a  starting guide,  expressed  a  willing \nness  to  accept a  degree  of modification,G  and  departed  from \nit where  circumstances  required. \nB.  The  \"Um'easonableness\"  of  the  Plan \nThe  majority  does  not  quarrel  with  the  plan's  objective, \nnor,  accept.ing  the  findings  of  t.he  District  Court,  does  it \nreally  dispute  that  the  plan  can  be  achieved.  Rather,  we \nare  told,  the  plan  is  an  unreasonahle  burden. \nThe  District  .J udge  wrote  in  his  Deccmber  1  order  that \nG \nFixed  ratios  of  pupils  in  particular  schools  will  not  be  set. \nH  the  board  in  one  of  its  three  tries  had  presented  a  plan \nfor  desegregatioll,  the  court  would  have  sought  ways  to  ap \npl\"Ove  varilltions  in  pupil  ratios.  In  llefault  of  allY  sueh  plan \nfrom  the  school  board,  the  court  will  start  with  the  thought, \norigillally advllnced  in  the ordr.r  of April  23,  that  should \neffort~ \nbe  made  to  reach  a  71-29  ratio  in  the  various  schools  so  t.hat \nthere  will  be  no  basis  for  cOlltending  that one  school  is  racially \ndiffcrcnt  from  the  others,  but  to  understaud  that  yariations \nfrom  that  norm  may  be  unavoidable. \n\n210a \nOpinio'Jls  of  Court  of  Al)peals  dated  May \n26. .  1970 \nThis  notion  must  be  emphatically  rejected.  At  bottom \nit  is  no  morc  than  an  abstract,  unexplicated  judgment  a \nconclusion  of  the  majority  that,  all  things  considered,  de \nsegregation  of  this  school  system  is  not  worth  the  price. \nThis  is  a  conclusion  neither  nor  school  boards  are  per \nwe \nmitted  to  make. \nIn  making  policy  decisions  that  nrc  not  constitutionally \ndictated,  state  authorities  are  free  to  decide  in  their  dis \ncretion  that a  proposed  measure  is  worth  the  cost  involved \nor  that  the  cost  is  ullreasonablf!,  and  accordingly  they  may \nadopt or reject the proposal.  This  is not.  such a  case.  Vindi \ncation  of  the  plaintiffs'  constitutional  right  docs  not  rest \nin  the  school  board's  discI'etion,  as  the  Supreme  Court \nauthoritatively decided  rsixteen  years  ago  and  has  repeated \nwith  increasing  emphasis.  I t  is  not  for  the  Board  or  this \ncourt  to  say  that  the  cost  of  compliance  with  Bt·ow'n  is \n\"unreasonable.\" \nThat  a  subjective  assessment  is  the  operational  part  of \nthe new  doctrine  is highlighted  by a  study \n\"reasonabIcne~s\" \nof  the  factors  the  majority  bids  school  boards  take  into \naccount  in  making  bussing  neterminatiolls.  \"[A]  school \nboard  should  take  into  consideration  the  age  of  the  pupils, \nthe distance  and  time requireil  for transportation, the  effect \ntraffic,  and the cost in  relation  t.o  the board's  resources.\" \n011 \nBut,  as  we  have  seen,  diRtance  and  time  will  be  compara \ntively short, the effect on traffic is  llndemon!'!.tfl.1ted,  tbe incre \nmental  cost  is  marginal.  As  far  as  age  is  concerned,  it has \nnever  prevented  the  bussiTlg  of  pupils  in  Charlotte-1fcck \nlenburg,  or  in  North  Carolina  generally,  where  70.9%  of \nall  bussed  students  are  elementary  pupils. \nI f  the transportation of elementary  pupils were  a  novelty \nsought  to  be  introduced  by  the  District  Court,  I  could \nunderstand  my brethren's  reluctance.  But,  as  is  conceded, \n\n211a \nOpinio11S  of  Court  of \nApllea1s  dated  May  1970 \n26~ \nbussing  of  children  of  elementary  school  age  is  an  estab \nlished  tradition.  Bussing  has  long  been  used  to  perpetuate \ndual  systems. 7  More  importantly,  bussing  is  a  recognized \neducational  tool  in  Charlotte-nJecklenbnrg and  North  Caro \nlina.  And  as  the  National  Education  Association  has  ad \nmirably  demonstrated  in  it.s  brief,  bussing  has  playcd  a \ncrucial  J'ole  in  the  evolution  from  the  one-room  schoolhouse \nin  this nation.  Since  the  majorit.y  accepts  the  leh.;.timacy  of \nbussing,  today's  decision  totally  baffles  rue. \nIn  the  final  analysis,  the  elementary  pupil  phase  of  the \nFinger plan  is disapproved because  the  percentage  increase \nin  hussing  is  somehow  determined  to  he  too  onerous,8  Why \nthis  is  so  we  are  not  told.  The  Board  plan  itself  would  bus \n5,000  additional  pupils.  The  fact  remains  that  in  North \nCarolina  55%  of  all  pupils  aJ'e  now  being  bussed.  Under \nthe  Fingcl'  pJalL  approximately 47%  of  the  Charlotte-Meck \nlenburg  student  population  would  be  bussed.  This  is  well \nwithin  the  existing  percentage  throughout  the  state. \nThe  majority's  proposal  is  inherently  ambiguous.  The \nFor  some  extreme  examples,  see:  School  Board  of  Warren \n7 \nCounty  v.  Kelly,  F.2d  Cir.  ]  Corbin  v.  County \n259  4f17  (4th  958)  ; \nSehool  Bd.  of  Pnlllski  County,  117  F.2d  024  (4th  Cir.  Hl49); \nGriffith  v.  Bd.  of  Edue.  of  Yallce.Y  County,  186  F.

Sec  also,  Chambers  v.  Ircdell  Co.,  F.2d  (4th \nCir.1970)  (dissenting  opinion). \nThe  Illlljority  calculates  the  clementary  school  portion  of  the \n8 \nplan  to  mean  a  39%  increase  in  bussed  pupils,  32%  increase  in \nbusses;  the  whole  package,  it  is  said,  would  require  a  56%  pupil \nincrease  alld  49%  bus  increase. \nThese  figures  are  accurate  but  do  not  tell  the  whole  story.  I f  \none  inelndes  within  the  number  of  students  presently  being  trans \nported  those  t.hat  are  bussed  on  commercial  lines  (5000),  the  in· \ncrease  in  pupils  transported  would  1I0t  appear  to  be  as  large. \nThus  the  plan  for  elementary  schools  would  entail  a  33%  bussed \npupil  increment,  the  whole  Finger  plan,  47%. \n\n212a \nOpinions  of  Court.  of  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nAl)1}(~als \ncourt-ordered  plan  is  said  to  he  unreasonable.  Yet  the \nSchool  Board's  own  plan  has  also  heen  disapproved.  Does \nthe decision  ·that the  Finger plan  is  unreasonable  depend \non  the  premise  that  an  in termediate  course  is  available 1 \n'\\Vould  the  amount  of  segregation  J'etained  in  the  School \nBoard's  plan  be  avowedly  sanctioned  if  it  were  recognized \nthat  nothing  short  of  the  steps  delineated  in  the  District \nCourt's  plan  will  suffice  to  eliminate  it'  Since  there  is  no \npracticable  alternative,  mnst  we  assume  that  the  majority \nis  willing  to  tolerate  the  lleficiencies  in  the  Board  plan' \nThese quest.ions  remain unresolved  and  thus  the  ultimate \nmeaning of the \"J'easonableness\"  doctrine is undefined.  Suf \nfice  it  t.o  say  that  this  case  is  not  un  appropriate  one  in \nwhich  to  grapple  with  the  theoretical  issue  whether  the \nlaw  can  endure  a  slight  but  irreducible  remnant  of  segre \ngated  schools.  This  record  presents  no  such  problem.  The \nremnant  of  racially  identifiable  elementary  schools,  t.o \nwhich the District Court addressed  itself,  encompasses  over \nbalf the  elementary  population.  This  large  fraction  cannot \nbe  called  slight;  nor,  as  Finger  plan  demonstrates,  is \ntll(~ \nit \nirreducible. \nI  am  even  more  convinced  of  the  unwisdom  of  reaching \nout  to  fashion  a  new  \"rule  of  reason,\"  when  this  record  is \nfar  from  requiring  it,  because  of  the  serious  consequences \nit would  portend  for  the  general  course  of  school  desegre \ngation.  Handed  a  new litigable  issue  the  so-called  reason \nableness  of a  proposed plan  school  hoards can  be  expected \nto  exploit  it  to  the  hilt.  The  concept  is  highly  susceptible \nto  delaying  tactics  in  the  courts.  Everyone  can  advance  a \ndifferent opinion  of what is  reasonable.  Thus,  rarely  would \nit  be  possible  to  make  expeditious  disposition  of  a  boarel's \nclaim  that its  segregated  system  is  not  \"reasonably\"  eradi \ncable.  Even  more  pernicious,  the  new-born  rule  furnishes \na  powerful  incentive  to  communities  to  perpetuate  and \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - -\n213a \nOphli011S  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  MaV \n26,  1970 \ndeepcll  the  effects  of  race  separatioll  so  that,  when  chal \nlenged,  they can  protest that belated  remedial  action  would \nbe  unduly  burdensome. \nMoreover,  the  opinion  catapults  us  back  to  the  time, \nthought  passed,  when  it  was  the  fashion  to  contend  that \nthe  inquiry  was  not how  much  progress  had  been  made  but \nthe  presence  or  absence  of  good  faith  on  the  part  of  the \nhoard.  Whether  an  \"intractable  remnant  of  segregation\" \ncan  be  allowed  to  persist,  apparently  will  now  depend  in \nlarge  measure  on  a  slippery  test:  an  estimate  of  whether \nthe  Board  has  made  \"every  reasonable  effort  to  integrate \nthe  pupils  under  its  contro1.719 \n_Tn.

I  feel  constrained  to  register  my  dissent \nfrom  this  view  ulthough  ou  no  accowlt  do  subscribe  to  the  prop \nI \nosition  t.hat  tIle  disposition  of  the  case  depends  on  this  issue. \nOn  April  23,  1969  the  District  Judge  declared  t.he  Charlotte \nl\\{ecklen  School  District  illegally  segregated.  He  found  it  un \nbul'l:'~ \nllecessary  lit  that  time  to  decide  whether  the  Board  had  deliber \nately gerrymandered  to  perpetuate the dual system  since  he  believed \nt.hat  the  court  order  to  follow  would  promote  substantial  changes. \nThe  Board  wns  given  nntil  May  15  to  devise  a  plan  eliminating \nfaculty  and  student  segregation. \nA  majority  of  the  Board  voted  not  to  take  an  immediate  appeal \nand  the  school  superintendent was  directed  to  prepare  plan.  His \nII. \nmandate  was  hazy.  According  to  the  court  below-\nNo  express  guidel ines  were  given  the  superintendent.  How \never,  the  views  of  many  members  expressed  at  the  meeting \nwet'e  so  opposed  to  serious  and  substantial  desegregation  that \neveryone  including  the  superintendent  could  reasonably  have \nconcluded,  as  the  court  does,  that  a  \"minimal\"  plan  was  what \nwas  callcd  for,  and  that  the  \"pIau\"  was  essentially  a  prelude \nto  ant.icipnted  disnpproval  and  appeal. \n• \n•  •  •  • \nThe  staff  were  llever  directed  to  do  any  serious  work  on  re \ndrawillg  of  f;chool  zone  lines,  pairing  of  schools,  combining \nzones,  grouping  of  schools,  cOllferences  with  the  Department \nof  Hr.alth,  Education  and  Welfare,  nor  any  of  the  other \n\n214a \nOpinio'ns  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1.970 \nThe  Supreme  Court  having  barred  further  delay  its \nby \ninsistent  emphasis  on  an  immediate  remedy,  we  should  not \nlend  ourselves  to  the creation  of  a  new  loophole  by  attenu \nating  the  substance  of desegregation. \npossible  methods  of  making  real  progress  towards  desegre-• \n• \ngabon. \nThe  superintendent's  plan  was  submitted  to  the  Board  on  May  8. \nI t  was  quite  modest  in  its  undertaking.  Nevertheless,  tll8  Board \n\"struck  out  virtually  all  the  effective  provisions  of  the  superin \nplan.\"  The  pIau  ultimately  filed  by  the  Board  on  May \ntendent'~ \n28  was  \"the  plan  pre. ... iously  found  racially  discriminatory  with \nthe  addition  of  one  element  the  provision  of  transportation  for \n[majority  to  minority  transfers.]\"  The  Board  also  added  a  rule \nmaking  a  student  who  transfers  to  a  new  high  school  ineligible  for \nathletics  for  year.  As  the  District  .Judge  found, \nII \n[t] he  effect  of  the  uth letie  penalty  is  obvious  it  discriminates \nagainst  black  students  who  may  want  to  transfer  and  take \npart  in  sports,  and  is  no  penalty  white  students  who  sllOw \n011 \nno  desire  for  such  transfers. \nIn  the  meantime  the  Boal'd  for  the  first  time  refused  to  accept \na  recommendatioll  of  the  superintendent  for  the  promotion  of  a \nteacher  to  priJlcipal.  The  reason  avowed  was  that  the  teacher, \nwho  was  black  and  a  plaintiff  in  the  suit,  had  publicly  expressed \nhis  agreement  with  the  District  Court  order.  The  job  was  with \nheld  until  the  prospective  appointee  signed  a  \"loyalty  oath.\" \nThe  District  Judge  held  a  hearing  June  ]6  and  ruled  on \n011 \n.Julle  20.  He  dediut'd  to  find  the  Board  in  contempt  but  did  note \nthat  \"[ t] he  board  does  not  adm it  nor  claim  that  it  has  any \npositive  duty  to  promote  desegregation.\"  The  .Tudge  also  re \ntumed  to  the  issue  of  gerrymandering  and  fOllnd  \"a long  standing \npolicy  of  control  over  the  makeup  of  school  population  which \nscare·ely  fits  any  true  'neighborhood  school  philosophy.''' \nOn  July  29,  the  Board  returned  with  a  new  plan.  The  District \nJudge  was  pleased  to  learn  that  \"the  School  Board  has  reversed \nits  field  and  has  accepted  its  affirmative  constitutional  duty  to \ndesegregate  pupils,  teachers,  principals  and  staff  members  'at  the \nearliest  possible  date'\"  In  view  of  this  declaration  and  of  the \nlate  date,  the  court  \"reluctalltly\"  approved  for  one  year  only  a \nplan  whereby  all  blul;k  inner-city  schools  would  be  closed \nsevell \nand  a  total  of  4245  black  children  bussed  to  outlying  white  schools. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n215n. \nOpi'ni011S  of  C01/rt  of  Apl)eals  dated  May  2(j, \n1970 \nAlbert V.  Bryan,  Circuit  Judge,  dissenting  in  part: \nThe  Court  commands  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board \nof  Education  to  provide  bussing  of  pupils  to  its  public \nschools  for  \"achieving  integration\".  (Accent  added.) \n\"[A]chieving  integration\"  is  the  phraseology  used,  but \nactually,  achieving  racial  balance  is  the  objective.  Bussing \n-\n_. \n. \n\" \nThe  B01!ru  was  direeteu  to  file  a  plan  for  complete  dsegregation  in \nNovember. \nBy  November,  the  District  Judge  was  Ilble  to  survey  the  results \nachieved  under  t.he  plan  adopted  for  the  year.  He  found  that \n\"ollly  1315  insteud  of  the  promised  4245  black  pupils\"  had  been \ntransferred.  (Laler  information  revealed  that  the  number  was \nonly  767.)  Furthermore,  he  fOlilld  that \nThe  Board  hilS  indicated  thnt  its  members  do  not  accept  the \nduty  to  desegregate  the  schools  at  any  ascertainable  time; \nand  they  have  clearly  indiclited  that  they  intend  not  to  do  it \neffective  in  the  fall  of  1970.  They  have  also  demonstrated  a \nyawning'  gap  between  predictions  and  pel'formllllce. \nOn  November  17,  the  Board  filed  a  plan.  It  \"discarded  further \nconsideratioll  of  pairing,  grouping,  clustering  and  transporting.\" \nOstel.lsibly  \"to  \\'oid  'tipping,'\"  the  provided  that  \",hite \nplHn \nII \nstudents  would  not  be  assigned  schools  where  they  would  find  them \nselves  with  less  than  60%  whites.  This  WIlS,  as  the  District  Court \nfOlwd,  a  one-way  street  in  view  of  the  fact  tllat  the  plan  contem \npJllted  no  effort  to  desegregate  school'!  with  greater  than  40% \nblack.,;.  The  plan  also  dropped  the  earlier  provision  of  transporta \ntion  for  students  transferring  out  of  segregated  situations.  Thus \nthe  Board  nullified  the  one  improvement  it  had  made  in  its  May  8 \nplan.  I t   also  left  t.hose  black  st.udents  who  had  transferred  to \noutlying  schools  pursuant  to  the  July  29  plan  without  transporta \ntion.  Understandably,  the  court  labeled  t.his  \"re-segregation.\" \nIn  t.he  face  of  this  total  lack  of  cooperation  on  t.he  part  of  the \nBoard,  the  court  was  com pelled  to  appoint  an  expert  to  devise  a \nplan  for  desegregation.  The  Finger  plan  was  the  result. \nIt  appears  from  the  record  that  all  most  issues  the  Board  was \nsharply  divided.  Of  course  I  mean  to  cast  no  Ilspersions  on  those \nmembers  and  there  were  some  who  Ul'ged  the  Board  forthrightly \nto  shoulder  its  duty.  But  the  above  recital  of  events  demonstrates \nbeyond  doubt  that  this  Board,  through  a  majority  of  its  members, \nfar  frol1l  making  \"every  reasonable  effort\"  to  fulfill  its  constitu \ntional  obligation,  has  resisted  and  delayed  desegregation  at  every \nturn. \n\n216a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nto  prevent  racial  imbalance  is  not  as  yet  a  Constitutional \nobligation.  Therefore, no  matter the  prior or present utiliz \nation  of  bussing  for  this  other  reasons,  and  regardless \n01' \nof  cost  considerations  or  duplication  of  t.he  bus  routes,  I \nthink  the  injullction  call1lot  stand. \nWithout  Constitutional  origin,  no  power  exists  in  the \nFederal  courts  to  order  the  Board  to  do  or  not  to  do  any \nthing.  I  read  no  authority  in  the  Constitution,  or  in  the \nimplications  of  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education,  347  US  483 \n(1954),  and  its  derivatives,  requiring  the  authorities  to \nendeavor  to  apportion  the  school  bodies  in  the  racial  ratio \nof  the  whole  school  system. \nThe  majority  opinion  presupposes  this  racial  balance, \nand  also  bussing  to  achieve  it,  as  Constitutional  impera \ntives,  but  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  United  States  has  re \ncently  suggested  inquiry  on  whether  \"any  particular  racial \nbalance  must be  achieved  in  the  schools;  , . .

They  inclllded  resort  to  a  desegre \ngation  plan based  on  geographical  zoning  wit.h  a  free  trans \nfer provision,  rather than  a  more positive method of achiev \ning  the  constitutional  objective,  the  failme  to  integrate \nfaculties,  the  existence  of  segregated  racial  patterns  par \ntially  as  a  result  of  federal,  state  and  local  governmental \naction  and  the  llse  of n  neighborhood  concept  for  the  loca \ntion  of schools  superimposed  upon  a  segregated  residential \npattern.  Correctly  the  majority  accepts  these  findings \nUD \nder  established  prillciples  of appellate  review.  To  illustrate \nhow  government-encouraged  residential  segregation,  cou \npled with  the  discriminatory location  and  design  of schools, \nresulted  in  a  dual  system,  the  majority  demonstrates  that \nin  this  locality  busing  has  been  employed  as  a  tool  to  per \npetuat.e  segregated  schools . \n-\n-\n• \nCertainly,  if  t.he  district  court's  order  with  respect  to  high \n>II \nschools  and  junior  high  schools  is  nffirmed,  the  district  court \nshould  1I0t  be  invited  to  reconsider  its  order  with  respect  to  them. \nThe  jurisdiction  of  the  district  court  is  continuing  and  it  may \nalways  modify  its  preyiolls  orders  with  respect  to  any  school  upon \napplication  Ilnd  for  good  causc  sho\\\\'1l. \n\n218a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  i.l1ay \n26,  1.970 \nIn  complete  compliance  with  Cat'fer  v.

S.  430  (1968),  and Monroe \nv.  Bd.  of Cornrn.'rs.,  391  U.  S.  450  (1968),  the  majority con \ncludes  that  the  existing  high  school  and  junior  high  school \nsystem must  be dismantled  and  that the  constitutional  man \ndate  can  be  met  by  the  use  of geographical  assignment,  in \ncluding  satellite  districts  and  busing. \nThe  majority  thus  holds  that  the  Constitution  requires \nI t  \nthat  this  dual  system  be  dismantled.  indicates  its  recog \nnition  of  the  need  to  overcome  the  discriminatory  educa \nIt \ntioual  effect  of  such  factors  as  residential  segregation. \nalso  approves  the  use  of  zones,  satellite  districts  and  re \nsultant  busing  for  the  achievement  of  a  unitary  system  at \nthe  high  school and  junior high  school  levels.  Nevertheless, \nthe  majority  disapproves  a  similar  plan  for  the  desegrega \ntion of the elementary schools  on  the ground that the busing \ninvolved  is  too  onerous.  I  believe  that  this  ground  is  in \nsubstantial  and  untenable. \nAt  the  outset,  it is well  to  remember  the  seminal  declara \nu. \ntion in Brown v.  Board  of Education  (Brown  II),  349  S. \n294,  300  (1955),  that in cases of  this  nature  trial  courts  are \nto  \"be  guided  by  equitable  principles\"  in  \"fashioning  and \neffectuating  decrees.\"  Since  Brown  II  the  course  of  deci \nsion  has not departed from  the underlying premise that this \nis  an  equitable  proceeding,  and  that the  district court is in \nvested  with  broad  discretion  to  frame  a  remedy  for  the \nwrongful  acts  which  the  majority  agrees  have  heen  com \nmitted.  In  Green  v.  School  Board  of  New  Kent  County, \n391  U.  S.  at  438,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  district \ncourts  not  only  have  the  \"power\"  but  the  \"duty  to  render \na  decree  which  will,  so  far  as  possible,  eliminate  the  dis-\n\n. \n-\n• \n219a \nOpi-nions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \ncriminatory  offects  of  the  past,  as  wen  as  bar like  discrimi \nnation  in  the  future.\"  District courts  were  directed  to  \"re \ntain  jurisdict.ion  until  it  is  clear  that  disestablishment  has \nBoard  U.

S.  218,  233  (1964).  Thus,  the  Supreme  Court  bas  made \nit  abundantly  cloar  that  the  district  courts  have  the  power, \nwen, \nand the duty  as  to fashion  equitable  remedies  designed \nto  C'xti rpa te  racial  segregation  in  t.he  hlic  schools.  And \npH \nill  fash ion ing  e'luita hIe  reI ief,  the  decree  of  a  district  court \nmust  be  sustained  unless  it  constitutes  a  clear  abuse  of \ntliscretion.  Um:ted  States  v.  W . .T .  Grant  Co ..  345  U.  S.  619 \n• \n(1953) . \nBusing  is  among  the  panoply of  devices  which  a  court  of \nequity  may  employ  in  fashiolling  an  equitable  remedy  in  a \ncase  of  this  type.  The  district  courf.'s  order  required  that \n\"transportatiOll  be  offered  on  a  uniform  llon-racial  basis \nto  al1  children  whose  attendance  in  any  school  is  necessary \nto  bring  about  reduction  of  segregation,  and  who  lives  far \nther  f\"om  t.he  school  to  which  t.hey  are  assigned  than  the \nIt \nBoard  determines  to  be  walking  distance.\"  found  as  a \nfact,  and  I  accept  its  finding,  that  \"thel'c  is  no  way\"  to  de \nsegregate  the  Charlotte  schools  in  the  heart  of  the  black \ncommunity  without  providing'  such  transportation. \nThe district. court's order is  neither  a  substantial  advance \n110r  extension  of  present  policy,  110r  on  this  record  does  it \nconstitute  an  nhnse  of  discretion.  This  school  system,  like \nmany  others,  is  actively  engaged  in  the  business  of \n110W \ntransporting  students  to  school.  Indeed,  busing  is  a  wide \nspread  practice  in  the  United  States.  U.  S.

Between  1954  and  1967  the number  of  pupils  using \nschool  transportation  has  increased  from  9,509,699  to \n17,271,718.

In United  States \nv.  Jefferson  Coulnty  Board  of  Education,  380  F.2d  385,  392 \ncert.  den.  Parrish \n(5  Cir.)  (en  banc),  sub.  nom.  Caddo \nEd.  U'1Z4ted  States, \nSchool  v.  389  U.  S.  840  (1967),  the  court \nordered  that  bus  service  which  was  \"generally  provided\" \nmust  be  routed  so  as  to  transport  every  student  \"to  the \nschool  to  which  he  is  assigned\"  provided  that  the  school \n\"is  sufficiently  distant  from  his  home  to  make  him  eligible \n• \nfor  transportation  under  generally  applicable  transporta-\ntion  rules.\"  Similarly,  in  United  States  v.  School  Dist.  151, \n286  F.  S.  786,  799  (N.D.  TIL  1968),  aff'd.,  404- F.2d  1125  (7 \nCir. 1968),  the  court said  that  remedying the  effects  of past \ndiscrimination  required  giving consideration  to  \"racial fac \ntors\" in  such matters as \"assigning students\" and providing \ntransportation  of  pupils.  In  addition,  the  Eighth  Circuit \nin  Kemp  v.  Beasley,  F.2d  (8  Cir.  1970),  recog \nnized  that  busing  is  \"one  possible  tool  in  the  implementa \ntion  of  unitary  schools.\"  And,  finally,  Griffin  v.  School \nBoard,  S'upra,  makes  it clear  that  the  added  cost  of  neces \nsary transportation  does  not  render a  plan objectionable. \nI  turn,  then,  to  the  extent  and  effect  of  busing  of  ele \nmentary  school  students  as  ordered  by  the  district  court. \nPresently,  23,600  students- .217'0  of the  total school  popu \nlation ..  are  bused,  excluding  some  5,000  pupils  who  travel \nto  and  from  school  by  public  transportation.  The  school \n\n• \n221a \nOpi-llions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nboard  operates  280  buses.  The  average  cost  of  busing  stu \ndents  is  $39.92  per  student,  of  which  one-half  is  borne  by \nthe  state  and  one-half \"by  the  board.  Thus,  the  average an \nBual cost to  the  boa1'd  is  about $20.00  pel'  student.  The total \nanllual  cost  to  the  board  for  busing  is  approximately \n$500,000.00 out of a  total operating budget of $51,000,000.00. \n% \nThe cost  of  busing is  thus less  than  1  of the  total  operat-\n\" \ning  budget.  and  an  even  smaller  percentage  of  the \n$57,700,000.00  which  this  school  district  expends  on  the \naggregate of operations,  capital outlay and debt service and \n2% \nthis  cost  also  represents  less  than  of  the  local  funds \nwhich  together  with  state and  federal  money constitute  the \nrevenue  available  annually  to  the  school  board. \nThe  total  number  of  elementary  school  pupils  presently \nbused  does  not  appear,  but  under  the  district  court's  order \nan  additional  9,300  elementary  school  pupils  would  be \nbused.  The  additional operating cost of busing  them  would \nnot  exceed  $1813,000.00  per  year.  They  ,Iiould  require  not \nmore  than  90  additional  bllses,  and  the  buses would  require \nan  addi tional  capital  outlay  of  $486,000.00.  The  increased \noperating  cost  of  the  additional  elementary  school  pupils \nrequired to  be bused  amounts  to less  than 170  of the board's \nschool  budget,  and  the  one·time  capital  outlays  for  addi \n% \ntional  buses  amo1111ts  to  less  than  1  of  the  board's  total \nbudget.  The  combined  operational  alld  capital  cost  repre \nsents less th[\\111.2%  of the board's total budget.  I  am, there \nfore,  unable  to  see  how  the  majority  could  consider  the \naddit.ional  cost  unbearable. \nPerhaps  mOre  importmltly,  the  tender  years  of  ele \nmentary  school  students  requires  a  consideration  of  the \n• \nimpact  of  the  dist.rict  court's  order  on  the  average  student. \nWhile  this  hoard  transports  21%  of  the  total  school  popu \nlation,  it  is  providing  transportation  to  a  far  lower  per-\n\n, \n222a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \ncentage  of  pupils  than  the  average  North  Carolina  school \nboard.  In  North  Carolina  54.970  of  the  average  daily  at \ntendance  in  the  public  schools  was  transported  by  bus  dur \ning  the  1968-69  school  year. \nThe  average  distance  traveled  by  elementary  school  pu \npils  presently  bused  does  not  appear,  but  thc  district court \nfound  overall  with  respect  to  the  children  required  to  be \nbused  by  its  order  that  they  \"will  lIot  as  a  group  travel  as \nfar,  nor  will  they  experience  more  inconvenience  than  the \nmore  than  28,000  children  who  are  already  being  trans \nported  \"While  the  district  court  did  not  make \nsep~ \n0  0  0.\" \narate  findings  with  regard  to  the  average  length  of  travel \nfor  the  additional  elementary  school  pupils  required  to  be \nbused,  it  did  -find  that  the  average  oIlc-way  bus  trip  in  the \nsystem  today  is  over  15  miles  in  length  and  takes  nearly \nan  hour  and  a  quarter.  In  contrast.,  the  court  found  that \nunder  its  plan  the  average  one-way  trip  for  elementary \nschool  students  would  be  less  thAn  7  miles  and  would \nre~ \nquire  not over  thirty-five  minutes. \nWhen  I  consider  that busing has been widely used in  this \nsystem  to  perpetuate  segregation,  that  some  busing  was \nproposed  even  under  the  unacceptable  board  pla.ns,  that \nthe  cost  of  additiona.l  busing  to  the  system  as  required  by \nthe  court's  order,  both  i11  absolute  terms  and  in  relation  to \nits  total expenditures is  so  minimal,  and  that the  impact on \nthe  elementary  school  pupils  is  so  slight,  I  discern no basis \nfor  concluding  that  the  district  court  abused  its  discretion \nwith  respect  to  the  elementary  school. \nTwo  other  aspects  of  the  majority's  opinion  require  my \ncomment. \nFirst,  the  majority  attempts  to  answer  the  query  of  the \nChief Justice in  his separate opinion  in  Northcross  v.  Board \n\n-\n• \n• \n223a \nMay \nOpill'ions  of  of  Appeals  dated  1970 \nCou,rt  26, \nof  Ed.  of  .Memphis,  U.  S.  (1970),  as  to  whether \n\"any  particular  racial  balance  must  be  achieved  ill  the \nschools\"  by  lJOlcling  \"that  not  every  school  in  nnitary \nR \nsystem  need  be  integrated'\"  •  \"'.\"  To  me,  the  hold \n~chool \ning  is  prematme  and  unwise.  There  is  not  in  this  case \neither  t.he  intractable  problem  of  a  vast.  urban  ghett.o  in  a \nlarge  or  substantial  basis  on  which  it  may  he  said \ncit~,  allY \nthat  the  cost  or  the  impact  the  system  or  the  pupils \n011  011 \nof dismantling  the  dual  system is  insupportable. \nThe  district  court  wisely  attempted  to  remedy  the  pres \nent  dunl  systelll  by  requiring  that  pupil  assignment  be \nbased  \"as  ncarly  as  practicahle\"  the  racial  composition \n011 \n% \nof  the  school  system,  71  wllite  and  29%  black.  The  plan \nordered  fell  short.  of  complete  reali;-:utioll  of  this  remedial \ngoal.  While  individual  schools  will  vary  in  racial  composi \n% \n370 \ntion  from  to  41  hlack,  most  schools  will  he  clust.ered \nIt \na  the  enti re  system's  overall  racial  mt.io.  would \nI'cllUld \nv \nseem  to  follow  from  United States  v.  Board  of \nil1ontgomc'ry \nEducatinu.  :395  U.  225,  232  (19G8),  that  the  district \n~. \ncourt's  ut.ilizatiOll  of  racial  ratios  to  dismantle  this  dual \nsystem  and  remedy  tho  effects  of  segregation  was  at  least \nwell  within  t,ile  range  of  its  discretion.  There  the  Supreme \nConrt  approved  as  a  requirement  of  faculty  integration \nt.hat  \"in  each  school  the  ratio  of  whit.e  to  Negro  faculty \nmembers  is  substantially  the  same  as  it  is  throughout  t.he \nsystem.\"  It.  did  so  recogllizing  that  it  had  pro\\'iously  said \nill  New  Kent,  391  D.  S.  at  439,  \"[t]bero  is  no  uni \nCowLf.y-, \nversal  answor  to  complex  problems  of desegregation;  thero \nis  obviously  no  one  plan  that  will  do  the  job  in  every  ease. \nThe  matter  must  bo  assessed  in  light  of  the  circumstances \npresent  and  the  options  available  in  each  instance.\"  I f  ill \na  proper  case  strict  application  of  a  ratio  is  an  approved \ndevice  to  achieve  facult.y  integration,  I  know  of  no  reason \n\n22 \n224a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dat.ed  May \n26,  1970 \nwhy  the same should not be  true to achieve pupil integration, \nespecially  where,  as  here,  Home  wide  deviations  from  the \noverall  ratio  have  been  permitted  to  accommodate  circum \nstances  witb  respect  to  particular schools. \nIn  addition  to  Mont.gom.ery,  the  same  conclusion  can  be \ndeduced  from  the  mandate  of  Wes/.  Fel-icimln  and  Holmes \nCounty  to  dismantle  immediately  a  dual  system.  Schools \ncease  to  be  black  or  whit.e  when  each  reflects  the  overall \npupil  racial  balance  of tbe entire  system.  What  imbalances \nmay be  justified after a  unitary system bas  once  been  estab \nlished,  and  what  departures  from  an  overall  pupil  racial \nhalance  may  be  permitted  to  accommodate  special  circum \nstances  in  the  establishment of  a  unitary system,  should  be \ndeveloped  a  case-by-case  hasis  and  the  facts  of  record \n011 \nwbich  each  case  presents. \nThe other aspect of the majority's opinion which  troubles \nme greatly is  its establishment of the test  of reasonableness. \nMy objections  to  t.his  test  do 110t  spring from  any  desire  to \nimpose  1lnreasonable,  irrational  or  onerous  solutions  on \nschool  systems;  I,  too,  seek  \"reasonable\"  means  with  which \nto  achieve  the  constitutionally  required  objective  of  a  uni \ntary  system. \nMy ohjections  are  two-fold. \nFirst,  tbis  is  an  inappropriate  case  in  which  to  establish \nthe  test.  On  this  record  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  hoard \nacted  reasonabl.y   or  that  there  is  an-y viable  solution  to  the \ndismantling of the dual  system other than  the one fashioned \nbv  the  district  court.  Neither  the  board  nor  HEW  has \n-\nsuggested  one.  So  that,  again,  I  think  the  majority  is  pre \nmature in  its pronouncement and I  would  find  no  occasion to \ndiscuss  reasonableness when  there is  no  choice  of  remedies. \nSecond,  tbe  majority sets fortb  no  standards  by  which  to \njlldge  reasonableness  or  unreasonableness.  The  majority \n\n- -\n• \n225a \nMay \nOp'iniOlls  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  26,  1970 \n• \nappl'o\\-es  the  district  court's  plan  as  to  high  schools  and \njunior  high  schools,  yet  disapproves  as  to  elementary \nschools.  rrhe  only  differences  are  increased  busing  with \nattendant  increased  cost,  time  and  distance.  Tho  majority \nsubjectively  concludes  that  these  costs  arc  too  great  to \npermit  the  enforcement  of  the  constitutional  right  to  a \nunitary  system_  I  would  find  them  neither  prohibitive \n1101' \nBut,  of \nrelatively  disproportionate.  with  the  absence  stan \ndards,  how  are  the  school  boards  or  courts  to  know  what \nplans  are  reasonable?  The  conscientious  board  cannot  de \ntermino  whon  it  is  ill  compliance.  The  dilatory  board  re \nceives  an  open  invitation  to  further  litigation  and  delay. \nFinally,  I  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  \"I'easonableness\" \nhas  more  than  faint  resemblance  to  the  good  faith  test  of \nBt-ow'n  ll.  Tho  13  years  between  Brown 1l and  N eU)  Ken!. \nCounty  amply  demonstrate  that  this  test  did  110t  work. \nUltimately  it  was  required  to  be  rejected  ano  to  ha\\'e  sub \nstituted  for  it  the  absolute  of  \"now\"  and  \"at.  once.\"  The \nmajority  ignol'es  this  lesson  of  history.  I f  a  constitutional \nright  exists,  it  should  be  enforced.  On  this  record  the  con \nstitutional  of  school  pupils  should \nrights  elementary  be \nenforced  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the  district  court, \nbecause  it  is  clear  that  the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its \ndiscretion . \n•J udge  Sobeloff  authorizes  me  to  say  that  he  joins  In \nthese  views. \n\nr - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .. \n226a \nJudgment  of  Court  of  Appeals \ndated  May  26,  1970 \nThis  cause .came  on  to  be  heard  on  the  l'ecord  from  the \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  ·Western  District  of \nNorth  Carolina,  and  was  argued  by  counsel. \nOn  considerat.ion  whereof,  it  is  and \nORDERED  An.JUDGED \nthat  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court  appealed  from, \nin  this  case,  be,  and  the  same  is  hereby,  vacated;  and  the \ncase  is  remanded  to  the  United  States  District  Court  for \nthe  Western  District  of  North  Carolina,  at  Charlotte,  for \nfurther  proceedings. \nJudge  Bryan  joins  Haynsworth,  C. •J  .

(1964),  to  consider  a  single  as \npect  of  the  above-captioned  case:  the  constitutionality  and \nimpact of a  state statute, N.  C.  Gen.  Stat. § 115-176.1  (Supp. \n1969),  known  as  the  nntilJUssing  law,  on  this  suit  brought \nto  desegregate  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  school  system. \nWe  hold  a  portion  of  N.  C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 115-176.1  unconsti \ntutional  because  it  may  interfere  with  the  school  board's \nperformance of its affirmative  constitutional duty under  the \nequal  protection  clause  of  t.he  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nI. \nOn  February  5,  1970,  the district  court  entered  an  order \nrequiring  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School  Board  to  de-\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n229a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Co1trt  duted  April \n29,  1970 \nsegregate  its  school  system  according  to  a  court-approved \n·plan.  Implementation  of  the  plan  could  require  that  13,300 \nadditional  children  be  bussed.  This,  in  turn,  could  require \nI \nnp  to  138  additional  school  buses. \n~ \nPrior  to  the  February  5  order,  certain  parties  filed  a \nsuit,  entitled  Torn  B.  Ha.rris,  G.  Don  Roberson,  et  al.  v. \nWillimn  C.  Self,  Superintendent  of  CharloUe-M \necklenb~(,rg \nSchools  m1d  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of  Education.,  in \nthe  Superior  Court of Mecklenburg  County,  a  court of gen \neral jurisdietion  of the  State of North Carolina.  Part of  the \nrelief  sought  was  an  order  enjoining  the  expenditure  of \npublic funds  to  purchase,  rent or operate any  motor vehicle \nfor  the  purpose  of  transporting  students  pursuant  to  a \ndesegregation  plan.  A  temporary  restraining  order  grant \ning  this  relief  was  entered  by  the  state  court,  and,  in  re \nsponse,  the Swann  plaintiffs moved  the district court to  add \nthe  state  plaintiffs  as  additional  parties  defendant  in  the \nfederal  suit,  to  dissolve  the  state  restraining  order,  and \nto  direct  all  parties  to  cease  interfeJ·ing  with  the  federal \ncourt  lIHindates.  Because  it appeared  that  the  constitution \nality  of  N.  C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 115-176.1  (Supp.  1969)  would  be \nin  question,  the  district court  requested  designation  of  this \nthree-judge  court  on  February  19,  1970.  On  Februa.ry  25, \n1970, the district judge granted the motion  to  add additional \nparties.  :Meanwhile,  on  February  22,  1970,  another  state \nsuit,  styled  1I1rs.

For  our  purposes,  it  is  imma \nterial  whose  figures  are  correct.  The  figures  quoted  are  taken \nfrom  the  jUl]ge's  supplemental  findings  of  fact,  filed  March \ndi~trict \n21,  1970. \n\n230a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  Dist.rict  Court  dated  April  29,  1970 \nMecklen.burg  Board  of  Education  and  W·illiam  C.  Self, \nSuperintendent  of  Ch4rlotte-Mecklenburg  Schools,  was  be \ngun.  In  this  second  state  snit,  the  plaintiffs  also  requested \nan  order  enjoining  the  school  board  and  superintendent \nfrom  implementing  the  plan  ordered  hy  the  tlistrict  court \non  February  5.  The  state  court  judge  issued  a  temporary \nrestrai.ni.ng  order  ern bodyi ng  the  relief  reqllcRted,  and  on \nFebruary 26,  1970,  the  Swa'tvn  plaintiffs  moved  to  add Mrs. \nMoore,  ct  ai.,  as  additional  parties  defendant in  the  federal \nsuit.  On  the  same day,  the  state  defendants  filed  a  petition \nfor  removal  of  the  Moore  suit  to  federal  court.  On  March \n23,  1970,  the  district  judge  requested  a  three-judge  court \nin  the  removed  Moore  case,  and  this  panel  was  desihrnated \nto  hear  the  matter.  An  the  cases  were  consolidtaed  for \nhearing,  and  the  court  heard  argument  by  all  parties  on \nMarch  24,  1970. \nII. \nN.  C.  Gen.  Stnt.  § 115-176.1  (Supp.  1969)  reads: \nAssignment  of  pupils  based  all  race,  creed,  color  or \nnational  origin prohibited.  No  person  shall be  refused \nadmission  into  or  be  excluded  from  any  public  school \nin  this State on  account of race,  creed,  color or national \norigin.  No  school  attendance  district  zone  shall  be \n01' \ndrawn  for  the  purpose  of  segregating  persons  of vari \nous  races,  creeds,  colors  or  national  originR  from  the \ncommunity. \nWhere  administrative  units  have  divided  the  geo \ngraphic  urea  into  attendance  districts  or  zones,  pupils \nRhall  be  assigned  to  schools  within  snch  attendance \ndistricts;  provided,  however,  tbat  the  hoard  of  educa \ntion  of  an  administrative  unit  may  assign  any  pupil \nto  a  school  outside  of  snch  attendance  district  or  zone \nin  order  that  such  pupil  may  attend  a  school  of  a \n\n- - - - - - - -\n2313, \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nspecialized  kind  including  but  not  limited  to  a  voca \ntional  scbool  or  school  oporat.ed  for,  or  operating  pro \ngrams  for,  pupils  mentally  or  physically  handicapped, \nor  for  any  other  reason  which  the  board  of  education \nin  its  discretion  deems  sufficient.  No  student  shall \n~ole \nbe  assigned  or  compelled  to  attend  any  school  on  ac \ncount  of  race,  creed,  color  or  national  origin,  or  for \ntbe  purpose  of  creating  a  balance  or  ratio  of  race,  re \nligion  or  national  origins.  Involuntary  bussing  of  stu \ndonts  in  contravention  of  this  article  is  prohibited,  and \npublic  funds  shall  not  be  used  for  any  such  bussing. \na \nThe  provisions  of  this  article  shall  not  apply  to \ntemporary  assignment  due  to  the  nnsuitability  of  a \nschool for  its  intended  purpose  nOr  to  any  assignment \ntransfer  necessitated  by  overcrowded  conditions  or \n01' \notber circumstances  which,  in the  sole  discretion  of  the \nschool  lloard,  require  Ilssignment  reassignment. \n01' \nThe  provisions  of  this  al'ticle  shall  not  apply  to  an \napplication  for  the  assignment  or  reassignment  by  the \nparent,  guardian or person standing  in  loco  parentis  of \nany  pupil  or  to  any  assignment  made  pursuant  to  a \nchoice  made  by  any  pupil  who  is  eligible  to  make  such \nchoice pursuant to the provisions of a  freedom  of choice \nplan  voluntarily  adopted  by  the  board  of  education  of \nan  administrative  unit. \nI t  is  urged  upon  us  that  the  statute is  far  from  clear and \nmay  reasonably  be  interpreted  several  different  ways. \n, \n(A)  Plaintiffs  read  the  statute  to  mean  that  the \nschool board is prevented from  complying with  its  duty \nunder  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  establish  a  uni \ntary  school  system.  See,  e.g.,  Green  v.  C(JU,nty  School \nEd.  of N cw  Kent  Cmmty,  391  U.S.  430,  439  (1968).  In \n• \n• \n\n232a \nof  Dist-rict  Court  April \nOrder  Three-Judge  dated \n29,  1970 \nsupport  of  this  contention,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the \nNorth  Carolina  General  Assembly  passed  § 115-176.1 \nin  response  to  an  April  23,  1969,  district  court  order, \nwhich  required  the  school  board  to  submit  a  plan  to \ndesegregate the  Charlotte schools for the 1969-70  school \nyear.  Under  plaintiffs'  interpretation  of  the  statute, \nis  denied  non \nthe  board  all  desegregation  tools  except \ngerrymandered  geographic  zoning  and  frecuom  of \nchoice.  Implicit in this,  of course,  is  the suggestion that \nzoning  and  frcdom  of  choice  will  be  ineffective  in  the \nCharlotte  context  to  disestablish  the  asserted  duality \nof  the  present  system. \n(B)  The  North  Carolina  Attorney  General  argues \nthat  the  statute  was  passed  to  preserve  the  neighbor \nhood  school  concept.  Under  his  interpretation,  the \nstatute  prohibits  assignment  and  bussing  inconsistent \nwith  the  neighborhood  school  concept.  Thus,  to  dis \nestablish  a  dual  system  the  district  court  could,  con \nsistent  with  the  statute,  only  order  the  board  to  geo \ngraphically zone  the attendance areas  that, as nearly \nSO \nas  possihle,  each  student  would  be  assigned  to  the \nschool  nearest  his  home  regardless  of  his  race.  Im \nplicit  in  this  argument  is  that  any  school  system  is \nper  se  unitary if it is  zoned  according  to  neighborhood \npatterns  that are  not  the  result  of  officially  sanctioned \nracial  discrimination.  Although  the  Attorney  General \nemphasizes the  expression  of state  policy  by the Legis \nlature  in  favor  of  the  neighborhood  school  concept,  he \nrecognizes,  of  course,  that  the  statute  also  permits \nfreedom  of choice  if  a  school  bORrd  voluntarily adopts \nsuch  a plan.  Thus, the  plaintiffs  and  the  Attorney Gen \neral  read  the  statute  in  much  the  same  way:  that  it \nlimits  lawful  methods  of  accomplishing  desegregation \n\n- - - - - - - -\n233a \nOrde1·  of  Three·Judge  District  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nto  nongerrymundered  geographic  zoning  and  freedom \nof choice. \n(0)  The  school  board's  interpretation  of  the  statute \nis  more  ingenious.  The board concedes  that the  statute \nto \nprohibits  assignment  according  to  race,  assignment \nachieve  racial. balance,  and  involuntary  bussing  for \neither  of  these  purposes,  but  contends  that  the  facial \nprohibitions  of  the  statute  onJy  apply  to  prevent  a \nschool  board  from  doing  more  than  necessary  to \n.  attain  a  unitary  system.  The  argument  is  that  since \nthe  statute  only  begins  to  operate  once  a  unitary \nsystem  has  been  established,  it  in  no  way  interferes \nwith  the  board's  constitutional  duty  to  desegregate \nthe  schools.  Counsel  goes  on  to  insist  that  Oharlotte \nMecklenburg  presently  has  a  unitary  system  and, \ntherefore,  that  the  state  court  constitutionally  applied \nthe  statute  to  prevent  fnrther  unnecessary  racial \nbalancing. \n(D)  Plaintiffs  in  the  Harris  suit  contend  (1)  that \n% \nin  42  U.S.C.  2000c(b)  and  2000c-6(a)(2)  (1964)3 \n§ 2000c: \n3 \nAs  used  in  this  subcbapter-\n•  •  •  •  • \n• \n(b)  \"Desegregation\"  means  the  assignment  of  students  to \npublic  schools  anil  within  such  schools  without  regard  to  their \nrace,  eolor.  religion,  or  national  origin,  but  \"desegregation\" \nshall  not  mean  the  assignment  of  studenu,  to  public  schools \nin  order  to  overcome  racial  imbalance. \n§ 2000c-6 (a)  : \n(2)  [P] rovided  that  not.hing  herein  sha 11  empower  any  offi \ncial  or  court  of  the  United  States  to  issue  any  order  seeking \nto  achieve  a  racial  balance  III  any  school  by  requiring  the \ntrunsportatioll  of  pupils  or  students  from  one  school  to \n[lllother  or  one  sehool  dist.rict  to  another  in  order  to  achieve \nracial  ba.lance.  or  otherwise  enlarge  the  existing  power \nslIch \nof  the court to  insure compliallce  with  constitutioual  standards. \n\n234a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Court  date(Z  Apr-il \n29,  1970 \nCongress  expressly prohibited  assignment  and  bussing \nto  achieve  racial  balance,  (2)  that  to  compel  a  child \nto  attend  a  school  on  account  of  his  race  or  to  com \npel  him  to  be  involuntarily  bussed  to  achieve  a  racial \nbalance  violates  the  principle  of  Brown  v.  Ed.  of  Ed_ \nof Topeka, 347  U.S. 483  (1954),  and  (3)  that N.  C.  Gen. \nStat.  115-176.1  merely  embodies  the  principle  of  the \n§ \nlleighborhood  school  in  accordance  with  Brown  and \nthe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.  'Ve  may  dispose  of  the \nfirst  contention  at  once.  The  st.atnte  \"cannot  be  in \nterpreted  to  frustrate  the  constitutional  prohibition \n[against segregated schools].\"  United  State.s  v.  School \nDist.  of  Cook  Co.,  404  F.2d  1125,  1130  (7th  Cir. \n151 \n1968). \n(E)  Plaintiffs  in  the  Moore  suit  argue  that  the \ndistrict  court  order  of  February  5,  1970,  was  in \ncontravention  of Brown  and,  therefore,  that  the  state \ncourt  order  in  their  suit  was  justified.  However,  the \nMoore  plaintiffs  also  argue  that  certain  parts  of  the \nsecond  and  third  paragraphs  ill  the  state  statute  are \nunconstitutional  because  they  give  the  school  board \nthe  authority  to  assign  children  to  schools  for  what \never  reasons  the  board  deems  necessary  or  sufficient. \nThe  Moore  plaintiffs  interpret  these  portions  of  the \nstatute  as  permitting  assignment  and  bussing  on  the \nbasis  of  race  contrary  to  Brown  and  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nIII. \nFederal  courts  are  reluctant,  as  a  matter  of  comity  and \nrespect  for  state  legislative  judgment  and  discretion,  to \nstrike down  state  statutes  as  l1TIconstitutional,  and  will  not \ndo  so if the  statute  reasonably can be  interpreted  so  as  not \n\n----- - - - - - - ----- -------- - - - - - - - - -\n-\n2.35n \nOrder  of  .Three-Judge  Dist1'ic/.

But  to  read  the \nstatute  as  innocuously  as  the  school  board  suggests  would, \nwe  think,  distort and  twist the  legislative  intent.  ·We  agree \nwith  plaintiffs  and  the  Attomey  General  that  the  statute \nlimits  the  remedies  otherwise  available  to  school  hoards \nto  desegregat.e  the  schools.  The  harder question  is whether \nthe  limitation  is  valid  or  conflicts  wit.h  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  We  think  the question  is ]10t  so  easy,  and  the \nstatute  not  so  obviously  uIlconstitutional,  that  the  question \nmay  lawfully  be  answered  by  a  single  federal  judge,  sec \nTurner  City  of Memphis,  369  U.S.  350  (1962);  Bailey  v. \nY. \nPatte.rson.,  369  U.S.  31  (1962),  and  we  reject  plaintiffs' \nattack  upon  our  jurisdiction.

Bd.  of  New  Kent  Co.,  391 \nU.S.  430  (1968),  the  Supreme  Court  declared  that  a  school \nboard  must take  effective action  to  establish  a  unitary,  nOll \nracial  system,  if  it  is  not  already  operating  such  a  system. \nThe  Court.  neither  prohibited  nor  prescribed  specific  types \nof plans,  but,  rather,  emphasized  that  it  would  judge  each \nplan  by  its  ultimate  effectiveness  in  achieving  desegrega \nIn \ntion.  Green  itself,  the  Court  held  a  freedom-of-choice \nplan  insufficient  because  the  plan  left  the  school  system \nsegregated,  but  stated  that,  under  the  circumstances  exist \ning  in  New  Kent  County,  it appeared  that  the  school  hoard \ncould  acbieve  a  unitary  system  either  by  simple  geo \ngraphical  zoning  or  by  consolidating  the  two  schools  in \nvolved  in  tbe  case.  391  U.S.  at 442,  n.  6.  Under  Green  and \nsubseqnent  decisions,  it  is  clear  that  school  boards  must \nto \n-implement  plans  that  work  achieve  unitary  systems. \n:Northcross  v.

Plans  that  do  not \nproduce  a  unitary  system  are \nunacccptable.~ \nWe  think  the  enunciation  of  policy  by  the  legislature \nof the  State  of  North  Carolina  is  entitled  to  great  respect. \nFederalism  requires  that whenever  it is  possible  to  achieve \na  unitary  system  within  a  framework  of  neighborhood \nschools,  a  federal  court ought not  to  require other remedies \nin derogation  of state  policy.  But if  in  a  given  fact context \nthe  state's  expressed  preference  for  the  neighborhood \nschool  cannot  be  honored  without  preventing  a  unitary \nsystem,  it  is  tho  former  policy  which  must  yield  under \nthe  Supremacy  Clause. \nStated  differently,  a  statute  favoring  the  neighborhood \nschool concept, freedom-of-choice  plans,  or both can  validly \nlimit  a  school  board's  choice  of  remedy  only  if  the  policy \nfavored will  not prevent the  operation  of a  unitary  system. \nThat  it  mayor  may  not  depends  upon  the  facts  in  a \nparticular school  system.  The  flaw  in  this  legislation  is  its \nrigidity.  As  an  expression  of  state  policy,  it  is  valid.

The  first  paragraph \nof  the  statute  reads: \nN a  person  shall  be  refused  admission  into  or  be \nexcluded  from  any  public  school  in  this  State  on \naccount  of  race,  creed,  color  or  national  origin.  No \nschool  attendance  district  or  zone  shall  be  drawn  for \nthe  purpose  of  segregating  persons  of  various  races, \ncreeds,  colors  or national origins  from  the  community. \nThere  is  nothing  uncollstitutional  in  this  paragraph.  I t  \nis  merely  a  restatement  of  the  principle  announced  in \nBt'own  v.  Bd.  of  Ed.  of  Topeka,  347  U.S.  483  (1954) \n(Brown.  I). \nThe  third  paragraph  of  the  statute  reads: \nThe  pJ\"Ovisiolls  of  this  article  shall  not  apply  to  a \ntemporary  assignment  due  to  the  unsuitability  of  a \nschool  for  its  intended  purpose  nor  to  any  assignment \nor  transfer  necessitated  by  overcrowded  conditions  or \ncircumsta1lces  which,  in  the sole discretion  of the school \nboard,  require  assiglIDlent  or  reassignment. \nThis  paragraph  merely  allows  the  school  board  1I0ninvidi \nom;  discretion  to  assign  students  to  schools  for  valid  ad \nministrative  reasons.  As  wo  read  it,  it  does  not  relate \nto  race  at  all  and,  so  read,  is  constitutional. \nThe  fourt.h  paragraph  provides: \nThe  provisions  of  tbis  article  shall  not  apply  to  an \napplicat.ion  for  the  assigl1ment  or  reassignment  by  the \nparent,  guardian  or  person  standing  in  loco  parentis \n\n238a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Cou.rt  dated  Ap·ril \n29,  1970 \nof  any  pupil  or  to  any  assignment  made  pursuant  to \na  choice made by  any pupil  who  is  eligible  to  make  snch \nchoice pnrsuant to  the provisions of a  freedom  of choice \nplan  voluntarily  adopted  by  the  board  of  education  of \nan admini8trative unit. \nThis  paragraph  relieves  school  boards  from  compliance \nwith  the  statute  where  they  are  implementing  voluntarily \nadopted  freedom-of-choice  plans  within  their  systems.

It  reads: \nWhere  administrativc  units  have  divided  the  geo \ngraphic  area  into  attendance  districts  Or  zones,  pupils \nshall  be  assigned  to  schools  within  such  attendance \ndistricts;  provided,  however,  that  the  board  of  educa \ntion  of  an  administrative  unit  may  assign  any  pupil \nto  a  school  outside  of  snch  attendance  district  or  zone \nin  order  that  such  pupil  may  attend  a  school  of  a \nspecialized  kind  including  but  not  limited  to  a  voca \nt.ional  school  or  schoo]  operated  for,  or  operating  pro \ngrams  for,  pupils  mentally  or  physically  handicapped, \nor  for  any  other  reason  which  the  hoard  of  education \nin  its  sole  discretion  deems  sufficient.

They  plainly  prohihit  school  hoards from \nassigning,  compelling,  hussing  students \nOJ'  involuntRril~' \naccount  of  raCD,  or  in  order  to  racially  \"balance\"  the \n011 \n• \nschool  system.  Oree·Jl.  v.  School  Bd.  of  New  Kent  Co.}  391 \nU.S.  4-30  (] 968),  Hrown  v.  Bd.  of  Ed.  of  T02Jeka ..  349  U.S. \n294  (1955)  (Brown II), and Brown v.  Bd.  of Ed.  of Topeka .. \n347  U.S.  483  (1954)  (Brown  I),  require  school  boards  to \nconsider  race  for  the  purpose  of  disestablishing  dual \n•  systems. \nThe  Oonstitution  is  not  color-blind  with  respect  to  the \naffirmative  dut.y  to  establish  and  operate  a  unitary  school \nsystem.  To  say  that  it  is  would  make  t.he  constitutional \nprinciple  of  Brown  I  and  II  an  abstract  principle  instead \nof  an  operative  one.  A  flat  prohibition  against  assignment \nby  race would,  as  a  practical  mat.ter,  prevent  school  boards \n£l'Om  altering  existing  dual  systems.  Consequently,  the \nstatute  clearly  contravenes  the  Supreme  Court's  direction \n\n240a \nOJ'der  of  Three-Judge  Distr-ict  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nthat  boa rds  must  take  steps  adequat.e  to  abolish  dual  sys \ntems.  See  Green  v.  School  Bel.  of  K cnt  Co.,  391  U.S.  430, \n437  (1968).  As  far  as  the  prohibition  against  racial  \"bal \nance\"  is  concerned,  a  school  board,  in  taking  affirmative \nsteps  to  desegregate  its  systems,  must  always  engage  in \nsome  degree  of  balancing.  The  degree  of  racial  \"balance\" \nnecessary  to  establish  a  unitary  system  under  given  cir \ncumstances  is  not  yet  clear,  see  N o-rtl/cross  v.  Bd.  of  Ed. \nof  the  Memphis  City  Schools,  U.S.  ,  38  L.W.  at \n4220  (1970)  (Chief  .T usticc  Burger  concurring),  but  be \ncause  any  method  of  school  desegregation  involves  selec \ntion  of  zones  and  transfer  and  assigllment  of  pupils  by \nrace,  a  flat  prohibition  against  racial  \"balance\"  violate!;  the \nequal  protection  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nFinally,  the  statute's  prohibition  against  \"involuntary \nbussing\"  also  violat.es  the  equal  protection  clause.  Bussing \nmay  not  he  necessary  to  eliminate  a  dual  system  and  es \ntablish  a  unitary  one  in  a  given  case,  but  we  think  the \nLegislature  went  too  far  when  it  undertook  to  prohibit  its \nuse  in  all  factual  contexts.  To  say  that  bussing  shall  not \nbe  resorted  to  unless  unavoidable  is  a  valid  expression  of \nstate  policy,  but  to  flatly  prohibit  it  regardless  of  cost, \nextent  and  all  other  factors  including  willingness  of  a \nschool  board  to  experiment  contravenes,  we  think,  the \nimplicit  mandate  of  Green.  that  all  reasonable  methods  be \navailable  to  implement  a  unitary  system. \nAlthough  we  hold  these  statutory  prohibitions  uncon \nstitutional  as  ,;olative  of  equal  protection,  it  does  not \nfollow  that  \"bussing\" will  be  an  appropriate  remedy  in  any \nparticular  school  desegregation  case.  On  this  issue  we \nexpress  no  opinion,  for  the  question  is  now  on  appeal \nto  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fourth \nCircuit  and  is  not  for  us  to  decide. \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n241.a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  Dis/.\"'Let  Court  dated  A2)l'i/, \n29,  1970 \nI t  is  clear  that  each  case  must  be  analyzed  on  its  own \n• \nfacts.  Sec  Gree'n  v.  School  Bd.  of New  Kent  Co.,  391  U.S. \n430  (1968).  The  legitimacy  of  t.he  solutions  proposed  and \nordered  in  each  case  must  be  judged  against  the  facts  of \nparticular  school  system.  We  merely  hold  today  that \nR \nN ort.h  Carol i na  may  not  validly  enact  laws  that  prevent \nthe  utilization  of  any  reasonable  method  otherwise  avail \nable  to  establish  unitary  school  systems.  Its  effort  to  do \nso  is  struck  down  by  the  equal  protection  clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause  (Article \n2  of  the  Constitution). \nv \nAs we  have  no  cause  to doubt  the  sincerity  of the  various \n• \ndefendants,  the  plaintiffs'  Illotion  to  hold  thcm  in  contempt \nfor  interference  with  the  district  court's  orders  and  their \nrequest  a1l  injullction  against enforcement of the  statnte \nfOI' \nwill  be  denied.  We  believe  the  defendants,  including  the \nstate  court  plaintiffs,  will,  pending  appeal,  respect  this \ncourt's  judgment,  which  applies  statewide  with  respect  to \nthe  constitutionalitv  of  the  statute . \n• \nSeveral  of  tho  parties  have  moved  to  IJe  dismissed  from \nthe  case,  alleging  various  grounds  in  support  of  their \nmotions.  Because  of  the  view  we  take  of  this  suit  and  the \nlimiteu  relief  we  grant,  the  motions  to  dismiss  become  im \nmaterial.  The  school  board  is  undeniably  a  proper  party \nbefore  the  court  on  the  constitutional  issue,  since  it  is  a \npurty  to  the  desegregation  suit.  We  can,  therefore,  con \nsider  alld  adjudge  thc  validity  of  the  statute,  rcgardle!:is  of \nthe  of  the  other  parties.  That  we  consider  the \npo~ition \nsubstantive  arguments  of  all  the  parties  in  no  way  harms \nthose  who  have  moved  to  he  dismissed. \nAn  appropriate  judgment  will  be  entered  in  accordance \nwith  this  opinion.

A  hearing  was  conducted \non  August  5,  1969.  The  plan  is  before  the  court  for  ap \nproval. \nBecause  the  schools  must  open  September  2,  and  because \nthe  Board's  plan includes  both  substantial  action  and  gen \nuine  assurance  of  sustained  effort  t.oward  prompt  compli \nance  with  the  law  of  the  land,  the  plan  of  operation,  for \n1969-70  only,  is  approved  and as  indicated below,  the defen \ndants  are  directed  to  prepare  and  file  by  November  17, \n1969,  detailed plans and  undertakings for  completion  of the \njob  of  desegregating  the  schools  effective  in  September, \n1970. \nITs \nTHE  AMENDED  PLA N  AND  RECEPTION \nThe  plan  proposes,  among  other  things,  to  close  seven \nold  all-black  inner-city  schools  and  to  assigll  their  3,000 \nstudents  to  various  outlying  schools,  now  predominantly \n·white,  mostly  in  high  rent  districts. \nThis  technique  of  school  closing  and  reassignment  has \nbeen  employed  in  dozens  of  school  districts  to  promote \nschool desegregation.  I t  is not original with the local School \nBoard. \nThe  school  closing  issue  has  provoked  strident  protests \nfrom  black  citizens  and  from  others;  evidence  showed  that \n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n-~----------\n• \n59a \nOrder  dated \nA'll.fJUst  15,  1.969 \nan  estimated  19,000  names  are listed  on  a  petition  denounc \ning the  plan  as  unfair  and  discriminatory.  The  signers  add \ntheir  own  brand  of  protest  to  tbat  of  the  21,000  whites  who \nlast.  May  (though  protestillg  their acceptance  of  the  princi \nples  of  desegregation)  raised  a  \"silk-stocking\"  community \noutcry  against  bus  transportation  except  to  schools  of  in \ndividual  choice.  Another  800  white  Paw  Creek  lJetitioners \nhave  joined  in  protest  against  a  part  of  the  plan  under \nwhich  some  200  fifth  and  sixth  grade  pupils  would  be  as \nsigned  to  re-opened Woodland, a  new  unused  (and formerly \nblack)  school.  Comment  from  people.  who  have  not  studied \nthe  evidence  tends  to  igIlore  the  law  the  reason  this  ques \ntion  is  before  a  for  decision  and  to  concentrate  on \nVOltrt \npublic  acceptance  what  will  make  people  happy.  A  cor \n01' \nrespondent who  signs  \"Puzzled\"  inquires: \n\" I f  the  whites  don't want  it and  the  blacks  don't want  it, \nwhy  do  have  to  have  it Y\" \nwe \nThe  answer  is,  the  Constitution  of  the United  States. \nTHE  CONSTITU1'ION  . THE  LAW  OF  THE  LAND  REQUIRES \nDESEGREGATION\"  OF  PUBLIC  SCHOOLS \nNorth  Carolina  reportedly  refused  to  ratify  the  United \nStates  Constitution  until  the  Bill  of  Rights  had  been  in \ncorporated  into  it.  The  Foul'teenth  A.mcll(lment  to  that \nBill \nConstitution,  part of  the  of  Rights,  guarantees  to \n1I0W \nall  citizens  the  \"equal  protection  of  laws.\"  In  Brown \nY. \nBoard  of  Education,  347  U.  S.  483  (1954-),  349  U.  S.  294 \n(1955),  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  racial  segregation  in \npublic  schools  produces  inferior  education  and  morale,  re \nstricts  opportunity  for  association,  and  thus  violates  the \nequal  protection  guaranty  of  the  Constitution  and  is  un \nlawful.  In  Green  ,.  New  Kent  County  School  Board,  391 \n\n60a \nOrder  dated  August \n15, 1969 \nU.  S.  430  (1968),  and  two  other  simultaneouo  unanimous \ndecisions,  t.he  Supreme  Court  held  that  school  boards  have \nthe  affirmative  to  get  rid  of  dual  school  systems,  to \nduty \neliminate  \"black  schools\"  and  \"white  schools,\"  and  to  oper \nate  \"just  schools.\"  The  Court  said; \n\"The burden  on  a  school  board today is  to  come  forward \nwith  a  plan  that  promises  realistically  to  work  and \npromises  realistically  to  work  now.\"  (Emphasis  on  the \nword \"now\"  was  put in  the  text by the  Supreme Court.) \nFa)' years people of this community and all over the  south \nhave  quoted  wistfully  the  statement in Briggs  v.  Elliott  by \nJudge  John  J. Parker  (who  at his death  was  one  of my few \nremaining  heroes)  that  though  the  Constitution  forbids \nsegregation  it  does  not  require  integration.  Passage  of \ntime, and the  revelation of conditions which might well have \nchanged  .Judge  Parker's  views  if  he  had  lived,  have  left \nJudge  Parker's  words  as  a  landmark  but no  longer  a  guide. \nThe  latest  decision  on  this  subject  by  the  Fourth  Circuit \nCourt  of  Appeals  (which  is  the  court  that first.  reviews  my \nact.ions)  contains  this  statement: \nHThc  famous  Briggs  v.  Elliott  dictum  adhered  to  by \nthis  court  for  many  years  that  the  Constitution  for \nbids  segregation  but  does  110t  requirc  integration,  is \nnow  dead.\"  Ha·wthorne  v.  Lunenb·ur,q,  Nos.  13,283, \n13,284,  Fourth  Circuit Court of Appeals,  .July 11, 1969. \n\"Freedom  of  choice,\"  as  this  Court  has  already  pointed \nout,  does  110t  legalize  a  scgregated  school  system.  A  plan \nwith  freedom  of  choice  must  be  judged  by  the  same  stan \ndard  as  a  plall  without  freedom  of  choice  whether  or  not \nthe  plan  desegregates  the  public  8chools.

The  test  is  pragmatic,  not  theoretical. \nCONTr;\\,UEV  OPERATION'  OF  SEGREGATED  PUBLIC \nIs \nSCHOOLS  UNLAWFUL \nThe  issue  is  one  of  law  and  order.  Unless  and  until  the \nConst.itution  is  amended  it  is  and  will  be  unlawful to  oper \nate  segregated  public  schools.  Amending  tho  Constitution \ntakes  heavy  majorities  of  voters  or  lawmakers.  I t  is  diffi \neult  to  imngine  any  majority  of  Supreme  Court.,  of  Con \ngress  or  of  popular  vote in  favo,·  of  changing  the  Constitu-\n1i on  to  say  that  hlic  school  pupils  may  law'fully  be  kept \npH \nin  separate  schools  because  they  arc  hlnck.  A  community \nhent  on  \"law  and  order\"  should  expect  its  school  hoard \nmemhers  to  obey  the United  States  Const.itution, and should \nclIcoumlJe  th e'm  in  e ue ry move  1.11  ey  ilia ke  t01Vllrcl  com \nS1tch \npliance.

No  one  in  'Washing-\nMId \n\nOrder  dated  Au.gust \n15,  1969 \nton  or  Raleigii  or  local  government  is  above  or  beyond  the \nConstitution.  None  have  power  to  change  it except by law \nful  means.  None  have  or  claim  the  power  to  interfere  with \nthe  courts  in  cases  like  this  one.  The  malleable  HEW \n\"guidelines\"  put  out  by  the  President's  administrator  for \neducational affairs, and dubious  inferences from  statements \nof  other  officials,  however  highly  placed,  are  irrelevant  to \nthe  constitutional  rights  of  parties  this  case.  Also \nthe  in \nirrelevant  are  soothing  sayings  of  the Vice  President  (who \nhas  the  duty  in  this  area)  to  black-tie  political  audiences, \nand  the  not-so-soothing sayings  of citizens who  erroneously \ntalk  as  if t.he  schoo]  segregation  issue  were  a  simple matter \nof political pressure  and  short-term  public  opinion.  As  for \nthe  Attorney  General of the  United  States, he  bas  just filed \nthe  biggest  desegregation  suit  of  all  against  the  whole \nSta,te  of Georgia.!  Segregation of children in  public schools, \nwhether  they be  black  or  white,  and  regardless  of whether \nthey  do  or  don't  want  to  stay  apart,  is  unlawful.

The most obvious  and constructive element in  the  plan \nis  that  the  School  Board  has  reversed  its  field  and has  ac \ncepted  its  affirmative  constitutional  duty  to  desegregat.e \npupils,  teachers,  principals  and  staff  members  \"at  the \nearliest possible date.\"  I t  has  recognized  that where  people \n\n-- - -\n-\n63a \nOrder  dated  August \n15.0196.9 \nlive  should  not  control  where  they  to  school  nor  the \ngo \nquality  of  their  education,  and  that  transportation  may  he \nnecessary  to  comply  with  the  law.  It  has  recognized  that \ncasy  methods  will  not  do  the  job;  that.  rezoning  of  school \n• \nlines,  perhaps  wholesale;  pairing,  grouping  or  clustering \nof  schools;  lise  of  computer  technology  and  all  available \nmodern  business  methods  can  and  must  be  considered  in \nthe  discharge of the Board's constitut.ional  duty.  This  court \ndoes  not  take  lightly  the  Board's  promises  and  the  Board's \nunder·taking  of  itH  affirmative  dui:y  under  the  Constitution \nand  accepts  these  assurances  at  face  valne.  They  are,  in \nfact,  the  concltlsions  which  necessarily  follow  when  any \ngroup  of  women  and  men  of good  faith  serionsly study  this \nproblem  with  knowledge  of  the  facts  of  this  school  system.. \nand in-light  of the  law  of t.he  land. \n• \n2.  In  the  second  place,  by  the  following  actions  the \nBoard  has  demonstrated  its  aeceptance  of  its  stated  new \npolicies: \na)  The  desegregation  of faculties  and  the  non-racial \nreassignment  of  principals  and  employees  from newly \nclosed  schools.  In  the  formerly  all-black  faculties  the \nBoard  has  dramatically  exceeded  its  goal.  I t   is  as \nsumed  by  the  court  that  this  process  of  faculty  de \nsegregation  will  continue  and  that.  the  goal  for  1970-71 \nwill  be  that faculties  in all schools will  approach a  ratio \nunder  which  all  schools  in  the  system  will  have  ap \nproximately  the  same  proportion  of  black  and  white \nteachers. \n• \nb)  The  closing  of  sevell  schools  and  the  reassign \nment  of  3,000  black  pupils  to  schools  offering  better \neducation. \n\n64a \nOrdet·  dated  A ugu.st \n15,  1969 \nc)  The  J'eu:3sigornent  of  1,245  students  from  several \novercrowded  primarily  black  schools  to  a  number  of \noutlying  predominantly  white  schools. \nd}  The  announced  re-evaluat.ion  of  the  program  of \nlocating  and  building  aIHl  improving  schools,  so  that \neach  project  or  site  will  prod lice  the  \"greatest  degree \nof  desegregation  possible.\" \ne)  The Board  correctly and constructively concluded \nthat  the  so-caUed  \"anti-bnssing  law\"  adopted  by  the \nGeneral  Assembly  of  North  Carolina  on  June 24,  1969, \ndoes  not  inhibit  the  Board  in  carl'ying out  its  constitu \ntional  duties  and  should  not  bamper  the  Board  in  its \nfut.ure  actions.  Leaving  aside  its  dubious  constitu \ntionality  (if  it  reany  did  what  its  title  claims  to  do) \nthe  statute  contains  an  express  exception  which  ren \nders  it  ineffectual  in  that  it  docs  not  prevent  \"any \ntransfer  necessitated  hv  overcrowded  conditions  or \n• \notllet· circwtnsta.nces  which  in.  the  sale  discref.ion  of  the \nSchool  Board  reqll.ire  reassignm.ent.\" \nf)  The  elimillation  without  objection  of  the  former \nprovision  which  had  the  effect  of  inhibiting  transfer \nrights  of black would-be  athletes. \ng)  Quite significantly, the Board calls  upon  the  Plan \nning Board, the Housing Aut.hority,  the Redevelopment \nCommission  and  upon  real  estate  interests,  local  gov \nernment  and  other  interested  part.ies  to  recognize  and \nshare  their  responsibility  for  dealing  with  problems \nof  segregation  in  the  commnnity  at large  as  well  as  in \nthe  school  system. \nh)  The  proposals  for  programs  of  \"compensatory \neducation\" of students, and  for  teacher  orientation  and \n\n- - - - - - - - - - _ . _ - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n_. \n65a \nOrder  daled  August \nl:J,  196.') \nexchnnge  of  activities  among  hlack  and  ,,\"Ilite  gtlldents. \n, \n~ \nThe eOllrt  assumes  thnt  t.hese  somewhat  vaguely  stated \nideas  will  become  implcmented  with  concl'ete  action. \n, \n3.  The Seven ,\"'chool Problem.  The Board plan proposes \nto  close  Second  'Ward  High  School,  Irwin  Avenue  Junior \nHigh  School  and  five  inner-ci I.y  ciemcnta I'Y  schools  (five  of \nwhich  wOl'e  already  marked  fol'  abandonment)  and  to  re \nn ssign  thei I'  students  to  ou tlying  white  schools.  This \n~,OOO \npart  of  the  plan  has  struck  fire  fl\"om  black  community \nleadcrs  and  SOntc  othel\"  critics.

Threats \nof  boycotts  [lnd  strikes  have  been  puhlici7.ed. \nThis  part  of  the  plan  is  distasteful,  because  all  but  200· \nof  the  students  being  reassigned  en  masse  are  black.  It. \ncan  legitimately  be  said  and  has  been  eloquelltly  said  that \nthis  plan  is  an  affront  to  the  dignity  and  pride  of  the \nhlack  citizcns.  Pride  and  digni ty  are  important.  I f  pride \narc \nU11d  dignity  were  all  that  involved,  this  part  of  the \nplan  ought  t.o  be  disapproved.  The  court,  out  of  forty \nyear  memory  of  four  years  of  trallsportation  on  an  un \nheated  school  but  thirteen  miles  each  way  from \n~fodel-T \na  distant  rural  community  to  high  school  in  a  \"city\"  of \n4,000,  is  fully  a \\Va re  how  alien  and  strange  arc  the  sensa \nt.ions  experienced  by  a  school  child  who  is  hauled  out  of \nhis  community  and  into  a  place  where  the  initial \nOW11 \nis \nwelcome  uncertain  cool. \n01' \n•  The  200  st.udents  beillg  fl'om  Paw  Creek  to  Wood \nrens~igned \nland  nre  white. \n\n66a \nOrder  dated  A-ugu.st \n15,  1969 \nHowever,  this  part  of  the  plan  is  not  compulsory. \nStudents  who  want  to  remain  in  the  comfort  of  their \nfamiliar  area may  elect  to  attend  the  Zebulon Vance  School \ninstead;  alternatives  are  also  provided  for  the  junior  high \nschool  students. \nMoreover,  as  one  of  the  attorneys  remarked  at  the  first \nin \nhearing  a  discussiOll  about  reassignments  and  school \nbusses:  \"The  question  is  really  not  one  of  'bussing'  but \nwhether  what  the  child  gets  when  he  gets  off  of the  bus  is \nworth  the  trouble.\" \nI  personally  found  the  better  education  worth  the  bus \ntrip. \nDespite  their  undoubted  importance,  pride  and  dignity \nshould  not  control  over  the  Constitution  and  should  not \noutweigh  the  prospects  for  quality  education  of  children. \nThe  uncontradicted  evidence  before  the  court  is  that \nsegregation  in  Mecklenburg  County  has  produced  its \ninevitable  results  in  the  retarded  educational  achievement \nand  capacity  of  segregated  school  children.  By  way  of \nbrief  illustration  a  table  follows  showing  the  contrasting \nachievements  of  sixth  grade  students  in  five  of  the  closed \n• \nschools  (Bethune,  Fairview,  Isabella  Wyche,  Alexander \nStreet  and  Zeb  Vance)  and  in  five  of  the  schools  to  which \nblack  students  are  going  to  be  transferred: \n\n67a \nOrder  dated  August \n15,  1969 \nAVERAGE  ACHIEVEM1::NT  TEST  SCORES \n1968-69 \nSIXTH  GRADE \nA.eM.

The  experts  and  administrators  all  agreed  that \ntransferring  underprivileged  black  children  from  black \nschools  into  schools  with  70ro  or  more  white  students  pro \nduced  a  dramatic  improvement  in  the  rate  of  progress  and \nan increase in the absolute performance of the less advanced \nstudents,  without  material  detriment  to  the  whites.  There \nwas  no  contrary  evidence.  (In  this  system  71%  of  the \nstudents  arc  white  and  29%  are  black.) \nMoreover,  the.  Board's  announced  policy  and  the  uncon \ntradicted  testimony  of  the  superintendent  show  that \nserious  arrangements  are  being;  made  to  welcome.,  rather \nthan  rebuff,  the  transferees  into  all  school  activities.  This \nis  something  new  and  important. \nNo  legal  authority  is  cited  that  the  Constitution  pro \nhibits  transport  of  conse-nting  black  children  from  an \ninferior  educational  envirorunent  into  a  better  educational \nenvironment  for  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  con \nstitutional  requirement  of  equal  protection  of  laws. \nThe  choice  of  how  to  do  the  job  of  desegregation  is  for \nthe  School  Board  ·not  for  the  court. \nThe  Board  has  wide  discretion  in  choosing  methods; \nmany  effective  methods  are  described  in  the  evidence;  the \ncourt's duty is simply to  pass  on the  legality of the  Board's \nactions.  I t  appears  to  the  court  that  the  improvement  in \nthe  education  of  4,200  school  children  is  the  one  most \nobvious  result  of  the  Board's  plan  of  action  for  1969-70, \nand  that this  is  more  important constitutionally  than  other \nconsiderations  which  have  been  advanced. \nI t  is  not  the  intention  of  this  court  to  endorse  or  ap \nprove  any future  plan which  puts  the  burden of  desegrega \ntion  primarily  upon  one  race.  However,  there  is  not  time \nbefore  September  2,  1969  to  do  a  complete  job  of  reassign-\n\n69a \nOrde·r  dated  A ugttst \n15,  1969 \ning  pupils;  the  plan  is  a  step  toward  more  complete \ncompliance  with  the  law;  the  court  reluctantly  votes  in \nfavor  of  the  4,200  school  childre.n  anu  approves  the  plan: \n• \non  a  011e-year  basis. \n• \nTHE  l\\fAJOR  TASK  LIES  AHEAD  THIS  FAIJ. \nThe  big  job  remains  to  be  dOlle.  After  implementation \nof  the  current  plan,  further  large  scale  faculty  transfers \nwill still be  necessary.  Sixteen  years  after Brown v.  Board \nof Education,  some  thirteen  thousand  school  children  will \nremain  in  black  or  nearly  all-black  schools.  Most  white \nstudents  will  remain  in  substantially  all-white  schools. \nThe  failure  of  the  plan  to  deal  with  those  problems  of \ncourse  can  not  be  approved.  'rhe  failure  of  the  plan  to \ninclude  a  time  table  for  the  performance  of  specific  ele \nments  of  the  program  of  course  ca.n  not  be  approved, \nFelder,  et at.  v.  Harnett  Cou.nty  Boanl  of Education,  et  al., \n409  F.  2d  1070  (4th  Cir.,  1968).  These  matters  must  be \ncovered  by  specific  instructions  to  the  Board. \nAll  findings  of  fact  in  the  previous  orders  of  April  23, \n1969,  and  June  20,  1969,  and  the  supplemental  findings \nof  June  24,  1969,  are  incorporated  herein  to  the  ext.ent \nthat  t.hey  are  consistent  with  the  findings,  conclusions  and \norders  herein  reached  and  given.

The  faculty  desegregation  program  is  approved. \n• \n3.  The  plan  to  desegregate  pupils  by  closing  seven  all \nblack  schools  and  assigning  their  pupils  to  outlying  white \n\n70a \nOrder  dated  August \nlS,  196.9 \nschools  is  approved  only  (1)  with  great  reluctance,  (2)  as \na  one-year,  temporary  arrangement,  and  (3)  with  the \ndistinct  reservation  that  \"one-way  bussing\"  plans  for  the \nyears  after 1969-70  will  not be  acceptable.  If,  as  the  school \nsuperintendent  testified,  none  of  the  modern,  facu1ty \nintegrated,  expensive,  \"equal\"  black  schools  in  the  system \nare  suitable  for  desegregation  steps  can  and  should \nDOW, \nhe  taken  to  change  that  condition  before  the  fall  of  1970. \nUnsuitability  or  inadequacy  of  a  1970  \"black\"  school  to \neducate  1970  white  pupils  will  not  be  considered  by  the \ncourt  in  passing  upon  plans  for  1970  desegregation.  The \ndefendants  contended  and  the  court  found  ill  its  April  23, \n1969  order  that facilities  and  teachers  in the  various  black \nschools  were  not  measurably  inferior  to  those  in  the \nvarious  white  schools.  It  is  too  late  now  to  expect  the \ncourt  to  proceed  upon  an  opposite  assumption. \n4.  The  plan  to  reassign  1,245  students  from  presently \novercrowded  black  schools  is  approved. \n5.  Reassignment  of  the  Paw  Creek  students  to  Wood \nland  is  approved. \n6.  The  proposals  of  the  Board  for  restructure  of  atten \ndance  lines;  for  consideration  of  pairing  and  grouping \nschools;  for  review  of  the  construction  programs;  and  for \nsupport  programs,  student  exchange  and  faculty  orienta \ntion are  approved  in  principle,  although  for  lack  of specific \ndetail  and  time  table  they  are  not  approved  as  presented. \n7.  The  Board  is  directed  to  prepare  and  present  by \nNovember  17,  1969,  the  following: \n(1)  Plan  for  complete  faculty  desegregation  for \n1970-71. \n\n- - -\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n----~--. \n71[1. \nOrder  dated  August \n15, 1969 \n(2)  Plan  for  student  dese 'Tcgation  for  1970-71,  in \n6\ncluding  making  full  use  of  zoning,  pairing,  grouping, \nclustering,  transportation  and  other  techniques,  com \nplete  with  statistics  and  maps  and  other  data  showing \nprecisely  what  (subject  to  later  movement  of  pupils) \nthc  assignment  of  pupils  and  teachers  will  be  for  the \nyear  1970-71,  having  in  mind  as  its  goal  for  1970-71 \nthe  complete  desegregati011  of the  enti re  system  to  the \nmaximum  extent  possible.  (The  assumption  in  the \nBoard's  report  that  a  school  is  desegregated  when  i t  \nhas  as  many  as  10%  of  a  minority  race  in  its  student \nbody  is  not  accepted  by  the  court,  and  neither  the \nBoard nor the court should be  guided  by  such  a  figure.) \n\"Possible\"  as  used  here  refers  to  educational  not \n1f \n\"political\"  possibility.  Anson  County,  two-thirds \nblack,  can  totally  desegregate  its  schools  in  1969,  as \nthey  have  now  done,  Mecklenburg'  County  should  be \nwil1 \nable  to muster  the  political  to  follow  sui t. \n(3)  A  detailed  report  showing,  complete  with \nfigures  and  maps,  the  location  and  nature  of  each \nconstruction  project  proposed  or  under  way,  and  the \neffect  this  project may  reasonably  be  expected  to  have \nupon  thc  program  of  desegregating  the  schools . \n• \n8.

      "text": "46a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  June  20,  1969 \nPursuant  to  notice  dated  .Tune  4,  1969,  a  hearing  was \nheld  in  Charlotte  on  June  16,  17  and  18,  1969,  on  various \nmatters  including  (1)  the  motion  of  the  individual  defend \nants  for  dismissal;  (2)  the  motion  of  the  plaintiffs  for \ncontempt  citations  against  the  individual  defendants;  (3) \nthe  proposals  offered  hy  the  defendants  pursuant  to  the \nApril  23,  1969  order  as  a  plan  for  desegregating  the  Char \nlotte-Mecklenburg  schools;  and  (4)  the  motion  of the  plain \ntiffs  for  an  order  restraining  further  school  construction \nuntil  the  segl'egation  i!:;sne  has  been  satisfactorily  resolved. \nI. \nTHE MOTION  OF  THE  SCHOOL  BOARD  MEMBERS  TO \nThe  Illotion  of  the  individual  defendants,  members  of the \nschool  board,  to  dismiss  was  and  is  denied.  This  is  a  suit \nunder  the  Civil  Rights  Act  involving  questions  of  equal \nprotection  of  laws  and  racial  discrimination  and  segre \ngation  in  the  public  schools.  The  individual  defendants  are \nproper  parties  and  their  presence  is  appropriate  and \ndesirable. \nn. \nTHE MOTION  FOR A  CONTEMPT CITATIO}l. \nThe  motion  of  the  plaintiffs  that  the  individual  defend \nants  be  found  in  contempt  of  the  court  is  on  this  record \ndenied.  The  board  is  badly  divided  and  many  of  its  recent \ndecisions appear to be made by a  five  to four vote.  Supreme \nCourt  judges  now  and  then  make  five  to  four  decisions. \n(Fortunately  their  votes  in  all  major  school  segregation \ncases  appear  to  have  been  unanimous.)  The  members  of \n\n47a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  20,  1969 \nJ~I.ne \nthe  board  have  had  uncomplimentary  things  to  say  about \neach  other and about the cOllrt,  and  many of them  obviously \ntlisagree  with  t.he  legality  and  propriety  of  the  order  of \nthe  court;  but  these  latter  sentiments  Illay  be  regarded  by \nthe  court  as  evidence  of  disagreement  witb  rathel'  than \ncontempt fol'  the court  who  is  himself  not far  removed  from \nactive  participation  in  the  time-honored  custom  of criticiz \ning  a  jndge  who  bas  I'Uled  against  him.  Moreover,  on  an \nissue  of  such  significance,  the  amount  of  foot-dragging \nwhich  has  taken  place,  up  to  at  least,  should  not  he \nlIOW \nconsidered  as contempt of court.. \nIII. \nTHE  PLAN'  OF  THE  DEFENDANTS. \n1.  The  history  of  the  pll/n . .. ·The  order  of  this  court  di \nrecting  a  further  plan  for  desegrcgation  was  entered  April \n23,  Hi69.  'Vithin  hours,  various  of  the  defendants  ex \npressed  sharp  views  pro  nnd  con.  The  board  met  on  April \n28,  1969,  and  for  the  fir.st  time  bl'ietly  diseussed  t.he  order. \nBy  a  five  to  fo1ll'  margin,  apparently,  they  decided  in \nformally  not  to  try  to  appeal  immecliately,  upon  the  basis \nthat  the  right  of  appeal  from  the  order  to  prepare  a  plan \nwas  doubtful.  The  school. superintendent was  instructed  to \nNo \nprepare  a  desegregation  plan.  express  guide1ines  were \ngiven  the  superintendent.  However,  the  views  of  many \nmembers  expressed  at  the  meeting  wNe so  opposed  to  seri \nous  and  suhstantial  desegregation  that  everyone  including \nthe  superintendent could  reasonably  have concluded,  as  the \ncourt does,  that  a  \"minimal\"  p]au  was  what  was  called  for, \nand  that  the  \"plan\"  was  essentiaUy  a  prelude  to  antici \npated  disapproval  and  appeal.  In  a  cOllnty  and  city  criss-\n\n48a \nOpinion  an(l  Order  dated  J·nnc. \n20,1969 \ncrossed  by  school  hn:;  routes  for  23,000  pupils,  more  than \ntwenty  thousand  citizens,  mostly  from  affluent  suburbia, \nmany of  whose  children  undoubtedly  go  to  school  school \n011 \nbusses,  signed  pctitio11S  against  \"involuntary\"  bussing  of \nstudents.  The  fl'cnzy  of  parents  received  a  ready  formYl \nin  televised  meetings  of  the  board.  The  staff  were  never \ndirected  to  do  I'erious  work  on  re-drawiIlg  of  school \nfilly \nzone  lines,  puiring  of  schools,  combining  zones,  grouping \nof  schools,  confere11ces  with  the  Depal'tmcllt  of  Health, \nEducation  and  \\Velfme,  nor  any  of  the  other  possihle \nmetllOds  of mah.-ing  real progress towards  desegregation. \nThe  superintendent  revealed  tbe  general  tenllS  of  his \nplan  within  a  few  <.]::IYs  and  later  presented  it  formally  on \n\"May  S,  1969.  It  provided  for  full  faculty  desegregation  in \n1969,  which  the  superi.ntendent  said  he  considered  feasible. \nIt  provided  moderate  changes  in  the  pupil  assignment \nplans;  anu  it  contemplated  future  study  of  the  other \nmethods  (If  desegregation  suggested  in  the  April  23,  1969 \nordeI'. \nThe  board  then  met,  struck  out  virtnally  all  the  effective \nprovisions of  the  plan,  and  asked  for more \n~mperintelldent's \ntime  from  the  court,  which  had  previously  been  promised. \nThe  boarel's  committee  on  buildings  and  sites,  newly  re \nconstituted, met and voted  to  cancel  the long standing  plans \nfor  Metropolitan  High  School,  and  voted  to  build  it  as  only \na  specialty and  vocational school  without including the com \nprehensive  high  school  which  consultants  and  experts,  in \ncluding  the  school  board's  staff  and  superintendent,  had \nrecommended  and  still recommend.  No new  facts  except the \norder  of  court  had  developed  to  account  for  the  sudden \ncbange of plan.  The stated reason for  the change was that a \ngeneral  high  school  in  Second  Ward  (though  not  a  voca \ntional  or  technical  school)  would  necessarily  be  black  and \n\n49a. \nOpinion  and  Order  dated \n.hule  20 ..  1969 \ntherefore  should  not  be  built.  [The  Second  ·Ward  school \nsite, where Metropolitan is  scheduled  to be  built,  is  squarely \nin  the  center  of  the  city's  population;  is  a  scant four  blocks \nzone; \nfrom  the  south  boundary  of  its  and  is  apparently the \neasiest  high  school  in  tOW11  to  desegregate;  its  boundaries \ncould  easily be  re-drawn  by extending its southern boundary \n(Morehead  Street)  and  its  eastel'll  boundary  (Queens \nHond)  a  few  blocks.] \nThereaftor,  .May  28,  1969,  the  plan  was  filed.  Volun \n011 \nteers  were  requested  alJlong  tun  teachers;  pupil  t.ransfer \nrequest.s  were  set  ont;  data  on  the  workings  of  the \n111ld \nplan  began  to  accumulate. \nDurillg  the  early  dehate  over  the  COllrt  order,  events \ntranspi)'ed  between  tbe  chairman  and  the  superil1tendent \nwhieh  were  thollght  by  an  assist.ant  superintendent  and \nothers  to  threaten  the  snperintendent's  job  if  he  pus bed \nfo),  compliance  with  the  court's  order.  A  few  days  before \nhearing,  the  board  committee  plll\"SOl1nol  declined \nthi~  011 \nto  accopt  tbe  stlperilltendent's  recommendation  that  Robert \nDavis, a  Negro,  be appointed  principal of one of the schools. \nThis  was  t.he  f1J'st  time  such  n  recommendation  had  not \nbeen  acceptcd.  Aftel'  some  debate,  the  decision  was  post \nponed,  with  the  superintendent  requested  to  bring  in  al \nternat.e  names.  The  publicly stated  reasons  for  not.  approv \ning  the  appointment  were  that  Davis,  whose  training,  ex \nperience  and  qualifications  were  unqnestioned,  is  a  plllintiff \nin  this case and  a  member of the  Negro  Classroom  Teachers \nAssociation  and  has  spoken  out.  publicly  ill  favor  of compli \nance  wth  this  court's  order  ·including  one  television  ap \npearance  before  the  board  itself  to  which  the  board  had \ninvited  interested  citizens.  Davis,  according  to  tbe  press, \nwas  eventually  confirmed  fo)\"  the  job  on  June  19,  1969, \n. \n. \nbut  onl \\'  after  a  \"Ioyaltv  oa.th\"  had  heen  exacted.

The  June  hearing.  -The  defendants,  under \n16,  1969 \nthe  law,  had  the  burden  of  showing  that  their  plan  would \ndesegregate  the  se-hools.  To  carry  that  hurden  they  intro \nduced  a  short  written  brief  and  some  statistical  data  and \nrested  their  case  without  live  testimony.  The  plaintiffs \ncalled  all  members  of  the  school  board  and  the  Rhode \nIsland  expert,  Dr.  Finger,  who  testified  at  the  March  hear \ning,  and  a  few  other  witnesses.  There  was  some  rebuttal \nfrom  the  board. \n3.  Findings  a.s  to  General  Board  Policy.  -\na)  The  board  does  not  admit  nor  claim  that  it  has \nany  positive  duty  to  promote  desegregation. \nb)  School  sites  and  school  improvements  have  not \nbeen  selected  nor  planned  to  promote  desegregation \nand  the  board  admits  no  such  duty. \nc)  Board  policy  is  that  the  Constitution  is  satisfied \nwhen  they  locate  schools  where  children  are  and  pro \nvide  \"freedom  of  transfer\"  for  those  who  want  to \nchange  schools. \nd)  Despite  inclusion  in  the  \"Plan,\"  the  decision \nit~ \nof  the  board  about  Metropolitan  High  School  is  not \nreally  a  final  one;  several  members  consider  the  issue \nin  doubt,  and  the  full  board  has  not  formally  con \nit. \nsidered \n\n51a \nOpinioll  aml  Order  dated  J'lIne  20,  1969 \n4.  The  Pllpi,l  Assig1ln'lent  Plan.  The  plan  now  proposed \nis  the  plan  previously  found  racially  discriminatory,  with \nthe  addition  of  olle  element  the  provision  of  transporta \ntion  for  children  electing  to  transfer  out  of  ScllOOls  where \ntheir  I'aces  are  in  a  majority  to  schools  where  they  will  be \nin  a minority.  Such p\"ovision  01'  transport.ation  is  approved. \nAnother  provision  of the  plan  makes  high  school  athletes \nwho  transfer  from  one  school  to  another  ineligible  for \nvarsity  or  junior  varsity  athletics  until  they  have  been  a \nyear  in  the  new  school.  For  the  current  year,  with  the  re \nturns  almost  complete,  only  two  white  students  out  of \nsome  59,000  have  elected  to  transfer  from  white  schools \nto  black  schools.  SOl11e  330  hlack  students  out  of  some \n24,000  have  elect.ed  to  transfer  to  white  schools.  Only \nthe  tiniest handful  of  wbite  students  have  ever  in  any  year \n.  asked  to  transfer to  black schools.  effect of  the  athletic \n~rhe \npenaHy  is  obvious  it  discriminates  against  black  students \nwho  may want to  transfer and  take  part in  sports,  and is  no \npenalty  on  white  students  who  show  no  desire  for  such \ntransfers.  The  defendants'  superintendent  considers  ath \nletics  an  important  feature  of  education.  This  penalty \nprovision  is  racially  discriminatory.  The  board  is  directed \nTlOt  to  enforce  it  any  more  and  to  give  adequate  individual \nnotice  to  all  rising  10th,  11th  and  12th  grade  students  that \nthey  may  I'econsider  their  previous  choice  of  schools  in \n• \nlight  of  the  removal  of  the  penalty. \nFreedom  of  transfer  increases  rather  than  decreases \nsegregation.  The  school  superintendent  testified  that \nthere  would  be,  net,  more  than  1,200  additional  white  stu \ndents  going  to  predominantly  black  schools  if  freedom  of \ntransfer  were  abolished.  The  use  of  a  free  transfer  provi \nsion  is  a  decision  for  the  board; it may  make  desegregation \nmore  palatable to  the community  at  large;  it  is  not,  per  se, \n• \n\n52a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated  Jmle \n20,  1969 \nif  the  schools  are  desegregated,  unconstitutional.  N evcr \ntheless,  desegregation  of  schuols  is  somethi.ng  tha.t  has  to \nbe  occomplishediudcpendent  of  freedom  of  tratl.sfe r .  This \nis  a  fact  which  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  statistics \nhas  only  become  clear  to  t11e  court.  since  the  previous  order \nwas  issued. \n5.  The  Faculty  Assignment  Plat!.  The  plan  originally \nproposed  by  the  superintendent  would  have  desegregated \nthe  faculty  as  a  routine  matter  in  19('i9.  The  plan  proposed \nby  the  board  however  is  not  materially  different  from  the \nalready  c.xisting  plan.  It  continues  to  rely  upon  voluntary \ntransfers  and  it  contemplates  affirmat.ive  assignment  of \nteachers  to  black  schools  only  late  in  the  day  after  a  hope \nful  routine  of filling  vacancies  (some of which  do  not  exist) \nhas  been  followed.  The  board  has  not  taken  a  position  of \nleadership  with  the  teachers  and  the  results  are  apparent. \nOnly  28  out  of  2,·700  white  teachers,  and  only  38  out.  of 900 \nblack  teachers,  had  on  June 18,  1969  indicated  a  willingness \nto  transfer  to  schools  of  the  opposite  race.  Testimony  of \nthe  board  members  who  comprise  the  majority  of the  board \nsnggests  that  they  do  not  really  contemplate  substantial \nfaculty  desegregation  and  that  they  may  consider  figures \nof  \"10ro\";  or  one  black  teacher  to  each  white  school  and \none  white  teacher  to  each  black  school;  or  filling  vacancies \nf!'Om  the  opposite  race  as t.hey  arise,  to  be  compliance  with \nthe  needs  of  the  situation.  None  of  these  ideas,  of  course, \namonnts  to  desegregation  of the faculty.  The  evidence  sub \nmitted  by  the  board  does  not  demonstrate  that  the  fae-nIty \nplan  will  work.  Several  board  members  said  that  the  plan \nto  assign  teachers  is  not  an  \"idle promise.\" \nAll  that  it  takes  to  make  the  faculty  plan  work  is  timely \ndeeision by the board to  implement the  assignment of teach-\n\n--\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n53a \nOpi'i'lion  and  Order  dated  .!1/.ne \n20,  1969 \ners.  Board  membel's  are  requested  in  this  connection  to \nconsiclel'  the  latest  ullanimons  Supreme  Court  decision, \nUnited  States  Montgomery  County  Board  of  Education \nv. \n(October  Term  HJGS) ,  Case  No,  7!)S,  decided  June  2,  1969, \nreversing the  Fifth Circuit  Couri  of Appeals  and  upholding \ndish'iet  cOllrt  oeder  for  faculty  desegregation  undel'  a \n11 \nmathematical formula. Ruling- on  the factulty plall will there \nfore  be  deferred  ulltil  after  Aug-ust  4,  1969,  by  which  time \nthe  hoard  is  directed  to  file  a  report.  stating  in  detail  what. \nthe  plan  has  clOlle  and  what  the  status  of  faculty  assign \nments  thml  is.  The  court.  considers  the  faculty  assignment \nplan  to  be  il1lpoJ'tant and  agrees  with  t.he  snperintendent  of \nschools  t ha t  immediate  clesegl'llga tion  of  the  faculty  is \nfeasible.  This  is  a  substantial  inlpl'O\\'emellt  which  is  avail \nable  without  arousing  ghosts  of  \"bussing,\"  \"lIeighborhood \nschools,\" Or  additional  expense. \nIV. \nGERRYIII ANDEr:I1\\\"G \nThis  issue  was  passed  over  in  the  previons  opinion  upon \nthe  belief  which  tlw  court  st.ill  entertaills  that  the  defend \nants,  as  part.  of  overall  desegregation  plan,  will  elim \na  3n \ninate  correct  all  school  zones  which  were  created  or \n01\" \nexist  to  ellclose  black  or  white  groups  of  pupils  or  whose \npopulation  is  contl'olled  for  purposes  of  segregatioll.  How \never,  it  may  be  timely  to  observe  and  the  conrt  finds  a \nliS \nfact  that  no  zones  have  apparelltly  been  created  main \n01' \ntained  for  the  pm'pose  of  prollloting  desegregation  that \nj \nthe  whole  plan  of  \"building  schools  where  the  pupils  are\" \nwithout  fnrthcJ'  control  Pl'oIllOtes  segregation;  and  that. \ncertain  schools,  fo!'  example  Billingsville,  Second  -Ward, \nAvenue  and  Amuy  .James,  obviously  serve  school \nBl'llllS \n\n54a \nOpinion  and  Order  dated \n.J1Jne  20,  1969 \nzones  which  were  either  created  or  which  have  been  con \ntrolled so  as  to  surround  pockets  of hlack  students  and  that \nthe  result.  of  these  actions  is  discriminatory.  These  aro \n• \nnot  named  as  an  exclusive  list  of  such  situations,  but  as \nillustrations  of  a  long  standing  policy  of  control  over  the \nmakeup  of  school  population  which  scarcely  fits  true \nany \n\"neighborhood  school\"  philosophy. \no \nThe  findings  of  fact  ill  the  April  23,  1969  order  and \nall  statements  in  this  opinion  are  treated  as  findings  of \nfact  in  support of the  order.  All  of  the  evidence  in  the  case \nis  considered  in  support  of  the  order. \nORDER \nBased upon  the  evidence and upon  the  foregoing  findings \nof  fact  the  orders  of  the  court  are  as  follows: \n1.  The  motion  of  the  individual  defendants  to  dismiss \nis  denied. \n2.  No  citations for  contempt are ma.de. \n3.  Decision  on  the  faculty  assignment  plan  is  deferred \npending  receipt  of a  progress  report  from  the  board  or \n011 \nbefore  August  4,  1969. \n4.  The  one  year  penalty  on  transferring  high  school \nathletes  is  disapproved  with  direction  as  above  for  appro \npriate  personal  communication  to  rising  high  school \nstudents. \n5.  The  provision  of  transport.ation  for  students  trans \nferring from a  majority to  a  minority situation  is  approved. \n\n55a \nOllin,ion  Order  dat.ed  J 1J..ne \n20, \n(l.tl,d  1969 \n6.  The  board  is  directed  to  proceed  no  further  with \naction  on  IV[etropolitan  High  School  pending  n  showing  by \nthe  board  that  the  school  if  constructed will  be  adequately \ndesegregated  a  finding  by  the  court  t.o  that  effect. \nHnd \nThis  is  based  upon  the  prcvious  fiudings  that  the  board's \ndecision  on  Metropolitall  was  unduly  affected  by  racial \nconsiderations  and  that  the  board  has  not  accepted  its \naffirmative  legal  duty  to  build  school  facilities  so  as  to \npl'omote  desegregation. \n7.  As  to  the  other  building  pl'Ojects  referrcd  to  in  the \nmotion  for  restraint  on  construction,  the  hurden  remains \nupon  the  defendants  to  show  thut.  these  programs  will \nproduce  desegregation.  The  written  material  t.endered  by \nthe  defendants  this  subjeet  is  lengthy,  and  does  not \n011 \nappeal'  to  sustain  that  burden.  However,  decision  on  the \nrequest  for  injunctioll  against  projects  other  than  Metro \npolitan  will  be  delayed  pending  further  study  of  the  evi \ndence. \n8.  I t  is  further  ordered  that  the  defendants  proceed  to \nprepare  and  submit  by  August  4-,  1969,  a  positive  plan  for \ndesegregation  of  the  pupils  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nsystem,  as  originally  directed  on  April  23,  1969. \n~chool \nA  witness,  Dr.  Finger,  described  in  detail  a  plan  for  de \nsegregation  by  changing  certain  school  zone  lines  and \nmerging  certain  schools  into  districts  and  using  certain \nschools  as  feeders  for  others.  This  plan  shows  a  high \nit \ndegree  of  realism  in  that  minimizes  the  necessit.y  for \nlong-range  transportation  and  takes  substantial  advantage \nof  location  and  makeup  of  popUlations.  Local  school  ad \nministration consider such a  plan  feasible.

      "text": "1.1.3a \nOrder  daled  February  5,  1970 \nOn  December  2,  1969,  this  court  appointed  Dr.  John  A. \nFinger,  Jr.,  of  Providence,  Rhode  Isand,  to  study  the \nCharlotte-1Iecklenburg  school  system  and  advise  the  court \nhow  tho  schools  could  be  desegregated.  The  defendant \nschool  board,  by  order  of\"  December  1,  1969,  had  been  ex \nt,ended  a  fourth opportunity to submit a  plan if they wished. \nDr.  Finger ·went  to  work;  the school  staff  worked  with him; \nand they have produced  extremely useful  information \nRamo \nand  reports,  which  will  he  referred  to  in  this  order  as  the \nBoard  plan  and  the  Finger  plan. \nHearings  on  tho  plans  were  conducted  on  February  2 \nand  February 5,  1970. \nThe  Board  plan,  prepared  by  the  school  staff,  relies \nalmost  entirely  on  geographic  attendance  zones,  and  is \ntailored  to  the  Board's  limiting  specincatiom;.  I t   leaves \nmany  schools  segregated.  The  Finger  plan  incorporates \nmost  of  those  parts  of  the  BOHl\"(l  plan  which  achieve  de \nsegregation  in  particular  districts  hy  re-zoning;  however, \nthe  Finger  plan  goes  further  and  produces  desegregation \nof all  the  schools  in  the  system. \nTaken  together,  the  plans  provide  adequate  supplements \nto  a  final  desegregation  order. \nThe  court  would  like  again  to  express  appl'eciatioll  to \nDr.  Finger  for  the  intelligence,  resourcefulness  and  tact \nwith  which  he  has  pursued  his  difficult  assignment,  lind  to \nDr.  Willinm  Self,  Superintendent  of  the  schools,  and  to \nhis  able  staff,  for  the  excellent  work  done  by  them  in  their \ndifficult  role  of  helping  prepare  one  plan  to  comply  with \nwhat the COllrt.  believes  the law requires, and simultaneously \npreparing  another  plan  to  suit  the  majority  of  t.he  School \nBoard  who,  at last reckoning,  still  did  not  appear  to  accept \nthe  court's  order  as  representing  the  law  of  the  land. \n\n114a \nOrder  dated  February \n5,  1970 \nThe  court  is  also  grateful  to  the  Board's  outside  con \nsultant,  Mr.  Weil,  of  Systems  Associates,  Inc.,  whose  two \nhundred  days  of  work  and  whose  computer  studies  fonned \nthe  building  blocks,  or  points  of  departure,  for  much  of \nthe work  of the  others. \nRecent  appellate  court  decisions  have  hammered  home \nthe  message  that  sixteen  years  of  \"deliberate  speed\"  are \nlong  enough  to  desegregate  tax  supported  schools.  On \nOctober  29,  1969,  in  Alexander v.  Holmes  369  U.S. \nC01l1~ty, \n19,  the  Supreme  Court  ordered  numerous  Deep  South \nschool  districts  to  be  completely  desegregated  by  January \n1,  1970;  schools  in  Atlanta,  Miami  and  parts  of  Chicago \nhave been  ordered  totally desegregated  the Supreme  Court \ni \nin  January  ordered  February  1,  1970,  desegregation  of \n300,000  pupils  in  six  Gulf  Coast  states  the  Fourth  Circuit \ni \nCourt  of  Appeals  in  Nesbit  v.  Statesville,  F.2d.  -  \n(December 2,1969), ordered elimination by January 1,  1970, \nof  the  racial  characteristics  of  the  last  black  schools  in \nDurham,  Reidsville  and  Statesville,  North  Carolina;  and \nin  Whittenberg  v.  Greenville,  South  Carolina,  the  Fourth \nCircuit  Court  of  Appeals,  in  an  opinion  by  Chief  Judge \nClement  F.  Haynsworth,  Jr.,  has  just  last  month  ordered \nthe  desegregation  by  February  16,  1970,  of  the  58,000  stu \ndents  in  Judge  Haynsworth's  own  home  town.  Judge \nRobert  Martin  of  Greenville,  pursuant  to  that  mandate,  on  • \nFebruary  2,  1970,  ordered  all  the  Greenville  schools  to  be \npopulated  by  February  16,  1970,  on  a  basis  of  800/0  white \nand  20ro  black. \nIn the  Gree\"nville  opinion  the  court  said: \nHThese  decisions  leave  us  with  no  discretion  to  con \nsider delays  in pupil  integration  until  September 1970. \nWhatever  the  state  of  progress  in  a  particular  school \n\n115a \nOrder  da.ted  February \n5, 1970 \ndistrict and whatever the  disruption which  will  be  occa \nsioned  by  the  immediate  reassignment  of  teachers  and \npupils  in  mid-year,  there  remains  no  judicial  discretion \nto  postpone  immediate  implementation  of  the  consti \ntutional  principles  as  announced  in  Green  v.  County \nSchool  Board  of  N ew  Kent  County,  391  U.S.  430; \nAlexander v.  Holmes  County  Bd.  of Educ.;  396  U.S.  19 \n(Oct. 29,  1969) ; Carter  West  Feliciana  Parish School \nv. \nBd.,  ..  U.S.  (Jan.  14,  1970).\" \nThese decisions  are binding on  the  United  States  District \nCourt  for  the  'Westem  District  of  North  Carolina.  Unless \nthat  were  true,  t.he  Constitution  would  mean  whatever \nmight be  the  temp01'8 ry notion  of  whichever  one  of  340-odd \nfederal  judges happened  to  hear  the  case.  This  is  a  matter \nof  law,  not  anarchy;  of  constitutional  right,  not  popular \nsentiment. \nThe  order  whieh  follows  is  not  based  upon  any  require \nment  of  \"racial  balance.\"  The  School  Board,  after  four \nopportunities  and  nearly  ten  months  of  time,  have  failed \nto  submit  a  lawful  plan  (one  which  desegregates  all  the \nschools),  This  default  on  their  part  leaves  the  court  in \nthe  position  of being  forced  to  prepare  or  choose  a  lawful \nplan.  The  fairest  way  the  court  knows  to  deal  with  this \nsituation  was  stated  clearly  in  the  December  1,  1969  order, \nas follows: \n\"In  default  of  any  such  plan  from  the  school  board, \n.the  court  will  start  with  the  thought,  originally  ad \nvanced  in  the  order  of  April  23,  that  efforts  should  be \nmade  to  reach  a  71-29  ratio  in  the  various  schools  so \nthat  there  will  be  no  hasis  for  contending  that  one \nschool  is  racially  different  from  the  others,  but  to \n\n116a \nOrder  dated  February \n5,  1970 \nunderstand  that  variations  from  that  norm  may  be \nunavoidable.\" \nand  in  accordance  with  the  specific,  detailed, \nTHEREFORE, \nJ1Umbered  guidelines  of  this  court's  order  of  December  1, \n1969,  IT  Is \nORDERED: \n1.  That  the  defendnnts  discontinue  the  operation  of \nsegregated  schools. \n2.  That  the  defendants  take  such  action  as  is  necessary \nto  desegregate  all  the  schools  students  and  faculty. \n3.  That  desegregation  of  faculty  he  accomplished,  as \npreviously ordered, by assigning faculty  (specialized faculty \npositions  excepted)  so  that  the  ratio  of  black  and  white \nfaculty  members  of  each  school  shall  be  appr'oximately  the \nsame  as  the  ratio  of  black  and  white  faculty  members \nthroughout  the  system. \n4.  That teachers  be  assigned  so  that the  competence  and \nexperience  of teachers  in  formerly  or recently black schools \nwill  not  be  inferior  to  those  in  the  formerly  or  recently \nwhite  schools  in  the  system. \n5.  That  no  school  he  operated  with  an  all-black  or  prc \ndominantly  black  student  body. \n6.  That  pupils  of  all  grades  he  assigned  in  sllch  a  way \nthat as  nearly as  practicable  the  various  schools  at various \ngrade  levels  have  about  the  same  proportioll  of  black  and \nwhite  students. \n7.  That  transportation  he  offered  on  a  uniform  non \nracial  basis  to  all  children  whose  attendance  in  any  school \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n.  -\n• \n1l7a \nOrder  dated  Fcb-ruary \n5,  1.970 \nis  necessary  to  bring  about  the  reduction  of  segregation, \nand  who  live  farther  from  the  school  to  which  they  are \nassigned  than  the  Board determines  to  he  walking dist.ance. \nEstimates  of  the  number  of  children  who  may  have  to  he \ntransported  have  run  as  high  as  10,000  or more.  Since  tho \ncost  to  the  local  system  is  about  or  a  year  per \n$18  $20 \npupil,  lind  the  cost  to  the  state  in  those  areas  where  the \nstate  provides  transportation  funds  is  about  another  $18 \nor $20 a  year per pupil,  the  average  cost for  transportation \nis  apPHl'cntly  less  per  pupil  per  year.  The  local \nthan  $40 \nI t  \nschool  budget  is  about $45,000,000  a  year.  would  appear \nthat  transporting  10,000  additional  children,  if  tlw.t  is \nnecessary,  and  if  the  defendants  had  to  pay  it  all,  would \nadd  less  tuan  one  pel'  cent to  the  local  cost  of  operating the \nschools.  The  significant  point,  however,  is  that  the  cost  is \nnot  a  valid  legal  reason  for  continued  denial  of  constitu \ntional rights. \nThat  are  used \n8.  if  geogmphic  zones  in  making  school \nassignments,  the  parts  of  a  zone  need  not  be  contiguous, \n9.  That  the  defendants  a  continuing  control \nmaintRin \nover  the  race  of  children  in  each  school,  just  as  was  done \nfor  many  decades  before  B-rown  v.  of  Educatio'lI, \nBO(lnl \nand  maintain  the  racial  make-up  of  each  school  (including \nany  new  and  any  re-opened  schools)  to  prevent  any  school \nfrom  becoming  racially  identifiable. \n10.  That  \"freedom  of  choice\"  or  \"freedom  of  transfer\" \nmay  not be  allowed  by  the  Board  if  the  effect  of  any  given \ntransfer  or  group  of  transfers  is  to  increase  the  degree  of \nsegregation  in  the  school  from  which  the  transfer  is  re \nquested  or in  the  school  to  which  the  tmllsfer  is  desired. \n\nU8a \nOrder  dated  February \n5, 1970 \n11.  That  the  Board  retain  its  statutory  power  and  duty \nto  make  assignments  of  pupils  for  administrative  reasons, \nwith  or  without  requests  from  parents.  Administrative \ntransfers  shall  not  be  made  if  the  result  of  such  transfers \nis to  restore or increase  the degree  of segregation  in either \nthe  transferor  or  the  transferee  school. \n12.  That  if  transfers  are  sought  on  grounds  of  \"hard \nship,\"  race  will  not  be  a  valid  basis  upon  which  to  demon \nstrate  \"hardship.\" \n13.  That  the  Board  adopt  and  implement  a  continuing \nprogram,  computerized  or  otherwise,  of  assigning  pupils \nand  teachers  during  the  school  year  as  well  as  at the  start \nof each year for  the  conscious  purpose of maintaining each \nschool  and  each  faculty  in  a  condition  of  desegregation. \n14.  That  the  defendants  report  to  the  court  weekly  be \ntween  now  and  May  15,  1970,  reporting  progress  made  in \ncompliance  with  tbis  ordeI';  and  that they  report  tberea£tel' \non  July  15,  August  15,  September  15  and  November  1, \n1970,  and  on  FebrUluy  1  and  May  1,  1971. \n5.  That  the  inte1'11al  operation  of  eacb  school,  and  the \nassignment  and management of school  employees, of course \nbe  conducted  on  a  lion-racial,  non-discriminatory  basis. \n16.  The  duty  imposed  by  the  law  alld  by  this  order  is \nthe  desegregation  of  schools  and  the  maintenance  of  that \ncondition.  The  plans  discussed  in  this  order,  whether  pre \npared by Board and  staff or by outside consultants,  such  as \ncomputer  expert, 111'.  John W. 'Veil, or Dr.  John  A.

This  exception  is  tbll t  black  students,  some  300 \nin number,  should.  be  assigned  from  map  294D,  2950, \ngrid~ \n295D,  and  BISA,  to  attcnd  Independence  High  School. \n19.  Although  the  Board  junior  high  school  plan  is \nit \ninferior  in  design  and  results  to  Fingcr's  plan,  is  a \nDl', \npurely  \"home  grown\"  product  and  the  court  would  like \nto  approve:  it,  if it can  he  brought  illto  compliallce  with  law \nby  desegregating  Piedmont  Junior  HiglJ  School,  and  by \nadding  transportation  as  aboye  indicated,  and  by  increas \ning  the  black  attendance  at  several  outlying  schools.  1'ho \nBoard may jf it wishes  consider  (1)  I'C-ZOnillg;  (2)  two-wo)\" \ntran;:;porting  of  pupils  between  outlying  schools  and  Pied-\n1I10nt;  (3)  closing  Piedmont  and  assigning  the  pupils  to \nAlbemarle  Road,  Cnrmel,  McClintock  amI  Quail  Hollow. \nUnless  the  court  has  becn  notified  ill  writing  by  noon  of \nFebruary  6,  1970,  of  an  affirmative  decision  adopting  one \nof  these  ehoice:::.  by  formal  Board  actioll,  the  junior  high \nschools  al'e  directed  to  be  desegregated  according  to  Dr. \nFinger's  plan,  as  illllstrated  hy  exhibits  E  and  F. \n20.  The  Board's  plan  for  clemcnta  schoo Is,  ill ustrll ted \n1')' \nby  exhibits  G  and  H,  cannot  he  approved  because  (I)  it \nretains  nine  schools  83%  to  100%  black,  serving  over  Laif \nthe  black  elementary  pupils,  and  (2)  it  leaves  approxi \nmately  half  the  31,500  white  elementary  students  atte11cling \nschools  that  are  86%  to  100ro  white;  and  (3)  it  promises \nto  provide  little  or  trallsportation  in  aid  of  desegrega \n110 \ntion,  evcll  though  the  plan's  zoncs  in  some  cases  are  ap \nparently  five  or  six  miles  long.  The  Board  plan  for  ele \nmelltaries  openly  rejects  the  duty  to  eliminate  all  the \nblack  schools. \nThe  Finger plan  uses  many  of the  same  basic  attendance \nlines  as  the  Board  plan;  however,  it.  does  1I0t  stop  short  of \n\n-\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n. \n121a \nOrder  dated  Febntary  5,  1970 \nthe constitutional  requirements, and by pairing and  cluster \ning  groups  of  schools  it  achieves  full  desegregation  of  the \nelementary  schools.  The  school  staff  worked  out  the  de-\n• \ntails  of  this  plan  and  are  familial'  with  it.  Its  attendance \nI; \nzones  are  illustrated  on  the  map,  exhibit  its  elementary \n• \nschool  populations  are  listed  in  exhibit  J;  and  the  pairing \nand  gl'Ouping  of  the  outlying  and  inner-city  schools,  grade \nby grade,  are  shown  in  detail  on  exhibit  K.  Subject  to  the \nqualifications  previously  stated,  the  Board  is  directed  to \nfollow  the l!-'inger  plan with reference to  elementary schools. \n21.  Deadlines  to  complete  yurious \nTHE  TlME  rrABLE: \nphases of the program required  in  this  order are as follows: \nHIGH  Seniors  may  remain  in  their \nSENIOR  SCHOOLS. \npresent  schools  until  the  end  of  the  school  the \n~Tear; \nBoard  may  make  any  decision  they  deem  wise  about \nallowing  seniors  to. transfer  before  graduation  to \nschools  where  their  race  will  be  in  the  minority.  Ele'v \nenth and  tenth graders  will  be  transferred to  their new \nschools  not  later  than  the  4th  day  of  May,  1970. \nHIGH  SCHOOLS  (Grades  7,  8,  9).  Complete \nJUNIOR \ndesegregation  shall  be  accomplished  not  later  than  the \n1st day  of  April,  1970. \nFACULTY.  Complete  desegregation  of  the  various \nfaculties  shall  be  accomplished  by  the  various  times \nset  out  above  for  desegregation  of  the  student  bodies. \n22.  MODIFICATIONS.  The intent.ion  of  this  order  is  to  put \non  the  Board  the full  duty  to  bring the  schools  into  compli \nance  with  the  Constitution  as  above  outlined,  but  to  leave \nmaximum  discretion  in  the  Board  to  choose  methods  that \nwill  accomplish  the  required  result.  However,  it is  directed \n\n122a \nOrder  dated  February  5,  1970 \nthat  leave  of  court  be  obtained  before  making  any  material \ndeparture  from  any  specific  reqnirement  set  out  herein. \nThe  court  will  undertake  to  rule  promptly  on  any  such \nrequests  for  deviation  from  prescribed methods. \n23.  The  comt  claims  no  infallibility  and  does \nAPPEAL.  . .  \nnot  seek  to  prevent  appeal  from  all  or  any  part  of  this \norder,  and  allow  the  making  of  any  record  needed  to \nwill \npresent  appeal  any  contention  the  parties  desire  to \nOIl \nmake,  and  will  do  what  this  court  can  to  expedite  such \nappeal.  However, in accordance with Whi.ttenberg v.

That  transportation  be  offered  on  a  lmiform \nnon-racial  basis  to  all children whose  attendance  ill  any \nsellOol  is necessary to  bring about  the  reductiOll  of seg \nregation,  and  who  live  farther  from  the  school  to \nwhich  they  are  assigned  than  the  Board  determines  to \nthe \nbe  walking  distance.  Estimates  of  number  of  chil \ndren who  may have  to  be  transported  have  run as high \nas  10,000  or  more.\" \nSince  February  5,  estimates  have  been  made  by  defen \ndants  that  paragraph  7  would  l'equire  transporting  more \nthan 23,000 pupils rather than 10,000 to  14,000,  as estimated \nat  the  hearing.  Upon  reviewing  the  evidence  i.ntroduced \nsince  that  hearing,  it  appears  that  these  higher  estimates \nmay  be  based  on  construing  the  above  language  of  para \ngraph  7  so  as  to  require  an  offer  of  transportation  to  all \n1% \nchildren  who  live  more  than  miles  from  their  school, \nincluding  city  children  who  are  not  now  entitled  to  tran \nsportation.  These,  according to  the  testimony,  may nnto bel' \nas  many  as  13,000. \nThe  court  regrets  any  lack  of  clarity  in  the  order  which \nmay  have  given  rise  to  this  interpretation.  Paragraph  7 \n• \nwas  never  intended  to  require  transportation  beyond  that \nnow  provided  by  law  for  city  children  who  are  not  re \nassigned,  nor  for  those  whose  reassif,'Tlments  are  not  re \nquired  by  the  desegregation  program. \nAccordingly,  paragraph  7  of  the  February  5,  1970  order \nis amended by deleting the words  \"attendance in  any school\" \nand  insert.ing  the  words  \"reassignment  to  nny  school,\"  in \ntbe  first  sentence. \nThis  the  3rd  day  of :March,  1970. \n/s/  B.

A year ago, this Court asked counsel for the school district \nwhether the board had not yet desegregated its schools.  The Court willleam in the \ncourse of this trial that the answer to its seemingly rhetorical question is, sadly, \"no\". \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 1 of 45\n\nI. STATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis matter was filed originally in 1965 by a group of African-American plaintiffs \nseeking to end segregation in the public schools of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. \nThe district and appellate courts upheld the school board's student assignment plan of \nMarch 1965.  But the plaintiffs moved for further relief in 1968, in light of intervening \nSupreme Court decisions urging immediate desegregation of the public schools.  Between \n1969 and 1974, this Court issued approximately twenty orders directing the school board \nto desegregate.  The Supreme Court affirmed two of those orders, from 1970, in it's \nlandmark 1971 decision, see, 402 U.S.  1,28 L. Ed. 2d 554, 91 S. Ct. 1267 (1971). \nHowever, this Court had to issue some ten additional orders directing the Board to \ndesegregate before placing the case on inactive status in 1975. \nIt was not until 1974 that the Board adopted, and the Court approved, a plan that \nfully involved the area known as Southeast Charlotte in the desegregation plan.  The plan \npaired schools, set up satellite zones and established guidelines for student assignment. \nNotably, the July 1974 Order approving that plan specitlcally endorsed the use of the \ncounty-wide \"optional schools\" as part of the board's proposed desegregation guidelines, \nso long, the Court admonished, as the Board provided transportation for students \nattending such schools, ensured broad notification and opportunity to enroll in them, and \ndid not allow such schools to become havens for \"freedom of choice\" and wreak \"havoc\" \non desegregation.  379 F. Supp. 1102, 1103-04 (W.O. N.C. 1974). \nFinally, in an order dated July 11, 1975, the court ended its active supervision of \nthe district, but specifically noted: \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 2 of 45\n\nThough continuing problems remain, as hangovers from previous \nactive discrimination, defendants are actively intelligently \naddressing these problems without court intervention ... \nThis case contains many orders of continuing effect, and could be \nre-opened upon proper showing that those orders are not being \nobserved ... \nThe duty to comply with existing court orders respecting pupil \nassignment of course remains.  So, also, does the duty to comply \nwith constitutional and other legal requirements respecting other \nforms ofracial discrimination. \n67 F.R.D 648, 649-50 (W.D.N.C. 1975).  Far from finding the district to have achieved \nunitary status, the court recognized continuing vestiges of the dual system  were present. \nThe 1975 order has remained unchanged. \nFo ur years later, this court found that '''racially neutral attendance patterns' have \nnever been achieved\" in this school district.  Martin v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of \nEd., 475 F. Supp. 1318,1340 (1979).  The court further found numerous other concerns \nleading it to conclude that \"discrimination has not been ended\", but left \"the continuing \nproblems of segregation 1 in the hands of the School Board ... \".  Id. at 1346-47.  The court \nfound that the Board had a continuing duty to avoid resegregation while addressing the \nvestiges and of segregation, and correctly observed: \nThe culture and attitudes and results of three centuries of segregation cannot be \neliminated nor corrected in ten years ... even in the hands of people of good will. .. \nThey need time to work their own experiments, and to find their own ways of \nproducing the sustained operation of a system of schools in which racial \ndiscrimination will play no part.\" \n!d. at 1347. \nI For example, dlscovery documents show that the federal government withheld $900,000 In funding In \n19n because of internal school segreganon. \n3 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 3 of 45\n\nIn 1980, the Court reopened the case to modify its prior orders and allow any \nelementary school, except Hidden Valley, to have a black enrollment up to 15% above \nthe system-wide percentage of black student enrollment. \nFrom 1970 through 1980, and then again from 1980-1990, residential segregation \nin Charlotte declined.  But by 1985, the number of schools out of compliance with the \nCourt order began to increase steadily.  In 1992, the Board adopted a widely-publicized \nplan to end the pairing of black and white schools and greatly expand the number of \ncounty wide optional or \"magnet\" schools in order to move away from the mandatory \nbusing of students and comply with the Court's orders.  As required by the 1974 order \nregarding the use ofcounty-wide optional schools, the Board provided transportation to \nthese schools, publicized their availability for enrollment and maintained racial \nguidelines Cor admission to avoid \"havoc\" in the system's efforts to comply with the \ncourt order.  However, the number of predominantly black schools, and the racial \nproportions in them, jumped that year and have increased every year since 1992. \nWilliam Capacchione, who is white, filed suit in September 1997 alleging that the \nBoard's use of racial goals in the magnet schools was not covered by the Court order, and \nthus was unconstltutional and discriminated against his daughter.  She was \"forced\", to \nattend her neighborhood school, McKee Road Elementary2  The Swann plaintiffs moved \nto reopen Swalln, showing the Court the existence of contimnng issues of discrimination \nin the operation of the schools. \n, McKee Road Elementary has among the highest test scores. Ihe most trained and experienced faculty, and \nthe best educational resources,  the district.  In deposition, Mr. Capacchione was unable to identify a \nIII \nsingle educational resource that his daughter would have obtained at the magnet school that she dId not \nhave at McKee Road.  His primary evidence of damage IS that hIS daughter was teased by her best friend \nand neighbor for not attending the magnet WIth her. \n4 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 4 of 45\n\nIn March 1998, the Court denied the school board's motion to dismiss \nCapacchione's complaint, granted the Swann plaintiffs' motion to reopen Swann, and \nconsolidated the two actions for trial.  In April 1998, the six Grant plaintiffs, all of whom \nare white, moved to intervene, complaining that the school district's continued \ncompliance with this Court's desegregation orders was unconstitutional and \ndiscriminated against them.  Like Capacchione, they seek damages essentially because \nthe board still complies with this Court's orders.  The Court allowed that motion to \nintervene. \nMr. Capacchione and his family moved to California prior to the start of the 1998-\n99 school year, and the Court entered partial judgment, dismissing any claims by him for \ninjunctive or declaratory relief. \nII. ISSUES \nAt the trial of this matter, the Court is faced with one fundamental question in \nequity·· is this school district unitary0  Before reaching that issue, this Court should \naddress, and can readily dismiss, the two separate legal claims, Mr. Capacchione's claim \nfor damages and the similar damage claims of the Grant intervenors.  The argument \nsection below explains each of these three issues separately.  But the Court should first \nreview some of the essential facts. \nIII.  Summary of the Facts \nAs the parties are submitting proposed findings offact, the plaintiffs will here \nsummarize some operative facts that the Court must review to detennine if this school \ndistrict is unitary. \n5 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 5 of 45\n\nA.  Student Assignment. \nThe trend in student assignment is unmistakable.  For the current school year, \nsome 25 schools are out of compliance with the Court's orders and are identifiably black. \nAnother thirteen schools are identifiably white.  These numbers are increasing on an \nannual basis.  The same trend is reflected in the number of students attending racially \nidentifiable schools.  About 30% of the black students in the district attend a school that \nis out of compliance with the court's orders.  Again, that percentage is steadily increasing \neach year.  A comparable number of whites attend racially imbalanced white schools. \nFurther, internal segregation within ostensibly integrated schools hides from the \ngross numbers of racial composition.  The district uses tracking at the secondary level \nwith a profound racial impact.  At the elementary level, school district data shows that \n35.5% of black students in racially balanced schools are nonetheless learning in \nsegregated classrooms. \nOne cause of these imbalances is the magnet program itself.  There is evidence \nthat the Board has not monitored effectively the impact of the magnet programs on the \nsending schools.  In fact, the magnets have created or exacerbated racial imbalances in \npredominantly black, non-magnet schools.  The programs also sometimes create the \nillusion of desegregation by placing magnet programs inside schools that are racially \nimbalanced.  Such programs often do not actually integrate the classrooms in a school, as \nthe students in some magnets do not attend classes with students in the \"regular\" \nprogram.  Thus, magnet programs can appear to balance attendance numbers at the \nbuilding without desegregating the classrooms in the building. \n6 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 6 of 45\n\nThe plaintiff-intervenors however look only at the gross, building-level data. \nThey claim that the trend towards segregation is the result of demographics, not of school \nboard policy, and that the board cannot be held responsible legally for these trends. \nHowever, data from the intervenors own expert indicates that the most significant \ndemographic trend is the dispersal of blacks --that the County has become less \nsegregated residentially over the same time that the schools have become more \nsegregated.  By the intervenor's evidence, the school system should be easier to \ndesegregate now, not harder. \nMost importantly, the demographics of Charlotte are not those of DeKalb County, \nGa., the locus of the Supreme Court's decision in Freemall v.Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 118 L. \nEd. 2d 2108,112 S. Ct. 1430 (1992).  In DeKalb County, the black popUlation had \nexploded from 5% to 47% of that county's population in approximately fifteen years, and \nthe county had split into two sharply distinct racial areas.  The Supreme Court found that \nsuch an extreme level of demographic change overwhelmed the DeKalb school board's \nability to deal with the resulting imbalances in its schools.  It could do nothing short of \nmassive bussing to remedy the situation; something the parties agreed was not a viable \noption. Jd., 503 U.S. at 481, 118 L. Ed. 2d. at 128.  Those sorts of changes simply have \nnot occurred in Charlotte. \nIn Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the percentages of blacks and whites has stayed fairly \nconstant over thirty years.  The percentage of black students in the district has risen only \nincrementally since 1980 - from about 38% then to about 41 % today.  The most notable \ndemographic change has not been polarization of the county into two racial zones, but the \ndispersal of the black population throughout the county.  Logically, with bussing  use, \n111 \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 7 of 45\n\nthe increase in school segregation in a district becoming more integrated residentially \nshows a failure by the district to take advantage of the generally improved demographics. \nBy utilizing midpoint schools, for example, as written Board policy espoused. \nThe intervenors' emphasis on demographics masks the true issues of decision \nmaking by the school board.  Unlike DeKalb County, racial demographic change in \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg is not overwhelming the board and leaving it unable to respond to \nimbalance in its schools. The early orders in this case admonished the Board to site \nschools in order to promote integration.  It has not.  And, since 1992, southeast Charlotte \nhas once again removed itself from full involvement in desegregation. \nIndeed, the intervenors ignore evidence that it is the board's school assignment \ndecisions that have increased racial imbalances.  Crestdale Middle School provides an \nillustration.  The record shows that the school board paid a premium to purchase land \nncar Highway 74 to site a new school there that could be easily integrated with \ntransportation.  But when the school opened, the board bowed to political pressure to fill \nthe sparkling, state-of-the-art school with students from southeast Charlotte.  Rather than \nopen as a school with 40-45% black students as planned, the new school is only 16% \nblack, almost all of them assigned by individual request under a Majority to Minority \ntransfer plan.  The racial composition of other middle schools in the east side of Charlotte \nbecame more imbalanced as a result of this decision. \nThe board already uses a desegregation tool not available in Freeman, and has the \nadvantage ofa demographic trend opposite from that of Freeman. both of which should \nassist, not impede, desegregation.  Yet, the schools have become more segregated. \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 8 of 45\n\nB.  Faculty Assil:nment \nThe trend to segregation in faculty assignment is also unmistakable, and has two \naspects.  First, the number of schools with racially imbalanced faculty is increasing \ndramatically.  This school year, there are 40 schools where the faculty composition varies \nby more than 10% from the system average, a standard cited with approval in Freeman. \nThat figure is up from 31 schools in 1997-98, 28 in 1996-97 and 19 in 1994-95. \nSecond, the statistical correlation between the racial composition of a school's \nstudent body and its faculty has increased dramatically since 1992.  The data shows a \nstrong statistical correlation between the race of the students at a school and that of the \nfaculty.  Thus, between the trends in student and faculty assignment, the district is \nmoving away trom, rather than toward, \"a system without a 'white' school and a 'Negro' \nschool, but just schools.\" Green v.  County School Board a/New Kent County, 391 U.S. \n430.442,88 S. Ct 1689, 1696,20 L. Ed. 2d 716, 726. \nC.  Facilities \nThe inequity in facilities is a central concern ofthis case, and a profound \ndistinction from Freeman.  There, the Plaintiffs \"conceded\" that the district had achieved \nunitary status regarding facilities.  503 U.S. 484, 118 L.Ed.2d 130.  Here that is not the \ncase. \nSome thirty years ago the board closed many of its \"black\" schools because their \nconditions were so inferior.  Today, about 80% of the predominantly black schools need \nto be bulldozed or completely renovated.  There will be testimony at trial about the \nappalling physical conditions in many of the predominantly black schools. \nSuperintendent Smith, for example, has testified to his shock when he arrived at seeing \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 9 of 45\n\nthe physical condition and disrepair of Charlotte's predominantly black schools.  The \nonly evidence from the intervenors to contradict this factual reality is the assertion by one \nof their experts, who has no professional training in facilities' evaluation, and apparently \nhas never testified as a facilities expert, that he visited thirteen of the district's 130 \nschools and found their condition \"satisfactory,\" \nIf the school district is to move towards unitary status, it must first address the \ninequities in physical facilities. \nD.  Material Resources \nThe inequities in physical facilities arc compounded by the disparities in basic \neducational resources at those same schools.  Evidence at trial will show that the board \nhas attempted to establish a base line of material resources at each grade level, from basic \nclassroom supplies, to library books, to computers,  It has found that predominantly black \nschools need twice as much money per pupil as predominantly white schools to reach that \nbase line\" \nE.  Transportation \nThere is continuing concern that blacks bear a disproportionate burden in being \ntransported for racial balancmg, particularly since the end of depairing.  There are no \nwhite satellite zones into predominantly black schools, for example; only black satellite \nzones into white schools, or, oddly, black zones mto predominantly black schools,  And, \nbecause the board has not built or expanded schools in the urban part of the county or in \nsuburban areas already integrated, black students mllst be transported to find seats, \n3 Data on the most important resource, teachers, presents very SeriOUS concerns as well.  That Issue is \ndIscussed in section F, \"QuaUty Education\", \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 10 of 45\n\nF.  Extracurricular Activities \nThe evidence will show racial disparities in co-curricular organizations that are \ninextricahly linked to racial disparities in cUlTicular enrollments, which leads to perhaps \nthe most disturbing evidence of continuing discrimination: what is called in Freeman. \n\"quality of education.\" \nG.  Quality of Education \nThis term is an umbrella of issues relatcd to equal opportunities in education, \nsomething the intervenors' expert agrees is a valid issue for Court review in this case. \nThe concerns come in several categories. \nFirst are the concerns about teachers.  The data show that teachers in the \npredominantly black schools tend to be less experienced and less educated than elsewhere \nin the system.  Of particular concern, as noted by outside observers, is the high rate of \ntcacher turnover in the predominantly black schools and a much higher proportion of new \nteachers there.  In these same schools, unsurprisingly, the rates of suspension and other \nfonns oflost student time are among the highest in the district. \nSecond are issues of student achievement.  This Court originally ordered \ndesegregation, in part, to address gross disparities in student achievement.  The Board has \nnot yet begun to address that issue effectively.  The intervenors claim that these \nachievement disparities are solely the result of socio-economics rather than race \ndiscrimination by the district, and that the disparities are comparable to national trends. \nThe facts show otherwise. \nSocio-economics clearly do not explain significant facts.  For example, the data \nshow that the scores on end of year tests of the group of white students poor enough to \n11 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 11 of 45\n\nqualify for free and reduced lunch are consistently similar to the scores of black students \nwho are not subsidized.  That is, broadly speaking, middle and upper income blacks in \nthe district score comparably to the poorest whites.  Something is wrong with that picture. \nIt surprises many to lean that, nationally, the test score gap has closed measurably since \n1970.  [n many categories, it had been cut in halfby 1988.  The intervenor's expert's \nblack/white testing data does not show any comparable closing of the gap in Charlotte. \nAt one end of the spectrum stand the advanced and gifted classes, where blacks \nare woefully underrepresented.  At the other end are special education classes, where \nblacks are over-represented. and more likely to be diagnosed as retarded or behaviorally \nhandicapped. \nPart of the explanation comes from the manner in which the district groups and \ntracks students, which has a dramatic effect on student achievement.  Few blacks are \nenrolled in advanced courses, or in the courses in lower grades that are prerequisite to the \nadvanced classes.  While the intervenors seem to argue that blacks either do not qualify \nor do not seek out these courses, the data shows a more pernicious problem.  A review of \nSixth Grade CAT test data shows starkly that black and white students with similar test \nscores that year were often placed in different tracks in later years.  Black students were \nplaced in lower level classes than whites with similar Sixth Grade test scores.  With \nplacement flows a decline in goals, expectations, and achievement. \nFinally, there is the issue of student discipline.  Not only are black students \ndisciplined in larger numbers than non-blacks, they also are more likely to receive a more \nsevere punishment than a non-black for the same offense.  A higher percentage of blacks \nwho commit a specific disciplinary offense are suspended from school than non-blacks \n12 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 12 of 45\n-------\"\" \",,-_._------\n\nwho commit the same offense.  That is true for every category of offense but the zero \ntolerance violations - weapons and drugs, which are applied unifonnly.  In every \ncategory where discretion is allowed, black students are more likely than whites to be \nsuspended from school. \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Unitary Status \nThe issue properly before this Court is whether the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school \ndistrict is unitary.  Once found to have violated the constitution, a school board must \ntallow a court's orders until there is a judicial detennination that it has remedied its \nactions and their consequences.  That is, a court must detennine that a school system has \ntaken \"all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of segregation ... [to ensure that) .... \nthe Injuries and stigma inflicted upon  ... black students are ... no longer present.\" \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 485.  Until there is such ajudicial detennination, this school board \nmust comply with the Court's remedial orders. \nTwo points must be kept in mind.  First, a school board remains under the \nobligation to meet the court's orders until freed from it.  The intervenors case is built in \nsubstantial part on a theory that the Board has been de facto unitary.  There is no such \ncreature.  Counsel for the intervenors argued a variant of this theme in United States v. \nGeorgia,  F 3d __,  No. 97-9199, (II th Cir. April 8, 1999), a case involving \nunitary status of the Troup County, Ga. schools.  (A copy of the yet to be published \ndecision is attached.) Counsel urged at trial that the language in a decision deactivating \nthe case in 1973 had rendered the school district unitary.  Last week, the Eleventh Circuit \ndisagreed; declaring that unitary status could only be detemlined after a fact-finding \n13 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 13 of 45\n\nhearing convened for that purpose.  That is the case that wi 11 be tried before this Court. \nNo other mechanism can make this school system.  And, until it is declared unitary, a \nschool board has \"the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to \nconvert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and \nbranch.\"  ld., at 511, (Blackmun, J., concurring, quoting Green, citations omitted). \nSecond, the intervenors focus on the issue of student assignment and ask the court \nto declare the district unitary in that singular respect.  Freeman makes it clear that the \ntrial court must look at the entire operatlOn of the school district before determining if it \nis unitary in whole or any PaIt.  Since it is \"the operation of a racially segregated school \nsystem that must be remedied,\"  Freeman, 503 US at 5 I 0 (Blackmun, J., concurring), all \nof the various facets of the school system \"must be free from discrimination\" before it is \ncompletely unitary.  ld., at 486 (Kennedy, 1.). Or, as stated by Justice Scalia, the courts \nmust \"afford remedies that eliminate not only the discrimination but its identified \nconsequences.\" ld., at 506. \nFreeman makes unmistakable the obligation of a trial court to look at all evidence \nof both past and present discrimination in determining the question of unitary status. \nThus, the Freeman trial court acted properly in deciding \nto address the elements of a unitary system discussed in Green, to inquire whether \nother elements ought to be identi fied, alld to determine whether minority students \nwere being disadvalllaged in ways that required the formulation of new and \nji,rther remedies to ensure full compliance with the COUri 's decree. \nId., at 492 (emphasis added). \nFreeman also emphasized that the Green factors are not a rigid framework, and \nthat each factor is not to be viewed in isolation from the others.  In fact, \"two or more \nGreen factors may be intertwined or synergistic in their relation so that a constitutional \n14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 14 of 45\n\nviolation in one area cannot be eliminated unless the judicial remedy addresses other \nmatters as well.\"  Ill., at 497.  That is, \"The components ofa school desegregation plan \nare interdependent upon, and interact with, one another, so that changes with respect to \none component may impinge upon the success or the failure of another.\"  Id., at 497-98, \nquoting. Vaughns v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George's County. 742 F Supp 1275, 1291 (D. \nMd. 1990).  As described by Justice Souter, the trial court should be concerned that a \n\"vestige of discrimination on one factor will act as an incubator for resegregation on \nothers.\"  Id.. at 508. \nThus, a trial court must weigh carefully the systemic impact of even a partial \ndeclaration of unitary status.  Freeman established a three-part inquiry for deciding \nwhether a tnal court should relinquish control of all or any particular facet of a school \nsystem. \n1.  Compliance with Order \nA trial court must first consider \"whether there is full and satisfactory compliance \nwith the court's decree in those aspects of the system where supervision is to be \nwithdrawn.\"  503 US at 491.  That is, the distnct must look at whether the vestiges of \nsegregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable.  Bd. of Educ. Oklahoma City \nv.  Dowell.  498 US 237, 249-50.  In making this inquiry, the Court must be mindful of \nand apply the presumption that current disparities are traceable to the unconstitutional \nprior discrimination. \na.  The Presumption \nIt remains an established principle of school desegregation that, \"once state \nenforced school segregation is shown to have existed in a jurisdiction in 1954, there \n15 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 15 of 45\n\narises a presumption,  ... that any current racial imbalance is the product of that \nviolation.\"  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. at 505,112 S.Ct. at 1453, 118 L.Ed.2d at143 \n(Scalia, J. conculTing). This presumption imposes on the party seeking to end the \ndesegregation order \"the substantial burden of demonstrating the absence of a causal \nconnection between any current condition of segregation and [the constitutional \nviolation].\"  Brown v. Board ofEduc. of Topeka. 978 F.2d 585, 590 (loth Cir. 1992). \nSince the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools have not been declared unitary, this burden \nrests on the intervenors to show that there is no causal connection, even one that is \n\"subtle and intaugible, \" Freeman, 503 US at 496, between constitutional violations \nfound in the past by this court and current discriminatory conditions. \nThe Fourth Circuit has embraced this burden shifting framework in desegregation \ncases, holding that the burden of proving discnminatory intent or a constitutional \nviolation in present-day disparities shifts only after a school system has been found \nunitary.  See, School Bd. of the Cit}, olRichmond, VA.  v. Haliles, 829 F.2d 1308 at 1311 \n(4th Cif. 1987}(\"[t is well establisbed that once a court has found an unlawful dual school \nsystem, the plainllffs are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are causally \nrelated to prior segregation, and the burden of proving otherwise rest on the \ndefendants.\"); Riddick hy Riddick v.  School Bd. of City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521 at 538 \n(4th Cif. 1(86), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 938, 107 S.C!. 420, 93 L.Ed.2d 370 (1986); \nVaughns v. Bd. ofEduc. of Prince George's COUllty,  758 F.2d 983, 991 (4th Cif. \n1985)(\"[b ]ecause the County's school system had not attained unitary status, it is settled \nlaw that plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption that current  ... disparities were \n16 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 16 of 45\n\ncausally related to prior segregation and that the burden of proving otherwise rested on \ndefendants\"). \nBecause the intervenors seek a declaration that the school system is unitary, the \nburden of overcoming the presumption is theirs.  Freeman reaffirmed that the party \nseeking a unitary declaration\" bears the burden of showing that any current imbalance is \nnot traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior violation.\"  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. at \n494, 118 L.Ed. 2d at 137.  In Keyes v. School District, the Court also rejected the idea \nthat the passage of time might cause the burden to shift, holding \"[ cJ ertainly plaintiffs in \na school desegregation case are not reqUIred to prove 'cause' in the sense of 'non \nattenuation.'\"  See, 413 U.S. at 211 n. 17,93 S.C!. at 2699 n.  17. \nHere the Court will find growing imbalances in student and faculty assignment.  It \nwill learn that near one-third of the black students attend segregated schools, with \nsubstandard facilities, lacking in equal basic resources where the tcachers have less \nexperience and training.  The Court will also learn that black students are steered away \nfrom demanding courses, are over-represented in special education and are disciplined \nmore often and more severely.  As a consequence, they lag behind in achievement.  This \nis not Alissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 115 S.C!. 2038, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995), where \nefforts at remediation had tried and failed.  This is the school system creating barriers to \nachievement. \nThe intervenors must overcome the presumption, as well as the common sense \nconclusion, tbat these present problems are remnants of segregation.  Their main \nargument is that demography explains all imbalances, that the buildings in majority black \nneighborhoods arc just plain old, and that blacks do poorly only because they are poor. \n17 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 17 of 45\n~-------~----~-~.---------------~~-\n\nBut the school imbalances are contrary to the overall residential demographic trend since \n1970, which indicates that the schools should be easier to integrate now, not more \ndifficult.  The age of the buildings does not begin to explain the way they are \nmaintained, the educational resources they offer, or the experience and training of their \nstaffs.  And the record on achievement shows that the board has never systematically and \ncontinually addressed the racial barriers to black students' academic achievement. \n2.  Synen.:y and Interdepend~ \n[fthis Court concludes that the Board has eliminated the vestiges of segregation \nin some aspect of the school system, it must then determine whether retention of judicial \ncontrol over that aspect of the system \"is necessary or practicahle to achieve compliance \nin other facets of the school system.\"  503 U.S. at 497.  Freeman, which involved no \nissues of facility equal!ty, explicitly recognized that \"[r]acial halancing in elementary and \nsecondary school student assignments may be a legitimate remedial device to COlTect \nother Jimdamental inequities that were caused by the constitutional violation.  Id. \n(emphasis added).  The Freeman Court went on to cite examples of cases where it and \nother courts had found a synergy, or interdependence, between distinct aspects of a \nschool system (see citations at 503 U.S. 497), but noted that at the Freeman trial \"[t]here \nwas no showing that racial balancing was an appropriate mechanism to cure deficiencies \nin this case.\"  503 U.S. at 498. \nUnlike Freeman, there will be a showing here that student assignment is an \nessential mechanism for maintaining a modicum of racial equity until the school board \naddresses the needs of the predominantly black schools.  To declare student assignment \nunitary and relinquish control would wreak havoc on black students and parents, ordering \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 18 of 45\n\nthem back into the very situation this court tried to abolish years ago  racially isolated, \ninferior schools that cast a stigma on the children attending them. Post-Freeman, courts \nthat have applied the interdependence analysis have declined to release an aspect of \nschool operations form supervision.  See, Jenkins v. Missouri, 122 FJd 588 (8th Cir. \n1997); Stone v.  Prince George's County, (1992 WL 238254)( 4th Cir.)(unpublished \nopinion, citing Freeman to affirm decision of district court as to interdependence of \nGreen factors in Vaughns v. Prince George's County, 742 F.Supp. 1275 (D. Md, 1990): \nMallllillgs v. Hillshorough, 24 F. Supp, 2d 1277 (M.D. Fla, 1998).  Because of the \ninterdependence of the Green factors here, this court cannot relinquish control of student \nassignment at this time. \n3.  Good Faith. \nThe third step in the court's inquiry into relinquishing partial control is to \ndetermine whether the school district has \"demonstrated, to the public and to the parenls \nlind stucienls of the once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to the whole of the \ncourt's decree.\"  Freeman, 503 U.S, 491,118 L.Ed.2d 135, (emphasis added).  The key \nhere is that the Court must find not merely that it is satisfied with the board's \ncommitment to desegregation, but that the pUblic, especially the minority community, has \n\"assurance against further injuries or stigma.\"  503 U.S. 498, 118 L.Ed.2d 139.  One need \nonly look at the current condition of the predominantly black schools, or witness the \nastonislunent of some black parents when they see the patently superior conditions at \npredominantly white schools, or Jearn that middle class black students are scoring  tests \n011 \nat the same level as white students in poverty, to understand that the school board has Ilot \n19 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 19 of 45\n\nyet done enough to show the minority community that it is committed to the equal \nprotection guarantees of the Constitution. \nIn sum, because of the multiple problems of race discriminatlOn and inequity, the \nschool system is not now unitary.  That is the sad answer to the Court's question of one \nyear ago. \nB,  The Intervenors Do Not Have Damal:e Claims. \nThe COUli should dispense with the damage claims at the outset of these \nproceedings.  The intervenors theorize that they are somehow entitled to damages.  It is \nimperative that this Court cut through that legal fiction.  This litigation properly involves \nonly the equitable powers of this Court.  Until this district is declared unitary, it remains \nunder an affirmative obligation to follow the Court's orders and not only may, but also \nmust take race into account.  No authority supports the proposition that a non-unitary \nschool district can be held liable for following a court's mandate. \nThe issue is solely whether the school board has eliminated past and present \ndiscrimination against black students, which it IS the intervenors' burden to prove, and \nwhat continuing or further equitable remedies for that discrimination are necessary. \nBeyond those questions, there is no legal or factual basis to support the intervenors claim \nfor damages. \nTo find legal liability against a school board because it followed this Court's \norders, which the Supreme Court affirmed, would establish an astounding legal precedent \n- that a public body cannot rely on the orders of a court or the holdings of the highest \n20 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 20 of 45\n\ncourt in the land, to guide its actions.  That is a precedent that even Mr. Capacchione \nagrees does not exist. \nI.  Capaccbione's Damal:e Claim Sbould Be Dismissed. \nIn response to the school board's motion in October 1997 to dismiss Mr. \nCapacchione's complaint, Plaintiffs counsel noted that his client challenged the magnet \nprogram on the essential premise that the program fell outside the Court's orders.  He \nagreed then that he could not challenge the magnet program if it had been adopted by the \nBoard in order to meet its obligations under the Court order.  Plaintiff's Brief Opposing \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss, p.l.  Capacchione's lawsuit is based on his factually and \nlegally mistaken belief that the magnet program was not promulgated to meet the Court's \ndesegregation orders in general, and was not covered by the Court's July 1974 order \nspecitlcally.  Instead, he claims that the magnet plan was a wholly independent and \nunlawful effort by the school board to attain diversity through racial discrimination.  Id. \nat pp. 4, 6, & 7 (Capacchione \"does not challenge any order of this Court\"). \nThe Board asserted in its motion to dismiss that it had adopted the magnet \nprogram as a means of complying with this Court's orders.  Capacchione argued \nstridently that this was an issue of/act that could not be raised properly at the Rule 12 \nstage of the proceedings and could not constitute grounds for granting the motion to \ndismiss.  He objected to the Board putting factual assertions before the Court at that time. \nId. at p. 15-16.  He recognized that he could not -- and insisted that he did not - \ncollaterally attack the Swann orders.  He acknowledged that it would be an impermissible \ncollateral attack if the magnet program were covered by the Court's orders.  He asked, in \nthe alternative to dismissing hiS claim, that the Court allow him to intervene in the \n21 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 21 of 45\n\nreopening of Swann.  ld., at p. 8.  Capacchione thus demonstrated his awareness of a \ncentral legal issue that the other intervenors ignore _. one party cannot sue another for \nfollowing a binding court order; the only remedy is to seek modification ofthe order. \n2.  Capacchione Has No Standinl: For The Issues In Swallll. \nUnder this Court's Order ofpm1ial summary judgment against Capacchione, he \nno longer has standing to intervene in Swanll.  The remedies and issues in Swann are \nsolely equitable, and Capacchione's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief have been \ndismissed.  Thus, Capacchione can remain in this lawsuit only ifhe can show as a matter \nof fact that the magnet program was not adopted and operated in an attempt to meet the \nBoard's obligations under, and was not covered by, the Court's orders.  He must also \nshow that operating such programs in a non-unitary district was unlawful.  He faces \ninsurmountable problems in making this showing. \nFirst, the evidence developed in discovery, including the testimony of persons \ninvolved in the decision to move towards greater use of magnets, the substantive content \nof the documents the board and staffreviewed in considering and adopting the magnet \nplan in March 1992 (including the so-called Stolce report), and the contents of the several \nMagnet School Assistance Program (MSAP) applications and reports to the federal \ngovernment, pennit no dispute that the magnet plan was intended to meet the Board's \nobligation under the Court's order to operate desegregated schools. \nCapacchione's second problem involves the July 1974 Court order expressly \napproving the Board's use of county-wide \"optional\" schools, an option that the Board \nexercised from that time forward.  The reality is that the 1992 magnet program did not \nintroduce magnets, but merely expanded their number.  The Board has operated \n22 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 22 of 45\n\ncountywide magnets at several schools since the 1974 order, including \"open\" programs \nat West Charlotte High School, Piedmont Middle School, and Irwin Ave. Elementary \nSchool, and \"traditional\" schools at Elizabeth and Myers Park elementary schools and \nHawthorne Middle School.  To say that the Court's 1974 order did not address magnet \nschools is simply wrong as fact and law. \nFinally, the testimony of Capac chione's and Grant's joint expert, Dr. Armor, is \ncompletely contrary to the intervenors' theory that this district's use of magnets is \nunlawful or discriminatory.  Dr. AmlOr testified that magnet schools are a standard tool \nfor accomplishing desegregation wIdely accepted by the courts.  He himself has drawn up \ndesegregation plans based on race-conscious magnet schools.  Armor, Dep., p 163,1123-\n24, P 180,1116-25  Like eMS's program, his own proposals use racial goals and hold \nseats to accomplish desegregation.ld. . p 165, II 1-25.  Moreover, Dr. Armor testified that \nhe had not reviewed the CMS magnet programs, including the one at issue in \nCapacchione's case, and had no opinion as to their lawfulness.  ld., p 185, 1111-12.  Dr. \nArmor explained simply that he was not working for Mr. Capacchione, but just for the \nother IIltervenors.  Id., II 9-10. \nGiven the uncontestable facts that (1) the magnet programs at issue were adopted \nby the Board to meet its obligations under the court order; (2) the court order of July \n1974 expressly permitted, indeed encouraged, the use of such schools, and the Board has \noperated them for 25 years; and, (3) Capacchione's purported expert witness (a) has not \nanalyzed, and does not have an opinion as to, whether the school board operates its \nmagnets in a discriminatory or unlawful fashion - indeed, he advocates their use as a \ndesegregation tool; and (b) that he does not work for Capacchione; Mr. Capacchione \n23 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 23 of 45\n\ncannot put on any factual evidence, expert testimony or legal basis to remain in this \nlawsuit.  He is left only with the claim that he has been damaged by the Board's \ncompliance with the Court's July 1974 desegregation order.  This is a claim he conceded \nover a year ago that he could not bring. \nThe Court should dismiss him from this litigation. \n3.  The Intervenors Do Not Have A Leila] Basis to Seek Damalles. \nSome of the reasons for dismissing Capacchione from this suit apply equally to \nthe damage claims of the other intervenors.  They, too, seek damages for discrimination \nstemming solely from actions taken by the Board to comply with this Court's orders. \nThe intervenors make this claim without any case authority that holds or even implies \nthat a school board can be liable for damages to white persons for desegregating its \nschools under a post-trial order, affirmed by the Supreme Court, to remedy long-standing \ndiscrimination against black students.  See, e.g, United States v.  Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, \n167 (defendant had a compelling interest in complying with the district court order after a \nfinding of discrimination). \nIn discovery and pleadings, the intervenors have asserted that the school system \nhas been unitary with regard to pupil assignment for years, so the board has violated the \nintervenors civil rights by continuing to use race-based student assignment.  They also \nhave claimed at different times that this Court in previous orders declared the district \nunitary in other aspects, thereby removing that factual issue from the case.  It is not clear \nthat the intervenors will advocate both of those positions before this Court, but it is \ncritical that this Court recognizes the legal fallacies in these propositions. \n24 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 24 of 45\n\nUntil Freeman was decided, there was no such creature as \"partial' unitary status \nin the Fourth Circuit.  Under Riddick v. School Board ofN  orfolk, 784 F.2d 521 (4th Cif. \n1986), and Bradley v.  School Board ofR  ichmond 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1973), the law \nwas clearly established that a school district in this Fourth Circuit could be declared \nunitary only after it had remedied all aspects of discrimination in its system. Indeed, it \nwas the conflict between the circuits on the issue of incremental versus wholesale unitary \nstatus that led the Court to grant certiorari in Freeman.  No District Court in this circuit \nhad the authority to grant partial unitary status prior to Freeman. \nMoreover, in Marlin, ante, this Court expressly rejected the argument posited \nhere, that the Board must stop taking race into account.  The Court found numerous \ncontinuing, interdependent problems of discrimination that precluded it from relieving \nthe Board of its student assignment obligations. \nFor these reasons, prior orders of this court referring to \"unitariness\" in some \naspect of school operations had no legal effect.  This school board simply had no legal \nbasis to understand that it was \"partially\" unitary.  In short, the intervenors' argument that \nthe Board acted unconstitutionally regarding student assignment prior to 1992 is barred as \na matter of law. \nTo prove that the Board violated their civil rights after Freeman, the intervenors \nmllst establish not only that the district was partially unitary sometime after 1992, but \nalso that the board decided in bad faith not to seek unitary status for the intended purpose \nof violating the intervenors' civil rights, rather than in a good faith belief that it was not \nyet unitary.  There is no evidence to support a finding of had faith. \n25 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 25 of 45\n\nPrior to a declaration of unitariness, this Board is not just pennitted, but is \nrequired, to take race into account in assigning students until a court relieves it of that \nobligation following a proper hearing.  Absent a showing that it was unlawful for the \nBoard to comply with this Court's orders, none of the plaintiff intervenors has a claim of \nliability, let alone damages.  If, however, this Court nevertheless concludes that it was \nunlawful for the Board to comply with the Court's own orders, it must then consider \nevidence of actual damages.  The Swann plaintiffs believe that none has been presented \nin discovery. \n4.  School Deseereeation Cases Do Not Permit Monetary Damaees. \nThe intervenors' claims for damages also ignores the unique nature of school \ndesegregation litigation.  These are cases involving equitable relief only.  As the Supreme \nCourt noted in Swann and repeated in Freeman. \"a school desegregation case does not \ndiffer fundamentally from the other cases involving the framing of equitable remedies to \nrepair the denial of a constitutional right.\"  402 U.S. at 15-16, quoted in Freeman at 503 \nU.S. 487 (emphasis added).  Even in cases slIch as Jenkins v. Missouri, 967 F.2d 1248 \n(8th Cir. 1992), and Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken II). 433 U.S. 267, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745, 97 \nS. Ct. 2749 (1977), where state governments were directed by a court to pay a portion of \nthe cost of remedial plans, those payments went to the school districts to run programs --\nnone of the individual plaintiffs received money.  As noted by the Eighth Circuit,  \"[a] \nschool desegregation case differs from much other litigation in that the main action does \nnot result in a monetary recovery ... The only award received by the plaintiffs in a \ndesegregation case is simply payment of their attorney's fees.\"  Jenkins v. Missouri, 967 \nF.2d 1248 (8th Cir. 1992). \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 26 of 45\n\nIf these intervenors believe that circumstances have changed such that the Court's \nremedies are now improper, their lawful remedy is to have the Court's order modified, \nlessened or withdrawn, not to obtain monetary relief. \n5.  The Intervenors Have Not Shown Evidence of Compensable Injnries. \nAssuming, arguendo. that the board could somehow be liable for nominal \ndamages because it violated the intervenors' rights by following this Court's orders, the \nintervenors have not demonstrated that they have suffered actual damages. As this court \nis aware, under Price v.  City 0/ Charlotte. 93 F.3d 1241 (4th Cif. 1996), the intervenors \nmust present evidence of actual compensable injury to recover damages·  They have not. \nAn award of compensatory damages to those seeking to overturn a desegregation \norder on the grounds of the alleged \"injuries\" described in discovery would disdainfully \ntrivialize the import of the original desegregation cases, where not a single plaintiff \nreceived a dime despite suffering the deprivations and gross injustices inflicted by de Jure \nsegregation -- injuries which the intervenors recognize were horrendous.  They, also, \nwere injuries whose remnants and present manifestations create more obstacles to, and \ndeprivations of, educational opportunity than any that the intervenors will ever have to \nexperience. \nIn sum, the parties have a vigorous dispute about the need for further equitable \nremedies at this time.  The Court should focus on that issue at equity, its sole and proper \nconcern, and jettison the claims for damages as improvident and not cognizable under the \nlaw. \n4 The Court will recall in the PrIce cases that the CIty of Charlotte did not attempt to rely on the consent \ndecree as a defense.  In this case, the Order is a bar to the damage claim. \n27 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 27 of 45\n\nIV  REMEDY \nIf the Court finds that the school district is not unitary, as it should under the facts \nand law, then it would be appropriate for the Court to ask that Board to present a plan for \nachieving unitary status.  The Board has held public hearings in which it has described its \nproposal to the community.  The Swann plaintiffs will comment on that plan in more \ndetail at an appropriate time.  But they do have concerns that the Board's plan to move in \nthree years to a \"controlled choice\" scheme is unwarrantedly optimistic about the time it \nwill take to rebuild and renovate the sixteen predominantly black scbools identified in the \nplan.  That is a principal cornerstone to any choice scheme.  The Court should ensure the \nfoundation is in place, before declaring this district unitary. \nIf the Court finds the district unitary, it simply must dismiss the case and have no \nfurther Jurisdiction over the school system. \n28 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 28 of 45\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI certify that I have served the foregoing TRIAL BRIEF on opposing \ncounsel by placing a copy thereof enclosed in a postage prepaid properly addressed \nwrapper in a post office or official depository under the exclusive care and custody of the \nUnited States Postal Service, addressed to: \nJohn O.

OVERV1EW \nThe United States and Charles Ridley !l!~. (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") appeal from the \ndistrict court's order of September 30, 1997 (\" 1997 Order\"), ruling that continued federal court \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 32 of 45\n\nsupervision of the Troup County School District was inappropriate.  The district court based its \ndecision on its interpretation of a previous order in the case, entered many years earlier by the \nthree-judge district court in United States v. Georgi~ No. 12, 972 (N.D. Ga. July 23, 1973) \n(\" 1973 Order\").  The 1973 Order involved the Troup County School District and numerous other \nschool districts in the area.  The 1997 Order construed the 1973 Order as having found that the \nTroup County School District had achieved \"unitary status,\" and went on to conclude that federal \ncoun oversight of the district was therefore no longer proper.  The district court accordingly \nvacated its prior order approving a 1995 consent decree entered into by the parties outlining a \nnew desegregation plan and dismissed the case.  Plaintiffs contend that the district court \nmisinterpreted the 1973 Order by incorrectly reading it as having bestowed \"unitary status\" on the \nTroup County School District and therefore wrongly dismissed the case.  For the reasons stated \nbelow, we agree.  Accordingly, we reverse and remand. \nII  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case began as a statewide suit filed by the United States on August 1, 1969, against \nthe State of Georgia and eighty-one public school districts, including that ofTroup County, to \ndesegregate the schools in those districts.  On December 17, 1969, the United States District \nCoun for the Northern District of Georgia issued a detailed regulatory injunction, specifYing the \ndefendants' duties under Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686 (1954).  In \n2 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 33 of 45\n\n1970, Charles Ridley and others joined the suit, intetVening on behalf of black schoolchildren in \nthe aforementioned districts. \nThe cases were then transferred to the federal judicial districts within which the defendant \nschool districts were located.  On June 7, 1973, the district court for the Northern District of \nGeorgia ordered the parties to show cause why certain school districts, including Troup County, \nshould not be dismissed from the suit.  On July II, 1973,  the United States filed a response to the \norder, arguing that although the school districts had become unitary in the sense required by the \nthen-existing Supreme Court precedent, the districts should not be dismissed from the case and \nshould not be released entirely from court supemsion.  The United States suggested that the \nTroup County case be placed on the inactive docket, be placed under a less detailed permanent \ninjunction (than the 1969 one), and recommended that the injunction automatically expire after \nseven years of substantial compliance.  The United States' response attached a proposed order. \nOn July 23, 1973, a three-judge court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an \norder incorporating almost verbatim the proposed order suggested by the United States, with one \nrelevant exception noted below.  The 1973 Order noted that certain school districts, including \nTroup County, had become \"unitary\"  in the sense required by Brown v.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board ofEducatiol!, 402 U.S. 1,91 S.Ct. \n1267 (1971).  Following the United States' suggestion, the 1973 Order did not dismiss Troup \nCounty from the case.  Rather, the court placed the case on the inactive docket, dissolved the \ndetailed regulatory injunction set into place by the 1969 Order, and substituted a new permanent \n3 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 34 of 45\n\ninjunction, 1 which followed almost verbatim the permanent injunction in the United States' \nproposed order, with one exception.  The proposed order had included a subparagraph (g) \nproviding that the new permanent injunction would automatically expire after seven years of \nsubstantial compliance; however, the 1973 Order did not incorporate that paragraph; it excluded \nentirely the automatic dismi5sal provision suggested by Ihe United States.  Rather, the 1973 Order \nplaced the case on the inactive docket for an indefinite period of time, subject to reactivation upon \napplication of any party.  No party appealed the 1973 Order. \nIn the ensuing years, issues arose as to whether Troup County was meeting its \ndesegregation obligations.  Consequently, in May 1995, the parties reactivated the Troup County \ncase by submitting a consent decree positing a flew desegregation plan.  The district court, per \nJudge Vining, approved and entered the consent decree on May 31, 1995, which imposed various \nobligations on the Troup County School District  The consent decree also provided that if Troup \nCounty would satisfactorily implement the decree's terms for a three-year period, the county \ncould then apply to the court, seeking a declaration of \"unitary status\" and a  from the \ndi~mi5sal \ncase. \nIn August 1996, James and Sandra Godfrey and others (collectively \"Godfrey \nintervenors\") moved to intervene, seeking to modify the 1995 consent decree and ultimately to \nThe 1973 Order imposed upon Troup County certain general obligations prohibiting \nI \ndiscriminatory actions (which might well have imposed upon Troup County nothing more than the \nsame obligation that all school systems have to obey the Constitution and applicable laws), but in \naddition imposed the following obligations upon Troup County:  (1) to maintain a majority-to \nminority transfer plan incorporating free transportation and an obligation to make space available; \n(2) to ensure that all school construction, schc-ol consolidation and site selection (including \nlocation of any temporary classrooms) be done in  manner which will prevent Ihe recurrence of \nII. \ntbe dual school structure; and (3) to pennit transfers either outside the district or into the district \nonly where the cumulative effect thereof will not reduce desegregation in either district. \n4 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 35 of 45\n\nvacate it.  At a hearing before Judge Vining on June 23, 1997, the Gtldfrey intervenors argued \nthat the 1973 Order had conferred a finding of unitary status on the Troup County School \nDistrict, thereby indicating that retention of federal court jurisdiction or supervision was \ninappropriate.  The court thereupon tenninated the hearing and requested briefs on that threshold \nissue raised by the Godfrey intervenors. \nAfter receiving the parties' briefs, the district court issued an order on September 30, \n1997, construing the 1973 Order as a declaration of \"unitary status.\"  Holding that federal court \njurisdiction and supervision thereafter was inappropriate, the court vacated its 1995 Order \napproving the consent decree.  The Order also granted the Gtldfrey intervenors' motion to \nintervene for the limited purpose of allowing them to participate in this appeaL  All other pending \nmotions were dismissed as moot.  Plaintiffs then filed timely notices of appeal.2 \nIII  DISCUSSION \nIn this appeal, Plaintiffs and Troup County urge us to reverse the district court's order of \nSeptember 30, 1997.  They argue that the 1973 Order, though it mentioned the term \"unitary,\" \ndid not constitute a finding that Troup County had achieved \"unitary status.\"  They argue that the \n1973 Order did not dismiss the case, but, quite the contrary, issued a permanent injunction and \nplaced the case on an inactive docket subject to reactivation upon application by any party. \nThe Godfrey intervenors' subsequent motion for summary affinnance of the district \n2 \ncourt's order was denied by this court.  Their motion for expedited appeal, however, was granted. \nPlaintiffs' motion for summary reversal of the district court order is 8tiIl pending before this court, \nand is now denied as moot in light of our disposition of this appeaL \n5 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 36 of 45\n\nFurthennore, they argue that all the parties to this case have for 24 years operated under the \nassumption that they were subject to federal court supervision, relying upon the obvious import of \nthe 1973 Order and also relying upon numerous decisions in this and companion cases (which \nwere also subject to the 1973 Order)  Several of these decisions were previous opinions by the \ndistrict court for the Northern District of Georgia, but one was rendered by the Eleventh Circuit \nitseJt; Georgia State Conference of Branches ofNMCP v. GeorlM, 775 F.2d 1403 (1111> Cir, \n1985).  On the other hand, the Godfrey intervenors argue on appeal that the court below correctly \ninterpreted the 1973 Order. \nWe agree with Plaintiffs and Troup County  It is clear to us that the 1973 Order was not \nintended to be a finding that Troup County had achieved \"unitary status,,,3  It is clear that the \nI 973 Order did not dismiss the case or end federal court jurisdiction or supervision thereof; to the \ncontrary, it imposed upon Troup County a permanent injunction and placed the case on its \ninactive docket, subject to reactivation upon application by any party.  First, we discuss the case \nlaw which sets out the appropriate analysis for the determination as to whether a school district \nhas achieved \"unitary status.\"  Then we set forth the reasoning which leads us to our \ninterpretation of the 1973 Order. \nA.  The Relevant Case Law \nThe appropriate analysis for determining whether or not a school district that has practiced \nde jure segregation has achieved \"unitary status\" is well established by the case law in this circuit \nWe assume ggueruio that the district court's interpretation of the 1973 Order is a finding \n1 \nof fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.  We hold that the district court's \nassessment of the order was clearly erroneous \n6 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 37 of 45\n\nand the Supreme Court.  Drawing upon Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S  467, 112 S.Ct. 1430 (1992), \nand BOard QfEducation of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 236, 1II S.Ct. 630 (1991), this \ncircuit in I&ckett v. Board of Education ofMu§£ogee County, 111 FJd 839 (11\"' eir. 1997), set \nforth the following analysis: \nUtilizing sound discretion after such a careful factual assessment, a district court \nmust detennine (1) whether the local authorities have eliminated the vestiges of \npast discrimination to the extent practicable and (2) whether the local authorities \nhave in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and shown a commitment \nto, the desegregation plan.  Lee v. Etowah County Bd. ofEduc., 963 F.2d 1416, \nm \n1425 (11 Cir. 1992) (citing Dowell, 498 U.S  at 249.50, III S.Ct. at 638) \nIn detennining whether the local authorities have eliminated the vestiges of \nde jure segregation as far as practicable, a district court must examine six facets of \nschool operation:  student assignments, faculty assignments, staff assignments, \ntransportation, extra-curricular activities, and facilities.  In its discretion, a \ndistrict court may consider other facets. \nl!!. at 842.  Upon finding that a school system has achieved \"unitary status,\" the district court \nmust end its supervision ofthe school system and dismiss the case. xg. (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at \n248, 111 S.Ct. at 637, and Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct. at 1445).  Of course, a finding of \n\"unitary status\" and an order dismissing the case, thus ending federal court jurisdiction over and \nsupervision of the school district, would be wholly inconsistent with the continuation of any \nfederal court injunction.  See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491,112 S.Ct. at 1445 (\"A remedy is \njustifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional \nviolation''). \nB.  Interpretation of the 1973 Order \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 38 of 45\n\nWe turn now to the reasons leading to our interpretation of the 1973 Order.  The plain \nlanguage and context of the 1973 Order,  the historical context, and precedent all point \nineluctably to the conclusion that the 1973 Order was not intended to be a finding of \"unitary \nstatus\" and an end to federal court jurisdiction over and supervision of the Troup County School \nDistrict. \n1.  The Plain Language and Context of the 1973 Order \nThe 1973 Order did not dismiss the case, and did nOt end federal court jurisdiction over \nand supervision of the school district.  Quite the contrary. although vacating the more detailed \nearlier injunction, the 1973 Order issued a new permanent injunction, impo3ing certain obligations \non Troup County:  The fact that the 1973 Order imposed this permanent injunction upon Troup \nCounty is wholly inconsistent with an end to federal jurisdiction over and supervision of the \nschool district.  It follows logically that the 1973 Order could not have been intended as a finding \nof \"unitary status.\" \n• We reject the argument of the Godfrey intervenors that the permanent injunction was \nmerely an \"obey the law\"  injunction, imposing upon Troup County ma-ely the same obligations \nthat all school systems have under the Constitution and applicable laws.  Contrary to their \nargument, the instant permanent injunction imposed upon Troup County obligations over and \nabove those that would be owed by a school system which had never practiced de iure \nsegregation or a school system which had achieved \"unitary status.\"  For example, the permanent \ninjunction imposed upon Troup County an obligation to maintain a majority-to-minority transfer \npla.n, and obligated Troup County to make space available for such transfers, and obligated Troup \nCounty to proVide free transportation for such transfers.  A school system which had never \npracticed de jure segregation. or which had achieved \"unitary status,\" would not be subject to \nsuch obligations.  Similarly, the permanent injunction imposed upon Troup County an obligation \nnot to permit transfers either outside the district or inro the district where the cumulative effect \nthereof would be to reduce desegregation in either district.  Again, this is an obligation over and \nabove what is per se required by the Constitution and applicable laws. \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 39 of 45\n\nAs the above discussion of the relevant case law reflects, a crucial finding required in any \ndetermination that a school system has achieved \"unitary status\" is a finding that the vestiges of \npast discrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable.  See eJi., Lockett., 111 F.3d at \n842.  However, the language of the 1973 Order is searched in vain for any mention at all of \nvestiges of discrimination.  The matter simply was not addressed, and therefore the 1973 Order \ncould not have been intended as a finding of \"unitary status.\" \nSimilarly, instead of dismissing the case, as would be appropriate upon a finding of \n\"unitary status\" and an end offederal jurisdiction and supervision, the 1973 Order placed the case \non an inactive docket subject to being reactivated by application of any party.  Again, this feature \nof the 1973 Order is inconsistent with the interpretation urged by the Godfrey intervenors. \nThe context of the 1973 Order also supports our interpretation.  The Show Cause Order \nthat preceded the 1973 Order required the parties to show cause why the case should not be \ndismissed.  In its response, the United States specifically opposed dismissing the case.  Rather, the \nUnited States recommended dissolution of the previously entered detailed injunction and \nsubstitution of a new permanent injunction, the terms of which were set forth in an attached \nproposed order.  The United States also represented in its response that it would monitor the \nschool district's compliance by analyzing the reports to be filed by the school system and \ninvestigating any complaints. \nThe 1973 Order incorporated almost verbatim the proposed order suggested by the United \nStates.  The significance of this context is that, although the Show Cause Order had contemplated \ndismissing the case, the 1973 Order obviously acceded to the government's recommendation that \nthe Ca.'le not be dismissed.  Instead, the Order imposed a new permanent injunction upon Troup \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 40 of 45\n\nCounty and placed the case upon the inactive docket subject to being reactivated upon application \nof any pany.  The 1973 Order departed from the proposed order in only one way which has any \nrelevance to this case.  The proposed order had provided for automatic dismissal of the case after \nseven years of substantial compliance with the new permanent injunction.  The 1973 Order did \nnot incorporate that provision; rather, it left the new permanent injunction in place for an \nindefinite period of time.  Thus, the 1973 Order obviously left the matter of dismissing the case \nuntil a later time (e.g., upon reactivation of the case by any party). \n2. The Historical Context \nIn addition to the plain language and the context ofthe 1973 Order, the historical context \nalso supports our interpretation of the 1973 Order. The Godfrey intervenors rely upon the \nfolJowing language from the 1973 Order: \n[T)he Troup County School District  . [has] for three school years complied with \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board ofEducatioll, 347 U.S. 483 \n(1954), and has become \"unitary\"  in the sense required by the Supreme Court' 5 \ndecisions in Greene (citation omitted] and Swann [citation omitted). \nWe believe that this language, and its use of the term \"unitary\" must be understood in light of the \nmeaning which courts in this circuit, in and around the 1973 time frame, were giving to the term \n\"unitary.\"  The panel in Lee v. Etowah County Board ofEducatioll, 963 F.2d 1416, 1419 n.3 \n(11th Cir. 1992), citing and quoting from Georgia State Conference of Branches ofNMCP v. \nGeorgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1413 n.12 (II th Cir. 1985), aptly described the meaning which courts in \nthis circuit had previously attributed to the term \"unitary,\" and distinguished that earlier meaning \nfrom the meaning of \"unitary status!,l  To summarize, under the terminology prevalent at the time \nIt is useful to recite Note 3 from Lee in full \nl \n10 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 41 of 45\nnr-, I  t  ...... r  n  \\.1  w \n\nof the 1973 Order, a school district was often found to be \"unitary\" merely because it had not \noperated segregated schools as proscribed by Swann for a period of several years  Although \nlabeled \"unitary\" during the 1973 time frame, the school districts involved may still have been \noperating educational systems bearing the vestiges of discrimination and thus were still subject to \nfederal court supervision.  That is, they had not yet achieved \"unitary status.\"  As described above \nand as described in Lee v. Etowah County. \"unitary status\" requires a judicial determination that a \nschool district has implemented a desegregation plan in good faith and that the vestiges of \ndiscrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable\" \nMuch confusion has arisen from the use of the terms \"unitary\"and \"unitary status.\" \nIn Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, \n14)3 n.  12 (11th Cir. 1985), this court defined a \"unitary\" school system as one \nthat \"has not operated segregated schools as proscribed by cases such as Swann \n.(v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 402 U.S. 1,91 S.Ct. 1267,28 L.E.2d \n554 (1971)J .. ' for a period of several years.\"  The court stated that a school \nsystem that \"has achieved unitary status is one which is not ouly unitary but has \neliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimination and has been adjudicated as such \nthrough the proper judicial procedures.\"  Id.  This court later rejected this labeling \nsystem and argued that the term \"unitary\"  should be used \"ouly when referring to \nthe status that a school board must achieve to be freed from district court \njurisdiction.\"  Pitts v. Freeman, 887 F.2d 1438, 1445 n. 7 (11th Cir. 1989), rev'd \non other grounds, 503 U.S  465,112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992) \nTo minimize confusion, we discourage the future use of the term \"unitary\" \nto describe a system that has not eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to \nthe extent practicable but is merely currently in compliance with a court-imposed \ndesegregation plan; nevertheless, we assume for the purposes of this opinion that \nthe district court used the term \"unitary\" at this stage ofthis litigation to convey \njust such a meaning. \nLee, 963 F.2d at 1419 n.3. \nThe Supreme Court has also recognized the different meanings which courts have \n6 \nattached to the term \"unitary.\"  See Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 US. 237, \n245, 111 S.Ct. 630, 635 (1991) (citing Georgia State Coof. and other cases, the Court recognized \nthat \"a school district could be called unitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past \ndiscrimination\") \nII \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 42 of 45\n\nInterpreting the 1973 Order in the context of its time, we believe that the 1973 Order's \nreference to the term \"unitary\" was not meant to embody a finding of \"unitary status,\"  Rather, \nthe mention of the term \"unitary\" in the 1973 Order merely meant that Troup County no longer \nofficially sanctioned a dual school structure7  Not constituting a finding of \"unitary status,\" the \n1973 Order did not end federal court supervision of the case, \nThis historical context undermines the primary argument of the Godfrey intervenors in this \ncase  Based on the mere fact that the 1973 Order used the term \"unitary,\" the Godfrey \nintervenors argue that the 1973 Order must have intended to accomplish all that later courts \nrequired to establish \"unitary status,\"  The historical context explains that the 1973 court meant \nsomething entirely different.  The use of the term \"unitary\" in the 1973 time frame was entirely \nconsistent with the court's failure, so far as the text of the 1973 Order itself or the record in this \ncase indicates, to make any determination as to whether or not the vestiges of discrimination had \nbeen eliminated to the extent practicable,  The 1973 meaning of the term \"unitary\" is also \nconsistent with the fact that the 1973 Order did not dismiss the case, but rather issued a \npermanent injunction and kept the case open on its inactive docket, subject to reactivation upon \napplication of any party,  While these things are consistent with the 1973 meaning of the term \n\"unitary,\" they are of course flatly inconsistent with the achievement of \"unitary status,\" which \nThis belief is reinforced by the similar situations involved in Steele v, Board of Public \n7 \nInstruction of Leon County, 448 F.2d 767 (5th Cir. 1971), and Youngblood v. Board of Public \nInstruction of Bay County, 448 F,2d 770 (5th eir. 1971).  In those two cases, the former Fifth \nCircuit vacated the orders of two district courts which had dismissed two desegregation cases \nafter finding that the school systems were desegregated and \"unitary\" in nature,  The plaintiffs in \nboth cases argued that the cases should not be dismissed, but should instead be placed on the \ninactive docket for the next three school years at which time dismissal after notice and hearing \ncould be considered,  The former Fifth Circuit agreed and remanded the cases with instructions \nfor the district court to reinstate the actions, \n12 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 43 of 45\n('\" l  1(\" T • ...I \n\nwould require a determination that the vestiges of discrimination had been eliminated to the extent \npracticable and would call for dismissal of the case and withdrawal offederal jurisdiction and \nsupervision. \n3. Precedent \nFinally, binding precedent supports  interpretation of the 1973 Order.  The very 1973 \naUf \nOrder at issue in this case was before this Court in Georgia State Conference of Branches of \nNAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403 (I lth Cir. 1985).  That case involved the Coweta County \nSchool District, not the Troup County School District, but the same order was before the Court, \nbecause the 1973 Order governed both the Coweta and Troup County School Districts.  See \nUnited States v. Georgi§, No. 12,972 (ND. Ga. July 23, 1973).  Although this Court noted that \nthe 1973 Order had referred to the Coweta County School District as \"unitary,\" this Court held \nthat the school district had yet to achieve \"unitary status\" and found that the case was not a \nconclUded case.  Georgia State Conference at 1413 ·14 & nn.  11·12.  And although the parties to \nthis case were not parties in the Georgia State Conference case, that panel's conclusion with \nrespect to the posture of United States v. Georgia, No,  12, 972,  is entitled to weight pursuant to \nthe doctrine of stare decisis.  There is no indication that the facts relevant to this Court's \ndiscussion in Georgia State Conference were notably different than the operative facts in the \ninstant record. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n13 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 44 of 45\n\nBased on the foregoing reasons, it is clear that the 1973 Order was not intended as a \nfinding that Troup County had achieved \"unitary status\" as of that time.'  Our interpretation of \nthe 1973 Order is clear from the plain language of the 1973 Order itself which is flatly inconsistent \nwith having been intended as a finding of \"unitary status.\"  Our interpretation is also supported by \nthe historical meaning of the term \"unitary\" in the 1973 time frame, and by precedent. \nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for fill1her \nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \n• Nothing in this opinion should be read as commenting on whether the Troup County \nSchool District has indeed achieved \"unitary status\" since the 1973 Order.  Thus, Troup County is \nin no way prohibited from seeking: a declaration of \"unitary status\" at the earliest possible \njuncture.  OUf holding today confirms only that the 1973 Order does not constitute a finding of \n\"unitary status\" 30 as to make it inappropriate for the district coun to have retained jurisdiction \nand supervision of this case over the intervening years.  Our holding today does not pretermit \nappropriate proceedings in the future, pursuant to Lockett v. Boarel ofEducatigo gfMuscggee \nCounty, I I 1 FJd 839 (lith Cir. 1997), which might cubninate in a finding of \"unitary status.\" \n14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 497   Filed 04/12/99   Page 45 of 45",

Whether  the  trial  judge  correct ly  decided  he  was \nrequired  to  formulate  a  remedy  that  would  actual1y  in \ntegrate  each  of  the  all-black  schools  ill  tbe  northwest \nquadrant  of  Charlotte  immediately,  where  he  found  that \n\n4 \ngovernment  authorities  had  created  black  schools  in  black \nneighborhoods  by  promoting  school  segregation  and  hous \ning  segregation. \n2.  Whether,  where  a  district  court bas  made  meticulous \nfindings  that a  desegregation  plnn  is  practical,  feasible  and \ncomparatively convenient, which  are not found  to  be  clearly \nerroneous,  and  the  plan  will  concededly  establish  a  unitary \nsystem,  and  no  other  acceptable  plan  has  been  formulated \ndespite  lengthy litigation,  the  Court of Appeals  has  discre \ntion  to  set  aside  the  plan  on  the  general  ground  that  it \nimposes  8n  unreasonable  burden  on  the  school  board. \nCODstituaionai  Provisions  Involved \nThis  case  involves  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth  rnendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United \nA \nStates. \nStatement \nI.  Introduction \nPetitioners  are  here  seeking  review  of  an  en  baneS  deci \nsion  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fourth \nCircnit setting aside certain portions of an order of District \nJudge James B.  McMillan of the  'Vestern District of North \nCarolina  which  had  required  the  complete  desegregation \nof the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  County  public  school  system. \nThree members  of the  court,  in  a  plurality  opinion written \nby  Judge  Butzner,  agreed  with  the  lower  court  that  the \nschool  board  had  an  affirmative  duty  to  employ  a  variety \nOne  judge  did  nut  participate.  Prior  to  argument,  Judge \n3 \nCraven  entered  an  order  disqualifying  himself.  He  had  sat  and \ndecided  the  case  as  a  district  judge  when  it  first  came  to  trial  in \n1965  (243  F.  Supp.  667)  and  was  of  the opinion  that  this  previous \nparticipation  harred  him  from  hearing  the  calle  as  a  circuit  judge. \n28  U.S.C.  § 47. \n\n- - - - - - - - ---\n5 \nof  available  methods,  including  busing,  to  disestablish  its \ndual  school  system,  but  thought  that  the  extent  of  busing \nrequired by the district court  to  desegregate  the elementary \nschools  was  unreasonahle  (l84a).  .Judges  Sobeloff  and \nWinter  viewed  Judge  McMillan's  decision  as  appropriate \nand  would  have  affirmed  (201a,  217u).  Judge  Bryan  who \nwould have reversed the entire order expressed  disapproval \nof  busing'  to  achieve  racial  balance  which  he  found  the \norder  to  require  for  junior  and  senior  high  school  students \nas  well  as  elementary. \n2.  Proceeding8  Below \nBlack  parents  and  students  brought  this  action  in  1965 \nto  desegregate  the consolidated  school  district  of  Charlotte \nCity  and  Mecklenburg  County,  North  Carolina  pursuant \nto  28  U.S.C.  1343  and  42  U.S.C.  1983.  The  North \n~  ~ \nCarolina  Teachers  Association,  a  black  professional  or \nganization  intervened  seeking  desegregation  on  behalf  of \nthe black teachers in  the school  system.  This current phase 4 \n• \nThe  case  was  first  tried  in  the  summer  of  1965.  (243  F.  Supp. \n4 \n667  (1965»)  The  plaint.iff:'!  challenged  an  assignment  plan  where \ninitial  assignments  were  made  pursuant  to  geographic  zones  from \nwhich  students  could  transfer  to  schools  of  their  choice.  Plaintiffs \ncomplained  that  mally  of  the  zones  were  gerryma1ldered  and  that \nt.he  zones  of  ten  rural  and  concededly  inferior  black  schools  which \nthe  board  claimed  would  be  abandoned  within  a  year  or  two  over \nlapped  white  school  zones.  They  also  attackr.d  the  free  transfer \npolicy  which  had  resulted  ill  the  transfer  of  every  white  child  ini \ntially  fI.'lsigned  to  black  schools  as  had  the  pl'e\"ious  millorit.y  to \nmajority  transfer  policy.  Underlying  plaintiffs'  specific  grievances \nwas  t.heir  general  assert.ion  that  the  Constitution  required  the \nsc.hool  board  to  take active,  affirmative steps to  illtegrate  the  schools. \nAlso  under  attack  was  the  board's  policy  looking  to  the  \"eventmll\" \nlIon·racial  employmellt and  assigllment  of  teachers. \n'rhe  district  court  approved  the  assignment  plan  but  required \n\"immediate\"  non-racial  faculty  practices. \nThe  court  of  appeals  affirmed.  (369  }<'.2d  29  (1966))  The  deci \nsion  noted  that  the  10  black  schools  had  in  fact  been  closed.  The \ncourt  held,  as  it  did  the  following  year  in  Bowma.n  v.

County  Schaal  Boa,rd  of  New  Kent  COllnty,  3n  U.S.  430 \n(1968),  that  the  school  board  had  no  affirmative  duty  to  disest.ab-\nlish  the dual system.  . \n\n- --- ----\n6 \nof  the  litigation  began  in  1968  when  the  plaintiffs,  relying \nupon  the  Green  trilogy,6  again  sought  the  desegregation \nof  the  schools. \nDistrict  Judge  James  B.  McMillan  first  heard  testimony \nin  March, 1969  and  entered  his  initial  opinion  the  following \nmonth  (300  F.  Supp.  1358;  la)  judging  the  school  system \nto be illegally  segregated and  requiring the  board  to  submit \na  plan  for  desegregation.  Extensive  proceedings  followed \nover  the  next  twelve  He  rejected  the  plan \nfirst \nmonths.~ \nsubmitted  and  called  for  another,  found  the  second  plan \ninadequate  but  accepted  it  as  an  interim  measure  for  the \n1969-70  school  year,  again  required  a  new  plan which  after \nreview  was  also found  unacceptable.7  On  December  1,  1969, \n. \nGreen  v.

Board  of Education,  391  U.S.  443  (1968). \nJudge  McMillan  lIas  provided  an  excellent summary  of  the  pro \n6 \nceedings  in  the  distrirt  court  in  his  Supplemental  Memorandum  of \nMarch  2],  1970  (159a). \nThe  first  plan  was  I'ejected  June  20,  1969  (4Ga).  The  court \n7  011 \nfound  that  the  board  had  sought from  the  staff a  \"minimal\" and  in \nadequate  plan,  that  the  staff  produced  such  a  plan  and  the  board \nthereupon  eliminated  its  only  effective  provisions  before  submitting \nit  to  the  court. \nThe se<:ond  plan  was  fowld  illl'ldequate  on  August 15,  1969  (58a) \nbut.  was  acecpted  for  the  196H-70  school  year  only  because  it prom \n'''as \nised  some  measure  of  desegregation  and  the  court.  felt  there \nnot  sufficient  time  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  new  flcllOOl  term  fol' \nthe  development  and  implementation of  a  more  effective  plan.

The \nII. \nguidelines  promised  no  particular  results  and  were  thus  rejected \non  December  1,  1970  (9311.). \nJudge  Sobeloff  traces  this  history  in  an  extensive  footnote  (21311., \nn.  9).  He  concludes  \"[T]he  above  recital  of  events  demonstrates \nbeyond  doubt  that  this  Board,  through  majority  of  its  members, \nIt \nfar  from  making  'cvery  reasonable effort'  to  fulfill  its const.itutional \nobligation,  resisted  and  delayed  at every turn.\" \nhilS  d~segregation \n\n7 \nfol1owing  the court's  patient but 1l11[lvailing efforts to secure \nfrom the board an acceptable desegregation plant  the failure \nof  the board  to  cIlrry out its minimal  interim  plan  for  1969-\n70  which  bad  heen  \"reluctantly\"  accept.ed  hy  the  Court  in \nAugust  of  1969  and  the  malldate  of  A lexn.'Ilde1·  v.

We  only  summarize  here  some  of  the \nsalient  facts  containetl  in  the  April  opinion. \nDuring  the  1968-69  school  year,  stuuents  were  assigned \ntho \nto  schools  under  the  saillC  plan  as  approved  by  the \ndistrict  court  in  1965  initial  assignments  by  geographic \nzones  with  freedom  of  transfer  restricted  only  by  school \ncapacities. \nThe  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  school  system  serves  more \nthan  84,000  pupils  residing  in  the  city  of  Charlotte  and \nMecklenburg County.  In April, 1969, there were 107 schools, \nincluding  76  elementary  schools  (grades  1-6),  20  junior \nhigh schools  (grades 7- 9)  and 11  senior high schools  (grades \n10-12).  The  system employed  approximately 4,000  teachers \nand  nearly  2,000  other  employees.

The  court  fllrther  founel  that  most  of  the  de \nsegregated cit.y  schools were  in  t.ransitioll  from  a  previously \nall-white  cJJl'ollment  to  all-black.\nH \nThe  school  system  had  heen  growing  at  approximately \n3,000  students  per  year,  requiring  nn  on-going  school  con \nstruction program.  \",Vith  few  exceptions,  the size and  place \nment  of  tIle  recently  constructed  scho01s  produced  either \naU-white  or  all-black  new  schools.

The figllre  is  even \ngreater  if  thc  black 'stndents  attending  schools  which  are  rapidly \nbecoming  all·black  are  included.  11  schools  served  5,502  white \npupils  nnd  no  black  pupils  in  1054,  served  5,010  pupils  of  which \n3fi%  were  black  in  1%5  and  in  1068  served  5,757  student.<;, \n% \n81 \nof  whom  were  black.  The  court  also  fOlmd  that  nearly \n19,000  of  tile  1Il0re  than  3.1,000  white  elementary  students  attended \nschools  w/lich  were  nearly  all-white.

The  great  ma \njority  of  the  900  black  teachers  were  teaching  in  black \nschools.  There  was  less  than  one  white  teacher  per  black \nelementary  school.  The  two  black  high  schools  had  teach \ning  staffs  more  than  90%  black. \nThe  court  concluded  that  the  board's  policies  of  zoning, \nfree  transfer  and  its  school  placement  had  contributed \nto  and  continued  an  unlawfully  segregated  public  school \nsystem.  It  also  concluded  that  the  faculties  had  not  been \ndesegregated  as  required  by  the  1965  order.  The  board \nwas  directed  to  produce  plllns  for  the  active  desegregation \nof  the  pupils  and  faculties  by  May  15,  1969. \nOn  appeal,  Judge  Blltznel'  agreed  that  the  system  was \nunlawfully  segregated  in  April  of  1969: \n\"Notwithstanding  our  1965  approval  of  the  school \nboard's  plan,  the  district court  properly  held  that  the \nboard  was  operating  a  dual  system  of  schools  in  the \nlight of subsequent decisions  of  the Supreme Court . . .\"  \n(184a,  185a-186a}.16 \nThe  district  court  further  found  that  the  impact  of \nsegregation  on  black  students  in  the  system  had  resulted \nin  the  denial of equal  educational  opportunities.  Compara \ntive  test  results  showed  a  wide  disparity  in  achievement \nbetween  students  attending  all-black  schools  and  students \nattending  white  and  integrated  schools  (58a,  65-a-68a,  93a, \n97a-99a,  136a,  144a-145a). \nThe  court  also  found  that  the  residential  segregation \nwas far from benign  or de  facto.  The school board by gerry \nmandering  zone  lines  (53a-54a)  and  other  practices,  to \ngether  with  the  activities  of  othe.r  governlllental  agencies, \nhad  a  sig1lificant  impact  upon  t.he  creation  of  Charlotte's \n_.  om  •• \nBoth  Judges  Sobeloff  and  Winter  concurred  in  this  conclusion \n16 \n(20la,  217a). \n\n13 \nghetto.  Again,  the  throc  circuit  judges  subscribing  to  the \nplurality  opinion  and  .Judges  Soheloff  and  Winter  COll \ncm'red  in  these  findings.  As  Judge  Bubmel'  summarized: \nThe  llistrict.  judge  also  fOllnd  that  residential  pat \nterns  leading  to  segregation  ill  the  resulted  in \nschool~ \npart from  federHl,  state, ancllocal governmental  action. \nThesc  findings  arc  Rupported  by  t.he  evidence  and  we \naccept  them  under  familiar  principles  of  appellate  re \nview.  The  district  judge  pointed  Ollt  that  black  resi \ndences  arc  conccntrated  in  t.he  northwest  quadrant  of \nCharlottc as  a  l'esult  of  both  public  and  privatc  action. \nNorth  Carolina  courts,  in  common  with  many  courts \nelsmdlCre,  enforced  racialrcstl'ictivc  covenants  on  real \npropel't.y  [footnote  omitted]  until  Shelley  v.  Kraemer, \n334  U.S.  1  (1948)  ]wohibited  this  discriminatory  prac \nt.ice.  Presently  the  city zoning  ordinances  differentiate \nbetween  black  and  white  residential  aI·cas.  Zones  for \nblack  arens  permit.  dense  occupancy,  while  most  white \nare  zoned  for  rcstricted  land  usage. \nal'ea~ \nThe  district  j  I so  fonnd  that  rhan  J'enewal  pro \nlldg~  II  11 \njects,  supported  by  heavy  federal  financillg'  and  the \nactive  participation  of  local  government,  contributed \nto  the  city's  racially  segregated  housing patterns.  The \nschool  board,  for  its  part,  located  schools  in  black \nresidential  areas  and  fixed  the  size  of  the  schools  to \naccommodate  the  needs  of  inullediate  neighborhoods. \nPredominantly black  schools  were  thc  inevitable  result \n(186a).17 \nIn  itddition  to  the  activities  of  the  governmental  agencies  pro \n17 \nclucing  the  discriminatory  zoning  (13u,  167a)  and  the  urban  re \nnewal  program  (13a,  lfi7n)  mentioned  by  Judge  Butzller,  there was \nsubstantial  evidence  showing  that  long  rftngc  pla.nning  by  the  City \nCouncil  pl'ojectro  present  segregation  into  Ule  future  (167a),  that \npublic  honsing officials  had  overtly  discriminated  until  recellt.  years \nand  hns  reenforced  rilcial  segregat.ion  by  its  site  selection  (167a.) \nand  that.  those  officin Is  responsible  for  planning  aIHi  building streets \nnnd  highways  have  created  racial  barriers. \n\n-\n. \n14 \n4.  The  Schools  Today \nDuring the  1969-'10  school  year  the  schools  wcre  operated \nunder  desegregation  plan  submitted  to  the  court  in  ,T uly \nH \n1969.  The  plan  provided  for  the  transportation  of  4,245 \ninner-city hlack students to ouUying  white schools.  Of these \nchildren 3,000 were  Lo  come  from  7 schools which  were being \nclosed  lind  1,245  from  overcrowded  hlack  schools.  The plan \nproposed  some  f11l·ther  faculty  llescgregation  but  would \nretain  all  other  racially  discriminatory  of  the \nfcatUl\"CR \nschool  system.  The  board  did  propose,  however,  to  study \nits  bllilding  programs  and  snch  measures  as  altcring  at \ntendance  lines,  pairing,  clustering'  and  other  t.echniques  in \norder  to  develop  a  comprehensive  des(\\gregation  proposal \nfor  the future. \nThe  plaintiffs  objected  to  the  plan  on  the  grotmds  that \nit  left  many  schools  segregated  for  yet  another  year  and \nplaced the full  burden of desegregati.on upon  black children. \nThe court,  in  an  order entered  on  August 15,  1969  (58a), \napproved  the  proposed  pupil  reassignments  for  the  1969-\n70  school  year  \"only  (1)  with  great  reluctance,  (2)  as  a \none  year temporary  arrangement  and  (3)  with  the  distinct \nreservation that 'one-way bussing'  plans  for the  years after \n1969-70  will  not  be  acceptable.\"  The  board  was  ordered \nto  file  a  third  plan  by  November  17,  J969,  \"making  full \nuse  of  zoning,  pairing,  grouping,  clustering,  transportation \nand  other  techniques  . . .  having  in  mind  as  its  goal  for \n1970-71  the  complet.e  desegregation  of  the  entire  system  to \nthe  maxi.mum  extent  possible.\" \n18 \nUpon  application  of  defendants,  the  court  modified  the \nAugl.1flt  15  order  on  August  29  t.o  allow  for  the  reopening \n•  =  _. \nThe  board  explicitly  refused  to  follow  these  directives.  Each \n18 \nof  the  two  plans  submitted  by  the  board  rejected  the  tech \nTI('xt \nniques  of  \"pairing,  grouping  [and]  clustering\".  See  n.  20,  infra. \n\n15 \nof  a  bJack  ilmcr-city  school  to  serve  up  to  600  inner-city \nchildren  who  chose  not  to  be  t.ransported  to  suburban white \nschools  (72a). \nThe  plan  did  not  accomplish  what  was  expected.  The \ncourt  later  found  that  \"the  'performance  gap'  is  wide\" \n(84a) . \nIn  subst.ance,  the  plan  which  was  supposed  to  bring \n4,245  children  into  a  desegregated  situation  had  been \nhandled  or  alIowed  to  dissipate  ib;elf  in  such  a  way \nthat  only  about  one-fonrth  of  the  promised  transfers \nwere  made;  und  as  of  now  [1farch  21,  1970]  only  767 \nblack  children  are  actually  being  transported  to \nsuburban white  schools  instead  of the  4,245  advertised \nwhen  the  plan  was  proposed  by  the  board  (164a). \nIn  the  November,  196!)  :Memorandum  Opinion  the  court \nout  in  detail  the  racial  characteristics  of  the  school \n~et \nf.iystem  during the  1969-70  school  year  (82a,  83a-88a).  The \ncourt  conclnded  that  there  had  been  no  real  improvement \nfrom  the  segregated  ::;ituation  found  during  the  previous \nschool  year. \nOf  the  24,714  Negroes  in  the  schools,  something \nabove  8,500  are  attending  \"white\"  or  schools  not \nreadily  identifiable  by  race.  More  than  16,000,  how \never,  are  obviously  still  in  all-black  or  predominantly \nblack  schools.  The  9,216  in  100%  black  situations  are \nconsiderably  more  than  the  number  of  black  students \nill  Charlotte  in  1954  at  the  time  of  the  first  Brown \ndecision.  The  black  school  problem  has  110t  been \nsolved. \nThe  schools  arc  still  in  major  part  segregated  or \n\"dual\"  rather  than  desegregated  or  \"unitary.\"  (86a). \nAnalyzillg  the  same  figures  in  a  later  order,  the  court \npointed  out  that  \"Nine-tenths  of  the  faculties  are  still \n\n16 \nobviously 'black'  or  'white.'  Over 45,000  of the  59,000  white \nstudents  still  attend  schools  which  are  obviously  white.\" \n(93a,  97a). \nThe  court  also  determined  that  the  free  transfer  provi. \nsion  in  the  board's  plan  negated  any  progress  which  thc \nls \nJuly  plan  might  have  produced. It  also  found  that \nattempts  to  desegregate  the  schools  hy  altering  attendance \nlines  would  continue  to  fail  as  long  as  students  could \nexercise  a  freedom  of  choice  (87a-88a). \nThe court  of  appeals  shared  Judge  :i\\fc:Millan's  view  that \nthe  system  8ti11  segregated  dUl\"ing  the  1969-70  school \nwas \nyear  (188a). \n5.  The  Plan  Ordered  hy  the  District  Court \nIn  the  decision  of  December  1,  1969,  in  which  the  court \nannOlmced  than  an  educational  consultant  would  be  ap· \npointed,  19  principles  were  stated  for  his  guidance  (93a, \n103a-108a).  Dr.  Finger's  instructions  included:  \"all  the \nblack  and  predominantly  black  schools  in  the  system  are \nillegally  segregated  . . .  \"  (106a)  \"efforts  should  be  made \nj \nto  reach  a  71-29  ratio  in  the  various  schools  so  that  there \nwill  be  no  basis  for  contending  that  one  school  is  racially \ndifferent from  the others, but . . .  variations from  that norm \nmay  be  unavoidable\"  (105a)  \"bus  transportation  to  elim \ni \ninate  segregation  [and  the]  results  of  discrimination  may \nThe  court  had  made  similar  findings  in  June; \n19 \nFreedom  of  transfer  increases  rather  than  decreases  segrega \ntion.  The  School  Superintendent  testified  that there  would  be, \nnet,  marc  than  1,200  additional  white  students  going  to  pre \ndominantly  black schools  if freedom  of transfer  were  abolished. \n(51a-52a) \n:Moreo\\'er,  tIll'  choice  period  prior  to  the  1969-70  school \ndUl'ing \nyear,  just  two  white  students  out  of  59,000  elected  to  transfer \nto \nblack  schools  and  only  330  black  students  out  of  24,000  chose  t.o \ntransfer  to  white  schools  (I d.) \n\n17 \nvalidly  be  employed\"  (109a)  and  \"pairing,  grouping, \nj \nclustering,  and  perhaps  other  methods  may  and  will  be \nconsidered  and  used  if  necessary  to  desegregate  the \nschools\"  (107a). \nDr.  Finger's  work  is  described  in  the  Supplemental \nMemorandum  of  :March  21,  1970: \nDr.  Finger  worked  with  the  school  board  staff  mem \nbers  over  a  period  of  two  months.  He  drafted  several \ndifferent  plans.  ,Vhen  it  became  apparent  that  he \ncould  produce  and  would  produce  a  plan  which  would \nmeet  the  requirements  outlined  in  the  court's  order \nof December 1,  1969,  the  school staff members prepared \na  sc1lOol  board  plan  which  would  be  subject  to  the \nlimitations  the  board  had  described  in  its  November \n17,  1969  report.  The  result  was  the  production  of \n~o \ntwo  plans  the  board  plan  and  the  plan  of  the \nC011-\nsultant,  Dr.  Finger. \nThe  detailed  work  on  both  final  plans  was  done  by \nthe  school  board  staff.  (169a) \nBoth  plans  were  present.ed  to  the  COU1't.21 \nHi.q71  Schools  The  school  staff  had  developed  a  plan \nH. \nwhich  produced  a  white  majority  of  at  least  64%  in  each \nThe  board's  two  most.  significant  limiting  factors  were:  (1) \n~o \nRezoning- the  only  mcthod  to  bc  employed;  the  board  rejected \n\\\\'a~ \ntechniques  m;  pairing,  grouping  and  clustering;  (2)  a  school \n~uch \nsought  to  be  desegregated  would  be  at  least  60%  whit.e  thlls,  t.he \ni \nboard's  plan  for  elementary  schools  produced  some  schools  between \n57%  70%  white.  eight  schools  1%  to  17%  white,  two  schools \nfind \n0%  white  and  no  schools  between  18%  find  58%  white  (126a-128a). \nThe  of  found  as  t.he  district  court  had  that  these \ne011l't. \nIlppeal~ \nlimiting  factors  were  improper  (197a·198a). \nDescription  of  the  plans  are  found  in  several  of  the  decisions \n~I \nbelow.  See,  Order,  February  5,  1970  (1138,  119a-121a)  and  tables \n(123a-133a.);  Supplemental  li'indings,  M.arch  21,  1970  (13611.,  146a-\n152a)  ;  Supplemental  Memorandum,  March  21,  1970  (15ga,  169a-\n172a)  Opinion  of  Court of  Appeals  (1848,  1908-191a). \ni \n\n18 \nof  the  ten  high  schools  including  the  presently  all-black \nWest  Charlotte  (sec  Exhibit  B,  123a).  The  board  accom \nplished  this  result  hy  attendance  lines.  Dr. \nrc~tructuring \nFinger's  proposal  used  the  board's  new  zones  and  assigned \nan  additional  300  pupils  from  a  black  residential  area  to \nIndependence  High  School  which  would  have  had  only  23 \nblack  students  under  the  hoard's  plan.  Judge  McMillan \nadopted  the  Finger  modification.  This  portion  of  the  plan \napproved  Judge \nwas  all  appeal.  Blltzner  wrote: \nThe  transportation  of  300  high  school  students  from \nthe  black  resident.ial  area  to  suburban  Independence \nSchool  will  tend  to  stabilize  the  system  by  eliminating \nan  almost  totally  white  school  in  a  zone  to which  other \nwhites  might  move  with  conseqnent  tipping  or  re \nsegregation  of other  schools.  (195a) \nb.  .Iunior High  Schools  During the 1969-70  school  year \nthe  board  operated  19  junior  high  schools.  Five  were  all \nor  predominantly  black;  eight  were  more  than  90%  white. \n(See  Exhibit  D,  124a.)  The  board,  by  rezoning  eliminated \nseveral  of  the  black  schools.  One  school,  however,  Pied \nmont,  remained  90%  black.  Additionally,  four  schools \nwould  be  morc  than  90% \nwhite.~~ \nDr.  Finger  devised  a  plan  which  would  integrate  all  the \njunior  high  schools.  Twenty  of  the  schools  would  have \nwhite  populations  ranging  from  6770  to  79%  and  the  re \nmaining  school  would  be  91 %  white.  The  plan  employed \nrezoning  and  satellite  zones. 23 \n,  = \nTwo  new  junior  high  schools  are  scheduled  to  open  in  the \nn \n1970·71  school  year.  Both  proposed  plans  contemplat.e  assigning \nstudents to  these  new  !;chools_  I t  is  significant  that under  the  board \nplan  one  of  the  Hehools  would  be  100%  white  and  the  other  91 % \nwhite  (124a). \nA  \"satellite  zone\"  is  an  area  which  is  not  contiguous  with  the \n23 \n• \nprImary  zone. \n\n19 \nThe  district  court  approved  of  the  board's  plan  except \nas  to  Piedmont,  and  gave  the  board  four  options:  (1)  re \nzoning  to  eliminate  the  rHcial  identity  of  the  remaining \nblack  school,  (2)  two-way  transportation  of  pupils  between \nPiedmont  and  white  schools,  (3)  closillg  Piedmont,  or  (4) \nadopting  the  Finger  Plall.  The  boa I'd  reluctantly  chose  to \nemploy  the  Finger  Plan. \nJudge  Butzner  found  the  plans  for  junior  and  senior \nhigh  schools  by  use  of  satellite  zones  together  with  trans \nportation  \"a  reasonable  way  of  eliminatillg  all  segregation \nin  these  schools\"  (195a). \nElc'mentary  8c7lOols \nc.  The  board  in  restrl1cturing  at \ntendance  lines  for  the  76  elementary  schools  was  unahle  to \naffect  a  majority  of  the  students  attclHling  racially  identi \nfiable  schools.  the  comt  of  appmtls  observed,  \"Its \nAs \nproposal  left  more  than  half  the  black  elementary  pupils \nin  nine  schools  that  remained  86%  to  100%  black.  and \nassigned  about  half  of  the  white  elementary  pupils  to \nschools  that  are  86%  to  100%  white.\"  (191a;  seo  Exhibit \nH,  126a-128a.) \nThe  Finger  Plan  also  ployed  rezoning:  27  schools \nem \nwere  rezoned,  and  34  schools  were  desegregated  by  group \ning,  pairing  and  transportation  between  zones. 24  .Judge \nMcMillan  described  the  plan: \nLike  the  board  plan,  the  Finger  plan  does  as  much  by \nrezoning  school  attendance  lines  as  call  reasonably  he \naccomplished.  However,  unlike  the  board  plan,  it  docs \nnot  stop  there.  I t   goes  fmther  and  desegregates  all \nthe  rest  of  the  elementary  schools  hy  the  technique  of \nThe  designated  clusters  are  shown  in  Exhibit  .K  (132a-133a). \n~4 \nThe  zones  of  ten  schools  remained  substantially  unchanged. \n\n---\n20 \ngrouping  two  or  three  outlying  Rcbools  with  black \nOlle \ninner  city school;  by  transporting  black  students  from \ngrades  one  through  four  to  the  outlying white  schools; \nand  by  transporting  white  students  from  the  fifth  and \nsixth  grades  from  the  outlying  white  schools  to  the \ninner  city  black  school. \nThe  \"Finger  Plan\"  itself  . . .  was  prepared  by  the \nschool  staff  . . . .   It  represents  the  comhined  thought \nof  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  administrative  staff  as \nto  n  valid  method  for  promptly  dosegregating  the  ele \nmentary  schools  . . .\" .  (150a-151a) \nUnder  the  plan  the  elementary  schools  would  be  from  60% \nto  97%  white  with  most  of  the  schools  about  70%  white. \n(See  Exhibit  J,  129a-131a.) \nJudge  McMillan  found  thc  board  plan  to  be  inadequate \nand  directed  that  the  Finger  Plan  or  some  other  plan \nwhich  would  accomplish  similar  results  be  implemented. \nThe  court  of appeals  agreed  that  the  board  plan  was  un \nacceptable.  \"The  district  court  properly  disapproved  the \nschool  board's  elementary  school  proposal  because  it  left \nabout  one-half  of  both  black  and  white  elementary  pupil\" \nin  schools  that  wel'e  nearly  completely  segregated\"  (197a). \nThe  court  of  appeals,  however,  decided  that  the  extent  of \ntransportation  required  by  the  Finger  Plan  was  unreason \nable  and  directed  further'  proceedings  for  the  development \nof another  plan. \nd.  Transportat-ion  The  district  court's  order  required \nadditional  transportation  to  be  provided.  The  plurality \nopinion  approved  of  the  increments  of  transportation  to \naccomplish  the  junior  and  senior  high  assignments  but \ndetermined that the elementary school husing was excessive. \n\n- - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - -\n21 \nDuring  the  1969-70  Bchool  year,  t.he  board  operated  280 \n• \nHchool  huses  transporting  23,600  of  its  84-,000  students. Z5 \nAnother  5,000  students  rode  public  transportation  at  a  re \nduced  fare.  The  principal's  monthly  bus  reports  show  that \nbetween  10,000 and  11,000 of those  riding school  buses  were \nelementary  students.  The  average  annllal  cost  per  child \nwas  about  $20.00  or nbout  $472,000.00  out  of  a  total  budget \nof  about  57  million  dollars,  almost  all  of  which  was  reim \nhursed  by  the  state. 26  The  buses  average  1.8  trips \nOl1C-way \nper  day  carrying  an  average  of  83.2  students,  averaging \n40.8  miles  (136a, \n138a).~7 \n. \n. \n\" \nJudge  McMillan  made  detailed  and  elaborate  findings  concern \n~5 \ning  the  extent  and  cost  of  busing'  ill  t.he  Char'lotte  system,  the  state \nalld  the  county,  ill  his  Supplemental  Filldings  of  March  21,  Hl70 \n(135a).  (Sec  also  'B\"urt.hel'  Finding'S,  etc.  of  April  3,  1970.)  Thc \ncourt  hnd  examined  the  trallspol'tation  system  in  previous  decisioll!-i \nas  weil  (la,  22a-23a,  40a,  4ilL-48a,  U3a,  1161l-117a). \nSee  Further  Findings,  etc.,  April  3,  1970  (1810-182a).  The \n26 \ndistrict court hnd  originally  understood  t hc  average cost to  be  about \n$40.00  per  pupil  (la,  22a·23a,  1361l,  I38a).  The  state  reimburses \nloe.al  school  boards  for  operating  expenses  for  t.J\"ansportat.ioll  for \nthose  students  who  are  eligible  under  state  law.  The  original  cost \nof  the  bus  is  bOl'lle  by  the  local  board  bnt  the  state  replaces  worn \nout  buses  (181a-1820). \nPupils  eligible  for  trausportation  flrc  those  childrcn  who  live \nY2 \nmore  than  1  miles  frolll  sehool  and  who  live  either  in  the  eount.y \nor  in  portions of  the  city  whieh  have  been  anllcxed  since  1957.  Ad \ndit.ionally,  the  state  pays  the  trllllsportation  costs  for  childrcn  who \nlive  within  the  pre-1957  city  limits  who  attenrl  schools  olltside  of \nthe  pre-1957  limits  (13Gn,  141/l). \nAll  but a  few  hundred  of  t.he  children  to  be  bused  under  the cOl1rt \napproved  plan  would  be  eligible  fol'  transportation  at  state,  rat.her \nthan  local  expeuse  (155a). \nThe  overall  figures  for  the  state  show  a  higher  percentage  of \n27 \nst.udents  riding  buses  than  in  Charlotte.  During  the  ]968-69  school \nto \nyear  about  55%  of  all  students  in  North  Carolina  rode  buses \nschool;  70.9%  were  elementary  students.

The board's February 2 plan proposes  to  bus  approxi \nmately  5,000  additional  students,  about  half  of  whom  are \nelementary pupils.  A  major portion of th.is  busing is within \nthe  City  (155a,  192a).  Moreover,  there  is  nothing  novel \n---\nThese  are the figures  determined  by  the court of appeals  (191a) \n~s \nby  applying  the  diRtrict  court's  Further  Findings,  etc..  of  Apl'il  3, \n1970  (l8Ia)  to its Supplemelltal  Findings of March  21,1970  (I3Ga). \nThe  board  had  claimed  much  greater  increases  in  the  extent  and \nCORt  of  atlditional  but  the  district  rourt,  after  carefully \nbu~ing, \nanalyzing the data, found  the  board's figures  to  be  exaggerated  (see \n\"Discount Factors,\"  136a,  152a-1548).  The court's  findings  are  also \nconsistent  with  the  transportation  requirements  projected  by  the \nboard  for  its  plan  to  transport  3,000  Negro  children  to  the suburbs \nfor  the 1969-70  year.  (See  Report filed  in  summer of  1969,  Volume \nII,  Item 18  of  printed  Appendix  filed  in  Court of  Appeals.) \nObsolete  bl1RCS  are  replaced  by  the  state.  See  note  24, \nsupra. \n~9 \nThe  district  court  observed  that  there  was  at  least  3  million \n30 \ndollars  worth  of vacallt  school  property  which  had  been  abandonrd \npursuant to the 1969-70 desegregation  plan  (157a)  and which,  as the \nboard  had  pointed out in  its  report in  the summer of  1969,  couJd  be \ndisposed  of  to  produce  necessary  \"desegregation\"  funds.

Childrcn  living  in \nthe  city  but  outside  of  the  1957  city  limits  arc  bused. \nMany city boards of education,  such  as  Greensboro,  provide \ntransportation  foJ'  city  children  with  local  funds.  The \npresent  state  superintendent  of  public  instruction,  his  pre \ndecessor  and  the  prestigions 1969 Report  of  the  Governor's \nStudy  Conunission  on  the  Public  School  System  of  North \nCarolina  have  nll  recommended  that  tmIlspol'tation  be  pro \nvided  for  children,  city  as  well  as  rural,  on  an  equnl  basis \n(136a-140a). \nThe  1m!';  trips  required  for  the  pni red  elcmcnta I'Y  schools \nwould  be  stmight-line  110n-stop  trips  (143a),  would  be \nshorter  and  would  take  less  time  than  the  average  bus \ntrip  in  t.he  system  in  the  state  (137a). \n01' \n34.  .  . .  \n(f)  The  average  OJle-way  bus  t!'ip  in  the  system \ntoday  is  over  15  miles  in  length  and  takes  nearly  an \nhour  and  a  quarter.

In  peti \ntioners' view  the  major  questions  presented  are  the  related \nissues  about  the  propel'  formulation  of  Rpccific  desegrega \ntion  gonls  and  the  propel'  standard  for  appellate  review \nof a  decision  on  the  feasibility  of a  desegregation  plan. \nTn  Part  I,  infrn,  we  submit  that  this  record  the  dis \n011 \ntrict  judge  was  correct  in  his  specific  formulation  of  the \ngoal  of  eliminating  each  predominantly  black  and  all-black \nschool.  We  believe  the  court  of  appeals  erred  by  substi \ntuting a  less  concrete  and  complete  goal  requiring \"all  rea \nsonable  means  to  integrate  the  schools\"  but  that  not  every \nschool  \"need  be  integrated.\" \nThe  decision  below  announces  a  legal  rule  of  great  con \nsequence.  The COl11't  below,  by a  narrow vote  (actually three \nmembers  of  the  court), has  explicitly  announced  a  new  rule \nof  law  to  govern  all  school  descgl'egation  cases.  The  new \nlegal  principle  requires  that  in  '€ ar.h  case  a  court  must \ndeeide  whether  the  goal  of  complete  desegregation  of  all \nschools  is  a  rcasonable  goal.  Thus  we  have  not  merely  an \n• \nissue  about the  reasonableness  of methods  of desegregation \nhut  rather  an  issue  about  the  reasonableness  of  the  goal  of \ndesegregation  whethel'  the  court  thinks  desegregation  is \nworthwhile  given  the  circumstances  of  the  district. \nAs  Judge  Sobeloff  has  stated  so  clearly  in  dissent,  the \nrule  portends  serious  conseq nences  for  the  general \nHew \ncourse  of  school  desegregation: \n\n25 \n. . .  Handed  a  ncw  Ii tigablc  issue  the  so-called  rea \nsonableness  of  n  proposed  plan  school  hoards  can  hr \nexpected  to  exploit  it  to  the  hilt.  The  concept  is  highly \nsusceptible  to  delaying  tactics  in  the  courts.  Everyone \ncan  advance  different  opinion  of  what  is  reasonable. \n[J \nThus,  rarely  would  it  be  possible  to  make  expeditious \ndisposition  of  a  board's  elaim  that  its  scgregated  sys \ntem  is  not  \"reasonahly\"  eradicable.  Even  more  per \nlliciollS,  the  new-born  rule  furnishes  a  powerful  incen \ntivc  to  to  perpetuate  and  deepen  the \ncommnl1itie~ \neffects  of  race  separation  so  that,  when  challcnged, \nthey  can  protest that  belated  remcdial  action  would  be \nunduly  (21.2a-213a) \nburdensomc.'~ \nAs  thus  framed,  the  issue  of  appropriate  goals  for  de \nsegregation  pIau  is  one  which  merits  this  Court'!:;  expedi \ntious  attent.iOll.  The  struggle  to  implement  Brown  may \nfounder  the  new  rule  that  segregation  must  be  ended \n011 \nonly  wherc  it.  is  IIJ'casonable\"  to  end  \"black\"  and  \"\",hite\" \nschools.  This  Court's  decision  in  Alexander  v.  Holmes \nCounty  BO(l.rd  of  Education,  396  U.S.  19  (1969),  be  of \nmay \nlittle effect  if a  kind  of reasonableness test on  desegregation \ntiming  is  replaced  by  similar  test  for  deciding  the  goal. \n11 \nIn  Part  II,  infra,  we  urge  that  the  court  of  appeals  ap \nplied  an  inappropriate  standard  for  appellate  review  of \nan  equitahle  remedy  in  setting  aside  the  district  court's \nelementary school  plan as \"unreasonable.\" Where no equally \nexpeditious  and  effective  plan  is  available,  we  think  it  con \ntrary  to  this  Comt's  decisions  for  an  appeals  court  to \nstrike  down  effective  plan  which  has been  reliably found \nall \nto  be  feasible  and  workable.  Morcover,  the  appellate court's \nview  that.  the  remedy  was  too  onerons  was  influenced  by  its \nerroneous  determination  t.hat  it  was  unnecessary  to  inte \ngrate  every  school  in  Charlotte,  as  disclIssed  in  Part 1. \n\n26 \nIn  addition  to  these  clear  legal  issues,  the  case  should \nalso  be  reviewed  because  the  ultimate  decision  in  this  case \nwill  have  enormous  practical impact on  the future  of  public \nschool  desegregation.  The  case  is  singular  in  a  number  of \nrespects.  The  decision  of  the  district  judge  on  February \n5,  1970,  which  has  now  been  set  aside  in  important  part, \ninunediately  assumed  national  significance  and  became  the \nfocus  of  much  public  attention  because  it  promised  the \ncomplete  ueseg-regatiol1  of  every  school  in  an  urban  school \nsystem.  There was  this  pl\"Omise  of  complete  desegregation, \n110twitbstanding  the  complexity  of  a  system  with  106 \nschools  and  mOre  than  84,000  pupils,  the  recalcitranec  of \nthe  10cal1y  elected  school  hoa rd,  and  the  concentration  of \nmost  Negro  residences  in  one  area  where  a  numher  of  all \nblack  schoollS  were  maintained.  Recent  years  have  seen \nconsiderable school desegregation progress in smaller towns \nand  rural  areas  of the  SQuth.  This  is  partly  because  avail \nable  remedies  are  more  obvious  in  small  school  systems. \nBut most  often  Neg)'o  plaintiffs  have been  unable  to  accom \nplish  anything  more  t.han  partial  desegregation  in  urban \nsystems . \n• \nJudge  McMillan's  decision  in  the  Charlotte  case  finds  a \nway  to  break  the  pat.tern  and  integrate  every  school  in \nNo  rt.h  Carolina's  largest  school  district.  The  Fourth  Cir \ncuit's  decision  reversing'  the  plan  for  elementary  school \ndesegregation  blots  out  the  rays  of  hope  that  complete \nschool  desegregation  will  be  acc.omplished  in  urban  schools. \nThe  result  on  this  appeal  clearly  signals  to  every  district \njudge  and  school  board  that  a  cautiolls  \"go-slow\"  approach \nto  using  busing  to  eliminate  aU-black  schools  is  in  order. \nJudge  McMillan's  decisions  signaled  that  substantial  de \nsegregation  can  be  accomplished;  the  reversal  signals  that \nit  will  not  he  aecomplishC'd.  So  the  result  of  the  case  has \nassumed  transcending  importance.  \\Vhat  the  Fourth  Oir \ncllit  did  speaks  as  loudly  as  what  it  said.  What  the  court \n.. \n--\n-\n\n27 \ndid,  of  course,  was  overt.urn  one  of  the  first  desegregation \norders  that  ever  ('eqnired complete  urhan  school  desegrega \ntion  in the  eil'cuit. \nWe  hasten  to  adel,  particularly  in  view  of  our  reqnest \nfor  expedition  and  ollr  f;uggestion  that  smnmary  disposi \ntion  might  be  appropriate,  that  the  case  may  well  be  con \nt.rolled  by  settled  decisions.  Although  the  opinion  below \nraises  the  new  legal  issues  we  have  discusseJ,  they  need \nnot  necessarily  be  decided  in  the  terIlls  in  which  the  court \nof  appeal>;  posed  the  Given  the  findings  of  the \nissl1r~s. \ndistrict.  judge,  which  not  clearly  erroneous,  the  deseg \nal'(.~ \nregation  plan  fot'  Charlotte  nUlY  be  ordered  implemented \nin September without  breaking  any  new  legal  ground.  The \ndistrict  court's  decision  is  supported  by  a  complete  record \nproving  that  the  exist.ing·  school  system  is  unconstitutional \nand  that  a  feasible  remedy  is  at  hand,  The  meticulous \n• \nand  painstaking  decisiOllS  of  the  district  COllrt  are  ample \nsupport  for  a  decision  that  the  plan  should  he  implemented \nas  scheduled. \nI. \nThis  Court's  School  Desegregation  Decisions  Support \nthe District Court's  Holding That  the All-Black  and  Pre \ndominantly  Black  Schools  in  Charlotte  Are  Illegally \nSegregated  and  Should  Be  Reorganized  So  That  No \nPredominantly  Black  Schools  Remain.  The  Court  of \nAppeals  Erred  in  Substituting  a  Less  Specific  Desegre. \ngation  Goal. \nA.  The  Remedial  Goah  Set  by  the  Courts  Below.  \n• \nThis  case  involves  ·whether  it  was  proper,  on  the  record \nand  finding's  macIe,  for  the  district  judg-e  to  require  that \nthe  racially  segregat.ed  dual  system  in  Charlotte-Mecklen \nburg be  thoroughly  reorganized  so  that  each  of  25  remain-\n\n28 \ning  all-black  or  predominantly  black  schools  in  the  system \nwill  be  integrated.  Understanding  of  the  issue  is  aided  if \nwe  analyze  the  particular  facts  of  the  Charlotte  case  as \nwell  as  the  general  legal  principles  which  apply  in  school \nsegregation  cases. \nOn  December  I,  1969,  nearly  five  years  after  this  suit \nwas  filed  by  Negro  plaintiffs  seeking  desegregation,  Dis \ntrict  Judge  McMillan  held  that: \nOn  the  facts  in  this  record  and  with  this  background \nof de  jure  segregation extending full  fifteen  years since \nBrown  I,  this  court is  of the  opinion  that  all  the  black \nand  predominantly  black  schools  in  the  system  are \nillegally  segregated  . . .  (106a). \nThereafter, on  February 5,  1950,  when  a  concrete  plan had \nbeen  designed  by  the  court's  expert consultant  after  work \ning  for  two  months  with  the  local  school  superintendent \nand his  staff, it was  apparent to  Judge McMillan that there \nwas  a  feasible  way  to  eliminate  the  black  schools  he  had \nfound  to  be  illegal.  He  thus  ordered  that  \"no  school  be \noperated  with  an  all-black  or  predominantly  black  student \nbody'!  (116a),  and  the  plan  was  ordered  under  which  the \npercentage  of  black  students  would  vary  in  individual \nschools  from  a  high  of  41%  black  to  a  low  of  3%  black \n(156a).  Thus the district court first  found  the black  schools \nillegal,  and  then  fOUlld  that  their  continuation  was  need \nless  and  that there  was  an available  remedy  for  the  uncon \nstitutional  situation. \nThis  seemingly  straight-forward  sequence  of  events  has \nbeen  nullified  and  the  mandate  of  the  appeals  court  now \nrequires  that  desegregation  planning  for  Charlotte's  76 \nelementary schools begin anew.  Petitioners believe  that the \ncourt  of  appeals  has  not  stated  the  goal  of  desegregation \nplanning  in  suitably  specific  terms  to  satisfy  the  consti-\n\n29 \ntntional  requirement  and  that  the  district  court's  formula \ntion  was  proper,  at  least  for  the  Charlotte-Meeklenburg \nsystem. \nThe  court  of  appeals  rulillg,  in  the  practical  context  of \nthe  case,  requires  that  some  indefinite  number  of  ele \nmentary  pupils  will  remain  in  predominantly  black  and \nperhaps  all-black  schools.  The  opinion  for  three  members \nof  the  court,  by  J ud,ge  Butzner,  states  that  \"not  every \nschool  in  a  unitary  system  need  be  integrated\"  and  that \nwhile  boards  \"must  nse  all  reasonable  means  to  integrate \nthe schools\" sometimes \"black residential  areas are so large \nthat  not  all  schools  can  be  integrated  by  using  reasonable \nmeans\"  (189a).  This  view  acknowledges  that  the  black \nschools are  the  product of illegal  segregation  practices,  but \nsuggests  that the  problem is  essentially  intractable and  that \nthere  is  in  effect  a  wrong  without  a  remedy.  The  wrong  is \nnot  remedied  if  you  diRcount  as  we  do,  the  three  alterna \ntives  to  integrating  the  black  schools  mentioned  by  Judge \nButzner,  c.g.,  providing an integrated  school  for  each  child \nyears,  relying \nin  later  on  the  black  pupils'  usc  of  a  free \ntransfer  right  to  leave  the  hlack  schools,  a.nd  establishing \nspecial  integrated  programs  at  the  all-black  schools.  None  _ \nof  these  suggestions  represents  a  complete  substitute  for \nthe  constitutional  right  to  attend  school  a  system  where \nill \nracial  identification  of  the  schools  has  been  removed  and \nthere  are  \"just  schools.\"  Green  v.

In  previous  opin \nions  the  facts  repecting their  locations,  t.heir  controlled \nsi7.o  and  their  population  havo  already  been  found. \nBriefly  summarized,  these  facts  are  that  the  present \nlocation  of  white  schools  in  wbite  areas  and  of  black \nschools  in  black  areas  is  the  result  of  a  varied  group \nof  clement.s  of  public  and  private  action,  all  deriving \nt.heir  basic  strength  originally  from  public  law  or  stat.e \nor  local  governmcnta 1  action.  These  elements  include \namong  others  the  legal  separat.ion  of  t.he  raees  in \nschools,  school  busses,  public  acconunoclations  and \nhousing;  racial  restrictions  in  deeds  to  land;  zoning \n• \n\n32 \nordinances  city  planning  urban  renewal  location  of \ni  i  i \npublic low  rent housing;  and  the  actions  of  the  present \nSchool  Board  alld  others,  before  and  since  1954,  in \nlocating  and  controlling  the  capacity  of  schools  so \nthat  there  would  usually  be  black  schools  handy  to \nblack  neighborhoods  and  white  schools for  white  neigh \nborhoods.  There  is  so  much  state  action  embedded  in \nand  shaping these  events that the  resulting segregation \nis  not  innocent  or  'de  facto'  and  the  resulting  schools \nare  not  'unitary'  or  desegregated  (166a-167a). \nThe  Fourth  Circlli t.  accepted  these  conclusions  (186a-\n187a),  and also  pointed  out as  one aspect of this,  that North \nCarolina  Courts  had  enforced  racial  restrictive  covenants \non  property  prior  to  Shelley  v.  Kraemer,  334  U.S.  1.  See \ne.g.  Phillil)S  v.  Wea.rn,  226  N.C.  290,  37  S.  E.  2d  895  (1946) \n(involving  property  in  Mecklenburg);  Eason  v.

These  racial \nrestrictive  covenants  enforced  by  injunctions  and  damage \nsuits  were  the  functional  and  practical  equivalent  of  res \nidential  segregation  laws  and  ordinances.a: \nNor  wa.s  the  decision  below  unique  in  recognizing  the  inter \nrelationship  between  school  segregation  and  state  respon \nsibility  for  resideJltial  segregation.

The  District Judge \n(20a; \nwrote  that: \n\"This a.1al'lning  contrast  ill  perfonnance  is  obviously \nnot  knOWll  to  school  patrons  generally. \nI t  was  not  fully  known  to the  court before  he  studied \nthe  evidence  in  the  case. \nIt  can  not  be  cxpla.ined  solely  in  terms  of  cultural, \nracial  family  background  without  honestly  facing \n01' \nthe  impact  of  segregation. \nThe  degree  t.o  which  this  contrast pervades  all  levels \nof academic activit.y  and  accomplishment  in  segregated \nschools  is  relentlessly  demonstrated. \nSegregation  produces  inferior  education,  and  it \nmakes  little  difference  whether  the  school  is  hot  and \ndecrepi t  modern  and  air-conditioned. \n0)' \nI t  is  painfully apparent  that  \"quality education\"  can \nnot  live  in  a  segregated  school;  segregation  itself  is \nf.1I  e greatest  barrier to  quality  education. \nAs  hopeful  relief  against  this  grim  picture  is  the  un \ncontradicted  testimony  of  the  three  or  four  experts \nwho  testified,  some  for  each side,  and  the very interest-\n\n34 \ning  experience  of  the  administrators  of  the  schools  of \nBuffalo,  New  York.  The  experts  and  administrators \naU  agreed  that transferring underprivileged  bla.ck  chil \ndren  from  black  schools  into  schools  with  70ro  or more \nwhite  students  produced  a  dramatic  improvement  in \nthe  rate  of  progress  and  an  increase  in  the  absolute \nperforma.nce  of  the  less  advanced  students,  without \nmaterial  detriment  to  the  whites.  There  was  no  con \ntrary  c\\\"idcllce.  (In  this  system  71%  of  the  students \nare white  and 29%  are  black.)  (67a-68a) \nLegally,  of  coursE>.,  the  ease  does  not  depend  on  any  such \nlocal  findings  of  harm.  \"The  right  of  a  student not  to  be \nsegregated  on  racial  grounds  in  schools  so  maintained  is \nindeed  so  fundamental  and  pervasive that  it is  embraced  in \nthe  eoncept  of  due  process  of  law.\"  Cooper  v.  Aaron,  358 \nU.S.  1,  19  (1958).  But  it.  is  well  to  remember  that  the \nsegregation  system  condemned  by  Brown  is  a  massive  in \ntentional  disadvantaging  of  the  Negro  minority  by  the \nwhite majority.  See Black, \"The Lawfulness of the Segrega \nJ. \ntion  Decisions,\"  69  Yale  L.  421  (1960).  That  disad \nvantage  is  not  dissipated  so  long  as  the  dual  system  is  in \ntact.  The  district  judge  perceived  that  its  elimination  is \nan  urgent  task. \nc. \n0/ \nThe  Decision  Below  Conflicts  With  Applicable  DecuioRs \nThis  Court. \nThe  district  court's  decision  that  each  of  the  predomi \nnantly  black and  all-black schools  in  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nmust be  reorganized  on  an integrated basis  is  in conformity \nwith  this  Court's  decisiolls  defining  the  nature  of  the  duty \nto  desegregate  public  schools  which  was  first  declared  six \nteen  years  ago  in  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education,  347  U.S. \n483  (1954) .  B-rown  II  spoke  of  the  need  \"to  achieve  a \nsystem  of  determining  admission  to  the  public  schools  on \n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n35 \n...... \n,~ \nn  nonracial  basis.\"  Brown v.  Board  of Edw,;aiiMI,  349  U.S. \n294,  300-301  (1955).  In  C001JCr  v.  AMon,  358  U.S.  1,  7 \n(1958),  the  Court  wrote  of  the  duty  of  \"initiating  deseg \nregation  und  bring  about  the  elimination  of  racial  discrim \nination  in  the  public  school  system.\"  Green  County \n\\r. \nSchool  Boa.rd  of  New  Kent  c.o'1l.nty,  391  U.S.  430  (1968), \n\\ \n• \nmade  it  clear  that  Brown  requires  more  than  nondiscrimi \nnatory  admissi01l  of  Negroes  to  \"white\"  Hchools.  Green \nI \nheld  that  Brown  was  addressed  to  the  whole  svstelll  of \n• \nsef,'Tegation  in  which  \"racial  identificat.ion  of  . . .  schools \nwas  complete,  extending  not  just  to  the  composition  of \nstudent  bodies  . . .  but  to  every  facet  of  school  operations \n. . .  \"  (391  U.S.  at  435).  Under  Green.  these  dual  systems \nmust  be  abolished;  the  task  is  the  \"dism3lltlillg  of  well \nentrenched  dual  systems\"  (391  U.S.  at 437),  and \"disestab \nTeen \nlishing state-imposed  segregation\"  (id.  at 439).  The  G \ndecision  states  that  a  \"unitary,  non-racial  system  of  public \neducation was  and  is  the  ultimate  end  to  he  brought  about\" \n(id.  at  436),  that  discrimination  mnst  be  eliminated  \"root \nand  branch\"  (id.  at  438),  alld  that  the  Constitution  re \nquired  \"abolition  of  the  system  of  :;egregatioll  and  its \neffects\"  (id.  at  440).  The  courts  nre  to  render  decrees \nwiII \n\"which  so  far  as  possible  eliminate  t.he  discriminatory \neffects  of  the  past  as  well  as  bar  like  discrimination  in  the \nfuture\"  (id.  at 438,  note  4).  The courts are  to  \"retain  juris \ndicti011  until  it  is  clear  that  state-imposed  segregation  has \nbeen  completely  removed\"  (id.  at  439).  A  call  for  t.he \ncomplete abolition of  racially identifiable schools  is  sounded \nby  the  command  that  the  plan  \"promise  realistically  to \nconvert  promptly  to  a  system  without  a  'white'  school  and \na  'Negro'  school,  but  just  schools\"  (iti.  at  442). \n• \nJudge  McMillan  addl'essed  himself  to  the  most  obvious \nremaining characteristic  of  the  dual  system  in  Charlotte·- \nthe  25  black  schools  whieh  serve  the  bulk  of  the  black \npopUlation.  By the  time  Judge  Mcl'\\'Iillan  rote his  opinion \n·w \n\n36 \non  December  1,  1969,  the  school  board  had  failed  despite \nthree  orders  to  present  a  plan  which  eliminated  the  black \nschools.  Judge  McMillan  perceived  that school  segregation \ncould  not  be  justified  or excused  on  the  basis  of segregated \nneighborhood  patterns  where  the  state  itself  was  respon \nsible  for  Fourteenth  Amendment  purposes  for  the  housing \nsegregation  as  well  as  the  school  segregation.3s  Thus  he \nfaced  the  practical  problem  of fOl\"lllulating  specific  instruc \nand  criteria  for  the  men  preparing  a  desegregation \ntions \nplan.  He  believed  that the concern was  \"primarily not with \nthe  techniques  of  assigning  students  or  controlling  school \npopulations,  but  with  whether  those  technique.s  [let  rid  of \nsegregation  of children in  public  schools.  The  test  is  prag \nmatic,  not  theoretical\"  (61a).  In  order  to  guide  his  court \nappointed  consultant  in  preparing a  plan,  Judge  McMillan \nstated  simple legal guidelines  and criteria.  They are  in  the \nspirit  of  Green  and  are  entirely  unexceptionable: \n2.  Drawing school  zone  lines, like \"freedom of trans \nfer,\"  is  not  an  end  in  itself;  and  a  plan  of  geographic \nzoning  which  perpetuates  discriminatory  segregation \nis  unla\\vful  . . .

There \n• \n\n38 \nis  warrant  in  Green  for  anything  lefls  than  complete \n110 \ndismantling  of  the  dual  sy!;tem.  The  holding  that  racial \nidentifiability  of  need  not be  redressed threatens,  as \n~cboo]s \nJudge  Sobeloff  has  suggested,  to  water  down  temper \n01' \nthe  duty  to  convert  to  a  unitary  system  (2031l).  The  con \nclusion  tbat  the  board  need  accomplish  only  so  much  de \nsegregation  as  seems  \"reasonable\"  poses  a  fundamental \nthreat  to  the  principle  of  Brow'n  I.  As  Judge  Sobeloff \nwrote,  <lissenting,  \"the  conclusion  of  the  majority  that,  all \nthings  considered,  desegregation  of  this  school  system  is \nnot  worth  the price\"  is  a  \"eonclusion  neither  we  nor  school \nboards  are  permitted  to  make\"  (210a). \nThe  district court had  power  under  the  Green decision  to \nrequire  much  more  than  a  minimal  sort of plan.  The  court \nwas  not  bound  to  accept  school  board  proposals  designed \nto  search  out  the  gray  area  between  a  dual  system  and  a \nunitary  system  to  sat.isfy  minimum  desegregation  require \nments.  On  the  contrary, the  court was  empowered  to  strike \nat  the  roots  as  well  as  the  branches  of  the  segregated  sys \ntem.  The court  was  empowered  to  root  out  segregation  so \nthoroughly  that  it  is  unlikely  to  occur  again.  Tho  opinion \nbelow  in part recognizes  this  by  approving the  trial  judge's \nefforts  to  prevent  re-segregation  of  desegTegated  schools \nat  the  high  school  But  the  essential  thl'Ust  of  the \nleveJ.3~ \nIt \ndecision  conflicts  with  this  idea.  seems  clear  that  t.he \nopinion  approves  the  continuation  of  some  majority  black \nschools.  But  experience  in  Charlotte  has  demonstrated  the \ndifficulty  of  maintaining  stable  desegregation  in  majority \nblack  schools.  Frequently  such  schools  fast  become  all \nblack  as  neighborhood  patterns  change  in  an  oft-repeated \npattern  of  white  flight  from  Negro  neighborhoods  and \n• \nThe  court  below  approved  the  trial  judge's  effort  \"to  stabilize \n34 \nthe  system  by  eliminating  an  almost  totally  white  school  in  a  zone \nmight \nto  which  other  whites  move  with  consequent  'tipping'  or \nresegregation  of other schools\"  (195a). \n\n-- - - - - ---\n39 \nschools.  Judge  1\\kMillnn's  pIal}  was  designed  to  cope  wi.th \nthis  problem  by  eliminating  all  racially  identifiable.  schools \nso  that  this  factor  would  no  longer  play  a  part  in  the \ncommunity. \nThe  COUl\"t  of  appeals'  goal  of  obtaining  as  much  integra \ntion as is  in  the  jurisdiction  must  leave  every \n\"reasonabll~\" \nboard  court  which  :;eeks  to  apply  the  formula  essen \n01' \ntially  at sea.  The  standard of  reasonableness  was  adopted, \n. says  the  court,  because  \"sollie  cities  . . .  have  black  ghettos \nso  larg'(!  that  integration  of  evel'y  school  is  an  improbable, \nif  not  unattainable,  goal.\"  But,  of  course,  the  Finger  plan \ndemonstrates  that  this  goal  is  not  unattainable  in  Char \nlotte-Mecklenburg.  And  Uhal'lotte-l\\{ecklenburg,  the largest \nsehool  system  in  North  Carolina,  is  fairly  representative \nof  the  desegregation  problem  in  the  cities  of  the  Fourth \nCircuit.  The  United  States  Commission  on  Civil  Rights \nhad  recently  made  the  same  point: \nIt \nis  a  mistake  to  think  of  the  problems  of  deseg \nregation  and  the  extent  that  busing  is  requjred  to \nfacilitate  it  solely  ill  the  context  of  the  Nation's  rela \ntively  few  giant  lll'bau  centers  such  as  Chicago,  New \nIn \nYork,  Los  Angeles.  most  of  our  cities  the  tech \n01' \nniques  necessary  to  accomplish  desegregation  are  rela \nti vely  simple and creates no  hardships.  The experience \nin  communities  which  have  successfully  desegregated \ncould  easily  be  transferred  to  cities  of  greater  siz.e. \n(Statement  of  the  United  States  Commission  on  Civil \nR.ights  Concerning  the  \"Statement  by  the  Presidellt \nElementary  and  Secondary  School  Desegregation\", \nOIl \nApril  12,  1970.) \nJudge  Butzner's  decision  suggests  that  complete  deseg \nregation  be  obtained  only  in  \"towns,  small  cities,  and \nCall \nrural  by  the  available  techniqnes.

In  part \nII  which  follows we  shall  discuss  the  evidence  about  the \n7 \nworkability  of  this  pIau. \n1][. \nThe Court  Below  Erred  in Not  Accepting  the  District \nCourt's  Decision  That  Its  Desegregation  Plan  Was  Fea. \nsible  and  in  Setting  It  Aside  as  \"Unreasonable,\"  Par \nticularly  in  the  Absence  of  Any  Equally  E:IIective  and \nExpeditious  Alternate Plan. \nThe  district  judge  in  this  case  faced  an  acute  practical \nprohlem  in  formulating  a  remedy  to  redress  the  violations \nof  the  Constitutional  rights  of black children  in  the  Char \nlotte-Mecklenburg  system.  The  system  is  large  with  84,542 \npupils  in  106  schools.  School  segregation  is  still  extensive \nwith  more  than  three-fourths of  the  children  still  in  racially \nidcntifiable  \"white\"  schools  Or  \"black\"  schools.  Some of  the \nintegrated  schools  have  rapidly  moved  through  a  tempo \nrary  integration  to  an  all-black  J·e-segregated  situation. \nThe  free  transfer  plan  was  a  conspicuous  failure.  To  make \nmatters  worse,  the  sehool  board  refused  to  accept  its  duty \nof  preparing  an  adequate  plan.  The  board  attacked  the \njudge's  llecisions  in  public  fornms  and  the  state legislature \nenacted  an  anti-busing  law  to  nullify  his  decisions.  The \nboard  did  not  even  deli vel\"  all  desegregation  promises  in \nits  interim  plan  for  1969-70.  In  the  summer  of  1969  the \nblack  community had  protested  \"one-way\"  desegregation in \nthe  interim  plan  by  which  only  hlack  pupils  were  bused  to \nwhite  schools  and  formerly  black  schools  were  abandoned. \n-\n·White  parel1ts  groups  were  aroused  against  \"busing\"  by \ntelevised  school  board  meetings  decrying  the  destruction \n\n- - - - - -\n- - - - -\n41 \nof  \"11eighborhood  schools.\"  Against  this  background  in \nOctober  1969,  the  board  requested  a  delay  in  filing  deseg \n11 \nregation  plan.  judg'e  regretfully  concluded: \nT~le \nThe  school  hoard  is  sharply divided  in  the  expressed \nview  of  its  members.  From  the  testimony  of  its  mem \nbers,  and  from  the latest  report,  it cannot  be  concluded \nthat  a  majority  of  its  members  have  accepted  the \ncourt's  orders  as  representing  the  law  which  applies \nto  the  local  schools.  By the  responses  to  the  October  10 \nqnestions,  the  Board has  indicated  that  its  members do \nnot  accept  the  duty  to  desegregate  the  schools  at  any \nascertainable  time;  and  they  have  clearly  indicated \nthat  they  inteml  no/.  to  do  it  effective  in  the  fall  of \n1970.  They  have  also  demollst,'ated  a  yawniIlg  gap \nbetween  predictions  and  performance.\"  (90a-91a) \nJudge  :McMillan  had  no  choice  but  to  deny  the  request.ed \ndelay  in  view  of  this  Court's  then  recent  decision  in  Alear \nander  v.  H olm.es  ComIty  Boa.rd  of  Educaf.ion,  396  U.S.  19 \n(October 29,  1969).  The school  board  then  filed  a  third plan \nwhich  the  court  later  held  \"contaills  no  promise  or  likeli \nhood  of  desegregating  the  schools\"  (93a). \nThe  singular  thing  about  this  case  is  that  faced  with  this \npanoply  of  ohstacles  and  difficulties,  the  district  judge \n• \npromptly  found  a  meallS  to  completely  integrate  every \nschool.  He  adopted  the  reasonable  procedure  of:  (1)  writ \ning  detailed  legal  guidelines  for  the  pJ'eparation  of  a  de \nsegregation  plan,  (2)  appointing  t.he  court's  own  expert \nconsultant  to  devise  a  plan,  and  (3)  ordering  the  profes \nsional  staff  of  the  Charlotte  school  system  to  work  with \nss \nt.he  court's  expert  and  give  him  full  cooperation. The \n-\nThe  board  was  ordered  to  provide  the  consultant  with  work \n3& \nspace,  pay  his  fees  and  expenses,  give  him  stenographic  assistance, \nthe  help  of  business  machines,  draftsmen,  and  computers,  as  well  as \n\n42 \nprocedure  worked.  By Fehruary 5,  1970,  about  two  months \nafter  the  appointment,  the  court.  was  able  to  ap \nexpert'~ \nprove  the  plan.  Over plaintiffs' objection, and  at the board's \nrequest,  implementation  was  postponed  until  later  in  the \nspring  to  enable  the  board  to  make  further  preparation. 3\n• \nThe  decision  of  the  court  of  appeals  approved  the  plan \nfor  junior  and  senior  high  schools  rejecting  the  school \nboard's  appeal  in  this  regard.  But  the  elementary  school \nplan  was  struck  dO'''Jl  because  three  judges  of  the  court \nbelow  held  it  not  \"reasonable,\"  and  a  fourth  judge \nwa~ \nthought the  plan  undertakes the  illegal  objective  of \"achiev \ning  racial  balance\"  by  busing·  pn pil s. \nTo  summarize  petitioners'  position  briefly,  we  think  the \ngrollnd for  disapproving the elementary  plan  ·that the bus-\n-\nOF  •  \" \nRccesS  to  all  the  board's  stud ies,  including  computer  studies,  of \ndesegregation  plans.

The  Fourth  Circuit approved  this  procedure  citing .Justice \nBrandeis'  opinion  In  the  Matta  ot  Peierson,  253  U.S.  300  (1920). \nSee  Iso,  Scott  v.

If a  court  has  the  equity  power  to  award  plaintiffs \ncounsel  fees  against  a.  foot-dragging  school  board  (Bell  v.  School \nBoard  of  Powhatan  County,  Va.,  321  F.2d  494  (4th  Cir.  1963)), \na tm·tinri,  the  court  can  take  the  milder  course  of  taxing costs  nec \nessm·y  to  enable  the  judge  to  frame  his  decree.  This  is  all  the  more \nIIppropriate  because  tIle  ease  plainly  involves  the  public  interest. \n80 \nAfter  the  court  of  ,;tayed  part  of  the  plan  pending \n36  appeal~ \nappeal,  the  district  judge  <.:oneluded  that  the  integration  require \nment  waf;  no  longer  so  urgent  and  postponed  the  entire  plan  until \nSeptember 1970.  Petitioners  unsuccessfully  opposed  each  delay  and \ncross-appealed  the  delay  order.

The  arguments \nabout  illegal  busing t.o  achieve  racial  balance  and  t.he  neigh \nlJOl'hood  school  theory  are  also  legally  insubstantia.l. \nThe  dist.rict court acted  within  the  limits  of its  discretion \nin  fashioning  an  equit.able  n:!Olcdy  for  the  prosent  uncon \nstitutional  system.

It will  prod I1ce  a  system wi thout  a  single  school \nwhich  might be labeled  a  \"white\"  school  or a  \"black\"  school. \nThe  elimination  of  racially  identifiable  schools  promised  by \nthis  plan  produces  the  result  called  for  by  Green,  supra. \nI f  there  was  some  proposal  in  the  record  which  would  be \nequally  effective  o·r  'I'll-ore  effective  in  eliminating  segrega \ntion,  there  would  be  room  discussion  about  which  plan \nfOI' \nis  most  desirable.  Bnt,  .Tndge  Mc:Millnn  demonstrated  that \nhe  was  prepared  to  aceept  school  board  alternatives  which \nproduced  equnl  results  in  accomplishing  desegregation.  He \npreferred  such  \"home-growl]  products\"  even  where  he  be \n, \nlieved  the  expert COTISllltnllt's  proposals  wore  more  efficient. \nBut an  essential finding which  supports  the  Fingel' Plan for \nelementary  schools  is  .Judge  Ivlcl\\1illan's  cOllclllSiOlI  that  it \n\n44 \nwas  necessary  to  adopt  a  plan  of  this  type  to  accomplish \nthe  result  of  desegregation.  The  court  found: \nBoth  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  board  staff  appear \nto  have  agreed,  and  the  court  finds  as  a  fact,  that  for \nthe  present  at  least,  there  is  no  way  to  desegregate \nthe  all-black  schools  in  Northwest  Charlotte  without \nproviding  (or  continuing  to  provide)  bus  or  other \ntransportation  for  thousands  of  children.  All  plans \nand  all  variations  of  plans considered  for  this  purpose \nlead  in  one  fashion  or  another  to  that  conclusion. \n(146a) \nJudge  Sobeloff's  dissenting  opinion,  noted  that  \"The \npoint has  been  perceived by  the  counsel  for  the  board,  who \nhave  candidly  informed  us  that  if  the  job  must  be  done \nthen  the  Finger  plan  is  the  way  to  do  it\"  (204). \nThe  elementary  plan  ought  to  be  upheld  if  the  case  is \ngoverned  by  the  traditional  rrue  for  appellate  review  of  a \nchancellor's  decree  in  equity.  The  prevailing  rule  is  that \nequitable  discretion  in  framing  remedies  is  necessarily \nbroad  and  that  a  strong  showing  of  abuse  of  discretion \nmust  be  made  to  reverse  such  a  decree.

In order  to \nj \nset aside the equity decree  the appellant \"must demonstrate \nthat  there  was  no  reasonable  basis  for  the  district  judge's \ndecision,\"  and  thus  that  the  remedy  is  so  lacking  in  ra \ntionality  as  to  amount  to  an  abuse  of  discretion.  United \nStates  v.  W.  T.  Grant  Co.,  supra,  345  U.S.  at  634. \nThis  Court's  decisions  in  school  cases  have  relied  on \ntraditional  equitable  principles  on  remedial  issues.  In  the \nsecond  Brown  decision  the  Court  invoked  the  tradition  of \n\n- - _ . _ -\n- ._._--_.  - --\n• \n45 \nequity  which  was  said  to  be  \"characterized  by  a  practical \nflexibility  in  shaping  its  remedies  by  a  facility  for \nalld \nreconciling  public  and  private  needs\"  (349  U.S.  at  300). \nThe  Brole1l  II  Court.  cited  with  approval  a  passage  in \nA.lexander  v.  Hillman,  296  U.S.  222,  239  (1935),  stating. \nTreating  thei r  est.ablished  forms  as  flexible,  courts  of \nequity  ruuy  suit  proceedings  and  remedies  to  the  cir \ncumstances  of cases  and  formulate  them  appropriately \nto  safeguard,  cOll\\'eniently  to  adjudge  and  properly  to \nenforce  subst311tial  rights  of  all  the  parties  before \nthem. \nL \nIn  Griffin.  v.

Green  v.  County  School.  Board,  391  U.S. \n430,  439  (1968),  emphasized  that  in  formulating  a  remedy \n• \ndistrict courts were to  assess \"the circlImstances  present and \nthe  options  available  ill  each  instance.\"  In  United  States  v. \nMO'lltgo'lllery  County  Boa.rd  of  Education,  395  U.S.  225, \n235  (1969),  the  Court  emphasized  that  \"in  this  field  the \nway  mnst  always  be  left  open  for  experimentation.\"  In \nthe  Montgomery  County  case  the  Court  reversed  a  court \nof appeals  decision  which  labeled  the  district  judge's  order \ntoo  rigid  and  inflexible  in  favor  of  the  trial  court's  \"more \nspecific  and  expeditious  order.\"  Finally,  in  decisions  this \nterm  the  Court  has  limited  the  discretion  of  the  courts \nto  delay  relie.f  by  making  it  plain  that  the  \"standard  of \nallowing  'all  deliberate  speed'  for  desegregation  is  no \nlonger  constitutionally  permissible.\"  .A lexan.der  v.

Public  OklaJwnw \n396  U.S.  269  (1969). \n\n4G \nThere is nothing' in  this development of school desegrega \ntion  Jaw  since  Brown  which  warrants  the  departure  from \nthe  traditional  rule  of  appellate  review  announced  by  the \nplurality  opinion  of  Judge  Butzner  for  the  court  below. \nThis  new  test  of  \"reasonableness enables  the  reviewing \nlt \ncourt to  ::;ct  aside  the  trial  court's  discretion  on  the  ground \nthat  the  appeals  court  majority  would  pl'efer  another \nmode  of  relief  albeit  less  effective.  This  runs  exactly \nconnter  to  the  spirit  of  Green  which  declares  that  the \nresult  -actnal  desegregation  is  the  imperative  thing  and \nthat  the  methodology  of  desegregation  plans  is  secondary. \nIt  also  runs  counter  to  the  philosophy  of  Alexander, \nGarter  and  Dowell;  supm,  which  place  a  premium  on  the \nimmediate  implementation  of  constitutional  rights  pending \nthe completion of litigation.  The  reasonableness  test allows \nso  much  scope  for  unpredictable  reversals  of  those  decrees \nwhich  accomplish  actual  desegregation  as  to  substantially \nnullify  Alexander.  The  reasonableness  test  signals  the \nneed  for  trial  courts  to  adopt  a  \"go-slow\"  cautious  ap \nproach.  Althougb  busing  is  approved  in  principle  in  the \nopinion  below,  the  result makes  it clear that busing must be \nlimited.  The  standard  of  \"reasonableness\"  is  broad  and \nvague,  but it does  not allow broad discretion  for  trial courts \nto  order  busing-.  Any  plan  found  objectionable  by  a  school \nboard c.a.n  colorably be  said to  be  \"unreasonable\"  justifying \nat  least  a  stay  pending  appeal  The  \"reasonableness\"  test \nis  \"deliberate  speed\"  in  a  new  guise. \nThe  district  court's  decision  t.hat  the  Finger  Plan  is \nfeasible  is  in any  event  supported  by  substantial  evidence. \nI t  was  error  for  the  court  of  appeals  to  substitute  its  own \nfinding  of  \"unreasonableness\"  where  there  was  no  claim \nthat  the  district  c.onrt's  findings  were  clearly  erroneous. \nOf.  Northcross  v.  Board  of  Education,  397  U.S.  232,  235 \n(1970)  As  Judge.  Sobeloff  has  shown,  ill  dissent,  \"there \nis  no  genuine  dispute\"  on  the  feasibility  of  the  plan;  it  is \n\"simple  and  quite  efficient\"  (206a).  Here  are  the  facts. \n, \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n47 \nThe  Finger  Plan  requires  transportation  of  pupils  to \naccomplish  desegregation.  The  system  now  transports \n23,600  pupils  by  school  bus  and  another  5,000  by  common \ncarrier. 37  The  school  boa rd's  proposed  plan  would  bus \nabout  5,000  additional  children 38  but  still  would  not \ndesegregate  the  system,  leaving  10  Negro  schools. 39  The \nboard's  plan  by  busing  about  8,000  more  children  than  the \nboard's  proposal  (a  total  of  about  13,000  more  than  at \npresent)40  will  eliminate  racial  identifiability  from  every \nschool  in  the  system.  The  court  of  appeals  affirmed  the \norder  as  to  secondary  students  (1,500  senior  high  and \n2,500  jll1lior  high  pupils),  but  reversed  the  requirement \nto \nas  elementary  pupils  (9,300  pupils,  including  1,300  in \nschools  to  be  simply  rezoned,  and  8,000  involved  in  cross \nbusing  between  paired  schools). \nH \nTho  court  carefully  considered  the  busing  from  the \nstandpoint  of  the  children.  The  crucial  finding  is  this: \nThe  comt  finds  that  from  the  standpoint  of  distance \ntravelled, time en  route and  inconvenience,  the children \n\" \nhussed  Pllrsuant  to  the  court order will  not  as  a  group \ntravel  as  far,  nor  will  they  experience  more  incon \nvenienco  t.han  the  more  than  28,000  children  who  are \nat \nalready  being  t.ransported  state  expense.

In  this  plan  Piedmont  .Junior  High  would  be  90% \nblack  and  sh ifting  toward  100%  black;  segregation  would  actually \n% \nillcrea!>e  by  1  more  black  pupils  (124a). \n40 \nSee  157a. \nIbid. \n41 \nSee  142a,  153a. \n4~ \n\n48 \nhour  for  a  onc-way  trip  now. 49  The  average  one-way  trip \nunder  the  court  plan  \"for  elementary  students  is  less  than \nseven  miles,  and  would  appear  to  require  not  over  35 \nminutes  at most, because no  stops  will  be  necessary between \nschools.\"H \nJudge  Blltzllcr's  opinion  approves  \"bussing  [as]  a  per \nmissible  tool  for  achieving  integration,  but . . .  not  a  pan \nHe \nacea.\"  wrote  that  in  deciding on  busing  boards  \"should \ntake  into  considenttion  the  age  of  the  pupils,  the  distance \nand  time  req uired  for  transportation,  the  effect  on  traffic, \nand  the  cost  in  relation  to  the  board's  resources.\"  This \nruling  is  enlightened  and  progressive  as  used  to  approve \nhusing  plans  for  secondary  schools.  But  it  fails  to  satisfy \nconstitutional  requirements,  if  it  means,  as  it  apparently \ndoes,  that  theRe  factors  are  to  be  weighed  in  determining \nwhether  schools  will  he  integrated  at  all.  There  is  no  sug \ngestion  in  the  opinion  that  the  majority  found  the  Finger \nplan  wanting  in  terms  of  the  \"age  of  the  pupils\",  since \nbusing elementary  pupils  is  an  established  tradition  in  this \nsystem.  There  was  no  suggestion  that  the  times  and  dis \ntances  involved  were  excessive  since  they plainly compared \nfavorably  with  the  present  practice.  The  deterIllination  to \nreverse  the  elementary  plan  is  put  entirely  on  the  cost \nfactor. \nTo  begin  with,  the  court  below  states  the  cost  issue  not \nin  dollar  terms,  but  in  terms  of  the  increased  percentage \nof  busing.  Thus  the  cost  is  not  considered  in  terms  of  its \nIIrelation  to  the  board's  resources\"  but  only  in  relation  to \npresent  expenditures  for  busing.  Even  on  this  basis  the \nplan  will  require  less  husing  in  Charlotte  than  the  state \nwide  average  of  54.9%  of  the  pupils  (137a).  But  the \n- . \n, \nSee  142a. \n48 \nSef'  153a,  \"The  a\\'eragf'  Une  mileage  between  the \n.~Iraight \n44 \nelementary  schools  paired  or  grounded  under  the  'cross·bussing' \nplan  is  approximately  5%  miles,\"  (183!!.)  The  trip  mileage  was \narrived  at  by  the  bus  superintendent's  method  of  taking  straight \nline mileage and adding 25%. \n\n.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n49 \n\"board's  resources\"  in  this  context  are  much  broader  than \nthe  local  funds  hecause  in  North  Carolina  transportation \ncosts  are  largely  met  by  the  State,  which  replaces  all  buses \nafter the local authorities make  the first purchase,  and bears \nmost  of  the  operating  costs.  The  total  annual  cost  per \npupil  is  about  $20  in  the  system.  (Note  that  the  $39.92 \nfigure  mentioned  several  times  in  Opillions  is  elToneons \nand  is  corrected  to  $20  at 181a-182a.)  Virtually  the  entire \ncost is  bome by  the  State,  except for  one-time  hus  purchase \ncosts  and  incident.al  administrative  costs  and  parking  ex \npenses.  The  capital  out.lay  required  for  the  elementary \nhusing  is  $5,400  per  bus  for  90  vehicles,  or  $486,000.  This \ninvestment.  will  bring  not.  only  vehicles  with  useful  lives  of \nt.en  or  more  years  hut  also  the  right  to  have  them  per-\n• \npetnally replaced  at no  fn rther local cost by  the  state  board \nof education.  Operational  costs  (reimhursed  hy  the  State) \nfor  the  added  elementary  busing  were  found  to  be  $186,000 \nannually  (191a,  181a-182a). \n\"\"\"'hen  these  expenditures  are  considered  in  the  context \nof  the  local  budget  fignres  and  the  state  hlldget  figures \nthey are  so  small  as  to  he  insignificant.  The  1969-70  budget \nfor  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  is  $57,711,344,  and  future  years \nmay bring even  larger expenditures.  Between  six  and  seven \nmillion  dollars  represents  capital  outlay  and  debt  service. \nSchool  constrnction  is  not  included  in  these  figures.  In \n1968-69  the  state's  education  hudget  was  over  3.59  billion \nclollal's  and  this  included  over  $14  million  spent  on  trans \nportation fol'  an  average  of 610,760  pupils  daily.  Given this \nfinancial  framework,  the  decision  below  that  there  is  a \nfinancial  barrier  to  integrating  the  local  school  system \ncannot  be  sustained.  The  appropriate  principle  was  stated \nin  Cooper  v.  Aaron,  358  U.S.  1,  19,  where  a  unanimous \ncourt  declared  that: \n• \nState  support  of  segregated  schools  through  any  ar-\nrangement,  management,  funds  or  property  cannot  be \n\n50 \nsquared  with  the  Amendment's  command  that  no  state \nshall  deny  to  any  pcrson  within  its  jurisdiction  the \nequal  protection  of  the  laws. \nWe  livc  in  a  society  where  it  is  a  commonplace  for  gov \nernment  to  spend  vast  sums  to  protect  the  constitutional \nrights  of  our  ci tizens.  N ew  York  City  in  recent  weeks  is \nreported  to  have spent a  million  dollars  for  overtime police \nprotections  for  pro- and  anti·wa r  demonstrators  in  the \nstreets.  Examples  could  be  proliferated.  The  rights  of \nblack  childl'en  to  an  equal  educational  opportunity  cannot \nbe  sacrificed  on  the  ground  that it costs  too  much  to  grant \nequal  treatment.  I f  lleceRsary,  the  federal  courts  may  even \ncommand  that  the  money  be  levied  and  spent  to  redress \ndenial  of constitutional  rights.  Griffin  v.  School  Board,  377 \nU.S.  218  (1964).  But  this  case  involves  merely  a  decision \nabout  how  existing  resonrces  are  allocated.  As  a  matter \nof  fact,  at  the  time  of  the  judge's  supplemental  findings \nof  :March  21,  1969,  the  state  hoard  of  tion  (a  defen-\n• \ndflnt  in  this  case)  had  \"approximately  rand  ne\\'\"  school \nbusses :md 375  used  busses  in  storage, awaiting orders from \nschool  boa  (157 a).  \"Thc  problem  is  not  one  of  avail \nrds~' \nability  of  busses  hut  of  unwillingness  of  Mecklenburg  to \nbuy them  and of the  state to furnish  or make  them  available \nuntil final  decision  of  this  case\"  (157a-158a). \nJudge  Sobeloff  found  the  majority's  conclusion  with  re \nspect  to  the  elementary  plan  so  inconsistent  with  the  deci \nsion  approving  the  use  of  busing,  satellite  zoning,  and \nsimilar  techniques  for  secondary  students  that  he  said  the \n\"deci sion  totally  ba mes  me\"  (211a).  The  major  distinction \nbetween  the  busillg  which  is  approved  and  that  which  is \nrejected  is  that  the  secondary  plans  primarily  increased \nbusing  of  black  students  to  formerly  white  schools  while \nthe  elementary  plan  requires  busing  of  white  children  as \nwell  as  Negroes.  We  are  unlikely  to  ever  end  the  dual \n\n• \n51 \nf'!chool  systems  until  it  hecomes  accepted  that  the  incon \nveniences  incident  to  reorganizations  of  the  school  systems \nwill  not  be  borne  by  hlack  pupils  alone  but  will  be  shared \nhy  the  white  community,  Equal  protection  docs  require \nthat  desegregation  plans  be  generally  equitable:  and  not \nplace  the  entire  burden  on  l,lacks,  Judge  Mdlfillall  an \nnounced  at  the  time  he  approved  the  interim  plan  for \n]969-70 that he would  not again  appl'ove  plan for  one-way \nIt \nbusing  (69a-70a),  He  wrote  tha t: \nIf,  as  the  school  superintendent  testified,  none  of  the \nmodern,  faculty-integrated,  expensive,  \"equal\"  black \nschools  in  the  system  a1'e  suitable  for  desegregation \nnow,  steps  can  and  should  be  taken  to  elumge  that con \nditioll  before  the  fall  of  1970,  Unsuitabilit.v  inade-\n0\\' \n• \nquacy  of  a  1970  \"black\"  school  to  educate  1970  white \nwill \npupils  not  be  c01lsidered  by  the  call l't  i  passing \n11 \nupon  plans  for  ]970  desegregation,  (70a) \nJudge  McMillan's  plan  should  be  approved  as  intelli \nall \ngent  effort  to  comply  with  the  Brown decision.  When  first \nconsidering  the  idea  of  eliminating  racially  identifiable \nall \nschools  by  a  percentage  formula  he  pointed  ant  that: \n,  ,  ,  it  would  be  a  great  bcnofi t.  to  the  community,  It \nwould  tend  t.o  eliminate  shopping  arollnd  for  schools; \nall  the  schools,  ill  the  New  Kel1t  County  language, \nwould  be  \"just  schools\";  it  would  make  all  schools \nequally  \"desirable\"  \"undesi !'able\"  depending  the \n01'  011 \npoint  of  view;  it  would  equalize  the  benefit.s  and  bur \ndens  of  desegTegation  over  the  whole  county,  ,  ,  it \nj \nwould  get the Board  out of the  business of lawsuits  and \nreal  estate  zoning  and  leave  it  ill  tho  education  busi \nness;  and  it  would  be  a  tremendous  step  toward  the \nstability  of  real  estate  values  in  the  community  and \nthe  progress  of  education  of  childrml.  Though  seem \niJlgly  radical  in  nat.ure,  if  viewed  by  people  who  live \nin  totally  segregated  neighborhoods,  it  mny  like \nSUI'-\n• \n• \n\n52 \ngery  be  the  most  conservative  solution  to  the  whole \nproblem and the one  most likely to  produce  good  educa \ntion  for  all  at  a  minimum  cost. \nThis  record  shows  that  there  is  no  reason  not  to  use \nschool  buses  to  integrate  the  schools  except  to  keep  them \nsegregated.  Busing  is  a  legitimate  technique  of  educa \ntional  administration.  In Charlotte schools  today,  the \nwalk~ \nin  neighborhood  scbool  i!:l  primarily  a  phenomenon  in  the \nblack  neighborhoods.  Of  17,000  children  ill  black  schools, \nonly  about  541  are  now  transported  to  school  (142a);  no \nblack  school  depends  very  much  on  school  buses.  By  con \ntrast,  white  schools  have  the  opposite  pattern,  and  \"sub \nurban schools,  including  the  newest  ones,  have  been  located \nfar  away  from  black  centers,  and  where  they  cannot  be \nreached  by  many  students  without  (ibi·d.). \ntran~portation\" \nThe Center for  Urban Education  recently said  that  \"Riding \nthe  yellow  school  bus  is  as  much  a  symbol  of  American \neducation in  1970  as  the  little  red  schoolhouse  was  in  1900. \nAnd,  until  recently,  it hud  conveyed  no  emotional overtones \nother  than  nostalgia  for  lost  youth.\"  (\"On  the  i\\[atter  of \nBusing:  A  Staff  Memorandum  from  the  Center for  Urban \nEducation\",  February 1970.)  The  Civil Rights  Commission \nhas  made  the  same  point: \nThns  the  arguments  that  some  now  make  about  the \nevils  of  busing  would  appear  less  than  ingenuou!:l. \nThe  plain  fact  is  that  every  day  of  every  school  year \n18  million  pupils·  10  percent  of  the  Nation's  pnblic \nschool  children  are  bused  to  and  from  school,  and \nthe  buses  log  in  the  aggregate  more  than  two  billion \nmiles-·  nine  billion  passenger  miles  each  year.  I t  \nalso  should  be  understood  that  the  overwhelming  ma \njority  of  school  busing  has  nothing  to  do  with  deseg \nregation  or achieving racial balance.  The  trpnd  toward \nconsolidation  of  schools,  for  example,  particularly  in \nrural  areas,  requires  extensive  busing.  I t  causes  no \n\n. \n-\n53 \ndisruption  to  the  educational  routines  of  the  children \nand  is  treated  as  normal  and  sensible . \n•  •  • \nIn  the  Commission's  view,  the  emphasis  that  some \nput  on  the  issue  of  busing  is  misplaced.  As  most \nAmericans  would  agree,  it  is  the  kind  of  education \nthat  awaits  our  children  at  the  end  of  the -bus  ride \nthat  is  really important. \n(Statement  of  the  United  States  Commission  on  Civil \nRights  Concerning  the  \"Statement  by  the  President \non  Elementary  and  Secondary  School  Desegregation\", \nApril  12,  1970) \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons  it  is  respectfully  submitted \nthat the  petition for  certiorari  should  he  granted  to  review \nthe  judgment  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for \nthe  Fourth  Circuit. \n• \nRespectfully  submitted, \nJACK  GREENBERG \nM.

The maintenance of the 50% \nlimitation on minority assignments was admittedly a large \n[1]  [2]  When  an  unconstitutionally  segregated  school \nfactor  in  the  Board’s  decision  to  reassign  students  in \nsystem  prohibited  under  Brown  I  exists,  the  school \n1978.  The  50%  requirement  is  embodied  in  the  joint \nauthorities  are  under  an  affirmative  obligation  to \nproposal adopted by the district court in 1974, but the \ndismantle the dual system. If the school authorities default \nBoard independently decided in 1978 to adhere to its \nin their obligation, the “district court has broad power to \ncommitment under the 1974 proposal. The district court \nfashion  a  remedy  that  will  assure  a  unitary  school \ndid not intervene to coerce the reassignments, and the \nsystem.”  Swann  v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of \nBoard did not seek to be relieved of any outstanding order \nEducation, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1267. When the \nof the district court. \nsystem achieves compliance with Brown I, further judicial \n  \nsupervision over the school system is unnecessary unless \nFor  these  reasons  Pasadena  is  inapplicable,  and  the \nschool authorities deliberately attempt to segregate the \nvalidity of the Board’s decision to reassign students in \nschools by altering attendance patterns. Id. at 31-32, 91 \norder to maintain racial ratios must be evaluated under \nS.Ct. at 1283, 1284. The school system in Pasadena was \nprinciples  enunciated  in  Swann.  The  School  Board  is \nfound to be unconstitutionally segregated in 1970, and the \nvested with broad discretionary powers over educational \ndistrict court enjoined the school board to assign students \npolicy and is well within its powers when it decides that \nin such a manner that no school would have a majority of \nas a matter of policy schools should not have a majority \nminority students. The board complied with the order and \nof  minority  students.  See  Swann  v.  Charlotte-\nreassigned students to achieve racial balance.

The \n  \nSupreme  Court  reversed  and  held  that  Swann  limited \nBecause we conclude that the 1978 assignment plan was a \njudicial  remedial  power  to  cases  in  which  the  school \nvalid exercise of the Board’s powers, we do not address \nauthorities have caused segregation. 427 U.S. at 434, 96 \nthe alternate holding relied on by the district court.

In Pasadena there was no showing that the \njudgment of the district court is affirmed. \npost-1970  changes  in  the  racial  composition  of  the \n  \nschools were caused by the Board’s actions.

Lastly, I  \t\r  \nconcur  with  the  majority  that  the  district  court’s \ninjunction was unwarranted and that the district court’s \ndiscovery sanctions were not an abuse of discretion. \n  \n Footnotes \n1  Since this case was first filed in 1965, the various successor plaintiffs have been referred to as the Swann plaintiffs, a practice we \ncontinue to observe here. \n \n2  For clarity’s sake, we will often refer within to the presiding district judge by name. \n \n3  CMS used “satellite zones” in connection with elementary schools. Under this method, students from a small geographic area \nlocated outside an elementary school’s primary attendance area were assigned to that school. J.A. 15571, 16052; see also Swann, \n402 U.S. at 9 & n. 3, 91 S.Ct. 1267. The use of satellite zones was implemented by “pairing” elementary schools—students from a \npredominantly black neighborhood were bused to a school in a predominantly white neighborhood for grades K–3, and students \nfrom a predominantly white neighborhood were bused to a school in a predominantly black neighborhood for grades 4–6. J.A. \n15571, 16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9–10, 91 S.Ct. 1267. \n \n4  Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based on that fact and other findings, the district court determined \nthat William Capacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief, but that he did have standing to \npursue compensatory relief. Capacchione v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg Sch., 57 F.Supp.2d 228, 240 (W.D.N.C.1999). Another group \nof white parents intervened in the consolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant, claimed that CMS \nhas achieved unitary status. The various groups of plaintiffs that have joined in Capacchione’s claims are hereinafter referred to as \n“the Capacchione plaintiffs.” \n \n5  For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancillary factors identified by the district court as “Green factors.” \n \n6  Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan “after the deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery \nhad expired.” On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the federal rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to \ndiscovery requests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore, a more precipitant proposal could not have \nincorporated the various expert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submitted earlier in the course of the \nlitigation necessarily would have been based largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have been far less useful \nand pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in advance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five months \nbefore the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor the parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary \ntiming of the Remedial Plan’s submission. \n \n7  Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it initially was the extent of the Board’s compliance with the prior \ndesegregation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for even that purpose. The ease with which some of the \nproposed Plan remedies could be realized, e.g., merely distributing available funding to address the stark disparity in basic \nresources such as instructional materials and media centers, see J.A. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board had not fully \nimplemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders. The court nonetheless observed that “while the goal of perfect \ncompliance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been presented that school authorities were guilty of easily \ncorrectable errors.” Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 283. To the contrary, the Plan thoroughly documented the Board’s failings and \nthe facility with which they could be rectified. The district court simply chose to ignore this highly relevant evidence. \n \n8  Though we need not grant CMS the same deference afforded the promulgations and adjudications of a federal administrative \nagency, the formal declarations of its governing Board “do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts \nand litigants may properly resort for guidance.” Ritter v. Cecil County Office of Housing & Community Dev., 33 F.3d 323, 328 (4th \nCir.1994) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). \n \n9  Judge McMillan’s final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that no school should become “racially identifiable.” Swann, 311 \nF.Supp. at 268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with “racially imbalanced,” which, as noted within, describes a \nschool with an African–American student population deviating more than fifteen points in either direction from the county–wide \nnorm. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 246. \n \n10  Judge Potter incorrectly declared that “Martin was not a unitary status hearing[.]” Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 250. In fact, as the \n  52 \n \n\n \naccompanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the Capacchione plaintiffs do today, that CMS had \nachieved unitary status. Intervening African–American parents, like those herein, maintained to the contrary. In actuality, there is \nlittle difference between today’s case and Martin, and Judge McMillan’s findings in the latter are as binding on the parties as any \nothers made in the course of this litigation. \n \n11  The strategies described in the Remedial Plan may be of particular help to the court in deciding whether practicable measures are \navailable. The Plan proposes, among other things, to divide Mecklenburg County into three to five demographically similar \n“clusters,” within which students may choose to attend any school, magnet or otherwise. Where the demand for a given school \nexceeds the available room, spots would be assigned by lottery based on factors such as proximity, sibling attendance, and racial, \nethnic, and economic diversity. The Plan also outlines a formal mechanism to disseminate information regarding the enrollment \nprocess, and it provides that the Board will work with the business community and local government to secure subsidies for \ndisadvantaged families wishing to relocate to areas in which low-cost housing is scarce. See J.A. 11053–59. \n \n12  However, if a district court retains jurisdiction over one or more Green factors, it may, upon a proper showing, reassert control \nover a factor previously adjudged to have attained unitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 508–09, 112 S.Ct. 1430 (Souter, J., \nconcurring). \n \n13  The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the Capacchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J. Armor, could offer no reliable \ntestimony on the subject. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 264. \n \n14  It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benjamin Disraeli, depending on one’s source), “There are three kinds \nof lies—lies, damned lies and statistics.” A common difficulty in dealing with statistics is illustrated by the district court’s analysis \nof Dr. Gardner’s study. The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest category, two were in Group 1 and two \nwere in Group 3. Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 264–65. Next, the court observed that the two highest ratings accorded elementary \nschools were again split between Groups 1 and 3. Id. at 265. Based on this selective culling of the data, the lower court concluded \nthat “the results of Dr. Gardner’s analysis do not show disparities along racial lines.” Id. at 264. \nThe forest that is CMS is not sufficiently mapped by the documentation of a few trees. We could accurately say, for example, \nthat omission from Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the district court as having one of the highest \nratings would lower the Group 1 average by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that seven of the twenty-\nthree Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored below 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent) \nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that none of the Group 1 high schools scored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 \nscored at 50 or above. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with some skepticism once it became known that \nthere are but fourteen high schools in CMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in Group 1. \nThe pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gardner’s research lies in the general conclusions that can be \ndrawn from the entirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general matter, imbalanced-black schools in CMS \nare in worse shape than those attended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that premise, the lone remaining \nquestion of any significance is “Why?” \n \n15  The district court made no findings as to whether practicable remedies exist with respect to facilities. In light of the court’s refusal \nto consider the Board’s proposed five-year Remedial Plan, we cannot determine in the first instance whether practicable remedies \nto the current disparities exist. We therefore remand to the district court for development on this point. We note, however, that the \nRemedial Plan specifically identifies disparities associated with race in baseline needs for schools’ instructional materials and \nmedia centers, and the lack of any standardized criteria to evaluate the adequacy of these resources. J.A. 11037–38. The Plan \nproposes to achieve uniformity in resources across schools by imbalanced allocations that reflect the schools’ current resource gaps \nand imbalances. J.A. 11038–40. Likewise, the Remedial Plan identifies disparities associated with race in the instructional \nfacilities, and proposes building replacements or renovating existing facilities for sixteen schools that are either racially identifiable \nas black or are located in a predominantly black census tract. J.A. 11041–42. Uniform building maintenance standards and \nprocedures are proposed. J.A. 11043. Monitoring, evaluation, and development of appropriate criteria for evaluation are also \nproposed to maintain equity across the school system’s resources and facilities. J.A. 11038–40, 11042–43. \n \n16  Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the Board and the Swann plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of \nofficial discrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student achievement and student discipline. The court found in \nthe negative, concluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas. \nWith respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, we must vacate Judge Potter’s holding that unitary status had been \nachieved, and we do so on a basis similar to our analysis of the Green factor of transportation. Judge Potter found that disparities \nin student achievement existed but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segregation and (2) could not be remedied \nby any practicable measure. Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 280–81. An analysis of disparities in student achievement may only \nbe appropriate once the school system has achieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F.Supp. at 1309 (“Until \nunlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate whether some of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial \ndifferences or to ‘socio-economic–cultural’ lag.”). At the very least, as with transportation, student achievement in this case is \ninextricably intertwined with the other Green factors, particularly student assignment. Therefore, having vacated certain of the \n  53 \n \n\n \ndistrict court’s rulings on unitary status, including its ruling with respect to student assignment, we must also vacate the district \ncourt’s conclusion on student achievement. \nWe have reviewed and considered the district court’s consideration of student discipline, and we affirm the district court’s \nresolution as to this ancillary factor. \n \n17  While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation as a Green factor, it does propose siting new schools in a \nmanner calculated to promote racial balance in CMS. J.A. 11042. If CMS chooses sites for new schools that are more accessible to \nthe majority of the black population, we presume that fewer black students would have to be bused to the suburbs for purposes of \ndesegretation. A new approach to school siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such vestiges remain, in those \nareas in which CMS has not yet achieved unitary status. \n \n18  The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbalanced if its proportion of African–American students varied \nmore than fifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998–99, African–Americans represented 42.7% of the elementary \nstudents in CMS, 41.7% of the middle school students, and 39.6% of the high school students. J.A. 11574. An elementary school \nwould therefore be designated imbalanced-black if more than 57.7% of its students are African–American; conversely, if African–\nAmericans constituted less than 27.7% of the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white. \n \n19  Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to be a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before \nthe district court casts substantial doubt upon the Board’s ability to effect a practicable remedy. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at \n258–59: \nCMS runs the risk of losing significant numbers of teachers if its faculty assignment policies become too restrictive.... \nAnother practical problem faced by the district is the fact that it must constantly hire thousands of new teachers in the midst of \na national teacher shortage .... [which] is especially pronounced with regard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the \ncountry. \n \n20  Although the Board’s official position, as outlined in its Remedial Plan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do \nremain as to faculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the contrary. The district court’s failure to \nconsider the Plan was therefore harmless in this narrow respect. \n \n21  The courts’ caution essentially anticipates the position of the Swann plaintiffs in this case: that magnet schools are insufficiently \ndesegregative at best, and that at worst they simply provide an “escape hatch” for white students who would otherwise attend \nmajority black schools, leaving those majority black schools even more segregated than they had been before. \n \n22  Judge Potter recognized that the optional schools “were similar to today’s magnet schools, ‘both having countywide enrollment \nand a racial balancing target.’ ” Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d. at 286. He nonetheless concluded that the schools established after \n1992 under the expanded magnet schools program “differ from optional schools in that [the new] magnets offer specialized \ncurricula and thereby confer a benefit above and beyond the regular academic program.” Id. at 286–87 n. 49. But nothing in the \nrecord supports this view. To the contrary, assuming arguendo that “specialized curricula” constitute a “benefit,” the magnet \nschools instituted after 1992 provide precisely the same “benefit” as the pre–1992 “optional schools.” See J.A. 10552 (proposed \n1992 pupil assignment plan recommending continuation of six magnet schools already in place); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter noting \nthat magnet schools were called “optional schools” prior to 1992); J.A. 10651 (Summary of Findings From Research on Magnet \nSchools explaining that “[o]ur optional schools function as magnet schools”); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee Plan explaining that “[the] \ntraditional schools presently existing in Charlotte–Mecklenburg are good examples” of curriculum specialty schools, “sometimes \ncalled magnet schools”). After all, it was only because the optional schools did offer certain “specialized curricula” that parents \n(including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, J.A. 2489) were willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet \nschools program, to enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J.A. 13641, 15616. In fact, the original six “open” \nand “traditional” schools remain among CMS’s more heavily subscribed magnets. See J.A. 10292–340. Myers Park Traditional, for \nexample, had 245 students on its waiting list for the 1998–99 school year. See J.A. 2159. \n \n23  For simplicity, we often refer within to non-African-American students in the magnet schools as “white.” \n \n24  The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern of school officials with demographic changes, “CMS could not \nhave been motivated by any desire to comply with its court-ordered duty to eradicate vestiges of segregation.” Brief of Appellees \nat 85. But this stands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the effect of their acts, not from their motives, whether \nschool authorities comply with a desegregation decree. See Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 462, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 \nL.Ed.2d 51 (1972) (“It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the sole or dominant motivation behind choices of a \ngroup of legislators, and the same may be said of the choices of a school board.... Thus we have focused upon the effect—not the \npurpose or motivation—of a school board’s action in determining whether it is a permissible method of dismantling a dual \nsystem.”) (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover, even if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading \nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously aware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts \nas an obstacle to achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the vestiges of discrimination in the school \n  54 \n \n\n \nsystem, not as the condition that itself necessitated a remedy. See, e.g., J.A. 13597–98, 15572–73 (Stolee Plan identifying “a \ngrowing and moving population” as one of several factors creating instability in student assignment under the pre–1992 system of \npairing and satelliting); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the U.S. Department of Education listing “demographic and \nresidential  patterns”  as  one  of  several  increasing  strains  on  the  pairing  system);  J.A.  2712  (testimony  of  former  CMS \nSuperintendent John Murphy that “[w]e really weren’t going to be bringing about desegregation and racially balanced schools \nunless we began to address the issue of housing at the same time.”). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in response \nto, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, see supra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that \nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white and black population centers, would put a greater strain on \nthe process of desegregation. \n \n25  In accord with this court-approved policy, from 1975 to 1991, prior to expansion of the magnet schools plan, CMS continued to \nuse a race-conscious lottery system to control enrollment in optional, or magnet, schools. See J.A. 2489–91, 2822–23, 14502, \n16885–89. \n \n26  Judge McMillan’s orders and the Supreme Court’s opinion in Swann did consistently signal concern with the imposition of racial \nproportions or ratios by federal courts. That concern, however, is rooted in the problem of federal courts exceeding their remedial \ndiscretion, not in any objection to the use of racial proportions or ratios by school boards in their desegregation plans. Thus, the \nSupreme Court noted that, “[t]he constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every \ncommunity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole,” but went on to conclude that “the very \nlimited use made of mathematical ratios was within the equitable remedial discretion of the District Court.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 24–\n25, 91 S.Ct. 1267. That this concern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial power to order remedial action, not in the \nimpropriety of using racial proportions to remedy the vestiges of segregation, is nowhere more apparent than in Chief Justice \nBurger’s statement in Swann. There the Chief Justice noted that while in certain circumstances it might be inappropriate for a \nfederal court to require adherence to “a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting” the population of the “district as a \nwhole”, it would be “within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities” to do so. Id. at 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267. \n \n27  We leave it for the parties to argue, and the district court to decide in the first instance, whether any party may be entitled to an \naward of attorney’s fees based on the outcome of proceedings on remand. \n \n1  Those represented by Capacchione and Grant will be referred to as the “plaintiff-intervenors.” \n \n2  At trial, Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified that unitary status depended on every school being in balance. \nSee J.A. XV–7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267 (“The constitutional command to \ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school \nsystem as a whole.”). \nI find equally erroneous the Swann plaintiffs’ assertion at appellate argument that “[t]he issue of how many schools are balanced \nhas never been a question in this case.” App. Tr. 91. The racial composition of schools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, \nand is very much key to a review of the district court’s declaration of unitary status. See Swann, 311 F.Supp. at 268 (ordering \nCMS to assign pupils “in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various grade levels have about the same \nproportion of black and white students”). \n \n3  For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in 1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students \nin the district grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 475, 112 S.Ct. 1430. \n \n4  Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this analysis on three grounds: \n(1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black enrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have had low black \nenrollment for the past three or more years and that were operating in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,] \nand (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these schools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced \nbecause of the substantial white enrollment growth in the outskirts of the county. \nJ.A. XXXIII–16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267 (observing “that the existence of some \nsmall number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark of a system that still \npractices segregation by law”). \n \n5  Even the Swann plaintiffs admit that ten years after the district court charged the board with taking affirmative steps to desegregate \nschools, the system “w[as] nearly 100% statistically compliant with the court’s orders.” Plaintiff–Appellants’ Brief at 38. \n \n6  Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it could be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set \nforth in Baliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required to prove the existence of racial disparity in its \nfacilities. See United States v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d 301, 309–11 (2d Cir.1999), vacated on reh’g, 197 F.3d 41 (2d Cir.1999). \n \n7  From this footnote and the district court’s detailed discussion about the cause of any disparity in CMS’s facilities, it appears that \n  55 \n \n\n \nthe district court really made alternative rulings on the facilities question: The court first concluded that CMS and the Swann \nplaintiffs bore the burden of proof with regard to facilities and that they failed to carry that burden. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d \nat 267 (“[T]he Swann Plaintiffs have failed to overcome the Court’s previous findings on facilities by establishing the requisite \ndiscriminatory intent and causation.”). The court then ruled in the alternative, as indicated by the footnote and the findings, that the \nplaintiff-intervenors proved that any disparities were the result of factors unrelated to state action. \n \n8  Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors outside CMS’s control, the district court found that CMS has \nundertaken sundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted financial incentives for teachers and principals tied \nto student performance, urged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level classes, challenged all students by \nremoving “fluff courses” from the curriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate student preparedness, \nand adopted pre-kindergarten programs to accelerate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at \n273–275. \n \n9  I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court’s disapproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is \nsolely a limitation on a district court’s remedial power, and that school authorities may impose such rigid racial quotas to remedy \nthe identical wrong. In Swann, the Court addressed the authority of the district court to impose rigid racial quotas, but did not \nexplicitly address the issue of whether school authorities could do so. Swann, 402 U.S. at 24–25, 91 S.Ct. 1267. The same day, \nhowever, the Court struck down a state anti-busing law because it “flatly forb[ade] assignment of any student on account of race or \nfor the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools.” North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45, \n91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971). This time addressing race-based assignments as a tool available to “school authorities ... to \nfulfill [ ] their constitutional obligation to eliminate existing dual school systems,” the Court reiterated Swann’s distinction between \nunacceptable rigid quotas and acceptable quotas used as “starting points in shaping a remedy.” Id. at 46, 91 S.Ct. 1284. \nCommon sense likewise compels me to reject the view that Swann forbids courts to impose inflexible quotas, but sanctions the \nidentical action by school authorities. Under such a reading of Swann, school authorities would be at liberty to implement \nprograms to remedy the effects of segregation which the district court would be prohibited from ordering for the identical \nremedial purpose. However, whether imposed by a court upon a recalcitrant school board or voluntarily adopted by a school \nboard to meet the requirements of Brown and Green, the constitutional implications are the same. Even when intended to serve a \npermissible remedial purpose, unduly rigid race-based assignments exceed permissible limits of race-based remedial action. \n \n10  I recognize that parents might perceive that one “fungible” conventional school is superior to another because of a number of \nintangibles such as the reputation of teachers or the newness of facilities. However, these “personal preferences” do not rise to a \nlevel of constitutional significance. See Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F.Supp.2d 358, 380 n. 43 (W.D.Ky.2000). \nMagnet schools, on the other hand, are a completely different animal and therefore the admissions process used must be more \nclosely scrutinized. \n \n11  Though the present case was brought on behalf of a white child denied admission to a magnet school, the policy as written could \nhave just as easily denied a black child admission to the magnet school. See Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 \nF.Supp.2d 358, 377 (W.D.Ky.2000) (racial quota in a magnet school resulting in black students being denied admission even \nthough the school was several hundred students below capacity). \n \n12  The Supreme Court’s application of strict scrutiny has indeed been unwavering. In Adarand, the Court refused to apply a lesser \nstandard of scrutiny to racial classifications enacted by Congress. Though Congress itself is charged with enforcing the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s promise of equal protection via “appropriate legislation,” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 5, the Supreme Court in \ninterpreting the Fifth Amendment held Congress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities. See Adarand, \n515 U.S. at 224, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (observing “that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor \nsubject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial \nscrutiny”). \nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not apply when a school district is under court order to dismantle \nthe dual system. Such an approach, however, ignores two of the three pillars of Supreme Court’s equal protection analysis: \nskepticism of all racial preferences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of the race of the person \nburdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 223–24, 115 S.Ct. 2097. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann \nplaintiffs, the approach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court order of the necessary tools required to \nestablish a unitary schools system. \nThe point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the government in support of a racial classification, and the \nevidence offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of \nrace in governmental decisionmaking.... Strict scrutiny does not “trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were \nequally objectionable”; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all governmental race-based decisions in order to decide \nwhich are constitutionally objectionable and which are not. \nId. at 228, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful evaluation demanded by the Supreme \nCourt will preserve inviolate proper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of desegregating a government \nactor does not stand equal protection on its head by denying some students educational opportunities solely because of their race. \n  56 \n \n\n \n \n13  CMS also presented diversity as an alternative compelling state interest. See Capacchione, 57 F.Supp.2d at 289. In this circuit, it is \nunsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest. See Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130 \n(4th Cir.1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1019, 120 S.Ct. 1420, 146 L.Ed.2d 312 (2000). Assuming without deciding whether diversity \nmay be a compelling state interest, I would hold that the magnet admissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. \nWhether the interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions policy as currently written is in no sense narrow. \nIt is difficult to imagine any interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored. \n \n14  CMS concedes that if unitary status is upheld, Grant is entitled to attorney fees. However, CMS takes a much different view of \nCapacchione’s actions insofar as Capacchione originally attacked only the magnet program and did not have sights set on unitary \nstatus. Nonetheless, the record is clear that Capacchione actively participated with Grant in the unitary status litigation. \n \n \n\t\r  \n \t\r  \n\t\r  \n \n  57 \n ",

We  recognize,  of  cou)\"se,  that  a  change  in  the \nelementary  schools  may  require  some  modification  of  the \njunior  and  senior  high  school  plans,  and  our  remand  is \nnot  intended  to  preclude  t.his. \n1. \nThe  Charlotte-1.fecklenburg  school  system  serves  a  pop \nulation of over 600,000  people  in a  combined city and county \narea \nof  550  square  miles.  With  84-,500  pupils attending 106 \nschools,  it ranks  as  the  nation's 43rd  largest  school  district. \nIn  Swann  v.  Clwrlottc-Mecklenbu.l\"g  Rd.  of  Ed.,  369  F.2d \n29  (4th  Cir.  1966),  we  approved  a  desegl\"egation  plan  based \non  geographic  zoning  with  a  free  transfer  provision.  How \never,  this  plan  did  not  eliminate  the  dnal  system  of  schools. \nThe  district  court  found  that  elm'ing  the  1969-70  school \nyear,  some 16,000  black pupils,  out of a  total of 24,700,  were \nattending  25  predominantly  black  schools,  that  faculties \nhad  not  been  integrated,  and  that  othe,·  administrative \na \npractices,  including  free  transfer  plan,  tended  t.o  per \npetuate  segregation. \nNotwithstanding  our  1965  approval  of  the  school  board's \nplan,  the  dist.rict  court  properly  held  that  the  board  was \nimpermissibly  operating  a  dual  system  of  schools  in  the \nThe  board's  plan  provides:  \"The  faculties  of  all  schools  will  be \n1 \nassigned  so  that the  ratio  of  black  teachers  to  white  teachers  in  each \nschool  will  be  approximately  the  same  as  the  ratio  of  black  teachers \nto  white  teachers  in  the  entire  school  system.\"  We  have  directed \not.her  schoul  boards  to  desegregate  their  faculties  in  this  manner. \nSee  Nesbit  v.

The  district \njudge  pointed  out  that  black  residences  are  concentrated \nin  the  northwest  quadrant  of  Charlotte  as  a  result  of  both \npublic  and  private  action.  North  Carolina  courts,  in  com \nmon  with  many  courts  elsewhere,  enforced  racial  restric \ntive  covenants  on  real  until  Shelley  v.  Kraemer, \nproperty~ \n334  U.S.  1  (1948)  prohibited  this  discriminatory  practice. \nPresently  the  city  zoning  ordinances  differentiate  between \nblack  and  white  residential  areas.  Zones  for  black  areas \npermit  dense  occupancy,  while  most  white  areas  are  zoned \nfor  restricted land usage.  The district judge also found that \nurban  renewal  projects,  supported  by  heavy  federal  financ \ning  and  the  active  participation  of  local  government,  con \ntributed  to  the  city's  racially  segregated  housing  patterns. \nThe  school  boara,  for  its  part,  located  schools  in  black  resi \ndential  areas  and  fixed  the  size  of  the  schools  to  accommo \ndate  the  needs  of immediate  neighborhoods.  Predominantly \nblack\"  schools  were  the  inevitable  result.  The  interplay  of \nthese  policies  on  both  residential  and  educational  segrega \ntion  previously  has  been  recognized  by  this  and  other \ncourts.

All  pupils  are  eligible  to  ride  school \nnl:! \nbuses  if  they  live  farther  than  miles  from  the  schools \nto  which  they  are  assigned.  Overall  statistics  show  that \nabout  one-half  of  the  pupils  entitled  to  transportation  ride \nschool  buses.  Only  541  pupils  were  hussed  in  October  1969 \nto  predominantly  black  schools,  which  had  a  total  enroll \nment  of  over  17,000.  In  contrast,  8  schools  located  outside \nthe  black  residential  area  have  in  the  aggregate  only  96 \n1% \nstudents living  within  miles.

I t   eliminated  a \nschool  bus  system  that  operated  a  racial  basis,  and \n011 \nestablished  nondiscriminatory  practices  in  other  facets  of \nthe  scbool  system.  I t   modified  its  free  transfer  plan  to \nprevent  rcsegl'egation,  and  it  provided  for  integration  of \nthe  faculty  and  administrative  st.aff. \nThe  district  court,  after  a  painstaking  analysis  of  the \nboard's proposals and  the  relevant authorities,  disapproved \nthe  board's final  plan,  primarily  because  it  left  ten  schools \nnearly a]]  black.  In  reaching this decision,  the district court \nheld that the  board must integrate the student body of every \nschoo]  to  convert from  a  dual  system  of  schools,  which  had \nbeen  established  by  stat.e  action,  to  a  unitary  system. \nThe  necessity  of  dealing  with  segregation  that  exists \nhecause  governmental  policies  foster  segregated  neighbor \nhood  schools  is  not  confined  to  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSchool  District.  Similar  segregat.ion  occurs  in  many  other \ncities  throughout  the  nation,  and  constitutional  principles \ndealing  with  it  should  be  applied  national1y.  The  solution \nis  not  free  from  difficulty.

May \n26,  1970 \nBoth  the  findings  of  the  district  court  and  the  evidence \nsubmitted  by  the  board  are  based  On  estimates  that  rest \nOn  many  variables.  Past  practice  has  shown  that  a  large \npercentage  of  st.udents  eligible  for  bus  transportation  pre \nfer  to  provide  their  own  transportation.  However,  it  is \ndifficult  to  accurately  predict  how  mallY  eligible  st.udents \nwill  accept  transportation  on  the  new  routes  and  schedules. \nThe  number  of  students  that.  a  bus  can  carry  each  day \ndepends  in  part  on  the  number  of  trips  the  bus  can  make. \nScheduling two  trips for  a  bus  generally  reduces  costs.  But \nstudent  drivers  may  not  be  able  to  spend  the  time  required \nfor  two  trips,  so  that  aduH  drivers  will  have  to  be  hired \nat  substantially  highel'  salaries.  I t  is  difficult  to  accurately \nfOI'ecast  how  traffic  delays  will  affect  the  time  needed  for \neach  trip,  for  large  numbers  of  scbool  buses  themselves \ngenerate  traffic  problems  that  only  experience  can  measure. \nThe  board  based  its  projections on  each  54-passenger  bus \ncarrying  about  40  high  school  pupils  or  54  junior  high  and \nelementary  pupils  for  one  roundtrip  a  day.  Using  this \nformula,  it  arrived  at  a  need  of  4-22  additional  buses  for \ntransporting 19,285  a.dditional  pupils.  This  appears  to  be  a \nless  efficient  operation  than  tbe  present system which  trans \nports 23,600  pupils with  280  buses,  but the board's  witnesses \nsuggest  that  prospects  of  heavier  traffic  justify  the  dif \nference.  The  board  also  envisioned  parking  t.hat  seems  to \nbe  more  elahorate  than  that cUl'I'ently  used  at  some  schools. \nIn  making  its  findings,  the  district  court  applied  factors \nderived  from  present  bus  operation,  such  as  the  annual \noper'ating  cost  pel'  student,  t.he  average  number  of  trips \neach  bus  makes,  the  capacity  of  t.he  buses  including  per \nmissible  overloads,  and  t.he  percentage  of  eligible  pupils \nwho  use  other  forms  of  transportation.  The  district  court \nalso  found  no  need  for  expensive  parking  facilities  or  for \n\n194a \nOpinio,t1s  of  C01/rt  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nadditional  personnel  whose  costl;  could  not  he  absorbed  by \nthe  amount  allocated  for  operating  expenses.  While  we \nrecognize that no  estimate  whether submitted by  the board \nor  made  by  the  court  can  be  absolutely  correct,  we  accept \nas  1I0t  clearly  erroneous  the  findings  of  the  district  court. \nOpposition  to  the  assignment  of  pupils  nnder  both  the \nboard's  plan  and  the  plan  the  court  approved  centered  on \nbussing,  which  nnrnbers  among  its  critics  both  black  and \nwhite  parents.  This  criticism,  however,  cannot  justify  the \nmaintenance  of a  dual  system  of  schools.  Cooper  v.  Aaron, \n358  U.S.  1  (1958).  Bnssillg  is  neither  new  nor  unusual.  It \nhas  been  used  for  years  to  trawlport  pupils  to  consolidated \nschools  in  both  racially  dual  and  unitary  school  systems. \nFigures  compiled  by  the  National  Education  Association \nshow  that  nationally  the  numbc\\'  of  pupils bussed  increased \nfrom  12  mill ion  in  the  1958-59  school  yea r  to  17  million  a \ndecade  later.  In  North  Carolina  54.970  of  all  pupils  are \nbussed.  There  the  average  daily  roundtl'ip  is  24  miles,  and \nthe  annual  cost is  over $14,000,000.  The  Charlotte-Mecklen \nburg  School  District  presently  busses  a bont  23,600  pupils \nand  another 5,000  ride common  carriers. \nBussing  is  a  permissible  tool  fa)'  achieving  integration, \nbut  it  is  not  a  panacea.  In  determining  who  should  be \nbussed  alld  where  they  should  be  bussed,  a  school  board \nshould  take  into  consideration  the  age  of  the  pupils,  the \ndistance  and  time  required  for  tl'aDsportatioD,  the  effect \non  traffic,  and  the  cost  ill  relation  to  the  board's  resources. \nThe  board  should  view  bussing- for  integl'ation  ill  the  light \nthat  it  views  bussing  for  othel'  legitimate  improvements, \nsuch  as school consolidation and  the location  of new  schools. \nIn  short,  the  boarn  should  draw  on  its  experience  with \nbussing in  general  the henefits  and  the  defects  so  that it \nmay  intelligently  plan  the  part  that hussing  \\v1U  play  in  a \nunitary  school  system. \n\n195a \nOpinio·118  of  Court.  of  Appeals  doled  May  1970 \n26, \nViewing  the  plan  the  disb'ict  court  approved  for  junior \nand  senior  high  schools  against.  these  principles  and  the \nbackground  of national,  state, and  local  transportation  pol \nicies,  we  ('.ollclude  that  it  provides  a  reasonable  way  of \nelminating  all  segregation  in  those  schoo1s.  The  estimated \nin \nincrease  the  number  of  junior  and  senior  high  school \nstudents  who  must be  bussed  is  about 17%  of all  pupils now \nbeing bussed,  The additional  pupils  are in  the  upper grades \nwill \nand  for  the  most  part  they  he  going  to  schools  already \nserved  by  busses  from  other  sections  of  the  district.

While  a  6070-40%  ratio \nof white  to  black  pupils  might  be  desirable  under  some  cil' \ncumstances,  rigid  adherellce  to  this  formula  in  every school \nshould  be  allowed  to  defeat  integration. \n110t \nOu  the  other  hand,  the  Finger  plan,  which  the  di\"triet \ncourt  approved,  will  require  transporting  9,300  pupils  in \n90  additional  buses.  The  greatest  portion  of  the  proposed \ntransportation  involves  cross-bussing  to  paired  schoo18-\nthat  is,  black  pupils  in  grades  one  through  four  would  be \ncarried  to  predominantly  white  schools,  and  white  pupils \nin  the  fifth  and  sixth  grades  would  be  transported  to  the \nblack  schools.  The  average  daily  roundtrip  approximates \n15  miles  through  central  city and  suburban  traffic. \nThe  additional  elementary  pupils  who  must  be  bussed \nrepresent  an  increase  of  39%  ovcr  all  pupils  presently \nbeing  bussed,  and  their  transportation  will  require  an  in \ncrease  of  about  32'10  ill  the  present  fleet  of  buses.  When \nthe  additional  bussing  for  elementary  pupils  is  coupled \nwith the  additional requiremcnts for  junior and senior high \nschools,  which  we  have  approved,  the  total  percentages  of \nincrease  are:  pupils,  56%,  and  buses,  49%.  The  board, wc \nbclieve,  should  not  be  required  to  undel'take  snch  extensive \nadditional  bussing  to  discharge  its  obligation  to  cl'eate  a \nunitary  school  system. \nIV. \nBoth  parties  oppose  a  remand.  Eacb  side  is  adamant \nthat  its  position  is  correct  the  school  board  seeks  total \nappr'oval  of  its  plan  and  the  plaintiffs  insist  on  implemen \ntation  of  the  Finger  plan.  We  are  favorably  impressed, \nhowever,  by  the  suggestion  of  the  United  States,  w'hich  at \n\n199a \nOpi'llio'lls  of  Court  of  A1Jpeals  dated  May \n26. .  1970 \nour invitation filed  a  hl'ief  as amicus  cnriae,  that  the  school \nboard  should  consider  alternative  plans,  particularly  for \nthe  elementary  schools.  We,  therefore,  will  vacate  the \njudgment.  of  the  district  court  and  remand  the  case  for \nreconsideration  of  the  assignment.  of  pupils  in  the  ele \nmentary  schools,  and  for  adjustments,  if  any,  that  this  may \nrequire  in  plans  for  t.he  junior  und  senior  high  schools. \nOn  remand,  we  suggest  that  the  district  court  should  di \nI'oct  the  school  board  to  consult  experts  from  the  Office  of \nEducation  of  tho  Department  of  Health,  Education,  and \n:Welfal'e,  and  to  explore  every  method  of  desegrega tion, \nincludillg rezoning with  without satellites, pairing, group \n01' \ning,  and  school  consolidation.

The  command  was  once  more \nreaffirmed  in  Garter  v.  West  Feliciana  School  Board,  396 \nU.S.  290  (1970),  requiring \"relief that will  at once  extirpate \nany  lingering  vestiges  of a  constitutionally prohibited  dual \nJ., \nschool  system.\"  (Harlan,  concurring  at  292). \nWe  face  in  this  case  a  school  district  divided  along \nracial  lines.  This  is  not  a  fortuity.  I t  is  the  result,  as  the \nmajority  has  recognized,  of  government  fostered  residen \ntial  patterns,  school  planning,  placement,  and,  as  the \nDistrict  Court  fonnd,  gerrymandering.  These  factors  have \ninteracted  on  each  other  so  that  by  this  date  the  black \nand white  populations,  in  school  and  at home,  are  virtually \nentirely  separate. \nAs  of November 7,  1969,  out of 106  schools in  the  system, \n57  were  racially  identifiable  as  white,  25  were  racially \nidentifiable  as  black.!  Of  these,  nine  were  all  white  schools \nand eleven all  black.  Of 24,714 black  students in  the  system, \n16,000  were  in  entirely  or  predominantly  black  schools. \n% \nIn  the  entire  system,  71  of  the  pupils  are  white,  29%  of  the \n1 \npupils  are  black.  The  District  Judge  deemed  a  school  having  86% \nor greater  white  population  ident.ifiable  as  white,  one  with  56%  or \ngreater  black  population  identifiable  as  black. \n\n203a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  .Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nThere  are  76  elementary  schools  with  over  44,000  pupils. \nIn  November  1969,  43  were  identifiable  as  white,  16  as \nblack,  with  13  of  the  lutter  98%  or  more  black,  and  none \nless  than  65%.  For  the  future  the  Board  proposes  little \nimprovement.  There  would  still  be  25  identifiably  white \nelementary  schools  and  approximately  half  of  the  white \nelementary  students  would  attend  schools  86  to  10010 \n\",,·hite.  Nine  schools  would  remain  83  to  100%  black,  serv \ning'  6,432  students  or  over half  the  black  elementary  pupils. \nTo  call  either  the  past  or  the  proposed  distribution  a \n\"unitary  system\"  would  be  to  embrace  an  And \nillusion.~ \nthe  majority  does  not  contend  that  the  system  is  unitary, \nfor  it  holds  that  \"the  district  court  properly  disapproved \nthe  school  board's  elementary  school  proposal  because  it \nleft  about  one-half  of  both  the  black  und  white  elementary \npupils  in  schools  that  were  nearly  completely  segregated.\" \nThe  Board's  duty  then  is  plain  and  unarguable:  to  convert \nto  a  unit,ary  system.  The  duty  is  absolut.e.  I t  is  not  to  be \ntempered  or  watered  down.

The  N  of  the  Cou·rl-Ordcred  Plan \necessify \nThe  plan  ordered  by  the  District  Court  works.  I t  does \nthe  job  of  desegregating  the  schools  completely.  This \n\"places  a  heavy  burden  upon  the  board  to  explain  its  pre \nference  for  an  apparently  less  effective  method.\"  Green, \nsupra  at  439. \nThe  most  significant  fact  about  the  District  Court's \nplan  is  that  it ..  or  one  like  it  is  the  only  one  that  can \nwork.  Obviously,  wben  the  black  students  are  all  on  one \nside  of  town,  the  whites  on  the  other,  only  transportation \nwill  bring  them  together.  The  District  Judge  is  quite \nexplicit: \nBoth  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  board  staff  appear \nto  have  agreed,  and  the  court  finds  as  a  fact  that  for \nthe  present  at  least,  there  is  no  way  to  desegregate \nthe  al1-black  schools  in  Northwest  Charlotte  without \nproviding  (and  continuing  to  provide)  bus  or  other \ntransportation  for  thousands  of  childrell.  All  plans \nand  all  variations of plans considered  for  this  purpose \nlead  in  one  fashion  or  another  to  that conclusion. \nThe  point has  been  perceived  by  the  counsel  for  the  Board, \nwho  have  candily informed  us  that  if  the  job  must  be  done \nthen  the  Finger  plan  is  the  way  to  do  it. \nThe  only  suggestion  that  there  is  a  possible  alternative \nmiddle  course  came  from  the  United  States,  participating \nas  amicus  curiae.

Accordingly,  here  attempt,  not  to  deal \nwe \nextensively  with  factual  matters,  but  rather  to  set \nforth  some  legal  considerations  which  may  be  helpful \nto  the  Court. \nNowithstanding  this  disclaimer,  the  Government  went  on \nto  imply  in  oral  argument  and  has  apparently  impressed \non  this  conrt  thn t  HE,V  eould  do  better.  No  concrete \nsolution  is  suggested  hut  t.he  Government  does  advert  to \nthe  possibilit.y  of  pairing  and  grouping  of  schools.  Two \npoints  stand  out.  First.,  pairing  anel  grouping  are  pre \ncisely  what  tbe  Finger  plan,  adopted  by  the  District  Court, \ndoes.  Second,  in  the  of  this  case,  these \ncircum~tances \nmethods  ltC'cessarily  entail  bussing. \nI  not  \"favorably  impressed\"  by  the  Government's \nalll \nperformance.  Its  vague  and  noncommital  representations \ndo  little  but  obscure  the  real  issnes,  introduce  uncertainty \nand  fail  to  meet  t.he  \"heavy  burden\"  necessary  t.o  over \nturn  the  Dist.rict  Court's  effective  plan.\n3 \n-\nA  federal  judge is  not  J·equired  to  consult  with  the  Department \n3 \nof  Health,  Edueatioll  and  Welfare  legal  issues.

The  Feasibility  of  the  Plan \nOf  course  it  goes  without  saying  that  school  boards \narc  not  obligated  to  do  the  impossible.  Federal  courts \ndo  not joust at  windmills.  Thus it is  proper to  ask whether \na  plan  is  feasible,  whether  it  can  be  accomplished.  There \nis  no  genuine  dispute  on  this  point.  The  plan  is  simple \nand  quite  efficient.  A  bus  will  make  one  pickup  in  the \nvicinity  of  the  children's  residences,  say  in  the  white \nresidential  area.  It then  will  make  an  express  trip  to  the \ninner-city  school.  Because  of  the  non-stop  featnre,  time \ncan  be  considerably  shortened  and  a  bus  could  make  a \nreturn  trip  to  pick  up  black  students  in  the  inner  city  and \nto convey them  to  the  outlying school.  There  is  no  evidence \nof  insurmountable  traffic  problems  due  to  the  increased \n.  . \n=  .\" • \n- = \ncontrolling  the  actions  of  states  and  their  subdivisions  is \npeculiarly  a  judicial  function. \nBowman  v.  County  School  Board  of  Charles  City  County,  382  F.2d \n326  (1967). \nAlthough  the  definition  of  goals  is  for  the  court,  HEW  may  be \nable  to  provide  technical  assistance  in  overcoming  the  logistical \nimpediments  to  the  desegregation  of  a  school  system.  Thus  it  was \nquite  understandable  that  at  the  outset  of  this  case  the  District \nCourt  invited  t.he  Bonrd  to  consult  with  HEW.  Desegregation  of \nthis  large  educational  system  was  likely  to  be  a  complex  and \nadmini5;tratively  difficult  task,  in  which  the  expertise  of  the  fed \neral  agency  might  be  of  help.  However,  after  a  substantial  period \nof  time  and  the  begiuning  of  a  new  school  year,  it  became  clear \nthat  the  Board  had  no  intention  of  devising  a  meaningful  plan, \nmuch  less  seeking  advice  on  how  to  do  so.  At  that  point  (Decem \nber  HI6!\"!)  with  the  need  for  speed  in  milld,  the  Judge  appointed \nan  expert  already  familiar  with  the  school  system  to  work  with \nthe  school  staff  ill  developing  a  plan. \nWhether  to  utilize  the  assistance  of  HEW  i:.  ordinarily  up  to \nthe  district judge.  Consultation  in  formulating  the  mechanics  of  a \nplan  is  not  obligatory.  The  method  used  by  the  Judge  in  this \nuase  was  certainly  sufficient.  Moreover,  now  that  a  plan  has  been \ncreated  and  it  appears  that  there  are  no  real  alternatives,  a  re \nmand  for  HEW's  advice  seems  an  exercise  in  futility. \n\n207a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nbussing.  Indeed,  straight  line  bussing  promises  to  be \n~ \nquicker.  The present average  one-way  trip  is  over 15  miles \nand  takes  one  hour  and  fourteen  minutes;  under  the  plan \nthe  average  one-way  trip  for  elementary  students  will  be \nless  than  seven  miles  and  35  minutes.  The  cost of all  of  the \nadditional  bussing  will  be  less  than  one  week's  operating \nbudget. 5 \nC.  The  Standard  of  Review \nIn  Bro!l.j'J1,  II,  the  Supreme  Court  charged  the  district \ncourts  with  the  enforcement  of  the  dictates  of  Brown  I. \nThe  ollly  indication  J  have  encollntered  that  a  serious  traffic \n4 \npI'oblem  will  be  ocea!;ioneu  by  the  additional  is  found  in \nbus~ing \n-\nan  affidavit.  bv  the  City  Director  of  Traffic  Engineering. \nHi~ \n. \nNtatementis  bascd  on  the  exaggerated  bus  estimatc  prepared  by \nthe  Board  and  rejected  by  the  District  Court.

I t   reveals  that  the \n~lIbshllltial \ntot a 1 cstiJllH ted  ber  of  automobile  trips  per  day  in  Charlotte \nIlUIIl \nand  Mecklenburg'  County  (not  including  internal  truck  trips)  is \nS(i!l,604.  That  the  13S  additional  busses  would  gravely  aggravate \nthe  congestion  is  dubious,  to  say  the  least. \nThe  District  ,fudge  rejeeted  the  Board's  inflated  claims,  and \n5 \nfoulld  that  altogether  the  Finger  plan  would  bus  13,300  new  stu \ndents  ill  138  ndditiolllli  busses.  The  Board  had  estimated  that \n11),285  additional  pupils  would  have  to  be  transported,  requiring \n422  addit.ional  busses.  Tlds  estimate  is  disproportionate  on  its \nf<lce,  for  presently  23,600  pupils  are  trflnsported  in  280  busses. \nAs  indicated  above,  the  direct  bus  routes  envisioned  by  the  Finger \nrlml  should  Ilccomp1ish  increased,  not  diminished,  efficiency.  The \ncourt  below,  after  close  analysis,  discounted  the  Board's  estimate \nfor  other  reaSOIlH  as  well,  including  the  \"very  short  measurements\" \nused  by  the  Board  in  determining  who  would  have  to  be  bussed, \nthe  failure  of  the  Board  to  for  staggering  of \n<II~COUllt  round·trip~, \nopening  ilnd  closing  hours,  and  overloads. \n• \n\n208a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated \nMay  26,  1970 \nThe  lower  courts  were  to  have  \"a  practical  flexibility  in \nshaping  •  •  remedies.\"  349  U.S.  at  300.  Thus,  in  sub \nII \nsuming  these  cases  under  traditional  equity  principles, \nthe  Supreme  Court  brought  the  desegregation  decree \nwithin  the  rule  that  to  be  overturned  it  \"must  [be]  demon \nstrate[d]  that  there  was  no  reasonable  basis  for  the \nDistrict  Judge's  decision.\"  United  States  v.  tV.  T.  Grant \nCo.,  345  U.S.  629,  634  (1953).  This  court  has  paid  homage \nto  this  maxim  of  appellate  review  when,  in  the  past,  a \ndistrict  Judge  has  ordered  less  than  comprehensive  relief. \nBradley  v.

What  is  called \nfor here  is  simila  deference  to  an  order  that would  finally \nt' \ninter  the  dual  system  and  not  preserve  a  nettlesome \nresidue.  As  the  Supreme  Court  made  clear  in  Greett, \nsupra,  those  who  would  challenge  an  effective  course  of \naction  bear  a  \"heavy  burden.\"  The  Finger  plan  is  a  re \nmarkably  economical  scheme  when  viewed  in  the  light  of \nwhat  it  accomplishes.  There  has  been  no  showing  that  it \ncan  be  improved  or  replaced  by  better  or  more  palatable \nmeans.

The  \"Illegal\"  Objective  of the  Plan \nMy  Brother  Bryan  expresses  concern  about  the  plan, \nregardless  of  cost,  because  it  undertakes,  in  his  view,  an \nillegal  objective:  \"achieving  racial  balance.\"  Whatever \nmight be  said for  this  view abstractly or in  another context, \nit  is  not  pertinent  here.

Unless  we \nare  to  palter  with  words,  desegregation  necessarily  entails \nintegration,  that  is  to  say  integration  in  some  substantial \ndegree.  The  dictum  to  the  contrary  in  Briggs  v.  Ell'iotl .. \n132 F. Supp. 776  (E.D.S.C.  1955), was  rejected by necessary \nimplication  by  the  Supreme  Court  ill  Green,  supra,  and \nexplicitly  by  this  court  in  Walker  v.  CO'l/.'uty  School  BOQ1'd \nof Bru.nswick  Co.,  413  F.2d  53,54  n.2  (4th  Cir.  1969). \nAs  my  Bl'other  ·Winter  shows,  there  is  no  more  suitable \nway  of achieving  this  task  than  by setting,  at least initially, \na  ratio  roughly approximating that of the  racial  population \nin  the  school  system.  The  District  Judge  adopted  this  ad \nhoc  measurement  as  a  starting guide,  expressed  a  willing \nness  to  accept a  degree  of modification,G  and  departed  from \nit where  circumstances  required. \nB.  The  \"Um'easonableness\"  of  the  Plan \nThe  majority  does  not  quarrel  with  the  plan's  objective, \nnor,  accept.ing  the  findings  of  t.he  District  Court,  does  it \nreally  dispute  that  the  plan  can  be  achieved.  Rather,  we \nare  told,  the  plan  is  an  unreasonahle  burden. \nThe  District  .J udge  wrote  in  his  Deccmber  1  order  that \nG \nFixed  ratios  of  pupils  in  particular  schools  will  not  be  set. \nH  the  board  in  one  of  its  three  tries  had  presented  a  plan \nfor  desegregatioll,  the  court  would  have  sought  ways  to  ap \npl\"Ove  varilltions  in  pupil  ratios.  In  llefault  of  allY  sueh  plan \nfrom  the  school  board,  the  court  will  start  with  the  thought, \norigillally advllnced  in  the ordr.r  of April  23,  that  should \neffort~ \nbe  made  to  reach  a  71-29  ratio  in  the  various  schools  so  t.hat \nthere  will  be  no  basis  for  cOlltending  that one  school  is  racially \ndiffcrcnt  from  the  others,  but  to  understaud  that  yariations \nfrom  that  norm  may  be  unavoidable. \n\n210a \nOpinio'Jls  of  Court  of  Al)peals  dated  May \n26. .  1970 \nThis  notion  must  be  emphatically  rejected.  At  bottom \nit  is  no  morc  than  an  abstract,  unexplicated  judgment  a \nconclusion  of  the  majority  that,  all  things  considered,  de \nsegregation  of  this  school  system  is  not  worth  the  price. \nThis  is  a  conclusion  neither  nor  school  boards  are  per \nwe \nmitted  to  make. \nIn  making  policy  decisions  that  nrc  not  constitutionally \ndictated,  state  authorities  are  free  to  decide  in  their  dis \ncretion  that a  proposed  measure  is  worth  the  cost  involved \nor  that  the  cost  is  ullreasonablf!,  and  accordingly  they  may \nadopt or reject the proposal.  This  is not.  such a  case.  Vindi \ncation  of  the  plaintiffs'  constitutional  right  docs  not  rest \nin  the  school  board's  discI'etion,  as  the  Supreme  Court \nauthoritatively decided  rsixteen  years  ago  and  has  repeated \nwith  increasing  emphasis.  I t  is  not  for  the  Board  or  this \ncourt  to  say  that  the  cost  of  compliance  with  Bt·ow'n  is \n\"unreasonable.\" \nThat  a  subjective  assessment  is  the  operational  part  of \nthe new  doctrine  is highlighted  by a  study \n\"reasonabIcne~s\" \nof  the  factors  the  majority  bids  school  boards  take  into \naccount  in  making  bussing  neterminatiolls.  \"[A]  school \nboard  should  take  into  consideration  the  age  of  the  pupils, \nthe distance  and  time requireil  for transportation, the  effect \ntraffic,  and the cost in  relation  t.o  the board's  resources.\" \n011 \nBut,  as  we  have  seen,  diRtance  and  time  will  be  compara \ntively short, the effect on traffic is  llndemon!'!.tfl.1ted,  tbe incre \nmental  cost  is  marginal.  As  far  as  age  is  concerned,  it has \nnever  prevented  the  bussiTlg  of  pupils  in  Charlotte-1fcck \nlenburg,  or  in  North  Carolina  generally,  where  70.9%  of \nall  bussed  students  are  elementary  pupils. \nI f  the transportation of elementary  pupils were  a  novelty \nsought  to  be  introduced  by  the  District  Court,  I  could \nunderstand  my brethren's  reluctance.  But,  as  is  conceded, \n\n211a \nOpinio11S  of  Court  of \nApllea1s  dated  May  1970 \n26~ \nbussing  of  children  of  elementary  school  age  is  an  estab \nlished  tradition.  Bussing  has  long  been  used  to  perpetuate \ndual  systems. 7  More  importantly,  bussing  is  a  recognized \neducational  tool  in  Charlotte-nJecklenbnrg and  North  Caro \nlina.  And  as  the  National  Education  Association  has  ad \nmirably  demonstrated  in  it.s  brief,  bussing  has  playcd  a \ncrucial  J'ole  in  the  evolution  from  the  one-room  schoolhouse \nin  this nation.  Since  the  majorit.y  accepts  the  leh.;.timacy  of \nbussing,  today's  decision  totally  baffles  rue. \nIn  the  final  analysis,  the  elementary  pupil  phase  of  the \nFinger plan  is disapproved because  the  percentage  increase \nin  hussing  is  somehow  determined  to  he  too  onerous,8  Why \nthis  is  so  we  are  not  told.  The  Board  plan  itself  would  bus \n5,000  additional  pupils.  The  fact  remains  that  in  North \nCarolina  55%  of  all  pupils  aJ'e  now  being  bussed.  Under \nthe  Fingcl'  pJalL  approximately 47%  of  the  Charlotte-Meck \nlenburg  student  population  would  be  bussed.  This  is  well \nwithin  the  existing  percentage  throughout  the  state. \nThe  majority's  proposal  is  inherently  ambiguous.  The \nFor  some  extreme  examples,  see:  School  Board  of  Warren \n7 \nCounty  v.  Kelly,  F.2d  Cir.  ]  Corbin  v.

Sec  also,  Chambers  v.  Ircdell  Co.,  F.2d  (4th \nCir.1970)  (dissenting  opinion). \nThe  Illlljority  calculates  the  clementary  school  portion  of  the \n8 \nplan  to  mean  a  39%  increase  in  bussed  pupils,  32%  increase  in \nbusses;  the  whole  package,  it  is  said,  would  require  a  56%  pupil \nincrease  alld  49%  bus  increase. \nThese  figures  are  accurate  but  do  not  tell  the  whole  story.  I f  \none  inelndes  within  the  number  of  students  presently  being  trans \nported  those  t.hat  are  bussed  on  commercial  lines  (5000),  the  in· \ncrease  in  pupils  transported  would  1I0t  appear  to  be  as  large. \nThus  the  plan  for  elementary  schools  would  entail  a  33%  bussed \npupil  increment,  the  whole  Finger  plan,  47%. \n\n212a \nOpinions  of  Court.  of  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nAl)1}(~als \ncourt-ordered  plan  is  said  to  he  unreasonable.  Yet  the \nSchool  Board's  own  plan  has  also  heen  disapproved.  Does \nthe decision  ·that the  Finger plan  is  unreasonable  depend \non  the  premise  that  an  in termediate  course  is  available 1 \n'\\Vould  the  amount  of  segregation  J'etained  in  the  School \nBoard's  plan  be  avowedly  sanctioned  if  it  were  recognized \nthat  nothing  short  of  the  steps  delineated  in  the  District \nCourt's  plan  will  suffice  to  eliminate  it'  Since  there  is  no \npracticable  alternative,  mnst  we  assume  that  the  majority \nis  willing  to  tolerate  the  lleficiencies  in  the  Board  plan' \nThese quest.ions  remain unresolved  and  thus  the  ultimate \nmeaning of the \"J'easonableness\"  doctrine is undefined.  Suf \nfice  it  t.o  say  that  this  case  is  not  un  appropriate  one  in \nwhich  to  grapple  with  the  theoretical  issue  whether  the \nlaw  can  endure  a  slight  but  irreducible  remnant  of  segre \ngated  schools.  This  record  presents  no  such  problem.  The \nremnant  of  racially  identifiable  elementary  schools,  t.o \nwhich the District Court addressed  itself,  encompasses  over \nbalf the  elementary  population.  This  large  fraction  cannot \nbe  called  slight;  nor,  as  Finger  plan  demonstrates,  is \ntll(~ \nit \nirreducible. \nI  am  even  more  convinced  of  the  unwisdom  of  reaching \nout  to  fashion  a  new  \"rule  of  reason,\"  when  this  record  is \nfar  from  requiring  it,  because  of  the  serious  consequences \nit would  portend  for  the  general  course  of  school  desegre \ngation.  Handed  a  new litigable  issue  the  so-called  reason \nableness  of a  proposed plan  school  hoards can  be  expected \nto  exploit  it  to  the  hilt.  The  concept  is  highly  susceptible \nto  delaying  tactics  in  the  courts.  Everyone  can  advance  a \ndifferent opinion  of what is  reasonable.  Thus,  rarely  would \nit  be  possible  to  make  expeditious  disposition  of  a  boarel's \nclaim  that its  segregated  system  is  not  \"reasonably\"  eradi \ncable.  Even  more  pernicious,  the  new-born  rule  furnishes \na  powerful  incentive  to  communities  to  perpetuate  and \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - -\n213a \nOphli011S  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  MaV \n26,  1970 \ndeepcll  the  effects  of  race  separatioll  so  that,  when  chal \nlenged,  they can  protest that belated  remedial  action  would \nbe  unduly  burdensome. \nMoreover,  the  opinion  catapults  us  back  to  the  time, \nthought  passed,  when  it  was  the  fashion  to  contend  that \nthe  inquiry  was  not how  much  progress  had  been  made  but \nthe  presence  or  absence  of  good  faith  on  the  part  of  the \nhoard.  Whether  an  \"intractable  remnant  of  segregation\" \ncan  be  allowed  to  persist,  apparently  will  now  depend  in \nlarge  measure  on  a  slippery  test:  an  estimate  of  whether \nthe  Board  has  made  \"every  reasonable  effort  to  integrate \nthe  pupils  under  its  contro1.719 \n_Tn.

He  found  it  un \nbul'l:'~ \nllecessary  lit  that  time  to  decide  whether  the  Board  had  deliber \nately gerrymandered  to  perpetuate the dual system  since  he  believed \nt.hat  the  court  order  to  follow  would  promote  substantial  changes. \nThe  Board  wns  given  nntil  May  15  to  devise  a  plan  eliminating \nfaculty  and  student  segregation. \nA  majority  of  the  Board  voted  not  to  take  an  immediate  appeal \nand  the  school  superintendent was  directed  to  prepare  plan.  His \nII. \nmandate  was  hazy.  According  to  the  court  below-\nNo  express  guidel ines  were  given  the  superintendent.  How \never,  the  views  of  many  members  expressed  at  the  meeting \nwet'e  so  opposed  to  serious  and  substantial  desegregation  that \neveryone  including  the  superintendent  could  reasonably  have \nconcluded,  as  the  court  does,  that  a  \"minimal\"  plan  was  what \nwas  callcd  for,  and  that  the  \"pIau\"  was  essentially  a  prelude \nto  ant.icipnted  disnpproval  and  appeal. \n• \n•  •  •  • \nThe  staff  were  llever  directed  to  do  any  serious  work  on  re \ndrawillg  of  f;chool  zone  lines,  pairing  of  schools,  combining \nzones,  grouping  of  schools,  cOllferences  with  the  Department \nof  Hr.alth,  Education  and  Welfare,  nor  any  of  the  other \n\n214a \nOpinio'ns  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1.970 \nThe  Supreme  Court  having  barred  further  delay  its \nby \ninsistent  emphasis  on  an  immediate  remedy,  we  should  not \nlend  ourselves  to  the creation  of  a  new  loophole  by  attenu \nating  the  substance  of desegregation. \npossible  methods  of  making  real  progress  towards  desegre-• \n• \ngabon. \nThe  superintendent's  plan  was  submitted  to  the  Board  on  May  8. \nI t  was  quite  modest  in  its  undertaking.  Nevertheless,  tll8  Board \n\"struck  out  virtually  all  the  effective  provisions  of  the  superin \nplan.\"  The  pIau  ultimately  filed  by  the  Board  on  May \ntendent'~ \n28  was  \"the  plan  pre. ... iously  found  racially  discriminatory  with \nthe  addition  of  one  element  the  provision  of  transportation  for \n[majority  to  minority  transfers.]\"  The  Board  also  added  a  rule \nmaking  a  student  who  transfers  to  a  new  high  school  ineligible  for \nathletics  for  year.  As  the  District  .Judge  found, \nII \n[t] he  effect  of  the  uth letie  penalty  is  obvious  it  discriminates \nagainst  black  students  who  may  want  to  transfer  and  take \npart  in  sports,  and  is  no  penalty  white  students  who  sllOw \n011 \nno  desire  for  such  transfers. \nIn  the  meantime  the  Boal'd  for  the  first  time  refused  to  accept \na  recommendatioll  of  the  superintendent  for  the  promotion  of  a \nteacher  to  priJlcipal.  The  reason  avowed  was  that  the  teacher, \nwho  was  black  and  a  plaintiff  in  the  suit,  had  publicly  expressed \nhis  agreement  with  the  District  Court  order.  The  job  was  with \nheld  until  the  prospective  appointee  signed  a  \"loyalty  oath.\" \nThe  District  Judge  held  a  hearing  June  ]6  and  ruled  on \n011 \n.Julle  20.  He  dediut'd  to  find  the  Board  in  contempt  but  did  note \nthat  \"[ t] he  board  does  not  adm it  nor  claim  that  it  has  any \npositive  duty  to  promote  desegregation.\"  The  .Tudge  also  re \ntumed  to  the  issue  of  gerrymandering  and  fOllnd  \"a long  standing \npolicy  of  control  over  the  makeup  of  school  population  which \nscare·ely  fits  any  true  'neighborhood  school  philosophy.''' \nOn  July  29,  the  Board  returned  with  a  new  plan.  The  District \nJudge  was  pleased  to  learn  that  \"the  School  Board  has  reversed \nits  field  and  has  accepted  its  affirmative  constitutional  duty  to \ndesegregate  pupils,  teachers,  principals  and  staff  members  'at  the \nearliest  possible  date'\"  In  view  of  this  declaration  and  of  the \nlate  date,  the  court  \"reluctalltly\"  approved  for  one  year  only  a \nplan  whereby  all  blul;k  inner-city  schools  would  be  closed \nsevell \nand  a  total  of  4245  black  children  bussed  to  outlying  white  schools. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n215n. \nOpi'ni011S  of  C01/rt  of  Apl)eals  dated  May  2(j, \n1970 \nAlbert V.

(Accent  added.) \n\"[A]chieving  integration\"  is  the  phraseology  used,  but \nactually,  achieving  racial  balance  is  the  objective.  Bussing \n-\n_. \n. \n\" \nThe  B01!ru  was  direeteu  to  file  a  plan  for  complete  dsegregation  in \nNovember. \nBy  November,  the  District  Judge  was  Ilble  to  survey  the  results \nachieved  under  t.he  plan  adopted  for  the  year.  He  found  that \n\"ollly  1315  insteud  of  the  promised  4245  black  pupils\"  had  been \ntransferred.  (Laler  information  revealed  that  the  number  was \nonly  767.)  Furthermore,  he  fOlilld  that \nThe  Board  hilS  indicated  thnt  its  members  do  not  accept  the \nduty  to  desegregate  the  schools  at  any  ascertainable  time; \nand  they  have  clearly  indiclited  that  they  intend  not  to  do  it \neffective  in  the  fall  of  1970.  They  have  also  demonstrated  a \nyawning'  gap  between  predictions  and  pel'formllllce. \nOn  November  17,  the  Board  filed  a  plan.  It  \"discarded  further \nconsideratioll  of  pairing,  grouping,  clustering  and  transporting.\" \nOstel.lsibly  \"to  \\'oid  'tipping,'\"  the  provided  that  \",hite \nplHn \nII \nstudents  would  not  be  assigned  schools  where  they  would  find  them \nselves  with  less  than  60%  whites.  This  WIlS,  as  the  District  Court \nfOlwd,  a  one-way  street  in  view  of  the  fact  tllat  the  plan  contem \npJllted  no  effort  to  desegregate  school'!  with  greater  than  40% \nblack.,;.  The  plan  also  dropped  the  earlier  provision  of  transporta \ntion  for  students  transferring  out  of  segregated  situations.  Thus \nthe  Board  nullified  the  one  improvement  it  had  made  in  its  May  8 \nplan.  I t   also  left  t.hose  black  st.udents  who  had  transferred  to \noutlying  schools  pursuant  to  the  July  29  plan  without  transporta \ntion.  Understandably,  the  court  labeled  t.his  \"re-segregation.\" \nIn  t.he  face  of  this  total  lack  of  cooperation  on  t.he  part  of  the \nBoard,  the  court  was  com pelled  to  appoint  an  expert  to  devise  a \nplan  for  desegregation.  The  Finger  plan  was  the  result. \nIt  appears  from  the  record  that  all  most  issues  the  Board  was \nsharply  divided.  Of  course  I  mean  to  cast  no  Ilspersions  on  those \nmembers  and  there  were  some  who  Ul'ged  the  Board  forthrightly \nto  shoulder  its  duty.  But  the  above  recital  of  events  demonstrates \nbeyond  doubt  that  this  Board,  through  a  majority  of  its  members, \nfar  frol1l  making  \"every  reasonable  effort\"  to  fulfill  its  constitu \ntional  obligation,  has  resisted  and  delayed  desegregation  at  every \nturn. \n\n216a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nto  prevent  racial  imbalance  is  not  as  yet  a  Constitutional \nobligation.  Therefore, no  matter the  prior or present utiliz \nation  of  bussing  for  this  other  reasons,  and  regardless \n01' \nof  cost  considerations  or  duplication  of  t.he  bus  routes,  I \nthink  the  injullction  call1lot  stand. \nWithout  Constitutional  origin,  no  power  exists  in  the \nFederal  courts  to  order  the  Board  to  do  or  not  to  do  any \nthing.  I  read  no  authority  in  the  Constitution,  or  in  the \nimplications  of  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education,  347  US  483 \n(1954),  and  its  derivatives,  requiring  the  authorities  to \nendeavor  to  apportion  the  school  bodies  in  the  racial  ratio \nof  the  whole  school  system. \nThe  majority  opinion  presupposes  this  racial  balance, \nand  also  bussing  to  achieve  it,  as  Constitutional  impera \ntives,  but  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  United  States  has  re \ncently  suggested  inquiry  on  whether  \"any  particular  racial \nbalance  must be  achieved  in  the  schools;  , . .

West  Feliciana \nSchool Board,.  ' U.  S.  (1970)  ; Alexander v.  Hol'mes \nu. \nS. \nCo·unty  Bd.  of Ed.,  (1969)  ;  Green v.  School \nBd.  of New  Kent  County, 391  U.  S.  430  (1968),  and Monroe \nv.  Bd.  of Cornrn.'rs.,  391  U.  S.  450  (1968),  the  majority con \ncludes  that  the  existing  high  school  and  junior  high  school \nsystem must  be dismantled  and  that the  constitutional  man \ndate  can  be  met  by  the  use  of geographical  assignment,  in \ncluding  satellite  districts  and  busing. \nThe  majority  thus  holds  that  the  Constitution  requires \nI t  \nthat  this  dual  system  be  dismantled.  indicates  its  recog \nnition  of  the  need  to  overcome  the  discriminatory  educa \nIt \ntioual  effect  of  such  factors  as  residential  segregation. \nalso  approves  the  use  of  zones,  satellite  districts  and  re \nsultant  busing  for  the  achievement  of  a  unitary  system  at \nthe  high  school and  junior high  school  levels.  Nevertheless, \nthe  majority  disapproves  a  similar  plan  for  the  desegrega \ntion of the elementary schools  on  the ground that the busing \ninvolved  is  too  onerous.  I  believe  that  this  ground  is  in \nsubstantial  and  untenable. \nAt  the  outset,  it is well  to  remember  the  seminal  declara \nu. \ntion in Brown v.  Board  of Education  (Brown  II),  349  S. \n294,  300  (1955),  that in cases of  this  nature  trial  courts  are \nto  \"be  guided  by  equitable  principles\"  in  \"fashioning  and \neffectuating  decrees.\"  Since  Brown  II  the  course  of  deci \nsion  has not departed from  the underlying premise that this \nis  an  equitable  proceeding,  and  that the  district court is in \nvested  with  broad  discretion  to  frame  a  remedy  for  the \nwrongful  acts  which  the  majority  agrees  have  heen  com \nmitted.  In  Green  v.  School  Board  of  New  Kent  County, \n391  U.  S.  at  438,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  district \ncourts  not  only  have  the  \"power\"  but  the  \"duty  to  render \na  decree  which  will,  so  far  as  possible,  eliminate  the  dis-\n\n. \n-\n• \n219a \nOpi-nions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \ncriminatory  offects  of  the  past,  as  wen  as  bar like  discrimi \nnation  in  the  future.\"  District courts  were  directed  to  \"re \ntain  jurisdict.ion  until  it  is  clear  that  disestablishment  has \nBoard  U.

S.  218,  233  (1964).  Thus,  the  Supreme  Court  bas  made \nit  abundantly  cloar  that  the  district  courts  have  the  power, \nwen, \nand the duty  as  to fashion  equitable  remedies  designed \nto  C'xti rpa te  racial  segregation  in  t.he  hlic  schools.  And \npH \nill  fash ion ing  e'luita hIe  reI ief,  the  decree  of  a  district  court \nmust  be  sustained  unless  it  constitutes  a  clear  abuse  of \ntliscretion.  Um:ted  States  v.  W . .T .  Grant  Co ..  345  U.  S.  619 \n• \n(1953) . \nBusing  is  among  the  panoply of  devices  which  a  court  of \nequity  may  employ  in  fashiolling  an  equitable  remedy  in  a \ncase  of  this  type.  The  district  courf.'s  order  required  that \n\"transportatiOll  be  offered  on  a  uniform  llon-racial  basis \nto  al1  children  whose  attendance  in  any  school  is  necessary \nto  bring  about  reduction  of  segregation,  and  who  lives  far \nther  f\"om  t.he  school  to  which  t.hey  are  assigned  than  the \nIt \nBoard  determines  to  be  walking  distance.\"  found  as  a \nfact,  and  I  accept  its  finding,  that  \"thel'c  is  no  way\"  to  de \nsegregate  the  Charlotte  schools  in  the  heart  of  the  black \ncommunity  without  providing'  such  transportation. \nThe district. court's order is  neither  a  substantial  advance \n110r  extension  of  present  policy,  110r  on  this  record  does  it \nconstitute  an  nhnse  of  discretion.  This  school  system,  like \nmany  others,  is  actively  engaged  in  the  business  of \n110W \ntransporting  students  to  school.  Indeed,  busing  is  a  wide \nspread  practice  in  the  United  States.  U.  S.

Between  1954  and  1967  the number  of  pupils  using \nschool  transportation  has  increased  from  9,509,699  to \n17,271,718.  National  Education  Association,  National Com \nmission  on  Safety  Education,  Statistics  on  Pupil \n1967-68 \nTransportat·ion  3. \nGiven  its  widespread  adoption  in  American  education,  it \nis  not  surprising  that  busing  bas  been  held  an  acceptable \ntool for  dismantling a  dual  school  system.  In United  States \nv.  Jefferson  Coulnty  Board  of  Education,  380  F.2d  385,  392 \ncert.  den.  Parrish \n(5  Cir.)  (en  banc),  sub.  nom.  Caddo \nEd.  U'1Z4ted  States, \nSchool  v.  389  U.  S.  840  (1967),  the  court \nordered  that  bus  service  which  was  \"generally  provided\" \nmust  be  routed  so  as  to  transport  every  student  \"to  the \nschool  to  which  he  is  assigned\"  provided  that  the  school \n\"is  sufficiently  distant  from  his  home  to  make  him  eligible \n• \nfor  transportation  under  generally  applicable  transporta-\ntion  rules.\"  Similarly,  in  United  States  v.  School  Dist.  151, \n286  F.  S.  786,  799  (N.D.  TIL  1968),  aff'd.,  404- F.2d  1125  (7 \nCir. 1968),  the  court said  that  remedying the  effects  of past \ndiscrimination  required  giving consideration  to  \"racial fac \ntors\" in  such matters as \"assigning students\" and providing \ntransportation  of  pupils.  In  addition,  the  Eighth  Circuit \nin  Kemp  v.  Beasley,  F.2d  (8  Cir.  1970),  recog \nnized  that  busing  is  \"one  possible  tool  in  the  implementa \ntion  of  unitary  schools.\"  And,  finally,  Griffin  v.  School \nBoard,  S'upra,  makes  it clear  that  the  added  cost  of  neces \nsary transportation  does  not  render a  plan objectionable. \nI  turn,  then,  to  the  extent  and  effect  of  busing  of  ele \nmentary  school  students  as  ordered  by  the  district  court. \nPresently,  23,600  students- .217'0  of the  total school  popu \nlation ..  are  bused,  excluding  some  5,000  pupils  who  travel \nto  and  from  school  by  public  transportation.  The  school \n\n• \n221a \nOpi-llions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \nboard  operates  280  buses.  The  average  cost  of  busing  stu \ndents  is  $39.92  per  student,  of  which  one-half  is  borne  by \nthe  state  and  one-half \"by  the  board.  Thus,  the  average an \nBual cost to  the  boa1'd  is  about $20.00  pel'  student.  The total \nanllual  cost  to  the  board  for  busing  is  approximately \n$500,000.00 out of a  total operating budget of $51,000,000.00. \n% \nThe cost  of  busing is  thus less  than  1  of the  total  operat-\n\" \ning  budget.  and  an  even  smaller  percentage  of  the \n$57,700,000.00  which  this  school  district  expends  on  the \naggregate of operations,  capital outlay and debt service and \n2% \nthis  cost  also  represents  less  than  of  the  local  funds \nwhich  together  with  state and  federal  money constitute  the \nrevenue  available  annually  to  the  school  board. \nThe  total  number  of  elementary  school  pupils  presently \nbused  does  not  appear,  but  under  the  district  court's  order \nan  additional  9,300  elementary  school  pupils  would  be \nbused.  The  additional operating cost of busing  them  would \nnot  exceed  $1813,000.00  per  year.  They  ,Iiould  require  not \nmore  than  90  additional  bllses,  and  the  buses would  require \nan  addi tional  capital  outlay  of  $486,000.00.  The  increased \noperating  cost  of  the  additional  elementary  school  pupils \nrequired to  be bused  amounts  to less  than 170  of the board's \nschool  budget,  and  the  one·time  capital  outlays  for  addi \n% \ntional  buses  amo1111ts  to  less  than  1  of  the  board's  total \nbudget.  The  combined  operational  alld  capital  cost  repre \nsents less th[\\111.2%  of the board's total budget.  I  am, there \nfore,  unable  to  see  how  the  majority  could  consider  the \naddit.ional  cost  unbearable. \nPerhaps  mOre  importmltly,  the  tender  years  of  ele \nmentary  school  students  requires  a  consideration  of  the \n• \nimpact  of  the  dist.rict  court's  order  on  the  average  student. \nWhile  this  hoard  transports  21%  of  the  total  school  popu \nlation,  it  is  providing  transportation  to  a  far  lower  per-\n\n, \n222a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  May \n26,  1970 \ncentage  of  pupils  than  the  average  North  Carolina  school \nboard.  In  North  Carolina  54.970  of  the  average  daily  at \ntendance  in  the  public  schools  was  transported  by  bus  dur \ning  the  1968-69  school  year. \nThe  average  distance  traveled  by  elementary  school  pu \npils  presently  bused  does  not  appear,  but  thc  district court \nfound  overall  with  respect  to  the  children  required  to  be \nbused  by  its  order  that  they  \"will  lIot  as  a  group  travel  as \nfar,  nor  will  they  experience  more  inconvenience  than  the \nmore  than  28,000  children  who  are  already  being  trans \nported  \"While  the  district  court  did  not  make \nsep~ \n0  0  0.\" \narate  findings  with  regard  to  the  average  length  of  travel \nfor  the  additional  elementary  school  pupils  required  to  be \nbused,  it  did  -find  that  the  average  oIlc-way  bus  trip  in  the \nsystem  today  is  over  15  miles  in  length  and  takes  nearly \nan  hour  and  a  quarter.  In  contrast.,  the  court  found  that \nunder  its  plan  the  average  one-way  trip  for  elementary \nschool  students  would  be  less  thAn  7  miles  and  would \nre~ \nquire  not over  thirty-five  minutes. \nWhen  I  consider  that busing has been widely used in  this \nsystem  to  perpetuate  segregation,  that  some  busing  was \nproposed  even  under  the  unacceptable  board  pla.ns,  that \nthe  cost  of  additiona.l  busing  to  the  system  as  required  by \nthe  court's  order,  both  i11  absolute  terms  and  in  relation  to \nits  total expenditures is  so  minimal,  and  that the  impact on \nthe  elementary  school  pupils  is  so  slight,  I  discern no basis \nfor  concluding  that  the  district  court  abused  its  discretion \nwith  respect  to  the  elementary  school. \nTwo  other  aspects  of  the  majority's  opinion  require  my \ncomment. \nFirst,  the  majority  attempts  to  answer  the  query  of  the \nChief Justice in  his separate opinion  in  Northcross  v.  Board \n\n-\n• \n• \n223a \nMay \nOpill'ions  of  of  Appeals  dated  1970 \nCou,rt  26, \nof  Ed.  of  .Memphis,  U.  S.  (1970),  as  to  whether \n\"any  particular  racial  balance  must  be  achieved  ill  the \nschools\"  by  lJOlcling  \"that  not  every  school  in  nnitary \nR \nsystem  need  be  integrated'\"  •  \"'.\"  To  me,  the  hold \n~chool \ning  is  prematme  and  unwise.  There  is  not  in  this  case \neither  t.he  intractable  problem  of  a  vast.  urban  ghett.o  in  a \nlarge  or  substantial  basis  on  which  it  may  he  said \ncit~,  allY \nthat  the  cost  or  the  impact  the  system  or  the  pupils \n011  011 \nof dismantling  the  dual  system is  insupportable. \nThe  district  court  wisely  attempted  to  remedy  the  pres \nent  dunl  systelll  by  requiring  that  pupil  assignment  be \nbased  \"as  ncarly  as  practicahle\"  the  racial  composition \n011 \n% \nof  the  school  system,  71  wllite  and  29%  black.  The  plan \nordered  fell  short.  of  complete  reali;-:utioll  of  this  remedial \ngoal.  While  individual  schools  will  vary  in  racial  composi \n% \n370 \ntion  from  to  41  hlack,  most  schools  will  he  clust.ered \nIt \na  the  enti re  system's  overall  racial  mt.io.  would \nI'cllUld \nv \nseem  to  follow  from  United States  v.  Board  of \nil1ontgomc'ry \nEducatinu.  :395  U.  225,  232  (19G8),  that  the  district \n~. \ncourt's  ut.ilizatiOll  of  racial  ratios  to  dismantle  this  dual \nsystem  and  remedy  tho  effects  of  segregation  was  at  least \nwell  within  t,ile  range  of  its  discretion.  There  the  Supreme \nConrt  approved  as  a  requirement  of  faculty  integration \nt.hat  \"in  each  school  the  ratio  of  whit.e  to  Negro  faculty \nmembers  is  substantially  the  same  as  it  is  throughout  t.he \nsystem.\"  It.  did  so  recogllizing  that  it  had  pro\\'iously  said \nill  New  Kent,  391  D.  S.  at  439,  \"[t]bero  is  no  uni \nCowLf.y-, \nversal  answor  to  complex  problems  of desegregation;  thero \nis  obviously  no  one  plan  that  will  do  the  job  in  every  ease. \nThe  matter  must  bo  assessed  in  light  of  the  circumstances \npresent  and  the  options  available  in  each  instance.\"  I f  ill \na  proper  case  strict  application  of  a  ratio  is  an  approved \ndevice  to  achieve  facult.y  integration,  I  know  of  no  reason \n\n22 \n224a \nOpinions  of  Court  of  Appeals  dat.ed  May \n26,  1970 \nwhy  the same should not be  true to achieve pupil integration, \nespecially  where,  as  here,  Home  wide  deviations  from  the \noverall  ratio  have  been  permitted  to  accommodate  circum \nstances  witb  respect  to  particular schools. \nIn  addition  to  Mont.gom.ery,  the  same  conclusion  can  be \ndeduced  from  the  mandate  of  Wes/.  Fel-icimln  and  Holmes \nCounty  to  dismantle  immediately  a  dual  system.  Schools \ncease  to  be  black  or  whit.e  when  each  reflects  the  overall \npupil  racial  balance  of tbe entire  system.  What  imbalances \nmay be  justified after a  unitary system bas  once  been  estab \nlished,  and  what  departures  from  an  overall  pupil  racial \nhalance  may  be  permitted  to  accommodate  special  circum \nstances  in  the  establishment of  a  unitary system,  should  be \ndeveloped  a  case-by-case  hasis  and  the  facts  of  record \n011 \nwbich  each  case  presents. \nThe other aspect of the majority's opinion which  troubles \nme greatly is  its establishment of the test  of reasonableness. \nMy objections  to  t.his  test  do 110t  spring from  any  desire  to \nimpose  1lnreasonable,  irrational  or  onerous  solutions  on \nschool  systems;  I,  too,  seek  \"reasonable\"  means  with  which \nto  achieve  the  constitutionally  required  objective  of  a  uni \ntary  system. \nMy ohjections  are  two-fold. \nFirst,  tbis  is  an  inappropriate  case  in  which  to  establish \nthe  test.  On  this  record  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  hoard \nacted  reasonabl.y   or  that  there  is  an-y viable  solution  to  the \ndismantling of the dual  system other than  the one fashioned \nbv  the  district  court.  Neither  the  board  nor  HEW  has \n-\nsuggested  one.  So  that,  again,  I  think  the  majority  is  pre \nmature in  its pronouncement and I  would  find  no  occasion to \ndiscuss  reasonableness when  there is  no  choice  of  remedies. \nSecond,  tbe  majority sets fortb  no  standards  by  which  to \njlldge  reasonableness  or  unreasonableness.  The  majority \n\n- -\n• \n225a \nMay \nOp'iniOlls  of  Court  of  Appeals  dated  26,  1970 \n• \nappl'o\\-es  the  district  court's  plan  as  to  high  schools  and \njunior  high  schools,  yet  disapproves  as  to  elementary \nschools.  rrhe  only  differences  are  increased  busing  with \nattendant  increased  cost,  time  and  distance.  Tho  majority \nsubjectively  concludes  that  these  costs  arc  too  great  to \npermit  the  enforcement  of  the  constitutional  right  to  a \nunitary  system_  I  would  find  them  neither  prohibitive \n1101' \nBut,  of \nrelatively  disproportionate.  with  the  absence  stan \ndards,  how  are  the  school  boards  or  courts  to  know  what \nplans  are  reasonable?  The  conscientious  board  cannot  de \ntermino  whon  it  is  ill  compliance.  The  dilatory  board  re \nceives  an  open  invitation  to  further  litigation  and  delay. \nFinally,  I  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  \"I'easonableness\" \nhas  more  than  faint  resemblance  to  the  good  faith  test  of \nBt-ow'n  ll.  Tho  13  years  between  Brown 1l and  N eU)  Ken!. \nCounty  amply  demonstrate  that  this  test  did  110t  work. \nUltimately  it  was  required  to  be  rejected  ano  to  ha\\'e  sub \nstituted  for  it  the  absolute  of  \"now\"  and  \"at.  once.\"  The \nmajority  ignol'es  this  lesson  of  history.  I f  a  constitutional \nright  exists,  it  should  be  enforced.  On  this  record  the  con \nstitutional  of  school  pupils  should \nrights  elementary  be \nenforced  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the  district  court, \nbecause  it  is  clear  that  the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its \ndiscretion . \n•J udge  Sobeloff  authorizes  me  to  say  that  he  joins  In \nthese  views. \n\nr - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .. \n226a \nJudgment  of  Court  of  Appeals \ndated  May  26,  1970 \nThis  cause .came  on  to  be  heard  on  the  l'ecord  from  the \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  ·Western  District  of \nNorth  Carolina,  and  was  argued  by  counsel. \nOn  considerat.ion  whereof,  it  is  and \nORDERED  An.JUDGED \nthat  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court  appealed  from, \nin  this  case,  be,  and  the  same  is  hereby,  vacated;  and  the \ncase  is  remanded  to  the  United  States  District  Court  for \nthe  Western  District  of  North  Carolina,  at  Charlotte,  for \nfurther  proceedings. \nJudge  Bryan  joins  Haynsworth,  C. •J  .

Stay Order at 5. In the first sentence, which Judge \nWilkinson omits to quote, the panel recited that “[w]e next consider the likelihood that CMS and the Swann plaintiffs will prevail \non the merits.” In the third sentence, the panel states its conclusion that “CMS and the Swann plaintiffs have met this element,” a \nconclusion that it said it had reached “[a]fter examination of the parties’ memoranda and the relevant case law.” Id. Then in the \nconclusion to its entire opinion, the panel states that, “[i]n sum, the balance of hardships, likelihood of success on appeal, and the \npublic interest favor staying the injunction.” Id. at 6 (emphasis added). \nIn the second sentence, the panel said that the party moving for the stay “need only show grave or serious questions for \nlitigation.” Id. Even assuming that the panel intended, by articulating the “likelihood of success” test in this manner, to raise and \nanswer a question different from “likelihood of success on the merits”-contrary to what it stated-the only reasonable way to \nunderstand this question is as requiring that the plaintiffs raise a “grave” or “serious” question as to whether the district court’s \ninjunction was in error. Thus, even if (despite its contrary statements) the panel concluded only that such a grave question had \nbeen raised, it necessarily reached a preliminary conclusion that the plaintiffs likely will succeed on the merits. \nI am at a loss to understand why Judge Wilkinson would so strain to suggest that the panel did not conclude, as it said it did, that \nthe School Board and the plaintiffs appellants are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the district court’s \ninjunction. He implies, for example, that it is my personal opinion alone that the panel so concluded. See ante at 2-3. And he \ncharacterizes the panel’s stay order as making “only the briefest and most fleeting reference” to its conclusion that a likelihood \nof success on the merits had been proven, as if to suggest that the panel’s short, clearly-stated conclusion of law is not a \nconclusion of law at all because it was clear and brief. Id. If Judge Wilkinson believes that the panel did not conclude as it stated \nor that its conclusion is of no legal import because of its brevity, notwithstanding the panel’s statement that it had reached its \nconclusion “[a]fter examination of the parties’ memoranda and the relevant case law,” then he should forthrightly so state, and \n.  6 \n \n\n \n \nthen explain his reasons for that conclusion. But not even he ultimately denies that the panel did so conclude. And more \nimportantly, not one member of the panel that entered the stay (or one other member of the court as a whole for that matter) \nwrites to agree with Judge Wilkinson’s curiously extra-legal suggestion that the panel really did not mean what it stated in its \nstay order. \n \n \n\t\r  \n \t\r  \n \nEnd\t\r  of\t\r  Document\t\r   ©\t\r  2013\t\r  Thomson\t\r  Reuters.\t\r  No\t\r  claim\t\r  to\t\r  original\t\r  U.S.\t\r  Government\t\r  Works.\t\r  \n \n\t\r  \n  \n.  7 \n ",

The  defendants  have  admitted  their  duty  to \ndesegregate  the  schools;  considerable  progress  has  been \nmade  toward  desegregation  of faculties;  and  progress,  pre \nviously  noted,  lIa::;  been  made  in  some  other  aroas.  The \nschools,  however,  remain  for  the  most  part  unlawfully \nsegregated.  The  facts  supporting  that  concl usion  in  all \nthe  court's  previolls  orders  are  reiterat.ed  here. \nThe  issue  is  what  to  do  punHlant  to  the  board's  latest \nplan,  filed  November  17,  1969.  The  plan  recites  the  follow \ning  ostensible  purpose: \n\"The  Board  of  Education  has  embarked  upon  a  com \nprehensive  program  for  the  pu rpose  of  restructuring \nattendance  lines  involving  all  schools  and  all  students \nsel'ved  by  the  sYBtem.  The  primary  purpose  of  this \nprogram  is  to  achieve  further  desegregation  •  as \n111 \n1;0.\" \nmany  schools  as  possible  '.  • \nThe  plan  says  that  a  computer  analyst  has  been  hired \nto  draw  up  various  theoretical  possible  school  zone  atten \ndance  lines,  and  that  school  personnel,  before  February  1, \n1970,  will  draw  the  aetnal  lines. \nThe  details  of  the  plan  show  that  it contains  no  promise \nnor  likelihood  of  desegregating  the  schools. \nThe  plan  and  the  report  accompanying  it  say  (emphasis \nadded) : \nuN  school district to  which white  students  a·re  assig-ned \n0 \nshould have less  than  60  Pc)'  cent white  student popula \ntion  to  avoid  'tipping.'\"  (Plan,  page  2.) \n•  •  • \nII \n\n- --- -\n. \n94a \nand  Order  dated  December \n1,  1969 \nOpi1~ion \n\"  . . .  it is  the  plan  of  this  School  Board  to  limit  schools \nto  which  white  students  are  assigned  to  those  schools \nin  which  it  is  to  provide  a  student  population \npos~ible \nwhich  is  at  least  60  per cent  white.\"  (Plan,  page  5.) \nco \nQ \n\"In  determining  the  initial  attendance  lines,  the  ratio \nof  black  to  white  students  will  not  exceed  60%  white-\nblack  \\\\THERE  THE  SCHOOL  DESEGREGATED.\" \n4070 \nIS \n(Report,  page  5.) \no \n\"A  \"majority  of  the  Board  of  Ed'ucation  believes  that \nthe  constitutional  requirements  of  desegre.gation  will \nbe  achieved  by  the  of  attendance  lines, \nrestruct~tring \nthe  restricting  freedom  of  transfer,  and  other  provi \nsions  of  this  plan.  The.  majority  of  the  Board  has, \ntherefore,  discarded  further  consideration  of  pairing, \ngrouping,  clustering and transporting.\"  (Plan, page 6.) \nThe  strongest  claim  made  in  the  plan  with  respect  to \nthe  all-black  schools  is  that  among  43  elementary  schools \nin  the  densely  populated  areas  of  Charlotte  it is  ((theoreti \nca.lly  [school  board's  emphasis]  possible  to  populate  these \nschools  with  the  following  ratios  of  black  students:  . . .  \nSeven  (7)  schools  in  which  the  black  student  population \nis  100  pel·  cent.\"  (Plan,  pages  3  and  4.)

Since  the \nboard  has,  in  seven  months,  failed  to  produce  a  program \nfor  desegregation,  it  is  only  natural  that  they  can  not \npredict tbe  effect of any  particular  building project on  such \na  program.  The  court  has  yet  not  received  infOl'mation \nnecessary  to  appraise  the  effects  of  current  building \nactivity  on  the  current  unprogrammed  course  of  desegre \ngation. \nit \nWhen  the  plan  is  understood,  boils  down  to  this: \nI t  \n1.  proposes  to  re-draw  school  zone  lines,  and  to \nrestrict freedom  of choice,  which  the  court had  already \n\n96a \nOpi.nion  and  Order  d.ated \n1,  1.969 \nDece~nber \nadvised  the  board  to  eliminate  except  where  it  would \npromote  desegregation.  I t  states  definable  desegre \n110 \ngation  goals. \n2.  The  \"60-40\"  ratio  is  a  one-way  street.  The  plan \nimplies that there will  be  no  action  to produce  desegre \ngation  in  schools  with  blncJ.:  populations  above  40%, \nand  that  no  white  students  arc  to  be  assigned  to  such \nschools. \n3.  Continued  operation  of  all  seven  of  the  all-black \n\" \nelementary schools  would  be  assure-d.  The  same  would \nappear  to  be  true  for  the  entire  group  of  25  mostly \n\"black\"  schools,  mentioned  in  the  court's  November  7 \norder,  which  serve  16,197  of  the  24,714  black  students \nin  the  system . \n• \n4.  Transportation  to  aid  children  transferring  out \nof  segregated  situations  (which  was  ordered  by  the \ncourt  April  23  as  a  condition  of  any  freedom  of \n011 \ntransfer  plan,  and  which  was  a.  part  of  this  plan  as \nadvertised  in  the  boa,rd's  October  report)  has  been \n29 \neliminated  from  the  plan  as  filed  with  the  court. \nInevitable  effects  of  this  action  would  be  to  violate \nthe  court  order  and  to  leave  the  children  recently  re \nassigned  from  seven  closed  hlack  inner-city  schools \nwith  no  way  to  reach  the  suburban  schools  they  now \nattend!  This  is  re-segregation. \n5.  Other  methods  (pairing,  grouping; clustering  of \nschools)  which could  reduce  or eliminate  segregation. \nand  which  the  board, on October  29  when  i t  was  asking \nfor  a  time  extension,  promised  to  consider  have  now \nbeen  expressly  left  out  of  the  plan. \n6.

'rhe  Court  recalled \nprior  decisions  that  segregation  of  graduate  students  was \nunlawful  because  it  restricted  the  student's  \"ability  to \nstudy,  to  engage  in  discussions  and  exchange  views  with \nother  students,  and,  in  general,  to  learn  his  profession.\" \nThe  Court  said: \n\"Such  considerations  apply  with  added  force  to  chil \ndren  in  grade  and  high  schools.  To  separate  them \nfrom  others  of  similar  age  and  qualifications  solely \nbecause  of  their  race  generates  a  feeling  of  inferiority \nas  to  their  status  in  the  community  that  may  affect \ntheir  hearts  and  minds  in  a  way  unlikely  ever  to  be \nundone.\" \nQuoting  a  lower  court  opinion,  the  Supreme  Court  con \ntinued: \n\"'Segregation  of  white  and  colored  children  in  public \nschools  has  a  detrimental  effect  upon  the  colored  chil \ndren.  The  impact  is  greater  when  it  has  the  sanction \nof  the  law;  for  the  policy  of  separating  the  races  is \nusually  interpreted  as  denoting  the  inferiority  of  the \nNegro group.  A  sense  of inferiority affects t.he  motiva \ntion  of a  child  to  learn.

The  annual  school  bus  cost  per  pupil \ntransported,  including  everything  except  the  original  cost \nof tbe bus, parking arrangements and  certain  local  adminis \ntrative  costs,  for  the  1968-69  year,  was  $19.92.  The  state \nreimburses  the  Charlotte-Afecklenburg  school  system  ap \nproximately  this  $19.92  per  pupil.  The  April  23,  1969,  and \nFebruary  5,  1970,  findings  of  fact  estimated  the  original \ncost  and  periodic  replacement  of  the  busses  themselves  at \nto  to  the \n$18  $20  per  pupil  per  yem·,  which,  added  $19.92, \nresulted  in  the  estimate  of  $40  as  the  total  annual  per \npupil  tnmsportation  cost.  That  estimate  assumed  that  the \nlocal  schools  would  have  to  pay  for  periodic  replacement \nof  busses  as  well  as  for  their  original  purchase.  Since  it \nis  now  cl'?RI'  from  the  deposition  of  D .  .T.  Dark  that  the \nreplacement  of  wom  ont  or  ohsolescent  busses  is  included \nill  the  $19.92  figure,  the  overall  estimate  of  $40  per  pupil \nper  year  is  far  too  high.  Instead  of  a  conti1Hting  annual \nlocal  per  pupil  cost  of  $1S  or  $20  to  supply  and  replace \nbusses,  as  the  court  originally  understood,  the  local  board \nwill  have to  bear only  administrative and  parking expense!';, \nplus  the  original,  one-time  pJ:ll\"chase  of  the  busses.

Although  the  evidence  concerning  the \n5,000  children  currently  transported  by  City  Coach  Lines \nlacks  clarity,  the  court  agrees  with  the  defendant  that  it \nshould not be  inferred  that  they  are  the  source  of payment \nfor  this  transportation,  and  the  court  specifically  corrects \nthe  previous  finding  so  as  to  delete  any  reference  to  the \nsource  of  payment  for  this  transportation. \nIf \n21.  The  school  board's  July  29,  1969  plan  (see  pages \n457 -459  of  the  record  on  appeal)  proposed  the  transfer \nand  transportation  of over  4,200  black  children.  The  court \non  November  7,  1969,  on  the  basis  of  the  then  evidence, \nfound  tbat  the  number  actually  transferred  was  1,315.  The \naffidavit  of  J.  D.  Morgan  dated  February  13,  1970  (para \ngraph  4,  page  770  of  the  record  on  appeal),  indicated  that \nthe  number  of  these  students  being  transported  was  738, \nrequiring  13  busses.  The  findings  of  fact  propospd  by  the \ndefendants  gave the number  as  \"over'  700.\"  The  J.

      "text": "75a \nOrder  dated  October  10,  1969 \nOn  April  2:3,  June  20  and  August  15,  1969,  orders  were \nentered  directing  thc  defendants  to  submit  a  plan  and  a \ntime  t.able  for  the  desegregation  of  the  Charlotte-Mecklen \nburg  schools,  to  be  completed  by  the  fall  of  1970.  Nearly \nsix  months  after  the  original  order,  faculty  desegregation \nis  well  along  and  there  have  been  a  number  of  substantial \nimpl'ovements  in the  stated  policies  of the  Board,  including \nthe  stated  assumpt.ion  of  duty  by  the  Board  to  desegregate \nthe  schoools  \"at.  the  earliest  possible  date.\"  Limited  steps \nhave  been  taken  toward  compliance  with  the  pupil  desegre \ngation  provisions  of  that  original  order.  However,  the \nmajor  part  of  the  job  remains  undone,  and  no  plan  for \ndesegregation  of  the  entire  sy::;tem  has  apparently  been \nvoted  by the  Board. \n011 \nThe  latest  order'  set  November  17,  1969,  as  the  revised \ndate  for  defendants  to  file  a  complete  plan  and  time  tallle. \nDefendants have now filed  a  15-page motion and supporting \naffidavit  asking  the  court  to  extend  anothc,'  two  and \nby \none-half  months,  to  Februa I'y  1,  1970,  the  time  fo\\'  com \npliance  with  the  orders.  Plaintiffs  oppose  the  extension. \nThc  justification  advanced  for  this  dclay  is  that  they \nhave  hired  a  systems  analyst  to  rc-dmw  attendance  lines, \nand  that  the  three  months  between  August  15  and  Novem \nber  17  are  not  enough  time  to  program  a  computer  and \nprepare  a  plan. \nI t  would  be  a  happy  day  if  t.he  job  could  he  turned  over \nto  a  computer.  A  computer,  if  pl'ogmmmed  objectively, \n• \ncould produce objective  results;  all could blame  the machine \n(in  addition  to  the  COUl't)  for  any  unp]easnnt  decisions. \nALso,  the  court  wouLd  like  to  avoid  unnecessary  pressmc \non the  school  staff and  administrators. \nHowever, the information thus far available is inadequate \nto  justify  the  extension.  Computers  are  for  time-sa.ving, \n\n76a \nOrder  dated  October \n10,  1969 \nnot delay.  The computer work was estimated by the Board's \nchosen  systems  analyst,  Mr.  ,\"Veil,  to  require  ninety  man \ndays  of  work.  He  proposes  to  consume  ninety  calendar \ndays  witb  this  job!  The  Board's  motion  says  that  their \ndecisions  about  construction  and  location  of  21  building \nprojects  (involving  mallY  millions  of  dollars)  nre  to  be \nheld  up  pendillg  development  of  the  plan.  The  school  hud \nget  approacbes  fifty  million  dollars.  The  question  fairly \narises  why  the  Board  should  not  employ  or  assign  more \nthau  one person at a  time to  feed  the  computer.  Mr.  Weil's \noriginal  plan,  which  is  in  evidence,  was  prepared  in  a  very \nfew  days.  The  court  has  on  file  also  three  or  four  other \nplans,  including  at  least one  which  local  school  officials  say \nis  educationally  and  technically  feasible,  wbich  were  pre \npared  in  a  few  days  each.  The  use  of  a  computer  does  not \nappear  to  justify  the  delay. \nMoreover,  computers  cannot  make  political  nor  legal  de \ncisions; they react  to  what is  fed  into them; and  the  request \nfor  postponement  leaves  the  court  to  speculate  over  what \nwill  he  fed  into  the  computer.  The  motion  does  not  say \nthat Mr.  Weil  has  becn  instructed  bv  the  Board to  frame  a \n• \nplan  to  desegregate  the  schools;  his  commission,  by  a \nBoard  committee  only,  is  limited  to  re-drawing  attendance \nlines;  the  vague  references  in  the  Board's  motion  to  his \ninstructions  as  to  travel  limitation  and  specified  sehool \ncapacities and  desirable  racial balance  permit the  inference, \nin  fact,  that  his  mission  could  be  re-segregation  of  much \nof  the  system. \nThe  motion  also  contains  no  commitment  on  the  part  of \nthe  Board  to  adopt  any  plan  that  the  computer  may  pro \nduce;  it  gives  no  information  about  the  Board's  intentions \nit \nas  to  other desegregation  methods  it will  use;  prom \na11d \nises  no  result  from  the  delay  except  consideration.  by  the \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n77a \nOrder  dated  Ocf.ober \n10,  1969 \nBoard  of  a  computer  plan  fOl\"  fo-arranging  school  lines. \nThe  motion  is  preoccupied  with  OIle  'method,  and  silent \nahout  results. \nBefore  pnssing  on  the  motion,  the  court  has  a  duty  to \ndiscover whnt  the  Board  has accomplished  sinco  its  July  29 \npromises  wore  made,  and  whether  tho  oxtra  time  will  pro \nmote  genuine  progress  toward  compliance  with  the  Consti \ntution  whet.her  it.  will  just  be  time  lost. \n01' \nTho  Bonrd  is  thol'efol'o  direetod  to  file  with  the  court.  by \n• \nOctober  29,  1069,  the  following  informatioll: \n1.

Since 1970, the Board has operated under explicit court \norders to desegregate, to consider race in its student and faculty assignments, and to avoid the \nestablishment or maintenance ofracially identifiable schools.  These orders remain in force, and \nwill remain in force, until this Court concludes that the school district has eliminated the vestiges \nofthe prior discriminatory system and thus can be declared \"unitary.\"  Although no such \ndetermination has ever been made, the Capacchione and Grant plaintiff-intervenors (collectively \nreferred to as \"plaintiff-intervenors\") contend, notwithstanding the Board's contrary obligations \nunder the desegregation orders, that the Board is prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, from considering race in any facet of \nits operations. II Plaintift:intervenors' claims fail for several reasons. \nFirst, the evidence at trial will show that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district is not \nyet unitary.  As the parties seeking a unitary status declaration, plaintiff-intervenors have the \nburden of proving that the Board has fully and satisfactorily complied with the desegregation \nlJ  Plaintiff-intervenors also sue under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.c. § \n2000d.  The Supreme Court has held that \"the reach of Title VI's protection extends no further \nthan the Fourteenth Amendment\"  United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 732 n.7 (1992). \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 2 of 73\n\norders since their inception and that it has eliminated all vestiges of past discrimination so far as \npracticable.  Board of Edue. o/Okla. City Pub. Sehs. v. Dowell, 498 U,S, 237,249-250 (1991), \nPlaintiff-intervenors cannot meet this burden. \nOn the contrary, the Board continues to operate an increasing number of racially \nidentifiable schools.  It has not complied consistently with the Court's explicit orders, and its \ndesegregation efforts have not successfully eliminated discriminatory conditions that are \ntraceable to the dual system and that persist today,  Although the Board has developed a proposed \nremedial plan (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) that is tailored to redress the \nremaining deficiencies so that the Board can achieve unitary status within five years, the Board \ncannot presently satisfy the Supreme Court's standard for withdrawal of federal court \nsupervision.  Because the school system is not now unitary, the strict scrutiny accorded voluntary \nrace-conscious measures under the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to the Board's \nactions,  The Board's efforts are clearly constitutional given the wide latitude the Supreme Court \nand the District Court have permitted the Board  in discharging its court-ordered responsibilities, \nSecond, even after the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system is declared unitary, the \nBoard still will have compelling interests in maintaining diverse student enrollments and \nfaculties in order to enrich the educational experiences of all children, to ensure equity \nthroughout the system, and to avoid re-creating racially isolated schools that could open the \ndistrict to new discrimination claims,  Both the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have \nrecognized that student assignnlent plans that consider race are within a school district's \ndiscretion to adopt even absent a court order to desegregate,  The Board's compelling interests in \npromoting diversity and avoiding resegregation thus would independently justify the practices \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Documen-t 34 9-0   Filed 04/12/99   Page 3 of 73\n\nchallenged in this case even if the school district were already unitary.  Moreover, the Board's \nproposed remedial plan is narrowly tailored to achieve these objectives. \nThird, as long as the Board remains subject to court orders, there can be no doubt that it \nhas a compelling interest in complying with those orders.  A school board under explicit \ncommand to take race into account in administering its programs cannot rationally be faulted for \nattempting to do -- however incompletely -- what the court directed it to do.  And even if this \nCourt were to conclude that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg system is now unitary and that its \nproposed race-conscious actions are legally prohibited, equity demands that plaintiff-intervenors \nbe limited to prospective relief. \nFinally, even if the Board's actions prior to a unitary status determination were unlawful \nand damages are not otherwise precluded -- which we dispute -- no damages should be awarded \nin this case.  Plaintiff-intervenors' conc1usory allegations of emotional injury purportedly \nresulting from the Board's desegregation efforts fail to meet the Fourth Circuit's requirement that \na plaintiff seeking compensatory damages for emotional distress in an equal protection case \nprove an actual, demonstrable injury flowing from a constitutional violation.  Plaintiff \nintervenors likewise are not entitled to injunctive relief, either because they are no longer \nenrolled in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, or because they cannot show that, but for \nthe Board's race-conscious actions, they would have been assigned to a particular school. \nLeeal Backeround:  The Controlline Court Orders \nAs the history of this case and the ongoing desegregation orders make clear, plaintiff \nintervenors' suggestion that the Board no longer has any duty to take race into account in \noperating the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools is simply wrong. \n4 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 4 of 73\n\nThis case began in 1965 when the schools were de jure segregated.  After a \"freedom of \nchoice\" plan fell short of disestablishing the dual system,  the District Court issued a series of \norders requiring the Board to take affirmative steps to desegregate tbe schools.  See, e.g., Swann \nv.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Ed. ofE  duc., 318 F. Supp. 786 (W.D.N.C. 1970); Swann v.  Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Ed. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265 (WD.N.C. 1970).  See also Swann v.  Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Ed. ofE  duc., 300 F. Supp. 1358 (W.D.N.C. 1969).  These orders ultimately were \nupheld by the Supreme Court, which approved, among other things, the District Court's use of \nmathematical ratios for student assignments; its provision of a majority-to-minority transfer \noption; the race-conscious altering of attendance zones; and the use of busing.  Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Ed. ofEduc., 402 U.S. 1,7-11,22-31 (1971). \nOn remand, the District Court gave the Board discretion to develop and implement \ndesegregation plans consistent with its orders.  In 1974 the Court approved the Board's plan \ndesigned to (among other objectives) \"maintain an integrated school system with a stabilized \nassignment program,\" provide \"appropriately integrated optional schools,\" and ensure that \n\"school location, construction and closing\" decisions aided the desegregation process.  Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Ed. ofEduc., 379 F. Supp. 1102, 1103·04 (W.D.N.C. 1974).  Although \nthe District Court placed the case on inactive status in 1975, Swann v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nEd. ofE  duc., 67 F.R.D. 648 (W.D.N.C. 1975),  it made clear that the existing court orders \nremained in effect: \nDismissal is neither usual nor correct in a case like \nthis where continuing injunctive or mandatory relief has \nbeen required. * * * This case contains many orders of \ncontinuing effect, and could be re-opened upon proper \nshowing that those orders are not being observed. * * * \nThe duty to comply with existing court orders \nrespecting pupil assignment of course remains.  [lei. at 649.) \n-5 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 5 of 73\n\nThe Court reiterated that holding in Martin v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of \nEducation, 475 F. Supp. 1318 (W.D.N.C. 1979), ajJ'd, 626 F.2d 1165 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. \ndenied, 450 U.S. 1041 (1981).  In that case -- which was an earlier version of the case now \nbrought by plaintiff-intervenors  another group of white students challenged an earlier student \nassignment plan that was adopted to comply with the Court's orders in Swann.  In holding in \n1979 that the school system was not unitary, id. at 1329-1340, the Court explained that the 1975 \norder removed the case from the active docket \"without relinquishing jurisdiction\" and was \nintended to give the Board \"maximum leeway\" to address problems remaining from past \ndiscrimination \"within the confines of all orders of continuing effect.\" [d. at 1341. \nThe continuing court orders expressly require the Board to consider race in many areas --\nincluding student and faculty assignment, transportation, and facilities -- while at the same time \ngiving the Board broad discretion to determine precisely how the objective of complete \ndesegregation will be accomplished.  The most pertinent Court orders are summarized below. \nA.  Student Assignments and Transportation.  The Court has repeatedly ordered that \n\"[r)acially identifiable schools may not be operated.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1105.  Neither \nracially identifiable black nor white schools are permitted.  See, e.g., Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 \n(requiring \"[t)hat pupils of all grades be assigned in such a way that as nearly as practicable the \nvarious schools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white \nstudents\" (emphasis added)).  This mandate applies throughout the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \n2,1  See also Swallll v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346, 1349 \n(W.D.N.C 1971) (Board is \"enjoined and restrained from operating any school for any portion of \na school year with a predominantly black student body\");Swalln, 318 F. Supp. at 791 (noting that \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg schools arc \"still segregated,\" including 57 schools that \"arc 'white'\"  and \n-6 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 6 of 73\n\ngeographic area.  The demographic segregation in the region is no excuse for failure to \ndesegregate the schools.  Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 795 (finding that demographic segregation is \nnot \"intractable\" and that \"no part of the system is cut off from the rest of it. \").  The Board has \nbeen directed to devise an equitable and stable student assignment desegregation plan.  See, e.g., \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 362 F. Supp. 1223, 1235 (W.D.N.C. 1973) \n(rejecting plan due to its lack of \"fairness and stability\"). \nThe Board is explicitly required to take race into account in student assignment decisions. \nUnder the Court's orders, it must \"maintain a continuing control over the race of children in each \n* * * \nschool  and maintain the racial make-up of each school (including any new and any re-\nopened schools) to prevent any school from becoming racially identifiable.\" Swann, 311 F. \nSupp. at 268. JI  The Board similarly must take race into account in considering student transfer \nrequests.  The Court has prohibited administrative transfers \"if the cumulative result of such \ntransfers is to restore or substantially increase the degree of segregation in either the transferor or \nthe transferee school.\"  Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 801.:11  The Court has also approved Board \nguidelines requiring that assignment procedures ensure that \"optional schools,\" including magnet \n25 that  \"are predominantly 'black\"'); Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269 (conditioning plan approval in \npart on \"increasing the black attendance at several outlying schools\"). \nJI  See also Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269 (Board shall \"adopt and implement a continuing \nprogram, computerized or otherwise, of assigning pupils and teachers during the school year as \nwell as at the start of each year for the conscious purpose of maintaining each school and each \nfaculty in a condition of desegregation\"). \n:1:1  See also Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 801 ('''[F]reedom of choice' or 'freedom of transfer' may \nnot be allowed by the Board if the cumulative effect of any given transfer or group of transfers is \nto increase substantially the debree of segregation in the school from which the transfer is \nrequested or in the school to which the transfer is desired\"). \n-7 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 7 of 73\n\nschools, are \"appropriately integrated\" and \"prevent significant jeopardy to the racial \ncomposition of other schools.\"  Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103. \n\"[TJransportation,\" under the Court's continuing orders, must \"be offered on a unifoml \nnon-racial basis to all children whose reassignment to any school is necessary to bring about the \nreduction of segregation.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268.  So-called \"one-way bussing\" -- under \nwhich minority students disproportionately bear the transportation burdens associated with \ndesegregation -- is expressly forbidden.  Swann v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofE  duc., 306 F. \nSupp. 1291, 1298 (W.D.N.C. 1969) (\"'One-way bussing' plans for the years after 1969-70 will \nnot be acceptable\"). \nWithin the parameters set by its orders, the Court has made clear that the Board has wide \nlatitude to shape its own solutions to the problems of establishing and maintaining desegregated \nschools.  The Court has stated its intention to \"put on the Board the full duty to bring the schools \n* * \ninto compliance with the Constitution  *, but to leave maximum discretion in the Board to \nchoose methods that will accomplish the required result.\"  Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270. ~ \nB.  Faculty Assignments.  The Board likewise is under continuing court order to \ndesegregate faculty assignments by assigning teachers \"so that the ratio of black and white \nfaculty members of each school shall be approximately the same as the ratio of black and white \nfaculty members throughout the system.\" See Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268  The District Court \n:il  See Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1373 (\"In fOm1ulating its plan the Board is, of course, free to \nuse all of its own resources and any or all of the numerous methods which have been advanced * \n* * \"); \nid. at 1361 (\"It is still to tbis day the local School Board, and not the court, which has the \nduty to assign pupils and operate the schools, subject to the requirements of the Constitution\"). \nSee also Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1347 (declining to modify continuing orders upon detennination \nthat school district  not unitary, and instead \"Ieav[ing] the continued problems of segregation in \nIS \nthe hands of the School Board where they belong\"). \n-8 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 8 of 73\n\nalso has mandated that the most experienced tcachers be equitably distributed throughout the \ndistrict.  Faculty must be assigned \"so that the competence and experience of teachers in fornlerly \nor recently black schools will not be inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in \nthe system.\"  [d. \nC.  Facilities.  The Board is directed to utilize and locate its facilities fairly.  The \nDistrict Court has stated that the \"[uJse of mobile classrooms to increase the accommodations at \noutlying 'white' schools, while leaving inner-city and northwest schools underpopulated, is a \nmisuse of building and site locations which can only have the tendency * * * to promote \nsegregated residential patterns and further lock the school system into the mold of separation of \nthe races.\"  Swann, 362 F. Supp. at 1233 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Swann, \n328 F. Supp. at 1347-48 (rejecting plan that left predominantly black schools under capacity); \nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1231 (same).  Under the Court's orders, \"[b Juildings are to be built where \nthey can readily serve both races.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1107.  Additionally, \"closing or \nconversion\" of schools should not adversely impact desegregation eftorts.  [d.; see also Martin, \n475 F. Supp. at 1330. \nD.  Educational Opportunities.  Segregation, the Court recognized in one of its \nearliest orders, \"produces inferior education\" for minority students, and the performance gap \nbetween majority and minority students in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools \"can not be \nexplained solely in terms of cultural, racial or family background without honestly faclllg the \nimpact of segregation.\"  Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1297.  Accord Swann v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp. 1299, 1308-09 (W.DN.C. 1969).  The Court thus has repeatedly made \nclear that inequalities in student achievement are a vestige of segregation reflecting unequal \neducational opportunities that must be addressed before the school system can be declared \n-9 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 9 of 73\n\nFordice, 505 U.S. at 739.  The moving party must prove that the school district \"'ha[s] complied \nin good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and [that] the vestiges of pas! \ndiscrimination ha[ve) been eliminated to the extent practicable.'\"  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. \n467,492 (1992) (quoting Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-250). \n\"It is well established that once a court has found an unlawful dual school system,\" there \narises a legal \"presumption that current disparities are causally related to prior segregation, and \nthe burden of proving otherwise rests on the [school district].\"  School Bd. of City ofR  ichmond, \nVa.  v.

School Bd. of City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 535 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 \nU.S. 938 (1986). \nThere is no basis in either law or logic for requiring the school system to re-prove the \nexistence of a constitutional violation.  Such a result would reverse the well-established general \nmle governing attempts to modify or vacate court orders, which places the burden of proof \nsquarely on the moving party.  See, e.g., Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383.  Moreover, this result would \nstand on its head the long-standing legal presumption in school desegregation cases that current \nracial disparities are causally related to past discrimination.  Courts thus have held that, when a \nparty other than the school district claims that the vestiges of past segregation have been \n- I I -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 10 of 73\n\neliminated, the moving party bears the burden of proof.

An  Adjudicated Dual School System Cannot Be Declared Unitary Until It \nHas  Complied  Fully  and  Consistently  with  the  Court's  Orders  and \nEliminated All Vestiges of Segregation to the Extent Practicable \nThe Supreme Court has explicitly held that because Charlotte-Mecklenburg is an \nadjudicated dual school system, \"school authorities are 'clearly charged with the affirmative duty \nto take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial \ndiscrimination would be eliminated root and branch.'\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 15 (quoting Green v. \nCounty Sell.

See also \nColumbus Ed. ofE  duc, v. Penick, 443 U,S. 449, 460 (1979).  Indeed, the District Court in this \ncase has found that Board actions have affected residential segregation patterns in the Charlotte \nMecklenburg district.  See, e.g., Swann, 306 F, Supp. at 1304,  School construction decisions that \nexacerbate the racial identifiability of student enrollments thus can also justify denying unitary \nstatus. \nOther components of the school system -- faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular \nactivities, and facilities -- also \"must be free from racial discrimination\" before a desegregation \norder can be vacated.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486 (citing Green, 191 U.S. at 435).  When a school \nboard has reinforced the racial identifiability of its schools through its teacher assignment \npractices, withdrawal of court supervision is inappropriate.  See Brown, 978 F.2d at 590 n.7.  See \nalso Jenkins, 122 FJd at 599-600 (affirming denial of unitary status with respect to faculty and \nstaff assignments because school district's initial compliance with court order had decreased \nsteadily in recent years); id. (unitary status properly denied with respect to facilities where terms \nof decree were not yet \"completely fulfilled\"). \nIn addition to the so-called \"Green factors,\" other areas of inequality within the system, \nsuch as disparities in educational opportunities and other discriminatory practices affecting \nstudent achievement, warrant denial of unitary status if they result from current discriminatory \n- 14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 13 of 73\n\nconduct, or if they cannot be proven to be unrelated to the prior de jure system.

See id. at 222 (evidence showed that achievement disparities, disproportionate \ndiscipline of minority students, and disproportionate referral of minority students to special \neducation classes resulted in part from \"teachers inadequately trained in dealing with multi \nculture classes and who have reduced expectations of what minority students can achieve\").  See \nalso Jenkins, 122 F.3d at 595-599 (affirming denial of unitary status with respect to student \nachievement where disparities in test scores could not be completely explained by external \nsocioeconomic factors). \nThe Supreme Court also has recognized that \"a continuing violation in one area may need \nto be addressed by remedies in another.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497 (\"We have long recognized \nthat the Green factors may be related or interdependent\").  Thus, the Fourth Circuit has affirmed \na district court's decision to maintain supervision of faculty assignments in order to facilitate \ndesegregation of student enrollments.  Stone v. Prince George's County Ed. of Educ., 977 F.2d \n574,1992 WL 238254, at *2-*3 (4th Cir. 1992) (unpub.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1051 (1993). \nSimilarly, the Eighth Circuit has affirmed continued supervision of a district's transportation \nsystem in order to remedy imbalances in student assignments.  Jenkins, 122 FJd at 599.  The \nMartin District Court likewise held that where Green factors \"are dependent upon each other, \nthen all such facets are subject to continuing remedial orders, until discrimination has been \neliminated with respect to those and all other facets of school operation with which they share a \nmutual dependency.\"  475 F. Supp. at 1323. \nC.  The Evidence Will Show That the School District Is Not Unitary \nAs noted above, in 1979 the Martin Court addressed essentially the same claim that the \nGrant and Capacchione plaintiff-intervenors bring now.  See supra at 6-7.  At that time, the \n- 15 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 14 of 73\n\nCourt concluded that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system was not unitary.  See Marlin, 475 \nF. Supp. at 1329-40.  The evidence at trial will show that in the intervening years the district still \nhas not attained unitary status.  Indeed, in many respects the school system has lapsed and \nbecome more segregated and unequal than it was in 1979. \n1.  The Board Has Not Complied Consistently with Explicit Court \nOrders \nThe Board has failed to meet the first Dowell/Freeman standard -- consistent compliance \nwith outstanding Court orders -- in several areas,  Although the nature of the school system's \nnon-compliance has changed over time, the evidence will show that the Board never has fully \ncomplied with the Court\"s express orders governing student assignment and transportation, \nfacilities, and faculty. \nA.  Student Assignment and Transportation.  In 1979 in Martin, the Court found that \nthe school system was not unitary in part hecause the substantial desegregation in student \nassignment achieved as of that time had been accomplished inequitably.  The Board had not \ncomplied with Court-ordered requirements that pairing be done with an equitable number of \nschools serving kindergarten through third grade placed in predominantly white and \npredominantly black areas.  475 F. Supp. at 1333.  The evidence will show that, throughout the \n19805 and into the \\990s, the Board failed to correct this problem. \nMoreover, when the Board abandoned pairings in the 1990s, it did so in a manner that \ncontinued to burden black students disproportionately and that caused other violations of the \nCourt's orders.  First, by adopting a desegregation plan that for the most part transports white \nstudents voluntarily to magnets and mandatorily transports black students from satellites, the \nBoard reverted to \"one-way bussing\" in derogation of one of the Swann COUlt's earliest orders. \n- 16 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 15 of 73\n\n306 F. Supp. at 1298.  Second, by failing to consider the impact ofmagnet schools and other \ntransfers on sending schools, the Board violated the requirement that transfers \"be considered \nprior to approval in light of their impact on the racial composition\" of both sending and receiving \nschools.  Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1337. \nThis failure has contributed to the rapidly growing number of racially identifiable black \nschools in the district.  As previously explained, supra at 7-8, the Court's continuing orders \nexplicitly prohibit racially identifiable schools.  The Court's orders require that no secondary \nschool be greater than fifty percent black, Swann, 328 F. Supp. at 1349; that no elementary \nschool (save one) \"shall be operated with a black student body exceeding the K-6 system-wide \nblack ratio by plus 15 percent,\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofE  duc., Civil Action No. \n1974 (W.D.N.c' Apr. 17, 1980); and that \"pupils of all grades be assigned in such a way that as \nnearly as practicable the various schools at various grade levels have about the same proportion \nof black and white students,\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268.  Although there were few such schools \nin 1979, when the Martin Court held that the district was not unitary, the Board now operates 29 \nsuch predominantly black schools and 13 such predominantly white schools.  Moreover, the \nsystem's non-compliance in this area has grown consistently, particularly during the 19905. \nThe Board has also violated other Court orders during the 1980s and 19905, first by \nselecting school sites that were foreseeably difficult to integrate and then by failing to take \nmeasures to prevent them from operating as segregated white schools.  Martin reiterated the \nrequirement that the Board locate schools \"where they can readily serve both races.\"  475 F. \nSupp. at 1330.  But, when the Board began building a significant number of new schools in the \n1980s (for the first time since these orders were issued), it failed to follow this injunction. \nIndeed, while the Board adopted policies that recognized these Court-ordered requirements, it \n17 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 16 of 73\n\nthen failed to implement them.  As a result. the number of racially-identifiable white schools in \nthe district also has grown dramatically. \nNow, almost a third of the students in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools attend \nsegregated schools that are racially identifiable as black or white schools. \nB.  Facilities.  The Board's practice of building schools for white children in \nsuburban and rural areas has also violated Court orders directly addressing the use of school \nfacilities.  Contrary to the Court's mandate that predominantly white schools not be expanded \nwhile black schools remain underutilized, see supra at 10, the Board in the 1980s and 1990s has \ncontinued to leave vacant seats at predominantly black or racially balanced schools and to serve \nwhite students in large numbers of mobile classrooms at virtually all-white schools rather than \nassigning them to more integrated schools. \nC.  Faculty.  The Board also has violated explicit Court orders governing the \nassignment of faculty.  The district's pattern of growing non-compliance in this area is \nparticularly remarkable given the explicitness of the Court's orders and the degree to which the \ncentral administration has control over faculty assignment. \nAs discussed above (p. 10), the Court explicitly ordered that \"the ratio of black and white \nfaculty members of each school shall be approximately the same as the ratio of black and white \nfaculty members throughout the system\" and that \"the competence and experience of teachers in \nformerly or recently black schools will not be inferior to those in the formerly or recently white \nschools in the system.\"  Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268-269.  The Board, however, did not institute \nand maintain appropriate measures to comply with these clear mandates.  Instead, a clear trend of \nnon-compliance was permitted.  Even when senior officials were made aware of this problem \n111 \nthe early 19905, they took no positive action, and the degree of non-compliance only grew.  As a \n- 18 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 17 of 73\n\nresult, more schools now have racially identifiable faculties than at any time over the last twenty \nyears, and students in racially identifiable black schools have markedly less experienced and less \neducated faculties than students in racially identifiable white schools. \nAll of these actions constitute clear violations ofthe Court's orders, and, until remedied, \nthey alone should prevent a declaration of unitary status.  See Brown, 978 F .2d at 589-590 & n.5 \n(reversing unitary status declaration because school board did not fully desegregate its student \nenrollments and assigned minority faculty and staff to schools with predominantly minority \nenrollments)  Manning, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 1301 (denying unitary status where school board failed \nto address growing racial imbalances).  The Board has squarely acknowledged these failures, and \nas discussed below (pp. 27-29), its proposed remedial plan (attached as Exhibit A) will correct \nthem.  Nevertheless, the Board has not yet satisfied even a minimal obligation to comply with the \nCourt's orders. \n2.  The Board Has Failed to Meet Its Affirmative Obligation to Eliminate \nthe Vestiges of Segregation to the Extent Practicable \nBecause of its failures to comply with the Court's express orders, and because the \nBoard has neglected its affirmative duty to remedy the vestiges of segregation throughout the \nsystem, such vestiges have not been fully eliminated.  On the contrary, the evidence will show \nthat district policies and practices traceable to the dual school system continue adversely to affect \nblack students in many areas, including every Green factor and, most disturbingly, in the \neducational opportunities made available to students. \nA.  EducationalOpPOl1unity.  Gaps in educational outcomes for black and \nwhite students comparable to those the Court already has found to have been caused by the \nsystem of segregated schools persist.  The evidence WIll show that these gaps indicate that black \n19 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 18 of 73\n\nand white students still do not have comparable educational opportunities in the \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg public schools.  The differences in student outcomes are not attributable \nsolely to socioeconomic factors but also result from the differential treatment that black and \nwhite students receive.  Black students are still treated unfairly in Charlotte in two distinct ways: \nthe schools to which the Board assigns racially identifiable black students receive inferior \neducational resources in almost every respect; and black students -- both in those schools and in \nracially balanced or mostly white schools -- do not get the same educational opportunities as \nwhite students.  As a result, black students throughout the school system suffer depressed student \noutcomes. \nIn racially identifiable black schools, students of all races generally perform less \nwell than their peers at other schools.  The reasons for this are clear.  First, the experience and \neducation levels of the faculties at these schools are significantly lower than at other schools. \nSecond, the district has allowed instability in the faculties and administrative leadership of these \nschools.  Third, the instructional materials and media centers provided at these schools are not \ncomparable to other schools in the district.  Fourth, the physical facilities themselves are inferior \nto those of other schools in the district.  Overall, the district's sporadic efforts to improve these \nschools have been inadequate to overcome these inequities. \nThroughout the school system, the district has perpetuated other practices that \ndeny black children equal educational opportunities even at more adequately endowed schools. \nMost notably, since its first efforts to desegregate the school system, the Board has maintained \nadvanced educational programs with principally white enrollments.  Conversely, the district's \npractices have disproportionately assigned black students to lower tracks and to special education \nprograms.  Similarly, since the tumultuous early days of the Board's desegregation efforts, \n-20 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 19 of 73\n\nteacher expectations for black students have not been as high as for white students.  Teacher \nattitudes and expectations undeniably contribute to black students' underrepresentation in \nadvanced classes and overrepresentation in special education programs, and to the higher rate at \nwhich black students lose educational opportunities through disciplinary measures.  Even more \ncrucially, reduced teacher expectations affect the educational experience of black students in \ntheir regular classrooms.  The evidence will show that the Board has not systematically addressed \nthese problems, enabled its teachers effectively to address the needs of black students, or \ndemanded the results that reflect equal opportunities. \nB.  Extracurricular Activities.  Similar problems with attitudes and \nexpectations in some schools and administrative failures in the central office have allowed \nschools to fail consistently to provide the full spectrum of extracurricular opportunities for black \nstudents on the same basis as whites.  Moreover, the district has not effectively monitored itself \nto ensure fair access to extracurricular activities for both black and white students. \nC.  Fa cuIty.  As discussed above, the Board has failed to maintain racially \nbalanced faculties or to provide predominantly black schools with faculties with experience and \nqualifications comparable to those of other schools.  See supra at 20. \nD.  Student Assignment and Transportation.  As discussed above, the Board \nhas failed to comply fully with the Court's orders regarding student assignment.  The level of \nracial balance initially and temporarily achieved by the school system was premised on an \ninequitable and unstable pairing system.  When the Board abandoned this system, however, it \nachieved much less racial balance, while it continued comparable inequities.  See id. at 18-20. \nFactors outside the Board's control do not explain this resegregation. \nDemographic changes have not made desegregation impracticable in Mecklenburg County. \n21 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 20 of 73\n\nIndeed, while the county's population has grown, its overall demographic composition has \nremained remarkably stable.  Likewise, while the mostly black core and mostly white suburban \nareas each have grown, the general pattern remains similar today to what it was in 1970.  Most \nsignificantly, over the same period of time, residential integration has increased significantly.  As \na result, all things being equal, demographic changes make school desegregation relatively easier \nnow than in 1970. \nOf course, all things are not equal.  As noted, the Board has sited schools in places \nthat are difficult to integrate and allowed the quality of many predominantly black schools to \ndeteriorate.  But these factors are vestiges of segregation and results of the Board's failure to \ncomply with the Court orders.  Therefore, they do not absolve the Board of its duty to implement \neffective, practicable desegregation measures. \nE.  Facilities.  The Board's practice of building new schools in predominantly white \nareas, in violation of ongoing court orders, while putting inadequate resources into the \nmaintenance and renovation of existing facilities, also has created disparities in the quality of \nfacilities serving predominantly black and mostly white popUlations.  Again, these disparities \naffect educational opportunity and also complicate the process of student desegregation.  They \ntoo must be remedied to the extent practicable before the school system may be declared unitary. \nThe evidence will also show that the vestiges of segregation in each of these areas are not \ndistinct but interdependent.  More remains to be done in some areas than in others, but further \nactions are necessary in all areas to provide black students in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school \nsystem with the full constitutional remedy that has been deferred for too long. \n-22 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 21 of 73\n\n3.  The Board Can Practicably Do More to Remedy the Effects of \nSegregation, and Its Remedial Plan [s Narrowly Tailored to the Scope \nof the Ongoing Violatioll \nThe new remedial plan that the Board has developed (see Exhibit A) identifies the \nparticular, coordinated measures that it needs to take to become a unitary school system.  The \nplan sets forth practicable and educationally sound measures to redress the vestiges discussed \nabove in a timely manner.  The plan contains five components addressing education \nopportunities; instructional materials and media centers; faculty; student assignment; and \ninstructional facilities.  With this Court's approval of these proposed measures, the Board can \ncomplete the process of converting to a unitary school system within five academic years. \nIn the area of educational opportunities, the Board will implement a number of \nobjectives and strategies, including, for example, ensuring that all students have access to high-\nlevel courses and monitoring extracurricular activities to ensure that they are consistently made \navailable to all students on an equitable basis.  Although it will not be easy to reform the current \nsystem, educational opportunities can be equitably provided to students regardless of race. \nFortunately, that process is already underway, and the Board's remedial plan outlines in detail the \nsteps that must be taken. \nThe gaps in instructional materials and media centers also practicably can be \nclosed.  The Board's proposed remedial plan addresses this basic need in a reasonable fashion. \nCompliance with the Court's orders regarding faculty assignment can most \neffectively be achieved through the type of monitoring and incentive system that the district has \ndeveloped.  With at most minimal mandatory reassignment of teachers, the district can provide \nracially balanced faculties of comparable quality within several years. \n-23 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 22 of 73\n\nIn the area of student assignment, the Family Choice Cluster component of the \nBoard's plan will create desegregated student enrollments without the inequities of pairing or the \ndistrict's current student assignment plan.  To implement this component ofthe plan, the district \nwill divide the county into three to five clusters of comparable student population and school \ncapacity.  Students will be free to choose any ofthe schools within their cluster with preference \ngiven to students living in close proximity to a school or with a sibling attending that school. \nAssignments will then be made based on a lottery that considers school capacity and racial \nbalance guidelines.  The district proposes that each school be no more than fifteen percentage \npoints lower than the cluster-wide black and white percentages and that students of other racial or \netlmic groups fill up to 10% of the seats.  By implementing the student assignment component of \nits plan beginning in the 2001·2002 school year, the district believes that it will be unitary with \nrespect to student assignment by June 2004, which will be the end of the third academic year of \nimplementation. \nBoth to make this student assignment component work and to eliminate the \nvestiges of segregation in the area of facilities, the district also needs to renovate or replace \nseveral schools in the predominantly black areas of the city.  The district has adopted uniform \neducational specifications for its facilities.  These specifications, if consistently implemented, \nshould prevent the kinds of disparities that exist today from recurring in the future. \nOnce these measures and those integrally related steps outlined in the Board's \nremedial plan have been fully and effectively implemented, the Board intends to petition the \nCourt for a declaration of unitary status ir, June 2004.  Until it has fully implemented this plan, \nhowever. the Board cannot in good conscience claim that it has complied with the Court's orders \nor eliminated the vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable. \n-24 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 23 of 73\n\nD.  The Board's Actions Are Plainly Within Its Discretion Under Existing \nDesegregation Orders \nBecause the school district is not unitary, the Board's race-conscious actions are not \nsubject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, as plaintiff-intervenors claim. Court-\nordered desegregation remedies need not pass strict scrutiny, but instead simply \"must be \nreasonably related to the ultimate objective of desegregation.\" Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 993.  See \nalso Swann, 402 U.s. at 15 (once constitutional violation is shown, \"the scope ofa district \ncourt's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, tor breadth and flexibility are inherent \nin equitable remedies\"). \nThis deferential standard extends to the conduct of school districts, which have the \n\"primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving\" the problems related to \ndismantling dual school systems.  Brown v. Board of Educ. of Topeka, 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955). \nThus, when a school board takes race-conscious action \"to fulfill its affirmative duty to eradicate \nthe vestiges of discrimination, pursuant to\" a court order, its \"choice of means to achieve that end \nis entitled to be accorded substantial discretion.\"  Vaughns v. Board ofEduc. ofP  rince George's \nCounty, 742 F. Supp. 1275, 1295 (D. Md. 1990), aff'd sub nom. Stone v. Board ofE  duc. of \nPrince George's County, 977 F.2d 574 (4th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1051 (1993). \nStrict scrutiny does not apply to the school board's conduct, even if the measures it adopts are not \nspecified in the court order.  See id. at 1295-1296 (concluding that race-conscious teacher \nassignment plan was not subject to strict scrutiny and, alternatively, that plan would satisfy \nheightened standard). \nHere, the continuing court orders explicitly require the Board to take race-conscious \nmeasures to desegregate the school system and to avoid the establishment or maintenance of \n.. 25 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 24 of 73\n\nracially identifiable schools.  The Board's proposed remedial plan -- which, as just explained, is \ncarefully tailored to the scope of the original constitutional violation and the Board's ongoing \nfailure to implement fully the Court's orders or other effective remedies -- is well within its \ndiscretion and indeed would survive even heightened judicial scrutiny. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should hold that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school \nsystem is not unitary and should enter judgment for the Board of Education on all of the claims \nof the Capacchione and Grant plaintiff-intervenors and approve the Board's proposed remedial \nplan. \nII.  EVEN AFTER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DECLARED UNITARY, IT WILL \nHAVE COMPELLING INTERESTS IN PREVENTING RESEGREGATION AND \nPROMOTING DIVERSE STUDENT ENROLLMENTS AND FACULTIES \nnlROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM \nIf the Court declares the district unitary (and it should not), it then should release the \nBoard from further court supervision.  Even if declared unitary, the Board  would have a \ncompelling interest in preventing, or at least refusing to contribute to, the re-establishment of \nracially isolated schools.  Once it becomes unitary, the Board should at least be pennitted to \navoid the kind of segregated schools that it has been required to eliminate. \nThe Board also still will have a compelling interest in preserving diverse school \nenrollments and faculties once the Swann case is over.  The Board's goal of promoting the \neducational benefits of an integrated school system -- a goal that repeatedly has been \nacknowledged by the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit, and other federal courts -- through \nmeasures narrowly tailored to achieve that end would justify the race-conscious measures in the \nBoard's proposed plan even absent the desegregation orders to which it is presently subject. \n-2C, -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 25 of 73\n\nA.  The School District Has a Compelling Interest in Preventing the Re \nEstablishment of Racially Isolated Schools \nAs the Fourth Circuit has recognized, school authorities also have a distinct, but similarly \ncompelling interest in avoiding the re-establishment of racially and socioeconomically isolated \nschools once a dual system is released from federal court supervision.  In Riddick, although the \nNorfolk school system had been declared unitary, the school board was concerned that, absent \nchanges in its student assignment plan, resegregation of enrollments would occur. Observing that \nthe school board faced a \"real danger of resegregation,\" 784 F.2d at 540, the Fourth Circuit \nupheld the school board's plan to \"achieve a stably integrated school system\" and specifically \napproved its \"consideration of race\" in the redrawing of \"school assignment lines to result in the \nmaximum amount of integration possible.\"  Id. at 540, 543. \nAfter a declaration of unitary status, of course, there is no longer a legal presumption that \nsegregation is unconstitutional, and proof of intentional discriminatory conduct is necessary to \nestablish an equal protection violation.  !d. at 536.  Significantly, however, if the Board's action \nOr inaction results in segregative impact, such impact would be relevant in an intentional \ndiscrimination case, iii. at 543, as would the long history of segregation in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school system, iii. at 539.  The Board thus would be subject to Equal Protection or \nTitle VI claims by black families if its failure to prevent resegregation radically affected \neducational quality, as it surely would.  Thus, the Board's interest in avoiding \"segregative \n* * * \nenrollment patterns  is clearly sufficiently compelling\" to warrant race-conscious \nassignment policies.  Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 454.1/ \n2/  Furthermore, to the extent that the Board sets and manages student and faculty \npolicies, it should not have to be a \"passive participant\" in a system of discriminatory \nas~ignment \nbehavior in which individual racial \"preferences\" result in the creation of racially isolated \n-27 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 26 of 73\n\nThe evidence at trial will show that, absent Charlotte-Mecklenburg's race-conscious \nstudent assignment practices, the school system would once again become racially segregated to \na substantial degree.  In these circumstances, after a finding of unitary status the Board certainly \nis justified in carefully tailoring its programs to avoid a return to the very racial isolation that it \nhas been under court order to eradicate.  As noted, the Board's proposed plan is so tailored. \nB.  Diverse School Enrollments and FacuIties Are Educationally Valuable, and \nthe School District Has a Compelling Interest in Promoting Them \nBoth the Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit have recognized the Board's discretion to \npromote integration in the Charlotte-Mecklenhurg schools whether or not the school system is \nunitary.  In Swann, the Supreme Court made clear that, while federal courts cannot order a school \nboard to take race-conscious actions absent a constitutional violation, school authorities may take \nsuch actions as a matter of educational policy: \nSchool authorities are traditionally charged with broad \npower to formulate and implement educational policy and \nmight well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare \nstudents to live in a pluralistic society each school should \nhave a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting \nthe proportion for the district as a whole.  To do this as all \neducational policy is within the broad discretionary powers \nof school authorities \n* • \n[Swann, 402 U.S. at 16 (emphasis added).] \n*. \nLikewise, in Martin, both the District Court and the Fourth Circuit expressly held \nthat race-conscious student assignments are within the Board's authority to adopt even absent a \nschools.  See Richmond v. l.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 491-492 (1989) (plurality opinion) \n(\"[A] state or local subdivision (if delegated the authority from the State) has the authority to \neradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction .... Thus, if \nthe city could show that it had essentially become a 'passive participant' in a system of racial \nexclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry, we think it clear that the city \ncould take affim1ative steps to dismantle such a system\"}. \n28 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 27 of 73\n\ndesegregation order.  See Marlin, 626 F.2d at 1167 (rejecting challenge to race-conscious \nassignment plan on ground that \"[t)he School Board is vested with broad discretionary powers \nover educational policy and is well within its powers when it decides that as a matter oJpolicy \nschools should not have a majority of minority students\" (emphasis added); Martin, 475 F. Supp. \nat 1345 (holding that, apart from any court order, assignment plan was \"well within the \nconstitutional authority of the School Board to implement in order to fulfill its independent \ncommitment to the operation of a desegregated school system).\" fij \nThe Supreme Court, moreover, has specifically acknowledged the educational benefits of \ndiverse student bodies.  In his controlling opinion for the Court in Regents oj University oj \nCalzjornia v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), Justice Powell noted the well-established \"belief that \ndiversity adds an essential ingredient to the educational process,\" id. at 322 (opinion of Powell, \nJ.), and concluded that a diverse educational enviromnent \"clearly is a constitutionally \npermissible goal\" in the context of higher education, id. at 311-312.  And the diversity interest is \neven stronger in the context of elementary and secondary schools.  See Washington v. Seattle \nSch. Dist. No.  1,458 U.S. 457, 472, 473 (1982) (observing that both majority and minority \nchildren \"benefit Irom exposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom\" and that such \ndiversity \"prepar[ es] minority children for citizensbip in our pluralistic society, while, we may \nhope, teaching members of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with \nchildren of minority heritage\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); Eisenberg v. \n'iiI  Other courts similarly have held that school districts may take race-conscious actions \nabsent a court order compelling them to do so.  See, e,g., Jacobson v. Cincinnati Bd. ojE  duc., \n961  F.2d 100,  (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 830 (1992); Kromnick v.

Md. 1998) (\"Where children first \nbegin to forge social relationships and interactions with their peers, * * * the need for diversity is \nat its greatest\"). 21 \nAgainst this backdrop, courts have expressly held that the educational value of a diverse \neducational setting is sufficiently compelling to satisfy the strict scrutiny applicable to voluntary \ngovernmental race-conscious actions under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See id. at 453-454 (\"the \ndiversity interest remains a compelling governmental interest\" justifying race-conscious student \ntransfer program in school district that has never been under court order to desegregate). See also \nSmith v.  University a/Wash. Law Sch, 2 F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1334 (W.D. Wash. 1998); Davis v. \nHalpern, 768 F. Supp. 968, 975 (E.D.N.Y. 1991). \nAlthough not all lower courts have reached the same conclusion, see, e.g., Hopwood v. \nTexas,78 FJd 932 (5th Cir.), cert. dellied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996), it bears emphasizing that the \nSupreme Court has never articulated a comprehensive list of goals that qualify as compelling \nstate interests, see Wessmann v.  Gittells, 160 F.3d 790, 796 (1st Cir. 1998), and has suggested \nthat other, nonremedial interests may be compelling.  In fact, the Supreme Court tound in this \nvery case itself that the educational benefits of school integration are sufficient, even absent a \nremedial purpose.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 16.  Likewise, the Fourth Circuit has not held that \nnonremedial interests cannot be sufficiently compelling, see Hayes v. North State Law \nEnforcement Officers Ass '11,10 F.3d 207, 213 (4th Cir. 1993) (declining to decide the question), \n21  Congress and the United States Department of Education also have acknowledged the \nvalue of diversity in public school education.  Congress has made funds available through the \nMagnet Schools Assistance Program to schools -- including schools not under desegregation \norders -- that are \"designed to bring students from di fferent social, economic, ethnic, and racial \nbackgrounds together.\"  20 U.S.c. §~ 7203, 7205(2); 34 C.F.R. § 280.2. \n-30 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 29 of 73\n\nand held in a case closely related to this one that the benefits of voluntary school integration are \nsufticiently great to justify race-conscious means.  Martin, 626 F.2d at 1167. \nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system in particular has a compelling interest in \npromoting the educational benefits of diversity, because the Supreme Court of North Carolina \nrecently held that the right to a \"sound basic education\" is a \"fundamental right\" under the North \nCarolina Constitution. Leandro v. North Carolina, 346 N.C. 336, 348, 488 S.E.2d 249, 255 (N.C. \n1997).  \"An education that does not serve the purpose of preparing students to participate and \ncompete in the society in which they live and work is devoid of substance and is constitutionally \ninadequate.\" !d. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254.  The evidence at trial will show that a diverse \nlearning environment enriches the educational experience for all students and that the educational \nbenefits of diversity are well supported by educational research and practical experience. \nFirst, the evidence will show that racial diversity in the student body and faculty can \nenhance students' civic values by bringing them together in ways that can reduce racial fears and \nstereotypes, teach students how to interact comfortably and respectfully with people who are \ndifferent from them, and prepare students to be good neighbors, colleagues, and citizens in our \nmulticultural, democratic society.  Diversity can positively affect all students' racial attitudes by \nteaching them to appreciate rather than fear personal differences and by showing them that \npersons of different races are not so different after all. As the Supreme Court specifically \nrecognized in Swann, school integration helps \"to prepare students to live in a pluralistic \nsociety.\"  402 U.S. at 16.lQl The civic benefits of diversity also are part of Leandro's \"sound \nlQl  An integrated faculty yields similar beneEts.  See Wygant v. Jackson Ed. of Educ., 476 \nU.S, 267, 315 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"In the context of public education, it is quite \nohvious that a school board may reasonably conclude that an integrated faculty will be able to \nprovide benefits to the student body that could not be provided by all all-white, or nearly all-\n, 31  -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 30 of 73\n\nbasic education\" in North Carolina, which includes preparing students to function in \"a complex \nand rapidly changing society\" and in their \"community, state, and nation.\"  346 N.C. at 347, 488 \nS.E.2d at 255. \nSecond, the evidence will show that racial diversity in the student body and on the faculty \ncan help improve teaching and learning for all students.  Integration provides diverse \nperspectives that can broaden students' understanding of many subjects and strengthen their \ncritical thinking skills.  See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\"People do not learn \nvery much when they are surrounded only by the likes of themselves\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). See also Leandro, 346 N.C. at 347,488 S.E.2d at 255 (\"sound basic education\" \nincludes having a \"sufficient fundamental knowledge\" of various subjects \"to enable the student \nto make informed choices with regard to issues that affect the student personally or affect the \nstudent's community, state, and nation\").  The evidence will also show that placing \ndisadvantaged minority students in desegregated educational settings that promote high \nexpectations can positively affect their educational achievement without negatively affecting the \nperformance of other students. ill \nwhite, faculty.  For one of the most important lessons that the American public schools teach is \nthat the diverse ethnic, cultural, and national backgrounds that have been brought together in our \nfamous 'melting pot' do not identify essential differences among the human beings that inhabit \nour land.  It is one thing for a white child to be taught by a white teacher that color, like beauty, is \nonly 'skin deep'; it is far more convincing to experience that truth on a day-to-day basis during \nthe routine, ongoing learning process\"). \nill  In this respect, the diversity interest is closely related to the interest in preventing racial \nisolation in public schools (discussed below), especially with regard to students who. absent race \nconscious student assignment policies, likely would find themselves in resegregated, high \npoverty schools in Charlotte. \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 31 of 73\n\nThird, the evidence will show that studer.t and faculty diversity can improve students' \npreparation for employment and post-secondary education by teaching them the value of diverse \nperspectives, how to function in diverse business or educational settings, and how to \ncommunicate effectively in our increasingly diverse domestic workforce and the expanding \nglobal marketplace.  This interest is strongly endorsed in Leandro, which states that \"a sound, \nbasic education\" includes providing each student with sufficient skills \"to enable the student to \ncompete on an equal basis with others in further formal education or gainful employment in \ncontemporary society.\" 346 N.C. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255.  Moreover, employers seek and value \nemployees who know the value of diversity and how to work and communicate effectively with \npeople who are different from themselves. \nFinally, the Board has an interest in promoting community cohesiveness and support for \nall of its schools regardless ofrace.  The Family Choice Cluster component or the Board's \nremedial plan (discussed supra at 28) will give all parts of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \ncommunity a stake in the success of every school.  Over the long tenn, this stake will help to \nensure equity in the school system and prevent the redevelopment of a two-tier system on racial \nor other lines. \nFor these reasons, even if the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system is found to be \nunitary, the Board is still justified in carefully tailoring its student and faculty assignment policies \nto promote the educational benefits of diversity.  As discussed, the Board's proposed remedial \nplan in these areas is narrowly tailored. \nTherefore, even if the Court declares the school system unitary, the plaintiff \nintervenors cannot establish that the Board's proposed plan violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \n-33 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 32 of 73\n\nAccordingly, even if the school system is declared unitary, both the Swann and \nCapacchione/Grant cases should be dismissed. \nIII.  EVEN IF IT IS DECLARED UNITARY, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOULD \nNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR COMPLYING IN GOOD FAITH WITH \nEXISTING COURT ORDERS \nEven if the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system is declared unitary (which it should not \nbe), and even if this Court were to determine that no other compelling interests support the race-\nconscious measures at issue in this case (which they do), the plaintiff-intervenors still are not \nentitled to the relief they seek. \nAs long as the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system is an adjudicated dual system, the \nBoard has both an obligation to comply with the desegregation orders to which it is subject, as \nwell as a compelling interest in doing so.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167 n.18 \n(1987) (plurality opinion) (\"judicial determinations of prior discriminatory policies and conduct \nsatisfy the first prong of the strict scrutiny test\").  If the Board's affirmative duties to redress \nracial imbalance in the school system and to consider race in achieving that objective are to be \n1 \nterminated, the Board is \"entitled to a [precise  statement from the court\" to that effect.  Dowell, \n498 U.S. at 246;  see State o/Georgia, 1999 WL 193887, at *5.  Absent such a statement, the \nBoard may not \"unilaterally disregard[]\" any part of the Court's orders, Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 991 \nn.6, and does so only at the risk of being held in contempt and facing further legal challenges \nfrom the Swann plaintiffs. \nThere can be no dispute in this case that the Board adopted the challenged race-conscious \npolicies in an effort to comply with its ongoing obligations under the desegregation orders. \nWhere, as here, a school board tries to fulfill its constitutional obligations pursuant to a court \norder, it cannot reasonably be held to have violated the law.  School boards implementing \n34 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 33 of 73\n\ndesegregation orders should not be \"trapped between the competing hazards of liability,\" \nWygant, 476 U.S. at 291 (O'Connor, 1., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) -- to \noriginal plaintiffs (such as the Swann plaintitIs) and the court., on the one hand, and to other \nparents dissatisfied with the Board's remedial policies (such as the Capacchione and Grant \nplaintiff-intervenors), on the other.  Members of a school board cannot be expected to know \nwhen a district is unitary until a court explicitly states that unitary status has been attained. \nOtherwise, such conflicting duties would hopelessly frustrate the Board's exercise of its authority \nand responsibility to develop and implement etTective desegregation plans to administer public \neducation in an orderly fashion. \nAs the various Swann orders discussed above make abundantly clear, the Board was \nordered to take any and all measures (including the use of optional schools such as magnets) to \neliminate segregation and its vestiges.  To penalize the Board for following those very orders \nwould be nothing less than an emasculation of this Court's authority. \nAlternatively, if this Court concludes that the Board's policies became unconstitutional at \na point before a judicial declaration of unitary status was made, both Dowell and fundamental \nfairness dictate that the plaintitTs should be limited to prospective relief 111 \n1lI  For the reasons discussed above, if the individual defendants in this case are deemed to \nhave been sued in their individual capacities, they have qualified immunity from suit.  It is well \nestablished that \"government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded \nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v, \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  In light of the continuing court orders requiring race \nconscious action to cure an equal protection violation, Charlotte-Mecklenburg school officials \ncould not reasonably have known that their efforts to comply with those same orders might be \nhdd to be unconstitutional. \n-35 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 34 of 73\n\nIV.  THE PLAINTIFF-INTERVF:NORS CANNOT DEMONSTRATE \nCOMPENSABLE INJURIES OR ANY ENTITLEMENT TO INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF \nEven assuming arguendo that the Board's efforts to comply with the continuing court \norders were unlawful-- and that it can be held liable for simply attempting to fulfill its court-\nordered obligations -- no more than nominal damages should be awarded in this case.  To \ndefendants' knowledge, no compensatory damages have ever been awarded in a school \ndesegregation case in this country's history -- trom Brown v.  Board to date.  And with good \nreason.  In equal protection cases, as in any other case, damages must be capable of \nascertainment and cannot be awarded based on speculation.  The injuries caused by de jure \nsegregation, though real. are not readily quantifiable.  In this case, the injuries alleged are vague \nand speculative, as this Court has already suggested.  Capacchione v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSchools, No. 3:97-CV-482-P, at 5-7 (W.D.N.C. Dec. 22,1998). \nThe injury for which plaintiff-intervenors assertedly seek damages is not their exclusion \nfrom a particular school, or the denial of any other tangible benefit, but rather an emotional injury \npurportedly stemming from the Board's race-conscious decisionmaking.  See id. at 6; Complaint \nof Plaintiff-Intervenors at 13.  The law is clear that \"to recover compensatory damages for such \n[equal protection 1v iolations. a plaintiff must suffer actual. demonstrable injury.\"  Price v. City \na/Charlotte, 93 FJd 1241, 1246 (4th Cir. 1996) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1116 \n(1997).  The plaintiff must prove both that the distress actually occurred, and that it flowed from \nthe equal protection violation itself, and not from the denial of an ultimate benefit.  Id. at 1246-\n48.  The damages, moreover, \"must be pfC'vcn by competent, sufficient evidence.\" ld. at 1250. \n\"[NJeither conclusory statements that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress nor the mere fact \n- 36 -\nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 35 of 73\n\nthat a constitutional violation occurred supports an award of compensatory damages.\" Id. at \n1254. \nNone of the plaintiff-intervenors' damages claims satisfies the Price standard. \nConclusory assertions of emotional or mental stress, pain and suffering, humiliation, or lost self \nesteem are plainly inadequate to support an award of compensatory damages absent any proof \nthat the students required medical or psychological attention for their claimed injuries - \nparticularly since the evidence will show that the students generally were well adjusted and \nacademically successful at their assigned schools.  See id. at 1254-56 (collecting cases).  Thus, \nplaintiff-intervenors cannot establish entitlement to actual damages. \nIn fact, however, none of the plaintiff-intervenors' claimed harms can be connected to the \nalleged constitutional violation of considering race in the student assignment and magnet \nadmissions processes.  All of the alleged damages flow not from any alleged constitutional \nviolation, but rather from the denial of admission to particular schools. Emotional damages \nallegedly flowing not from Board's consideration ofrace, but from assignment to a school other \nthan the student's preferred school, are not compensable at all since, under Price, the distress \nmust \"flow from the actual constitutional violation\" itself and not from \"the deprivation of an \nultimate benefit.\"  Id. at 1246.  Therefore, the plaintiff-intervenors' claims for nominal damages \nshould be denied as well. \nNor can the plaintiff-intervenors establish any entitlement to the injunctive relief they \nseek.  Some of the students (Michael Grant, Benjamin Gauvreau), for example, are no longer \nenrolled in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system and thus lack standing to pursue any \ninjunctive relief because they no longer have a \"sufficient personal stake\" in the controversy. \nBurke v.  Citv of Charlestoll, 139 FJd 401,405 (4th Cir. 1998).  See also Arizonans for Official \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 36 of 73\n\nEnglish v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67 (1997) ('To qualify as a case fit for federal-court \nadjudication, an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time \nthe complaint is filed\" (internal quotation marks omitted».  Others, the evidence will show, have \nat all relevant times been assigned to a school close to their home or have already been admitted \nto the magnet school of their choice (Sarah Bentley, Nicholas Gauvreau). \nThe remaining students allegedly should have been assigned to a particular school that \nwas closer to their homes (Rachel Easterling, Alex Thompson, Tierney Willard).  A unitariness \nfinding, however, does not entitle students to attend certain schools of their choosing.  Rather, a \nunitariness declaration means only that the district is released from further court supervision; \npupil assignment decisions are left to the broad discretion of the Board.  Therefore, the plaintiff \nintervenors must establish some other basis for injunctive relief. \nBut even assuming that the Board's efforts to comply with the continuing court orders \nwere unlawful, none of the plaintiff-intervenors can prove that his or her child would have been \nassigned to a specific school but for the Board's consideration of race in fashioning student \nattendance boundaries.  As the Martin Court held, because student assignment plans are \"the \nresult of a complex analysis of several factors,\" 475 F. Supp. at 1345, individual students cannot \nshow that they would have fared differently under a plan that excluded all racial considerations. \nSee id. at 1345-46.  Moreover, because this is not a class action, the plaintiff-intervenors do not \nhave standing to complain about how any children other than their own have been assigned to \nschools.

Based on this data, defendants have concluded that CMS is not yet unitary \nbecause, among other reasons, vestiges of the dual system remain in CMS.  Defendants \nhave further determined that these vestiges are practicable to remedy. \nIn order to begin immediately to address the remaining vestiges, and also to \nimprove educational opportunities for all CMS students, the Superintendent, Dr. Eric \nSmith, developed a plan entitled, \"Achieving the CMS Vision: Equity and Student \nSuccess\" (hereafter \"the Plan\").  The Board adopted the Plan on March 30, 1999. \nThe document that follows sets out those specific steps included in the Plan that \nare necessary and practicable to address the remaining vestiges.  The Board proposes to \nimplement the strategies set out herein over the next five school years with a goal of \nachieving unitary status at that time. \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 40 of 73\n\nl.  Faculty \nA.  Vestiges \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools has not met its court ordered obligations to \ndesegregate completely its faculty or to provide schools with predominately Black \nstudents with a faculty that is as qualified as CMS provides to schools with \npredominately White students.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board ofE  ducation. \n311 F. Supp. at 268.  The distribution of Black teachers is not consistent across schools \nwithin CMS.  Forty-two of the 126 CMS regular schools and seven of the nine CMS \nspecial schools had faculties that were more than 10 percentage points from the system \nwide average percentage of Black teachers in the 1998-99 school year. See Expert Report \nof Dr. Robert Peterkin.  In schools where there is a greater Black student enrollment, \nthere is also a greater proportion of Black teachers.  For example, in 1997-98, 12.8% of \nthe faculty of racially identifiable White schools was Black, compared to 30.0% of the \nfaculty of racially identifiable Black schools. \nIn addition, the distribution of teachers by experience and credentials is not \nconsistent across schools.  The test results for students overall are generally higher in \nschools that are lowest in the percentage of Black students, have the highest percentages \nof experienced teachers and have larger concentrations of teachers with advanced \ncredentials.  See Expert Witness Report of Dr. William Trent. \nDr. Trent and Dr. Roslyn Mickelson found the following conditions currently \nexist in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools regarding experience and credentials: \n2 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 41 of 73\n\n1.  Experience:  Ra~ially identifiable Black schools have less experienced teachers and \nracially identifiable White schools have more experienced teachers than the system \naverage.  The experience level of White teachers at predominantly Black schools is \nsignificantly less than the experience level of White teachers at predominantly White \nschools at the elementary school level.  It is also true that Black teachers at the \nracially identifiable White high school are the most experienced Black teachers at the \nhigh school level. In addition, CMS has assigned professional support staff (e.g., \nlibrarians, counselors, psychologists) in such a way that the staff in racially \nidentifiable Black schools have lower average levels of experience than the average \nexperience of their counterparts in other schools at elementary and middle school \nlevels. \n2.  Advanced Degrees: As the proportion of Black students enrolled in a school \nincreases, the proportion of teachers who have advanced degrees decreases. This \nproblem is more pronounced in high schools and elementary schools than in middle \nschools.  For example, in the racially identifiable White high school, more than 45% \nof the teachers hold advanced degrees, compared to 35% with advanced degrees in \nthe racially identifiable Black high schools. \n3.  Licensure Problems: At the high school level, schools with higher proportions of \nBlack students have more teachers who have licensure problems, such as teachers \nwith provisional licenses, lateral entry teachers, or teachers teaching out of field. \nB.  Objectives \nObjective 1.  Each Charlotte-Mecklenburg school will be in compliance with the \nrequirement of Swallll v. Charlotte-Mecklellburg Board ofE  ducation. that \n3 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 42 of 73\n\nthe \"desegregation of faculty (shall) be accomplished\"  ,by assigning \nfaculty (specialized faculty positions excepted) so that the ratio of Black \nand White faculty members of each school shall be approximately the \nsame as the ratio of Black and White faculty members throughout the \nsystem.\"  311 F, Supp. at 268,  By the beginning of the 2002-03 school \nyear, the racial composition of the faculty at each school will be within 10 \npercentage points of the racial composition of CMS as a whole, \nObjective 2.  CMS will assign teachers to schools in compliance with the court ordered \nrequirement that, \"teachers be assigned so that the competence and \nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently Black schools will not be \ninferior to those in formerly or recently White schools in the system,\"  311 \nF, Supp, at 268,  To implement this requirement, by the beginning of the \n2002-03 school year, each targeted school within CMS will be staffed with \ncompetent and experienced teachers and administrators, These teachers \nand administrators will have the average degree level, number of years of \nexperience and classroom success of the teachers and administrators in the \nschools that CMS defines as academically successful, as measured by the \nN.C, ABCs program, \nC.  Strategies \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will implement the following strategies to meet \nthe objectives listed above: \n4 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 43 of 73\n\nI.  Teacher Assignment Strategies  (Objectives 1,2) \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will design strategies to (a) increase the number of \nBlack teachers at schools with predominantly White student populations, and \n(b) increase the number of White teachers, as well as those with more years of \nexperience, advanced degrees, and demonstrated success in racially identifiable Black \nschools.  Specific teacher assignment strategies include: \na.  Monitor and report teacher exits and transfers, with particular attention to racial \ndiversity issues.  CMS will closely monitor teacher transfers using reports and \npost-transfer surveys.  Information will also be collected through exit interviews. \nb.  Provide improved school profiles that describe the faculty demographics to \nschools at least two times per year. \nc.  Assign new hires from a central pool to schools that are outside of racial diversity \nguidelines. \nd.  Implement transfers by the Superintendent after two years of interventions in \nschools that remain out of compliance.  Initially, volunteers will be sought. \nInvoluntary transfers will be implemented if necessary. \n2.  Additional Support Strategies  (Objectives 1,2) \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will use additional support systems to enhance \nteacher assignment strategies.  These support strategies include training, technology, \nrecruitment and retention, and administrative directives. Examples of specific support \nstrategies are: \na.  Enhance the comprehensive recruitment plan with attention to targeted colleges \nand universities. \n5 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 44 of 73\n\nb.  Enlist teachers and principals to recruit teachers, particularly alumni of \nhistorically Black colleges and universities. \nc.  Evaluate principals using a principal appraisal system that includes diversity \nexpectations. \nd.  Provide training for teachers and administrators that will ensure proper support \nand awareness for diverse populations of students and teachers. \ne.  Seek funding to improve technology in the Human Resources Department to \nenhance CMS hiring and monitoring capacity. \n3.  Targeted School Strategies  (Objective 2) \nCMS will target schools for purposes of this strategy by considering factors such as \nthe percentage of students eligible to receive free or reduced priced lunch, the number \nor percentage of students with limited English proficiency, the percentage of students \nscoring below grade level on End-of-Grade or End-of-Course Tests, and the student \nmobility rate.  CMS will seek funding to implement the following strategies to attract \nexperienced and qualified teachers and administrators to targeted schools: \na.  Recruitment:  Pay a one-time bonus to high-quality, experienced teachers and \nadministrators who are recruited to work in targeted schools.  This bonus will be \npaid to these teachers and administrators if they remain at the targeted school for a \nspecified number of years. \nb.  Retention: \ni.)  Increase the base salary of experienced, high-quality teachers and \nadministrators who are recruited to work in targeted schools for as long as \nthey remain there.  Also, increase the base salary of teachers and \n6 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 45 of 73\n_----------------------_ _ \n...  ..  .... \n\nadministrators who are presently assigned to targeted schools, remain in these \nschools, and demonstrate success. \nii.) Provide a bonus to beginning teachers at targeted schools after their third year \nand increase their base salary after the fourth year.  These individuals must \ndemonstrate classroom success while remaining at the school. \niiL)Continue performance-based incentives currently in place for schools in the \nEquityPlus program. \niv.) Use best efforts to implement tuition-free graduate programs at targeted \nschools through partnerships with local colleges and universities. \n4.  Working Conditions Strategies for the Targeted Schools  (Objective 2) \nUse best efforts to obtain the funding necessary to improve working conditions in \norder to attract and retain experienced teachers at targeted schools. \na.  Designate the staff-to-student ratio on a differentiated basis at targeted schools. \nb.  Provide support staff at targeted schools commensurate with the identified needs \nof the student population. \nc.  Provide preparation time to allow for common planning for grade levels and \ndepartments. \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \nThe Superintendent will monitor the racial composition and qualifications of the \nfaculty at each school and will prepare a semi-annual report for the Board documenting \nprogress on the objectives.  The report also will designate the schools that do not meet the \nobjectives, the racial composition of the students attending each such school, and will \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 46 of 73\n\nmake recommendations for additional steps necessary to bring each school into \ncompliance. \nE.  Funding \nCurrently available funding will be used to partially implement these strategies. \nThe Board has requested in its 1999-2000 budget request to the Mecklenburg County \nBoard of Commissioners additional funding which is necessary to implement these \nstrategies further.  The Board will seek increased funding in 2000-200 I to implement \nthese strategies in full. \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 47 of 73\n\nII.  Instructional Materials and Media Centers \nA.  Vestiges \neMS has not provided instructional materials and media centers in a way that \nstudents at every school have equal access to the appropriate instructional resources. \nSpecific disparities in instructional resources exist when comparing racially halanced \nschools, racially identifiable Black schools and racially identifiable White schools: \n1.  At the elementary school level, students in racially identifiable Black schools have \nhad fewer basic instructional materials available to them than have students at racially \nbalanced or racially identifiable White schools.  As of fall 1998, racially identifiable \nBlack elementary schools needed, on average, $89 per student for instructional \nmaterials to reach baseline standards for mathematics and reading, as compared to \n$67 per student for racially balanced schools and $44 per student for racially \nidentifiable White schools. \n2.  At the middle school level, students in racially identifiable Black schools and at \nracially balanced schools have had fewer basic instructional materials available to \nthem than have students at racially identifiable White schools.  As offa111998, \nracially identifiable Black schools needed, on average, $34 per student and racially \nbalanced schools needed $37 per student in instructional materials to reach baseline \nstandards for mathematics and language arts, as compared to racially identifiable \nWhite schools that needed $21 per student. \n3.  The media centers at racially identifiable Black schools are less adequate than those \nat balanced and racially identifiable White schools.  Seventy-four percent of racially \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 48 of 73\n\nidentifiable Black schools' media centers are automated, compared to 100% of \nracially identifiable White schools and 82% of racially balanced schools.  Also, the \nmedia center holdings for social science, science, applied science, and \nhistory/geography in racially identifiable White schools are more current than in \nracially identifiable Black schools. \nB.  Objectives \nObjective 1.  CMS will implement baseline standards for instructional materials and \nmedia centers.  This will ensure that all teachers and students have access \nto the basic instructional materials and media centers that are necessary to \nsupport the instructional program regardless of the racial composition of \nthe school. \nObjective 2.  CMS will align its budget/funding process and policies to support \ndistribution of instructional materials and media center materials in \nproportion to needs compared to the baseline standards and to eliminate \nracial disparities. \nC.  Strategies \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will implement the following strategies to meet \nthe objectives listed above: \nI.  Instructional Materials (Objectives 1,2) \nThe following strategies will ensure that all schools and classrooms maintain the \nappropriate level of instructional materials. \na.  Establish a curriculum review cycle that includes updating related instructional \nmaterials. \n10 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 49 of 73\n\nb.  Update the standards for instructional materials to ensure continuous alignment \nwith the North Carolina Standard Course of Study. \nc.  Survey schools to determine the level of need by sites. \nd.  Establish a school-by-school instructional materials replacement fund to maintain \nthe district baseline standards. \ne.  Revise Board policies to ensure that funding for instructional materials will be \ndistributed to schools in proportion to each school's deficiencies as compared to \nthe baseline standard. \nf.  Assign responsibility to the principal of each school for maintaining an ongoing \ninventory of the instructional materials allocated to the school.  The principal also \nwill be responsible for supervising the procurement process that ensures \nmaintaining the baseline standards for instructional materials. \n2.  Media Centers  (Objectives 1,2) \nThe following process will be used to ensure that all schools have a media center that \nmeets the baseline standards. \na.  Establish a review cycle of media materials to be coordinated with the curriculum \nreview cycle. \nb.  Update the baseline standards for media center materials to ensure alignment with \nthe North Carolina Standard Course of Study. \nc.  Complete a school-based assessment of collections to determine the extent of \nneed by school site. \nd.  Establish a school-by-school media center materials replacement fund to bring \neach school to the district baseline standards. \n11 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 50 of 73\n\ne.  Assign the principal of each school the responsibility for maintaining an ongoing \ninventory of media materials and for using available funds to procure materials in \naccordance with baseline standards. \nf.  Use best efforts to obtain funds to automate media centers that are not automated. \nMedia centers in all schools that are replaced or substantially renovated as set out \nin the Facilities section of this plan will be automated. \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \nOn an annual basis, the Superintendent will report to the Board any deficiencies in \ninstructional materials and media center materials at each school compared to the \nbaseline standard. The report will include the average deficiency for racially identifiable \nBlack and White schools and for racially balanced schools.  The report will also show \nfunding levels per student for instructional materials and media centers by school and the \nextent to which funding allocations have been used to eliminate racial disparities. \nE.  Funding \neMS began addressing these vestiges with available funding in 1998-99 and will \ncontinue in the coming years.  Funding is available to address the vestiges in instructional \nmaterials and media center holdings over two years.  If eMS has not been able to address \nthe vestiges with regard to library automation by March 2000, eMS will use its best \neffort to obtain adequate funding to eliminate these vestiges in the year 2000-01. \n12 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 51 of 73\n\nIII.  Instructional Facilities \nA.  Vestiges \nRacially identifiable Black school facilities in CMS are educationally inferior and \ninadequate. See Expert Witness Report of Dr. Dwayne Gardner.  Of the facilities Dr. \nGardner examined, 79% of the racially identifiable Black school facilities need major \nimprovements or replacement to meet the instructional program needs.  This compares to \n50% of the racially balanced and 14% of the racially identifiable White schools.  Racially \nidentifiable Black school facilities are also substantially older than racially identifiable \nWhite school facilities.  Only two new schools have been built in predominantly Black \ncensus tracts since 1971.  In contrast, seven of the thirteen racially identifiable White \nschools have been built since 1986. \nB.  Objectives \nObjective 1.  Build new schools and renovate or replace existing schools to ensure \nequitable facilities for all students. \nObjective 2.  Develop, implement and maintain facility standards and specifications to \nassure long-term facilities equity. \nObjective 3.  Maintain existing facilities in an equitable fashion. \nC.  Strategies \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will implement the following strategies to meet the \nobjectives listed above: \n13 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 52 of 73\n\n1.  Replacement and Renovation of Facilities (Objective I) \nThe Board will use its best effort to obtain funding and to replace or substantially \nreplace six schools and to substantially renovate ten schools that are racially identifiably \nBlack or are located in predominantly Black census tracts within three years (by the \nbeginning of the 2002-03 school year or before).  The schools to be replaced or \nsubstantially replaced are Druid Hills Elementary, First Ward Elementary, Merry Oaks \nElementary, Oaklawn Elementary, Lincoln Heights Elementary, and Piedmont Open \nMiddle School.  The schools to be substantially renovated are Briarwood, Pawtuckett, \nAmay James, Statesville Road, Westerly Hills, and Winterfield Elementary Schools and \nCochrane, Eastway, Hawthorne, and Northwest Middle Schools. \n2.  Educational Specifications (Objectives 1,2) \nCMS will develop and implement educational specifications for elementary, middle and \nhigh schools that support the delivery of the curriculum programmatically, functionally \nand spatially.  These specifications will be reviewed and updated biarmually.  In \naddition, CMS will use existing federal, state and local requirements and guidelines to \nthe extent practical to ensure that eMS meets quantity and quality standards for \neducational facilities.  These standards and specifications will be used, to the extent \npractical, for the replacement and renovation of the schools listed in Strategy 1 above. \n3.  New School Sitins (Objective 1) \nTo assUl'e that the siting of new schools is responsive to the value of diversity in student \npopulations, to equitable access to facilities, as well as to projected growth in the  . \nnumber of students, the Board will use the process for site evaluation adopted in its \n\"Long-Range School Facilities Master Plan,\" adopted by the Board on March 9, 1999. \n14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 53 of 73\n\n4.  Quality Assurauce (Objective 3) \nThe Board will continue to Implement its quality assurance and preventive maintenance \nprogram to address issues concerning proper maintenance of all facilities in an equitable \nmanner.  In addition, the Board will develop and will use its best effort to maintain a \ncomputerized facilities management program to track physical assets. \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n1.  The Superintendent will monitor and report to the Board on an annual basis the number, \nlocation, and racial composition of schools which have been constructed or renovated to \nmeet the educational specifications established in accordance with Strategy 2, above, \nand the number, location and racial composition of those which do not meet those \nspecifications. \n2.  The Superintendent will monitor and report to the Board on a semi-annual basis the \nestimated date of completion of the 16 replacement and renovation projects set out in \nStrategy I above. \n3.  The Superintendent will monitor and report to the Board on an annual basis the location \nof additional seat capacity compared to the need for seat capacity by clusters in the \nFamily Choice Cluster Plan. \n4.  The Superintendent will utilize the Facilities Management and Quality Assurance \nChecklist and the CMS Preventive Maintenance Program to report to the Board on an \nannual basis the status of preventive maintenance of facilities by school. \nE.  Funding \nThe Board has made a three year and ten year capital funding request to the \nMecklenburg County Board of County Commissioners that is adequate to correct the \n15 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 54 of 73\n-----------------------------\n... \n.. -.~~  -\n\nexisting disparities in facilities. In particular, the Board is seeking $150,400,000 which is \nnecessary to replace and renovate the sixteen schools listed in Strategy I above.  The Board \nwill use its best efforts to obtain funding necessary to continue to implement its preventive \nmaintenance program. \n16 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 55 of 73\n\nIV.  Educational Opportunities \nA.  Vestiges \nThe CMS remedial efforts have neither effectively addressed nor altered many of \nthe discriminatory and unequal conditions that existed in the dual system, and thus many \nof these conditions remain today.  In particular, the gaps in student outcomes and access \nto rigorous courses between Black and White students are evidence that the vestiges of \nsegregation persist and, as a result, Black students continue to be denied equal \neducational opportunities.  See Expert Witness Reports of Dr. Robert Peterkin, Dr. \nWilliam Trent and Dr. Roslyn Mickelson.  Examples of these vestiges include: \n1.  Black students consistently have scored lower on student outcome measures, even \nwhen free or reduced lunch status and other socio-economic measures are taken into \naccount.  On average, higher income Black students do not perform any better than \nlower income White students. \n2.  Black students historically have taken the Scholastic Assessment Test (\"SAT\") at \nlower rates than White students, and when Black students have taken the SAT, they \nhave scored significantly lower than their White counterparts. \n3.  Black students consistently have not had equal access to advanced educational \nprograms, such as gifted and advanced placement (uAP\") classes. \na.  Black students consistently have been under-represented in gifted programs.  For \nexample, in 1984-85, Black students comprised approximately 39% ofCMS \nenrollment, but only 5.6% of the students enrolled in gifted programs were Black. \nSimilarly, in 1997-1998,40% of the students enrolled in CMS were Black, but \n17 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 56 of 73\n\nBlack students represented only 12% of the students enrolled in the academically \ngifted program. \nb.  Black students routinely have been under.represented in advanced placement \ncourses and in taking advanced placement examinations that lead to college \ncredit.  In 1988·89, for example, approximately 38% of the high school \nenrollment was Black, but only 3.4% of the high school students enrolled in \nadvanced placement classes were Black.  By the 1997·98 school year, Black \nstudents comprised approximately 38% of the high school enrollment, but were \nonly 12.4% of the students who took at least one AP course and were only 6.7% \nof the students who took at least one AP examination. \n4.  Black students historically have been over·represented in programs for Exceptional \nChildren (\"EC\"), especially those programs that use subjective criteria for identifying \nstudents.  In addition, Black students are more likely to receive EC services in \nseparate classes or schools.  For example, in 1997·98, Black students made up more \nthan 70% of those classified as emotionally disabled and 70% of those who received \ninstruction in a separate classroom. \n5.  Black students are more likely to drop out before their senior year, are more likely not \nto graduate even if they are enrolled their senior year, and are less likely to have taken \nthe courses required for admission to the University of North Carolina (HUNC\") \nsystem even if they graduate.  In 1998, for example, only 49% of Black graduates \ncompleted UNC course requirements, compared to 78% of White and other \ngraduates. \n18 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 57 of 73\n\n6.  Black students consistently have been fonnally disciplined at a higher rate than White \nstudents.  For example, on average, for the 1995-96 through 1997-98 school years, \n22% of Black students were disciplined as compared to 8% of White and other \nstudents.  Black students were 66% of those receiving out-of-school suspension, 81 % \nof those excluded, and about 73% of those assigned to special schools for students \nwith discipline problems. \n7.  CMS has failed to monitor whether Black students have equal access to a full \nspectrum of extracurricular activities. \nB.  Objectives \nObjective I.  85% of students in all racial groups will read at or above grade level by \nthe end of third grade. \nObjective 2.  75% of students in all racial groups will complete geometry prior to 11 \nth \ngrade. \nObjective 3.  33% of students in all racial groups will complete at least one Advanced \nPlacement or International Baccalaureate (\"IB\") course by graduation. \nObjective 4.  The percentage of all students, particularly Black students, taking the SAT \nwill increase; and the average CMS SAT score will increase to be at or \nabove the national average. \nObjective 5.  The percent of students with disabilities who graduate with a diploma will \nincrease by 10%. \nObjective 6.  85% of students in all racial groups who begin 9th grade will graduate. \nObjective 7.  The percent of Black students in the gifted program will increase. \nObjective 8.  Black students will have equitable access to extra-curricular activities. \n19 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 58 of 73\n\nC.  Strategies \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will implement the following strategies to meet \nthe objectives listed above: \n1.  Curriculum Development and Materials  (Objectives 1-7) \nProvide a well-defined, high-quality instructional program for all students. \n2.  Acceleration of Course work  (Objectives 2, 3) \nProvide opportunities for students to accelerate their courses and establish a support \nsystem for students who are accelerating their courses. \n3.  System ofPreventjons and Interventions  (Objectives 1,2,3,5,6) \nEstablish an effective system of preventions and interventions for students who \ndemonstrate need, especially students not performing at grade level. \n4.  Transitions between School Levels  (Objective 6) \nEnsure a successful transition for students as they move to the next school level. \n5.

MODitoriDg aDd EvaluatioD \nThe Superintendent will evaluate the implementation of key strategies included in \nthis section and will report to the Board on an annual basis CMS' progress toward \nmeeting the Educational Opportunities objectives. \nE.  FUDdiDg \nThe Board has requested from the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners \nin its 1999-2000 budget request funding to begin implementation of the strategies in this \n21 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 60 of 73\n\nsection. The Board will use its best efforts to obtain funding to further implement these \nstrategies in 2000-2001. \n22 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 61 of 73\n\nV.  Student Assignment \nA.  Vestiges \nIn a number of instances, CMS has failed to comply with the Court orders \nregarding student assignment.  In addition, there are a number of vestiges in eMS \nrelating to student assignment.  See Expert Witness Report of Dr. Gordon Foster. \nExamples of these failures and vestiges include: \nI.  The number of racially identifiable schools has increased steadily from 1978 to the \npresent.  In 1998-99, for example, 36 of the 126 regular schools are racially \nidentifiable in that they vary from the district-wide Black enrollment by more than 15 \npercentage points.  This increase has resulted from CMS action and inaction. \n2.  CMS' use of satellite attendance zones has been discriminatory, in that almost all \nsatellite zones are in predominantly Black areas.  Now, over 90% (63) of the current \n69 satellite zones are in predominantly Black areas.  Some 80% of the students \nresiding in satellite zones - and therefore subject to mandatory busing - are Black, a \ntotal of over 13,000 students. \n3.  Ten schools with magnet programs are racially identifiable. \n4.  The Board's adopted plan was to promote desegregation through stand-alone schools \nand midpoint schools.  CMS has ineffectively implemented both concepts.  For \nexample, by fall 1999, there will be only one midpoint school. \n5.  Contrary to Court order, CMS has concentrated White enrollment in the schools in \nthe southern portion of the county in part by adding mobile classrooms to schools, \nsuch as McKee Road Elementary.  In 1998, McKee Road had 24 mobiles. \n23 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 62 of 73\n\n6.  The Board's siting of schools in the southernmost part of the county has led to those \nschools having such high White enrollment that they are racially isolated. \n7.  The central area of the district, which is predominantly Black, has too few seats and \ninferior, smaller facilities. \nB.  Objectives \nTo address the failures to implement the Court orders and the student assignment \nvestiges, the Board has adopted a new student assignment method - the Family Choice \nCluster Plan.  The objectives of the Family Choice Cluster Plan are to: \nObjective 1.  Increase family choice of schools for their children. \nObjective 2.  Foster family involvement in the schools. \nObjective 3.  Implement the new student assignment process in an orderly manner so \nthat currently enrolled students are allowed to remain in their current \nschool through its terminal grade. \nObjective 4.  Increase the number of students who remain in the same school through \nthe final grade level of that school. \nObjective 5.  Enable siblings to attend the same school. \nObjective 6.  Maximize the number of students attending schools that reflect the \ndiversity of the district. \nObjective 7.  Allow students who live within a defined proximity zone of a school to \nattend that school. \nObjective 8.  Decrease overcrowding and maximize utilization of schools by aligning \nstudent enrollment with the capacity of each school building. \n24 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 63 of 73\n\nObjective 9.  Design the student assigrunent process so that the cost of transporting \nstudents is not disproportionate to the benefits of providing family choice. \nC.  Strategies \nTo carry out these objectives, CMS will divide the county into three to five \nclusters that reflect the demographics of the school system as a whole.  In designing the \nclusters, CMS will balance the following factors to the extent practicable: the racial and \nethnic composition of the students; the economic status of students; the number and \npercentage of English as Second Language students and students with special needs; and \nthe age of schools and projected growth.  CMS may use other appropriate factors to \nensure diversity within and equity acrOss clusters.  Each cluster will also have an \nappropriate number of seats for the number of students living in the eluster. \nEach family will choose from the schools within the cluster in which the family \nresides and the magnet schools serving that cluster, ranking them in the family's order of \npreference.  Based on a family's choices, CMS will use a lottery to assign students to \nschools, taking into account the capacity of each school with preferences given to \nstudents living within a proximity zone, to siblings, to students with special needs and to \nracial and ethnic diversity guidelines.  Once assigned to a school, a student will have the \noption of staying there through the school's terminal grade or re-entering the lottery in \nfuture years. \nThe Family Choice Cluster Plan will have a phase-in schedule and will be \nimplemented beginning in the 2001-02 school year, with the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 \nschool years being used to address equity problems among the schools and to build the \nmfiastructure necessary to implement this process.  For 1999-2000 and 2000-01, students \n25 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 64 of 73\n\nwill continue to be assigned using the current student assignment methods.  Beginning in \n2001-02, students starting in the entry grades of kindergarten, 6, and 9, and students new \nto the system will participate in the Family Choice Cluster Plan. \nI.  Placement of Students in Choice Schools  (Objectives 1,2,4-8) \nOnce the district has designated the clusters, students will be placed in schools as \nfollows: \na.  Preference:  Each family will complete a choice application for each child.  The \napplication will require that the family rank schools within its cluster for each \nstudent.  A family may also rank magnet schools.  Once a student is placed in a \nschool, that student will be able to remain in that school through its terminal \ngrade. \nb.  Residentjal Address (Domicile):  The domicile of the family or legal guardian will \ndetermine from which cluster of schools a family may choose.  Proof of residence \nwill be required at the time a choice application is submitted. \nc.  School Capacity:  Each school's capacity will be used to determine the maximum \nnumber of students who will be placed at the particular school. \nd.  Racial and Ethnic Diversity:  CMS is committed to having diversity among \nstudent populations within each of its schools.  This value is essential in preparing \nCMS students for the multi-ethnic and diverse society of the 21 st century. \nFor the first three years of the Family Choice Cluster Plan (2001-02 through \n2003-04), while eMS is moving toward unitary status, applicants will be chosen \nin accordance with racial balance guidelines, with a target that each school be no \nmore than 15 percentage points below the cluster averages for Black and White \n2(, \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 65 of 73\n\nstudents.  A target will be set for students of other races to fill up to 10% of the \nseats. \nAssuming that CMS becomes unitary after three years of implementing the \nFamily Choice Cluster Plan, beginning with the 2004-05 school year, CMS will \nuse a lottery that is not based on race.  A variety of other methods to achieve \nracial, ethnic and economic diversity within each school will be used.  These \nmethods may include intensive recruiting, incentives, majority-to-minority \ntransfers, and strategies to promote economic diversity. \ne.  Exc~tional Children and English as a Second Language (\"ESL\"):  EC and ESL \nstudents may require specialized facilities or resources to accommodate their \ninstructional needs.  Therefore, these students will be placed first in the choice \nassignment process. \nf.  Siblings:  CMS will accept siblings at the same school within the family's cluster. \ng.  Proximity:  Students who live within a defined, immediate area of a particular \nschool and select that school as a choice will have a proximity priority for \nattending that school. \nh.  Lottery:  Students will be assigned to schools through a lottery that matches \nstudents' ranked choices with school capacity, diversity targets, and proximity \nand sibling priorities.  CMS will enroll as many students as possible in their first \nchoice school.  Students who are not admitted to their first or second choice will \nautomatically be placed on the waiting list for their first choice school. \nApplications will be processed in cycles.  If a family misses the first cycle \ndeadline, the family will have another opportunity in which to submit an \n27 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 66 of 73\n\napplication.  This approach will ensure that each student has an opportunity to \nobtain a seat within a school of hislher choice. \nIf a family does not complete a choice application, the student will be assigned to \na school within hislher cluster based upon the established guidelines.  Extensive \neffort will be made to contact families so that all families complete a choice \napplication. \n1.  Transfers:  Transfers will be approved only based on extreme hardship such as a \nchild's medical need. \nj.  Students Wbo Moye:  Students who move within their cluster may remain in their \ncurrent school.  If a student moves to another cluster during the school year, that \nstudent may remain in the current school of assignment through the completion of \nthe school year without transportation provided, or that student may attend a \nschool in the new cluster with transportation provided by completing a choice \napplication. \nk.  New Students:  Families of students new to eMS will complete and submit a \nchoice application at the time of enrollment or during one of the application \ncycles. \n2.  Placement of Students in Magnet Schools  (Objective 1) \nFamilies will have the option of selecting magnet schools in addition to the other \nchoice schools in their cluster.  Magnet schools with their particular progranunatic \nfocus will continue to be used as a method of providing choice.  There will continue \nto be some countywide magnets.  Some magnet themes will be offered in multiple \nschools, with each cluster being served by one schooL  When appropriate, current \n28 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 67 of 73\n\nmagnet programs may be modified, relocated or discontinued.  Beginning with \npreparation for the 2000-2001 school year, student selection for magnet schools will \nuse the racial and ethnic diversity guidelines set out in I.d. above. \n3.  Phase-in of the Family Choice Cluster Plan (Objective 3) \nDuring the phase-in process, current students in CMS will be allowed to remain at \ntheir current school through its terminal grade.  This applies to all schools, including \nmagnets, except if a schoolwide change is necessary as part of the transition to or \nimplementation of the Family Choice Cluster Plan.  The Family Choice Cluster Plan \nwill have a phase-in implementation sChedule starting with students who enter grades \nK, 6, and 9 in 2001-02.  Based on this phase-in schedule, it will take six years to \ncompletely implement the Family Choice Cluster Plan in the elementary schools, \nthree years in the middle schools and four years in the high schools.  After that time, \nall students will be in schools based on their families' choices.  During the phase-in \nperiod, students in grades 1-5, 7-8, and 10-12 will be allowed to emoll in the schools \nof their families' choice through the choice lottery as space permits. \n4.  Student ASSil:DIDent Infonnatjon Centers (\"SAlC\")  (Objectives 1,2) \nCMS will use its best efforts to inform families and the community of the school \nselection process.  CMS will operate year-round Student Assignment Information \nCenters to assist families with the school selection process.  Each year, families will \nhave a designated time to apply for schools.  Families can obtain applications from \nany school or from the Student Assignment Information Center.  One-on-one support \nservices will be offered at the SAle.  The SAIC will assist families in understanding \n29 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 68 of 73\n-------------------\n-----\n.. ~ ... ~ .....  .. ~----\n\nthe priorities for processing applications.  During school choice selection periods, the \ndistrict will establish additional infonnation centers as needed. \n5.  Transportation  (Objective 9) \nTransportation will be provided for students who attend a school within their cluster, \na magnet school serving their cluster, or a special school, and who live a sufficient \ndistance from the school to warrant transportation.  If a student attends a school that \ndoes not serve that cluster, transportation will not be provided. \n6.  Affordable Housing  (Objective 6) \nTo foster the Board's core value of diversity in the schools, the Board will work \ntogether with the County Commission, the City Council, the governing bodies of the \ntowns, and the business community in developing an affordable housing plan.  This \nplan will promote sound, financially-affordable housing in areas of the county where \nit is lacking.  The Board will work with these bodies to implement the affordable \nhousing plan. \nD.  Monitoring and Evaluation \nTo morutor and evaluate the Family Choice Cluster Plan, the Superintendent will \nprovide an annual report to the Board on the nwnber of applicants; the nwnber of \nstudents who were admitted to their first, second and lower choices of schools; and how \neach school in the cluster was ranked.  In addition, racial, economic, and special needs \ndata will bemorutored to detennine diversity.  The report will also describe academic and \nother enhancements that have been, or are planned to be, implemented to make any \nunder-chosen schools more attractive to families and their children. \n30 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 69 of 73\n\nE.  Funding \nThe Board has requested from the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners \nin its 1999-2000 budget request funding necessary to develop the infrastructure to support \nthe Family Choice Cluster Plan.  Funding necessary to address inequities among schools \nin faculty, instructional materials and media centers, facilities, and educational \nopportunities is set out in sections I, II, III and IV above. \n31 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 490   Filed 04/12/99   Page 70 of 73\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that the foregoing Defendants' Trial Brief was served upon the parties to \nthis action as follows: \nVIA HAND DELIVERY \nJohn O.

All  the  transferee  schools  ex \ncept  West  Charlotte  were  white.  In  addition,  1,245  black \nstudents,  in  specified  were  to  be  transferred  from \nnumbers~ \neight  black  or  largely  black  schools  to  other  designated \nsuburban  white  schools. \nThe  plan  was  accepted  and  approved  because  of  its  ap \nparent  promise  to  extend  tb'€   opportunities  of  a  desegre \ngated  education  to  Over  4,000  new  black  students. \nThe  plan  bas  not  becn  carried  out.  as  advertised:  (a) \nOnly  73  of  t.he  1,245  scheduled  for  transfer  from  over \ncrowded  black  schools  have  been  so  transferred;  those  73 \nwere  transferred not to  the schools  designated, but to  other \nschools  not  mentioned  ill  the  plan.  (b)  I t  is  now  revealed \nthat  the  closed  schools,  which  were  billed  in  July  to  pro \nduce  3,000  black  students  for  transfer,  actually  had  only \n2,627  studmlt.s  in  them  whell  the  schools  closed  in  June! \n• \n(c)  The  Board  allowed  full  fre(!clom  of  choice  for  students \nfrom  the  closed  schools,  and  those  stndents  ill  large  num \nhers  elected  to go  to  Harding High  School,  and  to  Williams \nJunior  Higb,  Northwest  .Junior  High  and  ot.her  black \nschools,  instead  of  to  the  assigned  white  scbools.  As  a  re \nsnlt,  Harding  High  School  was  transformed  immediately \n• \n\n84a \nMemorandum  Opinion  dated  Noveml}cr \n7,  1969 \nfrom  17%  hlaek  to  47%  black.  This  produced  community \nconsternation  but  no  racial  disorder  among  the  students. \nThe  result may be  deplorable,  but the  fact  that the  students \nat  Harding  High  School  have  adjusted  peaceably  to  the \nsituation  (like  others  before  them  a t.  Cornelius,  Dav  idsan, \nOlympic,  Randolph  Road,  Hawthorne  and  Elizabeth.  and \n• \nlike  the  people of Anson  and ot11or  North  Carolina counties) \nshows  that  lfecklenburgers  live  with  desegregated \nCRll \nschools.  (d)  The  transfers  proposed  simply  appear  never \nto  have  been  made  to  most  of  the  suburban  schools  named \nin  the  plan.

More  than  16,000,  however,  are  obviously \nstill in  all-black  or  predominantly black  schools.  The  9,216 \nin  100ro  black  situations  are  considerably  more  than  the \nnumber  of  black  students  in  Charlotte  in  1954  at  the  time \nBrown \nof  the  first  decision.  The  black  school  problem  has \nnot  been  solved. \nThe  schools  are  still  in  major  part  segregated  or  \"dual\" \nrather  than  desegregated  or  \"unitary.\" \nThe  black  schools  are  for  the  most  part in  black  residen \ntial  areas.  However,  that  does  not  make  their  segregation \nconstitutionally  benign.  III  previous  opinions  the  facts  re \nspecting  their  locations,  their  controlled  size  and  their \npopulation  have  already  been  found.  Briefly  summarized, \nthese  facts  are  that  the  present  location  of  white  schools \nin  white  areas  and  of  black  schools  in  black  areRS  is  the \nresult  of  a  varied  group  of  elements  of  public  and  private \naction,  all  deriving  their  basic  strength  originally  from \n\n87a \ntVI emorandu'm  Opinion  dated  N ovem.ber \n7,  1969 \npublic law  or  state  or  local  governmental  action.  These  ele \nments  include  among  others  the  legal  separation  of  the \nraces  in schools,  school  busses,  public  accommodations  and \nhousing;  racial  restrictions  in  deeds  to  land;  zoning  ordi \nnances;  city  planning;  urban  renewal;  location  of  public \nlow  rent  housing:  and  the  actions  of  the  present  School \nBoard  and  others,  before  and  since  1954,  in  locating  and \ncontrolling  the  capacity  of  schools  so  that  there  would \nusually  be  black  schools  handy  to  black  llOighboJ'llOods  and \nwhite  schools  for  white  neighborhoods.  There  is  so  much \nstate action  embedded  in  and  shaping  f;hese  events  that  the \nresulting  segregation  is  not  innocent  or  facto,\"  and  the \n(Ide \nresulting  schools  are  not  \"unitary\"  or  desegregated. \nCHOler. \nFREEDOM  OF \nFreedom  of  choice  has  tended  to  perpetuate  segregation \nby  allowing  children  to  get  out of schools  where  their  race \nwould  be in a  minority.  The  essential failure  of'  the  Board's \n1969  pupil  plan  was  in  good  measure  due  to  freedom  of \nchoice. \nAs  the  court  recalls  the  evidence,  it  shows  that  white \nn·G \nstudents  have  ever  chosen  to  attend  any  of  the  \"black\" \nschool,s. \nFreedom  of  choice  does  not  make  a  segregated  school \nsystem  lawful.  As  the  Supreme  Court  said  in  Green  v. \nNew  Kent  County,  391  U.S.  430  (1968): \n• \n\" .   •  •  I f  there  are  reasonably  available  other  ways, \nsuch  for illustration  as  zoning,  promising  speedier  and \nmore effective conversion  to  a  unitary, nonracial school \nsystem,  'freedom of choice' must be  held  unacceptable.\" \n•,  \nRedrawing  attendance  lines  is  not  likely  to  accomplish \nanything  stable  toward  obeying  the  constitutional  mandate \n• \n\n• \n880. \nkle'l11orandum  Opinion  dated  Noveml}cr \n7,  1969 \nas  long  as  freedom  of  choice  or  freedom  of  transfer  is  re \ntained.  The  operation  of  these  schools  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture  should  not  include  freedom  of  choice  or  transfer \nexcept  to  the  extel1t  that  it  reduces  segregation,  although \nof  course  the  Board  under  its  statutory  power  of  assign \nment  can  assign  any  pupil  to  any  Rchool  for  any  lawful \nreason. \nThe  defendants  filed  some  statistics  concerning  the  one \nhundred largest school  systems  in  the country,  and say  that \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  desegregatioll  compares  favorably \nwith  that  in  roost  of  those  systems.  That  may  well  be  so. \nThe  court  is  not  trying  cases  involving  the  other  ninety \nnine  school  boards,  and has  110t  studied  any  evidence  abont \nthem  and  does  not  know  their  factual  nor  legal  problems. \nThe  court  in  its  first  order  of  April  23,  1969  has  noted  the \nsubstantial  desegregation  achieved  in  certain  areas  in  the \nChaJ\"lotte-r..(ecklenburg  system,  and  is  still aware  of  it.  Tho \nfact  that  other  communities  might  bC'  more  baclnvard  in \nobserving  the  Constitution  than  Mecklonburg  would  hardly \nseem  to  support  denial  of  constitutional  rights  to  Mecklen \nburg  citizens.  The  court  doubts  that  u  double  standard \nexists.  The  Attorney  General  of  the  United  States  has \nfiled  suit for  desegregation  in  Connecticut as  well  as in  the \nwhole  State  of  Georgia.  One  of  the  most  stringent  de \nsegregation  orders  on  record  was  entered  recently  against \na  school board in  the  City of  Chicago.  Constitutional  rights \nwill  not he  denied  here  simply  because  they  may  be  denied \ndelayed  elsewhere.  There  is  no  \"Dow-Jones  average\" \n0)\" \nfor  such  rights.  With  all  due  deference  to  the  complexities \nof  this  scbool  system,  which  have  already  been fully  noted \n\n89a \ndatelZ \nMemorandum.

From  the  testimony  of  its  members, \nand  from  the  latest  report,  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  a \nmajority  of  its  members  have  accepted  the  court's  orders \nas  representing  the  law  which  applies  to  the  local  schools. \n\n.. \n• \n91a \n111 cmorandum  Opinion.  dated  N ovem1Jcr \n7)  196.9 \nBy  the  responses  to  the  October  10  questions,  the  Board \nhas  indicated  that  its  members  do  not  accept  the  duty  to \ndesegrcgate  the  schools  at  any  ascertainablc  time;  and \nthey  have  clearly  indicated  that  they  intend  not  to  do  it \neffective  in  tho  fall  of  1970.  They  have  also  demonstrated \na  yawning  gap  hetween  predictions  and  performance. \nWithholding  or  delaying  the  constitutional  rights  of \nchildren  to  equal  educational  opportnni ty  on  such  vague \nterms  as  these  is  not  the  province  of the  School  Board \n1Ior \nof  this  court. \nFurthermore,  since  the  Supreme  Court  has  now  pro \nhibited  lower  courts  from  granting  extensiollS  of  time,  it \nmay  we]]  he  that  gmdual  time  table  laid  down  by  this \nthl~ \ncourt's  Apl'il  23,  1969  order  contemplating  substantial \nprogress  in  1969  and complete  dcsegrcgation  hy  September \n1970)  was  and  is  too  lenient. \nI f  the  plan  tendered  by  the  School  Board  on  November \n17,1969 is  thol'ough  a11(1  informative,  and  sufficiently  shows \nan  unconditional  purpose  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to  com \nplete  its  joh  effective  by  September,  1970,  the  Board  may \nperhaps  be  allowed  to  adhere  to  the  exist.ing  time  table. \nCertainly  a  Mecklenburg  plan  ought  if  possible  to  be  pre \npared  by  the  :Mecklenburg  School  Board  and  its  large  and \nexperienced  staff,  I'ather  than  by  outside  experts.  Decision \non  that  and  other  pending  questions  must  await  further \ndevelopments,  including  the  Board's  November  17,  1969 \nreport.. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe  school  system  is  still  discriminatol'ily  segregated  by \nIn \nrace  and  maintained  that  way  by  state  action.  many \nways  it  is  not  in  compliance  with  the  Constitution.  The \nBoard has  not  shown  a  valid  basis  for  an  extension  of  time \n\n- - - - - - - - -\n92a \nlIieJnorandum,  OpiJI:ion  dated  November  7,  1969 \nto  comply  with  the  court's  judgment;  it  has  shown  no  in \ntention  to  comply  by  any  particular  time  with  the  consti \ntutional  mandate  to  desegregate  the  schools;  and  it  has \nsuggested  its  intention  to  comply  by  September,  1970. \n-not \nIn  spite  of  those  facts  the  court  would  like  as  a  matter  of \ndiscretion  to  grant  some  of  the  time  extension  requested, \nbut is of the considered opinion  that in Alexander v.  Hormes \nCoun.ty  the  Supreme  Court  has  prohibited  the  exercise  of \nwill \nsuch  discretion.  The  findings  of  fact  in  this  opinion \nbe  considered,  along  with  facts  found  in  previous  orders, \nopinions and memoranda, as the  basis  for  such  future  judg \nments  and  orders  as  may  be  appropriate,  including  such \njudgments  and  orders  as  may  be  appropriate  upon  receipt \nof  the  Board's  November  17,  1969  plan.  All  statements  of \nfact  in  this  memorandum  opinion,  whether  or  not  labeled \nas  such,  shall  be  deemed  findings  of  fact,  as  necessa ry  to \nsupport such  jUdgments  and  orders. \nThis  the  7th  day  of  November,  1969. \n/ s /   B.

(hereinafter collectively  \"Grant\"),  filed  April  16,  1999,  for \nSanctions against Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education for Non-Disclosure of Witnesses \n[document no. 152].  Defendants Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools ct al. (\"CMS\") tiled a response \non April 19, 1999. \nThe trial in this consolidated action began on April 19, 1999.  In a pretrial conference held \non April]3, 1999, Grant orally moved the Court to sanction CMS for refusing to identify its trial \nwitnesses.  To that date, CMS only had identified five expert witnesses and one non-expert witness. \nDuring the conference, the Court ordered CMS (and all parties) to exchange witness lists by the \nfollowing morning.  On April 14, 1999, three business days before trial, CMS disclosed a witness \nlist naming 174 potential trial witnesses.!  The overwhelming majority of these witnesses were never \ndisclosed previously.  Thus, Grant filed the instant motion on April 16, 1999.  In the motion, Grant \nasserts that CMS's non-disclosure gives rise to extreme prejudice and is a violation of this Court's \nOrder on September 16, 1998. \nOn September 16,  1998, the Court ruled lll1  a Motion to  Compel  by Grant.  Grant had \npropounded an interrogatory to CMS in May  1998 that asked CMS to identify those persons it \nexpected to call as witnesses attrial and to provide a summary of the subject matter of each witness's \ntestimony. eMS only disclosed the six witnesses mentioned above. The Court ruled that any further \ndisclosures  were  perhaps  premature  \"at  this  time,\"  but  the  Court  ordered  that  \"CMS  must \n!CMS's list included 44 of its own witnesses, 53 rebuttal witnesses (principals and \nteachers of the plaintiffs' children), and 77 witnesses incorporated from the other parties' lists \n(32 from Grant: 45 from the Swann PlaintitIs).  eMS also reserved the right to call more \nwitnesses. \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 517   Filed 04/23/99   Page 2 of 4\n\nsupplement its response, as it promised, when such information becomes known.\"  (Order ofSep!. \n16,1998, at 7.) \nThe Court has expressed its concern on several occasions throughout the discovery period \nin this case that CMS was lacking candor in disclosing relevant and important information.  This is \nclearly one of those occasions.  First. presenting a list of 174  witnesses, most of whom were \npreviously unidentified, just three business days before trial is extremely prejudicial to opposing \ncounsel.  Under such circumstances, Grant is denied the ability to effectively cross-examine the \nwitnesses and must conduct fishing expeditions during trial. \nSecond, eMS's explanation fix failing to disclose the information earlier is based on a \ntortured reading of the Court's Order of September 16, 1998.  The Court specified the manner of \ndisclosure of the information-\"when such information becomes known\"-and this Court's Order \noverrides the Pretrial Order or any other rule otherwise applicable.  In a case of public imponance \nsuch as this, certainly CMS knows that its actions amount to unfair legal maneuvering.  CMS was \nnot substantiallyjl1sti tied in its dilatory tactics. The disclosure of such basic infonnation as potential \ntrial witnesses-information normally required much earlier under RL!le 26 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Proccdure2-is fundamental to a fair trial.  CMS was simply playing games, and such conduct \nis inexcusable. \nThird,  it  appears  that  many  of CMS's  witnesses  may  be  irrelevant  or  unnecessarily \ncumulative.  Without exception, the Court will allow CMS to present any witness that is a party, its \n2While the provisions of Rule 26(a), requiring disclosure of trial witnesses 30 days bet()re \ntrial, may be superseded by a pretrial order. the policy of early disclosure cannot be ignored. \nWhile the Court's Pretrial Order requires parties to lodge witness lists wilh the Co uri on the first \nday of trial. CMS cannot reasonably assert that this allows them to conceal the identities of its \npossible witnesses until that time comes, especially when the Court ordered them to produce \nsuch information as soon as it became available. \n2 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 517   Filed 04/23/99   Page 3 of 4\n\nexpert witnesses, and anyone previously deposed or interviewed by Grant.  Beyond that, the Court \nbelieves that the prejudice may be cured only by granting a continuance during the trial and allowing \nGrant to depose CMS' s other named witnesses. \nAccordingly, the Court will cpntinue this trial for one week following the presentation of \nGrant's evidence.  During that week, Grant may interview or depose any of the twenty-six witnesses \nnamed in CMS's Revised  Witness  List, which was filed  with the Court today.  eMS will be \nresponsible for all attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Grant in seeking this continuance and \nin conducting these depositions and/or interviews. \nNOW,  THEREFORE,  IT  IS  ORDERED  that  Granfs  Motion  for  Sandions against \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education for Non-Disclosure of Witnesses [document no.  1521 \nbe, and hereby is.

(1964),  to  consider  a  single  as \npect  of  the  above-captioned  case:  the  constitutionality  and \nimpact of a  state statute, N.  C.  Gen.  Stat. § 115-176.1  (Supp. \n1969),  known  as  the  nntilJUssing  law,  on  this  suit  brought \nto  desegregate  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  school  system. \nWe  hold  a  portion  of  N.  C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 115-176.1  unconsti \ntutional  because  it  may  interfere  with  the  school  board's \nperformance of its affirmative  constitutional duty under  the \nequal  protection  clause  of  t.he  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nI. \nOn  February  5,  1970,  the district  court  entered  an  order \nrequiring  the  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  School  Board  to  de-\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n229a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Co1trt  duted  April \n29,  1970 \nsegregate  its  school  system  according  to  a  court-approved \n·plan.  Implementation  of  the  plan  could  require  that  13,300 \nadditional  children  be  bussed.  This,  in  turn,  could  require \nI \nnp  to  138  additional  school  buses. \n~ \nPrior  to  the  February  5  order,  certain  parties  filed  a \nsuit,  entitled  Torn  B.  Ha.rris,  G.  Don  Roberson,  et  al.  v. \nWillimn  C.  Self,  Superintendent  of  CharloUe-M \necklenb~(,rg \nSchools  m1d  Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board  of  Education.,  in \nthe  Superior  Court of Mecklenburg  County,  a  court of gen \neral jurisdietion  of the  State of North Carolina.  Part of  the \nrelief  sought  was  an  order  enjoining  the  expenditure  of \npublic funds  to  purchase,  rent or operate any  motor vehicle \nfor  the  purpose  of  transporting  students  pursuant  to  a \ndesegregation  plan.  A  temporary  restraining  order  grant \ning  this  relief  was  entered  by  the  state  court,  and,  in  re \nsponse,  the Swann  plaintiffs moved  the district court to  add \nthe  state  plaintiffs  as  additional  parties  defendant  in  the \nfederal  suit,  to  dissolve  the  state  restraining  order,  and \nto  direct  all  parties  to  cease  interfeJ·ing  with  the  federal \ncourt  lIHindates.  Because  it appeared  that  the  constitution \nality  of  N.  C.  Gen.  Stat.  § 115-176.1  (Supp.  1969)  would  be \nin  question,  the  district court  requested  designation  of  this \nthree-judge  court  on  February  19,  1970.  On  Februa.ry  25, \n1970, the district judge granted the motion  to  add additional \nparties.  :Meanwhile,  on  February  22,  1970,  another  state \nsuit,  styled  1I1rs.  Robe1·t  Lee  Moore,  et  nl.  v.  Charlotte-\n--\nOn  March  5,  the  Fourth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  stayed \n1970, \n1 \nthat  portion  of  the  district  court's  order  requiring  bussing  of  stu \ndents  pending  appeal  to  the  higher  court . \n• \nThere  is  a  dispute  between  the  parties as  to  the  additional  um \n~  11 \nber  of  children  who  be  bussed  and  as  to  the  number  of  addi \nwill \ntional  buses  that  will  be  needed.  For  our  purposes,  it  is  imma \nterial  whose  figures  are  correct.  The  figures  quoted  are  taken \nfrom  the  jUl]ge's  supplemental  findings  of  fact,  filed  March \ndi~trict \n21,  1970. \n\n230a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  Dist.rict  Court  dated  April  29,  1970 \nMecklen.burg  Board  of  Education  and  W·illiam  C.  Self, \nSuperintendent  of  Ch4rlotte-Mecklenburg  Schools,  was  be \ngun.  In  this  second  state  snit,  the  plaintiffs  also  requested \nan  order  enjoining  the  school  board  and  superintendent \nfrom  implementing  the  plan  ordered  hy  the  tlistrict  court \non  February  5.  The  state  court  judge  issued  a  temporary \nrestrai.ni.ng  order  ern bodyi ng  the  relief  reqllcRted,  and  on \nFebruary 26,  1970,  the  Swa'tvn  plaintiffs  moved  to  add Mrs. \nMoore,  ct  ai.,  as  additional  parties  defendant in  the  federal \nsuit.  On  the  same day,  the  state  defendants  filed  a  petition \nfor  removal  of  the  Moore  suit  to  federal  court.  On  March \n23,  1970,  the  district  judge  requested  a  three-judge  court \nin  the  removed  Moore  case,  and  this  panel  was  desihrnated \nto  hear  the  matter.  An  the  cases  were  consolidtaed  for \nhearing,  and  the  court  heard  argument  by  all  parties  on \nMarch  24,  1970. \nII. \nN.  C.  Gen.  Stnt.  § 115-176.1  (Supp.  1969)  reads: \nAssignment  of  pupils  based  all  race,  creed,  color  or \nnational  origin prohibited.  No  person  shall be  refused \nadmission  into  or  be  excluded  from  any  public  school \nin  this State on  account of race,  creed,  color or national \norigin.  No  school  attendance  district  zone  shall  be \n01' \ndrawn  for  the  purpose  of  segregating  persons  of vari \nous  races,  creeds,  colors  or  national  originR  from  the \ncommunity. \nWhere  administrative  units  have  divided  the  geo \ngraphic  urea  into  attendance  districts  or  zones,  pupils \nRhall  be  assigned  to  schools  within  snch  attendance \ndistricts;  provided,  however,  tbat  the  hoard  of  educa \ntion  of  an  administrative  unit  may  assign  any  pupil \nto  a  school  outside  of  snch  attendance  district  or  zone \nin  order  that  such  pupil  may  attend  a  school  of  a \n\n- - - - - - - -\n2313, \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nspecialized  kind  including  but  not  limited  to  a  voca \ntional  scbool  or  school  oporat.ed  for,  or  operating  pro \ngrams  for,  pupils  mentally  or  physically  handicapped, \nor  for  any  other  reason  which  the  board  of  education \nin  its  discretion  deems  sufficient.  No  student  shall \n~ole \nbe  assigned  or  compelled  to  attend  any  school  on  ac \ncount  of  race,  creed,  color  or  national  origin,  or  for \ntbe  purpose  of  creating  a  balance  or  ratio  of  race,  re \nligion  or  national  origins.  Involuntary  bussing  of  stu \ndonts  in  contravention  of  this  article  is  prohibited,  and \npublic  funds  shall  not  be  used  for  any  such  bussing. \na \nThe  provisions  of  this  article  shall  not  apply  to \ntemporary  assignment  due  to  the  nnsuitability  of  a \nschool for  its  intended  purpose  nOr  to  any  assignment \ntransfer  necessitated  by  overcrowded  conditions  or \n01' \notber circumstances  which,  in the  sole  discretion  of  the \nschool  lloard,  require  Ilssignment  reassignment. \n01' \nThe  provisions  of  this  al'ticle  shall  not  apply  to  an \napplication  for  the  assignment  or  reassignment  by  the \nparent,  guardian or person standing  in  loco  parentis  of \nany  pupil  or  to  any  assignment  made  pursuant  to  a \nchoice  made  by  any  pupil  who  is  eligible  to  make  such \nchoice pursuant to the provisions of a  freedom  of choice \nplan  voluntarily  adopted  by  the  board  of  education  of \nan  administrative  unit. \nI t  is  urged  upon  us  that  the  statute is  far  from  clear and \nmay  reasonably  be  interpreted  several  different  ways. \n, \n(A)  Plaintiffs  read  the  statute  to  mean  that  the \nschool board is prevented from  complying with  its  duty \nunder  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  establish  a  uni \ntary  school  system.  See,  e.g.,  Green  v.  C(JU,nty  School \nEd.  of N cw  Kent  Cmmty,  391  U.S.  430,  439  (1968).  In \n• \n• \n\n232a \nof  Dist-rict  Court  April \nOrder  Three-Judge  dated \n29,  1970 \nsupport  of  this  contention,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the \nNorth  Carolina  General  Assembly  passed  § 115-176.1 \nin  response  to  an  April  23,  1969,  district  court  order, \nwhich  required  the  school  board  to  submit  a  plan  to \ndesegregate the  Charlotte schools for the 1969-70  school \nyear.  Under  plaintiffs'  interpretation  of  the  statute, \nis  denied  non \nthe  board  all  desegregation  tools  except \ngerrymandered  geographic  zoning  and  frecuom  of \nchoice.  Implicit in this,  of course,  is  the suggestion that \nzoning  and  frcdom  of  choice  will  be  ineffective  in  the \nCharlotte  context  to  disestablish  the  asserted  duality \nof  the  present  system. \n(B)  The  North  Carolina  Attorney  General  argues \nthat  the  statute  was  passed  to  preserve  the  neighbor \nhood  school  concept.  Under  his  interpretation,  the \nstatute  prohibits  assignment  and  bussing  inconsistent \nwith  the  neighborhood  school  concept.  Thus,  to  dis \nestablish  a  dual  system  the  district  court  could,  con \nsistent  with  the  statute,  only  order  the  board  to  geo \ngraphically zone  the attendance areas  that, as nearly \nSO \nas  possihle,  each  student  would  be  assigned  to  the \nschool  nearest  his  home  regardless  of  his  race.  Im \nplicit  in  this  argument  is  that  any  school  system  is \nper  se  unitary if it is  zoned  according  to  neighborhood \npatterns  that are  not  the  result  of  officially  sanctioned \nracial  discrimination.  Although  the  Attorney  General \nemphasizes the  expression  of state  policy  by the Legis \nlature  in  favor  of  the  neighborhood  school  concept,  he \nrecognizes,  of  course,  that  the  statute  also  permits \nfreedom  of choice  if  a  school  bORrd  voluntarily adopts \nsuch  a plan.  Thus, the  plaintiffs  and  the  Attorney Gen \neral  read  the  statute  in  much  the  same  way:  that  it \nlimits  lawful  methods  of  accomplishing  desegregation \n\n- - - - - - - -\n233a \nOrde1·  of  Three·Judge  District  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nto  nongerrymundered  geographic  zoning  and  freedom \nof choice. \n(0)  The  school  board's  interpretation  of  the  statute \nis  more  ingenious.  The board concedes  that the  statute \nto \nprohibits  assignment  according  to  race,  assignment \nachieve  racial. balance,  and  involuntary  bussing  for \neither  of  these  purposes,  but  contends  that  the  facial \nprohibitions  of  the  statute  onJy  apply  to  prevent  a \nschool  board  from  doing  more  than  necessary  to \n.  attain  a  unitary  system.  The  argument  is  that  since \nthe  statute  only  begins  to  operate  once  a  unitary \nsystem  has  been  established,  it  in  no  way  interferes \nwith  the  board's  constitutional  duty  to  desegregate \nthe  schools.  Counsel  goes  on  to  insist  that  Oharlotte \nMecklenburg  presently  has  a  unitary  system  and, \ntherefore,  that  the  state  court  constitutionally  applied \nthe  statute  to  prevent  fnrther  unnecessary  racial \nbalancing. \n(D)  Plaintiffs  in  the  Harris  suit  contend  (1)  that \n% \nin  42  U.S.C.  2000c(b)  and  2000c-6(a)(2)  (1964)3 \n§ 2000c: \n3 \nAs  used  in  this  subcbapter-\n•  •  •  •  • \n• \n(b)  \"Desegregation\"  means  the  assignment  of  students  to \npublic  schools  anil  within  such  schools  without  regard  to  their \nrace,  eolor.  religion,  or  national  origin,  but  \"desegregation\" \nshall  not  mean  the  assignment  of  studenu,  to  public  schools \nin  order  to  overcome  racial  imbalance. \n§ 2000c-6 (a)  : \n(2)  [P] rovided  that  not.hing  herein  sha 11  empower  any  offi \ncial  or  court  of  the  United  States  to  issue  any  order  seeking \nto  achieve  a  racial  balance  III  any  school  by  requiring  the \ntrunsportatioll  of  pupils  or  students  from  one  school  to \n[lllother  or  one  sehool  dist.rict  to  another  in  order  to  achieve \nracial  ba.lance.  or  otherwise  enlarge  the  existing  power \nslIch \nof  the court to  insure compliallce  with  constitutioual  standards. \n\n234a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Court  date(Z  Apr-il \n29,  1970 \nCongress  expressly prohibited  assignment  and  bussing \nto  achieve  racial  balance,  (2)  that  to  compel  a  child \nto  attend  a  school  on  account  of  his  race  or  to  com \npel  him  to  be  involuntarily  bussed  to  achieve  a  racial \nbalance  violates  the  principle  of  Brown  v.

However,  the \nMoore  plaintiffs  also  argue  that  certain  parts  of  the \nsecond  and  third  paragraphs  ill  the  state  statute  are \nunconstitutional  because  they  give  the  school  board \nthe  authority  to  assign  children  to  schools  for  what \never  reasons  the  board  deems  necessary  or  sufficient. \nThe  Moore  plaintiffs  interpret  these  portions  of  the \nstatute  as  permitting  assignment  and  bussing  on  the \nbasis  of  race  contrary  to  Brown  and  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nIII. \nFederal  courts  are  reluctant,  as  a  matter  of  comity  and \nrespect  for  state  legislative  judgment  and  discretion,  to \nstrike down  state  statutes  as  l1TIconstitutional,  and  will  not \ndo  so if the  statute  reasonably can be  interpreted  so  as  not \n\n----- - - - - - - ----- -------- - - - - - - - - -\n-\n2.35n \nOrder  of  .Three-Judge  Dist1'ic/.

But  to  read  the \nstatute  as  innocuously  as  the  school  board  suggests  would, \nwe  think,  distort and  twist the  legislative  intent.  ·We  agree \nwith  plaintiffs  and  the  Attomey  General  that  the  statute \nlimits  the  remedies  otherwise  available  to  school  hoards \nto  desegregat.e  the  schools.  The  harder question  is whether \nthe  limitation  is  valid  or  conflicts  wit.h  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.

Bd.  of  New  Kent  Co.,  391 \nU.S.  430  (1968),  the  Supreme  Court  declared  that  a  school \nboard  must take  effective action  to  establish  a  unitary,  nOll \nracial  system,  if  it  is  not  already  operating  such  a  system. \nThe  Court.  neither  prohibited  nor  prescribed  specific  types \nof plans,  but,  rather,  emphasized  that  it  would  judge  each \nplan  by  its  ultimate  effectiveness  in  achieving  desegrega \nIn \ntion.  Green  itself,  the  Court  held  a  freedom-of-choice \nplan  insufficient  because  the  plan  left  the  school  system \nsegregated,  but  stated  that,  under  the  circumstances  exist \ning  in  New  Kent  County,  it appeared  that  the  school  hoard \ncould  acbieve  a  unitary  system  either  by  simple  geo \ngraphical  zoning  or  by  consolidating  the  two  schools  in \nvolved  in  tbe  case.  391  U.S.  at 442,  n.  6.  Under  Green  and \nsubseqnent  decisions,  it  is  clear  that  school  boards  must \nto \n-implement  plans  that  work  achieve  unitary  systems. \n:Northcross  v.

Plans  that  do  not \nproduce  a  unitary  system  are \nunacccptable.~ \nWe  think  the  enunciation  of  policy  by  the  legislature \nof the  State  of  North  Carolina  is  entitled  to  great  respect. \nFederalism  requires  that whenever  it is  possible  to  achieve \na  unitary  system  within  a  framework  of  neighborhood \nschools,  a  federal  court ought not  to  require other remedies \nin derogation  of state  policy.  But if  in  a  given  fact context \nthe  state's  expressed  preference  for  the  neighborhood \nschool  cannot  be  honored  without  preventing  a  unitary \nsystem,  it  is  tho  former  policy  which  must  yield  under \nthe  Supremacy  Clause. \nStated  differently,  a  statute  favoring  the  neighborhood \nschool concept, freedom-of-choice  plans,  or both can  validly \nlimit  a  school  board's  choice  of  remedy  only  if  the  policy \nfavored will  not prevent the  operation  of a  unitary  system. \nThat  it  mayor  may  not  depends  upon  the  facts  in  a \nparticular school  system.  The  flaw  in  this  legislation  is  its \nrigidity.  As  an  expression  of  state  policy,  it  is  valid.

The  first  paragraph \nof  the  statute  reads: \nN a  person  shall  be  refused  admission  into  or  be \nexcluded  from  any  public  school  in  this  State  on \naccount  of  race,  creed,  color  or  national  origin.  No \nschool  attendance  district  or  zone  shall  be  drawn  for \nthe  purpose  of  segregating  persons  of  various  races, \ncreeds,  colors  or national origins  from  the  community. \nThere  is  nothing  uncollstitutional  in  this  paragraph.  I t  \nis  merely  a  restatement  of  the  principle  announced  in \nBt'own  v.  Bd.  of  Ed.  of  Topeka,  347  U.S.  483  (1954) \n(Brown.  I). \nThe  third  paragraph  of  the  statute  reads: \nThe  pJ\"Ovisiolls  of  this  article  shall  not  apply  to  a \ntemporary  assignment  due  to  the  unsuitability  of  a \nschool  for  its  intended  purpose  nor  to  any  assignment \nor  transfer  necessitated  by  overcrowded  conditions  or \ncircumsta1lces  which,  in  the sole discretion  of the school \nboard,  require  assiglIDlent  or  reassignment. \nThis  paragraph  merely  allows  the  school  board  1I0ninvidi \nom;  discretion  to  assign  students  to  schools  for  valid  ad \nministrative  reasons.  As  wo  read  it,  it  does  not  relate \nto  race  at  all  and,  so  read,  is  constitutional. \nThe  fourt.h  paragraph  provides: \nThe  provisions  of  tbis  article  shall  not  apply  to  an \napplicat.ion  for  the  assigl1ment  or  reassignment  by  the \nparent,  guardian  or  person  standing  in  loco  parentis \n\n238a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  District  Cou.rt  dated  Ap·ril \n29,  1970 \nof  any  pupil  or  to  any  assignment  made  pursuant  to \na  choice made by  any pupil  who  is  eligible  to  make  snch \nchoice pnrsuant to  the provisions of a  freedom  of choice \nplan  voluntarily  adopted  by  the  board  of  education  of \nan admini8trative unit. \nThis  paragraph  relieves  school  boards  from  compliance \nwith  the  statute  where  they  are  implementing  voluntarily \nadopted  freedom-of-choice  plans  within  their  systems.  I t  \ndoes  not  require  the  hoards  to  adopt  freedom  of  choice \nin  any  particular  sitnation,  but  leaves  them  free  to  comply \nwith  their  constitutional  duty  by  any effective  means  avail. \n•  •  • \nable,  including,  wherc  it  is  appropriate,  freedom  of  choice. \nSo  interpreted,  the  paragraph  is  constitutional. \nThe  second  paragraph  of  the  statute  contains  the  con \nstitutional  infirmity.  It  reads: \nWhere  administrativc  units  have  divided  the  geo \ngraphic  area  into  attendance  districts  Or  zones,  pupils \nshall  be  assigned  to  schools  within  such  attendance \ndistricts;  provided,  however,  that  the  board  of  educa \ntion  of  an  administrative  unit  may  assign  any  pupil \nto  a  school  outside  of  snch  attendance  district  or  zone \nin  order  that  such  pupil  may  attend  a  school  of  a \nspecialized  kind  including  but  not  limited  to  a  voca \nt.ional  school  or  schoo]  operated  for,  or  operating  pro \ngrams  for,  pupils  mentally  or  physically  handicapped, \nor  for  any  other  reason  which  the  hoard  of  education \nin  its  sole  discretion  deems  sufficient.

Con \nsequently,  this  sentence  does  not  prevent  the  boards  from \ncomplying  wit.h  their  const.it.utional  duty  in  circumstances \nwhore  zoning  and  neighborhood  school  plans  may  110t  re \nsult  unitary  system.  The  clanse  in  the  first  sentence \nill  11 \npermitting assignment for  \"any other reason\"  in  the hoard's \n\"sole discretion\"  we  read  as  meaning simply  that the school \nboards  lllay  assign  outside  the  neighborhood  school  zone \nfor  noninvidious  administrative  reasons.  So  read,  it  pre \nsents  no  difficulty.  The  second  anel  third  sentences  are \nUllconstitlltional.  They  plainly  prohihit  school  hoards from \nassigning,  compelling,  hussing  students \nOJ'  involuntRril~' \naccount  of  raCD,  or  in  order  to  racially  \"balance\"  the \n011 \n• \nschool  system.  Oree·Jl.  v.  School  Bd.  of  New  Kent  Co.}  391 \nU.S.  4-30  (] 968),  Hrown  v.  Bd.  of  Ed.  of  T02Jeka ..  349  U.S. \n294  (1955)  (Brown II), and Brown v.  Bd.  of Ed.  of Topeka .. \n347  U.S.  483  (1954)  (Brown  I),  require  school  boards  to \nconsider  race  for  the  purpose  of  disestablishing  dual \n•  systems. \nThe  Oonstitution  is  not  color-blind  with  respect  to  the \naffirmative  dut.y  to  establish  and  operate  a  unitary  school \nsystem.  To  say  that  it  is  would  make  t.he  constitutional \nprinciple  of  Brown  I  and  II  an  abstract  principle  instead \nof  an  operative  one.  A  flat  prohibition  against  assignment \nby  race would,  as  a  practical  mat.ter,  prevent  school  boards \n£l'Om  altering  existing  dual  systems.  Consequently,  the \nstatute  clearly  contravenes  the  Supreme  Court's  direction \n\n240a \nOJ'der  of  Three-Judge  Distr-ict  Court  dated  April \n29,  1970 \nthat  boa rds  must  take  steps  adequat.e  to  abolish  dual  sys \ntems.  See  Green  v.  School  Bel.  of  K cnt  Co.,  391  U.S.  430, \n437  (1968).  As  far  as  the  prohibition  against  racial  \"bal \nance\"  is  concerned,  a  school  board,  in  taking  affirmative \nsteps  to  desegregate  its  systems,  must  always  engage  in \nsome  degree  of  balancing.  The  degree  of  racial  \"balance\" \nnecessary  to  establish  a  unitary  system  under  given  cir \ncumstances  is  not  yet  clear,  see  N o-rtl/cross  v.  Bd.  of  Ed. \nof  the  Memphis  City  Schools,  U.S.  ,  38  L.W.  at \n4220  (1970)  (Chief  .T usticc  Burger  concurring),  but  be \ncause  any  method  of  school  desegregation  involves  selec \ntion  of  zones  and  transfer  and  assigllment  of  pupils  by \nrace,  a  flat  prohibition  against  racial  \"balance\"  violate!;  the \nequal  protection  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nFinally,  the  statute's  prohibition  against  \"involuntary \nbussing\"  also  violat.es  the  equal  protection  clause.  Bussing \nmay  not  he  necessary  to  eliminate  a  dual  system  and  es \ntablish  a  unitary  one  in  a  given  case,  but  we  think  the \nLegislature  went  too  far  when  it  undertook  to  prohibit  its \nuse  in  all  factual  contexts.  To  say  that  bussing  shall  not \nbe  resorted  to  unless  unavoidable  is  a  valid  expression  of \nstate  policy,  but  to  flatly  prohibit  it  regardless  of  cost, \nextent  and  all  other  factors  including  willingness  of  a \nschool  board  to  experiment  contravenes,  we  think,  the \nimplicit  mandate  of  Green.  that  all  reasonable  methods  be \navailable  to  implement  a  unitary  system. \nAlthough  we  hold  these  statutory  prohibitions  uncon \nstitutional  as  ,;olative  of  equal  protection,  it  does  not \nfollow  that  \"bussing\" will  be  an  appropriate  remedy  in  any \nparticular  school  desegregation  case.  On  this  issue  we \nexpress  no  opinion,  for  the  question  is  now  on  appeal \nto  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fourth \nCircuit  and  is  not  for  us  to  decide. \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n241.a \nOrder  of  Three-Judge  Dis/.\"'Let  Court  dated  A2)l'i/, \n29,  1970 \nI t  is  clear  that  each  case  must  be  analyzed  on  its  own \n• \nfacts.  Sec  Gree'n  v.  School  Bd.  of New  Kent  Co.,  391  U.S. \n430  (1968).  The  legitimacy  of  t.he  solutions  proposed  and \nordered  in  each  case  must  be  judged  against  the  facts  of \nparticular  school  system.  We  merely  hold  today  that \nR \nN ort.h  Carol i na  may  not  validly  enact  laws  that  prevent \nthe  utilization  of  any  reasonable  method  otherwise  avail \nable  to  establish  unitary  school  systems.  Its  effort  to  do \nso  is  struck  down  by  the  equal  protection  clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause  (Article \n2  of  the  Constitution). \nv \nAs we  have  no  cause  to doubt  the  sincerity  of the  various \n• \ndefendants,  the  plaintiffs'  Illotion  to  hold  thcm  in  contempt \nfor  interference  with  the  district  court's  orders  and  their \nrequest  a1l  injullction  against enforcement of the  statnte \nfOI' \nwill  be  denied.  We  believe  the  defendants,  including  the \nstate  court  plaintiffs,  will,  pending  appeal,  respect  this \ncourt's  judgment,  which  applies  statewide  with  respect  to \nthe  constitutionalitv  of  the  statute . \n• \nSeveral  of  tho  parties  have  moved  to  IJe  dismissed  from \nthe  case,  alleging  various  grounds  in  support  of  their \nmotions.  Because  of  the  view  we  take  of  this  suit  and  the \nlimiteu  relief  we  grant,  the  motions  to  dismiss  become  im \nmaterial.  The  school  board  is  undeniably  a  proper  party \nbefore  the  court  on  the  constitutional  issue,  since  it  is  a \npurty  to  the  desegregation  suit.  We  can,  therefore,  con \nsider  alld  adjudge  thc  validity  of  the  statute,  rcgardle!:is  of \nthe  of  the  other  parties.  That  we  consider  the \npo~ition \nsubstantive  arguments  of  all  the  parties  in  no  way  harms \nthose  who  have  moved  to  he  dismissed. \nAn  appropriate  judgment  will  be  entered  in  accordance \nwith  this  opinion.

See,  Green v. County School Board, supra,\n5aIza, \nat 442 n.6; Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell,\n375 F.2d 158 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 387 -U.-§.. 931\n(1967); Felder v.

Accordingly,\nif it appears that the racial characteristics of the re-\nmaining Negro schools can be eradicated by pairing, the\ndecisions suggest that a school board is obligated to ex-\nplore that possibility. See Nesbit v. Statesville City\n-8-\n\nBocrd of Education, Amu; Es12 v.

It seems\nti\napparent that, wherever unitary zoning would produeea'school\nwhich is. more than 40 percent Negro, this limitation; and\na prohibition on pairing inevitably require perpetuation\nof an all-Negro school. As the district court observed,\nsuch a use of a \"60-40 ratio is a one-way street.\" Opinion\n'and Order, Dec. 1, 1969, at 3. While such a ratio may be\nacceptable in some circumstances, we do not believe that\nit can be used to perpetuate segregation.(cid:9) See Lee v.\n9\n\nMacau County Board of Education, C. A. No. 604-E (M.D.\nAla., April 3, 1970) (Conecuh County). --/\n/ Three cases in which the United States is an appellant\nare now pending before this Court and involve a similar use\nof racial percentages limiting desegregation: United\nStates v. School Board of FranklinCitt, ' No. 14,276; United \nStates v. ComatyIsliool_Board_of Southampton, No. 14,278;\nBeckett  & United States v. School Board of Norfolk, (not\nyet docketed).\n- 10 -\n\nB. In reviewing district courts' remedial\ndecisions in school-desegregation cases, appellate courts\nshould consider the function of the district court as\nenunciated in Brown II:\nSchool authorities have the primary\nresponsibility for elucidating, assessing,\nand solving these problems; courts will\nhave to consider whether the action of\nschool authorities constitutes good\nfaith implementation of the governing\nconstitutional principles. Because of\ntheir proximity to local conditions and\nthe possible need for further hearings,\nthe courts which originally heard these„.\ncases can best perform this judicial\nappraisal. . . .\nIn fashioning and effectuating the\ndecrees, the courts will be guided by -\nequitable principles. Traditionally, •\nequity has been characterized by a\npractical flexibility in shaping its(cid:9) •\nremedies and by a facility for adjusting\nand reconciling public and private needs.\nThese cases call for the exercise of\nthese traditional attributes of equity\npower.\nBrown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 299-300,(1955).\nSubsequent decisions of the Supreme Court in school-desegre-\ngation cases have adhered to the principle that district\ncourts have wide discretion in fashioning appropriate\nremedies. See, e.g., Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S.\n\nn.4, \n430, 438  439, 442 n.6 (1968); Griffin v. County \nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218, 232-34 (1964); cf. Carter \nv. ImryCommission, 396 U.S. 320, 336.:37 (1970); Turner\nv. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 355 (1970). Most recently, in\nUnited States v. Montgomery County Board of  Education,\n395 .U.S. 225 (1969), while not holding that school boards\nhave a constitutional duty to racially balance faculties,\nthe Supreme Court held that it was fully within a district\ncourt's discretion to require compliance with such a\nvs.\nstandard; and in Alexander v. lialnotjnytB21rd--of\nEducation, 396 U.S. 19 (1969) (per curiam), the Court.\nauthorized requiring implementation of educator-deirised-\ndesegregation plans although the Court recognized that\nthose plans were not the exclusive means of carrying out\nconstitutional mandates.\nYet district courts are commissioned by Brown II\n0, give weight to \"public and private considerations,\"\n349 U.S. at 300; .Green v. County School Board supra\nspeaks in terms of plans that are \"reasonally available\"\nand \"feasible,\" 391 U.S. 441, 439; and Mr. Justice Harlan\nin Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board,\n38 U.S.L.W. 3265 (U.S., Jan. 14, 1970) refers to\n- 12 -\n\nthe \"workability\" of proposed desegregation plans. Such\nreferences suggest that district courts should be appropri-\nately guided by considerations of educational soundness\nadministrative feasibility, and the resources available\nto defendant school boards.\nReferences in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to busing\nfor the purpose of achieving racial balance, 42 U.S.C.\n§2000c-6(a), may have a similar utility. Those provisions\nare not, of course, prohibitions on either school boards\nor federal courts; for they were designed(cid:9) simply to\nremove any implication that the Civil Rights Act conferred\nnew jurisdiction on courts to deal with the constitutionally\nunsettled question of whether school boards were obligated\nto overcome purely adventitious, de facto segregation.\nSee, e.g., 110 Cong. Rec. 2280 (Congressman Cramer), 13820\n(Senator Humphrey), 13821 (Senator Javits); United States\nv. School District 151 404 F.2d 1125, 1130 (7th dir.\n1968); United States v. Jefferson Count Board of Educa-\ntion, 372 F.2d 836, 886 (5th Cir. 1966). The references\nsuggest however, that courts might carefully consider\nwhether, for the purpose of achieving a precise, system-\nwide racial balance, a plan would require a school board\n- 13 -\n\ninvoluntarily to make unreasonable increments in trans-\nportation expenditures, the number of students bused,\ndistances traveled, and the like. Thus, we think that\nthe question facing this Court is whether, in view\nof the district court's supplemental findings, the\ncircumstances of the case, and the alternatives reason-\nably available, the court below invoked a remedy so\nextreme as to constitute an abuse of discretion. The\ndifficulty in measuring the court's decree against the\nabove considerations is the absence of any other -accept-\nable plan in the record.\n\nC. This Court, then, may want to consider what\noptions are now available to the district court as a\nresult of changes in practical considerations of\ntiming. The district court, in its February 1970\ndecision, considered the mandates of the Supreme Court\nin Alexander v. Holmes Count Board of Education, supra,\nand Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, supra,\nand subsequent decisions of this Court, Nesbit v. States-\nville Ciy Board of Education, supra; Stanley v.-*-\nDarlington County School District, No. 13,904 (4th Cir.,\nJan. 19, 1970), as requiring immediate implementation of\na desegregation plan and, therefore, directed. the school\n•\nboard to implement the available plan which, in the\nCourt's view, was consistent with the board's constitutional\nobligations. As a practical matter, the stays recently\ngranted by this Court and the district court have obviated\nthe urgency in adopting a plan occasioned by the need for\nimplementation during this school year. Consequently, the\ndistrict court now has an opportunity to increase the\noptions available to it.\n- 15 -\n\nWe would suggest that the district court's earlier\nsuggestion that the school board consult educational\nexperts from the Office of Education of the United States\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare now be made\na mandatory requirement. See Alexander v. Holmes County\nBoard of Education, supra; United States v. Hinds County\nSchool Board, 417 F. 2d 852 (5th Cir. 1969) (per curiam);\nWhittenbeu v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.\ns\nSupp. 784 (D. S.C. 1969); Singleton v. Jackson Municipal\nSeparate School District, No. 26,285 (5th Cir., Dec. 1,\n1969) (en bane) (per curiam). We think that, in the\nevent that the case Is remanded for that purpose, it would\nbe appropriate for this Court to indicate some guidelines\nfor the formulation of a new plan, including,,for example,\ndirectives to consider techniques of drawing zone lines\nto promote rather than frustrate desegregation and\npairing, grouping, clustering, and school consolidation;\nany new plan should also take into account such resources\nas may be available to the school board to desegregate\nits system more fully. It would be appropriate for this\nCourt to provide a reasonable timetable within which a\n- 16 -\n\nfinal plan is to be approved well before commencement of\nthe 1970-1971 school year. Moreover, the district court\nshould retain jurisdiction until such time as \"it is\nclear that state-imposed racial segregation has been\ncompletely removed.\" Green v.

In reviewing district courts' remedial\ndecisions in school-desegregation cases, appellate courts\nshould consider the function of the district court as\nenunciated in Brown II:\nSchool authorities have the primary\nresponsibility for elucidating, assessing,\nand solving these problems; courts will\nhave to consider whether the action of\nschool authorities constitutes good\nfaith implementation of the governing\nconstitutional principles. Because of\ntheir proximity to local conditions and\nthe possible need for further hearings,\nthe courts which originally heard these„.\ncases can best perform this judicial\nappraisal. . . .\nIn fashioning and effectuating the\ndecrees, the courts will be guided by -\nequitable principles. Traditionally, •\nequity has been characterized by a\npractical flexibility in shaping its(cid:9) •\nremedies and by a facility for adjusting\nand reconciling public and private needs.\nThese cases call for the exercise of\nthese traditional attributes of equity\npower.\nBrown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 299-300,(1955).\nSubsequent decisions of the Supreme Court in school-desegre-\ngation cases have adhered to the principle that district\ncourts have wide discretion in fashioning appropriate\nremedies. See, e.g., Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S.\n\nn.4, \n430, 438  439, 442 n.6 (1968); Griffin v. County \nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218, 232-34 (1964); cf. Carter \nv. ImryCommission, 396 U.S. 320, 336.:37 (1970); Turner\nv. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 355 (1970). Most recently, in\nUnited States v. Montgomery County Board of  Education,\n395 .U.S. 225 (1969), while not holding that school boards\nhave a constitutional duty to racially balance faculties,\nthe Supreme Court held that it was fully within a district\ncourt's discretion to require compliance with such a\nvs.\nstandard; and in Alexander v. lialnotjnytB21rd--of\nEducation, 396 U.S. 19 (1969) (per curiam), the Court.\nauthorized requiring implementation of educator-deirised-\ndesegregation plans although the Court recognized that\nthose plans were not the exclusive means of carrying out\nconstitutional mandates.\nYet district courts are commissioned by Brown II\n0, give weight to \"public and private considerations,\"\n349 U.S. at 300; .Green v. County School Board supra\nspeaks in terms of plans that are \"reasonally available\"\nand \"feasible,\" 391 U.S. 441, 439; and Mr. Justice Harlan\nin Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board,\n38 U.S.L.W. 3265 (U.S., Jan. 14, 1970) refers to\n- 12 -\n\nthe \"workability\" of proposed desegregation plans. Such\nreferences suggest that district courts should be appropri-\nately guided by considerations of educational soundness\nadministrative feasibility, and the resources available\nto defendant school boards.\nReferences in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to busing\nfor the purpose of achieving racial balance, 42 U.S.C.\n§2000c-6(a), may have a similar utility. Those provisions\nare not, of course, prohibitions on either school boards\nor federal courts; for they were designed(cid:9) simply to\nremove any implication that the Civil Rights Act conferred\nnew jurisdiction on courts to deal with the constitutionally\nunsettled question of whether school boards were obligated\nto overcome purely adventitious, de facto segregation.\nSee, e.g., 110 Cong. Rec. 2280 (Congressman Cramer), 13820\n(Senator Humphrey), 13821 (Senator Javits); United States\nv. School District 151 404 F.2d 1125, 1130 (7th dir.\n1968); United States v. Jefferson Count Board of Educa-\ntion, 372 F.2d 836, 886 (5th Cir. 1966). The references\nsuggest however, that courts might carefully consider\nwhether, for the purpose of achieving a precise, system-\nwide racial balance, a plan would require a school board\n- 13 -\n\ninvoluntarily to make unreasonable increments in trans-\nportation expenditures, the number of students bused,\ndistances traveled, and the like. Thus, we think that\nthe question facing this Court is whether, in view\nof the district court's supplemental findings, the\ncircumstances of the case, and the alternatives reason-\nably available, the court below invoked a remedy so\nextreme as to constitute an abuse of discretion. The\ndifficulty in measuring the court's decree against the\nabove considerations is the absence of any other -accept-\nable plan in the record.\n\nC. This Court, then, may want to consider what\noptions are now available to the district court as a\nresult of changes in practical considerations of\ntiming. The district court, in its February 1970\ndecision, considered the mandates of the Supreme Court\nin Alexander v. Holmes Count Board of Education, supra,\nand Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, supra,\nand subsequent decisions of this Court, Nesbit v. States-\nville Ciy Board of Education, supra; Stanley v.-*-\nDarlington County School District, No. 13,904 (4th Cir.,\nJan. 19, 1970), as requiring immediate implementation of\na desegregation plan and, therefore, directed. the school\n•\nboard to implement the available plan which, in the\nCourt's view, was consistent with the board's constitutional\nobligations. As a practical matter, the stays recently\ngranted by this Court and the district court have obviated\nthe urgency in adopting a plan occasioned by the need for\nimplementation during this school year. Consequently, the\ndistrict court now has an opportunity to increase the\noptions available to it.\n- 15 -\n\nWe would suggest that the district court's earlier\nsuggestion that the school board consult educational\nexperts from the Office of Education of the United States\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare now be made\na mandatory requirement. See Alexander v. Holmes County\nBoard of Education, supra; United States v. Hinds County\nSchool Board, 417 F. 2d 852 (5th Cir. 1969) (per curiam);\nWhittenbeu v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.\ns\nSupp. 784 (D. S.C. 1969); Singleton v. Jackson Municipal\nSeparate School District, No. 26,285 (5th Cir., Dec. 1,\n1969) (en bane) (per curiam). We think that, in the\nevent that the case Is remanded for that purpose, it would\nbe appropriate for this Court to indicate some guidelines\nfor the formulation of a new plan, including,,for example,\ndirectives to consider techniques of drawing zone lines\nto promote rather than frustrate desegregation and\npairing, grouping, clustering, and school consolidation;\nany new plan should also take into account such resources\nas may be available to the school board to desegregate\nits system more fully. It would be appropriate for this\nCourt to provide a reasonable timetable within which a\n- 16 -\n\nfinal plan is to be approved well before commencement of\nthe 1970-1971 school year. Moreover, the district court\nshould retain jurisdiction until such time as \"it is\nclear that state-imposed racial segregation has been\ncompletely removed.\" Green v.

Accordingly, we here attempt, not to dear\nextensively with factual matters, but rather to set\nforth some legal considerations which may be helpful\nto the Court.\n•\n1•\n2\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe think that the principal problems which this\nCourt may need to address concern the adequacy of the\ndesegregation plan proposed by the school board and re-\njected in part by the district court and the appropriate\nways in which a district court might respond to a school\nboard's profferring unacceptable plans and proposals over\nan extended period of litigation.\nA. As we understand it, the school board's plan\nhere relies wholly on unitary, contiguous zoning and would\nmake all schools to which white students are assigned no\nmore than 40 percent Negro, leaving nine elementary schools\n(enrolling over one-half of the district's Negro ele-\nmentary students) and one junior high school virtually all-\nNegro. It appears that the zones of all but two Negro\nschools adjoin zones served by predominantly white schools.\nMarie Davis Elementary School, for example,  is one of the\n/ See maps, infra pp. 4-5.\n3\n\nlie c. 1,,,‘,y vos(cid:9) n0\n1.\".110,,,,......avIK■CP.31,70,..\nAsi,k.y Park\no N(cid:9) `10\n153 '121 11  \nre.\n13 cjoN\n:25c - 31/\n86L. e;\nN w \n3 l24V A39/\nW\n442 £'2.\nl/C‘ slot\nAfj h \n?,/r(cid:9)\nL\nMX.\nSeal • i,e.td\nN W\n.2.23 v6.1 3'\nD \nf G4 rt t e- e_(cid:9) V i 5(cid:9) Ct. ti\ne\nct. frit-% _e c. r(cid:9) a .7(cid:9) .\nr e..(cid:9) I.

Five other elementary schools (together\nenrolling 978 Negroes and 1803 whites) serve zones adjacent\nto the Marie Davis zone. Each of those schools would be.\nbetween 62 and , 73 percent white. • The same would he true\nof Piedmont Junior High School scheduled to be 90 percent\nNegro while no other junior high school in the system\nwould be more than 39 percent Negro.\nThis plan, of course, like any other desegregation\nplan, must be measured in terms of its effectiveness when\nviewed in light of such alternatives as may be available.\nGreen v. County  School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 439, 441 (1968);\nRaney v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 443, 447-48 (1963);\nMonroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U.S. 450, 459 (1968).\nUnitary zoning in our view, does go far toward disestablishing\na racially segregated, dual school system, see Ellis v.\nBoard of Public Instruction of Orange Countl, No. 29,124\n(5th Cir., Feb. 17, 1970), for it would, eliminate dual,\noverlapping attendance areas, \"[t]he central vice in a\nformerly de jure segregated public school system,\" United\n- 6\n\nStates v.

Those provisions\nare not, of course, prohibitions on either school boards\nor federal courts; for they were designed(cid:9) simply to\nremove any implication that the Civil Rights Act conferred\nnew jurisdiction on courts to deal with the constitutionally\nunsettled question of whether school boards were obligated\nto overcome purely adventitious, de facto segregation.\nSee, e.g., 110 Cong. Rec. 2280 (Congressman Cramer), 13820\n(Senator Humphrey), 13821 (Senator Javits); United States\nv. School District 151 404 F.2d 1125, 1130 (7th dir.\n1968); United States v. Jefferson Count Board of Educa-\ntion, 372 F.2d 836, 886 (5th Cir. 1966). The references\nsuggest however, that courts might carefully consider\nwhether, for the purpose of achieving a precise, system-\nwide racial balance, a plan would require a school board\n- 13 -\n\ninvoluntarily to make unreasonable increments in trans-\nportation expenditures, the number of students bused,\ndistances traveled, and the like. Thus, we think that\nthe question facing this Court is whether, in view\nof the district court's supplemental findings, the\ncircumstances of the case, and the alternatives reason-\nably available, the court below invoked a remedy so\nextreme as to constitute an abuse of discretion. The\ndifficulty in measuring the court's decree against the\nabove considerations is the absence of any other -accept-\nable plan in the record.\n\nC. This Court, then, may want to consider what\noptions are now available to the district court as a\nresult of changes in practical considerations of\ntiming. The district court, in its February 1970\ndecision, considered the mandates of the Supreme Court\nin Alexander v. Holmes Count Board of Education, supra,\nand Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, supra,\nand subsequent decisions of this Court, Nesbit v. States-\nville Ciy Board of Education, supra; Stanley v.-*-\nDarlington County School District, No. 13,904 (4th Cir.,\nJan. 19, 1970), as requiring immediate implementation of\na desegregation plan and, therefore, directed. the school\n•\nboard to implement the available plan which, in the\nCourt's view, was consistent with the board's constitutional\nobligations. As a practical matter, the stays recently\ngranted by this Court and the district court have obviated\nthe urgency in adopting a plan occasioned by the need for\nimplementation during this school year. Consequently, the\ndistrict court now has an opportunity to increase the\noptions available to it.\n- 15 -\n\nWe would suggest that the district court's earlier\nsuggestion that the school board consult educational\nexperts from the Office of Education of the United States\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare now be made\na mandatory requirement. See Alexander v. Holmes County\nBoard of Education, supra; United States v. Hinds County\nSchool Board, 417 F. 2d 852 (5th Cir. 1969) (per curiam);\nWhittenbeu v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.\ns\nSupp. 784 (D. S.C. 1969); Singleton v. Jackson Municipal\nSeparate School District, No. 26,285 (5th Cir., Dec. 1,\n1969) (en bane) (per curiam). We think that, in the\nevent that the case Is remanded for that purpose, it would\nbe appropriate for this Court to indicate some guidelines\nfor the formulation of a new plan, including,,for example,\ndirectives to consider techniques of drawing zone lines\nto promote rather than frustrate desegregation and\npairing, grouping, clustering, and school consolidation;\nany new plan should also take into account such resources\nas may be available to the school board to desegregate\nits system more fully. It would be appropriate for this\nCourt to provide a reasonable timetable within which a\n- 16 -\n\nfinal plan is to be approved well before commencement of\nthe 1970-1971 school year. Moreover, the district court\nshould retain jurisdiction until such time as \"it is\nclear that state-imposed racial segregation has been\ncompletely removed.\" Green v.

      "text": "136a \nSupplementary  Findings  of  Fact \ndated  March  21,  1970 \nPursuant  to  the  March  5,  1970  order  of  the  Fourth \nCircuit  Court  of  Appeals,  the  court  makes  the  following \nsupplemental  findings  of  fact: \n1.  Paragraph  seven  of this  court's  order  of  February  5, \n1970,  as  amended,  reads: \n\"7.  That  transportation  be  offered  on  a  uniform \nnon-racial  basis  to  all  children  whose  reassignment \nto  any  school  is  necessary  to  bring  about  the  reduc \ntion  of  segregation,  and  who  live  farther  from  the \nschool  to  which  they  are  assig'ned  than  the  Board \ndetermines  to  be  walking  distance.  Estimates  of  the \nnumber  of  children  who  may  have  to  be  transported \nhave  rUll  as  high  as  10,000  or  more.  Since  the  cost \nto  the  local  system  is  about $18  or 20  a  year  per pupil, \nand  the  cost  to  the  state  in  those  areas  where  the \nstate  provides  transportation  funds  is  about  another \n$18  or  $20  a  year  per  pupil,  the  average  cost  for \n$40 \ntransportation  is  apparently  less  than  per  pupil \nper year.  The  local  school  budget  is  about  $45,000,000 \nIt \na  year.  would  appear  that  transporting 10,000  addi \ntional  children,  if  that  is  necessary,  and  if  the  defen \ndants  had  to  pay  it  all,  would  add  less  than  one  per \ncent  to  the  local  cost  of  operating  the  schools.  The \nsignificant  point,  however,  is  that  cost  is  not  a  valid \nlegal  reason  for  continued  denial  of  constitutional \nrights.\" \n2.

There  has  been  a  sizeable \noperating  surplus  in  the  state  budget  for  every  biennium \nsince  1959-60  (State  Budget,  page  86). \n8.  The  state  superintendent  of  public  instruction  in  his \nbiennial  report  (Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  12)  for  the  years  1966-\n68  recommended  that  \"city  transportation  should  be  pro-\n\n140a \nSu,pplerncntal  Findillgs  of  Fact  dated  March  21,  1970 \nvided on  the  same basis as  transportation  for  rural  children \nas  a  matter  of  equity.\" \n9.  The 1969  report  of the  Governor's  Study  Commission \non  the  Public  School  System  of  North  Carolina  (Plaintiffs' \nExhibit  13)  recommellded  that  transportation  be  provided \nfor  all  school  ch.ildren,  city  as  welI  as  rural,  on  an  equal \nbasis.  Signatory  to  that  report  was  one  of  the  present  de \nfendants,  the  state  superintendent  of  public  instruetiOll. \n10.  The  basic support.  for  the  public  schools  of  the  state \ncomes  from  the  State  Legislature. \n11.  Some  5,000  children  travel  to  and  from  school  in \nMecklenhurg  County  each  day  in  busses  provided  by  con \ntract  carriers  such  as  Charlotte  City  Coach  Lines,  Inc. \n(Morgan's  deposition  of  February  25,  1970,  page  36). \n12.  Upon  the  basis  of data  furnished  by  the  school board \nand  on  the  basis  of  statistics  from  the  National  Safety \nCouncil,  it  is  found  as  a  fact  that  travel  hy  sehool  bus  is \nsafer  than  walking  or  than  riding  in  private  vehicles. \n13.  Traffic  is  of  course  heavy  all  over  the  540  square \nmiles  of  the  county.  Motor  vehicle  registration  fo!'  1969 \nwas  191,165  motor  vehicles  (161,678  automobiles  and  29,487 \ntrucks). \n14.  IVlany  children  eligible  for  transportation  do  not  ac \ncept  that  transportation.  Estimates  have  been  made  that \nthis  number of those  who  do  not accept  transportation is  in \nthe  neighborhood  of  50%  of  those  who  arc  eligible. \n\n141a \n81LppienwIllal  Findi'llps  of  Fact  da[.ed  March \n21,  1970 \n15.  Approximately  5,000  child ron  in  the  system  attend \nschool  outside  the  school  ZOllO  ill  which  t.hey  reside.  Al \nthough  requested  of  the  defendants  hy  the  court  on  Murch \n7,  1970,  information  as  to  whore  these  childrell  go  to  school \nhas not  been forthcoming  Hllcl  the  defendants have  indicated \nthat  it  is  impos:sible  to  produce  it. \n16.  As  the  transportation  regulatioJlsl.'  are  under \n~tate \nstood  hy  the  cOllrt,  the state will  bear  its  share  (about  half) \nof  transportation  co:sts  for  children  who  live  more  than \nI1h \nmiles  from  thei  school,  as follows: \nI' \n(a)  All  I'llral  children,  wherever  they  attend  school; \n(b)  Ali  perimeter  children  (those  living  in  territory \nannexed  by  the  city  hefore  1957),  wherever  they \nattend  school;  a1ld \n(c)  All  inner city children  assigned  to  schools  in  either \nthe  perimeter  t.he  rural  of  the  system. \n01'  ~1reas \n17.  The  defendants  submitted  information  on  the  num \n1Jh \nber  of  children  who  live  within  miles  of  the  schools \nwhich  are  to  he  desegregated  by  zoning.  This  information \nshows  that  East  1Iecklenhurg,  Independence,  North  Meck \nlenburg,  Olympic,  South  Mecklenhurg  and  West  lVIecklen \nhUl'g  high  schools,  and  Qua il  Hollow  and  Alexander  junior \nhigh  schools,  with  total  student  populations  of  12,184,  have \nin  the  aggregato  only  96  studCllts  who  live  within  IV::!  miles \nfrolll  the  schools.  Some  12,088  then  are  eligible  for  trans \nportation.  These  same  schools  among  them  provide  bus \ntransportation  for  5,349  students.

I t  \nalso  shows  the wide gap between  those  entitled  to  transpor \ntation  and  those  who  actually  claim  it.  There  is  no  black \nschool  ill  the  system  which  depends  very  much  upon  the \nschool  bus  to  get  the  children  to  school.  The  total  nnmber \nof  children  transported  in  October,  1969,  to  schools  identi \nfiable  as  black was  541  out of total  population  in  those  black \nschools  of  over  17,000.  Black  schools,  including  the  new \nblack  schools,  have been located  in  black areas where busses \nwould  be  unnecessary.  Subnrban  schOOls,  including  the \nnewest ones,  have  been  located far away from  black centers, \nand  where  they can  not  be  reached  by  many  students  with \nout transportation. \n18.  Bus  travel  in  both  urban  and  rural areas  takes  time. \nAn  analysis  of  the  records  of  bus  transportation,  based \nupon  the  reports  of  school  principals,  is  contained  in  the \nextensive  exhibits  bearing  Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  numbers  22, \n33,  24,  25,  26  and  27.  For  the  month  of  October,  1969,  by \nway  of  illustration,  these  principals' reports  when  analyzed \nshow  that out of some  279  busses ca rrying more than  23,000 \nchildren both  ways  each day: \nThe  average  one  way  trip  is  one  hour  and  fourteen \nminutes \ni \n80%  of  the  busses  require  more  than  one  hour  for  a \n• \none  way  tnp; \n75%  of  the  busses  make  two  or  more  trips  each  day; \nAverage  miles  traveled  by  busses  making  one  round \ntrip  per  day  is  34Ij:!;  and \nAverage  bus  mileage  per  day  for  busses  making  two \ntrips  is  47.99. \n\n.. \n-\n.  .. \nU3a \n8'llP1Jlem.en/.al  Findings  of  Fact,  dated  March \n21,  1P70 \n19.  It was  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Self and  DI·.  Finger,  and \nthe  courts  finch  as  a  fact,  that  transportation  provided  by \nthe  school  board's  plans,  which  include  narrow  corridors \nseveral  miles  long  in  places  only  one-half  mile  wide, \nillld \nproceeding  in  straight  lines  diagonally  across  streets  and \nother  obstacles,  would  be  more  expensive  capita  than \npCI' \ntransportation  under  the  satellite  zone  plan.  The  court \nplan  calls  for  pick-ups  to  be  marle  at  a  few  points  in  each \nscbool  district,  as  testified  to  by  Dr.  Self,  and  for  non-stop \nruns  to  be  mac.1e  between  satellite  ZOlles  and  principal zones. \nThere  will  be  no  serious  extra  load  on  downtown  traffic  be \ncause  therc  will  be  no  pick-up  and  discbarge  of  passengers \nin  downtowll  traffic  areas. \n20.  The court -finds  that from  the  standpoint  of  distance \ntl'avelled,  time  en  route  and  inconvenience,  the  children \nbussed  pursuant  to  the  court  order  will  not  as  a  group \ntravel  as  far,  nor  will  they  experience  more  inconvenience \nthan  the  more  than  28,000  children  who  are  already  being \ntransported  at state  expense. \nOn \n21.  July  29,  1969  (pUl'suant  to  the  court's  April  23, \n1969  order  that  they  frame  a  plan  for  desegregation  and \nthat school  busses  could  be  used as  needed),  the  defendants \nproposed  a  plan  for  closing  seven  inner-city  black  schools \nand  bussing  4,200  students  to  outlying  schools.  The  plan \nwas  approved,  It  had  some  escape  clauses  in  it,  and  the \ndefendants in  practice  added some others; but as  presented, \nand as approved  by the  court,  the  \"freedom  of  choice\"  con \ntemplated  was  very  narrowly  restricted;  and  bussing  of \nseveral  hundred  students  bas  taken  place  under  that  plan. \n22.  Evidence  of  property  valuations  produced  by  the \ndefendants  shows that the  value  of the seven  school  proper-\n\n, \n, \n144a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  19'70 \nties  closed  under  the  July  29,  1969  plan,  and  now  for  the \nmost  part  standing  idle,  was  over  three  million  dollars. \n23.  The  all-black  or  predominantly  black  elementary \n, \nschools  which  the  board  plan  would  retain  in  the  system \nare located in an almost  exclusively Negro  section  of  Char \n, \nlotte,  which  is very  roughly  triangular in  shape  and  meas \nures about four or five  miles  on  a  side.  Some  are air-condi \ntioned and most are modern. Virtually none of their patrons \nnow  ride  busses;  the  schools  were  located  where  the  black \npatrons  were  or  were  expected  to  be.  These  schools,  their \ncompletion  dates,  and  representative  academic  perfor \nmances  of  their  sixth  grade  graduating  classes  are  shown \nin  the  following  table: \n\n\n\n146a \nSupplemental  Fin-dings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21}  1970 \n24.  Both  Dr.  Finger  and  the  school  board  staff  appear \nto  have  agreed,  and  the  court  finds  as  a  fact,  that  for  the \npresent  at  least,  there  is  no  way  to  desegregate  the  a11-\nblack  schools  in  Northwest  Charlotte  without providing  (or \ncontinuing to provide)  bus or other t.ransportatiou for  thou \nsands  of  children.  .A.ll  plans  and  all  variations  of  plans \nconsidered  for  this  purpose  lead  in  one  fashion  or  another \nto  that  conclusion. \n25.  In  the  court's  order  of  April  23,  1969,  a  suggestion \nwas  made  that  the  board  seek  consultation  assistance \n01' \nfrom  the  office  of  Health,  Education  and  Welfare.  The \nboard  refused  to  do  tbis,  and  as  far  as  the  court  knows \nbas  not  sought  belp  fl'om  HEW. \n26.  Some  600  or  more  pupils  transfer  from  one  scbool \nto  another  or  register  for  the  first  time  into  the  system \nduring  the course  of  each  month  of  the  typical  school  year. \nI t  is  the  assignment  of  these  childl'cn  which  is  the  particu \nlar  subject  of  the  reference  in  paragraph  13  of  the  order \nto  the  malmer  of  handling  assignments  within  the  school \nyear. \n27.  No  plan for  the complete desegregation of the  schools \nwas  available  to  the  court  until  the  appointment  of  Dr. \nJohn  A.  FingcI',  Jr.  and  the  completion  of  his  tactful  and \neffective  work  with  the  school  administrative  staff  in  De \neember  1969  and  January  1970.  Dr.  Finger  has  a  degree \nin  science  from  1\\J assachllsetts  Institute  of  Technology  and \na  doctOT\"S  degree  in  education  from  Harvard  University, \nand  twenty  years'  experlence  in  eoucntion  and  educational \nproblems.  He  has worked  ill  a  number  of school  desegrega \ntion  cases  and  has  a  rare  capacity  for  perception  alld  solu \ntion  of  educational  problems.  His  work  with  the  staff  had \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n147a \nSupple'men.tal  of  Fact  dated  at'cll \n111  21,  19'10 \nFinding.~ \nthe  catalytic  effect  of  freeing  and  inducing  the  staff  to \nwork  diligently  in  the  preparation  of  plans  that  would \naccomplish  the  result  requil'ed,  and  which  would  be  co \nhesive  Rnd  efficient  from  Rn  educational  point  of  view. \n28.  Hearings  on  the  \"Finger\"  plans  and  on  the  board's \nproposed  plans  were  conducted  on  February  2  and  Febru \nary  5,  1970.  These  plans  may  best  be  understood  if  they \narc  considered  in  four  divisions: \n29.  The  plan  for  senior high  schools . . uThe  plan  ordered \nto  be  put  into  effect  May  4,  1970  is  the  board's  own  plan \ndesegregation  of  the  sellior  high  schools  in  all  pal'ticu \nfOl' \nlars  except  that  the  order  calls  for  the  assignment  to \nIndependence  High  School  of some  300  black  children.  The \nhoard contends the high  school  plans  will  call  for  additional \ntransportation for 2,497  students and  will  require 69  busses. \nThe court  is  unable  to  accept  this  view  of  the  evidence.  All \ntransportation  undel'  both  the  board  and  t.he  court  plan \n, \nis  COV(lred  by  state  law. \n30.  The  plan {01'  :;unior  high schools.  A  plan  for  junior \nhigh  schools  was  prepared  by  the  board  staff  and  Dr. \nFinger  and  was  submitted  to  the  court  as  Dr.  Finger's \nplan.  The  board  submitted  a  separate  plan.  Both  plans \nused  the  technique  of  re-zoning.  The  school  board's  plan \nafter  all  of  their  Te-zoning  had  been  done  left  Piedmont \n.Junior  High  School  9070  black  and  shifting  towards  100% \nblack.  The  plan  designed  by  Dr.  Finger  with  staff  assist \nance  included  zoning  in  such  a  way  as  to  desegregate  all \nthe  school!';.  This  zoning  wa!';  aided  by  a  technique  of \n\"satellite\"  districts.  For  example,  black  students  from \nsatellite  districts  in  the  central  city  area  around  Piedmont \nCourts  will  he  assigned  to  Alexander  Graham  Junior  High, \n\n148a \nSupplemental  of  Pact  dated \nPindinf}S  21,  1970 \n~llarch \nwhich is predominantly white.  Black :-;tudents fl'oll1  the area \naround  Northwest  Junior  High  School  (aU-black)  win  be \nsimilarly  transferred  to  Wilson  .Junior  High,  northwest  of \nthe  air  port.  These  one-way  transfers,  essentially  identical \nin  nature  to  the  board's  July  29,  1969  plalJ,  will  result  in \nthe  substantial desegregation  of all  the  junior  high  schools, \nwhich  are  left  under  this  plan  witb  black  student  popula \ntions  val·ying from  9%  at .J.  H.  Gunn  to  3370  at  Alexander \nand  Randolph. \nThe  court  order  did  not  require  the  adoptioll  of  the \nFinger  pIal!.  In  paragraph 19  of  the  order  the  board  were \ngiven  four  choices  of  action  to  complete  the  process  of \ndesegrcgating  the  junior  high  schools.  These  choices  were \n(1)  Re-zoning;  (2)  Two-way trallsporting of  pupils between \nPiedmont and  white  schools;  (3)  Closing Piedmont  and  as \nsigning  the  black  students  to  other  junior  high  schools;  or \n(4)  Adoption  of the  Finger  plan. \nThe  board  elected  to  adopt  and  tlid  adopt  the  FingeL' \nplan  by  rcsolution  February  9,  1970. \n011 \nthe \nThe defendants have offered  fig-tlres  on  basis of  which \nthey  ask  the  conrt  to  find  that  4,359  students  will  have  to \nbe  transported  nndor  the  junior  high  school  plan  and  that \n84  busses  will  be  required.  The  conrt  is  unable  to  find  that \nthese  contentions  arc  110me  out  by  the  r-;tatistics  and  other \n• \nevidence  offered. \nDr.  Self,  the  school  superintendent,  and  Dr.  Finger,  the \ncou rt  appOi]lted  expert,  hath  testifiE'd  that  the  tnmsporta \ntion  reCJuired  to implement  the  plan  for  junior  highs  wonld \nhe less expensive and  easier to arrange than  the tI\"aJl:;;porta \ntio11  proposed  nnder  the  hoard  plan.  The  conrt  finds  this \nto  be  a  fact. \nTwo  schools  may  be  nsed  to  illustrate  this  point.  Smith \n.J \nunior  High  under  the  board  plan  would  ha  a  contigl.l-\n\\Oe \n\n149a \nSupplemental  Fi'nciin!ls  of  Pact  dated  J:larch \n21,  1970 \nous  district  six  miles  in  length  extending  4Jj:,,!  miles  north \nfrom  the  school  itself.  The  district  throughout  the  greatcr \nportion  of  its  length  is  one-half  mile  wide  and  all  roads \nin its onc-half mile  width arc diagonal  to  its  borders.  J!:a:;t \nway  .Junior  High  presents  a  shape  somewhat  like  a  large \nwooden  pistol  with  a  fat  handlc  surrounding  the  school \notf  Central  Avenue  in  East  Charlotte  and  with  corridor \n11 \nextending  three  miles  north  and  thcn  extending'  at  right \nallgles  foul'  miles  west  to  draw  studcmts  from  the  Double \nOaks  al'en  in  northwest  eha dotte.

The  plan,  for  elemenim'Y  schools.  The  elementary \nschool  desegregation  program  is  best  understood  by  divid \ning it into two  parts:  (a)  The 27  schools  being desegregated \nby  zoning;  and  (b)  The  34  schools  being  desegregated  by \ngrouping, pairing and  transportation  hetween  school  zones. \n32.  The  re-zoned  group.  Two  plans  were  submitted  to \nthe  court.  The  school  board  plan  was  prepared  for  the \nboard  by  its  staff.  I t  relied  entirely  upon  zoning  with  the \naid  of  some  computer  data  supplied  by  Mr.  Weil,  a  board \nemployed  consultant.  It  did  as  much  as  could  reasonably \nbe  accomplished  by  re-zoning  school  boundaries.  I t  would \nleave  nine  elementary  schools  83%  to  10070  black.  (These \nschools  now  serve  6,462  students '\"  over  half  the  black  ele \nmentary  pupils.)  I t   would  leave  approximately  half  the \nwhite  elementary students  attending schools  which  are 86% \nto  100%  white.  In  short,  it  does  not  tackle  the  problem  of \nthe  black  elementary  schools  in  northwest  Charlotte. \nThe  \"Finger  plan\"  was  the  result  of  nearly  two  months \nof  detailed  work  and  conference  between  Dr.  Finger  and \nthe  school  administrative  staff.  Dr.  Finger  prepared  sev \neral  plans  to  deal  with  the  problem  within  the  guidelines \nset out in  the December  1,  1969  order.  Like  the  board  plan, \nthe  Finger  plan  does  as  much  by  l'c-zoning  school  atten \ndance  lines  as  can  reasonably  he  accomplished.  However, \nunlike  the  board  plan.  it  does  not  stop  there.  I t  goes  fur \nther and desegregates all  the  rest of  the  elementary  schools \nby  the  technique  of grouping  two  or  three  outlying  schools \nwith  onc  hlack  inner  city  school  by  transporting  black \nj \n\n151a \nFindings  of  Fact  dated  March \n81~pplemental  21,  1970 \nstudeJlts from grades onc through four to  the  outlying white \nand  by  transporting  wbite  students  from  the  fifth \n~chools; \nto \nand  sixth  grades  from  the  outlying  white  schools  the \ninner  city  black  school. \nThe \"Finger plan\"  itself  in  the  form  from  which  in  prin \nciple  the court approved  on  February 5,  1970,  was  prepared \nby  the  sl:hool  staff  and  was  filed  with  the  COUJ't  hy  repre \nsentatives  of  the  board  on  February  2,  1970.  I t  \nSCl1001 \nrepresents  the  combined  thought  of  D,'.  Finger  and  the \nschool administrative staff as to a  valid method for  promptly \ndesegregating  the  elementary  schools,  if  such  desegrega \ntion  is  required  by  law  to  be  accomplished, \nThis  plan  wns  drafted  by  the  staff  and  by  Dr.  Finger \nin  such  a  way  as  to  make  possible  immediate  desegregation \nif  it  should  be  ordered  by  an  appellate  court  in  line  with \nthen  cnrrent  opinions  of  appellate  courts, \nThe  testimony  of  the  school  superintendent,  Dr.  Self, \nwas,  and  the  conrt  finds  as  a  fact,  that  the  zoning  portion \nof the  plan  can  be  implemented  by April  1,  1970  along  edu \ncationally  sOllnd  lines  and  that  the  transportation  problems \npresented  by  the  zoning  portion  of  the  plan  can  he  solved \nwith  available  resources. \nThe  court  has  reviewed  the  statistics  supplied  to  it  by \nthe  original  defendants  with  ,'egaI'd  to  elementary  schools \nto  be  desegregated  by  re.zoning.  These  schools  have  been \nwith  a  ex \nzoned  compact  attendance  areas  and  with  few \nceptions  they  have  no  children  beyond  Ill:.!  miles  distance \nfrom  the school  to which  they  arc  assigned,  Although  some \ntransportation  will  be  required,  the amount  is  not  consider \nable  when  weigherl  against  the  already  existing \ncapacit~, \nsystem.  The  COl11't  that \nof  the  specifically  finds  not  morc \nthan  l,?OO  students  wil]  require  transportation  under  thif; \n• \nportion  of  the  program  and  that  the  hus  trips  would  be  so \n\n152a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated.  March \n21}  1970 \nshort  aud  multiple  hus  so  highly  practical  that \n10 \n1'11l1S \nschool  busses  or  less  wil1  be  adequate. \n33.  The  pairing  and  grouping  of  elem.entary  schools. \n34 \n- T h i s   part  of  the  plan  as  previously  described  would \ngroup  an  inner  city  hlack  school  with  two  or  more  outly \nillg  white  schools  and  assign  cbilJren  back  and  forth  be \ntween  the  two  so  that  desegregated  fifth  and  si.xth  grades \nwould  be  established  in  the  presently  black  schools  and  de \nsegregated  grades  one  through  four  would  be  established \nin  the  presently  white  schools.  The  estimate  of  Dr.  Finger \nand  Dr.  Self,  the  superintendent,  was  that  this  program \nwould  require  transporting  roughly  white  pupils  of \n;),000 \nfifth  and  sixth  grade  levels  into  inner  city  schools.  The \nboard  in  its  latest  estimate  puts  the  total  figure  at  10,206 . \n.T  nst  what  is  the  net  additional  number  of  students  to  be \nt.ransported  who  are  not  already  receiving  transportation \nis  open  to  considerable  question. \n34.  The  Disco·unt  Factors.·  The  court  accepts  at  face \nvalue,  for  the  most  part,  the  defendants'  evidence  of  mat \nters  of  independent  fact,  but  is  unable  to  agree  with  the \nopinions  Or  factual  conclusions  urged  by  counsel  as  to  the \nnumbers  of  additional  children  to  be  transported,  and  as \nto  the  cost  and  difficulty  of  school  bus  transportation.  The \ndefendants  in  their  presentation  have  interpreted  the  facts \nto  suggest  incollvenient  and  expensive  and  burdensome \nviews  of the court's order.  Their figures  must he  diSCOllnted \nin  light  of  various  factors,  all  shown  by  the  evidence,  as \nfollows: \n(a)  Some  children  daily  arc  provided  trans \n5,000 \nportation  on  City  Coach  Lines,  in  addition  to  the \n\n- -\n~------ --~-\n153a \nSupplemental  Fi'J/.di\"ll!]s  of  Fact.  dated  ilIa}\"ch \n21,  1970 \n23,600  and  morc  who  riric  school  busses,  Tuese  have \nnot  been  considered  in  the  defendants'  calculat.ions. \n(b)  Not  all  students eligiblc  for  tl'ansport.atioll  actu \nally  aecept  it.  The  board's  cstimates  of  transportation, \nhowever,  assnme  that  transportat.ion  must  he  provided \ndaily  for  all  eligihle  St.lldeJltS. \n(c)  Not  aU  )'cgistcred  stndellts  attend  all  8ehools \nevery  day.  The  board's  figlll'es  appeal'  to  assume  they \ndo.  Statewide,  average  daily  attendance  is  less  than \n9470  of  initial  registration. \n(d)  The  present  average  nllmber  of  students  trans \nported  trip,  and  from  school,  per  hus,  per \nround  to \nday,  is  mOl'e  than  83.  The  board's  esi:imates,  however, \na re  based  the  assnmption  tuat  they  can  transport \n011 \nonly  44  46  pupils,  round  trip,  per  bus,  per  day \n01' \nwhen  the  hus  serves  a  desegl'egation  role. \nBusses  being  avel'nge \n(0)  now  lHied  make  an  of  1.8 \nt.rips  per  day.  Board  estimates  to  implement  the  de \nsegregation  plan  contemplate  only  one  trip  per  bus \nper  day! \n(f)  The  average  one-way  bus  t1'i p  ill  the  system  to \nday  is  over  15 miles in  length  and  takes  nearly an  hour \nand a  quarter.  The average  length  of the  one-way  trips \nrequired  under  the  conrt approved  plan  for  elementary \nstudents  is  less  than  seven  miles,  and  would  appear \nto  require  not  over  35  minutes  at  the  most,  because  no \nstops  will  be  necessary  het-ween  schools. \nThe  board's  figures  do  not.  contemplate  using \n(g) \nbusses  for  more  than  one  load  of  I)(u:;sengers  morning \nor  afternoon.  Round  trips  instead  of  one-way  trips \nmorning  and  afternoon  could  eut  the  bus  reqnirement.s \nsharply. \n\n154a \nSttpplemcntal  Fi·ndings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \n(h)  The  numbel'  of  busses  required  can  be  reduced \n35%  to  50%  by  staggering  the  opening  and  closing \nhours  of schools  so  that multiple bus  trips can be made. \nThis method  is  not considered  in  the  board's estimates, \naceording  to  testimony  of  D.  :M:organ,  bus  superin \n,J, \ntendent. \nSubstantial  economies  may  reasonably  be  ex \n(i) \npected  when  all  phases  of  the  bussing  operation  have \nheen  coord inatcd  instead  of  heing  considered  sepa \nrately. \n(j)  III  estimating how  many children  live  more than \na  mile  and  a  half  from  schools,  and  therefore  are  en \ntitled  to  transportation,  t.he  board's  transportation  peo \nple  have  used  some  very  short  measurements.  As  the \ncourt  meaSures  the  maps,  very  few  of  the  students  in \nthe  re-zoned  elementary  schools,  for  example,  live \nmorc  than  I1h  miles  from  their  assigned  schools.  I f  \nthe  board  wants  to  transport  children  who  live  less \nthan  1%  miles  away  they  may,  but  if  they  do,  it  is \nbecause  of  a  board  decision  rather  than  because  of  the \ncourt's  order. \n(k)  Transportation  requirements  could  be  reduced \n1% \nby  raising  the  walking  distance  temporarily  from \nto  perhaps  1%  miles.  This  has  apparently  not  been \ntaken  into  account. \nTestimony  of  J.  D.  MOl'gan  shows  that  busses \n(1) \ncall  be  operated at a  25%  overload.  Thus  a  60-passen \ngel'  bus  (the  average  size)  can  if  necessary  transport \n75  children.  Some  busses  in  use  today  transport  far \nmore. \n35.  Findings  of  Fact  as  to  Required  Transportation. \nAfter  many  days  of  detailed  study  of  maps,  exhibits  and \n\n155a \nSupplemental  Findings  of  Fact  dated  March \n21,  1970 \nstatistics,  and  after  taking  into  account  all  the  evidence, \nincluding the  \"discount factors\"  mentioned  above,  the  court \nfinds  as  facts  that  the  maximum  number  of  additional  chil \ndren who  may conceivably  require transportation  under  the \ncourt  ordered  plans,  and  the  maximum  numbers  of  addi \ntional  busses  needed  are  as  follows: \nN ct  Additiollal  Number  of \nTra\"/lsportees  Busses  N eoded \nSenior  Highs \n1,500  20 \nJunior  Highs \n2,500  28 \nElemcntaries: \nRe-zoned \n1,300  10 \nPaired  and  Grouped \n8,000  80 \nTotals  13,300  138 \n36.  These children  (all  hut a  few  hundred at Hawthorne, \nPiedmont,  Alexander  Graham,  :Myers  Park  High  School, \ni f  \nas \nEastover,  West  Charlotte  and  a  few  other  places), \nsigned  to  the  designated  schools ..  are  entitled  to  tran.spor \ntation under  existin.g  state  law,  independent of and  regard \nof \nless  th1·S  court's  order  respecting  bussing. \n37.  The  court  also  finds  that  the  plan  proposed  by  the \nboard  would  have  required  transportation  for  at least 5,000 \nstudents  in  addition  to  those  now  being  transported. \n38.  8eparabi.lity.  Each  of  the  jour  pa.rts  of  the  deseg \nregation  plan  is  separable  fro1n  the  other.  The  re-zoning \nof  elementarics  can  proceed  independent  of  tlle  pairing \nand  grouping.  The  pairing  and  grouping  can  take  place \nindependent  of  all  other  steps.

The  Tim.e  Table.  The  Fcbrual'y  5,  1970  order  fol \nlowed  the  time  ta hIe  reqnested  by  the  defendants.  At  the \nFebruary  hearing,  the  !o;chool  board  attorney  requested \n2 \nuntil  April  I,  1970  to  desegregate  the  elementary  schools \n(T.  20);  he  requested  that  high  school  seniors  be  allowed \nto  graduate  where  they  arc  (T.  21)  he  proposed  continu \nj \ning  junior  high  students  and  grades  10  and  11  in  their \npresent  schools  until  the  third  week  before  the  end  of \nschool  (T.  21).  The  request  of  Dr.  Self,  the  school  super \nintendent,  was  identical  as  to  elcmentaries  and  12th  grad \ners;  he  preferred  to  transfer  10th  and  11 th  graders  about \ntwo  weeks  before  school  was  over  (T.  95).  Availability  of \ntransportation  the  only  caveat  voiced  at  the  hearing. \nwa~ \n40.  The  February  5  order  expressly  provided  that  \"ra \ncial  balance\"  was  not  required.  The  percentage  of  black \nstudents  ill  the  various  parts  of  the  plans  approved  vary \nat \nfrom  3%  black  at  Bain  to  41 %  black  Cornelius. \n41.  Cost.  Busses  cost  around  $5,400.00  each,  varying \naccording  to  size  and  equipment.  Total  cost  of 138  busses, \nif  that  many  are  needed,  would  therefore  he  about  $745,-\n200.00.  That  is  much  leRs  than  one  week's  portion  of  the \n:Mecklenbnrg'  school  budget.  Busses  last  1.0  to  15  years. \nThe  state  replaces  them  when  worn  out. \nSome  additional  employees  will  be  needed  if  the  trans \nportation  system  is  enlarged. \nDefendants  have  offered  various  estimates  of  large  in \ncreased  costs  for  administration,  parking,  maintenance, \ndriver  education  and  other  items.

However,  the \nevidence  shows  that  school  bus  systems  in  Charlotte  and \n• \nother  urlnlll  North  Carolina  counties  tcnd  t.o  operate  at \nlower  costs  per  student  than  rllral  systems.

A·vai.lability_  The  evidence  shows  that  the  defend \nant:  North  Carolina  Board  of Educa.tion  has  approximately \n40  bnllld  new  school  busses  and  375  used  busses  in  storage, \nawait.ing  orders  from  school  boards.

The Intervenors damage claims should be \nrejected by the Court for at least two reasons, both of which present pure issues of law \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 1 of 11\n511 \n\nthat do not require any prior evidentiary dctenninations by the Court, \nI.  Damages Are Not Available In Desegregation Cases \nFirst, as noted in the Swann plaintifTs' trial brief, school desegregation cases \niIlVolve equitable remedies alone, As noted by the Eighth Circuit,  \"[a] school \ndesegregation case differs from much other litigation in that the main action does not \nresult in a monetary recovery, , , The only award received by the plaintiffs in a \ndesegregation case is simply payment of their attomey's fees,\"  Jenkins v, Missouri, 967 \nF,2d 1248 (81\"CIr. 1992) \nThe Intervenors cannot point to a single reported school desegregation case \nawarding damages,  In their Brief, they cite two school cases in a footnote at the start of \ntheir discLlssion of \"constitutional injuries,\" (Graves \\',  Waltoll COllnt)' Bd of Education, \n,  , \n686 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir. 1982); Adams v. Baldwin COlllltl' Bd. of Education, 628 F,2d 895 \n(llJ8{))), as if to suggest that these cases involved damage claims, They did not. Nor can \nthe Intervenors cite any reported opinion disclissing damages based, as here, on \nallegations of discrimination against white students by a school system under a \ndesegregation decree,  Irthe Intervenors arc going to assert a right to damages, they \nshould be required to offer sOllie legal authority suppol1ing that claim in the school \ndesc\\(re\\;aliOn conlnt,  Thev cannot do so, \n...  .... \n~ \n2,  The Court's Continuing Orders Foreclose Any Damage Claims \nSecond, the eXisting court orders preclude the Intervenors legal claims, The \nIntervenors almost blithely assert an equal protection claim -- that they are being assigned \nto schools based upon their race,  Yet the court orders still  place in this case compel the \nIn \n2 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 2 of 11\n\nBoard to undertake the very conduct that the Intervenors allege han115 them.  Intervenors' \nBrief does not elaborate on how they can maintain their damage claims in light ofthe fact \nthat this Court iound that the school district practiced unconstitutional segregation and \nhas not yet relieved it of the remedial orders imposed pursuant to that finding.  Instead, \npage 18 contains a bald, sllnple assertion that the Board unconstitutionally uses race in \nstudent assignment because this is a \"de facIO desegregated system.\"  Intervenors' offer \nno case law describing how a school system achieves de facto unitary status.  As shown \nbelow. this assertion is not only unprecedented but completely contrary to express \nlanguage in Board oFEill/callOlI  Dowel!. 498 U.S. 237, 245, 112 L.Ed.2d 715. 727, III \nI'. \nS.C!. 63IJ (1991)  A school system cannot be unitary until declared so by a court after a \nprop~r JudiCial proceeding.  There has been no such declaration in this case. \na.  A Non-Unitary School System Has Affinnative ObligatIOns \nBecause the Board is under a continuing order compelling it to take steps to \nclnl1JJlatc diSCrimination, this lawsuit is in a profoundly different posture than one \nIJl\\ohJJlg a Clall11 against a voluntary aftirmativc action or remedial program.  As the \nEleventh Circuit noted emphatically in reference to the 1973 orders in the Troup County \ncase. a school board under court order to desegregate has specific affirmative duties over \nand above what the law otherwise requires. \nWe reject the argument of the Godfrey intervenors that the penn anent injunction \nwas merely an \"obey the law\" injunction, imposing upon Troup County merely the same \nohligations that all school systems have under the Constitution and other applicable laws. \nContrary to their argument, the instant pennanent injunction imposed upon Troup \nCounty ohligations over and above those fhat would be owed by a school system which \nhad never practiced de jure segregation or a school system which had achieved \"unitary \nstatus\" ..... A school system which had never practiced de lure segregation, or which had \nachieved \"unitary status.\" would not be subject to sllch obligations .......  Again, this is an \nobligation over and above what is p.s:!: 5e required by the Constitution and applicable laws. \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 3 of 11\n-------------------------\n-----_ \n__ \n... __ ..  ... _-... -.-. \n\nUlliled SIUles  Slate of Georgia,  n.4, NQ. 97-9199,1999 WL 193887 \nl'.  F.3d~_, \n(11'\"  Cir. 1999). \nThe permanent injunction in Troup County required the school district to maintain \nand provide space and transportation for majority to minority transfer programs, an \nobligation it could not be subject to without a finding of dejllre segregation or after a \nfinding of unitary status.  Id  Similar to this COllli's 1975 \"Swann SOllg\" Order, the \ndistrict court in the Troup County case placed that case on inactive status in 1973.  The \nfleventh Circuit made clear that those obligations under the order continued.  \"The 1( )73 \nOrder ... left the new pcnmment injunction in place for an indefinite period of time. \nlilliS, the 1973 Order obviously left the matter of dismissing the case until a later time \n(c.::;., upon reactivation of the case by either party).\"  lei., p. 10, slip opinion. \nB.  The Board Has Affirmative Obligations Under Swann \nLike the Troup County school system, eMS has remained under pemlanCtlt \ninjunctions, including specific orders regarding student assignment, imposed by the Court \nto remedy uncllnstitutional segregation.  Those injunctions compel the very actions \nregarding student assi::;nment which Intervenors complain are unlawfuL \nfor example, on February 5, I <)70, this Court specifically ordered: \n5.  That no school be operated with an all-black or predominantly black \nsllldent body. \n6.  That pupils of all grades be assigned in such a way that as ncarly as \npracticable the varioLls schools at various grade levels have about the same \nproportion of black and white students. \n(J' .  That the defendants mamtain a cOlltilluing control over the race of children \nin each school, just as was done for many decades before BrowlI v.  Board \nof Education, and maintain the racial make-up of each school (including \n4 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 4 of 11\n\nany new and any re-opened schools) to prevent any school form becoming \nracially identifiable. (emphasis added) \n13.  That the Board adopt and implement a continuing program, computerized \nor otherwise, of assigning pupils and teachers during the school year as \nwell as at the start of each ycar for the conscIous purpose of maintaining \neach school and each faculty in a condition of dcscgrcgation.( emphasis \nadded) \n16.  The duty imposed by the law and by this order is the desegregation of \nschools and the mailllen(lnce of that condition ..... (e mphasis added) \n17.  The choice or approval or pal1ial approval of any proposed desegregation \nplan is subject to all of the requirements and restrictions of the preceding \nsixteen paragraphs .. \n311  F. Supp. 265, 2()8-26<J.T'hat order was affirmcd on appeal by the Supreme Court. \nTwo months after the Supreme Court decision, on .I une 21, 1971, the District \nCOUri issucd an Order that read, III pm1: \n4.  The Defendants are enjoined and restrained from operating any school for \nany portion of a school year with a predominantly black student body. \nThe movcment of children 1'1'0111 one place to another within the \ncomll1unity and the 1110vel11ent of children into the coml11unity are not \n\\\\Ithin the control of the school board.  The assignment of those children \nto particular schools ~ within the total control of the school board.  The \ndefendants are therefore retrained from assigning a child to a school or \nallowing a child to go to a school other than the one he was attending at \nthe start of the school year, if the cumulative result of such an assignment \nIn any given perIod tends substantially to restore or to increase the degree \nof segregation in either the transferor or the transferee. \n328 F.Supp. 1346, 1349-1350. \nOn October 21, 1971, the District Co uri issued another Order, that included the \nfollowing command:  \"Defendants are expressly directed not again to put upon any order \nan interpretation which causes or tcnds toward segregation or rc-segregahon.\"  334 \nF.Supp.623.629. \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 5 of 11\n\nOn June 10. 1973, the Court entered a scathing Order. finding continuing \ndiscrimination in the district, including black children bearing the burden of student \nassignment changes, 362 F.Supp. 1223,1232, and ofmobilc classrooms being used to \nincrease capacity at outlying \"white\" schools, iel., at 1233.  The Court reasserted: \ni.  That the prevIous orders of this court affecting desegregation of schools \nremain in clIeet and be followed by defendants. \n2.  That defendants refrain from gIving any effect to the \"feeder\"  plan, or any \nother re-zoning plan, which in any way restncts or handicaps the \nassignment of pupils as necessary to comply with this order. \n4.  For the 1974-75 Ill1djo/lowing n'urs, defendants are directed to prepare a \nnew plan for pupil assignment and desegregated school operation \n(emphasis added) \n/d. at 1138. \nOn April 3. 1974, the District Court found that its order of February 5, 1970, \nwhich \"included among its remedial measures a direction that the defendants adopt and \nim  pkment a continuing program of pupil assignment t()r the purpose of maintaining the \nschools in a desegregated condition, ... has never been followed. ,.\"  Order, April 3, \n1974. p.  I.  The Coul1 directed the Board to cooperate with the Citizens AdVIsory Group \nto prepare a student assignment plan,  M. p, 4.  On July 30, 1lJ74, the Court approved \n\"guidelines, poliCies and plan,\" 379 F.Supp, 1102, 1105, including the use of countywide \noptional schools.  The  emphasized. \"!cjxcept as modified herein. all previolls \nCOLIrt \norders of COLIrt remain in effect.\"  Id \nThen, on July II, 1975, the Court put the case on the inactive docket, noting that \nthe \"case contains many orders of continuing efleet, and could be re-opened upon a \nproper showing, .. \"  67 F,R.D, 648, 649.  After thanking many persons involved, the \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 6 of 11\n\nCourt observed that the school system's \"duty to comply with existing court orders \nrespecting student assignment of course remains,\"  Id \nC.  The SWill/I! Orders Remain In Place \nAs 111 Troup County, the 1975 Order putting this case in inactive status left this \nCOllli's injunctions In place until the case was dismissed at a later time,  It has not yet \nbeen dismissed, so the injunctions remain in place,  United States v,  (icmgia reiterated \nthat the Troup County case could not be dismissed, and the permanent injunction could \nnot be lifted, until there was \"a/ltdicial deterlllination that the school district has \nimplemented a desegregation plan in good t~lith and that the vestiges of discrimination \nhave been eliminated to the extent practicable,\"  id., at II, eiling, Lee v,  ElOwah COllntv. \n%3 F,2d I,,) 16 ( II ,h Cir.

In open court last week, counsel \nda1l1a~cs, \nfor Intervenors asserted thaI there was no difference between a unitary and non-unitary \nschool district for purposes of their constitutional claims,  In fact there is a fundamental \ndi t'ference,  And it IS a difference that the Intervenors clearly recognize, \nThey acknowledge in their trial brief that unitary status is the \"threshold issue\" in \nthe case,  inte)'veno)'s Brief, p,  19,  They know that this Cou11'S determination of that \nIssue is the Iynchpin of this matter,  But they avoid any direct discussion of that threshold \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 7 of 11\n\nquestion's impact on their damage claims. They, instead, attempt to bypass the existing \ncourt orders to bring their damage claims. \nTheir discussion of \"Constitutional Injuries\" on pages 24 through 26 of their Brief \nrestates in each SLlbpart their predicate assumption necessary to establishing each damage \nclaim: that the court orders no longer apply to student assignment because \"CMS has \nbeen desegregated for many years in student assignment to the extent practicable.\"  !d. . at \n14 ~ 26, subparts 2(A) ~ 2(O)(each repeating same language).  [n other words, they \nreassert, aga1l1 without explication or citation to authority, their unelaborated claim on \npage I ~ that eMS has been defilclO unitary with regard to student assignment; that is, \nwithout any determination by a court. \nThe Intervenors' damage claim is premised on unprecedented jurisprudence  the \ndeclaratIon that the passage of time has created de/ilclo partial unitary status and voided \nthe continuing orders in this case without hearing or determination by this Court; and that \nthe Board acts unconstitutionally, as a result, in continuing to follow the Court's orders. \nThis concept not only has absolutely no basis in the lawaI' school desegregation; it is \ncompletely contrary to expressly held principles.  \"[AJ school district cannot be said to \nhale ,lchincd 'unitary status' unless it has eliminated the vestiges of prior discrimination \n([lid hus hl:'cll ([(ljllcilcaled (is slich Ihrollgh rhe properjudiciai procedures.\"  Board of \nfdllCilli()11 \\'.  f)()IIe1I, 498 U.S. 237, 245,112 LEd.2d 715, 727,111 S.C!. 630 \n(llJ91 )(cmphasis added). The need for an orderly judicial dismissal of the injunctive \norders, as opposed to th~ passag~ of time standard created out of thin air by the \nIntcncnors,  \"lfslIch a decree is to be temlinated or dissolved, (the original \nIS ObIIOUS. \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 8 of 11\n\nplaintiffs) as well as the school board are entitled to a like statement from the court.\"  ld., \n498 U.S. at 246,112 LEd.2d at 727. \nUnder Dowell and its progeny, including [jlliled States v.  Georgia, this Court's \norders remain in effect until the school district achieves unitary status pursuant to a \nproper Judicial proceeding.  To date, there has been no such proceeding.  The Intervenors' \nliterally unprecedented proposition that this Court's prior orders have been dissolved de \nlilc/o impliCItly concedes that if the court orders are still in effecl, Intervenors have no \nclaim for damages.  That is the reason they concoct that the orders have been dismissed \nor nullified with the passage of time.  The Intervenors assertion of delilcto unitary status \nis creative, but fabricated.  Because their damage claims depends on a completely \nullsupported and unsupportable legal premise, they fail as a matter of law. \n:\\otably, the Intervenors' brief does not identify a single decision that involves a \ndal11CltiC claim atiainst a court-ordered remedial plan, let alone a damage claim against a \nschool system ji,)r complying with an existing court order.  All of the case authority they \ncite: to argue \"compelling interests\" and \"narrow tailoring\"  involve attacks on voluntarv \naflirmativc action plans  not Court ordered ones.  Intervenors fail to address in any way \nwhatsoever the efrect of a court-ordered remedy on their constitutional analysis. See, e.g, \n1.'lIi/cd Slates v.  ParadisE', 480 US 149, 167,94 L.Ed2d 203, 221, 107 S.Ct. 1053 \n(I ')87)(coul1 finding of discrimination and subsequent remedial order provides \ncompelling interest in remedy).  Instead, they pretend, as they must, that the orders in \nthiS case have expired. \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 511   Filed 04/19/99   Page 9 of 11\n\nE.  The Sole Issue Is Unitary Status \nBecause they have no damage claims, the Intervenors' only possible legal claim is \nthat the school district should now be declared unitary. The Swann plaintiffs recognize \nthat unitary status is the issue before this Court.  And it is precisely because the unitary \nstatus inquiry is a matter in equIty that the Intervenors' do not have a claim for damages, \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court commented at the pretrial conference that the portion of the Swann \nplaintiffs' Proposed Issues addressing the damage question was \"presumptive,\"  In fact, it \nis the Intervenors claim for damages that is presumptive,  They presume that damages are \navailable in school desegregation cases,  They also presume that this Court's Injunctions \nregarding student assignment dissolved at some point in time without any determination \nand declaration by this Court that school system had achieved unitary,  Without any legal \n<luthonty to support either presumption, the Intervenors damage claims must be dismissed \nas a matter  flaw, \n0  #  (. .,  ___  , \nJ1  a. \nRespectfully submitted this  t( day of  19 \n/~ \nELAINE JONES \nDirector-Counsel  JAMES E, F  RGUS  I , N.CBar#: 1434 \n'\\iOR~1AN J.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 57 F.Supp.2d 228 (1999)   \n \n \ncommonly referred to as “Charlotte–Mecklenburg Schools” or “CMS.” For simplicity, the Court will refer to the school system as \n“CMS” throughout the opinion. \n \n2  Not surprisingly, the original plaintiffs in Swann no longer have children attending schools in the district. Therefore, after the Court \nreactivated Swann, counsel for the original Swann Plaintiffs substituted as class representatives Terry Belk and Dwayne Collins, \nboth of whom have children in the CMS system. (Order of 9/16/98 at 2.) Walter Gregory also was named as a substituted party but \nlost standing after he moved his family out of the state. (Order of 2/22/99 at 2.) \n \n3  In fact, the use of freedom of choice was explicitly endorsed by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \n(HEW). U.S. Office of Education, HEW, General Statement of Policies Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Respecting \nDesegregation of Elementary and Secondary Schools (April 1965); see United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 372 F.2d \n836, 889 (5th Cir.1966). \n \n4  Judge Craven was subsequently appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Swann v. Charlotte–\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 431 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.1970) (recusing himself in subsequent appellate review of Swann litigation). \n \n5  Dr. Finger, an expert in education administration from Providence, Rhode Island, had served as a witness for the Swarm Plaintiffs \nand thus had a familiarity with the case, The Fourth Circuit later cautioned that courts should avoid appointing a person who has \nappeared as a witness for one of the parties but determined that the error, if any, was harmless. Swann v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg \nBd. of Educ., 431 F.2d 138, 147–48 (4th Cir.1970). \n \n6  The technique of grouping and pairing involved matching an outlying white school attendance area with an inner-city black school \nattendance area, transporting black students from grades one through three to the outlying school, and transporting white students \nfrom the fourth through sixth grades to the inner-city black school. \n \n7  Trial exhibits arc cited throughout as “PX” for the Plaintiff–Intervenors’ exhibits, “DX” for the Swann Plaintiffs’ exhibits, and \n“DX” for CMS’s exhibits. Transcripts of the hearing held from April 19, 1999, through June 22, 1999, are cited throughout by \ndate, page, and witness. \n \n8  The Court defines the “inner city” as the central area of the county, bounded by I–85 to the north, Billy Graham Parkway to the \nwest, and Route 4 to the south and east. (DX 5 Attach. E (Foster Rpt.).) Surrounding the inner city is a doughnut-like “middle \nsuburban” ring, with an approximately fifteen-mile diameter. (Id.). The Court refers to the remaining area of the county as the \n“outer area.” (Id.) \n \n9  A magnet school is “a public elementary or secondary school ... that offers a special curriculum capable of attracting substantial \nnumbers of students of different racial backgrounds.” 20 U.S.C. § 7204 (1999). The special curricula offered in CMS’s magnet \nprogram include communication arts, Montessori, advanced math and science, visual and performing arts, classical studies, \ninternational baccalaureate, global studies, workplace training, finance, medical sciences, and foreign languages. (PX 43 (CMS \nMagnet Options 1998–99).) \n \n10  A stand alone school is located in a naturally integrated neighborhood with a contiguous attendance zone. (PX 6 at 5 (Tidwell \nRpt.).) A mid-point school draws on students from black and white neighborhoods and is located halfway between such \nneighborhoods. (id.) \n \n11  Of course, even a court’s equitable authority is limited in the sense that a court can only order that which is reasonable, feasible, \nand workable. Swann, 402 U.S. at 31, 91 S.Ct. at 1283. \n \n12  Of course, an all-black or predominately black school is not per se unconstitutional, Swann, 402 U.S. at 25–26, 91 S.Ct. at 1280–\n81, and it would be insidious to assume that a school which is all or predominately black is inherently inferior. To the contrary, \n“black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, \nsuccess, and achievement.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 122, 115 S.Ct. at 2065 (Thomas, J., concurring). The purpose of this guideline, \nrather, was to rid the system of its most conspicuous vestige of segregation. \n \n13  One finding that seems to contradict this interpretation is Judge McMillan’s observation, in 1969, that Elizabeth Elementary, which \nwas 58% black at the time, had “a substantial degree of apparently stabilized desegregation.” Id., at 1367–68. \n \n14  CMS recently acknowledged this aspect of the Swann orders, stating that “only an upper limit for Black enrollment was set, with \n  50 \n \n\n \nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 57 F.Supp.2d 228 (1999)   \n \n \nno reference to a lower limit.” (PX 93 at CM095416 (CMS Student Assignment Proposals 1996–97).) Regardless, “whenever \npossible the Board also used a lower limit of 15% below the K–6 Black enrollment.” (Id.) Thus, CMS used a lower limit only as a \nself-imposed “aspirational” goal. \n \n15  See, e.g., Reed v. Rhodes, 1 F.Supp. 2d 705, 716 (N.D.Ohio 1998) (stating that “the common standard used throughout the United \nStates” is “+/−20 percentage points of the percentage of black students enrolled in the District”); Stell v. Board of Public Educ., \n724 F.Supp. 1384, 1401 (S.D.Ga.1988) (applying a ±20% standard and observing that several other courts apply the same \nstandard). Based on several of Judge McMiilan’s findings, it could be argued that the acceptable variance from the district-wide \naverage is as high as ±25% to ±30%. After all, the Court approved of Bain when it was 26% below the district-wide average and \ncommended Elizabeth when it was 29% above the district-wide average. \n \n16  CMS provided complete student enrollment data by race, by grade, and by school from the 1978–79 school year to the beginning \nof the 1998–99 school year. (DX 3 (CMS Enrollment Rpts.).) Between 1970 and 1978, student enrollment data is incomplete. CMS \nprovided data only for the 1972–73 and 1974–75 school years. (PX 137 at 2, 4 (Armor Rpt.).) Using these data along with HEW–\nOCR enrollment data for 1970, Dr. Armor extrapolated the numbers to estimate enrollments for the missing years. (Id., at 2, 4.) \nThe Court accepts this unrebutted method as reasonable and as the best means available for getting the full picture. \n \n17  Elementary Schools: Ashley Park, Briarwood, Derira, Devonshire, Druid Hills, Highland, Oaklawn, Sedgefield, Shamrock \nGardens, Thomasboro, and Westerly Hills. Middle Schools: Cochrane, Eastway, J.T. Williams, Spaugh, and Wilson. High Schools: \nGaringer, Harding, Northwest, and West Charlotte. \n \n18  Elementary Schools: Bain, Clear Creek, Cornelius, Davidson Road, Huntersville, Lebanon Road, Long Creek, Mallard Creek, \nMatthews, McAlpine, and McKee. Middle Schools: Alexander, Davidson IB, Randolph, and South Charlotte. High Schools: East \nMecklenburg and Providence. \n \n19  Moreover, using the common ±20% standard, only nine schools (7%) exceed the standard for more than three years, and only \nfourteen schools (11%) fall below the standard for more than three years. Using the explicit Court standards—i.e., the upper limits \nof 50% black for secondary schools and +15% from the district-wide ratio for elementary schools—only twenty-one of the \ndistrict’s current schools (17%) are out of compliance for more than three years since 1970. \n \n20  Of course, this cannot be interpreted to mean that all of the remaining schools have been balanced for twenty-six years or more \nbecause many schools were built during the last two decades. \n \n21  Wilmore was closed in 1977. (PX 158 at CM035831 (Schools Closings List).) \n \n22  For example, Spaugh went from 72% black in 1991–92 to 42% black in 1992–93, (id.), which was the year it implemented a math, \nscience, and technology magnet program. (DX 5 Attach. B, Table 5 at 4 (Foster Rpt.).) \n \n23  In contrast to Judge McMillan’s warning about potential re. segregation from “optional schools” that did not have adequate \nsafeguards, such as transportation and notification, the effects seen here have not wreaked “havoc” on or resulted in “significant \njeopardy” to the underlying desegregation plan. Swann, 379 F.Supp. at 1103–04. To the contrary, magnet schools have had an \noverall effect of countering resegregntive trends, and a higher percentage of black students would have attended predominately \nblack schools had the magnet schools not existed. (PX 1 at 10 (CMS Staff Discussion Paper); PX 6 at 9, 22 Fig. 1 (Tidwell Rpt.).) \nFurthermore, Dr. Foster testified that CMS “kept an eye on [magnet transfers] so that there wouldn’t be a run on the bank so to \nspeak from any one school.” (Tr. 6/ at 88–89 (Test. of Dr. Gordon Foster).) The problem, in his view, is that CMS did not have \n9\nrigid controls in place. (Id., at 89.) \n \n24  These concerns did not modify any of the outstanding Swann orders. In fact, Swann remained inactive during the Martin case. \nAlso, the Court did not impose any new injunctive orders against CMS. \n \n25  The board ultimately accepted the gift by a vote of five to four. (SX 119 at 5 (CMS Board Minutes of 5/28/96).) The donated land \nis located in the Ballentine development in the southernmost part of the county, which is the region experiencing some of the most \nintense growth. (PX 138 at 6, Fig. 4 (Clark Rpt.).) Thousands of residential building permits had been issued in this area years \nbefore this land was donated. (PX 3 at CM073068 (CMS Board Minutes of 1/12/88).) The nearest schools are already seriously \novercrowded; McKee Elementary, for example, had to use twenty-four mobile classrooms last year. (DX 4 (CMS Capacity and \nUtilization Rpts. 1990–91 to 1998–99); Tr. 4/21 at 11–12 (Test. of Lindalyn Kakadelis).) \n \n  51 \n \n\n \nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 57 F.Supp.2d 228 (1999)   \n \n \n26  The majority of new schools built since 1980–fiften out of twenty-seven-have had racially balanced student bodies every year since \nthey have been open. (DX 3 (CMS Enrollment Rpts.).) Only two schools built since 1980—Morehead Elementary (one year old) \nand Winding Springs Elementary (four years old)—have even’ had black student bodies above +15% from the district-wide \naverage, though only by one to three percentage points. (Id.) Six new schools—Crown Point Elementary (six years old), Lebanon \nRoad Elementary (nine years old), Mallard Creek Elementary (twelve years old), McAlpine Elementary (thirteen years old), \nMcKee Elementary (ten years old), and Providence High (ten years old)—have gone in and out of balance since opening. (Id.) \nOnly four new schools—Elizabeth Lane Elementary (three years old), Crestdale Middle (one year old), Davidson IB Middle (five \nyears old), and South Charlotte Middle (seven years old)—have never had black populations above −15% from the district-wide \naverage. (Id.) Of these four schools, the black population was 16% during Crestdale’s first year and has ranged from 2–4% at \nElizabeth Lane, 24–26% at Davidson IB, and 12–19% at South Charlotte. (Id.) \n \n27  Long Creek is the only outer area school in the imbalanced-white category that is located in a census tract that was 50% to 75% \nwhite in 1990; however, the school closely borders a large census tract that was 75% to 95% white. Long Creek did not fall out of \nbalance until the 1991–92 school year and was back in balance with a 38% black population in the most recent school year. (Id.) \n \n28  Court excluded the plan on the grounds that the initial phase of the trial involved whether CMS had complied with the Swann \norders up to the time of the present lawsuit. (Order of 4/14/99.) The Court said it would consider the plan only if it found additional \nremedial action was needed. (Id.) The Court was especially concerned that the plan—which is purely speculative and based on \nnumerous contingencies—was introduced after the deadlines for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had expired, a \nviolation of the pretrial order. (Id.) \n \n29  Under such a plan, the school system would be divided up into large racially diverse geographic zones, and students could apply to \nany school in their designated zone, (Tr. 6/9 at 171 (Test, of Dr. Gordon Foster) (proffered).) CMS would give preferences to those \napplicants who live in walking distance of the school and those with siblings in the school. (Id.) The remaining seats would be \nfilled based on racial preferences with the goal of achieving a certain racial mix at each school. (Id. at 174.) \n \n30  The Court also ordered: “That teachers be assigned so that the competence and experience of teachers in formerly or recently black \nschools will not be inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the system.” Id. Compliance with this provision is \nanalyzed below as an ancillary quality of education issue. See supra part II.B.7.a. \n \n31  The Court does not include “special schools” in calculating faculty imbalance for the same reason that those schools are excluded \nfrom the student assignment analysis. See supra part I.B.l.b. Plus, “specialized faculty” are exempt from racial balancing \nrequirements. Swann, 311 F.Supp. at 268. A certain background would be needed for faculty that deal with students who are \nmentally or physically disabled or pregnant or who have severe disciplinary problems, It would be unfair to enforce a prescribed \nracial balance in such schools. Also, it is somewhat misleading to count them as imbalanced schools because the faculties for these \nprograms tend to be small, sometimes as few as four teachers. (See Tr. 5/19 at 55 (Test. of Calvin Wallace).) \n \n32  The Court’s analysis of the facilities Green factor does not encompass the issue of school siting, which is more appropriately \naddressed as an aspect of student assignment. See supra part II.B.1; see also Martin, 475 F.Supp. at 1328 (treating school siting as \nan aspect of pupil assignment). \n \n33  The surveys showed that parents overall, black and white, were satisfied with the facilities where they sent their children and that, \nin some categories, black parents were more satisfied than white parents. (Id. at 11–12.) \n \n34  Armor visited thirteen schools, spending roughly an hour at each one, and also drove by various others to get a “representative \nsample.” (Id. at 112–14.) He concluded that he was “impressed with the overall operations of these facilities.” (Id. at 113.) \n \n35  Curiously, Dr. Gardner was at a complete loss to explain what these standards were. (Id. at 147–50.) \n \n36  Booker insisted that the Board’s failure to direct employees to upgrade older schools also contributed to inequities. (Id.) Of course, \nthis still goes back to funding. Had there been sufficient funds, CMS would have been able to adequately address the inequities. \n \n37  Of course, PTA funding and other outside contributions, such as corporate donations, may cause disparities, but CMS has no \ncontrol over this. See Swann, 300 F.Supp. at 1366–67 (“Parents contribute to school projects through voluntary Parent–Teacher \nAssociations. This voluntary parental action is not racial discrimination against children whose parents are less able to make such \ncontributions, and it does not come about through state action.”). \n \n  52 \n \n\n \nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 57 F.Supp.2d 228 (1999)   \n \n \n38  On the other hand, the Court finds that the Plaintiff–Intervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent and \ncausation. \n \n39  Based on the racial identities of the CMS staff members who testified at trial, it is apparent that blacks hold many important \npositions of authority in the various areas of school operations. While this is obviously too small a sample size from which to base \nany conclusions, it simply shows that blacks occupy positions of influence in CMS’s administrative hierarchy. See Morgan, 831 \nF.2d at 321 (“Minority presence in the power structure is a factor that might be expected to help prevent regression to a dual \nsystem once the court’s presence is withdrawn.” (citing Riddick, 784 F.2d at 528)). \n \n40  The provision made students who transfer from one high school to another ineligible for high school athletics for one year. \n \n41  In arguing that prolonged supervision is needed due to the achievement gap, the Swann Plaintiffs rely heavily on the Eighth \nCircuit’s opinion in Jenkins, 122 F.3d 588. That opinion is puzzling considering that the Supreme Court had just reversed the \nEighth Circuit on the issue of student achievement disparities, stating that, on remand, “the District Court should sharply limit, if \nnot dispense with, its reliance on this factor.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 101, 115 S.Ct. at 2055. \n \n42  As regards SAT scores, from 1987, “the first year that ethnic comparisons were available from the College Board,” to 1997, blacks \nin CMS scored at or above the statewide average for blacks every year and scored above the national average for blacks every year \nfrom 1992 to 1996. PX 171 (CMS College Entrance Examination Board Results.) Meanwhile, whites in CMS scored above the \nstatewide average for whites every year but only scored above the national average for whites in 1994. (Id.) \n \n43  Other important SES factors include the age of mother at birth, birth weight, child-rearing practices, parents’ cognitive abilities, \nparents’ occupational backgrounds, parental interest and involvement, and so on. (PX 137 at 13 (Armor Rpt.).) See City of \nYonkers, 181 F.3d 301, 316–17. The evidence suggests that these other factors would be significant. A parental survey conducted \nby CMS at the start of the Murphy administration showed that black children, as compared to white children, generally were read \nto less, watched more television, and spent less time on homework. (Tr. 4/28 at 139–40 (Test. of Dan Saltrick).) Low parental \nexpectations for black students also appeared to be a pervasive problem. (Tr. at 17–18 (Test. of John Murphy).) Additionally, in the \nmost recent school year, roughly 40% of black children in kindergarten were previously identified in the Bright Beginnings \nprogram as educationally disadvantaged. (Tr. 4/20 at 45–50 (Test. of James Puckett).) Consequently, a large percentage of black \nchildren may lack the type of support system they need prior to entering the school system, and this can continue as those children \ngo through the system. \n \n44  Dr. Mickelson failed to candidly disclose the terms of compensation for her services. (Tr. 6/15 at 106–12, 120–22 (Test. of Dr. \nRosalyn Mickelson.) Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). In addition, she has had a long-standing relationship with CMS in “a number of \ncapacities,” including co-authoring the “Pupil Assignment Subcommittee Report” for the Committee of 25, a group assembled by \nCMS to examine school policies. (Tr. 6/15 at 122 (Test of Dr. Rosalyn Mickelson)); DX 128 (Committee of 25 Pupil Assignment \nRpt.) The reforms advocated in that report are similar to the reforms she advocates in this case. Finally, the language and format of \nDr. Mickelson’s report suggested that her work was not wholly independent and original. She insisted that, prior to filing her \nreport, she never had any contact with Dr. Trent, who offered conclusions that were overlapping in subject matter. (Tr. 6/15 at 97–\n106 (Test. of Dr. Rosalyn Mickelson).) Yet, the introduction and point headings in her report showed a strikingly verbatim \nsimilarity with Dr. Trent’s report. (Compare DX 8 (Mickelson Rpt,) with DX 10 (Trent Rpt.).) Dr. Mickelson emphatically slated \nthat all of the language in her report was her own and could offer no simple explanation for the resemblance. (Tr. 6/15 at 113–17 \n(Test of Dr. Rosalyn Mickelson).) \n \n45  In fact, CMS went too far in trying to achieve racial balance in its magnet schools by imposing a prescribed admissions quota that \nwas too inflexible. See infra part 11.C. \n \n46  Associate Superintendent Purser expressed such fear in her cross-examination: \nQ. But you think that if suddenly the Court declares the school system unitary, that all of those things that you have done are \ngoing to drop off, is that what you are telling this Judge? \nA. Yes, I think there would be a difference.... \n. . . . . \nQ. So, ma’am, this school system’s commitment to enhancing the educational opportunities of black students and increasing \ntheir academic achievement is something that this administration and this School Board is going to make sure happens \nregardless of what happens in this case, isn’t it? \nA. Yes, this School Board will in fact be focused. But again, the School Board will change, superintendents will change, the \npeople involved in this organization will change. \n  53 \n \n\n \nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 57 F.Supp.2d 228 (1999)   \n \n \nQ. But you don’t know what any future School Board or administration will do either way, do you? \nA. That’s exactly my point. \n(Tr. 6/14 at 98–101 (Test. of Susan Purser).) \n \n47  While the law of employment discrimination under Title VII is inapplicable to this case, an instructive principle from that context \nis that no racially discriminatory intent can be established by “stray remarks and isolated statements by those unconnected to the \nfinal decision-making process.” See Bodoy v. North Arundel Hosp., 945 F.Supp. 890, 895 (D.Md.1996), aff’d, 112 F.3d 508 (4th \nCir.1997). \n \n48  Just because the Court gave CMS “maximum discretion” does not mean that the Court should allow an abuse of discretion. “[T]he \nBrown Court made it abundantly clear that constitutional principles cannot take a back seat to the discretion of local school \nofficials in respect to matters such as the racial composition of student bodies.” Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 797 n. 3. \n \n49  Furthermore, magnets differ from optional schools in that magnets offer specialized curricula and thereby convey to a subset of \nstudents a benefit above and beyond the regular academic program. (See PX 43 (CMS Magnet Options 1998–99).) in this way, the \ncase at bar is distinguishable from the 1979 Martin case. See supra part I.B. In Martin, the Court rejected a challenge based on \nBakke to CMS’s race-conscious reassignment of students because, under that reassignment, all students were guaranteed admission \ninto schools of equal quality; the question was simply where. Martin, 475 F.Supp. at 1321. Here, the magnet school program, as \nadvertised by CMS, provides special benefits. (PX 43 (CMS Magnet Options 1998–99).) Thus, contrary to the situation in Martin \nstudents are being denied “opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of [ ] race.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 305, 98 S.Ct. \nat 2756. \n \n50  CMS argues that Cristina’s lottery number was high enough that she would not have obtained admission to Olde Providence even \nif race were not considered. (Tr. 6/14 at 68–69 (Test. of Susan Purser).) Likewise, Benjamin Gavreau, a child of one of the \nPlaintiff–Intervenors, had a lottery number that was too high to obtain admission at his magnet school of choice, Davidson IB, \neven if race were not considered. (Id. at 72.) This is not the proper standard for analyzing an equal protection violation. As stated \nby the Supreme Court in Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. \n656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 2303, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993): \nWhen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for \nmembers of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have \nobtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The ‘injury in fact’ in an equal protection case of this \nvariety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the \nbenefit. \nSee also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 280–81 n. 14, 98 S.Ct. at 2743 n. 14 (“[E]ven if Bakke had been unable to prove that he would have \nbeen admitted in the absence of the special program, it would not follow that he lacked standing.”). \n \n51  For example, CMS called Ed Crutchfield, CEO of First Union Bank, to testify that employees enter the workplace with a handicap \nif they attended schools that are all or virtually one race. (Tr. 6/9 at 12–14 (Test. of Ed Crutchfield).) Yet, Crutchfield also testified \nthat employees who attended historically black colleges are not limited in their potential for success. (Id. at 19.) Similarly, Jackie \nFishman, a CMS teacher, testified that racial diversity in essential to having meaningful discussions in the classroom, but her basis \nfor making such a statement was limited because she has never taught a class that was racially homogeneous. (Tr. 6/17 at 71–73 \n(Test. of Jackie Fishman).) \n \n52  In the interest of stability, this injunction shall not affect assignments for the 1999–2000 school year that are already in place at the \ntime of this order. \n \n53  The Swann Plaintiffs have acknowledged this point repeatedly. (Swann Pl.’s Trial Brf. at 26; Swann Pl.’s Supplemental Br. on \nDamages at 2; Swann Pl.’s Mot. Directed Verdict at 20.) \n \n \n\t\r  \n \n  54 \n ",

Brown v. Board \nof Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 490 (1954) (\"Brown I\"). During the twenty \nyears following the Supreme Court's mandate, the Charlotte \nMecklenburg Board of Education (\"CMS\" or the\"Boardlt resisted all \n) \nefforts to eXpedite desegregation, essentially arguing that, in light of \nthe centuries over which the dual system of education had come to \nfruition, the Board would need a proportional period of time to \ndevelop remedies aimed at correcting past wrongs. Faced with this \nintransigence, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in 1971 that \nthe Constitution required the Board to take affmnative measures, \nincluding the use of race-based ratios in student assignment, to eradi \ncate vestiges of  invidious discrimination. See Swann v. Charlotte \n~ts \nBd: of \nMecklenburg  Educ., 402 U.S. 1 (1971). \nFinally, in 1975, the Board began seeking to fulfill the Supreme \nCourt's mandate that public schools be desegregated with \"all deliber \nate speed.\" Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294,299 (1955) \n(\"Brown II\"). Today, with the Board having had less than twenty-six \nyears to implement appropriate remedies, we must decide whether the \ntask of desegregating the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools has reached \nits end. \nWe hold that it has not. Over the Board's own admission to the \ncontrary, the district court concluded that the school system had \nachieved unitary status across the board. While the district court made \nfindings sufficient to hold that CMS had achieved unitary status in \nsome respects, the court failed to adequately explore the return of pre \ndominantly one-race schools as a vestige of segregation, rendering its \nfmdings insufficient to conclude that CMS has achieved unitary status \nin every respect. \nIn an equally unprecedented ruling, the district court held that the \nschool system, although operating under court orders to desegregate \n6 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 6 of 128\n\nits schools, violated the Constitution by employing a magnet school \nprogram that considered race in student assignment. On the contrary, \nbecause the Board's expanded magnet schools program -- and the \nrace-sensitive method of student selection it employed -- was \nundertaken both to remedy the effects of past segregation and to com \nply with governing court orders, they did not and could not violate the \nConstitution. \nIn this appeal, we consider the above rulings along with a number \nof related issues. As explained below, we affirm in part, reverse in \npart, vacate in part, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nI. \nA. \nIn order to better understand the issues presented in this case, we \nmust briefly review our country's history of school desegregation liti \ngation, in which CMS has played a prominent role. \nEven after slavery\" had been abolished for almost a full century, \nAfrican-American children were, for the most part, either excluded \nfrom the public schools or educated separately from white children. \n\"In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some \nstates.\" Brown I, 347 U.S. at 490; see also Martin v. Charlotte \nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F. Supp. 1319, 1324 (W.D.N.C. 1979) \n(\"For three centuries racial segregation was the law of the land. H). \nIndeed, throughout the early part of the 1900s, CMS operated a segre \ngated school system within the safe harbor created by the Supreme \nCourt's doctrine of \"separate but equal\" articulated in Plessy v. Fergu \nson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). \nIn the middle of the 1900s, the Supreme Court began dismantling \nthe great wall of segregation constructed under the imprimatur of \nPlessy. The Court initially sought to determine whether various \"sepa \nrate\" African-American schools were genuinely \"equal\" to white \nschools by evaluating the quality of physical facilities, curricula, fac \nulty, and certain \"intangible\" considerations. See.  Sweatt v. \n~. \nPainter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents ofUniv. of \n7 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 7 of 128\n\nOkla., 332 U.S. 631 (1948). In each instance, the Court concluded \nthat they were not. Id. \nIn 1954, the Supreme Court at last overruled Plessy, declaring that \n\"in the field of public education the doctrine of • separate but equal' \nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" \nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 495. Just one year later, the Court mandated that \nfederal courts and school authorities take affirmative steps to achieve \ndesegregation. Brown n, 349 U.S. at 299. Specifically, federal courts \nwere to retain jurisdiction over desegregation cases during the period \nof transition, wielding their equitable powers to supervise school \nboards' efforts to effectuate integration. Id. at 300-01. One of the \nmost important obligations of the federal courts was to ensure that \nschool boards were proceeding in good faith to desegregate the public \nschools \"with all deliberate speed.\" Id. at 301. With these seminal \ndecisions -- Brown I and Brown II-- the Supreme Court promised \nthe citizens of this country, and particularly African-American chil \ndren, school systems \"in which all vestiges of enforced racial segrega \ntion have beeR eliminated.  Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, \ntI \n407 U.S. 451, 4.~_3 (1972). \nNotwithstanding the Court's repeated admonition that segregation \nand its vestiges be eliminated \"root and branch, \" Green v. County Sch. \nRd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430,437-48 (1968), many school \nboards -- CMS included -- adopted \"an all too familiar\" response to \nthe mandate of Brown n, interpreting \"all deliberate speed\" \"as giving \nlatitude to delay steps to desegregate.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. \n467,472 (1992). And so, lower federal courts, with the guidance and \noversight of the Supreme Court, began fashioning equitable remedies \nto contend with school board recalcitrance. For example, in Green, \nthe Supreme Court held that a \"freedom of choice\" plan, which per \nmitted students -- regardless of race -- to choose the school they \nwould attend, was by itself insufficient to meet the mandate of Brown. \n391 U.S. at 430. In so holding, the Court recognized that more inten \nsive efforts would be necessary in order to make \"meaningful and \nimmediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segrega \ntion.\" Id. at 439. Subsequently, in this very case, the Court approved \nsignificant federal court intervention into a school system in order to \neliminate segregation \"root and branch,\" including the busing of stu \ndents from schools close to their homes to schools farther away, the \n8 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 8 of 128\n\nuse of race-based \"mathematical ratios, \" and the alteration of student \nattendance zones. Swann, 402 U.S. at 15, 25,28, 3()\"31. \nThe Supreme Court has made clear, however, that a federal court's \n\"end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to \nrestore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that \nis operating in compliance with the Constitution. \" Freeman, 503 U.S. \nat 489. Hence, as a school system eliminates the vestiges of past offi \ncial segregation from certain facets of its operations, courts possess \nthe authority to relinquish supervision in a commensurate fashion. Id. \nat 489-91. \nIn this context, we examine the steps taken by CMS to eliminate \nthe vestiges of segregation. \nB. \n1. \nNorth Carolina'.s..most significant initial response to the mandate of \nn \nBrown  was the \"Pupil Assignment Act of 1955-56, under which \n[the Board had] the sole power to assign pupils to schools, and chil \ndren [were] required to attend the schools to which they [were] \nassigned.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecldenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F. \nSupp. 1358, 1361 (W.D.N.C. 1969). This was an ineffectual measure \n-- perhaps intentionally so - and by 1964, no more than a few dozen \n(out of more than 20,(00) African-American children in CMS were \nattending schools with white children. Id. at 1362. \n2. \nIn 1965, the parents of African-American children attending CMS \n(hereinafter the \"Swann plaintiffs\")} filed a class action seeking \ninjunctive relief, claiming that the Board's policies and practices were \nperpetuating a segregated school system. Swann v. Charlotte \nMecldenburg Bd. of Educ., 243 F. Supp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965). \n} Since this case was first filed in 1965. the various successor plaintiffs \nhave been referred to as the Swann plaintiffs, a practice we continue to \nobserve here. \n9 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 9 of 128\n\nOn July 14, 1965, the district court approved a Board-proposed plan \nthat closed certain black schools, built new schools, and established \nschool attendance zones based on neighborhoods. But the linchpin of \nthis plan was its grant of permission to each student -- regardless of \nrace -- to freely transfer to a different school (often described as a \n\"freedom of choice\" plan). Id. In approving this plan, the district court \nheld that CMS had no affirmative duty to \"increase the mixing of the \nraces n; instead, the Board s obligation under Brown n, according to \nI \nthe court, was to act without the intent to perpetuate segregation. Id. \nat 670. The following year, this Court affirmed the district court's \ninterpretation of Brown n. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenbur& Bd. \nof  369 F.2d 29,32 (4th Cir. 1966) (\"Whatever the Board may \nEdUC., \ndo in respdnse. to its own initiative or that of the community, we have \nheld that there is no constitutional requirement that it act with the con \nscious purpose of achieving the maximum mixture of the races in the \nschool population. If). \nHowever, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in \nGreen,  down a desegregation plan founded predomi \nwhic~.~ck \nnantlyon \"freedom of choice,\" it became clear that school boards did \npossess an aftirInArive obligation to desegregate, not merely an obli \ngation to implement race-neutral policies. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38. \nInvigorated by the developing law. the Swann plaintiffs promptly \nflIed a motion for further relief with the district court, seeking to \nexpedite the desegregation process. \n3. \nIn 1969. Judge James B. McMillan. newly assigned to the Swann \ncase,2 reexamined the Board's actions in light of Green and deter \nmined that its \"freedom of choice\" plan, when coupled with geo \ngraphic zoning, were \"not furthering desegregation.\" 300 F. Supp. at \n1372. On the fundamental matters of assigning students and faculty, \nand the siting of new schools, the court made the following fmdings: \n-Student assignment: The court noted that a ratio of seventy percent \nwhite students to thirty percent black students, which approxi-\n2 For clarity's sake, we will often refer within to the presiding district \njudge by name. \n10 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 10 of 128\n\nmated the ratio of white to black students in the county, tended to \naid \"better students [in holding] their pace, with substantial \nimprovement for the poorer students.\" .kL. at 1369. \n-Faculty assignment: Although faculty members were not being \nassigned with a discriminatory purpose, there was also \"no sus \ntained effort to desegregate faculties.\" Id. at 1370. The court \nordered CMS to work actively to integrate the faculties, so that \"a \nchild attending any school in the system will face about the same \nchances of having a black or a white teacher as he would in any \nother school.\" Id. \n-School siting: The court underscored that the desirability of imple \nmenting a \"neighborhood school\" policy, under which efforts were \nmade to locate schools in neighborhoods and within walking dis \ntance for children, could not override the constitutional duty to \ndesegregate. Id. at 1369. At the same time, CMS was not to avoid \nnew facilities in black neighborhoods . .kL. at 1371. \nloc~~g \nIn light of Greenj }udge McMillan also ordered CMS to submit a \nnew, amended desegregation plan, and he outlined certain possible \nremedies, including busing and re-zoning. Swann, 300 F. Supp. at \n1360; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp. \n1299, 1302 (W.D.N.C. 1969). \nOnce again, however, CMS was slow to respond, prompting Judge \nMcMillan to impose a deadline of August 4, 1969, by which the \nBoard was to submit a detailed desegregation plan to the court. \n~ \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F. Supp. 1381, \n1382, 1386 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS complied, and its proposed \ndesegregation plan appeared to accept, for the first time, the constitu \ntional duty to desegregate students, teachers, principals, and staffs .. ' at \nthe earliest possible date. '\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of \nEduc., 306 F. SUpp. 1291, 1293 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The Board's pro \nposed desegregation plan, approved by the district court on an interim \nbasis (\"interim desegregation plan\"), included programs for faculty \ndesegregation, the closing of seven all-black schools, and the reas \nsignment of pupils from the closed schools to outlying, predominantly \nwhite schools. Id. at 1298-99. In approving the plan on an interim \nbasis, the district court noted that black children were bearing a dis-\n11 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 11 of 128\n\nThe Finger Plan included several components. First, students were \nto be assigned \"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various \nschools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of \nblack and white students.\" Id. at 268. Second. \"no school [could] be \noperated with an all-black or predominantly black student body. \" IsL. \nThird, in redrawing the school system's attendance zones, the Board \nwas authorized to use bus transportation and noncontiguous \"satellite \nzones\"3 to accomplish its goals. Id. Fourth, the district court restricted \nthe student transfer policy in order to safeguard against resegregation. \nId. at 268-69. Fifth, the race of faculty members at each school had \nto approximate the ratio of black and white faculty members through \nout the system. Id. at 268. Sixth, the overall competence of teachers \nat formerly black schools could not be inferior to those at formerly \nwhite schools. Id. Finally  the district court mandated that the Board \nt \nmonitor and report on its progress in implementing the plan. IsL. at \n269. \nThe Finger Plan was challenged on several occasions and, in 1971, \nthe SuprenieCourt upheld it as a valid exercise of the district court's \nequitable powe(S:.Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32. Indeed, the Court specif \nically found that the district court's adoption of a student assignment \nplan that used race-based \"mathematical ratios\" as a starting point was \nwell within the court's \"equitable remedial discretion. \" Id. at 25. \nEven after the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, the district \ncourt found that the Board's desegregation efforts failed to meet con \nstitutional requirements. For example, Judge McMillan ordered stu \ndent assignment proposals revised in June 1971, finding that the \nproposals \"were discriminatory in detail and in overall result; they \n3 eMS used \"satellite zones\" in connection with elementary schools. \nUnder this method, students from a small geographic area located outside \nan elementary school's primary attendance area were assigned to that \nschool. J.A. 15571, 16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9 & n.3. The use \nof satellite zones was implemented by \"pairing\" elementary schools - \nstudents from a predominantly black neighborhood were bused to a \nschool in a predominantly white neighborhood for grades K-3, and stu \ndents from a predominantly white neighborhood were bused to a school \nin a predominantly black neighborhood for grades 4-6. J.A. 15571, \n16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9-10. \n13 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 12 of 128\n\nplaced increasing burdens upon black patrons while partially relieving \nwhite patrons of similar burdens. \" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nBd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346, 1347 (W.D.N.C. 1971). During the \n1971-72 and 1972-73 school years, the district court attempted a \n\"hands-otr' approach, leaving the Board to remedy problems as they \narose, but the court twice found that the Board still had not adopted \nsufficient measures to guard against resegregation and ensure that \nwhites were bearing an appropriate share of the desegregation burden. \nSee Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp. \n1223, 1230 (W.D.N.C. 1973); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. \nof Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.D.N.C. 1974); see also discussion of \nspecific findings infra. \nThe 1974 order expressed somewhat more optimism about the \nBoard's desegregation efforts. In that order, Judge McMillan \napproved a student assignment proposal that, if implemented prop \nerly, would result in \"a fair and stable school operation  and would \nII \npermit the court to close the case as an active matter. See 379 F. Supp. \nat 1103. The proposal made provisions for several \"optional schools\" \n-- schools that w:ould offer some specialized program or curriculum \nand thereby attract students of all races from across Charlotte and \nMecklenburg County. Although Judge McMillan approved the incor \nporation of these schools into the plan, he cautioned that the optional \nschools would be inconsistent with the school board's constitutional \nobligations if they merely served to re-institute \"freedom of choice.\" \nId. at 1104 (\"' Freedom of choice' was a synonym for segregation for \nmany years, and . . . it should not be resurrected at this late date sub \nnom.  'optional schools' without adequate safeguards against discrimi \nnatory results. \"). To ensure that the optional schools served their \nstated purpose of furthering the process of desegregation, Judge \nMcMillan decreed that \"optional school enrollments will be con \ntrolled starting with 1974 so that they ... have about or above 20% \nblack students.\" Id. \nFinally, in July 1975, over twenty years after the mandate of Brown \nn, \nJudge McMillan for the first time observed, albeit with reserva \ntions, that the Board was actually working toward desegregation: \n\"The new Board has taken a more positive attitude toward desegrega \ntion and has at last openly supported affmnative action to cope with \nrecurrent racial problems in pupil assignment.\" Swann v. Charlotte-\n14 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 13 of 128\n\nMecklenburg &t. of Educ., 67 F.R.D. 648, 649 (W.D.N.C. 1975). \nAlthough the district court cautioned that problems remained, the new \nvigor with which the Board was pursuing desegregation persuaded \nJudge McMillan to close Swann as an active matter of litigation and \nto remove it from the court's docket. Id. at 649-50. In so acting, the \ncourt reaffinned that its orders still stood: \"[t]his case contains many \norders of continuing effect, and could be re-opened upon proper \nshowing that those orders are not being observed.\" Id. at 649. \n4. \nBetween 1975 and 1992, two significant actions were taken in con \nnection with the CMS desegregation litigation. \na. \nFirst, in 1978, a group of white parents and children brought suit \nagainst CMS. seeking an order prohibiting the Board from assigning \nchildren pursUant to the Board's latest student-assignment plan. See \nMartin, 475 F. SJlpp. at 1320. The Martin plaintiffs claimed that the \nSupreme Court's then-recent decisions in Pasadena City &t. of Educ. \nv. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424,436 (1976), and University of Cal. Regents \nv. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265. 305 (1978), prohibited any consideration of \nrace in student assignment. 475 F. Supp. at 1321. The Swann plain \ntiffs intervened in Martin, joining the Board's opposition to the con \ntentions of the Martin plaintiffs. Id. \nA brief review of Spangler and Bakke is necessary to an under \nstanding of Martin. In Spangler. the Supreme Court held that because \nthe Pasadena Unified School District C'PUSD\") had achieved racial \nneutrality in its school attendance pattern, \"the District Court was not \nentitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each \nyear so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was main \ntained in perpetuity. \" 427 U.S. at 436. All parties in Spangler agreed \nthat the plan initially achieved racial neutrality in student attendance; \nnonetheless, the district court had believed it was empowered to annu \nally readjust school boundaries to ensure in perpetuity that there \nwould be no majority of any minority race at any Pasadena school. \nId. at 433,436.  In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that a public \nuniversity with no history of discrimination could not constitutionally \n15 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 14 of 128\n\nreserve sixteen out of one hundred admission slots for racial minori \nties. 438 U.S. at 319-20. In striking down this admissions plan, the \nCourt had made clear that \"[w]hen a classification denies an individ \nual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his \nrace or ethnic background, (it must] be regarded as [constitutionally] \nsuspect. \" Id. at 305. \nJudge McMillan, who retained jurisdiction over Swann and pre-\nsided over Mir.W!, first held that because CMShad not achieved \nracial neutrality in student attendance, consideration of race in student \nassignment policies was appropriate under Swann . See Martin v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenbura Bd. of Educ., 626 F.2d 1165 (4th Cir. 1980). \nHe explained that because the student assignment policy in the CMS \nschool system had been independently adopted by the Board, it was \nnot established, as the Spanaler policy had been, via judicial coercion \nor order. 475 F. Supp. at 1340-43. Second, Judge McMillan ruled that \n~ was inapposite to the claims of the M!r!ID plaintiffs. Specifi \ncally, the court reasoned that no child was being denied access to \nequal educational opportunity because of race, see id. at 1321, and the \nactions of the ~rd were therefore not constitutionally suspect under \nBakke. \nIn upholding the independent actions of the Board, Judge McMil-\nlan made several important findings. For example, he found that dis \ncrimination had not ended; indeed, it was this very finding that led the \ncourt to uphold the 1978 race-conscious student assignment policy. \nId. at 1346-47. Also, although for the first time the district court \npraised the efforts of the Board without reservation, it underscored yet \nagain the need for patience and continued efforts: \nIt took three centuries to develop a slave culture, to fight a \nbloody civil war. and to live through the century of racial \nturmoil after that war . \n••• \nThe culture and attitudes and results of three centuries of \nsegregation cannot be eliminated nor corrected in ten years. \nHuman nature and practices don t change that fast, even in \nI \nthe hands of people of good will like the members of the \n16 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 15 of 128\n\npresent School Board. They need time to work their own \nexperiments, and to fmd their own ways of producing the \nsustained operation of a system of schools in which racial \ndiscrimination will play no part. I vote to uphold their \nefforts to date, and to give them that time. \n-Id. at 1347. In 1980, we affinned the district court's decision in -Ma-r-\ntin. See 626 F.2d at 1165. \nb. \nThe second significant phase of litigation between 1975 and 1992 \nwas initiated in 1980. At that time, eMS and the ~ plaintiffs \nnotified the district court that the black student population in eMS \nelementary schools had grown from twenty-nine percent to forty per \ncent, making it increasingly difficult to comply with the desegregation \norder's mandate to avoid majority-black elementary schools. In \nresponse to this change, Judge McMillan approved a modification to \nthe desegregation plan. Instead of prohibiting a \"predominantly black \nstudent body,\"  court permitted eMS to operate elementary \n~ \nschools with a black student population of \"plus 15 percent\" above \nthe district-wide average. Thus, if the school district averaged forty \npercent black students, any individual school could have fifty-five \npercent black students. \n5. \nFrom 1981 to 1992, the Board continued to operate its desegrega \ntion plan as approved by the district court, focusing, inter alia, on sat \nellite attendance zones. a feeder plan (assigning middle-school \nstudents from a certain neighborhood to identified high schools), \nschool closings. and construction of new schools. Then, in 1992, \neMS substantially increased its reliance on \"optional\" or magnet \nschools (the \"expanded magnet schools program\"). The Board placed \nnew emphasis on magnet schools in order to phase out\"pairing\" and \nheavy reliance on busing, and to give parents more choice in school \nselection. It was the expanded magnet schools program that ultimately \nled to the present phase of this litigation. \n17 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 16 of 128\n\n6. \nIn September 1997. William Capacchione, individually and on \nbehalf of his daughter Christina, sued CMS claiming that Christina \nwas unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school. Chris \ntina is Hispanic and Caucasian, and her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nsought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. In response, \nCMS moved to dismiss Capacchione's suit and, almost simulta \nneously, the Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann, claiming \nthat CMS was not yet in compliance with past desegregation orders \nand had not yet achieved unitary status. Because Judge McMillan had \ndied, the cases were assigned to Senior Judge Robert D. Potter, who \nrestored Swann to the district court's docket, consolidated the cases, \ndenied CMS's motion to dismiss, and granted Capacchione's motion \nto intervene.4 \nThe Capacchione plaintiffs claimed that eMS had long since elim \ninated the vestiges of segregation in its schools, and that its formerly \ndual system of white and black schools had, for some time, been uni \ntary. They also contended that CMS, while still operating under the \ncourt's desegreg~iion orders, had violated those orders and the consti \ntutional rights of white students in its efforts to desegregate the school \nsystem by employing a race-conscious assignment lottery in its \nexpanded magnet schools program. The Swann plaintiffs countered \nthat the school system had not yet achieved unitary status. CMS \nacknowledged that it was not yet in compliance with past desegrega \ntion orders and agreed that it should not be declared to have achieved \nunitary status. CMS also contended that, in any event, the expanded \nmagnet schools program constituted an entirely constitutional and \n4 Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based \non that fact and other findings, the district court determined that William \nCapacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declara \ntory relief, but that he did have standing to pursue compensatory relief. \nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228,240 \n(W.D.N.C. 1999). Another group of white parents intervened in the con \nsolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant, \nclaimed that CMS has achieved unitary status. The various groups of \nplaintiffs that have joined in Capacchione's claims are hereinafter \nreferred to as \"the Capacchione plaintiffs. \" \n18 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 17 of 128\n\nappropriate integration tool authorized under the desegregation orders \nin this case. The Swann plaintiffs, while endorsing the concept of \nmagnet schools, argued that the expanded magnet schools program, \nas implemented, was contributing to the resegregation of the school \nsystem. \nFollowing a bench trial conducted from April 19 to June 22, 1999, \nthe court, on September 9, 1999, ftted its Memorandum of Decision \nand Order, from which this appeal is taken. See Capacchione v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburt: Sch., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228 (W.D.N.C. 1999). \nAlthough the Board claimed that unitary status had not been achieved, \nthe district court found that it had. In its ruling, the district court then \nfound that the Board's expanded magnet schools program, even \nthough instituted to effect court-ordered desegregation, was unconsti \ntutional. Furthermore, the court enjoined the Board from \"assigning \nchildren to schools or allocating educational opportunities and bene \nfits through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides. or other \nmeans that deny students an equal footing based on race.\" Id. at 294. \nFinally, the cOurt awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs nominal mone \ntary damages ~substantial attorney's fees. \nFollowing the filing of timely notices of appeal, the Swann plain-\ntiffs and CMS sought a stay of Judge Potter's September 9, 1999 \ninjunction. On December 30, 1999, we granted the requested stay \npending further order of this court. Thereafter, the Capacchione plain \ntiffs petitioned for an initial hearing en banc, which was denied by an \neight-to-three vote of the Court. Belt v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. \nof Educ., 211 F.3d 853 (4th Cir. 2(00). The panel heard argument in \nthese appeals on June 7, 2000. \nc. \nWe are now called upon to review the district court's various deter \nminations relating to these consolidated appeals. Having reviewed \nand carefully considered each of the important questions determined. \nby the district court, we affirm in part; however, we must reverse in \npart, and we must vacate and remand on certain issues. \nThe district court's findings suffice to uphold its determination that \nthe Board achieved progress toward desegregation in the 19705 and \n19 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 18 of 128\n\n19808, and the court was therefore justified in concluding that CMS \nhad achieved unitary status in some respects. However, the district \ncourt's fmdings do not support its conclusion that CMS has attained \nunitary status in every respect. Moreover, even if CMS could now \nproperly be found to have achieved unitary status in toto, it would be \ninappropriate to assess the expanded magnet schools program as if \nthere had been no court order in place. The expanded magnet schools \nprogram and the race-conscious lottery it employed were undertaken \nto remedy the effects of past segregation and were in compliance with \ncourt orders governing this case; they do not violate the Constitution. \nConsequently, the award of nominal damages, substantial attorney's \nfees, and an overbroad injunction barring any future consideration of \nrace in school assignments and other fundamental aspects of school \noperations cannot stand. \nII. \nWe first address the district court's unitary status decision. The \ndetermination·~f whether any part of a school system has achieved \nunitary status is ;l_factual one; therefore, we review the district court's \nfindings as to unitary status for clear error. See Riddick v. School Bd. \nof the City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521,533 (4th Cir. 1986); see also \nJacksonville Branch. NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 883 F.2d \n945,952 n.3 (lIth Cir. 1989) (citing United States v. Texas Educ. \nAgency, 647 F.2d 504,506 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981». We do not, how \never, defer to the district court on conclusions of law, including the \ndistrict court's understanding of controUing law or the various bur \ndens of proof and presumptions; consequently, we review any such \nconclusions of law de novo. See, ~. In re Brice, 188 F.3d 576, 577 \n(4th Cir. 1999). \nA. \n1. \nIndisputably, the school system of Charlotte-Mecklenburg County \nsubjected African-Americans to nearly a century of segregation and \ndiscrimination. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized as much in \nSwann, noting that North Carolina was one of the states with \"a long \nhistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system \n20 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 19 of 128\n\ndeliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate \npupils in schools solely on the basis of race. \" 402 U.S. at 5-6. In this \ncontext the remedies forcefully endorsed in Brown II, including the \nuse of race conscious measures, are necessary to eradicate the invidi \nous segregation at which they are aimed. \nMoreover, court supervision over local school boards, also \nembraced in Brown and its progeny, is entirely appropriate whenever \n\"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations\" \"to take what \never steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which \nracial discrimination would be eliminated.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. \nNot only are the federal courts entitled to supervise and direct the \nactions of local school boards under those circumstances, but the \nscope of federal authority is almost plenary: \"Once a right and a vio \nlation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable pow \ners to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are \ninherent in equitable remedies. \" hi.:. There is no doubt that eMS was \njustifiably subjected to federal court supervision; in fact, even after \nthe Board had been subjected to court supervision, it had to be repeat \nedly ordered to  the process of desegregation. \n_~gin \nUltimately, however, the goal in a desegregation case such as this \nis to reach the point at which federal supervision is no longer war-\nranted and the use of race-conscious measures is no longer necessary. \nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. The Supreme Court has identified six \nfactors (collectively the \"original Green factors\") that must be free \nfrom racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is met: (1) \nstudent assignment, (2) physical facilities, (3) transportation, (4) fac \nulty, (5) staff, and (6) extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at \n435. Not only are reviewing courts to ascertain whether these original \nGreen factors are free from racial discrimination, but courts also are \nentitled, in their discretion, to identify other factors (\"ancillary factors\")5 \nand \"determine whether minority students were being disadvantaged \nin ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies to \nensure full compliance with the court's decree.\" 503 U.S. at 492. \n5 For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancil \nlary factors identified by the district court as \"Green factors.\" \n21 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 20 of 128\n\n2. \nFor school systems proceeding through the difficult process of \ndesegregation, the Supreme Court has adopted the goal of achieving \nunitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486-87; Board of FAuc. of Okla. \nCity Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-46 (1991). Although \nprior to the Court's Dowell and Freeman decisions federal courts used \nthe tenn \"unitary status\" somewhat inconsistently. see Freeman, 503 \nU.S. at 486-87; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, the tenn has now come \nto mean that the school system has been unified such that the vestiges \nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Free \n!Dim. 503 U.S. at 487;~. 391 U.S. at 437-38. When a school sys \ntem acbie\\'es unitary status, federal courts must withdraw supervision \nover the local school board. \nIn this case, Judge Potter declared that CMS had achieved unitary \nstatus in every respect. The Supreme Court has directed that an appel \nlate court review a district court's unitary status detennination by \napplying a two-part inquiry (the \"Freeman inquiries\"). An appellate \ncourt must detennine if (1) a school Board has, in good faith, com \nplied with the deSegregation decree since it was entered; and (2) the \nvestiges of de jure segregation in the school system have been elimi \nnated to the extent practicable. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing \nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50). \nIf the party seeking a declaration of unitary status cannot demon \nstrate that the school system has achieved unitary status in its entirety, \nwe then undertake to detennine whether the school system has \nachieved unitary status with respect to one or some of the Green fac \ntors (\"partial unitary status\"). At that point, we apply, with respect to \neach Green factor. the two Freeman inquiries along with one addi \ntional Freeman-mandated inquiry: \"whether retention of judicial con \ntrol [over one aspect of the school system] is necessary or practicable \nto achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school \nsystem.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. This third Freeman inquiry rec \nognizes that the Green factors are -- to a great extent -- interrelated, \nand when detennining whether judicial supervision over a school \nboard may be withdrawn, the overlap between the Green factors is a \ncrucial consideration. \n22 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 21 of 128\n\nThe Freeman analysis brings us to the most difficult questions \npresented in any desegregation case: whether present racial isolation \nis a vestige of past segregation and, if so, whether a school board can \npracticably reduce that racial isolation. It is even difficult to define \n\"vestige\" in this context. See id. at 502 (Scalia, 1., concurring) (\"We \nhave never sought to describe how one identifies . . . a •v estige' or \na 'remnant' of past .... H). The vestiges \"that are the concern of the \nlaw may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they must be so real \nthat they have a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied. \" \nhL. at 496 (Kennedy, J.); see also id. at 512 (Souter, 1., concurring) \n(citing Colnmim Bel. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449,46' & n.13 \n(1979). and Keyes v. School Dist. No.1, Denver, 413 U.S. 189. 211 \n& n.17 (1973» (court must order affinnative remedy where school \nboard's conduct \"create[d] or contribute[d] to\" racial identifiability of \nschools). We adhere to the most common-sense meaning of \"vestige\": \nit is a condition or occurrence causally related to the former de jure \nsystem of segregation. \nBecause a School system's duty to eliminate such vestiges is \nrestricted by the ~yailability of practicable measures for doing so, ~ \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492, it is also incumbent on us to consider prac \nticability. In determining the practicability of further measures, the \ndistrict court must look to numerous indicia of the system's operation. \nPracticability depends on the feasibility of the proposed method, from \nboth a financial and an administrative perspective. Cf. id. at 481-83, \n493-97. Whether a measure is practicable also depends on whether it \nis \"directed to curing the effects of the specific violation,\" and \nwhether it is likely to do so. Id. at 497. \nOur duty, in reviewing Judge Potter's decision, see Capacchione, \n57 F. Supp. 2d at 228, is clear. We must examine each Green factor \nand ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved with respect \nto any or all of them. Because the district court declared the entire \neMS school system to have achieved unitary status, we must assess, \nwith respect to each Green factor, whether the Board has complied, \nin good faith, with the desegregation decree and whether the vestiges \nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. ~ \nFreeman,503 U.S. at 492 (citing Dowell. 498 U.S. at 249-50). If the \nschool system has not achieved unitary status in its entirety. then, \n23 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 22 of 128\n\nconsistent with Freeman, we also must weigh the degree of interre \nlatedness existing between the various Green factors. \nB. \nBy way of introduction to our analysis of this case, we first address \na fundamental flaw in the district court's proceedings -- a flaw aris \ning from the district court's failure to give any consideration to a \nremedial plan sought to be admitted as evidence by CMS. Following \nthe filing of the Capacchione plaintiffs  Complaint in Intervention, \nI \nthe Board undertook to produce a comprehensive analysis of whether \nvestiges of de jure segregation existed in CMS and whether any such \nvestiges could be practicably remedied. The Board analyzed available \ndata and identified several vestiges remaining; then, in line with the \nmandate of Freeman, the Superintendent of CMS developed a plan \ncontaining practicable remedial steps. The Board independently \nreviewed this plan and, on March 30, 1999, adopted the \"Charlotte \nMecklenburg Schools' Remedial Plan to Address the Remaining Ves \ntiges of Segregation\" (the \"Plan\" or \"Remedial Plan\"). I.A. 11029. \nof.l:\" \nConsistent with pretrial deadlines, CMS filed the Remedial Plan \nwith the district court as a potential exhibit at trial. lA. 11028. At the \npretrial conference conducted on April 13, 1999, the Capacchione \nplaintiffs moved in limine to exclude the Remedial Plan. In essence, \nthe Capacchione plaintiffs maintained that the trial had been bifur \ncated into two phases and that only unitary status was at issue in the \nfITSt phase. They further maintained that the Remedial Plan contained \nproposed remedies that could only be implemented if CMS was deter \nmined not to have achieved unitary status. Because the unitary status \nquestion had not yet been resolved, they claimed that the Remedial \nPlan (which the Capacchione plaintiffs characterized as a damages \nreport) was irrelevant. \nIn opposing exclusion of the Remedial Plan, CMS and the Swann \nplaintiffs relied on the Supreme Court's Freeman analysis. I.A. 1421. \nSpecifically, they asserted that each unitary status determination \nencompassed in the first phase of the trial turned on \"whether the ves \ntiges have been remedied to the extent practicable.\" Id. (emphasis \nadded). The Remedial Plan, they claimed, was not merely relevant, \n24 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 23 of 128\n\nbut crucial, to establishing both the existence of vestiges of segrega \ntion and the practicability of remedial measures. \nJudge Potter responded with two rulings. First, Judge Potter \nexplained in assessing whether CMS had achieved unitary status that \nhe believed Freeman required him to consider just one thing: \"only \n... what CMS has done, not what it may do in the future.\" See Order \nof April 14, 1999 at 4. Second, based on.this understanding of Free \n~ and the unitary status test, Judge Potter concluded that the Reme \ndial Plan was irrelevant: \"If the Court later determines that additional \nremedial measures are needed, it may consider the plan. Until that \ntime comes, however, the Court will not get mired in the complex \ndetails and mechanics of a proposed plan.\" Id. at 5.6 \nWe believe Judge Potter erred in both of these rulings. First, he \nmisapprehended Freeman and its test for unitary status. At the outset, \nFreeman explicitly rejects, as a matter of law. the very analysis \nadopted by the district court. That is, under Freeman, a district court \nmust consider· (1) compliance with prior orders (i.e., \"what CMS has \ndone\"), and (2) .whether vestiges have been eliminated to the extent \npracticable (Le., -\"\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"). See Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 491; see also Order of April 14, 1999 at 4. By construing \nFreeman's unitary status test to include the former (\"what CMS has \ndone\") but not the latter (\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"), Judge \nPotter erred as a matter of law. \n6 Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan \"after \nthe deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had \nexpired.\" On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the fed \neral rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to discovery \nrequests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore, \na more precipitant proposal could not have incorporated the various \nexpert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submit \nted earlier in the course of the litigation necessarily would have been \nbased largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have \nbeen far less useful and pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in \nadvance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five \nmonths before the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor \nthe parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary timing of \nthe Remedial Plan's submission. \n25 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 24 of 128\n\nThe Remedial Plan directly addresses the latter inquiry. and it does \nso in an apt. informed manner, relying on the considered opinions of \nhighly capable professionals retained to analyze the latest available \ndata. In other words, the district court's second reason for excluding \nthe Plan - relevancy - also fails to withstand scrutiny. 7 There is no \ndoubt that Judge Potter had wide discretion on this issue, but rele \nvancy is a fluid concept under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See \nFed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any ten \ndency to make the existence\" of any material fact\"more probable or \nless probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently, \nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. ~, \nUnited States v. Van Metre, 150 F.3d 339,349 (4th Cir. 1998) \n~, \n(citing Uiiited States v. Powers, 59 F.3d 1460, 1465 (4th Cir. 1995». \nHowever, we need not rely on the minimal threshold encompassed \nin the test for relevancy because this Remedial Plan would be relevant \nunder any reasonable test. The Remedial Plan identified record evi \ndence (including the deposition testimony of several experts) support \ning the Boa,rd:.s belief that vestiges of de jure segregation in CMS \nremain apparent in (1) faculty assignment and quality, (2) physical \nfacilities and the' allocation of instructional resources, (3) student \nachievement, and (4) student assignment. More importantly, the \nRemedial Plan detailed specific steps that the Board proposed to \nundertake over the course of the ensuing five years \"with a goal of \nachieving unitary status at that time. \" I.A. 11029. \n7 Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it \ninitially was the extent of the Board's compliance with the prior desegre \ngation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for \neven that purpose. The ease with which some of the proposed Plan reme \ndies could be realized,  merely distributing available funding to \n~, \naddress the stark disparity in basic resources such as instructional materi \nals and media centers, ~ lA. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board \nhad not fully implemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders. \nThe court nonetheless observed that \"while the goal of perfect compli \nance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been \npresented that school authorities were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" \nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 283. To the contrary, the Plan thoroughly \ndocumented the Board's failings and the facility with which they could \nbe rectified. The district court simply chose to ignore this highly relevant \nevidence. \n26 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 25 of 128\n\nWithout a doubt, federal courts possess the final word in deciding \nwhether a particular school system is operating within the parameters \nof the Constitution. Appreciable weight must be given, however. to \nthe views of those selected by the community to administer the sys \ntem. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (noting specialized knowledge pos \nsessed by local school officials).8 In refusing to consider the Plan, the \ndistrict court erroneously failed to accord the Board' s official position \nany weight. much less the respect that it was due. \nThat the district court so completely disregarded this crucial evi \ndence is telling. Nonetheless, we have carefully examined each con \nclusion below. ever mindful of the deference accorded the factfinder. \nThe manifest importance of this case (quite apart from the substantial \ntime and energy invested by the parties and the court below) demands \nthat we carefully explain the myriad aspects of our decision today. \nWe now embark upon that task. \n1. Student Assignment \n.. \nOf all the Green factors. the most fundamental is the degree of \nracial imbalance 10 student assignment. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474. \nUniformity in the racial composition of a given school was the hall \nmark of official discrimination, \"for under the former de jure regimes \nracial exclusion was both the means and the end of a policy motivated \nby disparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race.\" ~ \nCourt-ordered desegregation was designed to meet the enemy head \non; the long-term stability of attempts at racial balancing in student \nassignment is often seen as the most conspicuous indication of the \ncourts' success (or lack thereot) in combating the underlying societal \nevil. \n8 Though we need not grant CMS the same deference afforded the pro \nmulgations and adjudications of a federal administrative agency  the for \nI \nmal declarations of its governing Board \"do constitute a body of \nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \nproperly resort for guidance.\" Ritter v. Cecil County Office of Housing \n& Community Dev .• 33 F.3d 323,328 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting Skidmore \nv. Swift & Co .• 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944». \n27 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 26 of 128\n\nWe must now determine whether present racial isolation in CMS \nmay be a vestige of the former dual system, and, if so, whether there \nare practicable measures eMS could take to reduce or eliminate that \nisolation. In doing so, we are bound to focus particularly on the \nBoard's record of compliance with the district court's desegregation \norders. See id. at 492 (citing Dowell). Because Significant and grow \ning racial imbalances in student assignment do exist in eMS, because \nthe Board for decades has failed to comply with certain specific \ndecrees of the district court (particularly regarding the siting of new \nschools), because these failures may have contributed to current racial \nisolation, and because future compliance might practicably reduce \nthis racial isolation, we must vacate the district court's finding that \neMS has achieved unitary status with respect to student assignment. \na. \nIn the wake of the 1970 desegregation order, virtually all of the \nschools in CMS operated in racial balance for a considerable time. By \n1998-99 hQwever, nearly thirty percent of the schools in the system \nhad become rac~ly identifiable.9 Of the 126 schools included in the \nCMS desegregation plan, twenty-three are identifiably black and thir \nteen more are identifiably white. J.A. 11587. Further, virtually all of \nthe identifiably black schools are located in either the inner city or in \nthe immediate northwest-ta-northeast suburbs, the areas of Mecklen \nburg County with the highest concentration of African-Americans. In \nstark contrast, all thirteen of the identifiably white schools are found \nin the extreme northern and southern areas of the county, both of \nwhich (and particularly the latter) have seen dramatic increases in \nwhite population during the past thirty years. The trend in CMS \ntoward resegregation of its schools has accelerated markedly since the \nmove to de-emphasize satellite zones and mandatory busing in 1992. \nIn the last seven years, the number of CMS African-American stu-\n9 Judge McMillan's final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that \nno school should become \"racially identifiable. \" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at \n268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with \"racially \nimbalanced, \" which, as noted within, describes a school with an African \nAmerican student population deviating more than fifteen points in either \ndirection from the county-wide norm. See Caooachione, 57 F. Supp. 2d \nat 246. \n28 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 27 of 128\n\ndents who attend racially identifiable schools (now almost three in \nten) has risen fifty percent. lA. 9589. \nIndisputably, from 1981 until 1997. the CMS school system went \nthrough significant demographic changes. For example, the total p0p \nulation of Mecklenburg County has grown from 354,656 in 1970 to \n613,310 in 1997. lA. 16247. Almost 100.000 children attend CMS, \nmaking it the twenty-third largest school system in the country. I.A. \n7107. During the period from 1970 to 1997, the black school-age p0p \nulation (ages 5 through 17) in the county has increased by approxi \nmately 10,000. I.A. 16247. Over the same period, the corresponding \nwhite school-age population has decreased by approximately 3,000, \nid., and by 1997, African-Americans comprised 34 percent of the \ncounty's school-age population, the total of which numbered approxi \nmately 108.600. Evidence before the district court revealed that, since \n1970. the growing African-American population has migrated out \nward from the inner city into formerly white suburbs. In tum, many \nwhite citizens who formerly populated the city's periphery have \nmoved eveD farther into the county's outlying reaches. Though parts \nof the county  become more integrated as the result of these \n~.e \nshifts, a dispropOrtionately large number of African-Americans still \nreside in contiguous clusters generally north and west of the down \ntown area. \nThe primary issue we must address is whether the thirty-six racially \nidentifiable schools in CMS represent a vestige of segregation -- that \nis, whether the present racial isolation is causally related to the prior \nsystem of de jure segregation. The Swann plaintiffs argue, and CMS \nagrees, that current racial isolation, like the racial isolation of the \n19608 and 19705, results both from past inequities that, to some \nextent, have persisted to this day, and from the Board's failure to \ncomply with certain specific directives in the remedial decrees in this \ncase. \nBecause CMS has not previously been adjudged to have achieved \nunitary status in student assignment, we are bound under Swann to \npresume that the current racial imbalance in the school population \nconstitutes a continuing vestige of segregation. 402 U.S. at 26. The \nCapacchione plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the present \nexistence of predominantly one-race schools in CMS \"is not the result \n29 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 28 of 128\n\nof present or past discriminatory action. \" Id.; see also Riddick, 784 \nF.2d at 535. \nOur unwillingness to affirm the conclusion that CMS is unitary \nwith respect to student assignment centers on the Board S failure to \nI \ncomply with court orders regarding selection of sites for the construc \ntion of new schools. The role of school siting in achieving sustainable \ndesegregation should not be underestimated. In fact, the importance \nof site selection has been apparent since the early stages of this case. \nAs the Supreme Court explained in 1971: \nIn the past [site selection] choices ... have been used as a \npOtent .weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated \nschool system. . . . [S]chool authorities have sometimes, \nsince Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to \nbecome racially mixed through changes in neighborhood \nresidential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by \nbuilding new schools in the areas of white suburban expan \nsioO farthest from Negro population centers in order to \nmaintain the separation of the races with a minimum depar \nture frOln'the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\" \nSuch a policy does more than simply influence the short-run \ncomposition of the student body of a new school. It may \nwell promote segregated residential patterns which, when \ncombined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the \nschool system into the mold of separation of the races .... \nIn ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school seg \nregation, the existence of a pattern of school construction \nand abandonment is thus a factor of great weight. \nSwann, 402 U.S. at 21. \nSubsequent to the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, Judge \nMcMillan specifically ordered that site selection for new schools \ncould not \"be predicated on population trends alone.\" 379 F. Supp. at \n1107. New schools were \"to be built where they can readily serve \nboth races.\" Id. In the 1979 Martin decision,lO Judge McMillan \n10 Judge Potter incorrectly declared that \"Martin was not a unitary sta \ntus hearing[.]\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250. In fact, as the accom-\n30 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 29 of 128\n\ndevoted an entire section of his opinion to demonstrating that \"con \nstruction, location and closing of school buildings continue to pro \nmote segregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1329. Judge McMillan explained \nthat \"[t]he location of schools plays a large if not determinative role \nin . . . insuring that any given assignment and feeder plan will provide \nmeaningful desegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived \nappearance of desegregation.\" Id. at 1332. \n10 the years since this decree was issued, CMS has built twenty \nfive of twenty-seven new schools in predominantly white suburban \ncommunities. 10 the mid-1980s, CMS adopted a formal policy of \nbuilding \"midpoint\" schools - schools located midway between \nblack and white population centers. There is little evidence, however, \nto suggest that CMS faithfully adhered to this policy. Rather, record \nevidence strongly indicates that the policy influenced the site selec \ntion for, at most, four of the twenty-seven new schools. See I.A. \n1S404-06. Meanwhile, as we discuss infra, there is substantial evi \ndence that CMS has allowed many of its older school facilities in the \ncity -- schools'attended in disproportionate numbers by African \nAmerican stude~ - to fall into a state of disrepair. \nThe Board's record of building the great majority of its new \nschools on the predominantly white suburban fringe of the county \nsupports two possible conclusions. On one hand, CMS could have \nbeen responding to demographic reality - a demand for new class \nrooms in areas of high population growth (although we note that the \nnumber of white students in CMS has decreased since 1970, while the \nblack student population has greatly increased,). 00 the other hand, \nthe Board's pattern of school construction could have facilitated or \neven hastened white flight to the suburbs. As the Supreme Court \nexplained in~. \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just \nas schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location \nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development \npanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the \nCapacchione plaintiffs do today, that eMS had achieved unitary status. \nIntervening African-American parents, like those herein, maintained to \nthe contrary. 10 actuality, there is little difference between today's case \nand Martin, and ludge McMillan's findings in the latter are as binding \non the parties as any others made in the course of this litigation. \n31 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 30 of 128\n\nof a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of \ninner..city neighborhoods.\" 402 U.S. at 2()\"21. The Board's school sit~ \ning policies could well evidence its lack of political will in the face \nof pressure to abandon desegregative policies - pressure from \nfami~ \nlies who \"are concerned about the racial composition of a prospective \nschool and [ who] will make residential decisions accordingly. \" Free \nmilD. 503 U.S. at 513 (Blackmun, J., concurring). \nThere is certainly no evidence that CMS has intentionally sought, \nthrough its school siting policies, to \"lock the school system into the \nmold of separation of the races\" in the way that the Supreme Court \ndescribed in Slurm. But the actual choices the Board has made with \nregard to school siting may in fact be quite similar to the \"pattern of \nschool construction and abandonment\" described by the Court, with \nthe actual effect that the Court feared of \"Jock[ing] the school system\" \ninto a condition of racial isolation. 402 U. S. at 21. We cannot con \nclude, at least in the absence of further fact-finding, that CMS, in \nchoosing sites for new schools, has pursued \"meaningful desegrega \ntion, rathe~. dum just the predictably short lived ap,gearance of deseg \nregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1332. \n~'\" J\" • \nRather, the Board's practice of siting new schools such that they \ncould not reasonably be expected to serve a racially balanced student \npopulation and Judge McMillan's determination that this practice, in \nthe past, represented the school system's failure to eliminate the ves \ntiges of segregati~n, together raise a strong inference that those ves \ntiges remain today. When this inference is viewed in combination \nwith the burden borne by the Capacchione plaintiffs to show that cur \nrent racial imbalances have .DQ causaJlink to past discrimination, we \nare compelled to conclude that a remand to the district court is \nrequired. \nAlthough we defer to a district court's findings of fact unless \nclearly erroneous, Judge Potter's error here came in his application of \nthe legal standard to the evidence regarding the Board's school siting \npolicies. Judge Potter found that (1) eMS had not discriminated on \nthe basis of race in choosing sites for new schools and that (2) CMS \nhad incorporated racial diversity as one of its factors in site selection. \nEven assuming arguendo that both findings are not clearly erroneous. \nneither is sufficient to support the legal conclusion that in siting new \n32 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 31 of 128\n\nschools CMS acted in compliance with the governing court orders and \nConstitution to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent \npracticable. \n\"To fulfill this duty, school officials are obligated not only to avoid \nany official action that bas the effect of perpetuating or reestablishing \na dual school system, but also to render decisions that further desegre \ngation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school \nsystem.\" Harris v. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 968 F.2d 1090, \n1095 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Pitts v. Freeman, 755 F.2d 1423, 1427 \n(11th Cir. 1985». Therefore, CMS had to do more than merely select \nsites for new schools on a nondiscriminatory basis. It had to do more, \ntoo, than simply give some consideration to \"diversity\" in its selection \nof sites. To the extent practicable, CMS had to site new schools \n\"where they can readily serve both races. \" 379 F. Supp. at 1107; \n~ \nalso Swann. 402 U.S. at 21; MInin. 475 F. Supp. at 1329-32. Judge \nPotter never found that CMS had met this standard, and as outlined \nwithin, the~ is substantial record evidence that CMS did not do so. \nIn accordance  Swann, the burden is on the Capacchione plain \nw!~ \ntiffs to prove that vestiges of past discrimination do not remain, or \nthat nothing can practicably be done to remedy them. We note that \nJudge McMillan, in his last published decision in this case. clearly \nevidenced his understanding both that CMS had not done all that it \ncould do in the area of school siting and that future school siting deci \nsions could practicably advance the process of desegregation. On \nremand, it is thus incumbent on the Capacchione plaintiffs to demon \nstrate that conditions in Charlotte and Mecldenburg County have \nchanged sufficiently such that school siting no longer represents a \npracticable opportunity to eliminate the vestiges of segregation. \nThe Swann plaintiffs have identified additional areas in which \nCMS has fallen short of its obligations under the court orders. For the \nlife of the desegregation orders. eMS has consistently placed the \nheaviest burden of mandatory busing on African-American students. \nCurrently. 80% of those students who ride the bus as a result of a \nmandatory assignment are African-American. J.A. 11515. Judge \nMcMillan repeatedly ordered CMS to distribute this burden more \nfairly.  475 F. Supp. at 1339-«l; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 F. \n~ \nSupp. at 1232-33. Yet, CMS bas utterly failed to do so. In addition, \n33 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 32 of 128\n\neMS has never developed an effective system for monitoring student \ntransfers to ensure that the overall effect of such transfers is not to \nincrease the racial imbalance in the system as a whole. Again, this \nrepresents a failure to comply with the explicit instructions of the dis \ntrict court. ~ 475 F. Supp. at 1337-38; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 \nF. Supp. at 1229-30. We are troubled by these failings on the part of \neMS. They provide additional support for a conclusion that, in the \nface of political pressure, eMS has not done all that it could do to \neliminate the vestiges of segregation. \nFinally. the Board has itself taken the remarkable step of admittjna \nits noncompliance with prior orders in this case. A school board's \nfrank acqUiescence in a position inuring to its detriment (in this case, \nthe potential of ongoing judicial intervention), if not treated as con \nclusive, should at least be considered with the utmost gravity. Under \nthese circumstances, we have no difficulty in determining that the dis \ntrict court's conclusion that the Board's level of compliance was \"full \nand satisfactory\" must be vacated. \nb. \nIf the vestiges of official discrimination have indeed been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable with respect to student assignment, \nthen there is little reason to prolong court supervision. In light of the \ndistrict court's failure, however, to recognize the Board's continuing \nnoncompliance with respect to student assignment -- administered as \nrecently as twenty years ago in a manner reinforcing the once-official \nnotion that African-Americans are inferior - we have no confidence \nin the court's ultimate finding that these vestiges have now disap \npeared. We are therefore obliged to vacate the portion of the judgment \nbelow relating to student assignment and remand for further proceed \nings. \nOn remand, the district court must first determine whether, since \nJudge McMillan's decision in Martin, eMS has fulfllied its constitu \ntional and court-imposed obligations with regard to site selection for \nnew schools. If eMS has failed to fulfill its obligations, the district \ncourt must then determine whether this failure contributed to the pres \nent condition of racial isolation in the school system. Finally, if eMS \ndid fail to live up to its constitutional and judicially decreed obliga-\n34 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 33 of 128\n\ntions, and if that failure did contribute to the present racial imbal \nances, then the court must determine if proper site selection is a \npracticable remedy for the lingering effects of the Board's past dis \ncriminatory practices. If not, then the district court should relinquish \ncontrol over student assignment: there is nothing further that CMS \ncan practicably do to eliminate the vestiges of the prior de jure sys \ntem. \nIf, however, proper sites can be found, then the district court should \nretain control over student assignment. The court might decide, for \nexample, that most or all new schools constructed over the next sev \neral years be located proximate to the inner city or in midpoint areas \nalready integrated residentially. Conversely, the district court may \nconclude that more flexibility is required because of real estate costs, \ncrushing demand in the suburban fringes, or for some other sufficient \nreason. The court should also consider the efficacy of the Board's \nRemedial Plan as a limited term remedy for the racial isolation that \nwould otherwise continue to exist until the Board's newly redirected \nschool sitiBg ·Policies can begin to take effect.ll \nOf course, some-reasons will not be sufficient to deny African \nAmerican students a remedy, should corrective action be deemed jus \ntified. For example, political pressure and perceived resistance to \nchange by certain groups in the community will not suffice. Addition \nally, logistical barriers merely making \"difficult\" the transport inward \nof outlying white students will likewise, if reasonably surmountable, \nnot be enough. Cf. Capacchione, 57 F.

Judge Potter's mention of \"previous flDdings\" refers \nto excerpts from various opinions and orders authored by Judge \nMcMillan: \nApril 1969  \"No racial discrimination or inequality is \nn \nfound in the . . . . quality of the school buildings and equip \nment.-. . .

The court nevertheless relied on the above 1969 and 1971 find \nings to release the C@P3CChione plaintiffs from their burden of prov \ning CMS unitary with respect to facilities, stating that to proceed \notherwise would \"defy logic.\" Id. at 263. Judge Potter thus accepted \nthe premise that Judge McMillan's 1969 and 1971 findings .. consti \ntute collateral estoppel and law of the case  regarding facilities, \nIt \n\"thereby shifting the burden to CMS and the ~ plaintiffs to show \ndiscriminatory intent.\" Id. at 262. \nWe hold the district court's burden-shifting analysis to constitute \nan error of law. Once the existence of an unlawful dual school system \nhas been established and court supervision begun. it is presumed that \nracial disparities arising during the period of intervention \"are caus-\nally related to prior segregation.\" School &I. of the City of Richmond \nv. Daliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). Following the imposi \ntion of judicial control, a party seeking to end the status quo bears the \nburden of ove~g the presumption of causation.

Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537 (concluding that Swann and \nits progeny require proof of \"discriminatory intent on the part of the \nschool board of a unitary school system\" in order to resume court super \nvision). 12 \nTo be sure, the absence heretofore of any finding to the contrary \nwould have been an important consideration in determining whether \nthe Capacchione plaintiffs had proved eMS to have achieved unitary \nstatus with respect to facilities. However, that Judge McMillan did not \nintend his initial observations regarding facilities to be construed as \na finding of unitary status is obvious from his subsequent actions. In \n12 However, if a district court retains jurisdiction over one or more \nfactors, it may, upon a proper showing, reassert control over a fac \n~ \ntor previously adjudged to have attained unitary status.

Judge McMillan assumed control over facilities and resources, \nfound inequities, and ordered CMS to remedy those disparities. ~ \nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1235 (finding Double Oaks Elementary access \nroad still undeveloped two years after court's identification of the \nproblem - \"No $80,000,000 budget is so powerless. H); id. (finding \nDouble Oaks library not restored to standards several years after fire); \nid. at 1238 (ordering athletic facilities at West Charlotte High School \nimmediately upgraded to level comparable with other schools in the \ncounty). We must conclude that the Board has been subject to the \ncourt's jurisdiction as to its facilities since at least 1973. See Dowell, \n498 U.S. at 246 (school boards entitled to a \"rather precise statement\" \ntermina~g a desegregation order). \nThe asserted lack of a prior adverse finding should not have been \ndeterminative of the issue, especially as the district court in 1969 was \nnot focusing on a school system suddenly thrust into the judicial \narena, but was instead examining one that had been subject to court \nsupervision for nearly four years. Between the commencement of the \ninitial  in 1965 and the district court's first mention of \n~.lawsuit \nthe facilities issue in April 1969, CMS closed sixteen black schools. \nThe Board's en masse action gives rise to an almost undeniable infer \nence that these schools were shut down because they were inferior \nt \nand the timing also suggests strongly that the closures were prompted \nby the judicial proceedings then underway. \nViewed in context, the most plausible conclusion is that the puta-\ntive equality mentioned by the district court in 1969 and 1971 was \nactually an endorsement of the steps that had been taken by the Board \nto remedy the inequities in facilities. In any event, CMS could not be \nsaid to have achieved unitary status absent a finding by the lower \ncourt that the Board had \"eliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimi \nnation,\" embodied in an \"adjudicat[ion] ... through the proper judi \ncial procedures.\" Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. \nGeorgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1413 n.12 (lIth Cir. 1985), Quoted in \nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (noting distinction between school systems \noperating in an unitary fashion and those that have achieved unitary \nstatus, and observing that the former \"could be called unitary and nev \nertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination\"). \n38 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 37 of 128\n\nThirty-five years have passed since the Board first acted to equalize \nits facilities, yet serious questions remain as to whether it has finally \nrealized that goal. Dr. Dwayne E. Gardner, an impressively qualified \neducational planner and consultant, compiled an exhaustive report for \nthe Board in which he evaluated the suitability of its school facilities.13 \nDr. Gardner examined and personally visited more than half of the \nschools in CMS (including all of the high schools), analyzing a host \nof factors affecting educational quality. For the purposes of his study, \nDr. Gardner divided the subject schools into three groups: (1) all \nimbala~-black schools; (2) all racially balanced schools in \nimbala~-bJack census tracts; and (3) each remaining high school, \nalong with a set of elementary and middle schools randomly selected \nfrom the remaining schools and approximately equal in number to \nthose already included within the first two groups. \nEach school in the study was assigned a composite score from 0-\n100, indicating its worthiness. Schools scoring 44 or lower were, in \nDr. Gardner's opinion, so deficient as to merit replacement, while \nthose with .sceres between 45-59 were classified as needing \"major \nimprovements. \": Any school that scored 60 or above was \"considered \nto have the abilitY\" to serve the educational program adequately.  lA. \nn \n12174. \nThe results of Dr. Gardner's study are troubling. The average score \nfor the forty Group 3 schools (racially balanced or imbalanced-white \nin predominantly white or balanced areas) was 61.7. Although the \nGroup 3 data indicate a situation that is far from ideal, the ten Group \n2 schools (racially balanced in predominantly black areas) fared much \nworse, with an average score of 56.3. The scores of the twenty-three \nGroup 1 schools (imbalanced-blaCk) were worse still, averaging just \n53.3.14 At trial, Dr. Gardner confinned that the disparities apparent \n13 The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the Capac \nchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J. Armor. could offer no reliable testimony \non the subject. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 264. \n14 It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benja \nmin Disraeli, depending on one's source), \"There are three kinds of ties \n--lies, damned lies and statistics.\" A common difficulty in dealing with \nstatistics is illustrated by the district court's analysis of Dr. Gardner's \n39 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 38 of 128\n\nfrom the above numbers were \"substantial\" with respect to the facili \nties generally available to white and African-American children \nattending CMS. J.A. 6196-99. \nThe anecdotal accounts of a number of witnesses effectively cor \nroborated Dr. Gardner's conclusions. See, U:., J.A. 4992 (testimony \nof Board member Pamela R. Mange) (schools with \"more severe\" \nproblems tended to be predominantly black); J .A. 4769 (testimony of \nAnnelle Houk) (\"[T]he schools that were in the·worst repair and had \nthe poorest supply of resources . . . were on the west side and they \nwere predominantly populated by black students. H). John A. Kramer, \nco-chair of an advisory task force created by the Board, made formal \nvisits to several CMS schools in 1997. Among the locales on Mr. \nstudy. The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest \ncategory, two were in Group 1 and two were in Group 3. Capacchione, \n57 F. Supp. 2d at 264-65. Next, the court observed that the two highest \nratings accorded elementary schools were again split between Groups 1 \nand 3. Id. at 265. Based on this selective culling of the data, the lower \nt6at \ncourt co~luded  \"the results of Dr. Gardner's analysis do not show \ndisparities along racial lines. \" Id. at 264. \nThe forest that is CMS is not sufficiently mapped by the documenta-\ntion of a few trees. We could accurately say, for example, that omission \nfrom Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the dis \ntrict court as having one of the highest ratings would lower the Group 1 \naverage by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that \nseven of the twenty-three Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored \nbelow 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent) \nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that  of the Group 1 high schools \n~ \nscored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 scored at 50 or \nabove. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with \nsome skepticism once it became known that there are but fourteen high \nschools in eMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in \nGroup 1. \nThe pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gard \nner's research lies in the general conclusions that can be drawn from the \nentirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general \nmatter, imbalanced-black schools in eMS are in worse shape than those \nattended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that \npremise, the lone remaining question of any significance is \"Why?\" \n40 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 39 of 128\n\nKramer's itinerary were Elizabeth Lane Elementary, a predominantly \nwhite school located in a prosperous suburban area of the county, and \nShamrock Gardens Elementary, a downtown school with an African \nAmerican student population exceeding sixty percent. Mr. Kramer's \ndescriptions of his visits contrasted sharply: \n[TJo compare Elizabeth Lane Elementary as an example, \nwhich is a relatively new school located in Matthews, I \nwalked into that school, I was overwhelmed because I had \nnever set foot in a school that was like that before. It was \nclean, it was light and airy, it was a beautiful facility. . . . \nMy overwhelming feeling was, wow, I wish my kids could \ngo to this school. And another observation that was very \nclear was that when I looked at the student body, it was vir \ntually all white students, obviously. affluent, happy kids \nhaving a great time. \nOn the other hand, my experience, for example, at Sham \nr~k -Gardens was shocking by comparison. I had never vis \nited ei~t:r. one of these schools before, but to visit that \nschool which is in the inner city, the students are predomi \nnantly black students, it reminded me of a rundown 1950s \nmotel. There was literally no access to the rooms except by \nouter walkways that were covered by rusted, dilapidated \noverhead fixtures. . . . They were using closets and things \nto teach children in. The carpets were stained and thread \nbare .... It just didn't feel clean, it didn't feel good. And \nI can honestly say that as a parent, my heartfelt reaction was \nrelief that my children didn't have to go to school there. \nI.A. 6098-99. Even those Board members who voted to pursue a \ndetermination of unitary status before the district court admitted that \ndisparity in facilities was a problem within CMS. lA. 1817, 1820 \n(testimony of lames H. Puckett); I.A. 1918-19 (testimony of Iohn W. \nLassiter); I.A. 2095-96 (testimony of Lindalyn Kakadelis). \nAlthough it seems reasonably clear that a racial disparity in facili-\nties exists in CMS, its cause is somewhat less apparent. The Capacch \nione plaintiffs maintain that no discrepancies exist in CMS facilities, \nand even if they do, such discrepancies are totally benign in origin. \n41 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 40 of 128\n\nHad the Caoacchione plaintiffs proved their theory, we would be con \nstrained to affinn the district court's conclusion that unitary status has \nbeen achieved with respect to the facilities factor. The district court, \nhowever, required the Capacchione plaintiffs to prove nothing; it \ninstead erroneously placed the burden on CMS and the Swann plain \ntiffs to affinnatively show that the present inequities in facilities are \na vestige of official discrimination, i.e., causally related to the prior \nde jure system of segregation. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267. \nThe district court erred as a matter of law in foreclosing the devel \nopment of evidence relevant to a proper vestige analysis. We must \ntherefore,!Cmand this portion of the case to permit the parties and the \ndistrict court to elicit the additional facts necessary to fully consider \nthe question of causation with respect to the current racial inequities \nin facilities. Because CMS has not been previously adjudged to have \nattained unitary status, the Capacchione plaintiffs are charged on \nremand with the burden of demonstrating that the vestiges of past de \njure racial discrimination in the context of the school system's facili \nties have bien eliminated \"root and branch\" to the extent practicable. IS \nIS The district court made no findings as to whether practicable reme \ndies exist with respect to facilities. In light of the court's refusal to con \nsider the Board's proposed five-year Remedial Plan, we cannot \ndetermine in the first instance whether practicable remedies to the current \ndisparities exist. We therefore remand to the district court for develop \nment on this point. We note, however, that the Remedial Plan specifi \ncally identifies disparities associated with race in baseline needs for \nschools' instructional materials and media centers, and the lack of any \nstandardized criteria to evaluate the adequacy of these resources. J.A. \n11037-38. The Plan proposes to achieve uniformity in resources across \nschools by imbalanced allocations that reflect the schools' current \nresource gaps and imbalances. lA. 11038-40. Likewise, the Remedial \nPlan identifies disparities associated with race in the instructional facili \nties, and proposes building replacements or renovating existing facilities \nfor sixteen schools that are either racially identifiable as black or are \nlocated in a predominantly black census tract. J.A. 11041-42. Uniform \nbuilding maintenance standards and procedures are proposed. J.A. \n11043. Monitoring, evaluation, and development of appropriate criteria \nfor evaluation are also proposed to maintain equity across the school sys \ntem's resources and facilities.

Transportation \nSchool bus transportation was at the epicenter of the original \n~ litigation, specifically the degree to which involuntary busing \ncould be used to implement a remedial desegregation decree. The \nSupreme Court in Swann, of course, approved busing as a \"nonna! \nand accepted tool of educational policy,\" 402 U.S. at 29, at least to \nthe extent that the rigors of time and distance would pose little risk \nto the affected students' health or to the educational process as a \nwhole. See id. at 30-31. In the intervening twenty-nine years, CMS \nhas taken the Court's license to heart; during the 1998-99 school year, \nfive of every six students in the school system rode a school bus. \nUpon review of the ~ factor of transportation. Judge Potter \nconcluded that \"a court may grant unitary status when transportation \nis provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\" 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267. In \nother words, according to the district court. a school system achieves \nunitary status with respect to transportation once it provides access to \ntransportation non-discriminatorily to black and white children. \nBecause CMS ~.pvides all children, regardless of race. access to \ntransportation, judge Potter concluded that CMS had achieved unitary \nstatus with respect to this Green factor. \nWe must be mindful of the Supreme Court's command to consider \nthe interrelatedness of the various ~ factors. See Freeman. 503 \nU.S. at 491 (court must consider \"whether retention of judicial control \nis necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in \nother facets of the school system\"). In this context, we can only con \nclude that the Green factor of transportation is so inextricably inter \ntwined with the Green factors of student assignment and facilities that \nour vacatur on those issues also mandates vacatur on the factor of trans \nportation.16 \n16 Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the \nBoard and the ~ plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of official \ndiscrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student \nachievement and student discipline. The court found in the negative, con \ncluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas. \nWith respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, we must \nvacate Judge Potter's holding that unitary status had been achieved, and \n43 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 42 of 128\n\nThe ~ plaintiffs maintain and offer substantial record evidence \nthat the burdens of busing for desegregation purposes are being borne \ndisproportionately and unfairly by AfricanMAmerican children. Brief \nof Appellants at 31M32, 33-35; see Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298 (dis \ntrict court commenting in initial stages of remediation that it did not \nintend \"to endorse or approve any future plan which puts the burden \nof desegregation primarily upon one race\"). Eighty percent of stu \ndents who currently ride the bus as a result of a mandatory assignment \nare African-American. Judge Potter rejected any consideration of this \nevidence, holding that a school district has achieved unitary status \nwith respect to transportation as soon as it is provided on a race \nneutral basis. The evidence, however, demonstrates the close interre \nlationship of transportation with student assignment. In view of our \nconclusion that CMS is not yet unitary with regard to student assign \nment, we think it is premature to relinquish control over transporta \ntion at this stage. On remand, if the district court determines that CMS \nmust remain under court order to correct the current imbalances in \nstudent assignment, it should also retain control over transportation to \nensure that:tiwse imbalances are corrected in a way that is fair to all \nstudents. 17 \n:: \nwe do so on a basis similar to our analysis of the Green factor of trans \nportation. Judge Potter found that disparities in student achievement \nexisted but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segrega \ntion and (2) could not be remedied by any practicable measure. Capacch \n~, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 280-81. An analysis of disparities in student \nachievement may only be appropriate once the school system has \nachieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F. Supp. at \n1309 (\"Until unlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate \nwhether some of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial differ \nences or to 'socio-economic-cultural  lag.\"). At the very least, as with \nt \ntransportation, student achievement in this case is inextricably inter \ntwined with the other  factors, particularly student assignment. \n~ \nTherefore, having vacated certain of the district court's rulings on unitary \nstatus, including its ruling with respect to student assignment, we must \nalso vacate the district court's conclusion on student achievement. \nWe have reviewed and considered the district court's consideration of \nstudent discipline. and we affirm the district court's resolution as to this \nancillary factor. \n17 While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation \nas a ~ factor, it does propose siting new schools in a manner calcu-\n44 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 43 of 128\n\n4. Faculty \nOur analysis of this factor must take two concerns into account. We \nmust determine both whether eMS has generally eliminated the ves \ntiges of discrimination in faculty assignment, and whether the teach \ners assigned to predominantly black schools are of comparable quality \nto those teaching in schools with large numbers of white students. IS \nSee Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (final desegregation order directing \nthat the racial composition of faculty assigned to each school reflect \nthat of the system at large, with the proviso that \"the competence and \nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently black schools will not \nbe inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the \nsystem\"). \nThe evidence at trial demonstrated that eMS assigned its faculty \nin substantial compliance with the desegregation order at least until \n1992, when school principals were granted the leeway to actively \nrecruit new teachers without the strictures of maintaining a specific \nracial propbmon. As a result of this gravitation from centralized to \nsite-based  of faculty assignments, a trend away from propor \ncontr~l \ntionality has emerged. In 1998-99, one-third of the 126 schools cov \nered by the remedial decree had a proportion of black faculty \ndeviating more than ten percent from the system-wide norm (about \nlated to promote racial balance in eMS. J.A. 11042. If eMS chooses \nsites for new schools that are more accessible to the majority of the black \npopulation, we presume that fewer black students would have to be \nbused to the suburbs for purposes of desegretation. A new approach to \nschool siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such \nvestiges remain, in those areas in which eMS has not yet achieved uni \ntary status. \n18 The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbal \nanced if its proportion of African-American students varied more than \nfifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998-99, African \nAmericans represented 42.7% of the elementary students in eMS, 41.7% \nof the middle school students. and 39.6% of the high school students. \nJ.A. 11574. An elementary school would therefore be designated \nimbalanced-black if more than 57.7 % of its students are African \nAmerican; conversely. if African-Americans constituted less than 27.7 % \nof the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white. \n45 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 44 of 128\n\ntwenty-one percent). Prior to the 1992 change in policy, no more than \none sixth of the schools had ever been so situated. \n6\nWe are satisfied that the current trend toward faculty imbalance is \nneither a vestige of the dual system nor the product of subsequent dis \ncrimination. There is no evidence that this trend results from legal or \nadministrative compulsion within CMS or from perceptions about the \ndesirability or undesirability of teaching positions in schools that \nserve students of predominantly one race. In short, we do not perceive \na causal relationship between past de jure segregation and the present \nassignment of faculty members to schools within CMS.19 \nNor do we'think: that this trend toward more racially imbalanced \nfaculties has resulted in disparities in the quality of teaching, as mea \nsured by the instructors' years of experience and post-graduate work. \nIndeed, there is no significant difference in experience between facul \nties at imbalanced-black schools as compared to those that are \nimbalanced-white. Faculties at black schools are about one year less \nexperienced than the district wide average, while faculties at white \n6\nschools are correspondingly more seasoned. This disparity may \narouse some initlil· concerns, until one is informed that the typical \nCMS teacher has spent more than ten years in the classroom. The \nupshot is that black and white students alike are, with no meaningful \ndistinction, enjoying the benefits of their teachers  substantial experi\nI  6 \nence. \nThe difference in post-graduate education between black-school \nand white-school faculties is more pronounced. For every three teach-\n19 Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to \nbe a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before the dis \ntrict court casts substantial doubt upon the Board s ability to effect a \nI \npracticable remedy. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 258-59: \nCMS runs the risk of losing significant numbers of teachers if its \nfaculty assignment policies become too restrictive .... Another \npractical problem faced by the district is the fact that it must con \nstantly hire thousands of new teachers in the midst of a national \nteacher shortage ... [which] is especially pronounced with \nregard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the coun \ntry. \n46 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 45 of 128\n\ners holding advanced degrees who ply their craft at imbalanced-white \nschools, there are only two similarly qualified teachers assigned to \nschools that are imbalanced-black. Compared to the district average, \nwhite schools have a somewhat larger proportion of these highly \ntrained instructors, while the allotment granted to black schools is \nslightly less than the nonn. \nAlthough these facts give us reason for concern, we think it impru- . \ndent to disturb the district court's conclusion that the trial evidence \naffirmatively disclosed no link between past discrimination and the \ncurrent asymmetry. Most revealing on this point is that, until now, the \nissue of teacher quality within CMS has not been contested. The 1970 \ndesegregation order mandating equal competence and experience in \nfaculty assignments was not meant to remedy disparities then exist \ning, but was instead intended to caution against future imbalances. In \nthe intervening thirty years, there is little indication that CMS has \nneglected to heed the warning inherent in that order. \nThe district' cOurt did not clearly err in concluding that the develop \ning disparities ~~~her assignments and any (perhaps superficial) \ndeficiency in the quality of instruction currently afforded African \nAmerican children are unrelated to the de jure segregation once prev \nalent in the school system. We therefore affirm the lower court's find \ning that CMS has attained unitary status with respect to faculty.20 \n5. Staff \nIn substantially the same manner as it spoke to the allocation of \nteachers, the final desegregation order provided that \"the internal \noperation of each school, and the assignment and management of \nschool employees, of course be conducted on a non-racial, non \ndiscriminatory basis.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269. Inasmuch as the \nSwann plaintiffs raised no challenge to the school system's compli \nance with the desegregation order in this regard, the court below \n20 Although the Board's official position, as outlined in its Remedial \nPlan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do remain as to \nfaculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the \ncontrary. The district court's failure to consider the Plan was therefore \nharmless in this narrow respect. \n47 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 46 of 128\n\nfound eMS to have achieved unitary status with regard to its support \nstaff. We agree, and we affirm that aspect of the district court's judg \nment. \n6. Extracurricular activities \nAccording to the evidence at trial, African-American students in \nCMS participate in athletics and hold class office at a rate proportion \nate to their numbers. These same students lag far behind, however, \nwhen it comes to participating in co-curricular clubs and honors pro \ngrams. I.A. 11634. However, the scope of our inquiry concerning \nextracurricular activities is limited. We need only determine whether \nthe school system permits its students equal access to extracurricular \nactivities, without regard to race. Coalition to Save Our Children v. \nState Bd. of Educ. of Delaware, 90 F.3d 752, 768-69 (3d Cir. 1996) \n(citation omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 18-19 (\"[T]he (ust \nremedial responsibility of school authorities is to eliminate invidious \nracial distinctions. With respect to such matters as transportation, sup \nporting persoDDel, and extracurricular activities, no more than this \nmay be necessary. . . . In these areas, normal administrative practice \nshould produce sChools of like quality, facilities, and staffs. H). \nThe criterion of equal access is surely satisfied in this regard. Par \nticipation in honors programs and co-curricular clubs is strictly volun \ntary, and there is no evidence that the lack of participation by African \nAmerican students in certain activities reflects the efforts of CMS to \nexclude them. We discern no error in the district court's conclusions \nregarding this ~ factor, and we therefore affirm its finding that \nCMS has achieved unitary status with respect to extracurricular activ \nities. \nc. \nPursuant to the foregoing, we conclude that the district court \nshould be affirmed in its determination of unitary status with respect \nto faculty, staff, extracurricular activities, and student discipline. \nHowever, we also conclude that we must vacate and remand for fur \nther consideration in the areas of student assignment, facilities, trans \nportation, and student achievement. \n48 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 47 of 128\n\nVolume 2 of3 \n49 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 48 of 128\n\nm. \nWe now turn to the question of whether the Board's expanded \nmagnet schools program violates the Constitution. \nEven if we had concluded that the district court was correct in \ndecreeing that CMS has rullY achieved unitary status in all respects, \nany preceding remedial measures could not be analyzed as if they had \nbeen taken by a \"de facto\" unitary school district. Prior to the decision \nbelow, no court had ever determined that CMS had attained unitary \nstatus as to any  factor. As the CaDacchiooe plaintiffs concede, \n~ \nJudge Potter's decision -- not some earlier event-- \"terminated [the] \ninjunction  issued by Judge McMillan and affirmed by the Supreme \nft \nCourt. Brief of Appellees at 3. \nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that unitary status is a legal \nconcept that has no \"fixed meaning or content\" independent of the \njudicial proceeding in which \"unitariness\" is conferred. Freeman, 503 \nU.S. at 486.-81. The Court has consistently held that desegregation \ndecrees remain in effect until they are terminated by a court in unam \nsee\" \nbiguous terms.  Dowell, 498 U.S. at 244-46 (finding district \ncourt's prior determination of \"unitarioess\" too ambiguous to dissolve \ndesegregation decree and emphasizing that litigants are entitled to a \n\"rather precise statement\" if a decree is to be terminated); Spangler, \n427 U.S. at 438-40 (holding that even an unconstitutional court order \nremains in effect until a \"defmitive disposition\" is reached on the con-\n50 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 49 of 128\n\nstitutional objection). Thus, Judge Potter properly acknowledged that \nthe law would not support a judicial finding that a school district had \nattained unitary status at a point in time prior to the court's own uni \ntariness determination. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (\"The \nCourt finds no legal basis for a finding of de facto unitary status that \nwould abrogate CMS's immunity retroactively. In other words, the \ntermination of court supervision cannot 'relate back' to an earlier \ntime. \"). \nJudge Potter nevertheless held that the expanded magnet schools \nprogram was \"ultra vires, \" beyond the scope of action authorized \nunder the series of injunctions and orders governing desegregation of \nCMS. Id. After holding that the magnet schools program exceeded the \nscope of these injunctions and orders, the district court proceeded to \nanalyze whether the program violated the Capacchione plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights. Applying strict scrutiny, the court concluded that \nthe expanded magnet schools program could not be legally justified. \nId. at 287-90. \nWe review the ~strict court's factual findings for clear error and \nits legal conclusions de novo. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474; United \nStates v. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 306 n.8 (5th Cir. 1998); Little Rock \nSch. Dist. v. North Little Rock Sch. Dist., 109 F.3d 514,516 (8th Cir. \n1997). \nFor the reasons that follow, we must reverse. In fact, the injunc \ntions and orders governing this case specifically authorize every sig \nnificant aspect of the expanded magnet schools program, including \nthe use of racial proportions in assigning students to magnet schools. \nFurthermore, the Board's obligation to obey these court orders insu \nlates it from constitutional attack for actions taken in compliance with \nthem. \nA. \nMagnet schools are designed to achieve desegregation by offering \nsome kind of special program or curriculum that will attract students, \nregardless of race, from throughout a school district. See Missouri y. \nJenkins, 495 U.S. 33,40 n.6 (1990); see also 20 U.S.C. § 7204 (1999) \n(a magnet school is \"a public elementary or secondary school ... that \n51 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 50 of 128\n\noffers a special curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers \nof students of different racial backgrounds\"). Magnets \"were first con \nceived and developed in large, urban school districts seeking a volun \ntary alternative to busing as a means of decreasing racial segregation. \" \nJ.A. 106.54. Critical to the magnet school concept is voluntary choice \n-- students choose to attend magnet schools because of their desire \nfor the special programs such schools offer. Thus, magnet schools, \nwhen not permitted to become dominated by one race, act as \"incen \ntives for parents to keep their children in the public school system and \nto send their children to integrated schools.\" I.A. 15509. \nSince the 1970s, school boards throughout the country have uti-\nlized magnet schools as part of desegregation plans that have been \nroutinely approved by the courts. See. e.g., Milliken v. Bradlev. 433 \nU.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken ill; Stell v. Savannah-Cbatham \nCounty Bd. of Educ., 888 F.2d 82,85-86 (11th Cir. 1989); Little Rock \nSch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No.1, 839 F.2d 1296, \n1309-12 (8th Cir. 1988); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837 \nF.2d 1181,  (2d Cir. 1987); Liddell v. Missouri, 731 F.2d \n.~237-39 \n1294, 131()\"11 (8th Cir. 1984). \nAlmost invariably, magnet school programs include an assignment \npolicy that takes race into account \"to assure to the greatest extent \npossible that these voluntary attendance schools not work to under-\nmine the progress of desegregation. \" Davis v. East Baton Rouge Par \nish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425, 1440 (Sth Cir. 1983). Such a policy is \nnecessary to prevent magnet schools from \"serv[ing] as a haven for \nthose seeking to attend a school predominantly composed of their \nown race\". Morgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401.423 (lst Cir. 1976); \nsee also Jenkins v. Missouri, 942 F.2d 487,488-89 (8th Cir. 1991); \nStell, 888 F.2d at 83; Little Rock Sch. Dist., 839 F.2d at 1311; Yonkers \nBd. of Educ., 837 F.2d at 1215; Liddell, 731 F.2d at 1310. \nThe various court decisions reflect a cautious enthusiasm for the \nutilization of magnet schools, both because such schools allow for \nmore flexibility in student assignment and because they rely more \nheavily on voluntary choice than mandatory busing. See. e.g., Jenkins, \nSIS U.S. at 92 {\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging \nvoluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern \nthat aids desegregation on a voluntary basis, without requiring exten-\n52 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 51 of 128\n\nsive busing and redrawing of district boundary lines. \").21 Further, no \nauthority suggests that magnet programs with race-conscious assign \nment policies constitute an inappropriate vehicle for achieving deseg \nregation under a court-sponsored plan. Indeed, it is difficult to see \nhow a magnet program devised, with court approval, to eliminate ves \ntiges of segregated schools could do so if school authorities were not \npermitted to control the racial composition of magnet school enroll \nment. \nBy the 19705, CMS had established some magnet schools, which \nit called lIoptional schools.\" These early magnet schools had race \nconscious assignment policies. ~ 379 F. Supp. at 1106, 1108; J.A. \n2489. Moreover, they offered two special curricula -- \"open\" and \n\"traditional  both of which constituted \"very rigorous academic \nII -\nprogram[s)1I not offered in \"conventional schools.\" J.A. 2489, 15683. \nJudge McMillan approved these magnet schools, including their race \nconscious assignment policies. ~ 379 F. Supp. at 1105-106. \nIn 1992, tAe·Board expanded its magnet schools program into a \ndistrict-wide system with a wider range of curricular choices. In the \nexpanded magnet 'schools program, the Board retained the curricula \nfirst available in the early magnet or  optional\" schools -- the \"open\" \nII \ncurriculum, emphasizing \"interdisciplinary approaches,\" and the \"tra \nditional\" curriculum, featuring a \"highly structured program.\" J. A. \n16722-23. Furthermore, six of the early magnets that offered such \ncurricula prior to 1992 -- Myers Park, Elizabeth, Hawthorne, Irwin \nAvenue, Piedmont, and West Charlotte - continue to do so today \nunder the expanded magnet schools program. Compare I.A. 13448, \n1352940, 15683 (pre-l992 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets) with \nI.A. 16722-23 (1998-99 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets); see also \nlA. 10061 (report indicating that pre-l992 magnet schools were \nincorporated into the 1992 expanded magnet schools program).22 \n21 The courts' caution essentially anticipates the position of the ~ \nplaintiffs in this case: that magnet schools are insufficiently desegrega \ntive at best, and that at worst they simply provide an \"escape hatch\" for \nwhite students who would otherwise attend majority black schools, leav \ning those majority black schools even more segregated than they had \nbeen before. \n22 ludge Potter r~gnized that the optional schools \"were similar to \ntoday's magnet schools,\" both having countywide enrollment and a racial \n53 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 52 of 128\n\nRace is considered in assigning students to the magnet schools \ninstituted under the 1992 expanded program, just as it was in assign \ning students to the original magnet or optional schools. ~ 379 F. \nSupp. at 1108. Specifically, under the expanded program, CMS allo \ncates 40% of the seats in its magnet schools for black students and \n60% for students of other races. This ratio reflects the student popula \ntion of the school system, which is approximately 41.0 % black, \n52.2% white, 3.7% Asian, 2.5% Hispanic, and .5% American Indian.23 \nCMS generally assigns students to its magnet schools using two paral-\nlei lotteries, one for black students and one for students of other races. \nWhen there has been insufficient interest from black students to fill \nthe seats allocated to them in a particular school, CMS has sometimes \n'. \nbalancing target.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d. at 286. He nonetheless \nconcluded that the schools established after 1992 under the expanded \nmagnet schools program \"differ from optional schools in that [the new] \nmagnets offer specialized curricula and thereby confer a benefit above \nand beyon~~ regular academic program.\" Id. at 286-87 n. 49. But \nnothing in the record supports this view. To the contrary, assuming \narguendo that \"specialized curricula\" constitute a \"benefit,\" the magnet \nschools instituted after 1992 provide precisely the same \"benefit\" as the \npre-l992 \"optional schools.\" See J.A. 10552 (proposed 1992 pupil \nassignment plan recommending continuation of six magnet schools \nalready in place); lA. 15504 (1993 letter noting that magnet schools \nwere called \"optional schools\" prior to 1992); I.A. 10651 (Summary of \nFindings From Research on Magnet Schools explaining that \"[o]ur \noptional schools function as magnet schools\"); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee \nPlan explaining that \"[the traditional schools presently existing in \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg are good examples\" of curriculum specialty \nschools, \"sometimes called magnet schools\"). After all, it was only \nbecause the optional schools did offer certain \"specialized curricula\" that \nparents (including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, lA. \n2489) were willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet schools pro \ngram, to enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J .A. \n13641, 15616. In fact, the original six \"open\" and \"traditional\" schools \nremain among CMS's more heavily subscribed magnets. See lA. 10292-\n340. Myers Park Traditional, for example, had 245 students on its wait \ning list for the 1998-99 school year. See lA. 2159. \n23 For simplicity. we often refer within to non-African-American stu \ndents in the magnet schools as \"white.\" \n54 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 53 of 128\n\nrefused to allow students of other races to fill those slots. Thus, race \nmay affect a student's chances of being assigned to a magnet school. \nB. \nThe Capacchione plaintiffs contend that the expanded magnet \nschools program violates the Equal Protection Clause. Recognizing, \nif only implicitly, the difficulty in maintaining that actions taken pur \nsuant to court orders violate the Constitution, they principally argue \nthat the expanded magnet program was not implemented under the \ncourt orders governing this case. Specitically. they tirst contend that \nthe Board's increased reliance on magnet schools constituted a \"vol \nuntary desegregation plan implemented to counteract demographic \nchange,\" rather than a good faith effort to eliminate the vestiges of \ndiscrimination as required by the existing desegregation orders. Sec \nond, they argue that the expanded program's race-conscious assign \nment lottery violated the desegregation orders. Finally, they maintain \nthat even if CMS expanded its magnet schools program pursuant to \nand in compliance with governing court orders, strict scrutiny none \ntheless applies 8;Ild requires that the program be held unconstitutional. \nWe consider each 'contention in tum. \n1. \nThe Capacchione plaintiffs note that implementation of the \nexpanded magnet schools program followed on the heels of demo \ngraphic changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. As discussed in \nconnection with student assignment, supra, the Charlotte \nMecklenburg area has experienced in recent decades both strong pop \nulation growth overall and intensive out-migration from the city to the \nsuburbs and from older, inner-ring suburbs to newer suburbs in the far \nnorthern and southern areas of the county. For these reasons, the \nCapacchione plaintiffs insist that the expanded magnet program was \nnecessarily a response to demographic change rather than a true \nattempt to remedy past discrimination. \nWe cannot agree. First, Judge Potter \"accept[ed] that the school \nsystem was acting to . . . remedy[] the effects of past racial discrimi \nnation\" in expanding the number of magnet schools in 1992. Capac \nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. Ample record evidence supports this \n55 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 54 of 128\n\nfinding. See. e.g., 1.A. 2716 (testimony of lohn Murphy, former CMS \nSuperintendent, that 1992 plan to expand the magnet school program \nwas among the \"creative strategies we could come up with to stay in \ncompliance with the court order\"); 1.A. 3869-74 (testimony of Jeff \nSchiller, former assistant superintendent for research, assessment, and \nplanning for CMS, explaining that the 1992 student assignment plan, \nincluding the expanded magnet schools program, \"had the same \nobjectives as the one that it was going to replace, maintaining the \ncourt order, .. and that the objective of the expanded magnet program \nspecifically was \"to maintain the integration of schools through vol \nuntary means\"); 1.A. 15503-05 (1993 letter from eMS to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education discussing Judge McMillan's 1974 order \nand identifying the creation of additional magnet schools as among \nthe \"more effective ways ... [to] meet[] the guidelines established \nby the Court\"); J.A. 13607, 15582 (Stolee Plan recommendation that \n\"[the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school desegregation plan should be \ngradually changed from a mandatory plan with little voluntarism to \na voluntary plan with few mandatory facets\"). \nFurthermore, the dichotomy the Capacchione plaintiffs suggest \nbetween \"coun.:etling] demographic change,\" on the one hand, and \nremedying past discrimination, on the other, oversimplifies both the \nlaw of school desegregation, particularly the Supreme Court's deci \nsions in Green, Swann, and Freeman, and the practical reality of \nachieving desegregation in a large urban school district. From the \nearly stages of the Swann litigation, it has been understood that demo \ngraphic patterns would complicate the process of school desegrega \ntion. Indeed, remedies like school busing and satellite attendance \nzones would never have been necessary in the first place if the \ndemography of the community were not an obstacle to desegregation. \nIn a sense, Swann's basic teaching is that the Constitution sometimes \nrequires schools to \"counter demograph[y]\" in order to achieve deseg \nregation. The Swann Court noted that the process of \"local authorities \n. . . meet[ing] their constitutional obligations\" had \"been rendered \nmore difficult by changes . . . in the structure and patterns of commu \nnities, the growth of student population, [and] movement of families.\" \n402 U.S. at 14. The Court expressed concern that\"segregated residen \ntial patterns ... [would] lock the school system into the mold of sepa \nration of the races.\" Id. at 21. Thus, CMS simply followed the \n56 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 55 of 128\n\nSupreme Court's guidance in Swann in regarding demographic \nchange as a problem inhibiting its progress toward unitary status.24 \nMoreover, Freeman simply did not hold, as the Capacchione plain· \ntiffs necessarily imply, that demographic changes in a metropolitan \narea independently eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. Nor \ndoes Freeman bar courts from targeting racial isolation resulting in \nsignificant part from \"private choice,\" if that isolation is also a vestige \n24 The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern \nof school officials with demographic changes, \"CMS could not have \nbeen motivated by any desire to comply with its  duty to \ncourt~rdered \neradicate vestiges of segregation.\" Brief of Appellees at 85. But this \nstands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the ~ of their \nacts, not from their motives, whether school authorities comply with a \ndesegregation decree. See Wrieht v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, \n462 (1972) (\"It is difficult or impossible for any court to detennine the \nsole or donti.nant motivation behind choices of a group of legislators, and \nthe same may l>!' said of the choices of a school board .... Thus we have \nfocused upon the-effect - not the purpose or motivation - of a school \nboard's action in detennining whether it is a permissible method of dis \nmantling a dual system. \") (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover, \neven if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading \nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously \naware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts as an obstacle \nto achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the \nvestiges of discrimination in the school system, not as the condition that \nitself necessitated a remedy. See. e.e., lA. 13597-98, 15572-73 (Stolee \nPlan identifying \"a growing and moving population\" as one of several \nfactors creating instability in student assignment under the pre-l992 sys· \ntern of pairing and satelliting); I.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the \nU.S. Department of Education listing \"demographic and residential pat \nterns\" as one of several increasing strains on the pairing system); I.A. \n2712 (testimony of former CMS Superintendent Iohn Murphy that \"[w]e \nreally weren't going to be bringing about desegregation and racially bal \nanced schools unless we began to address the issue of housing at the \nsame time. H). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in \nresponse to, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, ~ \nsupra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that \nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white \nand black population centers, would put a greater strain on the process \nof desegregation. \n57 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 56 of 128\n\nof past discrimination. The effect of such a holding in Freeman would \nhave been to overrule Green, which the Supreme Court did not \npur~ \nport to do. In Green, even though the school board allowed every stu \ndent \"freedom of choice  as to which school to attend, the formerly \nn \nblack: school remained all black and the formerly white school \nremained predominantly white  wholly as a result, in some sense, \n~-\nof this \"private choice.\" The Green Court held that, although the pri \nvate choices of students and their families were responsible for the \ncontinuing racial isolation of the schools' student populations. that \nfact did not preclude a finding that the racial isolation was also a ves \ntige of past discrimination. Indeed, the Court held not only that it was \npermissible for the school board to take further action to desegregate, \nbut that die board was required to take further action in order to fulfill \nits \"affinnative duty\" to desegregate. Green. 391 U.S. at 437-38. \nAlthough Freeman recognized that, at a certain point in the process \nof desegregation, a court may detennine that present racial isolation \ncannot be considered a by-product of the past regime of segregation, \nthe case dOC's .not require .- or even empower -- a school board \nunder a judicial desegregation order to make that determination on its \nown. Rather, so'fong as CMS was under court order to desegregate, \nit was required to treat racial isolation in its schools as a vestige of \nsegregation, and to take appropriate action to eliminate that vestige. \nSee Swann, 402 U.S. at 26. \n2. \nThe Capacchione plaintiffs next contend that the expanded magnet \nprogram's race-conscious assignment policy violated the desegrega \ntion orders governing this case. With this argument, Judge Potter \nagreed. concluding that \"the way that CMS's magnet program uses \nrace . . . is significantly different from any assignment policy ordered \nor approved of in Swann,\" and thus constituted a \"material departure\" \nfrom the governing desegregation orders. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. \n2d at 286-87. \nThat holding constituted clear error. Actually, Judge McMillan ms: \ncifically authorized and incorporated into his decree a race-conscious \nassignment policy for \"appropriately integrated optional schools.  379 \nII \nF. Supp. at 1103.

The SChild enroll \nment of the OPtional school may have to be guided by its \nracial composition and by the number drawn from each \nother school area, not by considerations of space and pro \ngram only. \nId. at 1108' (emphasis added).2.5 \n. -\n. \nMoreover, one need look no further than Chief lustice Burger's \nopinion for the Supreme Court in Swann to find explicit sanction of \nthe use of racial \"ratios\" or proportions in assigning students to \nschools: \nSchool authorities are traditionally charged with broad \npower to fonnulate and implement education policy and \nmight well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare \nstudents to live in a pluralistic society each school should \nhave a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting \nthe proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an \neducational policy is within the broad discretionary powers \nof school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional \nviolation, however, that would not be within the authority of \na federal court. \n2.5 In accord with this court-approved policy, from 1975 to 1991, prior \nto expansion of the magnet schools plan, CMS continued to use a race \nconscious lottery system to control enrollment in optional, or magnet, \nschools. See I.A. 2489-91, 2822-23, 14502, 16885-89. \n59 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 58 of 128\n\n402 U.S. at 16 (emphasis added). \nJudge McMillan's orders also repeatedly endorse the Board's \npower and duty to maintain control over the racial composition of the \nschools in order to eliminate the vestiges of the segregated system \n\"root and branch.\" For instance, in 1970 Judge McMillan mandated: \nThat the defendants maintain a continuing control over the \nrace of children in each school . . . and maintain the racial \nmake-up of each school (including any new and any re \nopened schools) to prevent any school from becoming \nracially identifiable .... The duty imposed by the law and \nby this order is the desegregation of schools and the mainte \nnance of that condition. . . . The defendants are encouraged \nto use their full \"know-how\" and resources to attain the \nresults above described, and thus to achieve the constitu \ntional end by any means at their disposal. The test is not the \nmethod or plan, but the results. \n311 F. Supp. at 768-69 (emphasis added and emphasis omitted); see \nalso 475 F. Supp: at 1342 (approving counsel's statement that \"if this \nBoard of Education chose to run an integrated school system on the \nbasis of preconceived ratios, it has that constitutional right\") (empha \nsis added); 318 F. Supp. at 801 (ordering \"[t]hat 'freedom of choice' \nor 'freedom of transfer' may not be allowed by the Board if the cumu \nlative effect of any given transfer or group of transfers is to increase \nsubstantially the degree of segregation in the school from which the \ntransfer is requested or in the school to which the transfer is desired\"). \nThus, even if Judge McMillan had not specifically approved a race \nconscious assignment policy for magnet schools, the Board's adop \ntion of the 60-40 formula and lottery in the expanded magnet program \nwould not be an \"ultra vires\" act. Rather, that policy would fall within \nthe Board's broad discretion, recognized by both Judge McMillan and \nthe Supreme Court in Swann, to fashion appropriate remedies in light \nof the particular needs of its pupils and the school system's experi \nence with other desegregation 1OOls.26 \n26 Judge McMillan's orders and the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann \ndid consistently signal concern with the imposition of racial proportions \n60 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 59 of 128\n\nJudge Potter's conclusion to the contrary simply cannot be recon \nciled with the Supreme Court opinion in Swann and Judge McMil \nlan's decrees. The race-conscious assignment policy constitutes a \nnecessary safeguard against the risk that unchecked transfers to mag \nnet schools could increase the number of racially identifiable schools \nin violation of the Board's continuing obligation under the desegrega \ntion orders. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (\"Racially identifiable schools \nmay not be operated. \"). In that vein, the CaDacchione plaintiffs' own \nexpert on school desegregation, Dr. David Armor, agreed that racial \nquotas are permissible in a desegregation plan. J.A. 3627. Dr. Armor \ntestified that \"race is an integral part of pairing, of satelliting. of mag \nnet schools, of running lotteries for magnet schools. The entire plan \nis predicated on race and race controls, because that's the only way \nyou can meet the court order and to have an effective plan is to \nemploy race requirements and racial quotas basically for all schools. \" \nJ.A.3434. \nNor can Judge Potter's disapproval of the expanded magnet \nschools prdgt.am be reconciled with other court-approved aspects of \nthe eMS desegregation plan. For example, the magnet schools assign \ntakes \nment policy  \"race into account in much the same way as the \nBoard's majority-ta-minority transfer policy. which was also specifi-\nor ratios by federal courts. That concern, however, is rooted in the prob \nlem of federal courts exceeding their remedial discretion, not in any \nobjection to the use of racial proportions or ratios by school boards in \ntheir desegregation plans. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that, \"[t]he \nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every \nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of \nthe school system as a whole,\" but went on to conclude that \"the very \nlimited use made of mathematical ratios was within the equitable reme \ndial discretion of the District Court.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25. That this \nconcern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial power to order \nremedial action, not in the impropriety of using racial proportions to rem \nedy the vestiges of segregation. is nowhere more apparent than in Chief \nJustice Burger's statement  There the Chief Justice noted that \nin~. \nwhile in certain circumstances it might be inappropriate for a federal \ncourt to require adherence to \"a prescribed ratio of Negro to white stu \ndents reflecting\" the population of the \"district as a whole\". it would be \n\"within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities\" to do so. Id. \nat 16. \n61 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 60 of 128\n\ncally authorized by the governing desegregation orders. Under the \ntransfer policy, a student in the racial majority in his current school \ncould freely transfer to a school in which he would be in the racial \nminority. A white student in a majority white school, for example, \ncould freely transfer to a majority black school, but that same student \ncould be denied admission to a different majority white school, solely \non the basis of a rigid 50% racial ceiling. Meanwhile, a black student \nat a majority black school could freely transfer into the same majority \nwhite school to which the white student might be denied admission. \nThe Supreme Court approved this use of majority-tcrminority transfer \npolicies as \"a useful part of every desegregation plan\" and \"an indis \npensable remedy.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 26. \nJudge Potter misread the orders and injunctions governing this case \nby focusing solely on isolated words and phrases to conclude that the \ndesegregation decrees \"firmIy rejected the use of rigid racial quotas.\" \nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 286. Actually, in the same paragraph \nthat Judge McMillan held that \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils in particular \nschools will oot be set\" by the court, he also held that \"efforts should \nbe made [by the ,school board] to reach a 71-29 ratio in the various \nschools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school \nis racially different from the others.\" 306 F. Supp. at 1312 (emphasis \nadded). Judge Potter transmuted this statement -- a requirement that \nthe Board make \"efforts\" to \"reach a 71-29 ratio\" -- into a prohibition \nagainst the Board assigning students to schools on the basis of that \nfixed ratio. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 286. We cannot \naccept this reading of Judge McMillan's order. Taken as a whole, this \nparagraph provides some of the clearest evidence that Judge McMil \nlan not only authorized the Board to use fixed ratios in assigning stu \ndents to schools but encouraged it to do so. Recognizing the \nimpracticability of adopting a court-ordered, system-wide racial bal \nance to which all schools must adhere, Judge McMillan did observe \nthat \"variations from that [71-29 ratio) may be unavoidable.\" 306 F. \nSupp. at 1312. But that statement imposes no limitations on the scope \nof permissible Board action. Rather, it suggests that \"variations\" were \nacceptable only because they were \"unavoidable. \" \nIndeed, the Board could not have accomplished what the desegre \ngation orders required it to accomplish without \"using race\" in the \nway that it \"used race\" in the context of the expanded magnet schools \n62 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 61 of 128\n\nprogram. In the 1970 order that was affirmed. by the Supreme Court. \nJudge McMillan decreed \"[t]hat pupils of all grades be assigned in \nsuch a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various \ngrade levels have about the same proportion of black and white stu \ndents.\" 311 F. Supp. at 268. We cannot fathom how the Board could \nset out to achieve \"about the same proportion of black and white stu \ndents\" in each grade level in each of its over one hundred schools \nwithout employing fixed racial ratios as the central components of its \nstudent assignment plan. Neither, apparently, could Judge McMillan. \nTo achieve \"about the same proportion,\" the Board necessarily had \nto set fixed upper and lower limits on the proportion of white and \nblack students it would permit in each grade in each school. Only \nwith these fixed racial proportions as its lodestars could the Board \nassign students to schools, and approve or deny individual requests to \ntransfer. The Board could never have justified a denial of a transfer \nrequest without having a fixed conception of how few white or black \nstudents in a particular school would be too few. \nIn sum, contrary_to Judge Potter's conclusion, Judge McMillan \nspecifically authorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assign \ning students to magnet schools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1104. Further \nmore, even without such specific authorization, the broad discretion \ngranted the Board by the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann and by \nthe other court orders and injunctions governing this case permitted \nCMS to fashion magnet schools with racially balanced enrollments. \nThe decrees make plain that ratios based on race were among the \n\"means\" by which the Board was authorized\"to achieve the constitu \ntional end\" of desegregation. \n3. \nFinally, the Capacchione plaintiffs maintain that, even if CMS \nadministered the expanded magnet schools program pursuant to and \nin conformity with the governing desegregation decrees, CMS vio \nlated the Constitution in doing so. Judge Potter rejected this argument, \nas do we. \na. \nIn fact, court-ordered remedial action cannot be found violative of \nthe Constitution. Rather, as Judge Potter recognized, actions taken by \n63 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 62 of 128\n\nCMS pursuant to the desegregation decrees are immune from consti \ntutional attack. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (\"CMS enjoys \nimmunity from liability for any actions it took consistent with the \nCourt's injunction. \"). \nThe Supreme Court has clearly and unequivocally proclaimed that \n\"persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdic \ntion are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed, \neven if they have prqper grounds to object to the order.\" GTE Syl \nvania.lnc. v. Consumers Union of the United States, 445 U.S. 375, \n386 (1980) (emphasis added); see also W.E. Grace & Co. v. Local \nUnion 759,461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). Under this \"established doc \ntrine,\" Ym. 445 U.S. at 386, an injunction unconstitutional on its \nface must nonetheless be obeyed. See Walker v. City of Birmingham, \n388 U.S. 307, 317 (1967). \"[D)isobedience of such an outstanding \norder of a federal court subjects the violator to contempt even though \nhis constitutional claim might be later upheld.\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at \n439. Thus, so long as CMS acts -- as it has - to desegregate its \nschools in .accordance with existing injunctive orders, its actions can \nnot be challeng~ as unconstitutional. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has twice expressly held that school \nboards under court orders to desegregate must comply with those \norders until absolved of that obligation by a subsequent court order. \neven when the existing desegregation order is improper or unneces \nsary. In Spansler, the Court concluded that the district court exceeded \nits remedial discretion when it ordered the Pasadena school district to \nreconfigure its student attendance zones annually so that there would \nbe \"no majority of any minority\" in any school. 427 U.S. at 434-35. \nDespite the impropriety of this order, the Court held that the school \nboard was obliged to obey it until it was properly and explicitly modi \nfied by a court. See id. at 438-40. \nSimilarly. in Dowell, the Court refused to interpret an arguably \nambiguous court order as having tenninated the desegregation decree \npreviously entered against the Oklahoma City school board. Instead, \nthe Court remanded the case to the district court for a clear detennina \ntion of \"whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitu \ntional compliance . . . to allow the injunction to be dissolved. \" 498 \nU.S. at 249. In doing so, the Court explained that judicial orders carry \n64 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 63 of 128\n\nbinding authority until they are modified or dissolved and admon \nished district courts to provide the parties with a \"precise statement\" \nwhen modifying or dissolving a desegregation decree. Id. at 246; ~ \nalso Dayton Bd. ofEduc. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 421 (\"a school \nboard and a school constituency which attempt to comply with a \n[desegregation] plan to the best of their ability should not be penal \nized\"). \nIn short, the Ca,pacchione plaintiffs could have sought to modify \nor dissolve the Sn.ml orders as inconsistent with their rights under \nthe Constitution; what they could not do is obtain an injunction, or \ndeclaration, that a party compelled to adhere to those orders violated \nthe Constitution in doing so. CMS's obligation to follow the desegre \ngation orders and injunctions in this case provides it with a complete \ndefense to the Capacchione plaintiffs  challenge to the expanded \nI \nmagnet schools program. \nb. \nThe Capacchione plaintiffs ignore the controlling authority set \nforth above and Instead rely on inapposite case law in attempting to \nestablish that Board actions taken pursuant to court-ordered desegre \ngation decrees can be held unconstitutional. \nSpecifically, they rely on recent decisions finding voluntarv, race \nconscious magnet school programs (not developed under a governing \ndesegregation order) unconstitutional. See Eisenber& v. Montgomery \nCounty Pub. Sch .• 197 F.3d 123, 125 (4th Cir. 1999); Tuttle v. Arling \nton County Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Wess \nmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998). In fact, in those cases, \nthe courts emphasized that the school system had !!21 been under a \ncourt order to desegregate, see Eisenberg, 197 F.3d at 124, and had \nadopted a magnet program \"!!21 to remedy past discrimination. but \nrather to promote racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity. \" Tuttle, \n195 F.3d at 700 (emphasis added); see also Wessman, 160 F.3d at 792 \n(noting that prior to instituting its magnet program the school system \n\"had achieved unitariness in the area of student assignments\" and that \n\"the district court thereupon relinquished control over\" that area). \nIndeed, in Eisenberg we endorsed the permissibility of race-based \nclassifications \"in situations.\" like that at hand, \"where past constitu-\n65 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 64 of 128\n\ncourts must follow that precedent \"even if later cases appear to call \nit into question, leaving to [the Supreme) Court the prerogative of \noverruling its own decisions.\" See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, \n237 (1997). \nThere could hardly be a clearer case for application of this princi-\nple. Here the Supreme Court's Swann decision itself constitutes \ndirectly controlling precedent. In Swann, the Court concluded that \nCMS could be constitutionally required to make efforts \"to reach a \n71-29 ratio\" in the schools under its authority, and to assign students \n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at var \nious grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white \nstudents.\" ~ 402 U.S. at 23-25 (approving Judge McMillan's order). \nIndeed, the Supreme Court again noted in Freeman  that its decision \nin Slnm! specifically approved racial balancing by CMS to achieve \nthe remedial end of eliminating the vestiges of segregation. 503 U.S. \nat 493 (In~. \"[w]e confmned that racial balance in school \nassignments was a necessary part of the remedy in the circumstances \nthere presented. It). Under the principle articulated in Agostini, only \nthe Supreme CQort itself can modify the decrees in this case to pro \nhibit what Swami so clearly permitted. \nC. \nThe Supreme Court's decision in ~ is the law of the case; it \nmust be followed. But more than just the law of this case, for almost \nthirty years ~ also has functioned as a blueprint for school \ndesegregation in school districts throughout this Nation. As long as \nSwann is controlling law. and as long as the Board acts pursuant to \nthe ~ desegregation orders -- as it did in implementing the \nexpanded magnet schools program -- it cannot be held to have vio \nlated the Constitution. \nN. \nJudge Potter also enjoined CMS from  assigning children to \nn \nschools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through \nrace-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that deny \nstudents an equal footing based on race.\" Capacchione. 57 F. Supp. \n2d at 294. In considering the propriety of an injunction, we review \n67 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 65 of 128\n\nfactual findings only for clear error, but the \"district court's applica \ntion of legal principles . . . presents a legal question reviewed de \nnovo.\" North Carolina v. City of Virginia Beach, 951 F.2d 596, 601 \n(4th Cir. 1992). Given our holding that CMS has not yet reached uni \ntary status and did not violate the constitutional rights of the Capac \nchione plaintiffs by consideration of race in its expanded magnet \nschools program, there is no legal basis for the district court's injunc \ntion. Accordingly, we must vacate it. \nMoreover, because \"federal court decrees must directly address and \nrelate to the constitutional violation itself,\" Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282, \nwe would be compelled to vacate the injunction as overly broad even \nif some fonn of injunctive relief had been warranted. The expanded \nmagnet schools program was the only CMS action that the district \ncourt found to violate the Constitution -- Judge Potter did not con \nsider the constitutionality of any other method of student assignment \nor resource allocation. Yet the injunction by its terms encompasses \nany consideration of race by CMS in student assignment or allocation \nof educational benefits that \"den[ies] students an equal footing.\" \nCapacchione,  1:. Supp. 2d at 294. The injunction thus goes much \n5~ \nfarther than simply prohibiting CMS from reinstituting the expanded \nmagnet schools program and its race-conscious assignment policy. \nWe have repeatedly held similar injunctions too broad, explaining that \n\"[a]lthough injunctive relief should be designed to grant the relief \nneeded to remedy the injury to the prevailing party, it should not go \nbeyond the extent of the established violation.\" Hayes, 10 F.3d at 217; \nsee also Tuttle, 195 F.3d at 708. \nIf the district court determines on remand, based on the standards \nset forth herein, that CMS has attained unitary status, it may issue an \ninjunction only to the extent that it concludes that CMS is likely to \npersist in current practices that would violate the Constitution if \nundertaken outside of the remedial context. See United States v. Ore \ngon State Med. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952). Even then, the dis \ntrict court should be reluctant to issue such an injunction because \"the \nultimate objective\" of federal court involvement in school desegrega \ntion has always been \"to return school districts to the control of local \nauthorities.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. Absent compelling evidence \nto the contrary. it must be assumed that CMS, when it is found to \nhave achieved unitary status, will act in conformity with the law. \n68 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 66 of 128\n\nv. \nIn addition to injunctive relief, the district court awarded nominal \ndamages of one dollar to the Capacchione family \"to vindicate the \nconstitutional rights of children denied an equal footing in applying \nto magnet schools.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. Because we \nhold that the expanded magnet schools program did not violate the \nConstitution, we must also vacate this nominal damages award. \nVI. \nThe district court also awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs \n$1,499,016.47. plus interest in attorney's fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988. See Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 80 F. Supp. \n2d 557 (W.D.N.C. 1999) (amended by orders of December 16, 1999, \nlA. 1313-15. and March 6, 2000, lA. 1356-62). Under that statute, \na court in a civil rights case \"may allow the prevailing party, other \nthan the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the \ncosts.\" 4211.5.C. § 1988. \nIt appears that the\"district court principally based the award of \nattorney's fees on the Caoacchione plaintiffs' success in obtaining \nnominal damages and injunctive relief. Because we have vacated \nthose awards, we must vacate the award of attorney's fees as well. As \nthe Capacchione plaintiffs recognize, it is \"self-evident\" that they \ncannot recover fees \"if this court reverses the order appealed from.\" \nBrief of Appellees at 113 n.51. \nMoreover, we would vacate the fee award even if it were based on \nthe district court's declaration that CMS had achieved unitary status. \nOur affirmance of a portion of that declaration -- that CMS has \nachieved unitary status with respect to four of the eight ~ factors \nit considered - does not entitle the Capacchione plaintiffs to attor \nney's fees. In order to be considered a \"prevailing party\" under \n§ 1988, the party seeking fees must have obtained \"an enforceable \njudgment, consent decree, or settlement.\" S-1 & S-2 v. State Bd. of \nEdUC., 21 F.3d 49,51 (4th Cir. 1994) (en bane). Additionally, there \nmust be some defendant in the case who bas been \"prevailed against, \" \nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 109 (1992), with a resulting \"material \nalteration of the legal relationship\" between that defendant and the \n69 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 67 of 128\n\nparty seeking fees. Id. at 111. In obtaining a declaration that the \nBoard has achieved unitary status as to four Green factors. the CAPac \nchione plaintiffs have not obtained \"an enforceable judgment. consent \ndecree, or settlement\"; they have not \"prevailed against\" CMS; nor \nhave they effected a \"material alteration of the legal relationship\" \nbetween the parties. \nFurthermore, even if the Capacchione plaintiffs succeed on remand \nin proving that CMS has achieved unitary status in all respects, they \nwould not, for these same reasons, be entitled to attorney's fees. A \ndeclaration of unitary status merely restores the parties to the status \nquo prior to the issuance of the desegregation decree. Such a declara \ntion would not-constitute \"an enforceable judgment\" for the C@Pacch \nione plaintiffs. And though a declaration of unitary status would \nobviously represent a defeat for the legal position that CMS has taken \nin this litigation, such a defeat would not be tantamount to being \"pre \nvailed against\" under § 1988. Rather, the primary significance of a \ndeclaration of unitary status would be that CMS has succeeded in \neradicating *evestiges of past discrimination to the extent practica \nble and, as the Capacchione plaintiffs put it, in obtaining a \"return to \nlocal control. \" Brief of Appellees at 34. The Board, upon a declara \ntion of unitariness. would actually have wider latitude to assign stu \ndents as it sees fit than it did while it was under court order to remedy \npast discrimination (although certain race-conscious policies might no \nlonger be permissible). We are unable to see how a broadening of the \nBoard's discretion can be viewed as a \"material alteration of the legal \nrelationship\" between CMS and the Capacchione plaintiffs. \nWe note that the predominant pattern in the desegregation cases \nhas been to award attorney's fees to the original prevailing plaintiffs \n-- even for legal work related to the unsuccessful defense of a deseg \nregation decree against a motion to modify or dissolve. See, e.g., Jen \nkins v. Missouri, 127 F.3d 709, 714 (8th Cir. 1997) (en bane) (\"[The \nJenkins class has enjoyed the benefits of prevailing in this litigation \nfor more than a decade. Jenkins m did not void the many remedial \norders issued in this case that have never been reversed during the \nprocess of a direct appeal. H). Properly understood, a declaration of \nunitary status represents the last stage in the process of desegregation, \n70 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 68 of 128\n\nand the school board's success in reaching that last stage is often \nappropriately credited to the original plaintiffs who brought the case.27 \nVII. \nFinally  CMS appeals the district court's order awarding sanctions \nt \n-- including legal fees and costs -- to the Ca,gacchione plaintiffs \narising from a discovery dispute. In the months before trial, CMS did \nnot respond to interrogatories by the Ca,gacchione plaintiffs seeking \ndisclosure of fact witnesses. Instead, the Board waited until the week \nbefore trial to reveal the names of most of its fact witnesses, provid \ning the Capacchione plaintiffs with a list of 174 names which it ulti \nmately narrowed to twenty-six potential witnesses. The Board \nmaintains that its actions complied with the district court's pretrial \norder. which required the parties to provide a list of fact witnesses to \neach other \"[n]o later than the morning of the first day of trial. \" I.A. \n150. \nThe district cOurt. however, granted the Capacchione plaintiffs' \nmotion for sancpons. The court held that it had established the rules \nfor disclosure of- fact witnesses in an order of September 1998, which \nsuperseded the pretrial order. The September 1998 order denied the \nCapacchione plaintiffs' motion to compel disclosure of witnesses \nprior to the date established in the pretrial order for disclosure of \nexpert witnesses, but the court stated that \"CMS must supplement its \nresponses, as it promised, when such information becomes known. \" \nJ.A. 195. In awarding sanctions, the district court also indicated its \nconcern that CMS had been \"lacking candor in disclosing relevant \nand important information\" during the pretrial stage, that the disclo \nsure of a list of 174 potential witnesses in the week before trial was \n\"extremely prejudicial to opposing counsel,\" and that many of the \nwitnesses on the list may have been \"irrelevant or unnecessarily \ncumulative.\" J.A. 305. As a result. the district court ordered a one \nweek recess after the Capacchione plaintiffs' presentation at trial to \nallow them to depose, at the school system's expense, any of the \ntwenty-six witnesses on the Board's revised list.

Inc., 872 F.2d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 1989), CMS could \nplausibly have understood the deadline for disclosure of fact wit \nnesses contained in the pretrial order to have continued in effect after \nthe subsequent September 1998 order given that the subsequent \norder's central effect was to reaffirm the deadline contained in the \npretrial order for disclosure of expert witnesses. Nonetheless, we can \nnot say that the district court abused its broad discretion in finding \nthat its September 1998 order did in fact supersede the pretrial order, \nand that the Board's pretrial conduct had been unnecessarily dilatory \nand prejudicial to the Capacchione plaintiffs. We therefore affirm the \norder of sanctions against CMS. \nvm. \nFor more than a' hundred years, in fits and starts, our nation has \nattempted to undo the effects of its shameful heritage of slavery. For \nnearly fifty years, federal courts have struggled with the task of dis \nmantling legally enforced racial segregation in many of our schools. \nThis task has given rise to one of the preeminent issues of constitu \ntionallaw in our time. We do not yet know how history will regard \nthe courts' role in adjudicating and presiding over the desegregation \nof schools. It may be seen as a brief and unfortunate jurisprudential \nanomaly, justified only by the immediacy of the evil it was intended \nto uproot, cf. Freeman, S03 U.S. at 505-07 (Scalia, J., concurring); or \nit may be recognized as the necessarily sustained effort to eradicate \ndeep-seated vestiges of racial discrimination and to vindicate the \npromise of the Fourteenth Amendment, cf. Dowell, 498 U.S. at 266-\n68 (Marshall, J., dissenting); or it may be viewed in some other way \nthat we cannot now anticipate. Our decision today does not attempt \nan answer. \nBut we are certain that the end of this great task must be accom \nplished in an orderly manner, consistent with and true to its origin. \nWe are certain, too, that if the courts, at some point, come to view the \n72 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 70 of 128\n\neffort to eliminate the vestiges of segregation as having been overly \n\"race-conscious,\" they must do so with a clear assessment of the his \ntorical record. \nRace neutrality, of course, represents one of our constittltional ide \nals. Properly understood, it is an ideal not at all in tension with our \nobligation as a society to undo the effects of slavery and of the racial \ncaste system that was perpetuated, for more than a centtlry, in slav \nery's wake. But we must be ever mindful, as we strive for race neu \ntrality, that a reductive and willfully ahistorical conception of race \nneutrality was, in an earlier era, used as a blunt instrument against the \naspirations of African-Americans merely seeking to claim entitlement \nto full citizenship. \nIn striking down early civil rights legislation, the Supreme Court \nembraced this misconceived race neutrality, reasoning, only twenty \nyears after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, that the \nlegislation at issue would illegitimately make black citizens \"the spe \nat \ncial favorite  the laws.\" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 2S (1883). \nIndeed, the  of segregation with which we are concerned was \nsys~m \njustified at its inception by a particular conception of race neutrality \n-- that a regime of racial separation could be constittltionally justified \nso long as it applied neutrally and equally to persons of all races. See \nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551 (1896) (\"We consider the \nunderlying fallacy of the plaintiff s argument to consist in the \nassumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the \ncolored race with a badge of inferiority. H). \nThe first Justice Harlan, dissenting in fkm, declared our Consti \nttltion to be \"color-blind,\" id., 163 U.S. at 559, and in doing so pro \nvided one of the most famous and compelling articulations of the \nconstittltional guarantee of equality. But in urging us to be \"blind\" to \nrace, Justice Harlan did not, as is sometimes suggested, suggest that \nwe be ignorant of it. In Plessy, he was the only member of the Court \nwilling to acknowledge the most obvious truth about segregation: \n\"Everyone knows that the stattlte in question had its origin in the pur \npose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occu \npied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied \nor assigned to white persons.\" Id. at 557. Thirteen years earlier, dis \nsenting in the Civil Rights Cases, Justice Harlan rejected the notion \n73 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 71 of 128\n\nthat civil rights legislation made blacks a \"special favorite of the \nlaws,\" id., 109 U.S. at 61, and he criticized the majority's reasoning \nas \"narrow and artificial.\" Id. at 26. \nWe recognize now, as Justice Harlan recognized then, that no sim \nple syllogism can enfold all of history's burdens and complexities. \nEliminating race-consciousness from government decisionmaking \nmust be regarded as among our worthiest constitutional aspirations. \nBut that aspiration surely cannot be so rigid that it refuses to distin \nguish the \"race consciousness\" that created a segregated school sys \ntem and the race-conscious efforts necessary to eliminate that system. \nWhile most judges are not historians, we must be willing to acknowl \nedge and tonfr~nt our history. If we fail to do so, we risk falling into \na mode that equates the cure with the disease: civil rights with favorit \nism, desegregation with segregation. As American citizens, we know \nbetter. \nWe must and do sympathize with those who are impatient with \ncontinued federal court involvement in the operation of local schools. \nThirty-five years could be considered a long time for a school district \nto operate under'Jiidiciai desegregation decrees. However, when the \nSupreme Court decided Swann in 1971 no one could reasonably have \nthought that the substantial task described there would be quickly or \neasily accomplished. CMS, which maintained a separate, decidedly \nunequal dual educational system for decades -- and which mightily \nresisted desegregation of any sort for years after it became the law of \nthe land -- has come a long way. While CMS has now achieved uni \ntary status in certain respects, this record simply does not support a \ndetermination that the process of desegregation is at an end. Nor does \nit support a holding that CMS violated the Constitution when, pursu \nant to court orders, it undertook judicially approved action to remedy \nits own long history of racial segregation. \nPursuant to the foregoing, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate \nin certain respects, and remand this case to the district court for fur \nther proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nAFFIRMED IN PART. REVERSED IN PART. \nVACATED IN PART. AND REMANDED \n74 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 72 of 128\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: \nFifty years ago a number of school boards ran schools with intent \nto divide the races. Black children went to predominantly black \nschools and were taught by black teachers. White children were \ntaught by white teachers in white schools. Equal resources and oppor \ntunities were denied African-American children. In 1954 the Supreme \nCourt declared these practices to be violative of the constitutional \nrights of black children to equal protection of the laws. Federal courts \nwere directed to oversee the dismantling of segregated school sys \ntems, Charlotte-Mecklenburg's included. When the old system was \nended and a constitutional system was in place, the federal courts \nwere to get out of the education business and to return the schools to \nthe control of the people elected to run them. \nThe district court began its oversight of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nschool system in 1965 and over the next few years worked with the \nschool system to develop a plan that would bring the school district \ninto compliaJice with the law. By 1975 the court concluded that the \ndesegregation p'lan in place then would work and that the case could \nbe closed as an active matter. \nSince that time two generations of students have passed through \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg's schools and, until the present case, not one \nperson has been back to court alleging that past segregative practices \nhave been continued. That is because the former system has been \neliminated to the extent practicable. \nYet now, when an effort is made to end federal court control, the \nschool board resists. The board would have the public and this court \nbelieve that for the last twenty years it has operated a school system \nwhich has continued to discriminate against African-American \nschoolchildren in disregard of both reason and the district court's \norder. If this is true, the people of Mecklenburg County should be out \nraged. But, of course, it is not true. The district court found it not to \nbe true and it reached that conclusion for solid reasons. \nBecause I believe the facts show Charlotte-Mecklenburg has been \nsuccessful in its efforts to eliminate the segregative practices of the \npast, I cannot agree with a ruling that will keep the school district \n75 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 73 of 128\n\nunder the yoke of federal court control. Mecklenburg County's posi \ntion as a progressive metropolitan area is fact and not facade, and the \ntime has come to return the school system to it. Therefore, I dissent \nfrom a holding that would do otherwise. \nI further would find unconstitutional a policy that would deny a \nchild an open seat in a magnet school because of the color of the \nchild's skin. For that reason I also dissent from a holding that would \nreverse the district judge and permit such a practice. \nI. \nIn 1896, the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana statute \"providing \nfor separate railway carriages for the white and colored races. \" Plessy \nv. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 540 (1896). The Plessy majority charac \nterized the statute as \"not necessarily imply[ing] the inferiority of \neither race,\" id. at 544, but the first Justice Harlan, in dissent, aptly \ndescribed the true aim of the law: \"Everyone knows that the statute \nin question pad its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white \npersons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored \npeople from coacnes occupied by or assigned to white persons.\" .kl \nat 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan further \"den[ied) that \nany legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race \nof citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved.\" Id. at \n554-55 (Harian, J., dissenting). Unfortunately, the principle of \"sepa \nrate but equal\" reached much farther than Louisiana railways, and was \napplied to other public services, including education. The march of \nprogress eventually proved the correctness of Justice Harlan's princi \npled stand. Segregation, in all of its manifestations, was \"arbitrary\" \nand \"wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality \nbefore the law established by the Constitution.\" Id. at 561-62 (Harian, \nJ., dissenting). \nEarly efforts aimed at combating the injustice wrought by Plessy \nin educational settings often centered on state-funded graduate and \nprofessional schools. See. e.g., Missouri ex reI. Gaines v. Canada, \n305 U.S. 337 (1938); see generally Mark V. Tushnet, The NAACP's \nLegal Strategy Against Segregated Education 1925-1950 (1987). In \n~, an African-American student was denied admission to the \nUniversity of Missouri School of Law on account of his race. Mis-\n76 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 74 of 128\n\nsouri had no \"separate but equal\" law school for its African-American \ncitizens and instead offered to pay Gaines' tuition and expenses for \na legal education in another state. The Supreme Court held that Mis \nsouri's offer denied Gaines equal protection of the laws. The Court \nobserved that \"[t]he admissibility of laws separating the races in the \nenjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the \nequality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups \nwithin the State.\" Gaines, 305 U.S. at 349. Though providing only \nsmall victories, cases like Gaines exposed \"separate but equal\" for the \nuntenable proposition that it was. \nIn 1954, the Supreme Court recognized the futility of measuring \nequality in segregated facilities. See Brown v. Board ofEduc., 347 \nn. \nU.S. 483 (1954) (Brown  Presented with a direct attack on \n~ \nin a secondary education case, the Court held that \"segregation of \nchildren in public schools solely on the basis of race\" violated the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 493. \nThe Court emphasized that an educational \"opportunity. where a state \nhas undertB.tcen to provide it, is a right which must be made available \nto all on equal te_rms. \" Id. Recognizing that segregation differed from \nlocality to locality, the Supreme Court subsequently declined to craft \na broad. one-size-fits-all remedy. and instead instructed the federal \ndistrict courts to oversee the implementation of appropriate relief \nbased on the dictates of local circumstances. See Brown v. Board of \n~, 349 U.S. 294.299 (1955) (Brown II) (\"Because of their prox \nimity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings, \nthe courts which originally heard these cases can best perform th[e] \njudicial appraisal. \"). The district courts were directed to make use of \nthe \"traditional attributes of equity power,\" id. at 300, to ensure that \nstudents were \"admit[ted] to public schools on a racially nondiscrimi \nnatory basis,\" id. at 301. However, under the Brown opinions it was \nunclear whether a school district was required to take affirmative \nsteps to remedy the constitutional violation, see, e.g., Briggs v. Elliott, \n132 F. Supp. 776, 777 (E.D.S.C. 1955) (holding that Brown merely \nprohibited school districts from using the force of law to separate the \nraces), and very little progress resulted. \nBefore the Supreme Court provided further guidance to the lower \nfederal courts, the original ~ plaintiffs in 1965 challenged as \nconstitutionally inadequate the efforts of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \n77 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 75 of 128\n\nSchools (\"CMS\") in complying with Brown. The school district's \ndesegregation plan was based on freedom of choice whereby \"any \nchild, without regard to race, and without regard to minority or major \nity of race in any particular school, might freely transfer to another \nschool of his choice.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bel. of Educ., \n243 F. Supp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965). The district court approved \nthe plan, observing that more could be done \"to increase mixing of \nthe races,\" but that the law imposed \"no such duty upon ... the \nSchool Board. \" Id. at 670. \nConcerned at the slow pace of school desegregation throughout the \nnation, the Supreme Court held in 1968 that school boards had an \"af \nfirmative'lJuty~ to end the state-imposed dual system of education. \nGreen v. County Sch. Bet, 391 U.S. 430,437 (1968). The Justices \nunderscored that \"in desegregating a dual system a plan utilizing \n, freedom of choice' is not an end in itself. \" Id. at 440. The Swann \nplaintiffs then filed in the district court a motion for further relief \n\"seek[ing] greater speed in desegregation of the Charlotte \nMecklenburg--schools, and request[ing] elimination of certain other \nalleged racial ~9..ualities. \" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bel. of \nEduc., 300 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The district court, \nguided by the mandate of Green, see Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1362, \nmade a number of factual findings and concluded that the school dis \ntrict remained highly segregated. \nThe district court noted that over half of CMS's 24,000 black stu \ndents \"attend schools that are all black, or very nearly all black, and \nmost of the 24,000 have no white teachers.\" Id. at 1360. However, the \ncourt found no violations \"in the use of federal funds; the use of \nmobile classrooms; quality of school buildings and facilities; athlet \nics; PIA   activities; school fees; free lunches; books; elective courses; \nnor in individual evaluation of students.\" Id. at 1372. \nThe district court directed eMS to submit \"a positive plan for fac \nulty desegregation effective in the fall of 1969, and a plan for effec \ntive desegregation of pupil population, to be predominantly effective \nin the fall of 1969 and to be completed by the fall of 1970.\" Id. at \n1360. The board procrastinated, but eventually submitted an ener \nvated desegregation plan that the district court approved \"with great \nreluctance\" on a temporary basis. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg \n78 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 76 of 128\n\nBd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS offi \ncials, however, continued to drag their feet, and the district court was \nforced to appoint its own expert, Dr. John A. Finger, to craft an effi \ncacious desegregation plan. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. \nof Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265 (W.D.N.C. 1970). Dr. Finger's plan, \nadopted by the district court, included limited use of mathematical \nratios, pairing and grouping of school zones, and busing. See id. We \naffinned a portion of the plan, but vacated provisions dealing with the \nbusing of elementary school students because of the perceived bur \ndens on small children and the cost of purchasing new buses. See \nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bel. of Educ., 431 F.2d 138. 147 \n(4th. Cir. 1970) (en bane). We remanded \"for reconsideration of the \nassignment of pupils in the elementary schools. \" Id. The Supreme \nCourt granted certiorari and reinstated the district court's plan pend. \ning further proceedings. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bel. of \nEduc., 399 U.S. 926 (1970). The district court conducted eight days \nof hearings and examined five different desegregation plans. The dis \ntrict court concluded the Finger plan to be the best of the five, encom \npassing \"a~reasonable ... collection of methods for solving the \nproblem\" of th~ ~pal system. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bel. of \nEdY£.:., 318 F. Supp. 786, 800 (W.D.N.C. 1970). As for busing and the \ncost of new buses, the district court found that the Finger plan took \n\"proper advantage of traffic movement\" and that new buses would \ncost only $660,000, a far cry from the millions of dollars that CMS \nhad originally estimated. See id. at 797-98. Two months later, the \nSupreme Court granted certiorari and undertook an in-depth review \nof the power of the federal district courts to craft such sweeping \ndesegregation remedies. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of \nEm!£.,., 402 U.S. 1 (1971). \nThe Supreme Court affinned. the desegregation plan adopted by the \ndistrict court, and in the course of its opinion identified and offered \nguidance in \"four problem areas.\" Id. at 22. First, the Court addressed \nthe issue of the district court's use of racial ratios. While the Supreme \nCourt approved of a limited use of mathematical ratios in a plan \ncrafted by a district court, it emphasized that such ratios were \"a start \ning point ... rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25. The \nCourt reminded district courts that \"[t]he constitutional conunand to \ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every commu \nnity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system \n79 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 77 of 128\n\nas a whole.\" Id. at 24. Second, the Court dealt with single-race \nschools. Though the Court concluded that schools consisting of pre \ndominantly one race were not per se unconstitutional, the Court \ninstructed the district courts to utilize \"close scrutiny to detennine that \nschool assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation. \" Id. at \n26. Third, the Court considered alterations of attendance zones. The \nCourt held \"that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school \nzones is a pennissible tool,\" id. at 28, but declined to craft \"rigid \nrules\" in light of differing local circumstances, id. at 29. Finally, the \nCourt tackled the busing issue. The Court confirmed that a district \ncourt could order \"bus transportation as one tool of school desegrega \ntion,\" but within reasonable time and distance restrictions. Id. at 30. \nShortly after the Supreme Court issued its landmark Swann opin-\nion, CMS asked the district court to abandon the Finger plan and per \nmit the substitution of a \"feeder plan\" whereby schools would draw \npupils from designated attendance areas in an effort to keep children \ntogether for their entire public school career. See Swann v. Charlotte \nMecklenbullJ·Bd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346 (W.O. N.C. 1971). Cit \ning concerns of ~esegregation and the placement of additional burdens \non African-AmerIcan children, the district court questioned the feeder \nplan. See id. at 1350-53. CMS then withdrew its original feeder plan \nand began work on a modified version. See id. at 1353. The district \ncourt eventually approved a revised feeder plan that reopened several \nformer black schools and prevented over- and under-utilization of \nfacilities. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 334 F. \nSupp. 623 (W.O.N.C. 1971). \nHowever, within just two years it became clear that CMS's revised \nfeeder plan was inadequate \"for dealing with foreseeable problems\" \nin the dismantling of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte \nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp. 1223, 1229 (W.D.N.C. \n1973). The district court found \"that various formerly black schools \nand other schools will tum black under the feeder plan, \" id., and that \n\"[r]acial discrimination through official action has not ended in this \nschool system,\" id. at 1230. The district court again instructed CMS \nto design a new pupil assignment plan \"on the premise that equal pro \ntection of laws is here to stay.\" Id. at 1238. \nIn 1974 CMS adopted and the district court approved new guide \nlines and policies for pupil assignment. See Swann v. Charlotte-\n80 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 78 of 128\n\nMecklenbure Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.n.N.C. 1974). The \nplan was designed by a citizens advisory group working with the \nboard in an effort to reach \"an acceptable consensus\" on school deseg· \nregation in CMS. Id. at 1103. The plan's most promising features \nwere the avoidance of any majority black schools (with the exception \nof Hidden Valley, an exempted school), and a more equal distribution \nof the busing burden. See id. at 1105-1110. Praising the board for \nmaking \"a clean break with the essentially' reluctant' attitude which \ndominated Board actions for many years, \" the district court predicted \nthat the policies and positive attitude would eventually result in a uni· \ntary school system. Id. at 1103. \nThe district court closed funlm in 1975 and removed the case from \nthe active docket. See SWann v. Charlotte-Mecklenbure Bd. of Educ., \n67 F.R.O. 648 (W.O. N.C. 1915). In so doing, the district court \nobserved that the board was \"actively and intelligently addressing\" \nrecurrent problems related to dismantlement of the dual system. Id. at \n649. Until the case at bar. the Swann plaintiffs have never attempted \nto reopen th~case in order to address any alleged failure by the board \nto comply with .t~e district court's desegregation orders. \nThe present litigation arose in September 1997 when William \nCapacchione (\"Capacchione\") tiled suit against CMS on behalf of his \ndaughter, Christina, alleging that she had been unconstitutionally \ndenied admission to a magnet school program on account of her race. \nIn 1992, without prior court approval, CMS had adopted a desegrega· \ntion plan focused mainly on the use of magnet schools. In tilling mag \nnet schools, CMS had instituted a black and a non·black lottery to \nachieve racial balance. If a sufficient number of blacks or whites did \nnot apply and fill the seats allotted to their respective races, then CMS \nwould actively recruit children of the desired race despite lengthy \nwaiting lists made up of children of the other race. If the recruitment \ndrive failed, CMS usually left the available slots vacant. Christina, \nwho is white, was placed on a waiting list and eventually denied \nadmission to a program at the Olde Providence magnet school. \nThe original ~ plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and to \nconsolidate it with Capacchione' s suit. They asserted that the vestiges \nof the dual school system had not been abolished and that the use of \nrace in the magnet admissions policy was necessary for the school \n81 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 79 of 128\n\ndistrict to comply with the prior desegregation orders. The district \ncourt granted the motion and later permitted Capacchione to intervene \nin the ~ litigation. Seeking a fmding that CMS had eradicated \nthe vestiges of past discrimination, another group of parents, led by \nMichael P. Grant (\"Grant\"),1 was also permitted to intervene in the lit \nigation. \nAfter a two-month bench trial, the district court determined that \nCMS had achieved unitary status, that the race-based admissions pol \nicy for CMS' s magnet schools fell outside prior orders and was not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and that an \ninjunction was warranted. The district court \"enjoin[ed] CMS from \nany further use of race-based lotteries, preferences, and set-asides in \nstudent assignment.\" Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57 \nF. Supp. 2d 228,292 (W.D.N.C. 1999). Citing interests in stability, \nthe district court concluded that the injunction would not affect stu \ndent assignments for the 1999-2000 school year, but would apply to \nstudent assignments for the 2000-2001 school year. See id. at 292 \nn.52. CMS aad the ~ plaintiffs fIled notices of appeal, and CMS \nmoved to stay the injunction, except as applied to the magnet schools, \nuntil the 2001-02lschool year. The ~ plaintiffs moved for a com \nplete stay pending appeal. On November 15, 1999, the district court \ndenied the motions. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, pursuant to Fed \neral Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(2), moved this court for a stay. \nOn December 30, 1999, we stayed the district court's injunction pend \ning further order of this court. \nII. Unitary Status \nThe district court's unitary status fmding is reviewed for clear \nerror. See Riddick v. School Bd., 784 F.2d 521,533 (4th Cir. 1986); \nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). \"A finding is clearly erroneous when, although \nthere is evidence to support it, on the entire evidence the reviewing \ncourt is left with the defmite and firm conviction that a mistake has \nbeen committed.\" Faulconer v. Commissioner, 748 F.2d 890,895 (4th \nCir. 1984). In clarifying the clearly erroneous standard, the Supreme \nCourt has explained: \n1 Those represented by Capacchione and Grant will be referred to as the \n\"plaintiff-intervenors. \" \n82 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 80 of 128\n\nIf the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in \nlight of the record viewed in its entirety t the court of appeals \nmay not reverse it even though convinced that had it been \nsitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evi \ndence differently. Where there are two permissible views of \nthe evidencet the factfinder's choice between them cannot \nbe clearly erroneous. \nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985). The \nSupreme Court also stressed that even when appellate review is based \nprimarily on documentary evidence, the clearly erroneous standard of \nreview remains the same. See id. at 574. So long as the district court's \nunitary status determination rests on a permissible view of the evi \ndence it must be affirmed. \nt \nThe Supreme Court has declined to define or provide a \"fixed \nmeaning\" for the term \"unitary.\" Freeman v. Pittst 503 U.S. 467t 487 \n(1992). Howevert in light of the aim of Brown I, which was \"the elim \nination of atafe-mandated or deliberately maintained dual school sys \nn, \ntems,\" Milliken-v. BradleYt 418 U.S. 717, 737 (1974) (Milliken  a \nschool system must be declared unitary when it no longer discrimi \nnates between children on the basis of race, see Green, 391 U.S. at \n442. The burden of proof falls on the party seeking an end to court \nsupervision. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494. \nIn undertaking a unitary status inquiry, a court must ask \"whether \nthe Board hats) complied in good faith with the desegregation decree \nsince it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination \nhalve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Board of Educ. v. \nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-SO (1991). Implicit in the Supreme Court's \nuse of the term \"practicable\" is \"a reasonable limit on the duration of \n... federal supervision. \" Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. \nof Educ., 90 F.3d 752,760 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Dowell, 498 U.S. \nat 247 (\"From the very ftrst, federal supervision of local school sys \ntems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimina \ntion. H). Hence, the goals of a desegregation order not only encompass \na remedy for the violation, but also prompt restoration of local con \ntrol. See Freeman. S03 U.S. at 490 (\"Returning schools to the control \nof local authorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to \nrestore their true accountability in our govenunental system .... \n83 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 81 of 128\n\nWhere control lies, so too does responsibility. \"); Milliken 1,418 U.S. \nat 74142 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply \nrooted than local control over the operation of schools; local auton \nomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of com \nmunity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the \neducational process. \"). \nAmong the most important reference points in determining whether \na school board has fulfilled its duties so that local control may be \nresumed are the factors set out in Green: student assignment, faculty \nassignment, facilities and resources, transportation. staff assignment, \nand extracurricular activities. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435. In its dis \ncretion, a court conducting a unitary status hearing may consider \nother relevant factors not mentioned in Green. See Freeman, 503 U.S. \nat 492. I address the district court's consideration of each factor in \ntum, but only to determine whether \"the district court's account of the \nevidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety. \" \nAnderson. 470 U.S. at 573-74. \nA. Student Assi~~nt \nStudent assignment is perhaps the most critical Green factor \nbecause state-mandated separation of pupils on the basis of race is the \nessence of the dual system. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474 (observing \nthat the issue of student assignment is \"fundamental\" because \"under \nthe former de jure regimes racial exclusion was both the means and \nthe end of a policy motivated by disparagement of . . . the disfavored \nrace\"). To determine whether a school was racially balanced or imbal \nanced, the district court adopted a plus/minus fifteen percent variance \nfrom the district-wide ratio of black to white students. See Capacch \nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 246. However, the district court emphasized \n\"that there is no level of compliance with the standard that is detenni \nnative.\" Id. When schools are outside the variance, a \"reasonable and \nsupportable explanation[ ]\" will suffice. Id. \nThe plus/minus fifteen percent variance adopted by the district \ncourt was not clearly erroneous. Considering that the only variance \never approved by the district court in the course of the Swann litiga \ntion was a \"'plus 15%' from the district-wide average,\" y!.. at 245, the \naddition of a minus fifteen percent is reasonable. Moreover, the \n84 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 82 of 128\n\nSupreme Court has pennitted a \"limited use ... of mathematical \nratios\" by district courts, Swann, 402 U.S. at 25. and much higher \nvariances have been used to derme desegregation. See Adams v. Wein \n~, 391 F. Supp. 269, 271 (D.D.C. 1975) (using a plus/minus \ntwenty percent variance); see generally. David J. Armor, Forced Jus \ntice: School DeseKreeation and the Law 160 (1995) (observing that \nin over seventy percent of the school districts with desegregation \nplans where racial balance is measured by numerical standards, a \nvariance of plus/minus fifteen percent or greater is used).21n sum, the \nplus/minus fifteen percent variance is clearly within accepted stan \ndards, and provides a reasonable starting point in the unitary status \ndetermination. \n1. CMS's Compliance Record \nThe district court began by observing that since 1970, of the 126 \nschools in operation. \"only twenty schools (16%) have had black stu \ndent bodies higher than 15 % above the district-wide ratio for more \nthan three years, and only seventeen schools (13 %) have had black \nstudent bodies IGwer than 15% below the district-wide ratio for more \nthan three years.\"· Capacchione. 57 F. Supp. 2d at 248 (footnote omit \nted). In addition. the district court found that CMS has not operated \na single-race school since 1970. See id. \nThe district court also turned to two desegregation indices: the dis-\n2 At trial. Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified \nthat unitary status depended on every school being in balance. See I.A. \nXV-7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann. 402 U.S. at 24 (\"The \nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every \nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of \nthe school system as a whole. H). \nI find equally erroneous the ~ plaintiffs' assertion at appellate \nargument that \"[t]he issue of how many schools are balanced has never \nbeen a question in this case.\" App. Tr. 91. The racial composition of \nschools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, and is very much key \nto a review of the district court's declaration of unitary status. ~ \nSwann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (ordering CMS to assign pupils \"in such a \nway that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various grade \nlevels have about  same proportion of black and white students\"). \n~e \n85 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 83 of 128\n\nsimilarity index and the index of interracial exposure. The former \n\"measures the degree of racial imbalance, and it is derived by com \nparing the racial composition of each school to the districtwide com \nposition,\" I.A. xxxm-16,l72, and the latter measures the \"the \naverage percent white in schools attended by black students, weighted \nby the proportion of black students in each school.\" I.A. XXXill-\n16,172. According to the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert \nwitness, Dr. David I. Armor, a dissimilarity value of twenty or below \nsignifies \"a highly balanced school system\" and a score under thirty \nsignifies \"a substantially desegregated system.\" lA. XXXill-16,172. \nCMS's dissimilarity score was sixteen in 1980 and twenty-six in \n1995. From this it is clear that CMS quickly desegregated in the \n1970s ancJ. continues to maintain a \"substantially desegregated sys \ntem. \" The dissimilarity index also indicates that CMS bas better racial \nbalance than several comparable districts did when they were \ndeclared unitary. See lA. XXXill-16,173. \nThe index of interracial exposure, like the dissimilarity index, \nshows that.CMS has made great leaps of progress. A score of zero on \nthe exposure index signifies total segregation, while a score of fifty \nor above indicates'a \"highly desegregated system.\" I.A. XXXill-\n16,172. Schools in CMS typically score above fifty, whereas before \nthe desegregation order the schools' scores hovered near twenty or \nbelow. See lA. XXXill-16,194-96. \nCMS and the ~ plaintiffs correctly point out that the data sug \ngest that in recent years racial imbalance has increased in some \nschools. Aware of this trend, the district court made a number of fmd \nings on growth and demographic change in the Charlotte \nMecklenburg area. The most revealing findings are as follows: \n-the county population has increased from 354,656 in \n1970 to 6l3,310 in 1997 \n-in 1970 the school district was the forty-third largest in \nthe nation and is today the twenty-third largest \n-Among cities with more than 500,000 people, Charlotte \nranks second in population growth in the 1990s \n86 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 84 of 128\n\n-the racial composition of the county has changed from \nseventy-six percent white and twenty-four percent black \nin 1970 to sixty-eight percent white, twenty-seven per \ncent black, and five percent other in 1997 \n-the current racial composition of schoolchildren is fifty \npercent white, forty-two percent black, and eight percent \nother \n-as the county bas become more suburban the inner city \nand nearby suburbs have lost large numbers of white res \nidents as they spread farther out into the formerly rural \nsections of the county \n-some middle suburban communities that were once all \nwhite are now predominately black \n-the rural black population in the southern part of the \nC01)ll'Y bas remained relatively constant while the white \npopulatiop has tripled because of suburbanization \nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 236-39. These rmding are sup \nported by the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert in demograph \nics, Dr. William Clark. ~ J.A. XXXlli-16230-306. Accordingly, the \ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here can be no doubt that demography \nand geography have played the largest role in causing imbalance.\" \nC3Pacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250. \nTestimony from Dr. John Murphy, CMS's superintendent from \n1991 to 1995, corroborates the district court's conclusion. Dr. Murphy \ntestified that when he assumed his duties he \"was quite concerned \nabout the increasing difficulty in bringing about racial balance . . . \nbecause of the demographic shifts that were occurring.\" 1.A. VI-2712. \nPopulation growth translated into more automobiles on the road, mak \ning increased busing impracticable because \"the travel time to move \nyoungsters from the suburbs into the city with the flow of rush hour \ntraffic was a problem.\" J.A. VI-2732. In the fall of 1991, CMS hired \nDr. Michael 1. Stolee to examine the problem and offer solutions. Dr. \nStolee also concluded that CMS's task \"has been complicated by pop-\n87 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 85 of 128\n\nulation growth.\" lA. XXXU-15.571. and he recommended the adop \ntion of a magnet schools program, which CMS promptly \nimplemented. \nThe Supreme Court has dealt with similar population growth and \nshifting demographics in the context of unitary status. In Freeman, \nthe court unequivocally stated that \"racial imbalance ... [is] not tanta \nmount to a showing that the school district [is] in noncompliance with \nthe decree or with its duties under the law.\" 503 U.S. at 494. Brown \nI, of course, does not mandate that racial balance be pursued in perpe \ntuity. Once the original racial imbalance caused by a constitutional \nviolation has been rectified, \"the school district is under no duty to \nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors. \" Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 494. The  plaintiffs contend that consideration of \n~ \ndemographics and the rationale of Freeman are misplaced because the \ngrowth and shifting demographics of DeKalb County, Georgia, the \nschool district under court order in Freeman, exceeded that of \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg. While CMS's growth rates and demographic \nshifts certainly do not equal those experienced in DeKalb,3 I can fmd \nFreeman \nnothing in  limiting its holding to the specific facts of \nDeKalb County (Jr'establishing DeKalb as the standard for measuring \nimbalance caused by demographic factors. On the contrary, the opin \nion speaks in general terms. The Supreme Court observed that in the \nUnited States \"it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school \ndistricts, based as they are on political subdivisions such as counties \nand municipalities, may undergo rapid change.\" Id. at 495. Mobility, \nthe Court noted, \"is a distinct characteristic of our society.\" Id. at 494. \nFreeman cannot be distinguished into nothingness, nor does the stan \ndard of review permit this court to reweigh the evidence of the \nchanges in CMS. \nSimply put, the district court's conclusion that the current imbal \nance is unrelated to the original constitutional violation is not clearly \nerroneous. Evidence presented at trial indicated that \"[o]f the 16 for \nmer black schools that are still open, 13 are currently balanced and \n3 For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in \n1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students in the dis \ntrict grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 475. \n88 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 86 of 128\n\nhave been desegregated for periods ranging from 22 to 28 years. Of \nthe 3 that currently exceed the + 15% black variance, each has been \nbalanced for at least 22 years.\" lA. xxxm-16,176. Interestingly, of \nthe seventy-two former white schools that are still open, fifteen are \nnow majority black and were in balance for periods of twelve to \ntwenty-five years. See J.A. XXXIII-16,176. \nIn addition, Dr. Armor examined the seventeen schools in eMS \nthat exceeded the plus fifteen percent variance for three or more years \nduring the last decade. See lA. XXXIII-16,174-76.4 Sixteen of the \nseventeen were balanced for periods ranging from nineteen to twenty \nsix years, with one school experiencing balance for sixteen years. To \nthe extent that eMS's pupil reassignments could be assessed, Dr. \nArmor concluded that changes instituted by eMS were .. attempts to \nmaintain or restore racial balance in the face of overwhelming demo \ngraphic growth and mobility.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Indeed, Dr. \nArmor concluded that imbalance had been reduced in several of the \nschools because eMS's magnet program attracted white students \nfrom the Ol.itet reaches of the county. \nLong periods of atmost perfect compliance with the court's racial \nbalance guidelines,S coupled with some imbalance in the wake of \n4 Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this \nanalysis on three.grounds: \n(1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black \nenrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have bad low black \nenrollment for the past three or more years and that were operat \ning in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,] \nand (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these \nschools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced \nbecause of the substantial white enrollment growth in the out \nskirts of the county. \nJ.A. XXXm-16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26 \n(observing \"that the existence of some small number of one-race, or vir \ntually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark \nof a system that still practices segregation by law\"). \nS Even the  plaintiffs admit that ten years after the district court \n~ \ncharged the board with taking affirmative steps to desegregate schools, \nthe system \"w[as] nearly 100% statistically compliant with the court's \norders ...

See Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 495 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action \nbut of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. \"). \nThe evidence presented at trial adequately explained why a few \nschools have become imbalanced, and I can discern no evidence or \nomissions that indicate clear error has been committed in this regard. \n90 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 88 of 128\n\nVolume 3 of3 \n91 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 89 of 128\n\n2. Martin and Unitary Status \nThe Swann plaintiffs also point to school sitings, transportation \nburdens, and school transfers as evidence that the growing imbalance \nis caused by state action rather than private choices, and that CMS has \nnot complied with the district court's orders in good faith. In advanc \ning their argument, the Swann plaintiffs rely chiefly on Martin v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 475 F. Supp. 1318 \n(W.O.N.C. 1979), in which a group of parents sought to enjoin CMS \nfrom reassigning over 4000 students in order to maintain racial bal \nance in certain schools. The plaintiffs in Mm based their position \non Pasadena City Board of EdUcation v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 \n(1976), and Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. \n265 (1978). In the former case, the Supreme Court reaffinned that \ndistrict courts could not order a school district \"to rearrange its atten \ndance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by \nthe court was maintained in perpetuity,\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436, \nand in the latter the Court struck down a medical school admissions \npolicy that ,reserved sixteen of one hundred seats in the entering class \nfor applicants w~o were '\"  economically and/or educationally disad \nvantaged'\" and who were members of certain minority groups. Bakke, \n438 U.S. at 274. The district court in Martin distinguished Spangler \nby observing that it was but a restatement of the Swann Court's admo \nnition about the use of racial quotas and that, unlike Pasadena City. \nCMS had not achieved racially neutral attendance patterns. See Mar \ntin, 475 F. Supp. at 1340. As for the Bakke decision, the district court \npointed out that no student in CMS was denied \"an equal educational \n92 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 90 of 128\n\nopportunity\" and that the admissions policy in ~ was imple \nmented \"against a backdrop devoid of specific judicial findings or \nadministrative acknowledgments of the prior segregated status of the \nschool system. \" Id. at 1345. Accordingly, the MII:tiD court concluded \nthat CMS's reassignment of students was \"within constitutional limits \nand should be upheld.\" Id. at 1321. The district court took pains to \nensure that its opinion would not be interpreted too broadly: \"This \norder simply upholds the actions of the 1978 Board against the attacks \nby the plaintiffs.\" .kL. at 1347. In the course of the Martin opinion, the \ndistrict court observed that CMS had fallen short in four areas: con \nstruction and location of facilities in parts of the county likely to \nenhance desegregation, placement of elementary and kindergarten \ngrades in schools throughout the county, monitoring of student trans \nfers so as to prevent resegregation, and allocation of the burdens of \nbusing. See id. at 1328-29. However. the district court also noted that \nCMS bad made great progress and that a return to the old system of \nsegregation \"has not tempted the present Scbool Board, wbo are \nstanding fast in their endeavor to run the schools according to law \nwbile provjding quality education.\" Id. at 1347. \nIn Capacchione~ -the district court correctly observed that \"Martin \nwas not a unitary status bearing,\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250, \nand that because \"the desegregation plan was still in its fledgling \nstages, the Court was inclined to keep the pressure on CMS,\" id. at \n251. The Capaccbione court further observed that post-Manin \nchanges in Charlotte-Mecklenburg counseled looking at the \"concerns \n[of Martin] in a new light.\" Id. The district court's interpretation of \n.M!tti!l is reasonable and in accord with the rule in this circuit that a \ndistrict court, as a continuous institution, is\"best able to interpret its \nown orders.\" Vauahns v. Board of FAuc., 758 F.2d 983,989 (4th Cir. \n1985) (scbool desegregation case). Moreover, the Martin order was \nissued thirteen years before the Supreme Court made clear in Free \n.m!m that the affirmative measures mandated by Green are not meant \nto remedy \"private choices\" that lead to resegregation. Freeman, 503 \nU.S. at 495. The state of the law and the understanding of duties upon \nscbool districts were far different when Martin was handed down. \nHence, a number of assertions in Martin cannot be squared with the \npresent state of the law. See. e.g., Martin 475 F. Supp. at 1346 (stating \nthat segregated housing patterns must necessarily lead to the unconsti \ntutional segregation of scbools). Ignoring the changes in Cbarlotte-\n93 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 91 of 128\n\nMecklenburg and in the law by erecting Martin as the framework for \nunitary status, as the Swann plaintiffs urged below, would defy com \nmon sense and run afoul of developments in the Supreme Court's \nschool desegregation jurisprudence. See United States Gy'psum Co. v. \nSchiavo Bros., 668 F.2d 172, 176 (3d Cit. 1981) (concluding that a \nsuccessor judge \"is empowered to reconsider [the legal conclusions of \nan unavailable predecessor] to the same extent that his or her pre \ndecessor could have\"). I will examine the district court's Martin find \nings in tum. \na. School Siting \nThe district court found that CMS had not shirked its duties under \nthe law with regard to school sitings. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. \n2d at 251-53. The record reveals that CMS has, to the extent practica \nble, continually endeavored to site schools in order to foster integra \ntion, and has adopted a policy of building schools in areas equally \naccessible to blacks and whites. Testimony of current board members \nindicated tttat,in efforts to fulfill this policy, eMS has purchased \nproperty in low growth areas for school construction even though \nschools in predoifiioantly white high growth areas were overcrowded. \nSee lA. V-1986-87. In 1992 eMS reaffirmed its siting policy and \nresolved that, \"whenever possible, \" new schools would be built in \nareas that would \"provide black student enrollment of not less than 10 \npercent from the census tracts serving the new school.\" I.A. XXXII-\n15,686. The impetus behind the resolution was growth in the periph \nery of the county which the board speculated would continue patterns \nof housing segregation. thus making it more difficult to maintain \nracial balance in the schools. Evidence presented at trial indicated that \nthe ten percent rule was destined for failure because it was not possi \nble to implement the rule and still \"meet the 6O-minute bus ride \nlimit.\" I.A. XXII-I0,869. Nevertheless, extensive evidence was pres \nented showing that CMS never sited schools in order to foster segre \ngation and that \"every effort was made to try to fmd school sites that \nwould bring people together in balanced numbers.\" I.A. VI-27S2. For \nexample, eMS's executive director of planning and student place \nment testified that in siting schools eMS \"looked at both African \nAmerican and all populations not only in the vicinity of the site, but \nin the entire district.\" I.A. VII-2920. So dedicated was eMS to siting \nschools in integrated areas that it contemplated refusing a gift of land \n94 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 92 of 128\n\nfor school use because the land was in a predominantly white area. \nlA. V-1985. \n~ \nFaced with growth in the predominantly white regions of the far \nsouth and north, ~ lA. XXXIll-16,261, CMS was compelled to \nserve populations in those areas via school sitings. CMS' s data show \nthat in the late 19905, student population was  growing at nearly \nn \n4,000 students per year,\" lA. XXIX-14,133, and consequently the \nboard was \"just trying to keep up\" with the population explosion in \nbuilding schools, J.A. V-2249. Overcrowding was a problem, and in \nthe late 19908 \"the average high school expected to operate at 109 \npercent of its capacity.  J .A. XXIX-14,133. Even though CMS was \nn \nforced to build schools at a rapid rate to serve an expanding student \npopulation, pupil assignment plans in which eMS described popula \ntion growth as a \"major consideration[]\" are replete with efforts to \nimprove racial balance. I.A. XXIX-14,133. For example, the 1997-98 \nassignment plan highlighted the creation and expansion of several \nmagnet programs specially designed to reduce the black ratio in' a \nnumber of:sChools. See lA. XXIX-14,147-51. To the extent practica \nble, CMS did no! ,sacrifice racial balance concerns to population \ngrowth. Though the two often pulled CMS in different directions, the \nrecord indicates that the board coordinated racial balance and school \nsitings as best it could under the circumstances. The evidence does \nnot indicate that the abandonment of the ten percent rule or other \ndecisions regarding school siting were the result of a desire to perpet \nuate the dual school system or circumvent the district court's orders. \nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs, citing to prior orders, contend that \nthe board bas not done all that it could do in the area of school siting. \nErection of such a standard, however. would effectively replace prac \nticability with possibility. The former implies measures that can be \nreasonably implemented under the circumstances, while the latter \nomits the reasonableness requirement. For instance, it was possible \nfor CMS to adhere to the ten percent rule while ignoring growth in \nthe far north and south of the county. Youngsters would have been \ncompelled to ride buses for long periods while traveling with the flow \nof rush hour traffic, but it was nonetheless possible to adhere to the \nten percent rule. Of course, the practicability of a refusal to respond \nto growth in Charlotte-Mecklenburg is another matter. \n95 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 93 of 128\n\nIn the same vein, the Swann plaintiffs contend that school siting \ndecisions were a response to white flight, which is an impennissible \nreason for failing to comply with a desegregation order. Growth, of \ncourse, is far different from flight. And experts offered evidence of \n\"the economic boom in the Charlotte Metropolitan area in the last \ndecade.\" I.A. XXXlll-16,233. Charlotte-Mecldenburg is one of the \nmost dynamic areas in the South; it is far different from the Charlotte \nMecldenburg of Swann, and much changed from that of Mmlin. In \nlight of the growth in the county and a plethora of evidence demon \nstrating that the board used its best efforts to site schools in order to \nfoster integration, the district court did not conunit error when it con \ncluded that there is no \"continuing constitutional violation[ ] in the \narea of school siting.\" Caoacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253. \nb. Burdens of Busing \nAs for the burdens of busing, the district court found that in the \nmost recent school year, 15,533 black students and 11,184 non-black \nstudents WCrt} bused for balancing purposes. Id. As stated earlier, traf \nfic patterns mak~ busing suburban students into the inner city far \nmore difficult dian busing inner-city children into the suburbs. ~ \nI.A. VI-2732; I.A. V-2228. Though a disproportionate number of \nAfrican-American students are bused, the growth and housing pat \nterns support the district court's conclusion that the realities of the \ncurrent situation should not block a unitary status determination. \nc. Student Transfers \nFinally, Martin S concern with student transfers appears to have \nI \nbeen based on the assumption that CMS would experience average \ngrowth. Courts are not omniscient, and the district court in 1979 could \nnot have foreseen the changing demographics that would make stu \ndent transfers the least of CMS's worries. In the present litigation, the \ndistrict court observed \"that CMS 'kept an eye on [magnet transfers] \nso that there wouldn't be a run on the bank so to speak from anyone \nschool. '\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250 n.lO (alteration in origi \nnal). This finding is not clearly erroneous, nor can I discern the need \nfor more findings on this issue in light of post-Martin changes. \n96 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 94 of 128\n\n3. Conclusion \nIn sum, the district court's findings on student assignment are \n\"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.  Anderson, 470 \nIt \nU.S. at 573. The dual system of student assignment in CMS has been \neradicated \"to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. The \nimbalance existing in some schools is not traceable to the fonner dual \nsystem or to renewed discriminatory actions, but rather is a result of \ngrowth and shifting demographics. Consequently, I would hold that \nthe district court's findings on student assignment are not clearly erro \nneous. \nB. Faculty Assignment \nIn examining faculty assignment, the district again used a \nplus/minus fifteen percent variance. Of the 126 schools operating in \nCMS, the district court found that in 1997-98 only ten schools were \nout of balance. The Swann plaintiffs point out that this number grew \nto sixteen in 1\"998-99, but this means that a mere twelve percent of \nthe schools wer~ out of balance. This is a far cry from the dual system \nin which \"most of the 24,000 [black students] ha[d] no white teach \ners.\" Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360. There is simply no evidence that \nCMS assigns black teachers to predominantly black schools and white \nteachers to predominantly white schools. Thus, like the majority, I \nbelieve that the district court's conclusion that this Green factor has \nbeen satisfied is not clearly erroneous. \nC. Facilities and Resources \nThe Swann plaintiffs and CMS contend that the district court \nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this factor. The majority \nagrees with this argument, concluding that the improper allocation of \nthe burden of proof amounts to an error of law and that this issue \ntherefore must be remanded to the district court. I respectfully dis \nagree. \nThis court has previously made clear that \"once a court has found \nan unlawful dual school system, [those alleging the existence of racial \ndisparities] are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are \n97 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 95 of 128\n--------\n_._._ \n.  ....• \n\ncausally related to prior segregation, and the burden of proving other \nwise rests on the defendants. \" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v. \nBaliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). In this case, however, \nthe district court noted that none of the prior orders entered in the \nlong history of the Swann litigation had ever found racial disparities \nto exist with regard to school facilities and concluded that CMS and \nthe Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing discrimination \nwith regard to facilities. See Capacchione. 57 F. Supp. 2d at 263 (\"[I]t \nwould defy logic to place now the burden of proof on the Plaintiff \nIntervenors, requiring them to prove that vestiges of discrimination in \nfacilities have been remedied, when the Court originally found no \nvestiges to exist. \"). In my view, this erroneous assignment of the bur \nden of proof, which did not affect the manner in which the parties \ntried the case or otherwise prejudice their rights, is harmless and does \nnot undermine the district court's factual conclusions regarding the \nfacilities factor.6 \nImmediately after assigning the burden to CMS and the Swann \nplaintiffs,  court's order nonetheless summarized and \n~e4istrict \nweighed the facilities evidence presented by the parties. The district \ncourt carefully analyzed the testimony and report of Dr. Dwayne \nGardner, an expert witness for CMS. Dr. Gardner analyzed seventy \nthree schools--every identifiably black school in CMS and a sam \npling of balanced schools and predominantly white schools. Dr. Gard \nner measured the adequacy, safety, healthfulness, accessibility, \nflexibility, efficiency, expansibility, and appearance of the schools. \nBased on the inspection he grouped schools as follows: \"044 (sug \ngests replacement), 45-59 (needs major improvement), 60-74 (needs \nminor improvement), 75-89 (serves program needs), and 90-100 \n(exceptional quality).\" Id. at 264. The survey revealed that of the four \nschools that warranted replacement, two were majority white, and two \nwere imbalanced black. See I.A. XXV-12,182-86. Thirty-four schools \n6 Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it \ncould be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set forth in \nBaliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required \nto prove the existence of racial disparity in its facilities. See United \nStates v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d 301,309-11 (2d Cir. 1999), vacated \non reh'g, 197 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1999). \n98 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 96 of 128\n\nfell into the \"needs major improvement\" category, of which sixteen \nwere imbalanced black and eighteen identifiably white. \nThe district court determined that Dr. Gardner's testimony estab \nlished that any current disparities were functions of the age of the \nfacilities at issue, because \ndifferent building standards apply when a new facility is \nconstructed as compared to when an older facility is renD \nvated or upgraded. In other words, the renovation of an \nolder facility usually complies with the code under which \nthe facility was built. Because most facilities in the predomi \nnately black inner city are older while facilities in the pre \ndominately white suburbs are newer, the inference is that \ndifferences in building standards tend to affect black stu \ndents disproportionately. This does not amount to racial dis \ncrimination. Indeed, this practice applies regardless of the \nracial composition of the school. Thus, older schools that \nare'predominately white-several of which were built in the \n1920s--~ likewise affected by this practice. \nCapacchione, 57 F. SUpp. 2d at 265 (footnote and transcript refer \nences omitted). Thus, the district court concluded from Dr. Gardner's \ntestimony and report \"that CMS's facilities needs are spread across \nthe system without regard to the racial composition of its schools.\" Id. \nThe district court also considered the testimony of CMS's assistant \nsuperintendent of building services, who testified that out of 108 \nschools in need of renovations, eighty-Dne percent were racially bal \nanced or identifiably white. See J.A. VIII-3810 & 3818. The district \ncourt concluded that this witness's testimony likewise demonstrated \nthat the deficiencies in CMS's facilities were unrelated to the former \nde jure system. \nFinally, the court considered CMS' s track record in renovating old \nfacilities, praising its practice of allocating funds on a per-pupil basis \nand noting that \"CMS has spent a large portion oflits] bond money \non improving schools in predominantly black areas. \" Capacchione, \n57 F. SUpp. 2d at 266. \n99 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 97 of 128\n\nAfter an extensive discussion of this evidence, the court made the \nfollowing finding of fact with regard to facilities: \nJust as Judge McMillan found thirty years ago, the Court \nfinds today that inequities in facilities exist throughout the \nsystem regardless of the racial makeup of the school. These \ndisparities are generally the result of the relative ages of the \nfacilities, combined with an ongoing lack of funding and the \nneed to accommodate unprecedented growth. \nThis finding is. clearly determinative of the question of unitary sta \ntus as to facilities, regardless of which party carried the burden of \nproof. That is, the district court, after carefully considering and \nweighing all the evidence presented on this factor, concluded that any \ndisparity as to the condition of the facilities that might exist was not \ncaused by any intentional discrimination by CMS, but instead was a \nfunction of JIlt: age and location of the facilities and the ever-present \nproblem of allocating all too scarce funds. Even if the district court \nhad assigned the ~lkirden of proof to the plaintiff-intervenors, this fac \ntual finding would have compelled a ruling in their favor. In fact, the \ndistrict court acknowledged as much, stating \"that the Plaintiff \nIntervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent \nand causation.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 n.38.7 \nTherefore, because the district court's findings, which were based \non the court's weighing of all of the relevant evidence presented at \n7 From this footnote and the district court's detailed discussion about \nthe cause of any disparity in CMS's facilities, it appears that the district \ncourt really made alternative rulings on the facilities question: The court \nfirst concluded that CMS and the Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of \nproof with regard to facilities and that they failed to carry that burden. \nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 (\"[Ilhe Swann Plaintiffs have \nfailed to overcome the Court's previous findings on facilities by estab \nlishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causation. H). The court \nthen ruled in the alternative, as indicated by the footnote and the fmd \nings, that the plaintiff-intervenors proved that any disparities were the \nresult of factors unrelated to state action. \n100 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 98 of 128\n\ntrial, would have yielded the same conclusion under a proper assign \nment of the burden of proof, any error with regard to the burden of \nproof is harmless. See Washington State Pep' t of Transp. v. Washing \nton Natural Gas Co., 59 F.3d 793, 801 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding dis \ntrict court's improper assignment of the burden of proof to be \nharmless because review of the entire record established \"that under \nthe proper assignment of the burden of proof, the district court would \nhave reached the same decision\"); Applewood Landscape & Nursery \nCo. v. HoUinesworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1506 (1st Cir. 1989) (conclud \ning that, if the district court improperly allocated burden of proof on \na particular issue, the error was harmless because the district court's \ndecision on that issue turned on the weight of the evidence in the \nrecord and not on burden of proof rules); cf. Vau'lhns, 758 F.2d at 992 \n(recognizing that an error in shifting the burden of proof in a school \ndesegregation case may be harmless if the record is such that the court \ncan conclude that substantial rights have not been prejudiced). \nBecause any error associated with the burden of proof is hannless, \nthe only question that remains is whether the district court's factual \nfindings about the facilities are clearly erroneous. Contrary to the \nmajority's analysis of Dr. Gardner's report and its discussion of \"an \necdotal accounts of a number of witnesses,\" ante at 40, I simply can \nnot conclude that the data and other evidence in the record show the \ndistrict court's findings on this Green factor to be implausible. See \nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 574. The majority is certainly correct that \"lies, \ndamned lies, and statistics\" are subject to \"selective culling\" and can \nsupport varying interpretations of the evidence. Ante at 39-40 n.14. \nThe briefs of the parties make this obvious. Though the evidence \ncould have been weighed differently on this factor. \"[ w] here there are \ntwo permissible views of the evidence, the factfmder's choice \nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson, 470 U.S. at \n574. In 1969, the district court found that there was no constitutional \nviolation in the \"quality of school buildings and facilities.\" Swann, \n300 F. Supp. at 1372. The Ccmacchione court found that this remains \ntrue today. and the evidence as a whole indicates that this rmding is \nnot clearly erroneous. \nD. Transportation \nThe parties do not dispute the district court's finding that \"CMS \nprovides free bus transportation to all students who do not live within \n101 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 99 of 128\n\na mile and a half of their schools.\" Capacchione. 57 F. Supp. 2d at \n267. The focus of the Swann plaintiffs' argument on this factor deals \nwith the Martin opinion. As previously discussed, Martin does not \nprovide the framework for a unitary status detennination and the dis \ntrict court's interpretation of Martin, along with the finding that the \npresent state of busing \"may be about the best CMS can do, \" Capac \nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253, does not constitute error. \nE. Staff Assignment \nThe district court, noting that fmdings of discrimination in school \nstaffing were never made, concluded that CMS has complied with its \nconstitutional duties. The parties point this court to no contrary evi \ndence, nor have I discovered such in the record. Therefore, I concur \nwith the majority that the district court's fmdings regarding the fifth \nfactor are not clearly erroneous. \n~ \nF. Extracurricular Activities \n.. \n' \nThe district court concluded that there was no discrimination or \nvestiges of discrimination with regard to extracurricular activities. \nThe evidence presented at trial showed that the ratios of blacks and \nwhites participating in extracurricular activities, though varying \nsomewhat from year to year, is approximately equal. See I.A. XXIV-\n11,634. Areas where there are disparities were not shown to be linked \nto the former dual system. For example, blacks often outnumber \nwhites in holding elective offices in student government, but whites \nhave a higher level of representation in honors programs. No evidence \nis found in the record to indicate that CMS somehow pushes African \nAmericans toward student government and away from honors pro \ngrams. In sum, I agree with the majority that the district court's con \nclusion that CMS has satisfied this Green factor is not clearly \nerroneous. \nG. Ancillary Factors \n1. Teacher Quality \nThe district court found that there was no discrimination in the \nquality of teaching. The Swann plaintiffs contend this finding is \n102 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 100 of 128\n\nclearly erroneous because students in imbalanced African-American \nschools are more likely to have inexperienced teachers. This \"experi \nence gap, \" to the extent it exists. is minuscule. The district court \nfound that \"teachers in imbalanced-black schools had 0.7 to 1.3 fewer \nyears experience than the district averages and had 1.6 to 2.9 fewer \nyears experience than teachers in imbalanced-white schools. \" Capac \nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. To use middle school teachers as an \nexample, the statistics reveal that the average middle school teacher \nin an imbalanced African-American school had 8.2 years experience \nversus 9.8 years for his counterpart in an imbalanced white school. Id. \nThese numbers clearly support a finding of equality rather than dis \nparity. and cannot undermine the district court's conclusion on this \nfactor. The district court also pointed to evidence indicating that expe \nrience does not necessarily relate to competency. For example, \naccording to former Superintendent Murphy, it is not uncommon to \nhave \"excellent frrst-year teachers\" and \"very weak 35th-year teach \ners.\" lA. VI-2795. Other witnesses observed that the newer teachers \nhad better \"knowledge of various teaching strategies\" and were more \ncomfortable with diverse classrooms. I.A. VII-3275. \nThe Swann plaintiffs also assert that imbalanced African-American \nschools have fewer teachers with advanced degrees. For instance, in \nimbalanced black high schools only thirty-one percent of the teachers \nheld advanced degrees, while forty-six percent of the teachers in \nimbalanced white high schools held advanced degrees. See Capacch \ni2wc., 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. As it was with teacher experience, testi \nmony was offered establishing that the number of degrees a teacher \npossesses does not necessarily translate into competence or quality \ninstruction. ~ I.A. VII-3276. According to former Superintendent \nMurphy, \"the degree level was not a significant indicator of getting \nbetter performance on the part of the teacher.\" lA. VI-2795. Expert \nreports submitted by the plaintiff-intervenors also indicated that there \nis \"no significant relationship\" between black achievement and \nteacher education levels. I.A. XXXm-16,221. In sum, I agree with \nthe majority that the district court's conclusion that African-American \nstudents receive equal access to quality teachers is not clearly errone \nous. \n2. Student Achievement \nThe district court found that the existence of an achievement gap \nbetween black and .white students was not a vestige of the dual system \n103 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 101 of 128\n\nor evidence of discrimination in the current operation of CMS. This \nwas an area of immense disagreement at trial, and the parties \npresented a mountain of data on this subject. Though the Fourteenth \nAmendment guarantees equal protection but not equal outcomes, if \nlow African-American achievement is a result of the former de jure \nsystem, it must be eliminated to the extent practicable. See Dowell, \n498 U.S. at 249-50. Conversely, to the extent that low achievement \nis linked to other factors, it is beyond the reach of the court's author \nity. Most courts of appeals confronting this issue, including this court, \nhave declined to consider the achievement gap as a vestige of dis \ncrimination or as evidence of current discrimination. See Baliles, 829 \nF.2d at 1313 (upholding lower court's findings that low achievement \nis \"primarily attributable to the high incidence of poverty\" in the \nschool district); see also, United States v. City of Yonkers. 197 F.3d \n41.54 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that \"using achievement test scores \nas a measure, either direct or indirect. of a school system's movement \naway from segregation is deeply problematic\"); People Who Care v. \nRockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997) (explaining \nthat a number-of variables, other than discrimination, account for the \nachievement gap); Coalition to Save Our Children, 90 F. 3d at 778 \n(finding \"a causal link between ... socioeconomic factors and student \nachievement\") . \nThe plaintiff-intervenors' expert witness, Dr. Armor, presented evi \ndence indicating that there is no correlation between African \nAmerican performance and the racial balance of schools. See I.A. \nXXXIII-16,178. For example, Dr. Armor's studies showed that \nAfrican-American students in the third through fifth grades attending \nschools sixteen to twenty-five percent African-American scored the \nsame on standardized tests as their counterparts in schools seventy \nfive percent black or greater. See I.A. at 16,214. Similarly, African \nAmerican students in the sixth through eighth grades attending \nschools sixteen percent black or less scored the same on standardized \ntests as their counterparts in schools seventy-five percent black or \ngreater. See I.A. XXXIII-16,215. \nIn order to shed light on the true causes of the achievement gap, \nDr. Armor turned to socioeconomic factors. The data revealed star \ntling differences between black and white children in CMS. \n104 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 102 of 128\n\nAverage black family income is $31,000 compared to \n$59,000 for whites, and ooly 15 [percent] of black parents \nare college graduates, compared to 58 percent for white par \nents. A huge poverty gap is also revealed, with 63 percent \nof black students on free lunch compared to ooly 9 percent \nof white students. Finally, 83 percent of white students have \nboth parents at home, compared to only 42 percent for black \nstudents. \nJ.A. XXXID-16,179. According to Dr. Armor, the socioeconomic fac \ntors plus the second grade scores, which are the earliest available, \nexplain \"nearly 80 percent of the reading gap and over 70 percent of \nthe math gap.\" J.A. xxxm-16,180. Fonner Superintendent Murphy \nalso testified that in his experience \"[p Joor students come behind and \nstay that way. And in Charlotte, a majority of poor students happen \nto be African-American.\" J.A. VI-2696. Dan Saltrick, fonner assistant \nsuperintendent for instructional services, also testified that in his \nexperience low student test scores related to parental support which \nin tum waf \"-8 matter of ... socioeconomic levels.\" lA. VII-3280. \nWhile socioeco!1OlIlic disparities between black and white pupils are \ntroubling, they are not the result of CMS' s actions or inactions and \ntherefore are beyond the scope of the original desegregation order. \nSee Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1314 (\"Educational deficiencies that result \nfrom problems such as poverty are best remedied by programs \ndirected toward eliminating poverty, not by indirect solutions through \nschool programs. \").8 Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err \nin finding that the achievement gap between black and white students \nis not a vestige of past discrimination or evidence of present discrimi \nnation. \n8 Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors out-\nside CMS's control, the district court found that CMS has undertaken \nsundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted finan \ncial incentives for teachers and principals tied to student performance, \nurged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level \nclasses, challenged all students by removing \"fluff courses\" from the cur \nriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate \nstudent preparedness, and adopted pre-kindergarten programs to acceler \nate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F. \nSupp. 2d at 273-275. \n105 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 103 of 128\n\n3. Student Discipline \nThe district court found  that any disparities that exist in the area \nII \nof discipline are not causally related to the dual system. \" Ca.pacch \nione 57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. In none of the court's prior orders is there \nt \nany indication that CMS has ever discriminated in meting out punish \nment for disruptive students. However, recent statistics show that of \nthe 13,206 students disciplined from 1996-98, sixty-six percent were \nAfrican-American.  J.A. XXN -11,637. As the district court noted, \n~ \n\"disparity does not, by itself constitute discrimination.\" Capacchione, \nt \n57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. The idea that CMS should have a disciplinary \nquota is patently absurd, and there is no evidence in the record that \nCMS targets African-American students for discipline. Instead, the \nevidence indicates that CMS has adopted guidelines whereby students \nreceive the same level of punishment for certain offenses to ensure \nthat the amount of punishment will not vary from school to school. \nA student charged with a disciplinary infraction may also appeal the \ncharge \"and may assert that the charge was due to racial bias.\" Id. \nThere is simply no evidence in the record that CMS treats African \nAmerican students differently in disciplinary matters. Hence, the dis \ntrict court's concTusion that the disciplinary disparities are unrelated \nto the former de jure system is not clearly erroneous. \nH. Good Faith \nLastly, the district court found that eMS has complied with the \ndesegregation decree in good faith. See Freeman 503 U.S. at 491 \nt \n(requiring school board \"to demonstrate its good-faith commitment to \na constitutional course of action\"). Seven factors supported the district \ncourt's good-faith finding: (1) no further relief has been sought since \nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975; (2) \nCMS has gone above and beyond the court's orders by continually \nstriving to achieve balance even when the imbalance was uncon \nnected to the dual system; (3) the board has been open to community \ninput and sought community support for its integrative efforts; (4) the \nboard has repeatedly reaffumed its commitment to desegregation \nthrough various resolutions; (5) African-Americans currently occupy \nfour of the nine seats on the school board, including the chair; (6) the \nboard's actions over the past thirty years do not evince discriminatory \nmotives; and (1) \"no evidence has been presented that school authori-\n106 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 104 of 128\n\nties were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" Capacchione, 57 F. \nSupp. 2d at 282-83. \nTestimony from fonner board members indicated that the court's \norder has been \"institutionalized,\" lA. V-2222, and that the board \"al \nways stuck to what the rules were.\" lA. V-2234. Former Superinten \ndent Murphy testified that when he arrived in Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nhe found a \"unique\" environment where \"everybody wanted to make \nsure that their schools were racially balanced. \" lA. VI-2686. In 1992, \nDr. Stolee suggested a magnet plan to increase integration, and, in the \ncourse of his recommendations, observed that \"[flor the last twenty \nyears, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education and the \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg community have, in good faith. complied \nwith the orders of the court.\" J.A. XXXn-15.570. He further observed \n\"that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board and community have a great \ndea1 of pride in the fact that they successfully met a challenge and \nmade the solution work.\" J.A. XXXll-15,571. \nOf course/both in the district court and in appellate arguments, \ncurrent CMS o«:~ials engaged in much self-recrimination, described \nby the majority as \"frank acquiescence in a position inuring to [their] \ndetriment.\" Ante at 34. The district court gave little weight to CMS's \nassertions that the board had not put forth enough effort. and the evi \ndence presented at trial amply supports the district court in this \nregard. Former Superintendent Murphy testified that despite a report \nindicating that CMS was unitary and his belief that CMS \"w[as] defi \nnitely in compliance.\" no effort was made to dissolve the court order. \nJ.A. VI-2706. Dr. Murphy gave three reasons for the avoidance of a \nunitary status hearing. First, he advised board members that the court \nhearing would be \"a long, drawn-out process which would cost mil \nlions of dollars, and that would be money taken away from the \ninstructional program.\" J.A. VI-2706. Second, Dr. Murphy feared that \nif CMS was declared unitary \"we would not be eligible for federal \nfunding for our magnet schools.\" lA. VI-2706. Finally, Dr. Murphy \nthought it best to remain under court order so CMS could continue to \nracially balance schools even though the de jure violation had been \nremedied. \nDr. Susan Purser, the current associate superintendent of education \nservices of CMS, expressed a similar desire for CMS to remain under \n107 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 105 of 128\n\ncourt order. Though Dr. Purser testified that she believed that the \nschool board. superintendent. and administration were dedicated to \nenhancing educational opportunities for all of CMS's students regard \nless of race, she nonetheless expressed a preference for court supervi \nsion. Dr. Purser pointed out that the current \"Board has only a limited \ntime, because these are elected positions,\" I.A. XVO-S076, and that \nover time \"superintendents will change, [and) the people involved in \n[CMS] will change.\" lA. XVII-S077. At this point in the cross exam \nination. counsel asked Dr. Purser: \"But you don't know what any \nfuture School Board or administration will do either way, do you?\" \nI.A. XVII-S077. Dr. Purser responded: \"That's exactly my point. \" \nI.A. XVO-S077. Dr. Purser's testimony and that of Dr. Murphyexem \nplify why the Supreme Court has stressed that \"federal supervision of \nlocal school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy \npast discrimination.\" Dowell, 49S U.S. at 247; see also Coalition to \nSave Our Children, 90 F.3d at 761 n.6 (warning of \"the potential for \nthe entrenchment of [a] putatively transitional desegregation \nscheme\"). The district court's desegregation order was not intended \nto continue.after CMS remedied the de jure violation, nor was it \nintended to sus~nd the democratic process with no prospect of resto \nhaS \nration. Yet it  been institutionalized to the point that CMS officials \ncannot imagine life without it. Contrary to assertions of the majority, \nthe desegregation order is certainly not viewed as \"detrimental\" by \nCMS officials. See ante at 34. \nIronically, CMS' s clinging to the temporary desegregation order \nbuttresses the district court's finding that it is unlikely \"CMS would \nreturn to an intentionally-segregative system.\" Capacchione, 57 F. \nSupp. at 284. If CMS will go to such lengths to keep the court's order \nin place so that it may continue racial balancing and other policies, \nit is unthinkable that CMS will attempt to revive the dual system. \nAccordingly, the district judge's finding of good faith is not clearly \nerroneous. \nI. eMS's Remedial Plan \nAs a response to the plaintiff-intervenors' push for unitary status, \nCMS developed a remedial plan addressing many of the Green factors \nand other ancillary factors. ~ J.A. XXIII-ll,028. The district court \ndismissed the remedial plan as a '\"  litigation strategy' plan\" and \n108 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 106 of 128\n\ndeclined to consider it. Ccwacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 256. The \nmajority, in reversing the unitary status determination, describes the \ndistrict court's treatment of the remedial plan as\"a fundamental flaw \nin the district court's proceedings.\" Ante at 24. First, the majority \navers that the district court misconstrued the test for unitary status. \nAccording to the majority, a district court must ask (1) what a school \ndistrict has done in the past, and (2) what a school district may do in \nante \nthe future. See  at 25. Because the district court allegedly failed \nto undertake the latter inquiry as to the remedial plan. the majority \nholds that the district court's order must be reversed. The majority \ndivines its two-part test from Supreme Court cases which have \ninstructed district courts to ask \"whether the Board hats] complied in \ngood faith with the desegregation decree· since it was entered, and \nwhether the vestiges of past discrimination halve] been eliminated to \nthe extent practicable. \" Dowell, 498 U. S. at 249~50; see also Free \nman, \n503 U.S. at 491. \nWhile I agree with my colleagues on the first prong of their test, \nI do not agree\"that examining \"whether the vestiges of past \ndiscrimi~ \nnation halve]  eliminated to the extent practicable,\" Dowell, 498 \n~n \nU.S. at 249~50, requires a district court~-as a matter of law-to con \nsider a remedial plan conceived, drafted, and offered by one of the \nparties during the lawsuit as an obvious defense to it. The plain mean \ning of the relevant language is that in some desegregation cases sim \nple compliance with the court's orders is not enough for meaningful \ndesegregation to take place. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25 (stating that \n\"a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effective \nness\"). For example, a decree entered in the 1960s or 1970s could \nhave underestimated the extent of the remedy required, or changes in \nthe school district could have rendered the decree obsolete. In either \ncase, a district court must look beyond mere compliance with the \noriginal decree and ask whether the vestiges of the dual system have \nbeen eliminated to the extent practicable. In the present case, the dis \ntrict court undertook such an inquiry. Not only did the district court \naddress compliance, but it also looked beyond the original decree and \nexamined how the extensive changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg \narea have affected the dismantling of the former dual system. Hence, \nI do not believe that Dowell and Freeman required the district court \nas a matter of law to have considered CMS' s eleventh-hour remedial \nplan. \n109 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 107 of 128\n\nLikewise, I do not believe that the district court ran afoul of Fed-\neral Rule of Evidence 402 when it refused to consider the remedial \nplan. Rule 402, of course, declares that \"[a]11 relevant evidence is \nadmissible.\" Even relevant evidence may be excluded, however, when \nits probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of \nthe needless presentation of cumulative evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. \n403. And CMS's remedial plan was certainly cumulative, citing and \nsummarizing several expert reports which had been admitted into evi \ndence. For example, the plan's discussion of faculty assignment is \nbased on the reports of Dr. William Trent, Dr. Robert Peterkin, and \nDr. Roslyn Mickelson; the plan's discussion of facilities is based on \nDr. Gardner's report; the plan's discussion of the achievement gap \nbetween blacks and whites is based on the reports of Dr. Trent, Dr. \nPeterkin, and Dr. Mickelson; and the plan's student assignment dis \ncussion is based on Dr. Gordon Foster's report. All of the aforemen \ntioned reports were admitted into evidence and the authors of the \nreports testified at the hearing and were subject to cross-examination. \nHence, much of the remedial plan was cumulative, providing the dis \ntrict court witk but a rehashing of expert reports and testimony. \nTo the extent th~{ the remedial plan contained relevant evidence \nappearing nowhere else in the record, I would hold that the exclusion \nof such evidence was hannless. According to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 61, a \"court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard \nany error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the sub \nstantial rights of the parties.\" Listing myriad deficiencies, objectives, \nand strategies, the thirty-one page remedial plan is often short on spe \ncifics. Considering the amount of evidence presented on every aspect \nof CMS' s operations during other phases of the two-month bench \ntrial, I cannot hold that the exclusion of the remedial plan affected \nCMS's substantial rights. See Ingram Coal Co. v. Mower. L.P., 892 \nF.2d 363, 366 (4th Cir. 1989) (applying Rule 61). Because the exclu \nsion of the remedial plan in no way renders the judgment below sus \npect, the district court's treatment of the plan cannot support reversal. \nIII. Magnet Schools \nI tum now to Capacchione' s challenge to CMS' s 1992 magnet \nschools plan. Specifically, Capacchione contends that his daughter \n110 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 108 of 128\n\nChristina was unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school \nprogram on account of her race. \nAs noted previously. CMS operated its schools in nearly perfect \nracial balance for almost twenty years under a pupil assignment plan. \nadopted by the board and approved by the district court in 1974. \nwhich primarily utilized \"optional schools.\" paired elementary \nschools. satellite attendance zones, and a feeder system. In 1991. \nhowever. CMS hired Dr. Stolee to examine racial imbalance that was \nbeing caused anew by the demographic shifts and population growth \nin the City of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County and, in \n1992. implemented a new pupil assignment plan drafted by Dr. \nStolee. entitled \"CMS Student Assignment Plan: A New Generation \nof Excellence. \" This new plan emphasized the use of magnet schools, \nwhich would allow CMS to phase out the more unpopular paired ele \nmentary schools. Magnet schools, many of which were located in pre \ndominately black neighborhoods, offered a specialized curriculum or \ninnovative instructional style not found in the other schools in the sys-\ntem.  . \n~~~ \n-\nFormer SuperinteDdent Murphy oversaw implementation of the \nStolee plan and testified that the magnet program was adopted \nbecause CMS \"wanted to attract more white youngsters into the inner \ncity schools\" in order to meet CMS's racial-balance goals. lA. VI-\n2109. Dr. Stolee observed in his report that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nhas had a long and successful experience with mandatory school \nassignments.\" but that in order to combat demographic shifts CMS \nshould adopt a plan based on voluntarism. J.A. XXXD-1S,S81; g \nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, SIS U.S. 10, 92 (199S) (Jenkins lID \n(\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary move \nment of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegre \ngation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and \nredrawing of district boundary lines. \"). A desegregation plan using \nmagnet schools, according to Dr. Stolee, would \"give[] each parent \nan opportunity to make a choice between a school serving the area in \nwhich the family resides, a school in some other area, or a school \noffering a very specific attractive program.\" I.A. XXXII-1S.S80. Dr. \nStolee also recognized that the magnet-centered plan would be a dra \nmatic shift from the prior desegregation plan. Thus, as part of the \nplan, he recommended that CMS secure approval from the district \n111 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 109 of 128\n\ncourt before making any changes. Indeed, Dr. Stolee's \"RECOM \nMENDATION #1,\" out of forty-four, read: \nTHE SCHOOL BOARD, THROUGH LEGAL COUNSEL, \nSHOULD APPROACH THE FEDERAL COURT TO \nSECURE APPROVAL TO CHANGE mE COURT \nORDERED DESEGREGATION PLAN. \nI.A. XXXll-15,578. This recommendation was consistent with the \nprior district court order directing CMS to apply to the district court \n\"before making any material departure\" from the approved desegrega \ntion  311 F. Supp. at 270. However, CMS ignored Dr. \nplan.~, \nStolee's advice and the district court's instruction, choosing instead \nto withhold these changes in the desegregation plan from the district \ncourt. \nThe crux of the problem with CMS' s magnet school plan is its \nadmissions process. As aptly described by the district court, it oper \nates as \nfollqw~: \nAt the stitH of the process, CMS flrst fLlls seats with prefer \nences based on whether the applicant lives in close proxim \nity to the school and whether the applicant has any siblings \nin the school. CMS then fllls the remaining seats by select \ning students from a black lottery and a non-black lottery \nuntil the precise racial balance is achieved. \nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 287 (internal citations omitted). Seek \ning a balance of sixty percent white and forty percent black in the \nmagnet schools. CMS decreed in its 1992 student assignment plan \nthat magnet \"slots reserved for one race will not be fllled by students \nof another race.\" I.A. XXXll-lS,702. The result of this policy was \nthat if a sufficient number of blacks or whites did not apply and flll \nthe seats allotted to their respective races, then those seats would be \nleft vacant. Though some exceptions were made, Superintendent Eric \nSmith testifled that CMS generally adhered to the policy. See I.A. \nXV-7217. \nThe district court appropriately examined the magnet schools \nthrough a pre-unitary status lens, observing \"that the current litigation \n112 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 110 of 128\n\nstarted not as a petition for unitary status but as a discrimination suit \narising out of Christina Capacchione' s denial of admission to a mag \nnet school based on her race.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 284. \nThe district court recognized that school officials acting pursuant to \na desegregation order are immune from liability for actions taken con \nsistent with that order. See Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694,696 \n(4th Cir. 1973) (law enforcement officials who confined the plaintiff \npursuant to a court order were immune from § 1983 suit); see also \nWolfe v. City of Pittsburgh, 140 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1998) (offi \ncials acting pursuant to court order establishing quotas for promotions \nare not subject to § 1983 liability); Turney v. O'Toole, 898 F.2d 1470, \n1472-73 (10th Cir. 1990) (holding that so long as a court order is \nfacially valid, officials acting pursuant to that order are immune from \na damages suit); Coverdell v. De.partment of Soc. & Health Servs., \n834 F.2d 758, 764 (9th Cir. 1987) (social worker is immune from \n§ 1983 liability when executing a facially valid court order). How \never, the district court concluded that the use of magnet schools had \nnever been approved and that the rigid racial quotas of the magnet \nadmissions policy were \"beyond the scope of the Court's mandate.\" \nCapacchione, 57_ F. Supp. 2d at 285. The district court then subjected \nthe admissions policy to strict scrutiny, holding that the policy vio \nlated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nbecause it was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state \ninterest of remedying past discrimination. I would affirm. \nA.lmmunity \nI begin with the question of whether the CMS officials are entitled \nto immunity because their actions in adopting and implementing the \nStolee magnet program in 1992 were taken pursuant to and were con \nsistent with the desegregation orders and opinions issued by the dis \ntrict court and Supreme Court in the early 19705. CMS asserts that it \nis entitled to immunity for its act of implementing the 1992 magnet \nschools program without court approval because the prior desegrega \ntion orders authorized the use of \"optional schools\" and a racial bal \nance goal for filling them. Like the district court, I conclude that the \nmagnet schools plan, as implemented, was not authorized by the prior \ncourt orders and that, for the reasons stated hereafter, the CMS offi \ncials are not entitled to immunity. \n113 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 111 of 128\n\nIn 1970, the district court issued a desegregation order to CMS, \nnoting that the order was \"not based upon any requirement of 'racial \nbalance.''' Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 267 (emphasis added). The court \nreiterated \"that efforts should be made to reach a 71·29 ratio in the \nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one \nschool is racially different from the others, but [recognized] that vari \nations from the nonn may be unavoidable.\" Id. at 267-68 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The district court also gave CMS wide dis \ncretion in implementing the desegregation measures by \"encourag \nling] [CMS offICials] to use their full'Jmow-how' and resources to \nattain\" the desired results. Id. at 269. However, the district court con \ncurrently warned that this \"maximum discretion ... to choose meth \nods that will accomplish the required result\" was not limitless, \ndirecting the board to obtain leave of court \"before making any mate \nrial departure from any specific requirement set out\" in the order. Id. \nat 270. On appeal, the Supreme Court affinned the district court's \ndecision and also addressed the subject of racial quotas. See Swann, \n402 U.S. at 23-25. Specifically, with regard to the district court's goal \nof achieving a. racial balance of seventy-one percent white and \ntwenty-nine percent black, the Court took care to note that \"[t]he con \nstitutional cOrIUJUmd to desegregate schools does not mean that every \nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition \nof the school system as a whole\" and that had the district court \"re \nquire[d], as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular \ndegree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disap \nproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24. \nThe goal was upheld, however, because the \"use made of mathemati \ncal ratios was no more than a starting point in the process of shaping \na remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 2S. \nIn 1974, the district court approved new guidelines and policies \nadopted by the board, which included the use of \"optional schools.\" \nSwann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04. These optional schools placed more \n\"emphasis on open or traditional education than nonnally offered in \nconventional schools.\" I.A. XXXII-lS,683. The optional schools' tra \nditional programs \"offer[ed] an enriched and highly structured educa \ntion,\" lA. XXXII-lS,732, whereas the open programs offered a \n\"student-centered\" environment that \"encouraged [students] to take \nresponsibility for their behavior and for their own learning.\" I. A. \nXXXII-lS,733. The optional schools approved by the 1974 order \n114 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 112 of 128\n\nwere far from being as diverse and specialized as the magnet school \nprogram implemented in 1992. The program suggested by Dr. Stolee \noffered schools specializing in traditional and open educational meth \nods and created specialized curriculum schools featuring the Montes \nsori method; science, mathematics, and technology; foreign language \nimmersion; learning immersion programs for young children; \nenhanced education for academically gifted students; and communi \ncation studies programs. See J.A. XXXll-1573041. However, both \nthe optional schools and the magnet schools were designed to achieve \nthe same end result-to attract students to a school in a particular \nlocation by using a specialized curriculum or teaching technique. \nThus, Dr. Stolee, in recommending the magnet program in 1992, \nobserved that eMS, via its optional schools, \"had some experience in \nsuch specialized schools.\" J.A. XXXll-15,580. \nConsistent with the district court's 1971 ruling that a flexible goal \nbe set for individual schools, the district court also approved an \noptional schools admissions policy which provided that \"optional \nschool enrollinents will be controlled starting with 1974 so that they \nare open to  residents and have about or above 20% black \nalI9~':ffity \nstudents,\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104, and recognized that the \"ac \ntual enrollment of the optional school may have to be guided by its \nracial composition and by the number drawn from each other school \narea, not by considerations of space and program only,\" id. at 1108. \nAdditionally, the policy directed that \"[r]eassignments to optional \nschools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any other \nschool.\" Id. These modifications. however. at no time set a racial \nquota or ratio of the type disapproved of by the district court in its \nearlier orders and by the Supreme Court in its 1971 review of the dis \ntrict court's 1970 order.9 \n9 I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court's \ndisapproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is solely \na limitation on a district court's remedial power, and that school authori \nties may impose such rigid racial quotas to remedy the identical wrong. \nIn Swann, the Court addressed the authority of the district court to \nimpose rigid racial quotas, but did not explicitly address the issue of \nwhether school authorities could do so. ~,402 U.S. at 24-25. The \nsame day, however. the Court struck down a state anti-busing law \nbecause it \"flatly forb[ade] assignment of any student on account of race \n115 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 113 of 128\n\nFinally, despite the district court's 1970 directive that CMS obtain \ncourt approval for material modifications to the court-imposed deseg \nregation plan, the approval process that took place in the ensuing \nyears, and Dr. Stolee' s specific recommendation that CMS seek court \napproval for the new magnet schools program in 1992, CMS inexpli \ncably chose not to return to the district court to obtain approval of the \nmagnet schools program and its strict admissions process. Conse \nquently. the district court was never given the opportunity to rule \nupon its permissibility as a desegregation tool prior to its implementa \ntion and CMS was never required by court order to implement it. \nNevertheless, I recognize that magnet schools are frequently used \nby school districts under a desegregation order. See Milliken v. Brad \n!sIt 433 U.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken ill (approving of magnet \nschools as a desegregation tool). Indeed, the plaintiff-intervenors' \nown expert has touted magnet programs as an \"effective way to attract \nsizable numbers of white students to predominately minority \nschools.\" David J. Armor, Forced Justice: School Dese&re&ation and \nthe Law 223 (.1995). Thus. a magnet schools program, properly imple \nmented, can no doubt be an effective desegregation tool. However, a \neMs \nconclusion that  was free to adopt any form of magnet school \nor for the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools. \nII \nNorth Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43,45 (1971). \nThis time addressing race-based assignments as a tool available to \n\"school authorities . . . to fulfill[ ] their constitutional obligation to elimi \nnate existing dual school systems,\" the Court reiterated Swann's distinc \ntion between unacceptable rigid quotas and acceptable quotas used as \n\"starting points in shaping a remedy.\" Id. at 46. \nCommon sense likewise compels me to reject the view that Swann for \nbids courts to impose inflexible quotas, but sanctions the identical action \nby school authorities. Under such a reading of Swann, school authorities \nwould be at liberty to implement programs to remedy the effects of seg \nregation which the district court would be prohibited from ordering for \nthe identical remedial purpose. However, whether imposed by a court \nupon a recalcitrant school board or voluntarily adopted by a school board \nto meet the requirements of Brown and Green. the constitutional implica \ntions are the same. Even when intended to serve a permissible remedial \npurpose, unduly rigid race-based assignments exceed permissible limits \nof race-based remedial action. \n116 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 114 of 128\n\nprogram it might wish to see in place does not flow from this general \nproposition. \nNor do I find authorization for CMS' s actions in the language of \nthe prior court orders which CMS points to for support of its immu \nnity argument. At most, the portions of the district court order autho \nrizing \"optional schools\" could perhaps be read in isolation as \nauthorizing CMS's use of \"magnet schools\" in more diverse, special \nized areas, although I would still have difficulty excusing CMS' s fail \nure to seek the requisite prior court approval for such a material \nexpansion. I need not resolve this closer question, however, because \nCMS's program went much further than simply expanding the num \nber and types of specialized schools, be they called \"optional\" or \n\"magnet.\" Under no circumstances could I accept CMS's assertion \nthat the inflexible racial quotas mandated by the expanded magnet \nschool program was countenanced by the prior court orders. The \noptional school order, relied on by CMS, required school officials to \nstrive for a minimum level of twenty percent black enrollment in \noptional schools. The same order required CMS to ensure that \noptional schools  not jeopardize the desegregation of other schools. \n~.id \nBut the prior orders did not approve a use of race to the extent that \nCMS could deny eager applicants an otherwise available slot in a \nmagnet program solely on account of the applicant's race. On the con \ntrary, both the district court and the Supreme Court in this very case \nconsistently rejected the use of such rigid racial quotas. \nI also find no authorization for the board's adoption of the magnet \nschools program in the Supreme Court's 1971 approval in ~ of \na majority-to-minority transfer policy that would prevent, for exam \nple, an African-American child in a majority white school from trans \nferring to a majority black school because the transfer would increase \nthe degree of segregation in the affected schools. See Swann, 402 U.S. \nat 26. Because the majority-to-minority transfer policy, like the mag \nnet admissions policy, prevents a child from enrolling in the public \nschool of his choice, the majority concludes that the magnet admis \nsions policy is pennissible. By definition, however. CMS' s special \nized magnet programs are not tantamount to conventional public \nschools. While a child denied a transfer from one conventional school \nto another still receives the same general education, a child denied \nadmission to a specialized magnet program does not receive a similar \n117 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 115 of 128\n\nbenefit in a conventional school. In other words, an education in a \nmagnet school offering, for example, foreign language immersion, is \nnot interchangeable with an education in a conventional public school.l0 \nHence, the effect of the magnet admissions policy is far different from \nthe majority-ta-minority transfer policy. \nThe end result of the challenged magnet schools admissions policy \nis placement of racial quotas ahead of educating students-wan inap \npropriate result nowhere countenanced in the district court's orders or \nin the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions. Cf. Wright v. Council \nof the City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451, 463 (1972) (holding that courts \nshould not approve a desegregation plan if the plan offers \"' quality \neducation'.Jo some children, [but] has a substantial adverse effect \nupon the quality of education available to others\"). In fact, Brown I \nstruck down segregated schooling because children were denied equal \neducational opportunities. See Brown 1,347 U.S. at 493. While school \nboards were permitted to use race in assigning students in order to \nconvert to a unitary system, see North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. \nSwann, 402.lJ.s. 43. 46 (1971) (holding that the use of race in pupil \nassignments is \"qne tool absolutely essential to fulfillment of [a \nschool board's] constitutional obligation to eliminate existing dual \nschool systems\"), the Brown opinions never contemplated that this \nremedial use of race, like the old dual system, would deny some stu \ndents educational opportunities solely because of their race. See \nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 493 (holding that an educational opportunity \nprovided by the state \"must be made available to all on equal terms\"); \nsee also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 305 (Powell, J.) (\"When a classification \ndenies an individual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely \nbecause of his race or ethnic background, it must be regarded as sus \npect. \").11 In my view, an admissions policy that would deny an avail-\n10 I recognize that parents might perceive that one \"fungible\" conven \ntional school is superior to another because of a number of intangibles \nsuch as the reputation of teachers or the newness of facilities. However, \nthese \"personal preferences\" do not rise to a level of constitutional signif \nicance. See Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d \n358, 380 n.43 (W.O. Ky. 2000). Magnet schools, on the other hand, are \na completely different animal and therefore the admissions process used \nmust be more closely scrutinized. \n11 Though the present case was brought on behalf of a white child \ndenied admission to a magnet school, the policy as written could have \n118 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 116 of 128\n\nable. unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child, \nwhether black or white. on account of the child's race cannot be \nsquared with the district court's orders or the Supreme Court's deseg \nregation decisions. It is improper to attempt to establish equal protec \ntion of the laws in the realm of public education by denying children \nan equal opportunity to compete for open. unclaimed slots in CMS's \nextraordinary magnet schools. I agree with the district court that the \npolicy is ultra vires and that CMS officials are not entitled to immu \nnity. \nB. Equal Protection \nHaving determined that the CMS officials are not entitled to imUlU \noity for the implementation of the strict race-based magnet school \nassignment policy, I now turn to the question of whether the officials' \nact of implementing the policy without prior court approval. albeit \nwhile under an order to desegregate schools, runs afoul of the Equal \nProtection clause. I conclude that it does . \n.. . \n. ' \n' \nUnder the  Amendment, \"[n]o State shall ... deny to any \nFou~nth \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, § 1. By guaranteeing equal protection, the \nAmendment recognizes that \"[d]istinctions between citizens solely \nbecause of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free peo \nple whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. \" \nHirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). The Supreme \nCourt has refused to make exceptions for so-called \"benign\" racial \nsee \nclassifications.  Adarand Constructors. Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, \n227 (1995), and the Court has made clear that \"all racial classifica \ntions, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, \nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\" id.12 \njust as easily denied a black child admission to the magnet school. See \nHampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 377 \n(W.D. Ky. 2(00) (racial quota in a magnet school resulting in black stu \ndents being denied admission even though the school was several hun \ndred students below capacity). \n12 The Supreme Court's application of strict scrutiny has indeed been \nunwavering. In Adarand, the Court refused to apply a lesser standard of \n119 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 117 of 128\n\nTo survive strict scrutiny, CMS' s use of race in the magnet admis· \nsions program \"must (1) serve a compelling governmental interest and \n(2) be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. \" Tuttle v. Arlington \nCounty Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698, 704 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. dismissed, \n120 S. Ct. 1552 (2000). CMS avers that the magnet admissions policy \nscrutiny to racial classifications enacted by Congress. Though Congress \nitself is charged with enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of \nequal protection via \"appropriate legislation,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \n§ 5, the Supreme Court in interpreting the Fifth Amendment held Con· \ngress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities. \nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (observing \"that any person, of whatever \nrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the \nConstitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to \nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\"). \nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not \napply when· a 'SChool district is under court order to dismantle the dual \nsystem. Such an. approach , however, ignores two of the three pillars of \nSupreme Court's equal protection analysis: skepticism of all racial pref \nerences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of \nthe race of the person burdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at \n223-24. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, the \napproach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court \norder of the necessary tools required to establish a unitary schools sys \ntem. \nThe point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the gov \nernment in support of a racial classification, and the evidence \noffered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to \ndistinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in govern \nmental decisionmaking .... Strict scrutiny does not \"trea[t] dis \nsimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally \nobjectionable\"; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all govern \nmental race-based decisions in order to decide which are consti \ntutionally objectionable and which are not. \nId. at 228 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful \nevaluation demanded by the Supreme Court will preserve inviolate \nproper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of \ndesegregating a government actor does not stand equal protection on its \nhead by denying some students educational opportunities solely because \nof their race. \n120 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 118 of 128\n\nwas adopted to remedy the effects of the dual school system previ \nously operated in Mecklenburg County. Without question, remedying \nthe effects of past discrimination is a compelling state interest. ~ \nCity of Richmond v. lA. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989). \nIn reviewing whether a policy is narrowly tailored to serve a com \npelling state interest, a court considers factors such as: \n(1) the necessity of the policy and the efficacy of alternative \nrace neutral policies; \n(2) the planned duration of the policy; \n(3) the relationship between the numerical goal and the per \ncentage of minority group members in the relevant popula \ntion; \n(4) the flexibility of the policy, including the provision of \nwaivers if the goal cannot be met; and \n-\n(5) the burden of the policy on innocent third parties. \nSee United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987) (plurality \nopinion). Like the district court, I would conclude that the CMS mag \nnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. \n-,'-\nFirst, the magnet admissions policy was not necessary to comply \nwith the court's order to dismantle the dual educational system. CMS \nhad a number of options available to it that would not have deprived \nchildren, solely on account of their race, an available seat in a special \nized magnet program. There is no evidence in the record that added \nflexibility or a waiver provision would have undermined the use of \nmagnet schools as a desegregation technique. The evidence simply \ndoes not reveal that the magnet admissions policy used was the only \nefficacious option available to CMS. \nSecond, this circuit has emphasized that \"[t]he use of racial prefer \nences must be limited so that they do not outlast their need; they may \nnot take on a life of their own.\" Hayes v. North State Law Enforce-\n121 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 119 of 128\n\nment Ass'n, 10 F.3d 207, 216 (4th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Like the district court, I can find \"no mention of the \nduration that CMS would use racially segregated lotteries, vacancies, \nand waiting lists.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. In light of \nCMS's desire to remain under court order for the indefinite future, see \nsupra Part n.H, the lack of a duration for the magnet admissions pol~ \nicy is not surprising. CMS was apparently content to leave available \nmagnet seats empty, despite the waiting lists, for years to come. \nThird, I agree with the district court that \"the 6040 numerical goal \nis related to the relevant population, i.e., the racial composition of \nschoolchildren in CMS.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. \nHow~ \never, there is no evidence that CMS considered the \"practicability of \nachieving this precise ratio in every magnet school,\" id. at 290, or the \nvery real danger that magnet schools would be underutilized because \nseats would be left open despite an abundance of applicants. The \nresult of the admissions policy is but another indication that the CMS \nadministration, in the words of former Superintendent Murphy, \"was \nmore focu~Dn balance than on [educational] outcomes.\" I.A. VI~ \n2687. \nFourth, the district court aptly described the inflexibility in the \nmagnet admissions policy: \"The Court is hard-pressed to fInd a more \nrestrictive means of using race than a process that results in holding \nseats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager applicants are virtu \nally ignored.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. The policy is \nindeed \"restrictive,\" but it also borders on obduracy. The policy con \ntained no written waiver provision which, once again, shows a lack \nof concern that these highly specialized schools could and would be \nunderutilized . \nFinally, the innocent parties affected are children denied magnet \nslots solely because of their race and parents who \"must wait for \nmonths without knowing where their children eventually will be \nplaced.\" Id. at 290. A child's education is one of the greatest concerns \nof the family, and CMS unnecessarily causes much agonizing when \nit places children of the \"wrong color\" on waiting lists while it \nactively recruits children of the \"right color\" to fill empty magnet \nschool seats. \n122 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 120 of 128\n\nIn sum, the magnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. The \npolicy is not necessary to dismantle the de jure system, is for an \nunlimited duration, provides for virtually no flexibility, and burdens \ninnocent children and their families. The inequities of CMS's magnet \nadmissions policy call to mind why strict scrutiny is used in the first \nplace: \"Of all the criteria by which men and women can be judged, \nthe most pernicious is that of race.\" Maryland Troopers Ass'n v. \nEvans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). Teaching young children \nthat admission to a specialized academic program with available seats \nis contingent on their race is indeed pernicious, and CMS's magnet \nadmissions policy can in no way be described as narrowly tailored to \nachieve the compelling interest of remedying past discrimination. 13 \nC. Award of Nominal Damages \nAfter finding a constitutional violation in the magnet schools. the \ndistrict court held CMS \"nominally liable in the amount of one dol \nlar.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. CMS argues that the nomi \nnal damages awarded were unjustified because the actions resulting \nin a constitution.aI-violation were taken in good faith. CMS fears that \nthe damages award will \"open the door to numerous suits by other \nstudents who could claim that they did suffer actual damages and \nargue that collateral estoppel prevents CMS from denying liability.\" \nDefendants-Appellants' Brief at 24. Regarding nominal damages, the \nSupreme Court has observed: \nCommon-law courts traditionally have vindicated depriva \ntions of certain \"absolute\" rights that are not shown to have \ncaused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of \n13 CMS also presented diversity as an alternative compelling state inter \nest. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. In this circuit, it is unsettled \nwhether diversity may be a compelling state interest. See Eisenbere v. \nMontgOmery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. \ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000). Assuming without deciding whether \ndiversity may be a compelling state interest. I would hold that the magnet \nadmissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. Whether \nthe interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions \npolicy as currently written is in no sense narrow. It is difficult to imagine \nany interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored. \n123 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 121 of 128\n\nmoney. By making the deprivation of such rights actionable \nfor nominal damages without proof of actual injury, the law \nrecognizes the importance to organized society that those \nrights be scrupulously observed; but at the same time, it \nremains true to the principle that substantial damages should \nbe awarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case \nof exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish mali \ncious deprivations of rights. \nCarey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,266 (1978) (nominal damages avail \nable for denial of procedural due process rights) (footnote omitted); \nsee also Price v. City of Charlotte, 93 F.3d 1241, 1246 (4th Cit. 1996) \n(stating that \"the rationale for the award of nominal damages being \nthat federal courts should provide some marginal vindication for a \nconstitutional violation H). In the present case there was indeed a con \nstitutional violation. CMS ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause \nwhen it adopted a magnet school admissions policy designed to deny \nan available, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child \non account ofihe child's race. In order to recover nominal damages, \nChristina Capacchione need not prove that absent the unconstitutional \npolicy she would' fiave been admitted to the magnet program. The \ninjury in the present case is not the ultimate inability to enroll in the \nmagnet school, but the inability to compete for open, unclaimed seats \non an equal basis. See Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,666 \n(1993). Though the two open \"black seats\" at the Olde Providence \nmagnet school were eventually awarded to white children, the fact \nremains that the official magnet admissions policy prohibited children \nlike Christina from competing for the open slots. In fact, CMS left the \ntwo available \"black seats\" at Olde Providence unfilled for most of \nthe summer while Christina and over one hundred other white chil \ndren languished on a waiting list. The nominal award in this case rec \nognizes the importance of equal protection under the law and provides \nsome measure of vindication. As for CMS's worry about collateral \nestoppel, liability has already been established, and vacating the nom \ninal damages would not change this. In sum, I would hold that the dis \ntrict court did not err in awarding nominal damages. \nIV. Injunctive Relief \nAfter recounting the unitary status determination and the constitu \ntional violation in $e magnet admissions policy, the district court \n124 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 122 of 128\n\nenjoined \"CMS from any further use of race-based lotteries~ prefer \nences, and set-asides in student assignment.\" Capacchione, 57 F. \nSupp. 2d at 292. CMS challenges the district court's injunction as \nunwarranted and overbroad. \nBefore a court grants a permanent injunction, the court must first \nfind necessity--a danger of future violations. See Connecticut v. Mas \nsachusetts, 282 U.S. 660,674 (1931) (stating that an injunction \"will \nnot be granted against something merely feared as liable to occur at \nsome indefinite time in the future\"); United States v. Oregon State \nMeet. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (\"All it takes to make the cause \nof action for relief by injunction is a real threat of future violation or \na contemporary violation of a nature likely to continue or to recur. \"); \nBloodgood v. Gaqaghty, 783 F.2d 470,475 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"An \ninjunction is a drastic remedy and will not issue unless there is an \nimminent threat of illegal action. \"). Though a flexible tool, an injunc \ntion may not be used for \"punishment or reparations for ... past vio \nlations.\" Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. at 333. \nThe district court's finding of a threat of future violations centered \non CMS's offermg of diversity as a compelling state interest. This \ninterest was offered after the district court decided that the admissions \npolicy should be reviewed using strict scrutiny. Because in this circuit \nit is unsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest, \nsee Eisenberg v. Monteomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130 \n(4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000), it was improper \nfor the district court to base its injunction on CMS' s unsuccessful \ndefense of the policy. At this point. I can discern nothing in the record \nindicating that CMS will ignore the district court order and continue \nto use race in an unconstitutional manner in the operation of the mag \nnet schools or other schools in the system. CMS represented to the \ndistrict court both during and after trial that it had no intention of con \ntinuing the magnet plan. In moving for a stay of the injunction, CMS \ndid not ask that the injunction be stayed as to the magnet schools, and \nwas prepared to comply immediately with the court's order. CMS \nrequested a stay as to the non-magnet schools because over 50,000 \nstudents were likely to be reassigned in a short period of time. More \nover, there was no evidence presented at trial about what CMS pro \nposed to do as a unitary school system. A post-unitary status student \nassignment plan was never given to the district court, and the evi-\n125 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 123 of 128\n\ndence simply does not indicate that \"there is an imminent threat of \nillegal action.  Bloodgood. 783 F.2d at 475. Hence, 1 agree with the \nIt \nultimate conclusion of the majority that the district court erred in \ngranting injunctive relief. \nV. Discovery Sanctions \nThe district court sanctioned CMS for failing to supplement its \nanswers to interrogatories that sought a list of witnesses. We review \nthe district court's management of discovery under the abuse of dis \ncretion standard. See Anderson v. Foundation for Advancement. Educ. \n& Employment of Am. Indians, 155 F.3d SOO, 504 (4th Cir. 1998). \nThe recora reveals that no list of fact witnesses was presented to the \nplaintiff-intervenors until five days before the trial date. At that time, \nCMS presented a list of 174 witness, which was later cut to twenty \nsix. The plaintiff-intervenors moved for sanctions and the court \ngranted the motion in part. The court had to continue the trial for one \nweek so that the plaintiff-intervenors could depose the newly dis \nclosed witnesses, and the court held CMS accountable for the fees and \nexpenses of theSt? ~epositions. \nWe have developed a four-part test for a district court to use when \ndetermining what sanctions to impose under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 37. Specifically, \"[t]he court must determine (1) whether \nthe non-complying party acted in bad faith, (2) the amount of preju \ndice that noncompliance caused the adversary, (3) the need for deter \nrence of the particular sort of non-compliance, and (4) whether less \ndrastic sanctions would have been effective.\" Id. An examination of \nthe four factors reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court. \nFirst, there is ample evidence of bad faith. Early in the case, the \nplaintiff-intervenors presented CMS with an interrogatory asking for \ndisclosure of trial witnesses. In response to the interrogatory, CMS \nstated that it would provide appropriate information concerning wit \nnesses at the time and in the manner specified by the district court. \nThe plaintiff-intervenors moved to compel discovery, and the court \nagreed with CMS that the request was premature. However, the court \ninstructed CMS to \"supplement its responses [to the interrogatories], \nas it promised, when such information becomes known.\" I.A. 1-195. \nAs an excuse for its untimely disclosure of fact witnesses, CMS relies \n126 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 124 of 128\n\non the court's pre-trial order, which provides that \"[a] witness list \ncontaining the name of every proposed witness\" should be filed with \nthe court on the first day of trial. lA. 1-150. This provision of the pre \ntrial order was clearly for the court's convenience and could not rea \nsonably be interpreted to apply to disclosures to the other parties. \nBesides, even if such an interpretation were reasonable, the court's \ncommand to supplement interrogatories superceded the pre-trial \norder. Accordingly. bad faith is evident. \nSecond, the presentation of such a lengthy witness list on the eve \nof trial to the plaintiff-intervenors was prejudicial. Without the action \nof the court, the plaintiff-intervenors would have had no opportunity \nto depose the witnesses, much less properly prepare for trial. Thus, \nCMS's failure to supplement interrogatories was prejudicial. \nThird, such non-compliance with the district court's orders cer-\ntainly needed to be deterred. The district court's condonation of \nCMS's bad faith at a time so close to the beginning of trial could have \nencouraged repetition of improper conduct. As found by the district \ncourt, the recor~)ndicates that the failure to supplement interrogato \nries was not the first time CMS \"was lacking in candor in disclosing \nrelevant and important information.\" lA. 1-305. Hence, deterrence \nwas essential to a proper management of this case. \nFinally. less drastic sanctions would not have been effective. Per \nmitting the plaintiff-intervenors to depose witnesses and requiring \nCMS to pay fees·and expenses for the depositions was appropriate. \nCMS was fortunate to receive such a light sanction, and it is doubtful \nwhether lesser measures would have had any effect on CMS's con \nduct. \nIn sum, I agree with the majority that the discovery sanctions \nimposed did not amount to an abuse of the district court's discretion. \nVI. Attorney Fees \nCMS argues that the district court erred in awarding Capacchione \nattorney fees because (1) Capacchione received only nominal dam \nages, and (2) young Capacchione would not have been admitted to the \n127 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 125 of 128\n\nmagnet program even if race was not a factor insofar as her lottery \nnumber was so high. 14 Under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988(b) (West. Supp. \n2000), \"[iJn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of \n[§ 1983 and other civil rights laws] . . . the court. in its discretion. \nmay allow the prevailing party. other than the United States, a reason \nable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" To be considered a prevailing \nparty. a party must \"succeed on any significant issue in litigation \nwhich achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing \nsuit.\" Farrar v. Hobbv, 506 U.S. 103. 109 (1992) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). In Farrar, the Supreme Court specifically addressed \nthe issue of nominal damages and prevailing party status: \nWe therefore hold that a plaintiff who wins nominal dam \nages is a prevailing party under § 1988 .... A plaintiff may \ndemand payment for nominal damages no less than he may \ndemand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory \ndamages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether \ncompensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behav \nior :fOf the plaintiff s benefit by forcing the defendant to pay \nan amouJlt of money he otherwise would not pay . \n. :: . \nId. at 112·13 (internal citations omitted). The award of nominal dam \nages constitutes relief on the merits and affects CMS' s behavior \ntoward Capacchione if only by forcing CMS to pay. Hence, Capacch \nione is a prevailing party. See also Shaw v. Hunt, 154 F.3d 161. 164 \n(4th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"persons within the generic category of \nplaintiff-intervenors have often been found by courts to fit within the \nrubric 'prevailing party' for fees purposes\"). That young Capacchione \nhad a high lottery number is irrelevant for a determination of prevail \ning party status. \nI would also affirm the attorney fee award to the plaintiff \nintervenors to the extent that it compensates them for their litigation \n14 CMS concedes that if unitary status is upheld, Grant is entitled to \nattorney fees. However, CMS takes a much different view of Capacch \nione's actions insofar as Capacchione originally attacked only the mag \nnet program and did not have sights set on unitary status. Nonetheless, \nthe record is clear that Capacchione actively participated with Grant in \nthe unitary status litigation. \n128 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 126 of 128\n\nof the unitary status issue. Monitoring of a school desegregation \ndecree is crucial to the dismantling of the dual system. See Jenkins v. \nMissouri, 967 F.2d 1248, 1251 (8th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, efforts \n\"to insure full compliance and to ensure that the plan is indeed work· \ning to desegregate the school system, are compensable services. \" \nNorthcross v. Board of Educ., 611 F.2d 624,637 (6th Cir. 1979). The \nmajority correctly notes that \"success in reaching that last stage [in a \ndesegregation case] is often appropriately credited to the original \nplaintiffs who brought the case.\" Ante at 71. However, the unique \nposture of this case, with the school board and the original plaintiffs \nresisting the resumption of local control, dictates looking at the award \nof fees in a different light. \nThe plaintiff-intervenors, through their work in litigating unitary \nstatus, have stepped into the shoes of the original plaintiffs and \nbrought this case to what I believe should be its close. Based on their \nmonitoring of CMS's activities and a belief that the decree had \n\"work[ed] to desegregate the school system,\"  Northcross, 611 F.2d at \n637, the pLaintiff·intervenors petitioned for a declaration of unitary \nstatus. Though most of the vital infonnation was in the hands of \nCMS's officials: -who were often uncooperative in the discovery pro \ncess, see Caoacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d. at 292-293 (cataloging sanc \ntions and threats of sanctions against CMS), the plaintiff-intervenors \nhave in my view prevailed on the issue of unitary status. In this regard \nthe plaintiff· intervenors have acted as \"private attorney[s] general,\" \nIndependent Fed'n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 758· \n60 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original), \nand the exceptional circumstances of this case indicate that a fee is \nproper. To avoid a declaration of unitary status, CMS has clung to the \ndesegregation decree for improper reasons, see supra part II.H, and \nthe equitable remedy ordered in 1969 \"would be far from complete, \nand justice would not be attained, if reasonable counsel fees were not \nawarded\" to the plaintiff-intervenors. Bell v. School Bd. of Powhatan \nCounty, 321 F.2d 494,500 (4th Cir. 1963) (awarding attorney fees in \nschool desegregation case based on exceptional circumstances)~ ~ \nalso Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 186 F.2d 473,481 (4th Cir. \n1950). A contrary result would hamper the involvement of concerned \ncitizens in school desegregation litigation and permit school boards \nthat are inclined to remain under court order to eschew a unitary sta-\n129 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 127 of 128\n\ntus hearing. Accordingly, I would affirm the district court's award of \nattorney fees. \nvn. \nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court's grant \nof unitary status in toto. Additionally, I would affirm the finding of \na constitutional violation in the magnet school admissions policy, the \naward of nominal damages, and the attorney fees award. Lastly. I con \ncur with the majority that the district court's injunction was unwar \nranted and that the district court's discovery sanctions were not an \nabuse of discretion. \n130 \nCase 3:65-cv-01974-RDP   Document 606   Filed 09/21/01   Page 128 of 128",

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \nWe granted certiorari in this case to review important issues as to the duties of school \nauthorities and the scope of powers of federal courts under this Court's mandates to \neliminate racially separate public schools established and maintained by state \naction. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). \nThis case and those argued with it[1] arose in States having a long history of maintaining two \nsets of schools in a 6*6 single school system deliberately operated to carry out a \ngovernmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race. That was \nwhat Brown v. Board of Education was all about. These cases present us with the problem \nof defining in more precise terms than heretofore the scope of the duty of school authorities \nand district courts in implementing Brown I and the mandate to eliminate dual systems and \nestablish unitary systems at once. Meanwhile district courts and courts of appeals have \nstruggled in hundreds of cases with a multitude and variety of problems under this Court's \ngeneral directive. Understandably, in an area of evolving remedies, those courts had to \nimprovise and experiment without detailed or specific guidelines. This Court, in Brown \nI, appropriately dealt with the large constitutional principles; other federal courts had to \ngrapple with the flinty, intractable realities of day-to-day implementation of those \nconstitutional commands. Their efforts, of necessity, embraced a process of \"trial and error,\" \nand our effort to formulate guidelines must take into account their experience. \nI \nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, the 43d largest in the Nation, encompasses the \ncity of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The area is large—\n550 square miles—spanning roughly 22 miles east-west and 36 miles north-south. During \nthe 1968-1969 school year the system served more than 84,000 pupils in 107 schools. \nApproximately 71% of the pupils were found to be white and 29% Negro. As of 7*7 June \n1969 there were approximately 24,000 Negro students in the system, of whom 21,000 \nattended schools within the city of Charlotte. Two-thirds of those 21,000—approximately \n14,000 Negro students—attended 21 schools which were either totally Negro or more than \n99% Negro. \nThis situation came about under a desegregation plan approved by the District Court at the \ncommencement of the present litigation in 1965, 243 F. Supp. 667 (WDNC), aff'd, 369 F. 2d \n29 (CA4 1966), based upon geographic zoning with a free-transfer provision. The present \nproceedings were initiated in September 1968 by petitioner Swann's motion for further relief \nbased on Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), and its companion \n\ncases.[2] All parties now agree that in 1969 the system fell short of achieving the unitary \nschool system that those cases require. \nThe District Court held numerous hearings and received voluminous evidence. In addition to \nfinding certain actions of the school board to be discriminatory, the court also found that \nresidential patterns in the city and county resulted in part from federal, state, and local \ngovernment action other than school board decisions. School board action based on these \npatterns, for example, by locating schools in Negro residential areas and fixing the size of \nthe schools to accommodate the needs of immediate neighborhoods, resulted in \nsegregated education. These findings were subsequently accepted by the Court of Appeals. \nIn April 1969 the District Court ordered the school board to come forward with a plan for \nboth faculty and student desegregation. Proposed plans were accepted by the court in June \nand August 1969 on an interim basis 8*8 only, and the board was ordered to file a third plan \nby November 1969. In November the board moved for an extension of time until February \n1970, but when that was denied the board submitted a partially completed plan. In \nDecember 1969 the District Court held that the board's submission was unacceptable and \nappointed an expert in education administration, Dr. John Finger, to prepare a \ndesegregation plan. Thereafter in February 1970, the District Court was presented with two \nalternative pupil assignment plans—the finalized \"board plan\" and the \"Finger plan.\" \nThe Board Plan. As finally submitted, the school board plan closed seven schools and \nreassigned their pupils. It restructured school attendance zones to achieve greater racial \nbalance but maintained existing grade structures and rejected techniques such as pairing \nand clustering as part of a desegregation effort. The plan created a single athletic league, \neliminated the previously racial basis of the school bus system, provided racially mixed \nfaculties and administrative staffs, and modified its free-transfer plan into an optional \nmajority-to-minority transfer system. \nThe board plan proposed substantial assignment of Negroes to nine of the system's 10 high \nschools, producing 17% to 36% Negro population in each. The projected Negro attendance \nat the 10th school, Independence, was 2%. The proposed attendance zones for the high \nschools were typically shaped like wedges of a pie, extending outward from the center of \nthe city to the suburban and rural areas of the county in order to afford residents of the \ncenter city area access to outlying schools. \nAs for junior high schools, the board plan rezoned the 21 school areas so that in 20 the \nNegro attendance would range from 0% to 38%. The other school, located in the heart of \nthe Negro residential area, was left with an enrollment of 90% Negro. \n9*9 The board plan with respect to elementary schools relied entirely upon gerrymandering \nof geographic zones. More than half of the Negro elementary pupils were left in nine \nschools that were 86% to 100% Negro; approximately half of the white elementary pupils \nwere assigned to schools 86% to 100% white. \nThe Finger Plan. The plan submitted by the court-appointed expert, Dr. Finger, adopted the \nschool board zoning plan for senior high schools with one modification: it required that an \n\nadditional 300 Negro students be transported from the Negro residential area of the city to \nthe nearly all-white Independence High School. \nThe Finger plan for the junior high schools employed much of the rezoning plan of the \nboard, combined with the creation of nine \"satellite\" zones.[3] Under the satellite plan, inner-\ncity Negro students were assigned by attendance zones to nine outlying predominately \nwhite junior high schools, thereby substantially desegregating every junior high school in the \nsystem. \nThe Finger plan departed from the board plan chiefly in its handling of the system's 76 \nelementary schools. Rather than relying solely upon geographic zoning, Dr. Finger \nproposed use of zoning, pairing, and grouping techniques, with the result that student \nbodies throughout the system would range from 9% to 38% Negro.[4] \nThe District Court described the plan thus: \n\"Like the board plan, the Finger plan does as much by rezoning school attendance lines as \ncan reasonably 10*10 be accomplished. However, unlike the board plan, it does not stop \nthere. It goes further and desegregates all the rest of the elementary schools by the \ntechnique of grouping two or three outlying schools with one black inner city school; by \ntransporting black students from grades one through four to the outlying white schools; and \nby transporting white students from the fifth and sixth grades from the outlying white schools \nto the inner city black school.\" \nUnder the Finger plan, nine inner-city Negro schools were grouped in this manner with 24 \nsuburban white schools. \nOn February 5, 1970, the District Court adopted the board plan, as modified by Dr. Finger, \nfor the junior and senior high schools. The court rejected the board elementary school plan \nand adopted the Finger plan as presented. Implementation was partially stayed by the Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on March 5, and this Court declined to disturb the Fourth \nCircuit's order, 397 U. S. 978 (1970). \nOn appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order as to faculty \ndesegregation and the secondary school plans, but vacated the order respecting \nelementary schools. While agreeing that the District Court properly disapproved the board \nplan concerning these schools, the Court of Appeals feared that the pairing and grouping of \nelementary schools would place an unreasonable burden on the board and the system's \npupils. The case was remanded to the District Court for reconsideration and submission of \nfurther plans. 431 F. 2d 11*11 138. This Court granted certiorari, 399 U. S. 926, and directed \nreinstatement of the District Court's order pending further proceedings in that court. \nOn remand the District Court received two new plans for the elementary schools: a plan \nprepared by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (the HEW \nplan) based on contiguous grouping and zoning of schools, and a plan prepared by four \nmembers of the nine-member school board (the minority plan) achieving substantially the \nsame results as the Finger plan but apparently with slightly less transportation. A majority of \nthe school board declined to amend its proposal. After a lengthy evidentiary hearing the \n\nDistrict Court concluded that its own plan (the Finger plan), the minority plan, and an earlier \ndraft of the Finger plan were all reasonable and acceptable. It directed the board to adopt \none of the three or in the alternative to come forward with a new, equally effective plan of its \nown; the court ordered that the Finger plan would remain in effect in the event the school \nboard declined to adopt a new plan. On August 7, the board indicated it would \"acquiesce\" \nin the Finger plan, reiterating its view that the plan was unreasonable. The District Court, by \norder dated August 7, 1970, directed that the Finger plan remain in effect. \nII \nNearly 17 years ago this Court held, in explicit terms, that state-imposed segregation by \nrace in public schools denies equal protection of the laws. At no time has the Court deviated \nin the slightest degree from that holding or its constitutional underpinnings. None of the \nparties before us challenges the Court's decision of May 17, 1954, that \n\"in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate \neducational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, 12*12 we hold that the plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated. . . are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the \nequal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . \n\"Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and \nbecause of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases \npresents problems of considerable complexity.\" Brown v. Board of Education, supra, at 495. \nNone of the parties before us questions the Court's 1955 holding in Brown II, that \n\"School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving \nthese problems; courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities \nconstitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional principles. Because of \ntheir proximity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings, the courts \nwhich originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal. Accordingly, we \nbelieve it appropriate to remand the cases to those courts. \n\"In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. \nTraditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies \nand by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs. These cases call for \nthe exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is the personal interest \nof the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory \nbasis. To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making \nthe transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set \nforth in our May 17, 1954, decision. Courts of 13*13 equity may properly take into account \nthe public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner. \nBut it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be \nallowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.\" Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 349 U. S. 294, 299-300 (1955). \nOver the 16 years since Brown II, many difficulties were encountered in implementation of \nthe basic constitutional requirement that the State not discriminate between public school \nchildren on the basis of their race. Nothing in our national experience prior to 1955 prepared \nanyone for dealing with changes and adjustments of the magnitude and complexity \n\nencountered since then. Deliberate resistance of some to the Court's mandates has \nimpeded the good-faith efforts of others to bring school systems into compliance. The detail \nand nature of these dilatory tactics have been noted frequently by this Court and other \ncourts. \nBy the time the Court considered Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430, in 1968, \nvery little progress had been made in many areas where dual school systems had \nhistorically been maintained by operation of state laws. In Green, the Court was confronted \nwith a record of a freedom-of-choice program that the District Court had found to operate in \nfact to preserve a dual system more than a decade after Brown II. While acknowledging that \na freedom-of-choice concept could be a valid remedial measure in some circumstances, its \nfailure to be effective in Green required that: \n\"The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises \nrealistically to work . . . now . . . until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has been \ncompletely removed.\" Green, supra, at 439. \n14*14 This was plain language, yet the 1969 Term of Court brought fresh evidence of the \ndilatory tactics of many school authorities. Alexander v. Holmes County Board of \nEducation, 396 U. S. 19, restated the basic obligation asserted in Griffin v. School \nBoard, 377 U. S. 218, 234 (1964), and Green, supra, that the remedy must be \nimplemented forthwith. \nThe problems encountered by the district courts and courts of appeals make plain that we \nshould now try to amplify guidelines, however incomplete and imperfect, for the assistance \nof school authorities and courts.[5] The failure of local authorities to meet their constitutional \nobligations aggravated the massive problem of converting from the state-enforced \ndiscrimination of racially separate school systems. This process has been rendered more \ndifficult by changes since 1954 in the structure and patterns of communities, the growth of \nstudent population,[6] movement of families, and other changes, some of which had marked \nimpact on school planning, sometimes neutralizing or negating remedial action before it was \nfully implemented. Rural areas accustomed for half a century to the consolidated school \nsystems implemented by bus transportation could make adjustments more readily than \nmetropolitan areas with dense and shifting population, numerous schools, congested and \ncomplex traffic patterns. \n III \n15*15\nThe objective today remains to eliminate from the public schools all vestiges of state-\nimposed segregation. Segregation was the evil struck down by Brown I as contrary to the \nequal protection guarantees of the Constitution. That was the violation sought to be \ncorrected by the remedial measures of Brown II. That was the basis for the holding \nin Green that school authorities are \"clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take \nwhatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial \ndiscrimination would be eliminated root and branch.\" 391 U. S., at 437-438. \nIf school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under these holdings, judicial authority \nmay be invoked. Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district \n\ncourt's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are \ninherent in equitable remedies. \n\"The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to \nmould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity \nhas distinguished it. The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument \nfor nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well \nas between competing private claims.\" Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329-330 \n(1944), cited in Brown II, supra, at 300. \nThis allocation of responsibility once made, the Court attempted from time to time to provide \nsome guidelines for the exercise of the district judge's discretion and for the reviewing \nfunction of the courts of appeals. However, a school desegregation case does not differ \nfundamentally from other cases involving the framing of 16*16 equitable remedies to repair \nthe denial of a constitutional right. The task is to correct, by a balancing of the individual and \ncollective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution. \nIn seeking to define even in broad and general terms how far this remedial power extends it \nis important to remember that judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a \nconstitutional violation. Remedial judicial authority does not put judges automatically in the \nshoes of school authorities whose powers are plenary. Judicial authority enters only when \nlocal authority defaults. \nSchool authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement \neducational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to \nlive in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white \nstudents reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational \npolicy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities; absent a finding of a \nconstitutional violation, however, that would not be within the authority of a federal court. As \nwith any equity case, the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy. In \ndefault by the school authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies, a district \ncourt has broad power to fashion a remedy that will assure a unitary school system. \nThe school authorities argue that the equity powers of federal district courts have been \nlimited by Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000c. The language and the \nhistory of Title IV show that it was enacted not to limit but to define the role of the Federal \nGovernment in the implementation of the Brown I decision. It authorizes the Commissioner \nof Education to provide technical assistance to local boards in the preparation of \ndesegregation plans, to arrange \"training institutes\" 17*17 for school personnel involved in \ndesegregation efforts, and to make grants directly to schools to ease the transition to unitary \nsystems. It also authorizes the Attorney General, in specified circumstances, to initiate \nfederal desegregation suits. Section 2000c (b) defines \"desegregation\" as it is used in Title \nIV: \n\" `Desegregation' means the assignment of students to public schools and within such \nschools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin, but `desegregation' \nshall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial \nimbalance.\" \n\nSection 2000c-6, authorizing the Attorney General to institute federal suits, contains the \nfollowing proviso: \n\"nothing herein shall empower any official or court of the United States to issue any order \nseeking to achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring the transportation of pupils or \nstudents from one school to another or one school district to another in order to achieve \nsuch racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court to insure \ncompliance with constitutional standards.\" \nOn their face, the sections quoted purport only to insure that the provisions of Title IV of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 will not be read as granting new powers. The proviso in § 2000c-6 \nis in terms designed to foreclose any interpretation of the Act as expanding \nthe existing powers of federal courts to enforce the Equal Protection Clause. There is no \nsuggestion of an intention to restrict those powers or withdraw from courts their historic \nequitable remedial powers. The legislative history of Title IV indicates that Congress was \nconcerned that the Act might be read as creating a right of action under the Fourteenth \nAmendment in the situation of so-called \"de facto segregation,\" where racial imbalance \nexists in the 18*18 schools but with no showing that this was brought about by discriminatory \naction of state authorities. In short, there is nothing in the Act that provides us material \nassistance in answering the question of remedy for state-imposed segregation in violation \nof Brown I. The basis of our decision must be the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment \nthat no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the \nlaws.\" \nIV \nWe turn now to the problem of defining with more particularity the responsibilities of school \nauthorities in desegregating a state-enforced dual school system in light of the Equal \nProtection Clause. Although the several related cases before us are primarily concerned \nwith problems of student assignment, it may be helpful to begin with a brief discussion of \nother aspects of the process. \nIn Green, we pointed out that existing policy and practice with regard to faculty, staff, \ntransportation, extra-curricular activities, and facilities were among the most important \nindicia of a segregated system. 391 U. S., at 435. Independent of student assignment, \nwhere it is possible to identify a \"white school\" or a \"Negro school\" simply by reference to \nthe racial composition of teachers and staff, the quality of school buildings and equipment, \nor the organization of sports activities, a prima facie case of violation of substantive \nconstitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause is shown. \nWhen a system has been dual in these respects, the first remedial responsibility of school \nauthorities is to eliminate invidious racial distinctions. With respect to such matters as \ntransportation, supporting personnel, and extracurricular activities, no more than this may \nbe necessary. Similar corrective action must be taken with regard to the maintenance of \nbuildings and the distribution of equipment. In these areas, normal \nadministrative 19*19 practice should produce schools of like quality, facilities, and staffs. \nSomething more must be said, however, as to faculty assignment and new school \nconstruction. \n\nIn the companion Davis case, post, p. 33, the Mobile school board has argued that the \nConstitution requires that teachers be assigned on a \"color blind\" basis. It also argues that \nthe Constitution prohibits district courts from using their equity power to order assignment of \nteachers to achieve a particular degree of faculty desegregation. We reject that contention. \nIn United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 395 U. S. 225 (1969), the \nDistrict Court set as a goal a plan of faculty assignment in each school with a ratio of white \nto Negro faculty members substantially the same throughout the system. This order was \npredicated on the District Court finding that: \n\"The evidence does not reflect any real administrative problems involved in immediately \ndesegregating the substitute teachers, the student teachers, the night school faculties, and \nin the evolvement of a really legally adequate program for the substantial desegregation of \nthe faculties of all schools in the system commencing with the school year 1968-69.\" \nQuoted at 395 U. S., at 232. \nThe District Court in Montgomery then proceeded to set an initial ratio for the whole system \nof at least two Negro teachers out of each 12 in any given school. The Court of Appeals \nmodified the order by eliminating what it regarded as \"fixed mathematical\" ratios of faculty \nand substituted an initial requirement of \"substantially or approximately\" a five-to-one ratio. \nWith respect to the future, the Court of Appeals held that the numerical ratio should be \neliminated and that compliance should not be tested solely by the achievement of specified \nproportions. Id., at 234. \n20*20 We reversed the Court of Appeals and restored the District Court's order in its \nentirety, holding that the order of the District Judge \n\"was adopted in the spirit of this Court's opinion in Green . . . in that his plan `promises \nrealistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.' The modifications ordered by \nthe panel of the Court of Appeals, while of course not intended to do so, would, we think, \ntake from the order some of its capacity to expedite, by means of specific commands, the \nday when a completely unified, unitary, nondiscriminatory school system becomes a reality \ninstead of a hope. . . . We also believe that under all the circumstances of this case we \nfollow the original plan outlined in Brown II . . . by accepting the more specific and \nexpeditious order of [District] Judge Johnson . . . .\" 395 U. S., at 235-236 (emphasis in \noriginal). \nThe principles of Montgomery have been properly followed by the District Court and the \nCourt of Appeals in this case. \nThe construction of new schools and the closing of old ones are two of the most important \nfunctions of local school authorities and also two of the most complex. They must decide \nquestions of location and capacity in light of population growth, finances, land values, site \navailability, through an almost endless list of factors to be considered. The result of this will \nbe a decision which, when combined with one technique or another of student assignment, \nwill determine the racial composition of the student body in each school in the system. Over \nthe long run, the consequences of the choices will be far reaching. People gravitate toward \nschool facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location \n\nof schools may thus influence 21*21 the patterns of residential development of a \nmetropolitan area and have important impact on composition of inner-city neighborhoods. \nIn the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or \nmaintaining a state-segregated school system. In addition to the classic pattern of building \nschools specifically intended for Negro or white students, school authorities have \nsometimes, since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to become racially mixed \nthrough changes in neighborhood residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied \nby building new schools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro \npopulation centers in order to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum \ndeparture from the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\" Such a policy does more \nthan simply influence the short-run composition of the student body of a new school. It may \nwell promote segregated residential patterns which, when combined with \"neighborhood \nzoning,\" further lock the school system into the mold of separation of the races. Upon a \nproper showing a district court may consider this in fashioning a remedy. \nIn ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school segregation, the existence of a \npattern of school construction and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight. In devising \nremedies where legally imposed segregation has been established, it is the responsibility of \nlocal authorities and district courts to see to it that future school construction and \nabandonment are not used and do not serve to perpetuate or re-establish the dual system. \nWhen necessary, district courts should retain jurisdiction to assure that these \nresponsibilities are carried out. Cf. United States v. Board of Public Instruction, 395 F. 2d 66 \n(CA5 1968); Brewer v. School Board, 397 F. 2d 37 (CA4 1968). \n V \n22*22\nThe central issue in this case is that of student assignment, and there are essentially four \nproblem areas: \n(1) to what extent racial balance or racial quotas may be used as an implement in a \nremedial order to correct a previously segregated system; \n(2) whether every all-Negro and all-white school must be eliminated as an indispensable \npart of a remedial process of desegregation; \n(3) what the limits are, if any, on the rearrangement of school districts and attendance \nzones, as a remedial measure; and \n(4) what the limits are, if any, on the use of transportation facilities to correct state-enforced \nracial school segregation. \n(1) Racial Balances or Racial Quotas. \nThe constant theme and thrust of every holding from Brown I to date is that state-enforced \nseparation of races in public schools is discrimination that violates the Equal Protection \nClause. The remedy commanded was to dismantle dual school systems. \n\nWe are concerned in these cases with the elimination of the discrimination inherent in the \ndual school systems, not with myriad factors of human existence which can cause \ndiscrimination in a multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. The target of the \ncases from Brown I to the present was the dual school system. The elimination of racial \ndiscrimination in public schools is a large task and one that should not be retarded by efforts \nto achieve broader purposes lying beyond the jurisdiction of school authorities. One vehicle \ncan carry only a limited amount of baggage. It would not serve the important objective \nof Brown I to seek to use school desegregation cases for purposes beyond their scope, \nalthough desegregation of schools ultimately will have 23*23 impact on other forms of \ndiscrimination. We do not reach in this case the question whether a showing that school \nsegregation is a consequence of other types of state action, without any discriminatory \naction by the school authorities, is a constitutional violation requiring remedial action by a \nschool desegregation decree. This case does not present that question and we therefore do \nnot decide it. \nOur objective in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see that school \nauthorities exclude no pupil of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly, on \naccount of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the problems of racial prejudice, even \nwhen those problems contribute to disproportionate racial concentrations in some schools. \nIn this case it is urged that the District Court has imposed a racial balance requirement of \n71%-29% on individual schools. The fact that no such objective was actually achieved—and \nwould appear to be impossible— tends to blunt that claim, yet in the opinion and order of \nthe District Court of December 1, 1969, we find that court directing \n\"that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the various schools so that there will \nbe no basis for contending that one school is racially different from the others . . . , [t]hat no \nschool [should] be operated with an all-black or predominantly black student body, [and] \n[t]hat pupils of all grades [should] be assigned in such a way that as nearly as practicable \nthe various schools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of black and \nwhite students.\" \nThe District Judge went on to acknowledge that variation \"from that norm may be \nunavoidable.\" This contains intimations that the \"norm\" is a fixed mathematical 24*24 racial \nbalance reflecting the pupil constituency of the system. If we were to read the holding of the \nDistrict Court to require, as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular degree \nof racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to \nreverse. The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every \nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system \nas a whole. \nAs the voluminous record in this case shows,[7] the predicate for the District Court's use of \nthe 71%-29% ratio was twofold: first, its express finding, approved by the Court of Appeals \nand not challenged here, that a dual school system had been maintained by the school \nauthorities at least until 1969; second, its finding, also approved by the Court of Appeals, \nthat the school board had totally defaulted in its acknowledged duty to come forward with an \nacceptable plan of its own, notwithstanding the patient efforts of the District Judge who, on \nat least three occasions, urged the board to submit plans.[8] As the statement of facts \n\nshows, these findings are abundantly 25*25 supported by the record. It was because of this \ntotal failure of the school board that the District Court was obliged to turn to other qualified \nsources, and Dr. Finger was designated to assist the District Court to do what the board \nshould have done. \nWe see therefore that the use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting \npoint in the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement. From that \nstarting point the District Court proceeded to frame a decree that was within its discretionary \npowers, as an equitable remedy for the particular circumstances.[9] As we said in Green, a \nschool authority's remedial plan or a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its \neffectiveness. Awareness of the racial composition of the whole school system is likely to be \na useful starting point in shaping a remedy to correct past constitutional violations. In sum, \nthe very limited use made of mathematical ratios was within the equitable remedial \ndiscretion of the District Court. \n(2) One-race Schools. \nThe record in this case reveals the familiar phenomenon that in metropolitan areas minority \ngroups are often found concentrated in one part of the city. In some circumstances certain \nschools may remain all or largely of one race until new schools can be provided or \nneighborhood patterns change. Schools all or predominately 26*26 of one race in a district of \nmixed population will require close scrutiny to determine that school assignments are not \npart of state-enforced segregation. \nIn light of the above, it should be clear that the existence of some small number of one-race, \nor virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark of a system that \nstill practices segregation by law. The district judge or school authorities should make every \neffort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation and will thus \nnecessarily be concerned with the elimination of one-race schools. No per se rule can \nadequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the competing interests involved; but in \na system with a history of segregation the need for remedial criteria of sufficient specificity \nto assure a school authority's compliance with its constitutional duty warrants a presumption \nagainst schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition. Where the \nschool authority's proposed plan for conversion from a dual to a unitary system \ncontemplates the continued existence of some schools that are all or predominately of one \nrace, they have the burden of showing that such school assignments are genuinely \nnondiscriminatory. The court should scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the \nschool authorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is not the result of \npresent or past discriminatory action on their part. \nAn optional majority-to-minority transfer provision has long been recognized as a useful part \nof every desegregation plan. Provision for optional transfer of those in the majority racial \ngroup of a particular school to other schools where they will be in the minority is an \nindispensable remedy for those students willing to transfer to other schools in order to \nlessen the impact on them of the state-imposed stigma of segregation. In order to be \neffective, such a transfer arrangement must grant 27*27 the transferring student free \ntransportation and space must be made available in the school to which he desires to move. \n\nCf. Ellis v. Board of Public Instruction, 423 F. 2d 203, 206 (CA5 1970). The court orders in \nthis and the companion Davis case now provide such an option. \n(3) Remedial Altering of Attendance Zones. \nThe maps submitted in these cases graphically demonstrate that one of the principal tools \nemployed by school planners and by courts to break up the dual school system has been a \nfrank—and sometimes drastic—gerry-mandering of school districts and attendance zones. \nAn additional step was pairing, \"clustering,\" or \"grouping\" of schools with attendance \nassignments made deliberately to accomplish the transfer of Negro students out of formerly \nsegregated Negro schools and transfer of white students to formerly all-Negro schools. \nMore often than not, these zones are neither compact[10] nor contiguous; indeed they may \nbe on opposite ends of the city. As an interim corrective measure, this cannot be said to be \nbeyond the broad remedial powers of a court. \n28*28 Absent a constitutional violation there would be no basis for judicially ordering \nassignment of students on a racial basis. All things being equal, with no history of \ndiscrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes. \nBut all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and \nmaintained to enforce racial segregation. The remedy for such segregation may be \nadministratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may \nimpose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the \ninterim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school \nsystems. \nNo fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can \ngo, but it must be recognized that there are limits. The objective is to dismantle the dual \nschool system. \"Racially neutral\" assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a \ndistrict court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of \npast school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of \nschool size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation. When school \nauthorities present a district court with a \"loaded game board,\" affirmative action in the form \nof remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to achieve truly nondiscriminatory \nassignments. In short, an assignment plan is not acceptable simply because it appears to \nbe neutral. \nIn this area, we must of necessity rely to a large extent, as this Court has for more than 16 \nyears, on the informed judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of \nappeals. \nWe hold that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school zones is a permissible tool \nand such action is to be considered in light of the objectives sought. Judicial 29*29 steps in \nshaping such zones going beyond combinations of contiguous areas should be examined in \nlight of what is said in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this opinion concerning the objectives \nto be sought. Maps do not tell the whole story since noncontiguous school zones may be \nmore accessible to each other in terms of the critical travel time, because of traffic patterns \nand good highways, than schools geographically closer together. Conditions in different \nlocalities will vary so widely that no rigid rules can be laid down to govern all situations. \n\n(4) Transportation of Students. \nThe scope of permissible transportation of students as an implement of a remedial decree \nhas never been defined by this Court and by the very nature of the problem it cannot be \ndefined with precision. No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for \napplication to the infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of situations. Bus \ntransportation has been an integral part of the public education system for years, and was \nperhaps the single most important factor in the transition from the one-room schoolhouse to \nthe consolidated school. Eighteen million of the Nation's public school children, \napproximately 39%, were transported to their schools by bus in 1969-1970 in all parts of the \ncountry. \nThe importance of bus transportation as a normal and accepted tool of educational policy is \nreadily discernible in this and the companion case, Davis, supra.[11] The 30*30 Charlotte \nschool authorities did not purport to assign students on the basis of geographically drawn \nzones until 1965 and then they allowed almost unlimited transfer privileges. The District \nCourt's conclusion that assignment of children to the school nearest their home serving their \ngrade would not produce an effective dismantling of the dual system is supported by the \nrecord. \nThus the remedial techniques used in the District Court's order were within that court's \npower to provide equitable relief; implementation of the decree is well within the capacity of \nthe school authority. \nThe decree provided that the buses used to implement the plan would operate on direct \nroutes. Students would be picked up at schools near their homes and transported to the \nschools they were to attend. The trips for elementary school pupils average about seven \nmiles and the District Court found that they would take \"not over 35 minutes at the \nmost.\"[12] This system compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated \nin Charlotte under which each day 23,600 students on all grade levels were transported an \naverage of 15 miles one way for an average trip requiring over an hour. In these \ncircumstances, we find no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not be \nrequired to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation. Desegregation \nplans cannot be limited to the walk-in school. \nAn objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of \ntravel is so great as to either risk the health of the children or significantly 31*31 impinge on \nthe educational process. District courts must weigh the soundness of any transportation \nplan in light of what is said in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) above. It hardly needs stating \nthat the limits on time of travel will vary with many factors, but probably with none more than \nthe age of the students. The reconciliation of competing values in a desegregation case is, \nof course, a difficult task with many sensitive facets but fundamentally no more so than \nremedial measures courts of equity have traditionally employed. \nVI \n\nThe Court of Appeals, searching for a term to define the equitable remedial power of the \ndistrict courts, used the term \"reasonableness.\" In Green, supra, this Court used the term \n\"feasible\" and by implication, \"workable,\" \"effective,\" and \"realistic\" in the mandate to \ndevelop \"a plan that promises realistically to work, and . . . to work now.\" On the facts of this \ncase, we are unable to conclude that the order of the District Court is not reasonable, \nfeasible and workable. However, in seeking to define the scope of remedial power or the \nlimits on remedial power of courts in an area as sensitive as we deal with here, words are \npoor instruments to convey the sense of basic fairness inherent in equity. Substance, not \nsemantics, must govern, and we have sought to suggest the nature of limitations without \nfrustrating the appropriate scope of equity. \nAt some point, these school authorities and others like them should have achieved full \ncompliance with this Court's decision in Brown I. The systems would then be \"unitary\" in the \nsense required by our decisions in Green and Alexander. \nIt does not follow that the communities served by such systems will remain demographically \nstable, for in a growing, mobile society, few will do so. Neither 32*32 school authorities nor \ndistrict courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial \ncomposition of student bodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been \naccomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the system. \nThis does not mean that federal courts are without power to deal with future problems; but \nin the absence of a showing that either the school authorities or some other agency of the \nState has deliberately attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial \ncomposition of the schools, further intervention by a district court should not be necessary. \nFor the reasons herein set forth, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed as to \nthose parts in which it affirmed the judgment of the District Court. The order of the District \nCourt, dated August 7, 1970, is also affirmed. \nIt is so ordered. \n[*] Together with No. 349, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education et al. v. Swann et al., also on certiorari to the \nsame court. \n[1] McDaniel v. Barresi, No. 420, post, p. 39; Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, No. \n436, post, p. 33; Moore v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, No. 444, post, p. 47; North Carolina State \nBoard of Education v. Swann, No. 498, post, p. 43. For purposes of this opinion the cross-petitions in Nos. 281 and \n349 are treated as a single case and will be referred to as \"this case.\" \n[2] Raney v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 443 (1968), and Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U. S. 450 \n(1968). \n[3] A \"satellite zone\" is an area which is not contiguous with the main attendance zone surrounding the school. \n[4] In its opinion and order of December 1, 1969, later incorporated in the order appointing Dr. Finger as consultant, \nthe District Court stated: \n\"Fixed ratios of pupils in particular schools will not be set. If the board in one of its three tries had presented a plan for \ndesegregation, the court would have sought ways to approve variations in pupil ratios. In default of any such plan \nfrom the school board, the court will start with the thought . . . that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the \n\nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school is racially different from the others, but to \nunderstand that variations from that norm may be unavoidable.\" 306 F. Supp. 1299, 1312. \n[5] The necessity for this is suggested by the situation in the Fifth Circuit where 166 appeals in school desegregation \ncases were heard between December 2, 1969, and September 24, 1970. \n[6] Elementary public school population (grades 1-6) grew from 17,447,000 in 1954 to 23,103,000 in 1969; secondary \nschool population (beyond grade 6) grew from 11,183,000 in 1954 to 20,775,000 in 1969. Digest of Educational \nStatistics, Table 3, Office of Education Pub. 10024-64; Digest of Educational Statistics, Table 28, Office of Education \nPub. 10024-70. \n[7] It must be remembered that the District Court entered nearly a score of orders and numerous sets of findings, and \nfor the most part each was accompanied by a memorandum opinion. Considering the pressure under which the court \nwas obliged to operate we would not expect that all inconsistencies and apparent inconsistencies could be avoided. \nOur review, of course, is on the orders of February 5, 1970, as amended, and August 7, 1970. \n[8] The final board plan left 10 schools 86% to 100% Negro and yet categorically rejected the techniques of pairing \nand clustering as part of the desegregation effort. As discussed below, the Charlotte board was under an obligation to \nexercise every reasonable effort to remedy the violation, once it was identified, and the suggested techniques are \npermissible remedial devices. Additionally, as noted by the District Court and Court of Appeals, the board plan did not \nassign white students to any school unless the student population of that school was at least 60% white. This was an \narbitrary limitation negating reasonable remedial steps. \n[9] In its August 3, 1970, memorandum holding that the District Court plan was \"reasonable\" under the standard laid \ndown by the Fourth Circuit on appeal, the District Court explained the approach taken as follows: \n\"This court has not ruled, and does not rule that `racial balance' is required under the Constitution; nor that all black \nschools in all cities are unlawful; nor that all school boards must bus children or violate the Constitution; nor that the \nparticular order entered in this case would be correct in other circumstances not before this court.\" (Emphasis in \noriginal.) \n[10] The reliance of school authorities on the reference to the \"revision of . . . attendance areas \ninto compact units,\" Brown II, at 300 (emphasis supplied), is misplaced. The enumeration in that opinion of \nconsiderations to be taken into account by district courts was patently intended to be suggestive rather than \nexhaustive. The decision in Brown II to remand the cases decided in Brown I to local courts for the framing of specific \ndecrees was premised on a recognition that this Court could not at that time foresee the particular means which \nwould be required to implement the constitutional principles announced. We said in Green, supra, at 439: \n\"The obligation of the district courts, as it always has been, is to assess the effectiveness of a proposed plan in \nachieving desegregation. There is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously no \none plan that will do the job in every case. The matter must be assessed in light of the circumstances present and the \noptions available in each instance.\" \n[11] During 1967-1968, for example, the Mobile board used 207 buses to transport 22,094 students daily for an \naverage round trip of 31 miles. During 1966-1967, 7,116 students in the metropolitan area were bused daily. In \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, the system as a whole, without regard to desegregation plans, planned to bus approximately \n23,000 students this year, for an average daily round trip of 15 miles. More elementary school children than high \nschool children were to be bused, and four- and five-year-olds travel the longest routes in the system. \n[12] The District Court found that the school system would have to employ 138 more buses than it had previously \noperated. But 105 of those buses were already available and the others could easily be obtained. Additionally, it \nshould be noted that North Carolina requires provision of transportation for all students who are assigned to schools \nmore than one and one-half miles from their homes. N. C.
