    "summary": "<p>On Dec. 3, 1997, an applicant to the University of Michigan Law School brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the University of Michigan Law School. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, claimed that, in denying her admission, the school discriminated against her on the basis of her race, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. She claimed that the school used the race of its applicants not merely as a plus factor in determining admission, but as one of the predominant factors. Moreover, she claimed, the school had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process, nor did they ever employ any race-neutral alternatives. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On Jan. 7, 1999, the Court (Judge Bernard A. Friedman) certified the class. </p><p>In March 2001, after a bench trial, Judge Friedman ruled for Grutter and determined that the law school's admissions policy was unconstitutional. By using race to ensure the enrollment of a certain minimum percentage of underrepresented minorities, the court held, the law school had \"made the current admissions policy practically indistinguishable from a[n unconstitutional] quota system.\" 137 F. Supp. 2d 821. The district court also concluded that the achievement of racial diversity is not a compelling state interest.</p><p>The law school appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which heard the appeal en banc. On May 14, 2002, the court (Chief Judge Boyce F. Martin, Jr. wrote the majority opinion) reversed the district court. The court held (1) that the Supreme Court had established in <i> Bakke </i> that achieving a diverse student body was a compelling interest, and (2) that the school's policy was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. 288 F.3d 732. </p><p>Grutter petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, which granted it in December 2002. On June 23, 2003, the Court affirmed the 6th Circuit decision, and held that the law school's desire to obtain a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students counted as a narrowly tailored use of race in its admissions process. Moreover, the Court held, the school's use of race furthered its compelling interest in \"obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\" Because the law school engaged in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant, giving serious consideration to all the ways the applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment, it ensured that all factors that could contribute to diversity were meaningfully considered alongside race. Its admissions process was not unconstitutional. </p><p>The majority opinion (written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer) did note that affirmative action should not be allowed to exist forever, but, rather, that at some future date (the opinion mentions 25 years hence), only colorblind policies should be allowed. </p><p>Justice Thomas issued an opinion concurring only with the majority opinion's implication of a 25-year window of affirmative-action legitimacy. He dissented from the rest of the opinion, stating that the law school had no compelling interest in maintaining an elite, but racially diverse, campus. If the school wanted to achieve greater diversity, he wrote, it could relax its test score and GPA requirements.</p><p>On March 17, 2004, Judge Friedman ordered the case closed.</p><p></p>",

She claimed that, in denying her admission, the school discriminated against her on the basis of her race, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which held that the law school's desire to obtain a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students counted as a narrowly tailored use of race in its admissions process and was not unconstitutional.",

Kolbo argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were David F. Herr, R. Lawrence Purdy, Michael C. McCarthy, Michael E. Rosman, Hans\nBader, and Kerry L. Morgan.\nSolicitor General Olson argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney General Boyd\nand Deputy Solicitor General Clement.\nMaureen E. Mahoney argued the cause for respondent Bollinger et al. With her on the brief were John H. Pickering, John Payton, Brigida Benitez, Craig\nGoldblatt, Terry A. Maroney, Marvin Krislov, Jonathan Alger, Evan Caminker, Philip J. Kessler, and Leonard M. Niehoff.\nMiranda K. S. Massie and George B. Washington filed a brief for respondent James et al.[*]\n311 *311 JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis case requires us to decide whether the use of race as a factor in student admissions by the University of Michigan Law School (Law School) is unlawful.\n312  I\n*312\nA\n313 The Law School ranks among the Nation's top law schools. It receives more than 3,500 applications each year for a class *313 of around 350 students.\nSeeking to \"admit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable,\" the Law School looks for individuals with \"substantial\n314 *314 promise for success in law school\" and \"a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-being of\nothers.\" App. 110. More broadly, the Law School seeks \"a mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each\nother.\" Ibid. In 1992, the dean of the Law School charged a faculty committee with crafting a written admissions policy to implement these goals. In particular,\nthe Law School sought to ensure that its efforts to achieve student body diversity complied with this Court's most recent ruling on the use of race in university\n315 admissions. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). *315 Upon the unanimous adoption of the committee's report by the Law School\nfaculty, it became the Law School's official admissions policy.\nThe hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants' talents, experiences, and potential \"to contribute to\nthe learning of those around them.\" App. 111. The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the\nfile, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity\nof the Law School. Id., at 83-84, 114-121. In reviewing an applicant's file, admissions officials must consider the applicant's undergraduate grade point average\n(GPA) and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school. Id., at 112. The\npolicy stresses that \"no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.\" Id., at\n111.\nThe policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law School. Id., at 113. Nor does a low score\nautomatically disqualify an applicant. Ibid. Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are\nimportant to the Law School's educational objectives. Id., at 114. So-called \"`soft' variables\" such as \"the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the\nundergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection\" are all brought to bear in\nassessing an \"applicant's likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.\" Ibid.\nThe policy aspires to \"achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone's education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of\n\n316 its parts.\" Id., at 118. *316 The policy does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for \"substantial weight\" in the admissions process, but instead\nrecognizes \"many possible bases for diversity admissions.\" Id., at 118, 120. The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School's longstanding commitment to\n\"one particular type of diversity,\" that is, \"racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically\ndiscriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in\nmeaningful numbers.\" Id., at 120. By enrolling a \"`critical mass' of [underrepresented] minority students,\" the Law School seeks to \"ensur[e] their ability to\nmake unique contributions to the character of the Law School.\" Id., at 120-121.\nThe policy does not define diversity \"solely in terms of racial and ethnic status.\" Id., at 121. Nor is the policy \"insensitive to the competition among all students\nfor admission to the [L]aw [S]chool.\" Ibid. Rather, the policy seeks to guide admissions officers in \"producing classes both diverse and academically\noutstanding, classes made up of students who promise to continue the tradition of outstanding contribution by Michigan Graduates to the legal profession.\"\nIbid.\nB\nPetitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score. The Law School initially\nplaced petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application. In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994, and\nPresident of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law\n317 School from 1991 *317 until 1998). Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. § 2000d; and Rev. Stat. § 1977, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1981.\nPetitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a \"predominant\" factor, giving applicants who belong to\ncertain minority groups \"a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.\" App. 33-34. Petitioner\nalso alleged that respondents \"had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process.\" Id., at 34. Petitioner requested compensatory\nand punitive damages, an order requiring the Law School to offer her admission, and an injunction prohibiting the Law School from continuing to discriminate\non the basis of race. Id., at 36. Petitioner clearly has standing to bring this lawsuit. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v.\nJacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993).\nThe District Court granted petitioner's motion for class certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and damages phases. The class was defined as\n\"`all persons who (A) applied for and were not granted admission to the University of Michigan Law School for the academic years since (and including) 1995\nuntil the time that judgment is entered herein; and (B) were members of those racial or ethnic groups, including Caucasian, that Defendants treated less\nfavorably in considering their applications for admission to the Law School.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a-192a.\nThe District Court heard oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000. Taking the motions under advisement, the\nDistrict Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law School's asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a\n318 diverse student body was compelling. *318 The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the\nLaw School's admissions decisions, and whether the Law School's consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.\nDuring the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law School's use of race in the admissions process. Dennis Shields,\nDirector of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority\nstudents, but rather to consider an applicant's race along with all other factors. Id., at 206a. Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he\nwould frequently consult the so-called \"daily reports\" that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as\nresidency status and gender). Id., at 207a. This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be\nreached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Ibid. Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number\nor percentage of underrepresented minority students. Ibid.\nErica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that \"`critical mass'\" means \"`meaningful numbers'\" or \"`meaningful representation,'\"\nwhich she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated. Id., at\n208a-209a. Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass. Id., at 209a. Munzel also asserted\nthat she must consider the race of applicants because a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could not be enrolled if admissions decisions were\nbased primarily on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores. Ibid.\n319 The current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also testified. Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did *319 not quantify critical mass in terms\nof numbers or percentages. Id., at 211a. He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or\nlike spokespersons for their race. Ibid. When asked about the extent to which race is considered in admissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one\napplicant to another. Ibid. In some cases, according to Lehman's testimony, an applicant's race may play no role, while in others it may be a \"`determinative'\"\nfactor. Ibid.\nThe District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy. Lempert\nemphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience\nboth inside and outside the classroom. Id., at 213a. When asked about the policy's \"`commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the\ninclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,'\" Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past\ndiscrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the\nvictims of such discrimination. Ibid. Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they\n\nwere not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers.\nIbid.\nKent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law School's use of race in admissions decisions. Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the\n1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School. In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports\n320 on the educational benefits of diversity. Syverud's testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, *320 racial\nstereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no \"`minority viewpoint'\" but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students.\nId., at 215a.\nIn an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous\nevidence at trial. Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioner's expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed \"admissions grids\" for the years\nin question (1995-2000). These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores. Dr. Larntz\nmade \"`cell-by-cell'\" comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and\nadmission rates. He concluded that membership in certain minority groups \"`is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,'\" and that applicants\nfrom these minority groups \"`are given an extremely large allowance for admission'\" as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups. Id., at\n218a-220a. Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law School's admissions calculus. 12 Tr. 11-13 (Feb. 10, 2001).\nDr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law School's expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law School's admission process. In\nDr. Raudenbush's view, a race-blind admissions system would have a \"`very dramatic,'\" negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 223a. He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted. Ibid. Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were\nnot considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted. Ibid. Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have\nconstituted 4 percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5 percent. Ibid.\n321 *321 In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law School's use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful. Applying strict scrutiny, the\nDistrict Court determined that the Law School's asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because \"the attainment of a\nracially diverse class . . . was not recognized as such by Bakke and it is not a remedy for past discrimination.\" Id., at 246a. The District Court went on to hold\nthat even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest. The District Court granted petitioner's\nrequest for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions. The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the\ninjunction pending appeal.\nSitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powell's\nopinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest. According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powell's opinion with\nrespect to diversity constituted the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188\n(1977). The Court of Appeals also held that the Law School's use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a \"potential `plus' factor\" and\nbecause the Law School's program was \"virtually identical\" to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his\nBakke opinion. 288 F. 3d 732, 746, 749 (CA6 2002).\nFour dissenting judges would have held the Law School's use of race unconstitutional. Three of the dissenters, rejecting the majority's Marks analysis,\nexamined the Law School's interest in student body diversity on the merits and concluded it was not compelling. The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found\n322 it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, *322 he believed that the Law School's use of race\nwas not narrowly tailored to further that interest.\nWe granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1043 (2002), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on a question of national importance: Whether\ndiversity is a compelling interest that can justify the narrowly tailored use of race in selecting applicants for admission to public universities. Compare Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996) (Hopwood I) (holding that diversity is not a compelling state interest), with Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233 F.\n3d 1188 (CA9 2000) (holding that it is).\nII\nA\nWe last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago. In the landmark Bakke case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that\nreserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. 438 U. S. 265 (1978). The decision produced six separate\nopinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court. Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the\ngovernment can use race to \"remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.\" Id., at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and\nBlackmun, concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the\nprogram on statutory grounds. Id., at 408 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and REHNQUIST, JJ., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for reversing the state court's injunction\nagainst any use of race whatsoever. The only holding for the Court in Bakke was that a \"State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a\n323 properly devised admissions program involving *323 the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.\" Id., at 320. Thus, we reversed that part of the\nlower court's judgment that enjoined the university \"from any consideration of the race of any applicant.\" Ibid.\nSince this Court's splintered decision in Bakke, Justice Powell's opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional\nanalysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice\n\nPowell's views on permissible race-conscious policies. See, e. g., Brief for Judith Areen et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13 (law school admissions programs employ\n\"methods designed from and based on Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke\"); Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 27 (\"After Bakke, each of the amici\n(and undoubtedly other selective colleges and universities as well) reviewed their admissions procedures in light of Justice Powell's opinion . . . and set sail\naccordingly\"). We therefore discuss Justice Powell's opinion in some detail.\nJustice Powell began by stating that \"[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when\napplied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.\" Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290. In Justice Powell's view,\nwhen governmental decisions \"touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to\nbear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\" Id., at 299. Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests\nasserted by the university survived Justice Powell's scrutiny.\nFirst, Justice Powell rejected an interest in \"`reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession' \"\n324 as an unlawful interest in racial balancing. Id., at 306-307. Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination *324 because such\nmeasures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties \"who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special\nadmissions program are thought to have suffered.\" Id., at 310. Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in \"increasing the number of physicians who will\npractice in communities currently underserved,\" concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review\nwas not \"geared to promote that goal.\" Id., at 306, 310.\nJustice Powell approved the university's use of race to further only one interest: \"the attainment of a diverse student body.\" Id., at 311. With the important\nproviso that \"constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded,\" Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic freedom that\n\"long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" Id., at 312, 314. Justice Powell emphasized that nothing less than the \"`nation's future\ndepends upon leaders trained through wide exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.\" Id., at 313 (quoting\nKeyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967)). In seeking the \"right to select those students who will contribute the most\nto the `robust exchange of ideas,' \" a university seeks \"to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\" 438 U. S., at 313.\nBoth \"tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.\" Ibid.\nJustice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view race \"is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in\nattaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.\" Id., at 314. For Justice Powell, \"[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified\n325 percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,\" that *325 can justify the use of race. Id., at 315. Rather, \"[t]he\ndiversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a\nsingle though important element.\" Ibid.\nIn the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke, courts have struggled to discern whether Justice Powell's diversity rationale, set forth in part of the opinion\njoined by no other Justice, is nonetheless binding precedent under Marks. In that case, we explained that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no\nsingle rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\" 430 U. S., at 193 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the divergent opinions of the lower\ncourts demonstrate, however, \"[t]his test is more easily stated than applied to the various opinions supporting the result in [Bakke].\" Nichols v. United States,\n511 U. S. 738, 745-746 (1994). Compare, e. g., Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001) (Justice Powell's diversity rationale\nwas not the holding of the Court); Hopwood v. Texas, 236 F. 3d 256, 274-275 (CA5 2000) (Hopwood II) (same); Hopwood I, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996) (same),\nwith Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233 F. 3d, at 1199 (Justice Powell's opinion, including the diversity rationale, is controlling under Marks).\nWe do not find it necessary to decide whether Justice Powell's opinion is binding under Marks. It does not seem \"useful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the\nutmost logical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courts that have considered it.\" Nichols v. United States, supra, at 745-746.\nMore important, for the reasons set out below, today we endorse Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify\nthe use of race in university admissions.\n326  B\n*326\nThe Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §\n2. Because the Fourteenth Amendment \"protect[s] persons, not groups,\" all \"governmental action based on race—a group classification long recognized as in\nmost circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited—should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of\nthe laws has not been infringed.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). We are a \"free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). It follows from that principle that \"government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling\nreasons.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S., at 227.\nWe have held that all racial classifications imposed by government \"must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\" Ibid. This means that such\nclassifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests. \"Absent searching judicial inquiry into the\njustification for such race-based measures,\" we have no way to determine what \"classifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact\nmotivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). We\napply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to \"`smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to\nwarrant use of a highly suspect tool.\" Ibid.\nStrict scrutiny is not \"strict in theory, but fatal in fact.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, supra, at 237 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n327 Although all governmental *327 uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. As we have explained, \"whenever the government treats\nany person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's\nguarantee of equal protection.\" 515 U. S., at 229-230. But that observation \"says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is\nthe job of the court applying strict scrutiny.\" Id., at 230. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does\nnot violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.\nContext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344 (1960)\n(admonishing that, \"in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and\nexclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in\ndisregard of variant controlling facts\"). In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, we made clear that strict scrutiny must take \"`relevant differences' into account.\"\n515 U. S., at 228. Indeed, as we explained, that is its \"fundamental purpose.\" Ibid. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict\nscrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental\ndecisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\nIII\nA\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law School's use of race is justified by a compelling state interest. Before this Court, as they\n328 have *328 throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining \"the educational benefits\nthat flow from a diverse student body.\" Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. i. In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher\neducation, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.\nWe first wish to dispel the notion that the Law School's argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided\nsince Bakke. It is true that some language in those opinions might be read to suggest that remedying past discrimination is the only permissible justification for\nrace-based governmental action. See, e. g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race\nare \"strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility\"). But we have never held\nthat the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination. Nor, since Bakke, have we directly addressed the use\nof race in the context of public higher education. Today, we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.\nThe Law School's educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer. The Law School's assessment that\ndiversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no\nless strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university. Our holding today is in\nkeeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions, within constitutionally prescribed limits. See Regents of Univ. of\n329 Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225 (1985); Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo. *329 v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 96, n. 6 (1978); Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53\n(opinion of Powell, J.).\nWe have long recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the\nuniversity environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition. See, e. g., Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (1952)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479, 487 (1960); Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S., at 603. In announcing the principle of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice Powell invoked\nour cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational autonomy: \"The freedom of a university to make its own\njudgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.\" Bakke, supra, at 312. From this premise, Justice Powell reasoned that by claiming \"the\nright to select those students who will contribute the most to the `robust exchange of ideas,'\" a university \"seek[s] to achieve a goal that is of paramount\nimportance in the fulfillment of its mission.\" 438 U. S., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., supra, at 603). Our conclusion\nthat the Law School has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law\nSchool's proper institutional mission, and that \"good faith\" on the part of a university is \"presumed\" absent \"a showing to the contrary.\" 438 U. S., at 318-319.\nAs part of its goal of \"assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse,\" the Law School seeks to \"enroll a `critical mass'\nof minority students.\" Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 13. The Law School's interest is not simply \"to assure within its student body some specified\n330 percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.\" Bakke, 438 U. S., at *330 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). That would amount to\noutright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional. Ibid.; Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992) (\"Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own\nsake\"); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 507. Rather, the Law School's concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits\nthat diversity is designed to produce.\nThese benefits are substantial. As the District Court emphasized, the Law School's admissions policy promotes \"cross-racial understanding,\" helps to break\ndown racial stereotypes, and \"enables [students] to better understand persons of different races.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 246a. These benefits are \"important\nand laudable,\" because \"classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting\" when the students have \"the greatest\npossible variety of backgrounds.\" Id., at 246a, 244a.\nThe Law School's claim of a compelling interest is further bolstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity. In\naddition to the expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and\n\"better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals.\" Brief for American Educational\n\nResearch Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3; see, e. g., W. Bowen & D. Bok, The Shape of the River (1998); Diversity Challenged: Evidence on the Impact of\nAffirmative Action (G. Orfield & M. Kurlaender eds. 2001); Compelling Interest: Examining the Evidence on Racial Dynamics in Colleges and Universities (M.\nChang, D. Witt, J. Jones, & K. Hakuta eds. 2003).\nThese benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace\n331 can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. Brief for 3M et al. as Amici Curiae *331 5; Brief for General\nMotors Corp. as Amicus Curiae 3-4. What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, \"[b]ased on [their]\ndecades of experience,\" a \"highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential to the military's ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national\nsecurity.\" Brief for Julius W. Becton, Jr., et al. as Amici Curiae 5. The primary sources for the Nation's officer corps are the service academies and the Reserve\nOfficers Training Corps (ROTC), the latter comprising students already admitted to participating colleges and universities. Ibid. At present, \"the military cannot\nachieve an officer corps that is both highly qualified and racially diverse unless the service academies and the ROTC used limited race-conscious recruiting\nand admissions policies.\" Ibid. (emphasis in original). To fulfill its mission, the military \"must be selective in admissions for training and education for the officer\ncorps, and it must train and educate a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse educational setting.\" Id., at 29 (emphasis in original).\nWe agree that \"[i]t requires only a small step from this analysis to conclude that our country's other most selective institutions must remain both diverse and\nselective.\" Ibid.\nWe have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to \"sustaining our\npolitical and cultural heritage\" with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 221 (1982). This Court has long\nrecognized that \"education. . . is the very foundation of good citizenship.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 493 (1954). For this reason, the\ndiffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The\n332 United States, as amicus curiae, affirms that \"[e]nsuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American *332 society, including\npeople of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13. And, \"[n]owhere is the\nimportance of such openness more acute than in the context of higher education.\" Ibid. Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the\ncivic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.\nMoreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation's leaders. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629,\n634 (1950) (describing law school as a \"proving ground for legal learning and practice\"). Individuals with law degrees occupy roughly half the state\ngovernorships, more than half the seats in the United States Senate, and more than a third of the seats in the United States House of Representatives. See\nBrief for Association of American Law Schools as Amicus Curiae 5-6. The pattern is even more striking when it comes to highly selective law schools. A\nhandful of these schools accounts for 25 of the 100 United States Senators, 74 United States Courts of Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of the more than 600\nUnited States District Court judges. Id., at 6.\nIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and\nqualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and integrity of the\neducational institutions that provide this training. As we have recognized, law schools \"cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with\nwhich the law interacts.\" See Sweatt v. Painter, supra, at 634. Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and\n333 qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society *333 may participate in the educational institutions that\nprovide the training and education necessary to succeed in America.\nThe Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on \"any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic\nminority viewpoint on any issue.\" Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30. To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the\nLaw School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having\nparticular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our\nown, in which race unfortunately still matters. The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a \"critical mass\" of\nunderrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\nB\nEven in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to further a compelling state interest, government is still \"constrained in how it\nmay pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government's] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that\npurpose.\" Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensure\nthat \"the means chosen `fit' th[e] compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial\nprejudice or stereotype.\" Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 493 (plurality opinion).\nSince Bakke, we have had no occasion to define the contours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs.\n334 That inquiry *334 must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student body diversity in public higher education. Contrary to\nJUSTICE KENNEDY'S assertions, we do not \"abando[n] strict scrutiny,\" see post, at 394 (dissenting opinion). Rather, as we have already explained, supra, at\n327, we adhere to Adarand's teaching that the very purpose of strict scrutiny is to take such \"relevant differences into account.\" 515 U. S., at 228 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\nTo be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system—it cannot \"insulat[e] each category of applicants with certain\ndesired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.\" Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, a university may consider race or\nethnicity only as a \"`plus' in a particular applicant's file,\" without \"insulat[ing] the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.\"\nId., at 317. In other words, an admissions program must be \"flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications\n\nof each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.\" Ibid.\nWe find that the Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke, truly individualized\nconsideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonmechanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members\nof certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. See id., at 315-316. Nor can universities insulate applicants who\nbelong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Ibid. Universities can, however, consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a \"plus\"\nfactor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant. Ibid.\n335 *335 We are satisfied that the Law School's admissions program, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell, does not operate as a quota. Properly\nunderstood, a \"quota\" is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are \"reserved exclusively for certain minority groups.\"\nRichmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 496 (plurality opinion). Quotas \"`impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be\nexceeded,'\" Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 495 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and \"insulate the individual\nfrom comparison with all other candidates for the available seats,\" Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). In contrast, \"a permissible goal.. . require[s] only\na good-faith effort . . . to come within a range demarcated by the goal itself,\" Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, supra, at 495, and permits consideration of race\nas a \"plus\" factor in any given case while still ensuring that each candidate \"compete[s] with all other qualified applicants,\" Johnson v. Transportation Agency,\nSanta Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 638 (1987).\nJustice Powell's distinction between the medical school's rigid 16-seat quota and Harvard's flexible use of race as a \"plus\" factor is instructive. Harvard\ncertainly had minimum goals for minority enrollment, even if it had no specific number firmly in mind. See Bakke, supra, at 323 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\"10 or 20\nblack students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United\nStates\"). What is more, Justice Powell flatly rejected the argument that Harvard's program was \"the functional equivalent of a quota\" merely because it had\nsome \"`plus' \" for race, or gave greater \"weight\" to race than to some other factors, in order to achieve student body diversity. 438 U. S., at 317-318.\n336 The Law School's goal of attaining a critical mass of under-represented minority students does not transform its program *336 into a quota. As the Harvard\nplan described by Justice Powell recognized, there is of course \"some relationship between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse\nstudent body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted.\" Id., at 323. \"[S]ome attention to numbers,\" without\nmore, does not transform a flexible admissions system into a rigid quota. Ibid. Nor, as JUSTICE KENNEDY posits, does the Law School's consultation of the\n\"daily reports,\" which keep track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (as well as of residency and gender), \"sugges[t] there was no further attempt\nat individual review save for race itself\" during the final stages of the admissions process. See post, at 392 (dissenting opinion). To the contrary, the Law\nSchool's admissions officers testified without contradiction that they never gave race any more or less weight based on the information contained in these\nreports. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 43, n. 70 (citing App. in Nos. 01-1447 and 01-1516 (CA6), p. 7336). Moreover, as Justice Kennedy concedes, see\npost, at 390, between 1993 and 1998, the number of African-American, Latino, and Native-American students in each class at the Law School varied from 13.5\nto 20.1 percent, a range inconsistent with a quota.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE believes that the Law School's policy conceals an attempt to achieve racial balancing, and cites admissions data to contend that the\nLaw School discriminates among different groups within the critical mass. Post, at 380-386 (dissenting opinion). But, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE concedes, the\nnumber of underrepresented minority students who ultimately enroll in the Law School differs substantially from their representation in the applicant pool and\nvaries considerably for each group from year to year. See post, at 385 (dissenting opinion).\nThat a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration. When using\n337 race as a \"plus\" *337 factor in university admissions, a university's admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated\nas an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant's race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application. The importance of this individualized\nconsideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount. See Bakke, 438 U. S., at 318, n. 52 (opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the\n\"denial... of th[e] right to individualized consideration\" as the \"principal evil\" of the medical school's admissions program).\nHere, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might\ncontribute to a diverse educational environment. The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races. There is no policy, either de\njure or de facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single \"soft\" variable. Unlike the program at issue in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 244, the\nLaw School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity \"bonuses\" based on race or ethnicity. See ante, at 271-272 (distinguishing a race-conscious\nadmissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but \"did not contemplate that any single\ncharacteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity\"). Like the Harvard plan, the Law School's admissions\npolicy \"is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same\nfooting for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.\" Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.).\nWe also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in Bakke, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all\n338 factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions. With respect *338 to the use of race\nitself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified. By virtue of our Nation's struggle with racial inequality,\nsuch students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law School's mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers\non criteria that ignore those experiences. See App. 120.\nThe Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student\nbody diversity. To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear \"[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions,\" and provides examples of admittees\nwho have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of\nextensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields. Id., at 118-119. The Law School seriously considers each \"applicant's promise\nof making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic—e. g., an unusual intellectual achievement,\n\nemployment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.\" Id., at 83-84. All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential\ndiversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will\ncontribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.\nWhat is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race. The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants\nwith grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. See Brief for Respondent\nBollinger et al. 10; App. 121-122. This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and\n339 dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well. By this *339 flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in\ntheory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body. JUSTICE KENNEDY speculates that \"race is likely\noutcome determinative for many members of minority groups\" who do not fall within the upper range of LSAT scores and grades. Post, at 389 (dissenting\nopinion). But the same could be said of the Harvard plan discussed approvingly by Justice Powell in Bakke, and indeed of any plan that uses race as one of\nmany factors. See 438 U. S., at 316 (\"`When the Committee on Admissions reviews the large middle group of applicants who are \"admissible\" and deemed\ncapable of doing good work in their courses, the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor'\").\nPetitioner and the United States argue that the Law School's plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits\nof student body diversity that the Law School seeks. We disagree. Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.\nNor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to\nmembers of all racial groups. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (alternatives must serve the interest \"`about as well'\");\nRichmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 509-510 (plurality opinion) (city had a \"whole array of race-neutral\" alternatives because changing requirements\n\"would have [had] little detrimental effect on the city's interests\"). Narrow tailoring does, however, require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-\nneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks. See id., at 507 (set-aside plan not narrowly tailored where \"there does not appear to\n340 have been any consideration of the use of race-neutral means\"); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., supra, at 280, n. 6 (narrow tailoring *340 \"require[s]\nconsideration\" of \"lawful alternative and less restrictive means\").\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives. The District Court took the Law School to\ntask for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as \"using a lottery system\" or \"decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and\nLSAT scores.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a. But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or\nboth.\nThe Law School's current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways\nbroader than race. Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to\nmention every other kind of diversity. So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that\nwould require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission. The United States advocates\n\"percentage plans,\" recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California, to guarantee admission to all students above a\ncertain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-18. The United States does not, however, explain\nhow such plans could work for graduate and professional schools. Moreover, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university\nfrom conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued\nby the university. We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without\nforcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.\n341 *341 We acknowledge that \"there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself.\" Bakke, 438 U. S., at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.).\nNarrow tailoring, therefore, requires that a race-conscious admissions program not unduly harm members of any racial group. Even remedial race-based\ngovernmental action generally \"remains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing\nfor the benefit.\" Id., at 308. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program must not \"unduly burden individuals who are not members of the\nfavored racial and ethnic groups.\" Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 630 (1990) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).\nWe are satisfied that the Law School's admissions program does not. Because the Law School considers \"all pertinent elements of diversity,\" it can (and does)\nselect nonminority applicants who have greater potential to enhance student body diversity over underrepresented minority applicants. See Bakke, supra, at\n317 (opinion of Powell, J.). As Justice Powell recognized in Bakke, so long as a race-conscious admissions program uses race as a \"plus\" factor in the context\nof individualized consideration, a rejected applicant\n\"will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname.... His\nqualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment under the\nFourteenth Amendment.\" 438 U. S., at 318.\nWe agree that, in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School's race-conscious admissions\nprogram does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\nWe are mindful, however, that \"[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.\"\n342 Palmore v. Sidoti, *342 466 U. S. 429, 432 (1984). Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial\nclassifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.\nEnshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle. We see no reason to exempt race-\nconscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point. The Law School, too, concedes that all\n\"race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.\" Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 32.\n\nIn the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to\ndetermine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity. Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where\nracial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities\nin other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop. Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\n549, 581 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\"[T]he States may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best\nsolution is far from clear\").\nThe requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a termination point \"assure[s] all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal\ntreatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.\" Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488\nU. S., at 510 (plurality opinion); see also Nathanson & Bartnik, The Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants to Professional Schools,\n343 *343 58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977) (\"It would be a sad day indeed, were America to become a quota-ridden society, with each identifiable\nminority assigned proportional representation in every desirable walk of life. But that is not the rationale for programs of preferential treatment; the acid test of\ntheir justification will be their efficacy in eliminating the need for any racial or ethnic preferences at all\").\nWe take the Law School at its word that it would \"like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula\" and will terminate its race-conscious\nadmissions program as soon as practicable. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 34; Bakke, supra, at 317-318 (opinion of Powell, J.) (presuming good\nfaith of university officials in the absence of a showing to the contrary). It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an\ninterest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores\nhas indeed increased. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43. We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the\ninterest approved today.\nIV\nIn summary, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling\ninterest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. Consequently, petitioner's statutory claims based on Title VI and 42 U. S. C.\n§ 1981 also fail. See Bakke, supra, at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.)

Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389-391 (1982) (the prohibition against\n344 discrimination in § 1981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection Clause). The judgment *344 of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, accordingly, is\naffirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, concurring.\nThe Court's observation that race-conscious programs \"must have a logical end point,\" ante, at 342, accords with the international understanding of the office\nof affirmative action. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified by the United States in 1994, see State\nDept., Treaties in Force 422-423 (June 1996), endorses \"special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial\ngroups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\nAnnex to G. A. Res. 2106, 20 U. N. GAOR, 20th Sess., Res. Supp. (No. 14), p. 47, U. N. Doc. A/6014, Art. 2(2) (1965). But such measures, the Convention\ninstructs, \"shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they\nwere taken have been achieved.\" Ibid.; see also Art. 1(4) (similarly providing for temporally limited affirmative action); Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women, Annex to G. A. Res. 34/180, 34 U. N. GAOR, 34th Sess., Res. Supp. (No. 46), p. 194, U. N. Doc. A/34/46, Art. 4(1)\n(1979) (authorizing \"temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality\" that \"shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of\nopportunity and treatment have been achieved\").\nThe Court further observes that \"[i]t has been 25 years since Justice Powell [in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978)] first approved the use\n345 of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education.\" Ante, at 343. For at least part of that *345 time, however, the\nlaw could not fairly be described as \"settled,\" and in some regions of the Nation, overtly race-conscious admissions policies have been proscribed. See\nHopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996); cf. Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 (CA1 1998); Tuttle v. Arlington Cty. School Bd., 195 F. 3d 698 (CA4\n1999); Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001). Moreover, it was only 25 years before Bakke that this Court declared public\nschool segregation unconstitutional, a declaration that, after prolonged resistance, yielded an end to a law-enforced racial caste system, itself the legacy of\ncenturies of slavery. See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); cf. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958).\nIt is well documented that conscious and unconscious race bias, even rank discrimination based on race, remain alive in our land, impeding realization of our\nhighest values and ideals. See, e. g., Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, at 298-301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 272-\n274 (1995) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Krieger, Civil Rights Perestroika: Intergroup Relations after Affirmative Action, 86 Calif. L. Rev. 1251, 1276-1291, 1303\n(1998). As to public education, data for the years 2000-2001 show that 71.6% of African-American children and 76.3% of Hispanic children attended a school\nin which minorities made up a majority of the student body. See E. Frankenberg, C. Lee, & G. Orfield, A Multiracial Society with Segregated Schools: Are We\nLosing the Dream? p. 4 (Jan. 2003), http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/ reseg03/AreWeLosingtheDream.pdf (as visited June 16, 2003, and\navailable in Clerk of Court's case file). And schools in predominantly minority communities lag far behind others measured by the educational resources\navailable to them. See id., at 11; Brief for National Urban League et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12 (citing General Accounting Office, Per-Pupil Spending\nDifferences Between Selected Inner City and Suburban Schools Varied by Metropolitan Area 17 (2002)).\n346 *346 However strong the public's desire for improved education systems may be, see P. Hart & R. Teeter, A National Priority: Americans Speak on Teacher\n\nQuality 2, 11 (2002) (public opinion research conducted for Educational Testing Service); No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1806, 20\nU. S. C. § 7231 (2000 ed., Supp. I), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational\nopportunities. Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the country's finest\nundergraduate and graduate educational institutions. As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students\nmay be anticipated. From today's vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generation's span, progress toward nondiscrimination\nand genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.[*]\nJUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n347 I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE. As he demonstrates, the University of Michigan Law School's mystical *347 \"critical mass\" justification for its\ndiscrimination by race challenges even the most gullible mind. The admissions statistics show it to be a sham to cover a scheme of racially proportionate\nadmissions.\nI also join Parts I through VII of JUSTICE THOMAS's opinion.[*] I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly \"compelling state interest\"\nat issue here is not the incremental \"educational benefit\" that emanates from the fabled \"critical mass\" of minority students, but rather Michigan's interest in\nmaintaining a \"prestige\" law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities. If that is a compelling state\ninterest, everything is.\nI add the following: The \"educational benefit\" that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of\n\"`cross-racial understanding,'\" ante, at 330, and \"`better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,'\" ibid., all of which is\nnecessary not only for work, but also for good \"citizenship,\" ante, at 331. This is not, of course, an \"educational benefit\" on which students will be graded on\ntheir law school transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B+) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial\nunderstanding). For it is a lesson of life rather than law—essentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be \"taught\" in the usual\nsense) people three feet shorter and 20 years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy\nScout troops to public-school kindergartens. If properly considered an \"educational benefit\" at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law\n348 school or uniquely \"teachable\" in a formal educational setting. And therefore: If it is appropriate for the University *348 of Michigan Law School to use racial\ndiscrimination for the purpose of putting together a \"critical mass\" that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less\nappropriate—indeed, particularly appropriate —for the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so. There, also, those exposed to \"critical masses\" of\ncertain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants. And surely private employers cannot be criticized—indeed,\nshould be praised— if they also \"teach\" good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring. The\nnonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.\nUnlike a clear constitutional holding that racial preferences in state educational institutions are impermissible, or even a clear anticonstitutional holding that\nracial preferences in state educational institutions are OK, today's Grutter-Gratz split double header seems perversely designed to prolong the controversy and\nthe litigation. Some future lawsuits will presumably focus on whether the discriminatory scheme in question contains enough evaluation of the applicant \"as an\nindividual,\" ante, at 337, and sufficiently avoids \"separate admissions tracks,\" ante, at 334, to fall under Grutter rather than Gratz. Some will focus on whether a\nuniversity has gone beyond the bounds of a \"`good-faith effort'\" and has so zealously pursued its \"critical mass\" as to make it an unconstitutional de facto\nquota system, rather than merely \"`a permissible goal.'\" Ante, at 335 (quoting Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 495 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part)). Other lawsuits may focus on whether, in the particular setting at issue, any educational benefits flow from racial\ndiversity. (That issue was not contested in Grutter; and while the opinion accords \"a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions,\" ante, at 328,\n349 \"deference does not imply *349 abandonment or abdication of judicial review,\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003).) Still other suits may challenge\nthe bona fides of the institution's expressed commitment to the educational benefits of diversity that immunize the discriminatory scheme in Grutter. (Tempting\ntargets, one would suppose, will be those universities that talk the talk of multiculturalism and racial diversity in the courts but walk the walk of tribalism and\nracial segregation on their campuses—through minority-only student organizations, separate minority housing opportunities, separate minority student centers,\neven separate minority-only graduation ceremonies.) And still other suits may claim that the institution's racial preferences have gone below or above the\nmystical Grutter-approved \"critical mass.\" Finally, litigation can be expected on behalf of minority groups intentionally short changed in the institution's\ncomposition of its generic minority \"critical mass.\" I do not look forward to any of these cases. The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the\nbasis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.\nJUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins as to Parts I-VII, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nFrederick Douglass, speaking to a group of abolitionists almost 140 years ago, delivered a message lost on today's majority:\n\"[I]n regard to the colored people, there is always more that is benevolent, I perceive, than just, manifested towards us. What I ask for the negro\nis not benevolence, not pity, not sympathy, but simply justice. The American people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with\nus. . . . I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do\n350 nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of *350 their own strength, if they are worm-eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and\ndisposed to fall, let them fall! . . . And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his\nown legs! Let him alone! . . . [Y]our interference is doing him positive injury.\" What the Black Man Wants: An Address Delivered in Boston,\nMassachusetts, on 26 January 1865, reprinted in 4 The Frederick Douglass Papers 59, 68 (J. Blassingame & J. McKivigan eds. 1991)\n(emphasis in original).\nLike Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators. Because I wish to see all\nstudents succeed whatever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of\nMichigan Law School (Law School). The Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devotion to the status quo in admissions policies when such\n\ndevotion ripens into racial discrimination. Nor does the Constitution countenance the unprecedented deference the Court gives to the Law School, an\napproach inconsistent with the very concept of \"strict scrutiny.\"\nNo one would argue that a university could set up a lower general admissions standard and then impose heightened requirements only on black applicants.\nSimilarly, a university may not maintain a high admissions standard and grant exemptions to favored races. The Law School, of its own choosing, and for its\nown purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially disproportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible\nsolution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitist admissions policy.\nThe majority upholds the Law School's racial discrimination not by interpreting the people's Constitution, but by responding to a faddish slogan of the\n351 cognoscenti. Nevertheless, I concur in part in the Court's opinion. First, I agree with the Court insofar as its decision, which approves of only *351 one racial\nclassification, confirms that further use of race in admissions remains unlawful. Second, I agree with the Court's holding that racial discrimination in higher\neducation admissions will be illegal in 25 years. See ante, at 343 (stating that racial discrimination will no longer be narrowly tailored, or \"necessary to further\"\na compelling state interest, in 25 years). I respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court's opinion and the judgment, however, because I believe that the\nLaw School's current use of race violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution means the same thing today as it will in 300 months.\nI\nThe majority agrees that the Law School's racial discrimination should be subjected to strict scrutiny. Ante, at 326. Before applying that standard to this case, I\nwill briefly revisit the Court's treatment of racial classifications.\nThe strict scrutiny standard that the Court purports to apply in this case was first enunciated in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). There the\nCourt held that \"[p]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial antagonism never can.\" Id., at 216. This\nstandard of \"pressing public necessity\" has more frequently been termed \"compelling governmental interest,\"[1] see, e. g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n438 U. S. 265, 299 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). A majority of the Court has validated only two circumstances where \"pressing public necessity\" or a\n\"compelling state interest\" can possibly justify racial discrimination by state actors. First, the lesson of Korematsu is that national security constitutes a\n\"pressing public necessity,\" though the government's use of race to advance that objective must be narrowly tailored. Second, the Court has recognized as a\n352 compelling state interest a government's effort to remedy *352 past discrimination for which it is responsible. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 504\n(1989).\nThe contours of \"pressing public necessity\" can be further discerned from those interests the Court has rejected as bases for racial discrimination. For\nexample, Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), found unconstitutional a collective-bargaining agreement between a school board and a\nteachers' union that favored certain minority races. The school board defended the policy on the grounds that minority teachers provided \"role models\" for\nminority students and that a racially \"diverse\" faculty would improve the education of all students. See Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84-1340, pp. 27-\n28; 476 U. S., at 315 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"[A]n integrated faculty will be able to provide benefits to the student body that could not be provided by an\nall-white, or nearly all-white, faculty\"). Nevertheless, the Court found that the use of race violated the Equal Protection Clause, deeming both asserted state\ninterests insufficiently compelling. Id., at 275-276 (plurality opinion); id., at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (\"None of the interests asserted by the\n[school board] . . . justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy\").[2]\nAn even greater governmental interest involves the sensitive role of courts in child custody determinations. In Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429 (1984), the\nCourt held that even the best interests of a child did not constitute a compelling state interest that would allow a state court to award custody to the father\n353 because the mother was in a mixed-race marriage. Id., at 433 (finding the interest \"substantial\" but *353 holding the custody decision could not be based on\nthe race of the mother's new husband).\nFinally, the Court has rejected an interest in remedying general societal discrimination as a justification for race discrimination. See Wygant, supra, at 276\n(plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 496-498 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). \"Societal discrimination, without more,\nis too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy\" because a \"court could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and\ntimeless in their ability to affect the future.\" Wygant, supra, at 276 (plurality opinion). But see Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 298 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\nWhere the Court has accepted only national security, and rejected even the best interests of a child, as a justification for racial discrimination, I conclude that\nonly those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent violence, will constitute a \"pressing public necessity.\" Cf. Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (per curiam) (Black, J., concurring) (indicating that protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored\nracial discrimination); Croson, supra, at 521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"At least where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency\nrising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb . . . can justify [racial discrimination]\").\nThe Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but\nalso because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.\n\"Purchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, the equal protection principle reflects our Nation's understanding that such classifications ultimately\n354 have a destructive impact on the individual and our society.\" *354 Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment).\nII\nUnlike the majority, I seek to define with precision the interest being asserted by the Law School before determining whether that interest is so compelling as to\n\njustify racial discrimination. The Law School maintains that it wishes to obtain \"educational benefits that flow from student body diversity,\" Brief for Respondent\nBollinger et al. 14. This statement must be evaluated carefully, because it implies that both \"diversity\" and \"educational benefits\" are components of the Law\nSchool's compelling state interest. Additionally, the Law School's refusal to entertain certain changes in its admissions process and status indicates that the\ncompelling state interest it seeks to validate is actually broader than might appear at first glance.\nUndoubtedly there are other ways to \"better\" the education of law students aside from ensuring that the student body contains a \"critical mass\" of\n355 underrepresented minority students. Attaining \"diversity,\" whatever it means,[3] is the *355 mechanism by which the Law School obtains educational benefits,\nnot an end of itself. The Law School, however, apparently believes that only a racially mixed student body can lead to the educational benefits it seeks. How,\nthen, is the Law School's interest in these allegedly unique educational \"benefits\" not simply the forbidden interest in \"racial balancing,\" ante, at 330, that the\nmajority expressly rejects?\nA distinction between these two ideas (unique educational benefits based on racial aesthetics and race for its own sake) is purely sophistic—so much so that\nthe majority uses them interchangeably. Compare ante, at 328 (\"[T]he Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body\"), with ante, at\n333 (referring to the \"compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body\" (emphasis added)). The Law School's argument, as\nfacile as it is, can only be understood in one way: Classroom aesthetics yields educational benefits, racially discriminatory admissions policies are required to\nachieve the right racial mix, and therefore the policies are required to achieve the educational benefits. It is the educational benefits that are the end, or\nallegedly compelling state interest, not \"diversity.\" But see ante, at 332 (citing the need for \"openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide\n[legal] training\" without reference to any consequential educational benefits).\nOne must also consider the Law School's refusal to entertain changes to its current admissions system that might produce the same educational benefits. The\nLaw School adamantly disclaims any race-neutral alternative that would reduce \"academic selectivity,\" which would in turn \"require the Law School to become\na very different institution, and to sacrifice a core part of its educational mission.\" Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 33-36. In other words, the Law School\n356 seeks to improve marginally the education it offers *356 without sacrificing too much of its exclusivity and elite status.[4]\nThe proffered interest that the majority vindicates today, then, is not simply \"diversity.\" Instead the Court upholds the use of racial discrimination as a tool to\nadvance the Law School's interest in offering a marginally superior education while maintaining an elite institution. Unless each constituent part of this state\ninterest is of pressing public necessity, the Law School's use of race is unconstitutional. I find each of them to fall far short of this standard.\nIII\nA\nA close reading of the Court's opinion reveals that all of its legal work is done through one conclusory statement: The Law School has a \"compelling interest in\nsecuring the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\" Ante, at 333. No serious effort is made to explain how these benefits fit with the state interests the\nCourt has recognized (or rejected) as compelling, see Part I, supra, or to place any theoretical constraints on an enterprising court's desire to discover still\nmore justifications for racial discrimination. In the absence of any explanation, one might expect the Court to fall back on the judicial policy of stare decisis. But\nthe Court eschews even this weak defense of its holding, shunning an analysis of the extent to which Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\n357 Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), *357 is binding, ante, at 325, in favor of an unfounded wholesale adoption of it.\nJustice Powell's opinion in Bakke and the Court's decision today rest on the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualized\nso that a goal, such as classroom aesthetics, can be compelling in one context but not in another. This \"we know it when we see it\" approach to evaluating\nstate interests is not capable of judicial application. Today, the Court insists on radically expanding the range of permissible uses of race to something as trivial\n(by comparison) as the assembling of a law school class. I can only presume that the majority's failure to justify its decision by reference to any principle arises\nfrom the absence of any such principle. See Part VI, infra.\nB\nUnder the proper standard, there is no pressing public necessity in maintaining a public law school at all and, it follows, certainly not an elite law school.\nLikewise, marginal improvements in legal education do not qualify as a compelling state interest.\n1\nWhile legal education at a public university may be good policy or otherwise laudable, it is obviously not a pressing public necessity when the correct legal\nstandard is applied. Additionally, circumstantial evidence as to whether a state activity is of pressing public necessity can be obtained by asking whether all\nStates feel compelled to engage in that activity. Evidence that States, in general, engage in a certain activity by no means demonstrates that the activity\nconstitutes a pressing public necessity, given the expansive role of government in today's society. The fact that some fraction of the States reject a particular\nenterprise, however, creates a presumption that the enterprise itself is not a compelling state interest. In this sense, the absence of a public, American Bar\n358 Association (ABA) accredited, law school in *358 Alaska, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, see ABA-LSAC Official Guide to\nABA-Approved Law Schools (W. Margolis, B. Gordon, J. Puskarz, & D. Rosenlieb eds. 2004) (hereinafter ABA-LSAC Guide), provides further evidence that\nMichigan's maintenance of the Law School does not constitute a compelling state interest.\n\n2\nAs the foregoing makes clear, Michigan has no compelling interest in having a law school at all, much less an elite one. Still, even assuming that a State may,\nunder appropriate circumstances, demonstrate a cognizable interest in having an elite law school, Michigan has failed to do so here.\nThis Court has limited the scope of equal protection review to interests and activities that occur within that State's jurisdiction. The Court held in Missouri ex rel.\nGaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938), that Missouri could not satisfy the demands of \"separate but equal\" by paying for legal training of blacks at\nneighboring state law schools, while maintaining a segregated law school within the State. The equal protection\n\"obligation is imposed by the Constitution upon the States severally as governmental entities,—each responsible for its own laws establishing\nthe rights and duties of persons within its borders. It is an obligation the burden of which cannot be cast by one State upon another, and no\nState can be excused from performance by what another State may do or fail to do. That separate responsibility of each State within its own\nsphere is of the essence of statehood maintained under our dual system.\" Id., at 350 (emphasis added).\nThe Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by the Court in Gaines, does not permit States to justify racial discrimination on the basis of what the rest of the\n359 Nation \"may do or fail to do.\" The only interests that can satisfy the Equal *359 Protection Clause's demands are those found within a State's jurisdiction.\nThe only cognizable state interests vindicated by operating a public law school are, therefore, the education of that State's citizens and the training of that\nState's lawyers. James Campbell's address at the opening of the Law Department at the University of Michigan on October 3, 1859, makes this clear:\n\"It not only concerns the State that every one should have all reasonable facilities for preparing himself for any honest position in life to which\nhe may aspire, but it also concerns the community that the Law should be taught and understood. . . . There is not an office in the State in\nwhich serious legal inquiries may not frequently arise. . . . In all these matters, public and private rights are constantly involved and discussed,\nand ignorance of the Law has frequently led to results deplorable and alarming. . . . [I]n the history of this State, in more than one instance, that\nignorance has led to unlawful violence, and the shedding of innocent blood.\" E. Brown, Legal Education at Michigan 1859-1959, pp. 404-406\n(1959) (emphasis added).\nThe Law School today, however, does precious little training of those attorneys who will serve the citizens of Michigan. In 2002, graduates of the Law School\nmade up less than 6% of applicants to the Michigan bar, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, available at http://www.michiganlawyersweekly.com/\nbarpassers0202.cfm,barpassers0702 .cfm (all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court's case file), even though the Law\nSchool's graduates constitute nearly 30% of all law students graduating in Michigan. Ibid. Less than 16% of the Law School's graduating class elects to stay in\n360 Michigan after law school. ABA-LSAC Guide 427. Thus, while a mere 27% of the Law School's 2002 entering class is from Michigan, see University of *360\nMichigan Law School Website, available at http://www.law. umich.edu/prospectivestudents/Admissions/index.htm, only half of these, it appears, will stay in\nMichigan.\nIn sum, the Law School trains few Michigan residents and overwhelmingly serves students, who, as lawyers, leave the State of Michigan. By contrast,\nMichigan's other public law school, Wayne State University Law School, sends 88% of its graduates on to serve the people of Michigan. ABA-LSAC Guide\n775. It does not take a social scientist to conclude that it is precisely the Law School's status as an elite institution that causes it to be a waystation for the rest\nof the country's lawyers, rather than a training ground for those who will remain in Michigan. The Law School's decision to be an elite institution does little to\nadvance the welfare of the people of Michigan or any cognizable interest of the State of Michigan.\nAgain, the fact that few States choose to maintain elite law schools raises a strong inference that there is nothing compelling about elite status. Arguably, only\nthe public law schools of the University of Texas, the University of California, Berkeley (Boalt Hall), and the University of Virginia maintain the same reputation\nfor excellence as the Law School.[5] Two of these States, Texas and California, are so large that they could reasonably be expected to provide elite legal\ntraining at a separate law school to students who will, in fact, stay in the State and provide legal services to its citizens. And these two schools far outshine the\nLaw School in producing in-state lawyers. The University of Texas, for example, sends over three-fourths of its graduates on to work in the State of Texas,\nvindicating the State's interest (compelling or not) in training Texas' lawyers. Id., at 691.\n361  3\n*361\nFinally, even if the Law School's racial tinkering produces tangible educational benefits, a marginal improvement in legal education cannot justify racial\ndiscrimination where the Law School has no compelling interest either in its existence or in its current educational and admissions policies.\nIV\nThe interest in remaining elite and exclusive that the majority thinks so obviously critical requires the use of admissions \"standards\" that, in turn, create the Law\nSchool's \"need\" to discriminate on the basis of race. The Court validates these admissions standards by concluding that alternatives that would require \"a\ndramatic sacrifice of . . . the academic quality of all admitted students,\" ante, at 340, need not be considered before racial discrimination can be employed.[6] In\nthe majority's view, such methods are not required by the \"narrow tailoring\" prong of strict scrutiny because that inquiry demands, in this context, that any race-\nneutral alternative work \"`about as well.'\" Ante, at 339 (quoting Wygant, 476 U. S., at 280, n. 6). The majority errs, however, because race-neutral alternatives\nmust only be \"workable,\" ante, at 339, and do \"about as well\" in vindicating the compelling state interest. The Court never explicitly holds that the Law School's\ndesire to retain the status quo in \"academic selectivity\" is itself a compelling state interest, and, as I have demonstrated, it is not. See Part III-B, supra.\nTherefore, the Law School should be forced to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admissions system—it cannot have it both ways.\n\n362 With the adoption of different admissions methods, such as accepting all students who meet minimum qualifications, *362 see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 13-14, the Law School could achieve its vision of the racially aesthetic student body without the use of racial discrimination. The Law School\nconcedes this, but the Court holds, implicitly and under the guise of narrow tailoring, that the Law School has a compelling state interest in doing what it wants\nto do. I cannot agree. First, under strict scrutiny, the Law School's assessment of the benefits of racial discrimination and devotion to the admissions status quo\nare not entitled to any sort of deference, grounded in the First Amendment or anywhere else. Second, even if its \"academic selectivity\" must be maintained at\nall costs along with racial discrimination, the Court ignores the fact that other top law schools have succeeded in meeting their aesthetic demands without\nracial discrimination.\nA\nThe Court bases its unprecedented deference to the Law School—a deference antithetical to strict scrutiny—on an idea of \"educational autonomy\" grounded\nin the First Amendment. Ante, at 329. In my view, there is no basis for a right of public universities to do what would otherwise violate the Equal Protection\nClause.\nThe constitutionalization of \"academic freedom\" began with the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234 (1957).\nSweezy, a Marxist economist, was investigated by the Attorney General of New Hampshire on suspicion of being a subversive. The prosecution sought, inter\nalia, the contents of a lecture Sweezy had given at the University of New Hampshire. The Court held that the investigation violated due process. Id., at 254.\nJustice Frankfurter went further, however, reasoning that the First Amendment created a right of academic freedom that prohibited the investigation. Id., at\n256-267 (opinion concurring in result). Much of the rhetoric in Justice Frankfurter's opinion was devoted to the personal right of Sweezy to free speech. See, e.\n363 g., id., at 265 (\"For a citizen to be *363 made to forego even a part of so basic a liberty as his political autonomy, the subordinating interest of the State must\nbe compelling\"). Still, claiming that the United States Reports \"need not be burdened with proof,\" Justice Frankfurter also asserted that a \"free society\"\ndepends on \"free universities\" and \"[t]his means the exclusion of governmental intervention in the intellectual life of a university.\" Id., at 262. According to\nJustice Frankfurter: \"It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an\natmosphere in which there prevail `the four essential freedoms' of a university—to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be\ntaught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.\" Id., at 263 (citation omitted).\nIn my view, \"[i]t is the business\" of this Court to explain itself when it cites provisions of the Constitution to invent new doctrines—including the idea that the\nFirst Amendment authorizes a public university to do what would otherwise violate the Equal Protection Clause. The majority fails in its summary effort to prove\nthis point. The only source for the Court's conclusion that public universities are entitled to deference even within the confines of strict scrutiny is Justice\nPowell's opinion in Bakke. Justice Powell, for his part, relied only on Justice Frankfurter's opinion in Sweezy and the Court's decision in Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967), to support his view that the First Amendment somehow protected a public university's use of race in\nadmissions. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 312. Keyishian provides no answer to the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions are relaxed when\napplied to public universities. In that case, the Court held that state statutes and regulations designed to prevent the \"appointment or retention of `subversive'\npersons in state employment,\" 385 U. S., at 592, violated the First Amendment for vagueness. The statutes covered all public employees and were not\n364 invalidated only as applied to university *364 faculty members, although the Court appeared sympathetic to the notion of academic freedom, calling it a\n\"special concern of the First Amendment.\" Id., at 603. Again, however, the Court did not relax any independent constitutional restrictions on public universities.\nI doubt that when Justice Frankfurter spoke of governmental intrusions into the independence of universities, he was thinking of the Constitution's ban on racial\ndiscrimination. The majority's broad deference to both the Law School's judgment that racial aesthetics leads to educational benefits and its stubborn refusal to\nalter the status quo in admissions methods finds no basis in the Constitution or decisions of this Court.\nB\n1\nThe Court's deference to the Law School's conclusion that its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits will, if adhered to, have serious collateral\nconsequences. The Court relies heavily on social science evidence to justify its deference. See ante, at 330-332; but see also Rothman, Lipset, & Nevitte,\nRacial Diversity Reconsidered, 151 Public Interest 25 (2003) (finding that the racial mix of a student body produced by racial discrimination of the type\npracticed by the Law School in fact hinders students' perception of academic quality). The Court never acknowledges, however, the growing evidence that\nracial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students. See, e. g., Flowers & Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College Racial\nComposition on African American Students After 3 Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669, 674 (1999) (concluding that black students\nexperience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and that, even among blacks, \"a substantial diversity moderates the cognitive\n365 effects of attending an HBC\"); Allen, The Color of Success: African-American College Student *365 Outcomes at Predominantly White and Historically Black\nPublic Colleges and Universities, 62 Harv. Educ. Rev. 26, 35 (1992) (finding that black students attending HBCs report higher academic achievement than\nthose attending predominantly white colleges).\nAt oral argument in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 244, counsel for respondents stated that \"most every single one of [the HBCs] do have diverse student bodies.\"\nTr. of Oral Arg. in No. 02-516, p. 52. What precisely counsel meant by \"diverse\" is indeterminate, but it is reported that in 2000 at Morehouse College, one of\nthe most distinguished HBCs in the Nation, only 0.1% of the student body was white, and only 0.2% was Hispanic. College Admissions Data Handbook 2002-\n2003, p. 613 (43d ed. 2002) (hereinafter College Admissions Data Handbook). And at Mississippi Valley State University, a public HBC, only 1.1% of the\nfreshman class in 2001 was white. Id., at 603. If there is a \"critical mass\" of whites at these institutions, then \"critical mass\" is indeed a very small proportion.\n\nThe majority grants deference to the Law School's \"assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits,\" ante, at 328. It follows, therefore, that an\nHBC's assessment that racial homogeneity will yield educational benefits would similarly be given deference.[7] An HBC's rejection of white applicants in order\nto maintain racial homogeneity seems permissible, therefore, under the majority's view of the Equal Protection Clause. But see United States v. Fordice, 505\nU. S. 717, 748 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\"Obviously, a State cannot maintain . . . traditions by closing particular institutions, historically white or\n366 historically black, to particular racial groups\"). Contained within today's majority opinion is the seed of a new constitutional *366 justification for a concept I\nthought long and rightly rejected—racial segregation.\n2\nMoreover one would think, in light of the Court's decision in United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996), that before being given license to use racial\ndiscrimination, the Law School would be required to radically reshape its admissions process, even to the point of sacrificing some elements of its character. In\nVirginia, a majority of the Court, without a word about academic freedom, accepted the all-male Virginia Military Institute's (VMI) representation that some\nchanges in its \"adversative\" method of education would be required with the admission of women, id., at 540, but did not defer to VMI's judgment that these\nchanges would be too great. Instead, the Court concluded that they were \"manageable.\" Id., at 551, n. 19. That case involved sex discrimination, which is\nsubjected to intermediate, not strict, scrutiny. Id., at 533; Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976). So in Virginia, where the standard of review dictated that\ngreater flexibility be granted to VMI's educational policies than the Law School deserves here, this Court gave no deference. Apparently where the status quo\nbeing defended is that of the elite establishment—here the Law School—rather than a less fashionable Southern military institution, the Court will defer without\nserious inquiry and without regard to the applicable legal standard.\nC\nVirginia is also notable for the fact that the Court relied on the \"experience\" of formerly single-sex institutions, such as the service academies, to conclude that\nadmission of women to VMI would be \"manageable.\" 518 U. S., at 544-545. Today, however, the majority ignores the \"experience\" of those institutions that\nhave been forced to abandon explicit racial discrimination in admissions.\n367 *367 The sky has not fallen at Boalt Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, for example. Prior to Proposition 209's adoption of Cal. Const., Art. 1, § 31(a),\nwhich bars the State from \"grant[ing] preferential treatment . . . on the basis of race . . . in the operation of . . . public education,\"[8] Boalt Hall enrolled 20 blacks\nand 28 Hispanics in its first-year class for 1996. In 2002, without deploying express racial discrimination in admissions, Boalt's entering class enrolled 14\nblacks and 36 Hispanics.[9] University of California Law and Medical School Enrollments, available at http://www.ucop.edu/ acadadv/datamgmt/lawmed/law-\nenrolls-eth2.html. Total underrepresented minority student enrollment at Boalt Hall now exceeds 1996 levels. Apparently the Law School cannot be counted on\nto be as resourceful. The Court is willfully blind to the very real experience in California and elsewhere, which raises the inference that institutions with\n\"reputation[s] for excellence,\" ante, at 339, rivaling the Law School's have satisfied their sense of mission without resorting to prohibited racial discrimination.\nV\nPutting aside the absence of any legal support for the majority's reflexive deference, there is much to be said for the view that the use of tests and other\nmeasures to \"predict\" academic performance is a poor substitute for a system that gives every applicant a chance to prove he can succeed in the study of law.\n368 The rallying cry that in the absence of racial discrimination in admissions there would be a true *368 meritocracy ignores the fact that the entire process is\npoisoned by numerous exceptions to \"merit.\" For example, in the national debate on racial discrimination in higher education admissions, much has been\nmade of the fact that elite institutions utilize a so-called \"legacy\" preference to give the children of alumni an advantage in admissions. This, and other,\nexceptions to a \"true\" meritocracy give the lie to protestations that merit admissions are in fact the order of the day at the Nation's universities. The Equal\nProtection Clause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissions procedures. What the Equal\nProtection Clause does prohibit are classifications made on the basis of race. So while legacy preferences can stand under the Constitution, racial\ndiscrimination cannot.[10] I will not twist the Constitution to invalidate legacy preferences or otherwise impose my vision of higher education admissions on the\nNation. The majority should similarly stay its impulse to validate faddish racial discrimination the Constitution clearly forbids.\nIn any event, there is nothing ancient, honorable, or constitutionally protected about \"selective\" admissions. The University of Michigan should be well aware\nthat alternative methods have historically been used for the admission of students, for it brought to this country the German certificate system in the late-19th\ncentury. See H. Wechsler, The Qualified Student 16-39 (1977) (hereinafter Qualified Student). Under this system, a secondary school was certified by a\nuniversity so that any graduate who completed the course offered by the school was offered admission to the university. The certification regime\n369 supplemented, and later virtually replaced (at least in the Midwest), the prior regime of rigorous *369 subject-matter entrance examinations. Id., at 57-58. The\nfacially race-neutral \"percent plans\" now used in Texas, California, and Florida, see ante, at 340, are in many ways the descendents of the certificate system.\nCertification was replaced by selective admissions in the beginning of the 20th century, as universities sought to exercise more control over the composition of\ntheir student bodies. Since its inception, selective admissions has been the vehicle for racial, ethnic, and religious tinkering and experimentation by university\nadministrators. The initial driving force for the relocation of the selective function from the high school to the universities was the same desire to select racial\nwinners and losers that the Law School exhibits today. Columbia, Harvard, and others infamously determined that they had \"too many\" Jews, just as today the\nLaw School argues it would have \"too many\" whites if it could not discriminate in its admissions process. See Qualified Student 155-168 (Columbia); H. Broun\n& G. Britt, Christians Only: A Study in Prejudice 53-54 (1931) (Harvard).\nColumbia employed intelligence tests precisely because Jewish applicants, who were predominantly immigrants, scored worse on such tests. Thus, Columbia\n\ncould claim (falsely) that \"`[w]e have not eliminated boys because they were Jews and do not propose to do so. We have honestly attempted to eliminate the\nlowest grade of applicant [through the use of intelligence testing] and it turns out that a good many of the low grade men are New York City Jews.'\" Letter from\nHerbert E. Hawkes, dean of Columbia College, to E. B. Wilson, June 16, 1922 (reprinted in Qualified Student 160-161). In other words, the tests were adopted\nwith full knowledge of their disparate impact. Cf. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 335 (1974) (per curiam) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\nSimilarly no modern law school can claim ignorance of the poor performance of blacks, relatively speaking, on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).\n370 Nevertheless, law schools *370 continue to use the test and then attempt to \"correct\" for black underperformance by using racial discrimination in admissions\nso as to obtain their aesthetic student body. The Law School's continued adherence to measures it knows produce racially skewed results is not entitled to\ndeference by this Court. See Part IV, supra. The Law School itself admits that the test is imperfect, as it must, given that it regularly admits students who score\nat or below 150 (the national median) on the test. See App. 156-203 (showing that, between 1995 and 2000, the Law School admitted 37 students—27 of\nwhom were black; 31 of whom were \"underrepresented minorities\"—with LSAT scores of 150 or lower). And the Law School's amici cannot seem to agree on\nthe fundamental question whether the test itself is useful. Compare Brief for Law School Admission Council as Amicus Curiae 12 (\"LSAT scores . . . are an\neffective predictor of students' performance in law school\") with Brief for Harvard Black Law Students Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27 (\"Whether [the\nLSAT] measure[s] objective merit . . . is certainly questionable\").\nHaving decided to use the LSAT, the Law School must accept the constitutional burdens that come with this decision. The Law School may freely continue to\nemploy the LSAT and other allegedly merit-based standards in whatever fashion it likes. What the Equal Protection Clause forbids, but the Court today allows,\nis the use of these standards hand-in-hand with racial discrimination. An infinite variety of admissions methods are available to the Law School. Considering all\nof the radical thinking that has historically occurred at this country's universities, the Law School's intractable approach toward admissions is striking.\nThe Court will not even deign to make the Law School try other methods, however, preferring instead to grant a 25-year license to violate the Constitution. And\n371 the same Court that had the courage to order the desegregation of all public schools in the South now fears, on the basis of platitudes *371 rather than\nprinciple, to force the Law School to abandon a decidedly imperfect admissions regime that provides the basis for racial discrimination.\nVI\nThe absence of any articulated legal principle supporting the majority's principal holding suggests another rationale. I believe what lies beneath the Court's\ndecision today are the benighted notions that one can tell when racial discrimination benefits (rather than hurts) minority groups, see Adarand, 515 U. S., at\n239 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and that racial discrimination is necessary to remedy general societal ills. This Court's\nprecedents supposedly settled both issues, but clearly the majority still cannot commit to the principle that racial classifications are per se harmful and that\nalmost no amount of benefit in the eye of the beholder can justify such classifications.\nPutting aside what I take to be the Court's implicit rejection of Adarand's holding that beneficial and burdensome racial classifications are equally invalid, I must\ncontest the notion that the Law School's discrimination benefits those admitted as a result of it. The Court spends considerable time discussing the impressive\ndisplay of amicus support for the Law School in this case from all corners of society. Ante, at 330-331. But nowhere in any of the filings in this Court is any\nevidence that the purported \"beneficiaries\" of this racial discrimination prove themselves by performing at (or even near) the same level as those students who\nreceive no preferences. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on the Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605-1608 (1999) (discussing the failure\nof defenders of racial discrimination in admissions to consider the fact that its \"beneficiaries\" are underperforming in the classroom).\nThe silence in this case is deafening to those of us who view higher education's purpose as imparting knowledge and skills to students, rather than a\n372 communal, rubber-stamp, *372 credentialing process. The Law School is not looking for those students who, despite a lower LSAT score or undergraduate\ngrade point average, will succeed in the study of law. The Law School seeks only a facade—it is sufficient that the class looks right, even if it does not perform\nright.\nThe Law School tantalizes unprepared students with the promise of a University of Michigan degree and all of the opportunities that it offers. These\novermatched students take the bait, only to find that they cannot succeed in the cauldron of competition. And this mismatch crisis is not restricted to elite\ninstitutions. See T. Sowell, Race and Culture 176-177 (1994) (\"Even if most minority students are able to meet the normal standards at the `average' range of\ncolleges and universities, the systematic mismatching of minority students begun at the top can mean that such students are generally overmatched\nthroughout all levels of higher education\"). Indeed, to cover the tracks of the aestheticists, this cruel farce of racial discrimination must continue— in selection\nfor the Michigan Law Review, see University of Michigan Law School Student Handbook 2002-2003, pp. 39-40 (noting the presence of a \"diversity plan\" for\nadmission to the review), and in hiring at law firms and for judicial clerkships—until the \"beneficiaries\" are no longer tolerated. While these students may\ngraduate with law degrees, there is no evidence that they have received a qualitatively better legal education (or become better lawyers) than if they had gone\nto a less \"elite\" law school for which they were better prepared. And the aestheticists will never address the real problems facing \"underrepresented minorities,\"\n[11] instead continuing their social experiments on other people's children.\n373 *373 Beyond the harm the Law School's racial discrimination visits upon its test subjects, no social science has disproved the notion that this discrimination\n\"engender[s] attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government's use of\nrace.\" Adarand, 515 U. S., at 241 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \"These programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority\nand may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are `entitled' to preferences.\" Ibid.\nIt is uncontested that each year, the Law School admits a handful of blacks who would be admitted in the absence of racial discrimination. See Brief for\nRespondent Bollinger et al. 6. Who can differentiate between those who belong and those who do not? The majority of blacks are admitted to the Law School\nbecause of discrimination, and because of this policy all are tarred as undeserving. This problem of stigma does not depend on determinacy as to whether\nthose stigmatized are actually the \"beneficiaries\" of racial discrimination. When blacks take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or\n\nacademia, it is an open question today whether their skin color played a part in their advancement. The question itself is the stigma—because either racial\ndiscrimination did play a role, in which case the person may be deemed \"otherwise unqualified,\" or it did not, in which case asking the question itself unfairly\nmarks those blacks who would succeed without discrimination. Is this what the Court means by \"visibly open\"? Ante, at 332.\nFinally, the Court's disturbing reference to the importance of the country's law schools as training grounds meant to cultivate \"a set of leaders with legitimacy in\n374 the eyes of the citizenry,\" ibid., through the use of racial discrimination deserves discussion. As noted earlier, the Court has soundly *374 rejected the\nremedying of societal discrimination as a justification for governmental use of race. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 497\n(plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). For those who believe that every racial disproportionality in our society is caused by\nsome kind of racial discrimination, there can be no distinction between remedying societal discrimination and erasing racial disproportionalities in the country's\nleadership caste. And if the lack of proportional racial representation among our leaders is not caused by societal discrimination, then \"fixing\" it is even less of\na pressing public necessity.\nThe Court's civics lesson presents yet another example of judicial selection of a theory of political representation based on skin color—an endeavor I have\npreviously rejected. See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 899 (1994) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). The majority appears to believe that broader utopian\ngoals justify the Law School's use of race, but \"[t]he Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy\nour theory as to how society ought to be organized.\" DeFunis, 416 U. S., at 342 (Douglas, J., dissenting).\nVII\nAs the foregoing makes clear, I believe the Court's opinion to be, in most respects, erroneous. I do, however, find two points on which I agree.\nA\nFirst, I note that the issue of unconstitutional racial discrimination among the groups the Law School prefers is not presented in this case, because petitioner\nhas never argued that the Law School engages in such a practice, and the Law School maintains that it does not. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 32,\n375 n. 50, and 6-7, n. 7. I join the Court's opinion insofar as it confirms that this type of racial discrimination remains unlawful. Ante, at 326-327. Under today's *375\ndecision, it is still the case that racial discrimination that does not help a university to enroll an unspecified number, or \"critical mass,\" of underrepresented\nminority students is unconstitutional. Thus, the Law School may not discriminate in admissions between similarly situated blacks and Hispanics, or between\nwhites and Asians. This is so because preferring black to Hispanic applicants, for instance, does nothing to further the interest recognized by the majority\ntoday.[12] Indeed, the majority describes such racial balancing as \"patently unconstitutional.\" Ante, at 330. Like the Court, ante, at 336, I express no opinion as\nto whether the Law School's current admissions program runs afoul of this prohibition.\nB\nThe Court also holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years before it is deemed no longer narrowly tailored to the Law\nSchool's fabricated compelling state interest. Ante, at 343. While I agree that in 25 years the practices of the Law School will be illegal, they are, for the\nreasons I have given, illegal now. The majority does not and cannot rest its time limitation on any evidence that the gap in credentials between black and white\n376 *376 students is shrinking or will be gone in that timeframe.[13] In recent years there has been virtually no change, for example, in the proportion of law school\napplicants with LSAT scores of 165 and higher who are black.[14] In 1993 blacks constituted 1.1% of law school applicants in that score range, though they\nrepresented 11.1% of all applicants. Law School Admission Council, National Statistical Report (1994) (hereinafter LSAC Statistical Report). In 2000 the\ncomparable numbers were 1.0% and 11.3%. LSAC Statistical Report (2001). No one can seriously contend, and the Court does not, that the racial gap in\nacademic credentials will disappear in 25 years. Nor is the Court's holding that racial discrimination will be unconstitutional in 25 years made contingent on the\ngap closing in that time.[15]\n377 *377 Indeed, the very existence of racial discrimination of the type practiced by the Law School may impede the narrowing of the LSAT testing gap. An\napplicant's LSAT score can improve dramatically with preparation, but such preparation is a cost, and there must be sufficient benefits attached to an improved\nscore to justify additional study. Whites scoring between 163 and 167 on the LSAT are routinely rejected by the Law School, and thus whites aspiring to\nadmission at the Law School have every incentive to improve their score to levels above that range. See App. 199 (showing that in 2000, 209 out of 422 white\napplicants were rejected in this scoring range). Blacks, on the other hand, are nearly guaranteed admission if they score above 155. Id., at 198 (showing that\n63 out of 77 black applicants are accepted with LSAT scores above 155). As admission prospects approach certainty, there is no incentive for the black\napplicant to continue to prepare for the LSAT once he is reasonably assured of achieving the requisite score. It is far from certain that the LSAT test-taker's\nbehavior is responsive to the Law School's admissions policies.[16] Nevertheless, the possibility remains that this racial discrimination will help fulfill the bigot's\nprophecy about black underperformance—just as it confirms the conspiracy theorist's belief that \"institutional racism\" is at fault for every racial disparity in our\nsociety.\nI therefore can understand the imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School's educational judgments\n378 and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that point these policies will clearly have failed to \"`eliminat[e] *378 the [perceived] need for\nany racial or ethnic'\" discrimination because the academic credentials gap will still be there. Ante, at 343 (quoting Nathanson & Bartnik, The Constitutionality of\nPreferential Treatment for Minority Applicants to Professional Schools, 58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977)). The Court defines this time limit in\nterms of narrow tailoring, see ante, at 343, but I believe this arises from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicated today. Cf. Part II,\nsupra. With these observations, I join the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of the Court.\n\n* * *\nFor the immediate future, however, the majority has placed its imprimatur on a practice that can only weaken the principle of equality embodied in the\nDeclaration of Independence and the Equal Protection Clause. \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). It has been nearly 140 years since Frederick Douglass asked the intellectual ancestors\nof the Law School to \"[d]o nothing with us!\" and the Nation adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. Now we must wait another 25 years to see this principle of\nequality vindicated. I therefore respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court's opinion and the judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\nI agree with the Court that, \"in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible,\" the government must ensure that its means are\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Ante, at 333; see also Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 498 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring) (\"[E]ven\nif the government proffers a compelling interest to support reliance upon a suspect classification, the means selected must be narrowly drawn to fulfill the\n379 governmental *379 purpose\"). I do not believe, however, that the University of Michigan Law School's (Law School) means are narrowly tailored to the interest\nit asserts. The Law School claims it must take the steps it does to achieve a \"`critical mass'\" of underrepresented minority students. Brief for Respondent\nBollinger et al. 13. But its actual program bears no relation to this asserted goal. Stripped of its \"critical mass\" veil, the Law School's program is revealed as a\nnaked effort to achieve racial balancing.\nAs we have explained many times, \"`\"[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination.\"'\" Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 223 (1995) (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 273 (1986) (plurality opinion of Powell, J.)). Our\ncases establish that, in order to withstand this demanding inquiry, respondents must demonstrate that their methods of using race \"`fit'\" a compelling state\ninterest \"with greater precision than any alternative means.\" Id., at 280, n. 6; Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 299 (1978) (opinion of Powell,\nJ.) (\"When [political judgments] touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to\nbear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest\").\nBefore the Court's decision today, we consistently applied the same strict scrutiny analysis regardless of the government's purported reason for using race and\nregardless of the setting in which race was being used. We rejected calls to use more lenient review in the face of claims that race was being used in \"good\nfaith\" because \"`[m]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification\nsystem.'\" Adarand, supra, at 226; Fullilove, supra, at 537 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the\n380 most exact connection between justification and classification\"). We likewise rejected *380 calls to apply more lenient review based on the particular setting in\nwhich race is being used. Indeed, even in the specific context of higher education, we emphasized that \"constitutional limitations protecting individual rights\nmay not be disregarded.\" Bakke, supra, at 314.\nAlthough the Court recites the language of our strict scrutiny analysis, its application of that review is unprecedented in its deference.\nRespondents' asserted justification for the Law School's use of race in the admissions process is \"obtaining `the educational benefits that flow from a diverse\nstudent body.'\" Ante, at 328 (quoting Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. i). They contend that a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minorities is necessary to\nfurther that interest. Ante, at 330. Respondents and school administrators explain generally that \"critical mass\" means a sufficient number of underrepresented\nminority students to achieve several objectives: To ensure that these minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race; to provide\nadequate opportunities for the type of interaction upon which the educational benefits of diversity depend; and to challenge all students to think critically and\nreexamine stereotypes. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 211a; Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 26. These objectives indicate that \"critical mass\" relates to the\nsize of the student body. Id., at 5 (claiming that the Law School has enrolled \"critical mass,\" or \"enough minority students to provide meaningful integration of\nits classrooms and residence halls\"). Respondents further claim that the Law School is achieving \"critical mass.\" Id., at 4 (noting that the Law School's goals\nhave been \"greatly furthered by the presence of . . . a `critical mass' of\" minority students in the student body).\nIn practice, the Law School's program bears little or no relation to its asserted goal of achieving \"critical mass.\" Respondents explain that the Law School\n381 seeks to accumulate a \"critical mass\" of each underrepresented minority *381 group. See, e. g., id., at 49, n. 79 (\"The Law School's . . . current policy . . .\nprovide[s] a special commitment to enrolling a `critical mass' of `Hispanics'\"). But the record demonstrates that the Law School's admissions practices with\nrespect to these groups differ dramatically and cannot be defended under any consistent use of the term \"critical mass.\"\nFrom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted between 1,130 and 1,310 students. Of those, between 13 and 19 were Native American, between 91 and\n108 were African-American, and between 47 and 56 were Hispanic. If the Law School is admitting between 91 and 108 African-Americans in order to achieve\n\"critical mass,\" thereby preventing African-American students from feeling \"isolated or like spokespersons for their race,\" one would think that a number of the\nsame order of magnitude would be necessary to accomplish the same purpose for Hispanics and Native Americans. Similarly, even if all of the Native\nAmerican applicants admitted in a given year matriculate, which the record demonstrates is not at all the case,[*] how can this possibly constitute a \"critical\nmass\" of Native Americans in a class of over 350 students? In order for this pattern of admission to be consistent with the Law School's explanation of \"critical\nmass,\" one would have to believe that the objectives of \"critical mass\" offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics and one-\nsixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African-Americans. But respondents offer no race-specific reasons for such disparities. Instead, they\nsimply emphasize the importance of achieving \"critical mass,\" without any explanation of why that concept is applied differently among the three\nunderrepresented minority groups.\n382 *382 These different numbers, moreover, come only as a result of substantially different treatment among the three under-represented minority groups, as is\napparent in an example offered by the Law School and highlighted by the Court: The school asserts that it \"frequently accepts nonminority applicants with\ngrades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.\" Ante, at 338 (citing Brief for\n\nRespondent Bollinger et al. 10). Specifically, the Law School states that \"[s]ixty-nine minority applicants were rejected between 1995 and 2000 with at least a\n3.5 [Grade Point Average (GPA)] and a [score of] 159 or higher on the [Law School Admission Test (LSAT)]\" while a number of Caucasian and Asian-American\napplicants with similar or lower scores were admitted. Ibid.\nReview of the record reveals only 67 such individuals. Of these 67 individuals, 56 were Hispanic, while only 6 were African-American, and only 5 were Native\nAmerican. This discrepancy reflects a consistent practice. For example, in 2000, 12 Hispanics who scored between a 159-160 on the LSAT and earned a GPA\nof 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 2 were admitted. App. 200-201. Meanwhile, 12 African-Americans in the same range of qualifications applied\nfor admission and all 12 were admitted. Id., at 198. Likewise, that same year, 16 Hispanics who scored between a 151-153 on the LSAT and earned a 3.00 or\nhigher applied for admission and only 1 of those applicants was admitted. Id., at 200-201. Twenty-three similarly qualified African-Americans applied for\nadmission and 14 were admitted. Id., at 198.\nThese statistics have a significant bearing on petitioner's case. Respondents have never offered any race-specific arguments explaining why significantly more\nindividuals from one underrepresented minority group are needed in order to achieve \"critical mass\" or further student body diversity. They certainly have not\n383 explained why Hispanics, who they *383 have said are among \"the groups most isolated by racial barriers in our country,\" should have their admission capped\nout in this manner. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 50. True, petitioner is neither Hispanic nor Native American. But the Law School's disparate admissions\npractices with respect to these minority groups demonstrate that its alleged goal of \"critical mass\" is simply a sham. Petitioner may use these statistics to\nexpose this sham, which is the basis for the Law School's admission of less qualified underrepresented minorities in preference to her. Surely strict scrutiny\ncannot permit these sorts of disparities without at least some explanation.\nOnly when the \"critical mass\" label is discarded does a likely explanation for these numbers emerge. The Court states that the Law School's goal of attaining a\n\"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students is not an interest in merely \"`assur[ing] within its student body some specified percentage of a particular\ngroup merely because of its race or ethnic origin.'\" Ante, at 329 (quoting Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.)). The Court recognizes that such an\ninterest \"would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.\" Ante, at 330. The Court concludes, however, that the Law School's use\nof race in admissions, consistent with Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, only pays \"`[s]ome attention to numbers.'\" Ante, at 336 (quoting Bakke, supra, at 323).\nBut the correlation between the percentage of the Law School's pool of applicants who are members of the three minority groups and the percentage of the\nadmitted applicants who are members of these same groups is far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying \"some attention to\n[the] numbers.\" As the tables below show, from 1995 through 2000 the percentage of admitted applicants who were members of these minority groups closely\ntracked the percentage of individuals in the school's applicant pool who were from the same groups.\n384 *384\n

example, in 1995, when 9.7% of the applicant pool was African-American, 9.4% of the admitted class was African-American. By 2000, only 7.5% of\nthe applicant pool was African-American, and 7.3% of the admitted class was African-American. This correlation is striking. Respondents themselves\nemphasize that the number of underrepresented minority students admitted to the Law School would be significantly smaller if the race of each applicant were\nnot considered. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a; Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 6 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 299a). But, as the examples above\nillustrate, the measure of the decrease would differ dramatically among the groups. The tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees\nof a given race, therefore, must result from careful race based planning by the Law School. It suggests a formula for admission based on the aspirational\nassumption that all applicants are equally qualified academically, and therefore that the proportion of each group admitted should be the same as the\nproportion of that group in the applicant pool. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 43, n. 70 (discussing admissions officers' use of \"periodic reports\" to\ntrack \"the racial composition of the developing class\").\nNot only do respondents fail to explain this phenomenon, they attempt to obscure it. See id., at 32, n. 50 (\"The Law School's minority enrollment percentages .\n. . diverged from the percentages in the applicant pool by as much as 17.7% from 1995-2000\"). But the divergence between the percentages of\nunderrepresented minorities in the applicant pool and in the enrolled classes is not the only relevant comparison. In fact, it may not be the most relevant\ncomparison. The Law School cannot precisely control which of its admitted applicants decide to attend the university. But it can and, as the numbers\ndemonstrate, clearly does employ racial preferences in extending offers of admission. Indeed, the ostensibly flexible nature of the Law School's admissions\n386 program *386 that the Court finds appealing, see ante, at 337-338, appears to be, in practice, a carefully managed program designed to ensure proportionate\nrepresentation of applicants from selected minority groups.\nI do not believe that the Constitution gives the Law School such free rein in the use of race. The Law School has offered no explanation for its actual\nadmissions practices and, unexplained, we are bound to conclude that the Law School has managed its admissions program, not to achieve a \"critical mass,\"\nbut to extend offers of admission to members of selected minority groups in proportion to their statistical representation in the applicant pool. But this is\nprecisely the type of racial balancing that the Court itself calls \"patently unconstitutional.\" Ante, at 330.\nFinally, I believe that the Law School's program fails strict scrutiny because it is devoid of any reasonably precise time limit on the Law School's use of race in\nadmissions. We have emphasized that we will consider \"the planned duration of the remedy\" in determining whether a race-conscious program is\nconstitutional. Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 510 (Powell, J., concurring); see also United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149, 171 (1987) (\"In determining whether race-\nconscious remedies are appropriate, we look to several factors, including the . . . duration of the relief\"). Our previous cases have required some limit on the\nduration of programs such as this because discrimination on the basis of race is invidious.\n\nThe Court suggests a possible 25-year limitation on the Law School's current program. See ante, at 343. Respondents, on the other hand, remain more\nambiguous, explaining that \"[t]he Law School of course recognizes that race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits, and the Sixth Circuit\nproperly found such a limit in the Law School's resolve to cease considering race when genuine race-neutral alternatives become available.\" Brief for\n387 Respondent Bollinger et al. 32. These discussions of a time *387 limit are the vaguest of assurances. In truth, they permit the Law School's use of racial\npreferences on a seemingly permanent basis. Thus, an important component of strict scrutiny—that a program be limited in time—is casually subverted.\nThe Court, in an unprecedented display of deference under our strict scrutiny analysis, upholds the Law School's program despite its obvious flaws. We have\nsaid that when it comes to the use of race, the connection between the ends and the means used to attain them must be precise. But here the flaw is deeper\nthan that; it is not merely a question of \"fit\" between ends and means. Here the means actually used are forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, dissenting.\nThe separate opinion by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 289-291, 315-318 (1978), is based on the principle that a university\nadmissions program may take account of race as one, nonpredominant factor in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual, provided the\nprogram can meet the test of strict scrutiny by the judiciary. This is a unitary formulation. If strict scrutiny is abandoned or manipulated to distort its real and\naccepted meaning, the Court lacks authority to approve the use of race even in this modest, limited way. The opinion by Justice Powell, in my view, states the\ncorrect rule for resolving this case. The Court, however, does not apply strict scrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines both the test and its own\ncontrolling precedents.\nJustice Powell's approval of the use of race in university admissions reflected a tradition, grounded in the First Amendment, of acknowledging a university's\nconception of its educational mission. Id., at 312-314; ante, at 329. Our precedents provide a basis for the Court's acceptance of a university's considered\n388 judgment that racial diversity among *388 students can further its educational task, when supported by empirical evidence. Ante, at 329-331.\nIt is unfortunate, however, that the Court takes the first part of Justice Powell's rule but abandons the second. Having approved the use of race as a factor in\nthe admissions process, the majority proceeds to nullify the essential safeguard Justice Powell insisted upon as the precondition of the approval. The\nsafeguard was rigorous judicial review, with strict scrutiny as the controlling standard. Bakke, supra, at 291 (\"Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are\ninherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination\"). This Court has reaffirmed, subsequent to Bakke, the absolute necessity of strict\nscrutiny when the State uses race as an operative category. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995) (\"[A]ny person, of whatever race,\nhas the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment\nunder the strictest judicial scrutiny\"); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-494 (1989); see id., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (\"[A]ny racial preference must face the most rigorous scrutiny by the courts\"). The Court confuses deference to a university's definition\nof its educational objective with deference to the implementation of this goal. In the context of university admissions the objective of racial diversity can be\naccepted based on empirical data known to us, but deference is not to be given with respect to the methods by which it is pursued. Preferment by race, when\nresorted to by the State, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the idea of\nequality. The majority today refuses to be faithful to the settled principle of strict review designed to reflect these concerns.\n389 The Court, in a review that is nothing short of perfunctory, accepts the University of Michigan Law School's (Law *389 School) assurances that its admissions\nprocess meets with constitutional requirements. The majority fails to confront the reality of how the Law School's admissions policy is implemented. The\ndissenting opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which I join in full, demonstrates beyond question why the concept of critical mass is a delusion used by the Law\nSchool to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas. An effort to\nachieve racial balance among the minorities the school seeks to attract is, by the Court's own admission, \"patently unconstitutional.\" Ante, at 330; see also\nBakke, supra, at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). It remains to point out how critical mass becomes inconsistent with individual consideration in some more specific\naspects of the admissions process.\nAbout 80% to 85% of the places in the entering class are given to applicants in the upper range of Law School Admissions Test scores and grades. An\napplicant with these credentials likely will be admitted without consideration of race or ethnicity. With respect to the remaining 15% to 20% of the seats, race is\nlikely outcome determinative for many members of minority groups. That is where the competition becomes tight and where any given applicant's chance of\nadmission is far smaller if he or she lacks minority status. At this point the numerical concept of critical mass has the real potential to compromise individual\nreview.\nThe Law School has not demonstrated how individual consideration is, or can be, preserved at this stage of the application process given the instruction to\nattain what it calls critical mass. In fact the evidence shows otherwise. There was little deviation among admitted minority students during the years from 1995\nto 1998. The percentage of enrolled minorities fluctuated only by 0.3%, from 13.5% to 13.8%. The number of minority students to whom offers were extended\nvaried by just a slightly greater magnitude of 2.2%, from the high of 15.6% in 1995 to the low of 13.4% in 1998.\n390 *390 The District Court relied on this uncontested fact to draw an inference that the Law School's pursuit of critical mass mutated into the equivalent of a quota.\n137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 851 (ED Mich. 2001). Admittedly, there were greater fluctuations among enrolled minorities in the preceding years, 1987-1994, by as\nmuch as 5% or 6%. The percentage of minority offers, however, at no point fell below 12%, historically defined by the Law School as the bottom of its critical\nmass range. The greater variance during the earlier years, in any event, does not dispel suspicion that the school engaged in racial balancing. The data would\nbe consistent with an inference that the Law School modified its target only twice, in 1991 (from 13% to 19%), and then again in 1995 (back from 20% to 13%).\nThe intervening year, 1993, when the percentage dropped to 14.5%, could be an aberration, caused by the school's miscalculation as to how many applicants\nwith offers would accept or by its redefinition, made in April 1992, of which minority groups were entitled to race-based preference.

Whether the objective of critical mass \"is described as a quota or a goal, it is a line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status,\" and\nso risks compromising individual assessment. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289 (opinion of Powell, J.). In this respect the Law School program compares unfavorably\nwith the experience of Little Ivy League colleges. Amicus Amherst College, for example, informs us that the offers it extended to students of African-American\nbackground during the period from 1993 to 2002 ranged between 81 and 125 out of 950 offers total, resulting in a fluctuation from 24 to 49 matriculated\nstudents in a class of about 425. See Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11. The Law School insisted upon a much smaller fluctuation, both in\nthe offers extended and in the students who eventually enrolled, despite having a comparable class size.\nThe Law School has the burden of proving, in conformance with the standard of strict scrutiny, that it did not utilize race in an unconstitutional way. Adarand\nConstructors, 515 U. S., at 224. At the very least, the constancy of admitted minority students and the close correlation between the racial breakdown of\nadmitted minorities and the composition of the applicant pool, discussed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at 380-386, require the Law School either to produce\na convincing explanation or to show it has taken adequate steps to ensure individual assessment. The Law School does neither.\nThe obvious tension between the pursuit of critical mass and the requirement of individual review increased by the end of the admissions season. Most of the\ndecisions where race may decide the outcome are made during this period. See supra, at 389. The admissions officers consulted the daily reports which\nindicated the composition of the incoming class along racial lines. As Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions from 1991 to 1996, stated, \"the further [he] went\n392 into the [admissions] season the more frequently [he] would *392 want to look at these [reports] and see the change from day-to-day.\" These reports would\n\"track exactly where [the Law School] st[ood] at any given time in assembling the class,\" and so would tell the admissions personnel whether they were short\nof assembling a critical mass of minority students. Shields generated these reports because the Law School's admissions policy told him the racial makeup of\nthe entering class was \"something [he] need[ed] to be concerned about,\" and so he had \"to find a way of tracking what's going on.\" Deposition of Dennis\nShields in Civ. Action No. 97-75928, pp. 129-130, 141 (ED Mich., Dec. 7, 1998).\nThe consultation of daily reports during the last stages in the admissions process suggests there was no further attempt at individual review save for race itself.\nThe admissions officers could use the reports to recalibrate the plus factor given to race depending on how close they were to achieving the Law School's goal\nof critical mass. The bonus factor of race would then become divorced from individual review; it would be premised instead on the numerical objective set by\nthe Law School.\nThe Law School made no effort to guard against this danger. It provided no guidelines to its admissions personnel on how to reconcile individual assessment\nwith the directive to admit a critical mass of minority students. The admissions program could have been structured to eliminate at least some of the risk that\nthe promise of individual evaluation was not being kept. The daily consideration of racial breakdown of admitted students is not a feature of affirmative-action\nprograms used by other institutions of higher learning. The Little Ivy League colleges, for instance, do not keep ongoing tallies of racial or ethnic composition of\ntheir entering students. See Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 10.\n\nTo be constitutional, a university's compelling interest in a diverse student body must be achieved by a system where individual assessment is safeguarded\n393 through the entire process. There is no constitutional objection to the goal of *393 considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve\ndiversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not\nbecome a predominant factor in the admissions decisionmaking. The Law School failed to comply with this requirement, and by no means has it carried its\nburden to show otherwise by the test of strict scrutiny.\nThe Court's refusal to apply meaningful strict scrutiny will lead to serious consequences. By deferring to the law schools' choice of minority admissions\nprograms, the courts will lose the talents and resources of the faculties and administrators in devising new and fairer ways to ensure individual consideration.\nConstant and rigorous judicial review forces the law school faculties to undertake their responsibilities as state employees in this most sensitive of areas with\nutmost fidelity to the mandate of the Constitution. Dean Allan Stillwagon, who directed the Law School's Office of Admissions from 1979 to 1990, explained the\ndifficulties he encountered in defining racial groups entitled to benefit under the Law School's affirmative action policy. He testified that faculty members were\n\"breathtakingly cynical\" in deciding who would qualify as a member of underrepresented minorities. An example he offered was faculty debate as to whether\nCubans should be counted as Hispanics: One professor objected on the grounds that Cubans were Republicans. Many academics at other law schools who\nare \"affirmative action's more forthright defenders readily concede that diversity is merely the current rationale of convenience for a policy that they prefer to\njustify on other grounds.\" Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 1, 34 (2002) (citing Levinson, Diversity, 2 U. Pa. J.\nConst. L. 573, 577-578 (2000); Rubenfeld, Affirmative Action, 107 Yale L. J. 427, 471 (1997)). This is not to suggest the faculty at Michigan or other law\n394 schools do not pursue aspirations they consider laudable and consistent with our constitutional *394 traditions. It is but further evidence of the necessity for\nscrutiny that is real, not feigned, where the corrosive category of race is a factor in decisionmaking. Prospective students, the courts, and the public can\ndemand that the State and its law schools prove their process is fair and constitutional in every phase of implementation.\nIt is difficult to assess the Court's pronouncement that race-conscious admissions programs will be unnecessary 25 years from now. Ante, at 341-343. If it is\nintended to mitigate the damage the Court does to the concept of strict scrutiny, neither petitioner nor other rejected law school applicants will find solace in\nknowing the basic protection put in place by Justice Powell will be suspended for a full quarter of a century. Deference is antithetical to strict scrutiny, not\nconsistent with it.\nAs to the interpretation that the opinion contains its own self-destruct mechanism, the majority's abandonment of strict scrutiny undermines this objective. Were\nthe courts to apply a searching standard to race-based admissions schemes, that would force educational institutions to seriously explore race-neutral\nalternatives. The Court, by contrast, is willing to be satisfied by the Law School's profession of its own good faith. The majority admits as much: \"We take the\nLaw School at its word that it would `like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula' and will terminate its race-conscious admissions\nprogram as soon as practicable.\" Ante, at 343 (quoting Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 34).\nIf universities are given the latitude to administer programs that are tantamount to quotas, they will have few incentives to make the existing minority\nadmissions schemes transparent and protective of individual review. The unhappy consequence will be to perpetuate the hostilities that proper consideration of\n395 race is designed to avoid. The perpetuation, of course, would be the worst of all outcomes. Other programs do exist which will be more effective in *395\nbringing about the harmony and mutual respect among all citizens that our constitutional tradition has always sought. They, and not the program under review\nhere, should be the model, even if the Court defaults by not demanding it.\nIt is regrettable the Court's important holding allowing racial minorities to have their special circumstances considered in order to improve their educational\nopportunities is accompanied by a suspension of the strict scrutiny which was the predicate of allowing race to be considered in the first place. If the Court\nabdicates its constitutional duty to give strict scrutiny to the use of race in university admissions, it negates my authority to approve the use of race in pursuit of\nstudent diversity. The Constitution cannot confer the right to classify on the basis of race even in this special context absent searching judicial review. For these\nreasons, though I reiterate my approval of giving appropriate consideration to race in this one context, I must dissent in the present case.\n[*] Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Florida et al. by Charlie Crist, Attorney General of Florida, Christopher M.

Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), and Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). This case therefore does not\nrequire the Court to revisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether designed to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group, should be subject to\nthe same standard of judicial review. Cf. Gratz, ante, at 301-302 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 274, n. 8 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Nor does this\ncase necessitate reconsideration whether interests other than \"student body diversity,\" ante, at 325, rank as sufficiently important to justify a race-conscious government\nprogram. Cf. Gratz, ante, at 301-302 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 273-274 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n[*] Part VII of JUSTICE THOMAS's opinion describes those portions of the Court's opinion in which I concur. See post, at 374-378 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting\nin part).\n[1] Throughout I will use the two phrases interchangeably.\n[2] The Court's refusal to address Wygant's rejection of a state interest virtually indistinguishable from that presented by the Law School is perplexing. If the Court defers to\nthe Law School's judgment that a racially mixed student body confers educational benefits to all, then why would the Wygant Court not defer to the school board's judgment\nwith respect to the benefits a racially mixed faculty confers?\n[3] \"[D]iversity,\" for all of its devotees, is more a fashionable catchphrase than it is a useful term, especially when something as serious as racial discrimination is at issue.\nBecause the Equal Protection Clause renders the color of one's skin constitutionally irrelevant to the Law School's mission, I refer to the Law School's interest as an\n\"aesthetic.\" That is, the Law School wants to have a certain appearance, from the shape of the desks and tables in its classrooms to the color of the students sitting at them.\nI also use the term \"aesthetic\" because I believe it underlines the ineffectiveness of racially discriminatory admissions in actually helping those who are truly underprivileged.\nCf. Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268, 283 (1979) (noting that suspect classifications are especially impermissible when \"the choice made by the State appears to redound . . . to the\nbenefit of those without need for special solicitude\"). It must be remembered that the Law School's racial discrimination does nothing for those too poor or uneducated to\nparticipate in elite higher education and therefore presents only an illusory solution to the challenges facing our Nation.\n[4] The Law School believes both that the educational benefits of a racially engineered student body are large and that adjusting its overall admissions standards to achieve\nthe same racial mix would require it to sacrifice its elite status. If the Law School is correct that the educational benefits of \"diversity\" are so great, then achieving them by\naltering admissions standards should not compromise its elite status. The Law School's reluctance to do this suggests that the educational benefits it alleges are not\nsignificant or do not exist at all.\n[5] Cf. U. S. News & World Report, America's Best Graduate Schools 28 (2004 ed.) (placing these schools in the uppermost 15 in the Nation).\n[6] The Court refers to this component of the Law School's compelling state interest variously as \"academic quality,\" avoiding \"sacrifice [of] a vital component of its\neducational mission,\" and \"academic selectivity.\" Ante, at 340.\n[7] For example, North Carolina A&T State University, which is currently 5.4% white, College Admissions Data Handbook 643, could seek to reduce the representation of\n\nwhites in order to gain additional educational benefits.\n[8] Cal. Const., Art. 1, § 31(a), states in full:\n\"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation\nof public employment, public education, or public contracting.\" See Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692 (CA9 1997).\n[9] Given the incredible deference the Law School receives from the Court, I think it appropriate to indulge in the presumption that Boalt Hall operates without violating\nCalifornia law.\n[10] Were this Court to have the courage to forbid the use of racial discrimination in admissions, legacy preferences (and similar practices) might quickly become less popular\n—a possibility not lost, I am certain, on the elites(both individual and institutional)supporting the Law School in this case.\n[11] For example, there is no recognition by the Law School in this case that even with their racial discrimination in place, black men are \"underrepresented\" at the Law\nSchool. See ABA-LSAC Guide 426 (reporting that the Law School has 46 black women and 28 black men). Why does the Law School not also discriminate in favor of black\nmen over black women, given this underrepresentation? The answer is, again, that all the Law School cares about is its own image among know-it-all elites, not solving real\nproblems like the crisis of black male underperformance.\n[12] That interest depends on enrolling a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students, as the majority repeatedly states. Ante, at 316, 318, 319, 330, 333, 335, 340;\ncf. ante, at 333 (referring to the unique experience of being a \"racial minority,\" as opposed to being black, or Native American); ante, at 335-336 (rejecting argument that the\nLaw School maintains a disguised quota by referring to the total number of enrolled underrepresented minority students, not specific races). As it relates to the Law School's\nracial discrimination, the Court clearly approves of only one use of race—the distinction between underrepresented minority applicants and those of all other races. A relative\npreference awarded to a black applicant over, for example, a similarly situated Native American applicant, does not lead to the enrollment of even one more\nunderrepresented minority student, but only balances the races within the \"critical mass.\"\n[13] I agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that the Court's holding that racial discrimination in admissions will be illegal in 25 years is not based upon a \"forecast,\" post, at 346\n(concurring opinion). I do not agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG'S characterization of the Court's holding as an expression of \"hope.\" Ibid.\n[14] I use a score of 165 as the benchmark here because the Law School feels it is the relevant score range for applicant consideration (absent race discrimination). See\nBrief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 5; App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a (showing that the median LSAT score for all accepted applicants from 1995-1998 was 168); id., at 310a-\n311a (showing the median LSAT score for accepted applicants was 167 for the years 1999 and 2000); University of Michigan Law School Website, available at http://www.\nlaw.umich.edu/prospectivestudents/Admissions/index.htm (showing that the median LSAT score for accepted applicants in 2002 was 166).\n[15] The majority's non sequitur observation that since 1978 the number of blacks that have scored in these upper ranges on the LSAT has grown, ante, at 343, says nothing\nabout current trends. First, black participation in the LSAT until the early 1990's lagged behind black representation in the general population. For instance, in 1984 only 7.3%\nof law school applicants were black, whereas in 2000 11.3% of law school applicants were black. See LSAC Statistical Reports (1984 and 2000). Today, however, unless\nblacks were to begin applying to law school in proportions greater than their representation in the general population, the growth in absolute numbers of high scoring blacks\nshould be expected to plateau, and it has. In 1992, 63 black applicants to law school had LSAT scores above 165. In 2000, that number was 65. See LSAC Statistical\nReports (1992 and 2000).\n[16] I use the LSAT as an example, but the same incentive structure is in place for any admissions criteria, including undergraduate grades, on which minorities are\nconsistently admitted at thresholds significantly lower than whites.\n[*] Indeed, during this 5-year time period, enrollment of Native American students dropped to as low as three such students. Any assertion that such a small group\nconstituted a \"critical mass\" of Native Americans is simply absurd.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Granholm is the Attorney General of Michigan.  The \nAttorney General of Michigan is a constitutional officer elected by the people.  Mich. \nConst. 1963, art. 5, § 21.  In addition to her authority under Michigan's Constitution, \nfederal courts have recognized that Michigan's Attorney General has broad statutory \nand common law authority to act on behalf of the people of the State of Michigan \nand to appear in any cause that may be of interest to the people generally.  State of \nMichigan v.  C.  R.  Equipment Sales, Inc., 898 Supp. 509, 513-514 (W.O. Mich. 1995); \nHumphrey v.  Kleinhardt,  157 F.R.D. 404, 405 (W.O. Mich. 1994).  See Mich. Comp. \nLaws Ann. 14.28 and 14.101. \nAmong the issues to be decided in this case is whether the admissions policy \nof the University of Michigan Law School -- a policy that includes consideration of \nrace and ethnic origin as one of a broad array of factors in making admission \ndecisions -- is constitutional.  That policy seeks to effectuate the University's best \njudgment that having a racially and ethnically diverse student body is essential to \nfulfilling its educational mission.  Because Michigan law jealously guards against \nany interference with the educational autonomy specially conferred on Michigan's \nuniversities by constitution, this case is unquestionably of interest to the people of \nthe State of Michigan and warrants the appearance of the Attorney General. \nMoreover, it cannot seriously be disputed that providing an education to \ntheir citizens is one of the most important functions performed by state and local \ngovernments.  The critical importance of protecting state control over education \nfrom encroachment by the federal judiciary where that control represents a \nconstitutionally justifiable policy choice is an additional vital interest of the people \nof the State of Michigan the Attorney General seeks to uphold by filing this amicus \nbrief. \n1 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 7 of 20    Pg ID 999\nINTRODUCTION \nIn the seminal case of Regents of the  University of California  v.  Bakke, 438 \nU.S. 265 (1978), the United States Supreme Court held that a university's properly \ndevised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and \nethnic origin did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Id. at 320, 328 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by Brennan, White, \nMarshall, and Blackmun, JJ.)  Justice Powell's controlling opinion in Bakke \nexamined each of the goals asserted by the university in defense of its use of race in \nits admissions process and concluded that only one -- obtaining the educational \nbenefits that flow from a diverse student body -- was constitutionally permissible. \nId. at 311-312 (opinion of Powell, J.)l  In so ruling, Justice Powell relied on the \nCourt's long-honored doctrine of \"academic freedom,\" grounded in the First \nAmendment, and recognized the right of educational institutions to engage in \nacademic decisionmaking with limited judicial interference based on the unique \nand vital role they play in a democratic society.  Id. at 312-313 (opinion of Powell, J.)2 \nIn this case, the University of Michigan Law School has devised an \nadmissions policy that takes race and ethnic origin into account as one of many \n1  A number of distinguished amici curiae have thoroughly addressed the point that \nenrolling a diverse student body is a compelling interest that institutions of higher \neducation may further -- consistent with the Equal Protection Clause -- with an \nadmissions program that considers race as one element to achieve that result.  The \nAttorney General will not repeat those arguments in this brief, but rather \nrecommends the able briefing of her fellow amici to this Court. \n2  Justice Powell's opinion is controlling with regard to its statements that rely on \nthe First Amendment's protection of academic freedom because it garnered the \nsupport of four justices of the Brennan plurality.  They noted that California law \nhad vested plenary legislative and administrative power in the University of \nCalifornia's Board of Regents and that nothing in the Equal Protection Clause \njustified limiting the scope of their power to make academic choices.  Bakke, 438 \nU.S. at 366, n. 42 (opinion of Brennan, J.) \n2 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 8 of 20    Pg ID 1000\nfactors in making admissions decisions and has done so based on its judgment that \nenrolling a racially diverse student body is essential to providing a quality legal \neducation to its students.  This amicus brief defends the University's right to make \nthat academic choice and urges this Court to follow Justice Powell's controlling \nopinion in Bakke as an eminently sound and correct statement of constitutional \nprinciples) \nAdditionally, this brief urges this Court to pay deference to the University's \nacademic decisionmaking based not only on federal constitutional principles, but \nalso based on Michigan's Constitution.  Since 1850, Michigan's Constitution has \nconferred a unique status on public universities.  Michigan has made the conscious \nchoice to place authority over the operation of the University of Michigan in its \nBoard of Regents and has consistently and strictly forbidden any encroachment on \nthe university's educational autonomy.  Mich. Const. 1850, art. 13, § 8; Mich. Const. \n1963, art. 8, § 5.  As Michigan law has afforded universities the same freedom to \npursue their educational mission as has the federal law, this brief urges this Court to \nconsider Michigan's Constitution as an additional basis for upholding the \nUniversity's admissions policy choices in this case. \n3  This brief addresses only the legal question of whether institutional autonomy \napplies to the University's admissions choice.  It is beyond the scope of this amicus \nbrief to address the evidence presented in this case and whether the University's \nactual implementation of its admissions policy is narrowly tailored to meet its \ncompelling interest in achieving a diverse student body. \n3 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 9 of 20    Pg ID 1001\nARGUMENTS \nI. \nTHE UNIVERSITY'S CHOICE TO SEEK TO ATTAIN A DIVERSE \nSTUDENT BODY TO ADVANCE ITS EDUCATIONAL MISSION \nFALLS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY AFFORDED \nBY THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND IS, THEREFORE, \nPERMISSIBLE UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. \n\"[F]rom Thomas Jefferson onwards,\" the connection between education and \nthe endurance of our democracy has been unquestionable.  Wieman v.  Updegraff, \n344 U.S. 183, 196 (1952) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)  The Supreme Court has \nconsistently sounded the theme that education is of crucial importance to our \npolitical system and \"fulfills a most fundamental obligation of government to its \nconstituency.\"  Ambach v.  Norwick, 441  U.S. 68, 76 (1979) (quoting Foley v. \nConnelie, 435 U.S. 291, 297 (1978)).  Among the primary purposes of education is to \nprepare \"individuals for participation as citizens.\"  Id .  (citing Brown v.  Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954)).  Indeed, of all the functions served by state and \nlocal governments, \"education is perhaps the most important.\"  Brown, 347 U.S. at \n493. \nFrom this profound appreciation and respect for education in our democratic \nsystem has flowed a natural corollary of judicial deference to educational \ndecisionmaking crystallizing in the doctrine of \"academic freedom.\"  The \nfoundation for this doctrine was eloquently described by Justice Frankfurter in his \nconcurring opinion in Sweezy v.  New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957), where he \nfirst enumerated the often-quoted \"four essential freedoms\" of a university: \nIt is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is \nmost conducive to speculation, experiment and creation.  It is an \natmosphere in which there prevail \"the four essential freedoms\" of a \nuniversity -- to determine for itself on academic grounds who may \nteach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be \nadmitted to study. \n4 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 10 of 20    Pg ID 1002\nIn Sweezy, the Court was called upon to decide whether the due process rights \nof Paul Sweezy, a lecturer at the university, had been violated when he was jailed \nfor contempt after refusing on First Amendment grounds to cooperate with the \nState's investigation into subversive activities.  In finding an invasion of Sweezy's \nliberties, Chief Justice Warren, who issued the decision of the Court, cautioned that \nthe areas of political expression and \"academic freedom\" were areas in which \n\"government should be extremely reticent to tread.\"  Id. at 250.  He explained that \n\"[t]he essentiality of freedom in the community of American universities is almost \nself-evident.  No one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is \nplayed by those who guide and train our youth.\"  Id.  In his concurrence, Justice \nFrankfurter emphasized that a free society depends on free universities, meaning \n\"the exclusion of governmental intervention in the intellectual life of a university.\" \nId. at 262 (Opinion of Frankfurter, J.). \nThis same point was made later by Justice Douglas in Griswold v. \nConnecticut, 381 U.S. 379, 482-483 (1965) where he premised protection for academic \nfreedom on the First Amendment: \nIn other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the \nFirst Amendment, contract the spectrum of available  knowledge.  The \nright of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter \nor to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to \nread ... and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to \nteach ... -- indeed. the freedom of the entire university community . \n... Without those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less \nsecure.  (citations omitted) (emphasis added) \nA decade after Sweezy was decided the doctrine of academic freedom became \neven more clearly grounded in the First Amendment in the case of Keyishian v. \nBoard of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967).  In Keyishian, the Court struck down a state \nstatute that required faculty members to sign certificates stating that they were not \n5 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 11 of 20    Pg ID 1003\nCommunists.  In balancing the State's interest in assuring its teachers were not \n\"subversives\" against the faculty's right to academic freedom, the Court spoke in \nbroad terms recognizing that some areas of society should be free of excessive \ninterference to function effectively: \nOur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, \nwhich is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the \nteachers concerned.  That freedom is therefore a special concern of the \nFirst Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of \northodoxy over the classroom.  \"The vigilant protection of \nconstitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community \nof American schools.\" ... The classroom is peculiarly the \"marketplace \nof ideas.\"  The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through \nwide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth \n\"out of a multitude of tongues, (rather) than through any kind of \nauthoritative selection.\" \n385 U.S. at 603 (citation omitted). \nAgainst this backdrop, Justice Powell's controlling opinion in Bakke is seen as \na natural and principled application of the recurring constitutional thread that had \nbeen woven since Brown v.  Board of Education.  In ruling that the University of \nCalifornia's goal of attaining a racially diverse student body was constitutionally \npermissible, Justice Powell correctly relied on the academic freedom doctrine, noting \nthat it had \"long ... been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" \nBakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.)  He also appropriately drew on the \n\"four essential freedoms\" of a university that were summarized in Sweezy, \nincluding the freedom \"to determine for itself on academic grounds ... who may be \nadmitted to study,\" in concluding that \"the freedom of a university to make its own \njudgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.\"  Id.  In short, \nBakke permits universities as separate autonomous entities to rely on First \nAmendment guarantees to protect their right (and freedom) to make academic \n6 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 12 of 20    Pg ID 1004\ndecisions.4 \nAll these cases, taken together, serve to recognize the unique status of \neducational institutions in our democratic society and to counsel that courts should \npay special deference to the expertise of those involved in academic decisionmaking \nto assure them the greatest chance for success in furthering their educational \nmission. \nIn the case of Regents of the University of Michigan  v.  Ewing, 474 U.S. 214 \n(1985), the Court made clear that academic freedom was a doctrine that applied not \nonly to individuals, but to educational institutions as well, and to the University of \nMichigan in particular.  In Ewing, plaintiff, who was dismissed from the \nuniversity's accelerated medical school program based on a negative evaluation of \nhis academic credentials, claimed he had a protectable property interest in continued \nenrollment.  Even assuming such an interest, however, the Court, citing Bakke, \nKeyishian, and Sweezy, stated its \"reluctance to trench on the prerogatives of state \nand local educational institutions\" and acknowledged a \"responsibility to safeguard \ntheir academic freedom\" as a special concern of the First Amendment.  Id. at 226 \n(citations omitted).  The Court stressed that \"[a]cademic freedom thrives not only on \nthe independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students \nbut also ... on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself.\"  Id. at 226 n. 12 \n(citation omitted). \nJustice Powell's concurring opinion was even more explicit.  He agreed fully \nwith the Court's emphasis on the \"respect and deference that courts should accord \nacademic decisions made by the appropriate university authorities\" and \nadmonished that judicial review of academic decisions, including admission \n4  For a thorough discussion on academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and the \nattainment of a diverse student body, see Darlene C. Goring, Affirmative Action and \nthe First Amendment:  The Attainment of a Diverse Student Body is a Permissible \nExercise of Institutional Autonomy. 47 U. Kan. L. Rev. 491 (1999). \n7 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 13 of 20    Pg ID 1005\ndecisions, \"is rarely appropriate.\"  Id. at 230 (Opinion of Powell, J.)5 \nIn these cases, the Supreme Court has charted a clear course that this Court \nshould follow in evaluating the University of Michigan Law School's admissions \npolicy in this case-- deference.  Consistently, the Court has respected and deferred to \nthe specialized judgments made by our educational institutions -- including \njudgments relating to the composition of a student body -- and has expressed its \nview that universities, not courts, are best entrusted with the crucial job of assuring \nthat our Nation's \"marketplace of ideas\" continues to thrive. \nIndeed, courts across the country, including the Sixth Circuit, have followed \nthe doctrine of institutional academic freedom, or \"institutional autonomy,\" \nembodied in these cases.  See,  e.g.,  Lovelace  v.  Southeastern  Massachusetts \n5  The Court in Ewing cited Board of Curators of the  University of Missouri v. \nHorowitz, 436 U.S. 78 (1978), a case in which the Court upheld the university's \ndismissal of a medical student based on an evaluation showing poor performance. \nIn so ruling, Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court acknowledged that academic \ndecisions requiring an expert evaluation of cumulative information are \"not readily \nadapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.\"  Id. at \n90. \nExplaining a possible underpinning of the court's deference to universities, one \nscholar has noted that the doctrine of institutional academic freedom may have its \nroots in common law academic abstention: \nThe constitutional right of institutional academic freedom appears to \nbe a collateral descendent of the common law notion of academic \nabstention.  This heritage is made explicit in [Ewing], where the Court \n... suggests that these views recommend themselves as protection for \nacademic freedom.  And the 'four freedoms' of Sweezy reflect the kinds \nof university decisions courts have refused to review under common \nlaw principles.  Institutional academic freedom can be viewed as \nacademic abstention raised to constitutional status .... \nJ. Peter Byrne, Academic Freedom:  A \"Special Concern of the First \nAmendment,\" 99 Yale L. J. 251, 326-27 (1989) (footnotes omitted). \nHe goes on to summarize cases like Horowitz as counseling courts to appreciate \n\"that universities proceed on assumptions different from society as a whole and that \nan insistence by courts on conforming to legal standards or procedures will likely \ndestroy something uniquely valuable in higher education.\"  Id.  at 326. \n8 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 14 of 20    Pg ID 1006\nUniversity, 793 F.2d 419, 426 (1st Cir. 1986) (university's decision not to renew faculty \nmember's contract for his alleged failure to inflate grades and to lower academic \nstandards upheld, court emphasizing that university has a recognized right to \ngovern its institution according to the \"four essential freedoms\" that superseded the \nindividual faculty member's right to academic freedom); Doherty v.  Southern \nCollege of Optometry, 862 F.2d 570, 576 (6th Cir. 1988) (affirming dismissal of \nplaintiff's breach of contract claim in a disability discrimination case because it \n\"arises in an academic context where judicial intervention in any form should be \nundertaken only with great reluctance\"); Martin v. Helstad, 578 F. Supp, 1473, 1482 \n(W.O. Wise. 1983) (\"[a]cademic institutions are accorded great deference in their \nfreedom to determine who may be admitted to study at the institution\"). \nThere is, however, one exception, which warrants brief mention -- Hopwood \nv. State of Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996).  In \nHopwood, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the University of Texas Law School could not \nuse race as a factor in its law school admissions to further its goal of achieving \ndiversity in its student body.  The Fifth Circuit explicitly rejected the university's \nreliance on Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, stating \"[it] is not binding precedent \non this issue.\"  Id. at 944.  Hopwood's reasoning, however, is severely flawed and \nindeed, internally inconsistent, and this Court should not be misguided by it. \nFirst, and perhaps most significantly, Judge Smith's opinion6 in Hopwood \noffers so little considered analysis of the university's First Amendment institutional \nautonomy defense as to have virtually ignored it.  In a short footnote, the panel \ndismisses the university's First Amendment right to assemble the student body of \n6  Judges Smith and DeMoss joined in the lead opinion, but Judge Wiener filed a \nspecial concurring opinion in which he disagreed with the panel's conclusion that \ndiversity can never be a compelling governmental interest in a public graduate \nschool, 78 F.3d 932, 962 (opinion of Wiener, concurring).  He would have assumed \nwithout deciding that diversity is a compelling state interest and would have \nproceeded to then address the issue of whether implementation of the university's \npolicy was narrowly tailored to meet its diversity interest. \n9 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 15 of 20    Pg ID 1007\nits choice as \"somewhat troubling,\" but then makes no attempt to refute it on any \nlegal basis except to distinguish Sweezy as involving individual, not institutional, \nacademic rights.  78 F.3d at 943, n. 25.  On this point the panel makes no mention of \nEwing and its explicit statement regarding institutional rights.  Second, the panel \ninexplicably begins its analysis with a statement that, subsequent to Bakke, \n\"Supreme Court decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state \ninterests will never justify racial classifications\" and yet nowhere in its opinion are \nany such cases identified or analyzed.  Indeed, only cases such as Adarand \nContractors,  Inc.  v.  Pena,7 515 U.S. 200 (1995) and City of Richmond v.  f.A.  Croson \nCo., 488 U.S. 469 (1989) are discussed which the panel then characterizes as having \nimplicitly \"overruled\" Bakke,  despite the panel's own quotation of Justice \nO'Connor's concurrence in Wygant v.  Jackson  Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267, 286 \n(1986), in which she noted that a \"state interest in the promotion of racial diversity \nhas been found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher education, \nto support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.\"  78 F.3d at 945, \nn. 27 (emphasis added).  Obviously, cases like Croson and Adarand (dealing with \nhighway construction and government contracting) do not implicate the kind of \nconstitutional protections appropriate in the educational contextS and, accordingly, \nare of little value to this Court. \n7  Further question about Hopwood's soundness is raised considering that Metro \nBroadcasting, Inc.  v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 568 (1990) (overruled by Adarand on other \ngrounds) cites Bakke for the proposition that a diverse student body contributing to \na \"robust exchange of ideas\" is a constitutionally permissible goal on which a race \nconscious university admissions program may be predicated. \n8  Judge Wiener's concurring opinion in Hopwood identifies this very flaw in the \npanel's opinion, concluding that \"[t]his unique context [constructing an entering \nclass at a public graduate or professional school], first identified by Justice Powell, \ndiffers from the employment context, differs from the minority business set aside \ncontext, and differs from the redistricting context; it comprises only the public \nhigher education context ....\"   78 F.3d at 965, n. 21. \n10 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 16 of 20    Pg ID 1008\nHopwood stands alone and should not be followed by this Court. \nThe \"essentiality of freedom\" in American universities is as self-evident \ntoday as it was in 1957 when Sweezy was decided.  The First Amendment protects \nthe University of Michigan Law School's admissions decisionmaking process \nagainst undue judicial interference and, accordingly, this Court, consistent with \nBakke and the Fourteenth Amendment, should defer to the University's policy \nchoice to attain a diverse student body in this case. \nII. \nTHE UNIVERSITY'S CHOICE TO ENROLL A DIVERSE \nSTUDENT BODY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO DEFERENCE \nUNDER ARTICLE 8. § 5 OF MICHIGAN'S CONSTITUTION. \nLike the California educational system discussed in Bakke, (see footnote 2, \nsupra) Michigan is one of the states that has devised its system of higher education \nbased on an abiding conviction that university autonomy best serves the goal of \neducating  its citizens.9  Toward that end, Michigan's Constitution confers a unique \nconstitutional status on its public universities and their governing boards. \nSpecifically, art 8, § 5 of Michigan's Constitution vests plenary authority over \neducational matters in the University of Michigan's Board of Regents in the \nfollowing provision: \nThe regents of the University of Michigan and their successors \nin office shall constitute a body corporate known as the Regents of the \nUniversity of Michigan ... [The] board shall have general supervision \nof its institution and the control and direction of all expenditures from \nthe institution's funds .... \n9  In fact, the State of Michigan enacted our nation's first constitutional provision \nfor the separate government of its state university (the University of Michigan) in \n1850.  Mich. Const. 1850, art 13, § 8.  See Byrne, supra note 5, 99 Yale L.J. at 327-328. \n11 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 17 of 20    Pg ID 1009\nThis conviction that institutional autonomy is necessary to achieve quality \neducation is based on more than faith; it is grounded in experience.  Under \nMichigan's 1835 Constitution, the Legislature controlled and managed the \nUniversity of Michigan, our State's first public university.  Mich. Const. 1935, art. 10, \n§ 5.  This experiment failed, however, and prompted extensive debate about the \nfuture of the University at the Constitutional Convention of 1850.  Federated \nPublications,  Inc.  v.  Michigan  State  University,  Board of Trustees, 460 Mich. 75, 85 \n(1999) (citing Sterling v.  Regents of the  University of Michigan,  110 Mich. 369, 374-\n378 (1896)).  What emerged out of these debates was a consensus that the Legislature \nshould be divested of its power and that control of the university should be placed \nin an elected board.  Under this new system lead by a board of regents, the \nUniversity thrived.l0  Sterling, 110 Mich. at 377.  The regent system has been in place \never since, Mich. Const. 1963, art. 8, § 5, and the University of Michigan has \ncontinued to maintain its position as one of our country's finest educational \n10  Michigan's Supreme Court has described the status of university governing \nboards as: \nthe highest form of juristic person known to the law, a constitutional \ncorporation of independent authority, which, within the scope of its \nfunctions, is coordinate with and equal to that of the legislature. \nBoard  of Regents  of the  University  of Michigan  v.  Auditor General, 167 \nMich. 444, 450 (1911) (quoted approvingly in Federated Publications, 460 \nMich. at 84, n. 8.) \n12 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 18 of 20    Pg ID 1010\ninstitutions. II \nThat the University enjoys full autonomy over educational matters is a \nmatter that was unequivocally confirmed in the recent Federated  Publications case. \nThere, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the Legislature did not have the \npower to regulate open meetings for universities in the context of presidential \nsearches without unconstitutionally infringing on their power to supervise their \ninstitutions.  Federated  Publications,  460 Mich at 78. \nIn so ruling, the Court reiterated the principle it had \"long recognized\" that \nlegislative regulation that encroaches on the university's educational autonomy \n\"must ... yield to the university's constitutional power.\"  Id. at 86-87.  The Court \nobserved that the constitution grants university governing boards authority over \n'\"the absolute management of the University' and that the Court has 'jealously \nguarded' these powers from legislative interference.\"  Id. at 87 (citing State Board of \nAgriculture v.  Auditor General, 226 Mich. 417, 424 (1924) and Board of Control of \nEastern  Michigan  University v.  Labor Mediation  Board, 384 Mich. 561, 565 (1971)). \nAlthough universities may be subject to certain state laws (such as the public \nemployees relations act), even those laws \"cannot extend into the university's \nsphere of educational authority.  ...\"   Federated  Publications, 460 Mich. at 87-88. \nSimilarly, even in the appropriations process, although the Legislature may attach \n11  As explained by Professor Byrne: \nWhen Michigan constitutionalized institutional autonomy in 1850, it \ndid so against a history of frustrating failures to establish respectable \nstate universities in America.  ...The legislature was perceived to \nmanage the university for practical, political ends, rather than for long \nterm scholarly and educational objectives.  The solution adopted -- the \nelection for eight year terms of officials responsible only for university \ngovernance -- was an ingenious innovation, accommodating \nconflicting values and fostering a university known and admired \nthroughout the world. \nByrne, supra note 5, 99 Yale L. J. at 328-329. \n13 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 19 of 20    Pg ID 1011\nconditions to an appropriation, those conditions \"cannot invade university \nautonomy.\"  Id. at 88 citing State Board of Agriculture, 226 Mich at 425.  In short, \n\"[w]ithin the confines of the operation ... of the University, it is supreme.\"  Id. at 87 \n(citation omitted). \nCertainly decisions regarding the composition of a university's student body \nare quintessentially within the educational sphere and may not be infringed under \nstate law.  Like Sweezy's \"four essential freedoms,\" the decision regarding who may \nbe admitted to study is, at its core, an academic one. \nAccordingly, as prevails under principles of federal constitutional law, this \nCourt should defer to the University's admissions choices in this case under \nprinciples of state constitutional law as well. \n14 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 246   Filed 11/29/00   Pg 20 of 20    Pg ID 1012\nCONCLUSION AND RELIEF \nBoth the First Amendment of the federal constitution and article 8, § 5 of \nMichigan's Constitution confer on the University of Michigan a right as a separate \nautonomous entity to make academic choices with only limited judicial scrutiny. \nThe importance of preserving that \"essential freedom\" of the university cannot be \noverstated.  The University's choice to seek to enroll a diverse student body to \nprovide the best educational experience for its students falls squarely within the \nprotection afforded by the doctrine of institutional autonomy and should therefore \nbe held constitutionally permissible by this Court. \nFor all the above reasons, the Attorney General urges this Court to uphold \nthe University's choice to enroll a diverse student body as constitutionally \npermissible under the doctrine of institutional autonomy both as a matter of federal \nand state law. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJENNIFER M.

The doctrine protecting the recipients offederal funds from being sued for \nmoney damages where it is not \"obvious\" that they will be liable in damages applies to the \ndamages claim against the Board of Regents under Title VI.

Whether the defendants arc entitled to summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims \nbecause the undisputed factual record shows that the admissions practices of the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School -- which involve the \"competitive consideration of \nrace\" as a \"single though important factor\" in order to achieve the benefits of a diverse \nstudent body-- comport with the standards set out in Justice Powell's controlling opinion \nin Regents of tile University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). \n2.  Whether the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan is entitled to summary \njudgment on plaintiff's damages claims brought under Title VI because it would not have \nbeen \"obvious\" to the Board of Regents that, by accepting federal funds, it was subjecting \nitself to liability in damages on account of an admissions system that complies fully with \nJustice Powell's controlling opinion in Regents of tile University of California v.

The United States Supreme Court so held in Regents oft he \nUniversity ofC  alifornia v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), stating that a \"State has a substantial \ninterest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the \ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.\" /d. at 320.  The Court recognized in Bakke \nthat achieving the educational benefits of a racially and ethnically diverse student body is a \ncompelling interest.  And, since that decision, institutions of higher education across the country \n--including the University of Michigan and its Law School-- have established admissions \nprograms and policies that usc race as one of many factors in admissions decisions.  Over and \nover again, these institutions have found that the educational benefits that flow from having a \nstudent body consisting of individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences enhance their \nrespective educational missions by fostering vibrant intellectual debate and the exchange of ideas \nand perspectives. \nPlaintiff Barbara Gruttcr and her class now seck to change the law pertaining to \nthe consideration of race as a factor in admissions.  They urge this Court to disregard completely \nthe Supreme Court's holding in Bakke and to find that any consideration of race in admissions \nviolates the Constitution.  This Court should deny plaintiff's request.  In the years since it \ndecided Bakke, the Supreme Court has never overruled or even reconsidered its decision in that \ncase.  The Fifth Circuit is the only appellate court to conclude that a university may not seck to \nobtain the educational benefits of diversity by considering race and ethnicity as one of many \nfactors to enroll a diverse group of students.  That Court's Hopwood decision invalidating the \nadmissions program formerly in usc at the University of Texas Law School, however, has been \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 17 of 65    Pg ID 747\nwidely criticized as wrong and beyond its power.  The Sixth Circuit, in contrast, has consistently \nrecognized Bakke as controlling authority. \nThis Court is not free to ignore Bakke or the unbroken line of authority on which \nit is grounded, which recognizes the discretion and academic \"freedom of a university to make \nits own judgments as to ... the selection of its student body\"·· including how to foster \"[t]he \natmosphere of 'speculation, experiment and creation\"' that is \"so essential to the quality of \nhigher education,\"  id. at 312 (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) \n(Frankfurter, J. , concurring)).  The Supreme Court has long noted the fact that universities, \nthrough the educational judgments they make concerning everything from admissions to \ncurriculum issues, play a unique role in encouraging the expression of diverse voices.  See, e.g., \nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors oft he Univ. ofVa., 515 U.S. 819, 835 (1995) (noting that, in \nthe university setting, the government \"acts against a background of thought and experiment that \nis at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition\"); Regents oft he University of \nMichigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214,226 n.12 (1985) (holding that academic freedom \"thrives ... \non the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students,\" as well as \non \"autonomous dccisionmaking by the academy itself'); Keyishian v. Board ofR  egents, 385 \nU.S. 589,603 (1967) (emphasizing the importance of education and the nation's commitment \"to \nsafeguarding academic freedom which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the \nteachers concerned\"). \nThere is no basis in law, or in the undisputed factual record, to tamper with the \nmanner in which the University of Michigan Law School has exercised its discretion.  The \nundisputed facts contained in the extensive record developed in the nearly three years since \nplaintiff first filed her Complaint reveal that the Law School has consistently and conscientiously \n2 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 18 of 65    Pg ID 748\ncomplied with the standards set forth in the Court's decision in Balcke.  It enrolls only qualified \nindividuals and docs not employ racial quotas or targets in selecting an entering class of diverse \nindividuals each year.  Indeed, it applies only what Bakke squarely permits --the competitive \nconsideration of race as one of many factors in deciding who among the many individuals who \napply each year should be admitted.  Defendants therefore renew their motion for summary \njudgment on plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, and for money damages \nagainst the Board of Regents.  Like the individual defendants whose renewed motion for \nsummary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity has already been filed with this Court,11 \nthey arc entitled to summary judgment on all of plaintiffs claims. \nSTATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS \nThe University of Michigan is a government institution created by the constitution \nof the State of Michigan, see Mich. Canst., art. 8, § 4.  The University of Michigan Board of \nRegents is tl1e body responsible for making decisions concerning ilie University and the vast \narray of undergraduate colleges, graduate programs, and professional schools of which it \nconsists.  See Mich. Canst., art. 8, § 5.  One of those professional schools, the University of \nJJ \nThe parties have filed a series of memoranda in support of or in opposition to \nsummary judgment in this case.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment on Liability, May 3, I999; Defendants' Memorandum of Law in \nSupport of Motion for Summary Judgment, May 3, I 999; Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment, May 28, I 999; Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, May 30, I999.  On June I4, 2000, defendants filed \na renewed motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds on behalf of the \nindividual defendants in this case.  See Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support of \nRenewed Motion by Defendants Bollinger, Lehman, and Shields for Summary Judgment on \nGrounds of Qualified Immunity, June I4, 2000.  That motion has been fully briefed and is now \npending before the Court.  See, e.g.,  Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to the Renewed \nMotion by Defendants Bollinger, Lehman, and Shields for Summary Judgment on Grounds of \nQualified Immunity, July I8, 2000; Defendants' Reply in Support of Renewed Motion by \nDefendants Bollinger, Lehman, and Shields for Summary Judgment on Grounds of Qualified \nImmunity, August I I, 2000. \n3 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 19 of 65    Pg ID 749\nMichigan Law School, has emerged as one of the nation's premier law schools.  Founded in \n1859, the Law School enrolls approximately 1200 students and \"offers a curriculum that prepares \nits students for legal practice anywhere in the United States and throughout much of the world.\" \nEx. A at 8-9.z1 That curriculum \"reflects the view that a life in the law calls for knowledge and \ncapacities which cannot be reduced to a single set.\" /d. at 9.  Thus, while the Law School admits \nonly those applicants likely to succeed, it docs not simply rank order the applicants with the \nhighest undergraduate grade point averages and standardized test scores in choosing the best \nentering class possible.  Instead, the Law School \"encourages independence and diversity of \nthought, which together provide the most solid intellectual and ethical basis for any professional \ncareer.\"  /d. \nThe process of assembling a student body that embodies these characteristics \nrequires a broad range of objective and subjective judgments to select students from a wide range \nof diverse backgrounds who arc intellectually gifted, highly motivated, and independent-minded, \nand who arc likely to become deeply committed professionals.  To serve these objectives, one of \nthe many factors that the Law School considers in admissions is how an individual applicant will \ncontribute to the racial and ethnic diversity of the class.  The Law School achieves the degree of \nracial and ethnic diversity that it now enjoys without using quotas, set asides, separate \nadmissions systems, or any other technique that is even arguably proscribed by the Bakke \ndecision.  As the extensive record developed in this case indicates, the Law School has strictly \nadhered to the standards outlined in the Court's decision in that case. \nZl \nThe documents and materials cited in this Memorandum arc reproduced in \nVolume I of the Appendix hereto, and arc cited, e.g., as \"Ex. A at_.\" Referenced deposition \ntestimony, organized by deponent, is reproduced in Volume 2 of the Appendix, and is cited, e.g., \nas \"Wong Dcp. at_.\" Expert witness reports arc reproduced in Volume 3 of the Appendix and \narc cited, e.g., as \"Steele Expert Rep. at_.\" \n4 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 20 of 65    Pg ID 750\n1.  The Faculty Admissions Policy. \nSince 1992, and therefore at all times relevant to this lawsuit, the criteria \nemployed by Law School officials in rendering admissions decisions have been set forth in the \nLaw School's Admissions Policy (\"the Policy\"), sec Ex. D, which was adopted by vote of the \nLaw School faculty on April22, 1992, on the recommendation of the Faculty Admissions \nCommittee? The Law School faculty adopted and implemented the 1992 Policy well aware that \nany admissions decisions made by the Law School had to comply with the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Bakke.  Bollinger Dep. at 45-46.  The Policy explains why the Law School values a \ndiverse student body; why racial diversity is an important aspect of the overall diversity that the \nLaw School seeks to achieve; and the steps the Law School's admissions office should take to \nachieve that diversity. \nIn the years prior to 1992, no single document outlined the Law School's \nadmissions policies or articulated the educational values to be served by tl1e admissions process. \nA few resolutions from the 1960s and 1970s had established a \"special admissions\" program that \nset a target range for the number of underrepresented minority students that the Law School \nwould seck to enroll, but these aspects of the prior admissions policy, among others, were \neliminated by the adoption of the 1992 Admissions Policy.  Shaw Dep. at 138-42.  The 1991-92 \nFaculty Admissions Committee decided, after discussing ilie issue, not to include any goal or \nThe Faculty Admissions Committee was convened during the 1991-92 school \nyear by then-Dean Bollinger \"to examine the [admissions] policy, to tl1ink about what our \neducational views and values were and what was required under the Constitution and tlle Jaw.\" \nBollinger Dep. at II 0.  Over the course of discovery in this case, plaintiff has deposed every \nmember of the Faculty Admissions Committee.  Those committee members include:  Professor \n(now Dean) Jeffrey S. Lehman, Professors Donald Herzog, Richard 0. Lempert, Donald H. \nRegan, then-Professor Theodore M. Shaw, then-Assistant Dean and Director of Admissions \nDennis J. Shields, and then-Associate Dean for Student Affairs Susan M. Eklund. \n5 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 21 of 65    Pg ID 751\ntarget for the admission of underrepresented minorities in the new admissions policy.  Shields \nDep. at 10 7-08.  Instead, the Policy describes the traits, qualities, and characteristics of \napplicants that the admissions office should consider in the admissions process. \na.  Gener:ll Objectives. \nThe Admissions Policy adopted by the Law School faculty in 1992 -- whose \nimplementation plaintiff challenges in this case -- establishes the goals that govern the \nadmissions process:  \"to admit a group of students who individually and collectively arc among \nthe most capable students applying to American law schools in a given year.\"  Ex. D at 1.  It \nrecognizes the important role that students play in the education of their classmates.  In \nconducting classes, law professors \"depend on prepared and articulate students to advance the \ndiscussion.\" Id.  At the same time, a great deal of the learning that occurs in law school actually \ntakes place outside the classroom, \"in informal conversations\" and in the Law School's many \njournals, student organizations, and \"diverse political groups of the left, right and in between.\" \n!d. at 2.  The Law School therefore seeks \"a mix of students with varying backgrounds and \nexperiences who will respect and learn from each other,\" and who can assist the Law School in \nachieving its educational mission.  !d. at 1.

Grades, Test Scores, and Their Limitations. \nUnder the 1992 Policy, the goals of the admissions process employed by the Law \nSchool include \"maximizing competence\" and selecting a class of students likely to lead \n\"distinguished legal career[s].\" ld. at 3.  Achieving this goal is an extremely difficult task.  To \nselect the 339 students enrolled in 1997, for example, the Law School had to cull through nearly \n6 \n\n~  -~-------~-- --~·------· ~ --~----~--~~-~----------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 22 of 65    Pg ID 752\n3400 applications.  It was, however, only able to offer admission to 1163 students.  Ex. B at \nUML025657. \nIn attempting to choose from the many students who apply for admission each \nyear, the Law School's admissions office relics on two assumptions: first, that students who \nreceive high grades in law school arc more likely to distinguish themselves as lawyers, and, \nsecond, that there is some statistical correlation between an applicant's undergraduate grades and \nscores on standardized tests (such as the LSAT exam), on the one hand, and the grades that \napplicant will ultimately cam in law school, on the other.  The Policy notes, however, that these \nassumptions arc quite imperfect.  Ex. D at 3.  The Law School believes that the educational \nexperience of the entire Law School community is improved, and that its students arc more likely \nto enjoy successful careers as lawyers, if its admissions decisions result in the composition of a \ndiverse class of students that will create a rich and vibrant learning environment. \nConsequently, the Policy establishes that grades and test scores (which arc \ntranslated into an \"index score\") arc important, but by no means the exclusive, admissions \ncriteria.  While the Policy generally recognizes that \"the higher one's index score, the greater \nshould be one's chances of being admitted,\" it docs not envision or permit admissions decisions \nto be reduced solely to grade point averages and LSAT scores.  /d. at 4.  The Policy recognizes \nthat many applicants to the Law School have very high index scores.  Id .  As a result, \"[w]hcn \nthe differences in index scores arc small, we believe it is important to weigh as best we can not \njust the index, but also such file characteristics as the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality \nof the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty \n7 \n\n--- ----------····-·  . ------ - ---------------· \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 23 of 65    Pg ID 753\nof undergraduate course selection.\" Id . at 5.11  Because each application is considered in its \nentirety, it very often turns out to be the case that applicants with lower grades and test scores \n\"arc accepted while those who seem to have more attractive credentials are denied admission.\" \nId . at 7.  The Policy acknowledges that this pattern of decisionmaking is inevitable whenever \n\"qualities not captured in grades and test scores figure in the evaluation of an application.\".& \nHowever, the Policy maintains that a \"minimal criterion\" that applies to all admissions decisions \nis that no student will be admitted unless the expectation is that the applicant will \"do well \nenough to graduate without serious academic problems.\"  Id . at 2, I 0. \nc.  Treating Each Applicant as an Individual. \nIn addition to addressing the role that quantitative factors should play in the \nadmissions process, the Policy considers the importance of non-quantitative factors in \nadmissions decisions.  It offers two ways in which reliance on factors that are not reflected in the \n\"index\" serves the Law School's larger purpose of assembling the strongest possible law school \nclass.  Id . at 8.  First, the Policy explains that there arc some applicants for whom the admissions \n~1  The Policy also addresses who should exercise the discretion to rely on non-\nquantitative factors in making admissions decisions.  Prior to the time he left the Law School in \n1990, Assistant Dean and Director of Admissions Allan Stillwagon made most admissions \ndecisions, \"with little formal input from the faculty.\"  Ex. D at 7; sec also Stillwagon Dep. at 17-\n18.  But the Policy explains that since Director Stillwagon's departure, \"the Dean of Admissions \nhas consulted with the faculty on a portion of the admissions decisions.  This has allowed the \nfaculty as represented by its admissions committee to tell its Dean of Admissions how a mix of \nfaculty evaluate the different kinds of strengths and weaknesses that arc found in applicant files.\" \nJd. at 7-8. \nOne of the factors that figures into admissions dccisionmaking is state residency. \nThe 1992 Policy notes that the Law School has a special commitment to admit residents of the \nState of Michigan, in light of the \"special claims of Michigan residents to a Michigan Law \nSchool education.\"  Ex. D at 2.  As \"part of a publicly funded university,\" the faculty concluded, \na \"reasonable proportion of our places should go to Michigan residents, even if some have \nqualifications lower than those of some applicants from outside Michigan.\"  Jd.  In fact, the Dean \nof the Law School informed the Director of Admissions each year what proportion of the class \nshould be consist of Michigan residents.  Shields Dcp. at 92-95. \n8 \n\n------------- ----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 24 of 65    Pg ID 754\noffice will have reason to doubt a prediction based solely on index scores:  \"imagine an applicant \nwhose undergraduate course selection seems relentlessly dull, whose personal statements and \n[essays) arc thin or incoherent, and whose letter[ s] of recommendation damn with faint praise.\" \n!d. at 4-5.  Such an applicant might be denied admission despite his or her high grades and test \nscores.  At the same time, there arc other students whom the admissions office believes arc likely \nto excel in the study and practice of law, despite relatively low index scores.  For example, the \nPolicy refers to a student whose college performance exceeded what one might have predicted \nbased on his standardized test scores, and who was applying to law school with a similarly low \nLSAT score.  !d. at 9.  The Law School concluded that this student's performance on \nstandardized tests would likely be a poor predictor of his academic success, and therefore \nadmitted him despite his comparatively low \"index\" score.  Id. \nSecond, the admissions office, by not limiting admissions review to grades and \ntest scores, places the Law School in a position to \"achieve that diversity which has the potential \nto enrich everyone's education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its \nparts.\" ld. at 9-10.  The Policy provides three concrete examples of applicants with compelling \nexperiences and backgrounds for whom the Faculty Admissions Committee recommended \nadmission \"influenced by diversity considerations.\" Id. at 10-11.  After citing these examples, \nthe Policy explains that individual members of the faculty may place different values on different \nachievements and characteristics.  One faculty member might, for example, accord a great deal \nof weight to the fact that an individual was awarded an Olympic gold medal or a Ph.D. in \nphysics, whereas another might place more emphasis on an applicant's experience as a \nVietnamese boat person.

The Role of Racial and Ethnic Diversity. \nAs part of the overall goal of enrolling an intellectually vibrant and diverse class \nof law students, the Policy notes that there is \"a commitment to one particular type of diversity \nthat the school has long had and which should continue.  This is a commitment to racial and \nethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been \nhistorically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, \nwho without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful \nnumbers.\" !d. at 12.  The Policy explains that students from such racial and ethnic minority \ngroups \"arc particularly likely to have experiences and perspectives of special importance to our \nmission,\" and that by \"enrolling a 'critical mass' of minority students, we have ensured their \nability to make unique contributions to the character of the Law School.\" !d. \nThis said, the Policy emphasizes that the faculty do not \"mean to define diversity \nsolely in terms of racial and ethnic status.\" !d.  Rather, the Policy's concern with achieving \nracial and ethnic diversity is an inextricable part of the Law School's broader goal of enrolling \n\"students with distinctive perspectives and experiences,\" in order to improve the educational \nexperience for all of the students enrolled in its classes.  !d. at 9-10.  It is, however, the Law \nSchool's judgment that, among the types of diversity to be valued, having a racially and \nethnically diverse group of students will improve legal education and the quality oflawyering, \nand ultimately improve our society.  As Jeffrey Lehman, the Dean of the Law School, has \nexplained, the Law School's view is that the \"quality of the intellectual experience that our \n10 \n\n----· ·-····-····· ·····------··------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 26 of 65    Pg ID 756\nstudents enjoy\" is improved by bringing together, in the law school classroom, students with a \nbroad array of perspectives, experiences and insights, including those derived from experiences \nrelated to race.  Ex. E at UML024996.  Having a diverse student body furthers the Law School's \ncentral educational mission •• \"to cultivate in our students the ability to understand an issue from \nmany perspectives.\" !d. \nThis view is widely shared in legal education and in the legal profession.  For \nexample, Kent Syverud, who is Dean of Vanderbilt Law School and Editor of the Journal of \nLegal Education, states in the expert report he prepared in this case that \"all law students receive \nan immeasurably better legal education, and become immeasurably better lawyers, in law \nschools and law school classes where the student body is racially heterogeneous.\"  Syverud \nExpert Rep. at 2.  \"[R]acial heterogeneity dramatically enhances the ability of the best active, \nSocratic teaching to achieve its purposes\" of requiring law students to \"sec any set of facts from \ndifferent points of view.\" !d. at 3. \nSimilarly, Judge Robert B. Webster, a former President of the Michigan State Bar \nand former Chief Judge of the Oakland County Circuit Court, adds that racial and ethnic \ndiversity in legal education is essential both to a law school's mission in training effective \nlawyers, and to the perception that our legal system is able to administer equal justice.  Judge \nWebster notes that \"the ability to empathize and work effectively with people of diverse races \nand backgrounds is critical to our profession.  It is an ability that must be developed as \nproficiently, and as soon, as it possibly can.\"  Webster Expert Rep. at 5.  Judge Webster further \nnotes, drawing on a number of studies of the Michigan court system, that \"when diverse classes \nof law school students enter the legal profession it enhances the appearance that our system is \njust, unprejudiced, and equally available to people of all races.\" !d. at 5-7.  Derek Bok, former \nII \n\n- --------·---------1 \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 27 of 65    Pg ID 757\nDean of Harvard Law School and former President of Harvard University, echoed this point in \nhis expert report, stating that the \"bar has made clear that it views the participation of minority \nattorneys as essential to public confidence in the machinery ofj ustice.\" Bok Expert Rep. at 23. \nAdditional expert testimony submitted by the Law School in this case provides \nunrcbutcd empirical proof for the common sense judgment that racial and ethnic diversity \nimproves cducation.n'  Patricia Y. Gurin, a Professor of Psychology at the University of \nMichigan with more than 34 years of experience in her field, has conducted an extensive \nempirical analysis of how diversity in higher education affects students.  Using national and \nMichigan undergraduate student databases, Professor Gurin demonstrates that students learn \nbetter when they arc educated in racially and ethnically diverse environments.  Her analysis \nshows that students who experienced the most racial and ethnic diversity in classroom settings \nand in informal interactions with other students showed the greatest engagement in active \nthinking processes, growth in intellectual engagement and motivation, and improvement in a \nrange of academic and intellectual skills.  See Gurin Expert Rep. at 35-38.  These findings--\nwhich strongly indicate that students educated in diverse environments arc better prepared to \nparticipate in our pluralistic democracy because they arc more equipped to understand different \nfll  Plaintiffs counsel has made the extraordinary --and constitutionally erroneous - \nstatement that \"[a]ny evidence or any report that shows, or purports to show, that racial diversity \nhas educational value is besides the point,\" Peter Schmidt, U. ofM  ichigan Turns to Scholars to \nBolster Its Defense ofA ffirmative Action, Chronicle of Higher Education, April2, 1999 at A38 \n(quoting Terence J. Pell, of the Center for Individual Rights).  See also Jaimic Winkler, Expert \nWitnesses Discuss Diversity, Michigan Daily, March 18, 1999 at 7a (quoting Pell to the same \neffect).  But, as explained earlier, the Law School's common sense educational judgment \nregarding diversity lies at the heart of what Bakke permits and is part of a well-established line of \nSupreme Court precedent recognizing the autonomy that universities, consistent with the First \nAmendment, have to pursue their educational mission.  Defendants' expert case, which confirms \nthe correctness of Bakke and the Law School's educational judgment, therefore, cannot be \nviewed as \"besides the point.\" \n.  12 \n\n··------··- -----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 28 of 65    Pg ID 758\nperspectives, deal with conflict, and appreciate the ways in which differences can be harnessed in \npursuit of a common goal, id. at 18-21 --arc applicable to undergraduate and law school \neducation alike.  See Syverud Expert Rep. at 3-4.1' \nThe reason for the educational benefits that diversity produces is --as the reports \nsubmitted by defendants' other experts in this case make clear -- that race still matters a great \ndeal in American life.  Indeed, in some areas, such as housing and elementary and secondary \neducation, our society is as racially separate today as it was before Brown v. Board ofE  ducation, \n347 U.S. 483 (1954), and the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s.  See Sugrue Expert \nRep. at 7-8, 19-44; see also Foncr Expert Rep. at 48-49; Camarillo Expert Rep. at 23-26. \nAmericans of different races reside in different communities, attend separate elementary and \nsecondary schools, and rarely have sustained, meaningful contact with one another.  Sugrue \nExpert Rep. at 19-44.  This persistent racial separation fosters misconceptions that make it nearly \nimpossible for individuals outside of the higher education context to break racial stereotypes, id. \nat 67, and has an extremely negative impact on student experiences, perspectives, and \nworld views. \nAt a very concrete level then, racial separation provides the backdrop against \nwhich the Law School necessarily makes it admissions decisions.  As they approach their first \nyear of law school, most students will have had few opportunities to benefit from exposure to the \nideas and perspectives of people from backgrounds and racial groups different from their own. \n11 \nThe strong evidence regarding the educational benefits that accrue from having a \nracially and ethnically diverse student body submitted by defendants distinguishes this lawsuit \nfrom cases such as Johnson v. Board ofR egents ofth e Univ. ofG  a., 106 F. Supp. 2d 1362 (S.D. \nGa. 2000), in which a district court, inter alia,  recently invalidated a university admissions plan \non tl1c grounds tl1at there was only \"amorphous\" evidence of diversity's educational benefits. \nLike Hopwood, Johnson disregards Bakke and applicable restraints on judicial authority.  See, \ne.g., Stale Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20 (1997). \n13 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 29 of 65    Pg ID 759\n---, \nSee Gurin Rep. at 4.  Of course, some students will have received their undergraduate training \nfrom racially diverse institutions.  But others will not have enjoyed this benefit.  And, even \namong those who did, very few, if any, will have had the opportunity to discuss, in a diverse \nsetting, the specific issues raised by the law school curriculum.  See id. \nThus, bringing students from different races together in a law school class cannot \nhelp but challenge preconceived notions.  For example, in his expert report, Judge Webster \nindicates that his first experiences with racial diversity gave rise to \"encounters [that] exposed \nand destroyed racial stereotypes I did not even know I harbored .... I found myself exposed to \nnew perspectives, new kinds of life experiences, new ways of looking at the world.\"  We bstcr \nExpert Rep. at 4-5.  It is encounters such as the ones described by Judge Webster-- encounters \nthat ultimately help students to appreciate the similarities they share as well as the differences \nthat separate them -- that create the educational opportunity for more complex and active \nthinking.  See Gurin Expert Rep. at 15.  For a law school such as the University of Michigan, \ncreating a diverse student body in which all students can interact with members of different \ngroups comprises a central part of the institution's overall educational mission.  See Ex. Eat \nUML024996; see also Ex. D.  Without diverse experiences, students arc not likely to develop the \nskills needed to move beyond the misconceptions created by racial separation and to succeed in \nthe modern legal environment of our increasingly pluralistic society. \n2.  The Admissions Process:  Implementing the Admissions Policy. \nThe vast majority of the work involved in carrying out the admissions process at \nthe Law School each year is completed by a relatively small staff of admissions professionals \nwho work closely together in reviewing application files.  The admissions office is directed by \nthe Assistant Dean and Director of Admissions, currently Erica Munzel, see Munzel Dcp. at 7, \n14 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 30 of 65    Pg ID 760\nwho receives assistance in reviewing files from only two or three other file readers, and makes \nmost of the final admissions decisions.&  The extensive record evidence developed in this case \nmakes clear that the professional staff of the Law School's admissions office has done what it \n21 \nhas been directed to do:  carry out the Admissions Policy adopted by the faculty in 1992.\na.  File-By-File Review. \nThe Law School receives a large but fairly manageable number of applications \neach year.  For example, between 1995 and 1997, the number of applications ranged from 3373 \nto 4063.  Ex. Bat UML025657.  Each application comes to the admissions office with an \naccompanying report from the Law School Data Assembly Service, a national clearinghouse that \nsummarizes each law school applicant's grades and test scores, and provides some information \nabout the relative strength of undergraduate institutions.  Metzler Dep. at 78-79.  Because it \nreceives a manageable number of applications accompanied by information compiled and \npresented in a consistent manner, the admissions office -- with its relatively small staff of \nprofessional admissions counselors -- is able to review application files without having to rely on \nRl  Although final decisions arc generally made by the Assistant Dean and Director \nof Admissions, Dennis Shields--who served in that position from July 1991 until January 1998, \nShields Dcp. at 9-1 0, 13 -- sometimes authorized the Associate Director to make final admissions \ndecisions.  Shields Dcp. at 53-56.  An Assistant Director also reviewed applicant files during this \ntime, but did not make final admissions decisions.  Metzler Dcp. at 19; Leonard Dcp. at 32-33. \n21  Plaintiff has deposed almost the entire admissions staff:  Olivia Birdsall (who \nserved as a senior admissions counselor from 1981 to 1993); Susan M. Eklund (who served as \nAssociate Dean, and oversaw the admissions office in 1990-91); Kurt Kaiser (who, for a time, \nhad responsibility for the admissions office computer system); Alissa Leonard (who worked in \nthe admissions office as a receptionist, secretary, and admissions counselor from 1990 to 1996); \nMarcea Metzler (who worked as an admissions counselor from 1996 to 1998); Erica Munzcl \n(who served as an admissions counselor from 1994 to 1998, and who was named Assistant Dean \nand Director of Admissions in 1998); Dennis J. Shields (who was Assistant Dean and Director of \nAdmissions from 1991 to 1998); Allan Stillwagon (who was Assistant Dean and Director of \nAdmissions from 1979 to 1990); Kirsten Vandenburg (who worked as an admissions counselor \nin 1991-92); and Jean Wong (who has served, since 1996, as the admissions office's file clerk \nand office manager). \n15 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 31 of 65    Pg ID 761\n--\na set of formal guidelines (beyond those established in the Policy itself) to direct the admissions \nstaff in the exercise of their discretion.  Shields Dep. at 132.  Indeed, the only document other \nthan the Policy provided to new file readers in the admissions office was a brief memorandum, \nsee Exhibit F, written by Admissions Director Shields.  See Shields Dep. at 59; Metzler Dep. at \n14-19. \nThe memorandum prepared by Director Shields instructs file reviewers to seek \nout \"from an especially well credentialed pool of candidates, those that show the most promise.\" \n' \nEx. F at 4.  Making those determinations \"requires more than a mere review of the numbers \n(LSAT and GPA), credentials.\" I d.  This is not to say that grades and test scores are \nunimportant.  Indeed, the memorandum recognizes, as the Policy does, that, in many cases, \"we \nwill ultimately be swayed ... by the strength of the numbers.\" ld. at 6.  But the Law School \nreceives applications from an extremely talented and accomplished pool of candidates, id. at 4, \nand does not rely heavily on narrow distinctions between candidates on the basis of grades and \ntest scores.  Indeed, an applicant's grades and test scores merely \"pu[t] a context on the file as \nyou read it.\" Jd. at 80.  The \"index score,\" which is calculated using an applicant's \nundergraduate grades and LSAT score, is used  principally as a way to \"sort\" files, such that \nadmissions staff would review a \"batch of files\" in the same index range.  Shields Dep. at 72-73; \nsee also Metzler Dep. at 26-29.  As the Policy provides, \"if the numbers are high there's more of \na chance that a person will be admitted.\"  Ex. F at 81. \nHowever, because \"many of the numbers will be so close to the same,\" the \nadmissions staff is required to dig deeper into the applications, to review the essays and letters of \nrecommendation, \"to look for candidates that show intellectual talent, leadership ability, and \nacademic acumen which augers for a lively intellectual educational community and important \n16 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 32 of 65    Pg ID 762\ncontributions to the profession.\"  Ex. Fat 4.  The Law School's process for making admissions \ndecisions is more of an art than a science.  In order to make a decision on any given applicant, an \nadmissions counselor must \"read a file and look at the essays, look at the transcripts, look at the \nletters of recommendation,\" and decide how the particular applicant would contribute to the Law \nSchool class.  Shields Dcp. at 23. \nb.  Race as a Single Though Important Element. \nIn addition to conducting an individualized, file-by-file review of applications, the \nadmissions staff also implements the 1992 Policy by considering the way in which an applicant \nwould likely contribute to the diversity of the law school class, which includes racial diversity.  It \nis undisputed that race is one of many important factors in the admissions process.  Applicants to \nthe Law School arc not required to disclose their race when applying.  But where they do, \nAdmissions Director Shields observed, that \"would be one of the things amongst all of those \nthings that would be part of what you thought about as you made a judgment about a file.\" \nShields Dcp. at 23. \nIn selecting students for admission to the Law School, the admissions office has \nnot defined a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students necessary to achieve the full \nbenefits of a diverse student body.  Nor have admissions decisions been made to assure that a \nparticular number of underrepresented minority students arc admitted or enrolled.  Shields Dep. \nat I 0 I.  Instead, the Director of Admissions makes individual admissions decisions on an \nindividual, file-by-file basis.  For example, Admissions Director Dennis Shields has said that, \nwhile he was \"concerned about there being a good representation of students of color in the \nclass,\" id., there was \"no precision\" about what a \"critical mass\" or a \"good representation\" \n17 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 33 of 65    Pg ID 763\nwould be.  Id.lii/  Simply put, the Law School docs not employ quotas or enrollment targets as \npart of its admissions process. \nc.  The Data. \nThe data reveal a number of important facts about the admissions process.  First, \nover the years, the pool of underrepresented minority applicants has represented a relatively \nsmall proportion of the total group of applicants to the Law School.  See Ex. B.  Additionally, the \nrate of admission for underrepresented minority students is similar to that for majority students. \nFurther, the number of underrepresented minority students admitted to the Law School has \nvaried considerably from year to year, demonstrating quite clearly that the Law School does not \nrely upon racial quotas or enrollment targets in making admissions decisions.  In 1994, for \nexample, a year in which it received an unusually large number of applications from African \nAmerican students, the Law School offered admission to 138 of the 639 African American \napplicants.  !d. at UML025659.  The following year, however, it offered admission to only 97 \nsuch applicants, a thirty percent drop in the number admitted from the year before. \nLikewise, the Law School's so-called yield rates vary modestly by race from year \nto year.  See, e.g., id.  \"Yield\" refers to the proportion of students who accept an offer of \nadmission and actually choose to enroll.  The intense competition among highly selective \n.lW  Over the course of the admissions cycle, the admissions office monitors the flow \nof applications, admissions decisions, and enrollment deposits.  In doing so, the office pays \nattention, among other things, to the status of the School's minority applicants, as the Policy \nrequires.  In particular, the admissions office relics on a report on the status of the applicant pool \n-- the daily report, Ex. B --to provide descriptive data, which compares the current year's pool of \napplicants to those in preceding years.  The daily report \"allows you to sec what the statuses arc \nin your applicant pool at any point in time.\" Munzcl Dcp. at 159.  It is \"a way of tracking what \nis occurring.\" Shields Dcp. at 141.  Admissions Director Shields made clear--and his testimony \nis not refuted-- that the \"numbers\" reflected in the daily report \"[did not] drive the decisions that \nI make or made.\" !d.  \"[N]o matter what this tells me, I've still got to go read the files and \ndecide whether or not somebody should be admitted.\" !d. at 142. \n18 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 34 of 65    Pg ID 764\ninstitutions like the Law School essentially means that less than a third of the students admitted \nto the University of Michigan Law School each year will ever enroll.  To illustrate, in 1997, the \nyield rate for white students was 29.9 percent.  Jd. at UML025660.  In other words, less than one \nin three white students offered admission to the Law School in 1997 actually enrolled.  For \nAfrican American students, the yield rate for that year was even lower-- with 25.2 or only one in \nfour students offered admission actually enrolling in school.  Jd. at UML025659. \nFinally, the data show that, while there is some difference between the average \ngrades and test scores of admitted majority and admitted minority students, the average grades \nand test scores for all admitted students at the Law School arc quite high.  See Ex. G.  For \nexample, of those applicants in 1998 who were admitted to the Law School, the median LSA T \nand GPA of the Caucasian applicants was 168 (on a scale of 120 to 180) and 3.66, while for \nAfrican American applicants the medians were 159 and 3.4l.W See id.  Given this information \n-- which highlights the fact that the Law School implements its Policy solely to admit applicants \nwho arc likely to succeed at the School and thereafter -- and the other undisputed facts in this \ncase, there is no doubt that the Law School complies with Bakke. \nw \nAs Claude Steele, Chair of the Psychology Department at Stanford University and \nan expert witness for defendants in this matter, observes in his expert report, even much larger \ndifferences than these in standardized test scores would \"represent[] a very small difference in \nskills critical to grade performance.\"  Steele Expert Rep. at 5. \n19 \n\n~--~--~-~  -~~--~---··· -~--~~-·-----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 35 of 65    Pg ID 765\nARGUMENT \nPlaintiff seeks to effect a sea change in the law pertaining to the academic \nfreedom enjoyed by university officials in making decisions-- designed to further the \neducational objectives of their institutions of higher education-- to enroll a diverse class of \nstudents with the skills and experiences needed to succeed in the modem university context.  In \neffect, plaintiff urges this Court to ignore the Supreme Court's holding in Bakke, which expressly \npermits the competitive consideration ofracc in university admissions, and to hold that race may \nnever be employed as a factor in admissions.  But this Court is without the authority to make \nsuch a dramatic break with precedent.  The Supreme Court's decision in Bakke has not been \noverruled or even reconsidered in the more than 20 years since that case was decided, and it is \ncontrolling hcrc .. u1 Moreover, there is nothing in the extensive record developed in this case to \nsuggest that the Law School has failed to adhere to the standards set forth in Bakke in carrying \nLike Bakke, the instant case is about the usc of race as a factor in admissions to \nachieve the educational benefits of having a racially diverse student body.  Thus, cases \nconcerning the usc of race to remedy past discrimination do not bear directly on the question \npresented here: whether achieving the benefits of diversity in higher education is a compelling \ninterest.  Moreover, recent Supreme Court decisions, such as those in the municipal and federal \nconstruction contract context, holding that all racial classifications arc subject to strict scrutiny \nand must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest arc consistent with and do not \nquestion Bakke.  See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, SIS U.S. 200,227 (199S); City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).  Justice Powell's pivotal opinion in \nBakke is wholly consistent with this approach, as he also applied \"the most exacting judicial \nexamination,\" 438 U.S. at 291, and concluded that the usc of race must be \"precisely tailored to \nserve a compelling governmental interest,\" id. at 299.  It is therefore understandable that the \nSupreme Court has not questioned the core holding of Bakke.  See, e.g., Akhil Reed Amar and \nNeal Katyal, Bakke's Fate, 43 UCLA L. Rev. 174S, 1746 (1996) (\"Because our public \nuniversities should be places where persons from different walks of life and diverse backgrounds \ncome together to talk with, to learn from, and to teach each other, each person's unique \nbackground and life experience may be relevant in the admissions process-- thus, absolute color \nblindness is not constitutionally required in the education context.\"); see also Brief of the United \nStates as Amicus Curiae at 3 (explaining that Bakke permits race to be considered as one of \nmany factors in admissions and controls the question presented in this case). \n20 \n\n----\n···----···-----------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 36 of 65    Pg ID 766\nout the 1992 Admissions Policy.  The undisputed facts in the record demonstrate conclusively \nthat, consistent with its articulated objective of achieving the educational benefits that having a \nracially diverse body brings, the Law School employs only what Bakke expressly permits --the \ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnicity as one of many factors in admissions.  As a \nresult, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims. \nI.  CONTROLLING PRECEDENT PERMITS THE COMPETITIVE \nCONSIDERATION OF RACE IN LAW SCHOOL ADMISSIONS. \nFor nearly a century, the Supreme Court has recognized the special role and \nmission of educational institutions in our democracy.  As early as 1907, Justice Holmes referred \nto education as \"one of the first objects of public care.\" Interstate Consol. St. Ry. Co. v. \nMassachusetts, 207 U.S. 79, 87 (1907).  Since that time, the Court has repeatedly acknowledged \nthe government's \"special role as educator,\" Board ofE duc., Island Trees Union Free Sch. Dist. \nNo. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853,921 (1982) (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and observed that this \n\"special role\" carries with it an obligation to participate \"in the preparation of individuals for \nparticipation as citizens, and in the preservation of the values on which our society rests,\" \nAmbach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68,76 (1979).  Indeed, the Court has made it clear that the \n\"Constitution presupposes the existence of an informed citizenry prepared to participate in \ngovernmental affairs.\"  Pico, 457 U.S. at 876 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  For this reason, the \nSupreme Court recognized, in its landmark desegregation decisions, that an education that \nencourages students to \"engage in discussions and exchange views with other students,\" \nMcLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents/or Higher Educ., 339 U.S. 637,641 (1950), is \"the very \nfoundation of good citizenship,\" Brown v. Board ofEduc., 347 U.S. 483,493 (1954). \nThis long history of recognizing not only the importance of education, but also the \nspecial role of educators in preparing students for participation in our society, provides the \n21 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 37 of 65    Pg ID 767\nbackdrop against which the Court rendered its seminal decision in Bakke.  Justice Powell's \nopinion in that case, which held that the goal of attaining the educational benefits of diversity is a \ncompelling state interest that justifies the consideration of race as a factor in university \nadmissions, provides controlling authority for the actions taken by the Law School in \nadministering the 1992 Admissions Policy at issue in this case. \nA.  A Properly Devised Admissions Program Involving the Competitive \nConsideration of Race and Ethnic Origin Is Constitutional. \nThe Supreme Court's decision in Bakke concerned the constitutionality of the \nadmissions policy of the University of California at Davis Medical School.  In contrast to the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School's Admissions Policy, Davis operated a two-track admissions \nsystem, in which fixed numbers of scats were explicitly reserved for majority and minority \napplicants -- 16 seats in a class of I 00 were allocated for minority students, while 84 went to \nmajority students.  438 U.S. at 275.  Allan Bakke, a white applicant twice rejected by Davis, \nchallenged the medical school admissions policy, claiming that it violated his rights under both \nthe Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.  Id. at 277-78.  The California \nSupreme Court invalidated the plan, holding that race can never be considered as a factor in \nadmissions and ordering Allan Bakke admitted to the medical school. \nA sharply divided Supreme Court rendered a judgment reversing the California \nSupreme Court decision.  Four justices would have reversed the entire judgment and upheld the \nentire Davis admissions system, including the reservation of a fixed number of scats for minority \napplicants exclusivcly;111 four others would have affirmed the entire judgment, holding that Title \n11/  Bakke, 438 U.S. at 324-79 (Brennan, J.,joincd by White, Marshall, and \nBlackmun, JJ.) \n22 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 38 of 65    Pg ID 768\nVI of the Civil Rights Act forbids any consideration of race.l!!'  Justice Powell delivered the \njudgment of the Court and authored the pivotal opinion, which invalidated the Davis admissions \nsystem, but held that achieving the academic benefits of a diverse student body is a compelling \ninterest that justifies the competitive consideration of race as a factor in university admissions. \nSee id. at 314-15.  Significantly, Part V.C. of Justice Powell's opinion was joined by four other \nJustices (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.), establishing a majority oftl1e Court for \nthe following critical passage, which states Bakke's central holding and judgment regarding the \nusc of race in university admissions: \nIn enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, \nthe courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that \nlegitimately may be served by a properly devised atlmissio11s program i11vo/ving \nthe competitive consideratio11  of race am/ ethnic origin.  For this reason,  so \nmuch  of  the  California  court's  judgment  as  enjoins  petitioner  from  any \nconsideration of the race of any applicant must be reversed. \n!d. at 320 (emphasis added).  Thus, after Bakke, there can be no doubt that \"a properly devised \nadmissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and etlmic origin\" is \nconstitutional. \nB.  Diversity Is a Compelling Interest in the University Admissions Context. \nJustice Powell's opinion in Bakke articulates a number of important principles. \nThe first of these is that \"the interest of diversity is compelling in the context of a university's \nadmissions program,\" 438 U.S. at 314, because \"our tradition and experience lend support to the \nview that the contribution of diversity is substantial,\" id. at 313.  Justice Powell emphasized that \n\"[t]he atmosphere of'spcculation, experiment and creation'-- so essential to the quality of \nhigher education-- is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body.\" /d. at 312. \nJustice Powell understood that a university is essentially a \"marketplace of ideas\" that functions \nl!!l  Bakke, 438 U.S. at 408-21 (Stevens, J.,joined by Burger, C.J., Rehnquist, and \nStewart, JJ.). \n23 \n\n----------------------------·------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 39 of 65    Pg ID 769\nonly where there is a rich variety of voices available to offer a diversity of perspectives.  This \nvariety cultivates the \"robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth 'out of a multitude of \ntongues.\"' !d. (citations omitted) \nBecause of the salience ofracc in American life, and because the vibrant \nexchange of ideas so essential to university life cannot occur without the presence of individuals \nof different backgrounds and experiences, Justice Powell concluded that racial and ethnic \ndiversity is an essential clement of this mix.ll/ In stating this point, Justice Powell quoted from \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950):  \"The Jaw school, the \nproving ground for Jcgallcaming and practice, cannot be effective in isolation from the \nindividuals and institutions with which the law interacts.  Few students and no one who has \npracticed Jaw would choose to study in an academic vacuum, removed from the interplay of \nideas and the exchange of views with which the Jaw is concerned.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314.  In \nquoting this passage, Justice Powell recognized that the benefits of having a diverse student body \nreflect the values protected by the First Amendment-- the \"robust exchange of ideas which \n1.:[/  Justice Powell's Bakke opinion quoted an article by Dr. William Bowen, then the \nPresident of Princeton University, in which Dr. Bowen explained why providing students with \n\"exposure\" to a diverse group of students was essential to a university's educational mission: \n[A] great deal of! earning occurs informally.  It occurs through interactions among \nstudents of both sexes; of different races, religions, and backgrounds; who come \nfrom cities and rural areas, from various states and countries; who have a wide \nvariety of interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or \nindirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one another to \nreexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about themselves and their \nworld.  As a wise graduate of ours observed in commenting on this aspect of the \neducational process, \"People do not learn very much when tl1cy arc surrounded \nonly by the likes of themselves.\" \nBakke, 438 U.S. at 312-13 n.48. \n24 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 40 of 65    Pg ID 770\ndiscovers truth out of a multitude of tongues,\" id., 438 U.S. at 312 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nThe principle that diversity constitutes a compelling interest that justifies the \ncompetitive consideration of race in university admissions has its roots in a rich heritage of \ncases, dating back more than two decades before the Bakke decision, that recognize that \n\"(a]cademic freedom, though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right, long has been \nviewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. 312.  This line of cases \nestablishes that a university has an important interest in creating a campus environment that \nincludes people from a wide array of backgrounds, perspectives, and beliefs in order to \nencourage a vigorous and healthy learning environment.  Indeed, in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957), the Court emphasized that \"[n]o one should underestimate the vital \nrole in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth.\"  In an often-quoted \npassage from his concurring opinion in Sweezy, Justice Frankfurter expounded still further on the \nimportance of academic freedom to universities: \nIt  is  the  business  of a  university  to  provide  that  atmosphere  which  is  most \nconducive to speculation, experiment and creation.  It is an atmosphere in which \nthere prevail 'the four essential freedoms' of a university-- to determine for itself \non academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, \nand who may be admitted to study. \n!d. at 263 (citation omitted).  Thus, in Keyishian v. Board ofR egents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967), \nthe Court concluded that\"[o  ]ur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, \nwhich is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned.\" \nSignificantly, the Court has specifically applied these principles to the University of Michigan \nitself in Regents oft he University ofM  ichigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214,226 n. 12 (1985), where it \n25 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 41 of 65    Pg ID 771\nheld that \"academic freedom thrives ... on the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas \namong ... students,\" as well as \"autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself.\" \nThe academic freedom discussed in the Court's cases incorporates two important \ncomponents.  First, it acknowledges that the discussion and debate of diverse views, by students \nof diverse backgrounds, is an essential part of the mission of an institution of higher education \nprincipally because it forms the foundation for the \"robust exchange of ideas,\" Bakke, 483 U.S. \nat 312 (quoting Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603), protected by the First Amendment.  In Healy v. \nJames, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81 (1972), for example, the Court noted that \"[t]he college classroom \nwith its surrounding environs is peculiarly the 'marketplace of ideas,' and we break no new \nconstitutional ground in reaffirming this Nation's dedication to safeguarding academic freedom\" \n(citations omitted).  Since Bakke, the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the significance of such \nfree-ranging discussions in a university.  Recently, in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors oft he \nUniv. ofVa., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Court held that the exclusion of a particular viewpoint \nfrom campus debate would not only violate the First Amendment's free speech guarantee, but \nwould also undermine the very purpose of education.  In the university setting, the Court \nexplained, the government \"acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment \nthat is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.\" Id. at 835 (citations omitted). \nIt also noted that encouraging \"free speech and creative inquiry\" improves the educational \nexperience on our nation's campuses, which arc \"vital centers for the Nation's intellectual life.\" \nld. at 836; sec also Board ofR  egents ofUniv. of Wis.  v. Southworth, 120 S. Ct. 1346, 1356 \n(2000) (observing that a university \"may determine that its mission is well served if students \nhave the means to engage in dynamic discussions of philosophical, religious, scientific, social, \nand political subjects in their extracurricular campus life outside the lecture hall\"); Rust v. \n26 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 42 of 65    Pg ID 772\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 200 (1991) (\"[T]he university is a traditional sphere of free expression so \nfundamental to the functioning of our society.\"). \nSecond, the notion of academic freedom recognizes both that educational \ninstitutions should be accorded discretion when making judgments that affect their educational \nmission and that judges should exercise a corresponding amount of restraint when reviewing \nsuch judgments.  The rationale for according universities this sphere of independent academic \ndecision making lies both in the importance of education to our pluralistic democracy and in the \nexpertise educators have in determining how the goals of education can best be achieved.  See, \ne.g., Southworth, 120 S. Ct. at 1355 (\"It is not for the Court to say what is or is not germane to \nthe ideas to be pursued in an institution of higher learning\"); Arkansas Educ. Television Comm 'n \nv. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 674 (1998) (noting that there are a variety of educational decisions, \nsuch as \"a university selecting a commencement speaker, a public institution selecting speakers \nfor a lecture series, or a public school prescribing its curriculum,\" that may not be second-\nguessed in federal court on the grounds that they represent a bias in favor of or against a set of \nideas); Regents oft he Univ. ofM  ich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214,226 (1985) (observing that because \nof the principle of academic freedom, courts arc \"rcluctan[t] to trench on the prerogatives of state \nand local educational institutions\"); Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 263 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) \n(identifying the freedom of a university to \"determine for itself on academic grounds ... who \nmay be admitted to study\"). J.Ji/ \nJ.Ji/ \nThus, under the Court's cases, judicial supervision of primarily educational \ndecisions-- such as decisions concerning the intricacies of a university's admissions processes- \nviolates the principle of deference to educational institutions and intrudes unnecessarily into an \narea where courts Jack expertise.  The decisions of the Sixth Circuit support this conclusion.  See \nJacobson v. Cincinnati Bd. ofEduc., 961 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir. 1992) (observing that \"school \nauthorities have broad discretion to implement educational policy\"); Parate v. lsibor, 868 F.2d \n821, 826 (6th Cir. 1989) (noting that \"[a]cademic freedom thrives not only on the robust and \n27 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 43 of 65    Pg ID 773\n-, \nJustice Powell was therefore on firm ground when he said in Bakke that \n\"universities must be accorded the right to select those students who will contribute the most to \nthe 'robust exchange of ideas'\" and emphasized that, by attempting to foster diversity among its \nstudent body, a university seeks \"to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the \nfulfillment of its mission.\" 438 U.S. at 313.  In light of the profound role that race has played in \nour history and continues to play in American life today, Justice Powell was also on firm ground \nin determining that a university may properly conclude that it is better able to reflect a rich \nvariety of experiences, backgrounds, and insights, if it is permitted to include racial and ethnic \ndiversity among the types of diversity it values and seeks to achieve.  Defendants have marshaled \nabundant evidence that demonstrates that Justice Powell was right about the connection between \neducational excellence and a racially and ethnically diverse student body --and that the hundreds \nof institutions of higher learning that have relied on. his opinion in crafting their admissions \npolicies to achieve such diversity are right as well.  As we have discussed, see supra at 10-14, \nracial and ethnic diversity on campus enhances the academic skills and civic preparedness of all \nuninhibited exchange of ideas between the individual professor and his students, but also on the \n'autonomous decisionmaking [of] ... the academy itself.\"') (citation omitted).  Similarly, the \nconstitution of the State of Michigan recognizes the need for autonomous decision making in the \nuniversity setting.  It expressly vests the authority to govern the University of Michigan in the \nBoard of Regents of the University of Michigan and insulates that body from the control of the \nstate's political branches of government.  See Mich. Const., art. 8 (1963); cf Federated \nPublications, Inc. v. Board of Trustees ofM  ichigan State Univ., 594 N. W.2d 491, 495-96 (Mich. \n1999) (noting that the \"Michigan Constitution confers a unique constitutional status on our \npublic universities and their governing boards\").  Significantly, Congress and the Supreme Court \nhave also recognized the importance of allowing state and local educational institutions to make \njudgments regarding tl1e manner and conditions in which their students will be educated without \ninterference from federal agencies and officials.  See 20 U.S.C. §  1232a (\"No provision ... shall \nbe construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to \nexercise any direction ... over tl1e curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or \npersonnel of any educational institution ....\" );see also Wheeler v. Barrera, 417 U.S. 402 \n(1974) (recognizing statutorily imposed limits on federal involvement in administration of state \neducation programs); Crawfordv. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028 (5th Cir. 1983) (same). \n28 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 44 of 65    Pg ID 774\nstudents -- minorities and non-minorities alike.  Contrary to what plaintiff argues in this case, \nvaluing such diversity is not to assert that one's race determines or preordains the views that any \nparticular person will hold regarding any given subject.  Indeed, there may be no better way to \ndebunk stereotypes than by exposing students-- in a racially diverse educational setting --to the \nwide array of viewpoints that arc very often held by members of a single racial or ethnic group, \nor to confront students with the fact that members of other racial groups have similar views to \ntheir own when differences arc expected. \nC.  Bakke's Limitations on the Consideration of Race in University Admissions. \nAlthough he held that p_ublic universities generally have a compelling interest in \nachieving the benefits of a diverse student body, Justice Powell concluded that the Davis policy \nat issue in Bakke was not precisely tailored to achieve that objective.  Bakke permits colleges and \nuniversities to consider race as a factor in admissions, but imposes certain limitations on the \nmanner in which race may be employed. \nFirst, Justice Powell's opinion makes clear that the \"fatal flaw\" in the Davis \nadmissions system was not the consideration of race, but rather the fact that minorities were \nrigidly insulated from competition with other applicants.  438 U.S. at 319-20.  The Davis \nprogram was deemed to violate the Constitution because it shielded minority applicants from \nnon-minority applicants.  Bakke provides that, in an admissions system \"in which a specified \npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,\" \nid. at 315 (emphasis added), minority applicants arc impermissibly insulated \"from comparison \nwith all other candidates,\" id. at 317.J1J  Racial quotas arc thus incompatible with the \nJ1J \nIn City ofR ichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 496 (1989), Justice \nO'Connor underscored this reading of Bakke.  She described the flaw identified by a majority of \n29 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 45 of 65    Pg ID 775\n\"competitive consideration\" of race as a factor in admissions upheld as constitutional in Bakke \nbecause they create a \"two-track,\" separate admissions system in which minority applicants arc \ncompared only with one another and non-minority applicants arc compared only with one \nanother. \nAdditionally, as Justice Powell described, racial quotas arc an inexact means of \nachieving the kind of diversity that constitutes a compelling interest.  Reliance on rigid quotas \n\"misconceives the nature of the state interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic \nbackground.\" !d. at 315.  Admissions systems that rely on racial quotas do not regard applicants \nof any race as individuals.  Instead, they treat them solely as representatives of groups, \nimproperly reflecting an interest in \"simple ethnic diversity,\" without regard to the variety of \nother factors that contribute both to diversity and to educational excellence.  !d.  In sum, using \nracial quotas ignores the fact that the \"diversity that furthers a compelling state interest \nencompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic \norigin is but a single though important clement.\" !d. \nBakke's prohibition on rigid quotas, or a system that operates as a \"functional \nequivalent\" of a racial quota, id. at 318, docs not invalidate a policy that takes race into account \nin a systematic way in order to realize the benefits of a diverse student body.  As Justice Powell \nexplained, the fact that a university includes race as one of many factors to be considered under \nan admissions policy or concerns itself with the number of minority students to whom it offers \nadmissions docs not render its program unconstitutional.  Sec id.  Indeed, Justice Powell's \nexplicit approval of the Harvard admissions plan, which expressly treated race and ctlmic \nthe Court in tl1c Davis plan as the \"complete[] climinat[ion] [of] minorities from consideration \nfor a specified percentage of opportunities.\" !d. at 496. \n30 \n\n---------·-----\n------------------ --\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 46 of 65    Pg ID 776\nbackground as a \"plus\" factor, plainly forecloses such an argument.  Discussing the Harvard \npolicy, Justice Powell wrote: \nThis kind  of program treats each applicant as an individual in the admissions \nprocess.  The  applicant  who  loses  out  on  the  last  available  seat  to  another \ncandidate receiving a 'plus' on the basis of ethnic background will not have been \nforeclosed from all consideration for that scat simply because he was not the right \ncolor  or  had  the  wrong  surname.  It would  mean  only  that  his  combined \nqualifications, which may have  included  similar nonobjective  factors,  did  not \noutweigh  those  of the  other  applicant.  His  qualifications  would  have  been \nweighed fairly and  competitively, and he would have no  basis to complain of \nunequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nBakke, 438 U.S. at 318. \nMoreover, the fact that race is a decisive factor in certain applications cannot, \nwithout more, render an admissions plan unconstitutional under Bakke.  The consideration of \nrace in admissions is not an end in itself.  Rather, a racially diverse student body is the \"end\" that \nconstitutes a compelling state interest.  Therefore, the consideration of race and ethnicity in the \nadmissions process is constitutional precisely because of-- not in spite of-- the fact that it is \ndesigned to enroll more minority students and produce a diverse student body, which is essential \nto a university's mission.  If this factor made no difference whatsoever in selecting a student \nbody, no university would bother to include it as a \"phantom\" factor in the admissions process. \nBakke, then, must be read to mean what it says.  Fixed quotas that insulate minorities from \ncompetition with non-minority applicants arc forbidden, but systematic efforts to achieve a \nracially and ethnically diverse student body-- which requires each applicant to compete with the \nother applicants in the pool --arc permissible. \nSecond, in addition to limiting the manner in which race can be considered in a \nuniversity admissions process, Bakke also limits the use of race as a factor in admissions to the \n·extent that it eradicates threshold qualifications.  Justice Powell's Bakke opinion makes clear that \na \"properly devised\" admissions system is one that considers race as a factor in choosing among \n31 \n\n~~·· ~~~~~~~-\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 47 of 65    Pg ID 777\n\"otherwise qualified\" applicants.  438 U.S. at 320 .. I.l!'  Accordingly, race cannot be weighed so \nheavily in the admissions process that it warrants the admission of applicants who arc not \ndeemed capable of succeeding at the university.  This said, Bakke clearly docs not require that all \nfactors be weighed equally.  \"[T]he weight attributed to a particular quality or attribute may vary \nfrom year to year depending upon the 'mix' both of the student body and the applicants for the \nincoming class.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317-18 (emphasis added).  So long as an admissions \nprogram is \"flexible enough to consider all pertinent clements of diversity in light of the \nparticular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for \nconsideration\" it will pass constitutional muster, id. at 317.  Under principles of academic \nfreedom, courts must respect the academic judgments made by university officials who decide \nwhat the proper balance of factors, including race, should be in the admissions process, where \nthey adhere to Bakke's requirements regarding the manner and extent to which race can be \nconsidered as a factor in the admissions process. \nD.  Bakke Is Binding Precedent. \nAs previously noted, four other Justices joined Part V.C. of Justice Powell's \nopinion expressly holding that a \"properly devised admissions program involving the \ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnic origin\" is constitutional.  438 U.S. at 320.  Thus, \nthere can be no question that this holding by a majority of the Court constitutes binding \nSimilarly, in United Stales v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987), the Court upheld a \nracial set-aside that had been designed to remedy a showing of discrimination, but also set out a \nlimitation on the extent to which race may be used:  \"the basic limitation, that black troopers \npromoted must be qualified, remains.  Qualified white candidates simply have to compete with \nqualified black candidates.\" Jd at 183. \n32 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 48 of 65    Pg ID 778\nprcccdcnt..l2i  In the years since Bakke, the Court has never overruled or even reconsidered its \nholding in that case.  Indeed, the Court has recognized Bakke's essential holding on a number of \noccasions.  In her concurring opinion in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. ofE  duc., 476 U.S. 267 (1986), \nfor example, Justice O'Connor noted that \"although its precise contours arc uncertain, a state \ninterest in the promotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in \nthe context of higher education, to support the usc of racial considerations in furthering that \ninterest.\" !d. at 286 (citing Bakke). \nSimilarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), a case \ninvolving an alleged violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, also recognized \nBakke's primary holding.  In that case, the Court noted that a promotion plan that considered the \ngender of an employee as one of a range of factors was similar to the Harvard plan \"approvingly \nnoted by Justice Powell\" in Bakke.  Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638.  Upholding the promotion plan, \nthe Court observed that, despite its consideration of gender, the plan \"requires women to \n121 \nAs t11c \"narrowest grounds\" offered in support of the result, Justice Powell's \nopinion also represents the holding of the Court under the Supreme Court's decision in Marks v. \nUnited States. 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).  See also  Ex. H (Smith v.  University of Wash. Law \nSch., No. C97-335Z (W.D. Wash. Feb. 12, 1999)) (holding Justice Powell's opinion controlling \nunder a Marks analysis).  The Sixth Circuit has adopted an interpretation of Marks tlmt supports \nthe conclusion that Bakke provides controlling authority on the usc ofracc in university \nadmissions.  See Triplett Grille, Inc. v. City ofA kron, 40 F.3d 129, 132 (6th Cir, 1994) (\"In light \nof the Supreme Court's instruction tl1at '[w]hcn a fragmented Court decides a case and no single \nrationale explaining tl1c result enjoys the assent offivc Justices, 'the holding of the Court may be \nviewed as tl1at position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on tl1c \n'narrowest grounds.\"\") (citations omitted)  In Bakke, Justice Powell's diversity rationale- \nannounced in Part V.C. of the Court's opinion and joined by four ot11cr Justices to reverse the \npart of the California Supreme Court's decision prohibiting any consideration ofracc in \nadmissions-- stands not only as the holding of the Court, but also as the \"narrowest grounds\" in \nsupport of the judgment.  The opinion authored by Justice Brennan was much broader in \napproach than J usticc Powell's.  J usticc Brennan's opinion would not have applied strict \nscrutiny, as Justice Powell's decision did, to \"benign\" racial classifications and would have \nupheld not only a Harvard-style admissions plan, but also the two-tiered Davis plan at issue. \n33 \n\n---------------·-----·------------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 49 of 65    Pg ID 779\ncompete with all other qualified applicants.  No persons arc automatically excluded from \nconsideration; all are able to have their qualifications weighed against those of other applicants.\" \n!d.  Thus, endorsing Bakke's precedential value and its reasoning, a five-member majority \nconcluded that the consideration of gender was lawful. \nSignificantly, the opinions of the Sixth Circuit have consistently relied on the \nBakke opinion as controlling authority.  In Oliver v. Kalamazoo Bd. ofE  duc., 706 F.2d 757 (6th \nCir. 1983), for example, the court cited Bakke for the proposition that \"affirmative action \nadmission programs of educational institutions may take race into account, but racial quotas arc \nprohibited.\" !d. at 763.  Referring to Bakke, tl1e Sixth Circuit invalidated a court-imposed racial \nquota for minority teachers and expressly stated that a \"wiser approach is a more flexible \naffirmative action program rather than a hiring quota.\" !d.  More recently, in Jacobson v. \nCincinnati Bd. ofE  duc., 961 F.2d 100, 103 (6th Cir. 1992), it relied on Bakke in upholding \nCincinnati's policy of transferring teachers to balance tl1e racial composition of its schools \"to \nachieve a racially integrated faculty throughout the Cincinnati public school system.\"W \nZQt  Other appellate courts have also agreed that Bakke is controlling precedent.  See, \ne.g., Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Sch., 197 F.3d 123, 131 (4th Cir. 1999) (concluding \nthat Bakke permits considering race in admissions and assuming that diversity is a compelling \ninterest, but invalidating a magnet school transfer system as not narrowly tailored to achieve that \nobjective); Tuttle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698,705 (4th Cir. 1999) (same as to a \nschool admissions system); Wessman v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (I st Cir. 1998) (assuming Bakke is \ncontrolling Supreme Court authority, but invalidating race-conscious admissions program \nbecause the school would have achieved meaningful racial and ethnic diversity even without \nconsideration of race as a factor in admissions); Winkes v. Brown Univ., 747 F.2d 792,799 (1st \nCir. 1984) (\"In Bakke, the Court held that some consideration of race in a medical school's \nadmissions criteria was permissible, but that the usc of a rigid quota was not.\"); see also Smith v. \nUniversity of Wash. Law Sch., 2 F. Supp.2d 1324, 1334 (W.D. Wash. 1998) (\"The attainment of \na diverse student body ... is a compelling interest and constitutionally permissible goal for a \nuniversity or graduate program.  Thus, an institution of higher education may take race into \naccount in achieving 'educational diversity.\"') (citing Bakke); Davis v. Halpern, 768 F. Supp. \n968, 975 (E.D.N. Y. 1991) (\"While the court [in Bakke J explicitly rejected the usc of strict \nnumerical quotas to achieve diversity, it endorsed the plans of many colleges and universities \n34 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 50 of 65    Pg ID 780\nThe Fifth Circuit is the only appellate court that has failed to adhere to Bakke.  In \nHopwood v. State ofTexas, 78 F.3d 932, 944 (5th Cir. 1996), that court rejected Bakke's \ndiversity rationale as inconsistent with more \"recent Supreme Court precedent.\"  Its decision in \nthat case, however, was wrong and beyond its power.  While the Supreme Court has-- since \nBakke -- made clear that all racial classifications, even those that benefit racial minority groups, \narc subject to strict scrutiny, see, e.g.,Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), \nit has never rejected Bakke's holding that there is a compelling interest in achieving a racially \ndiverse student body, and that the competitive consideration of race in admissions is narrowly \ntailored to achieve that interest. \nThus, in rejecting Bakke's conclusion that an institution of higher education has a \ncompelling interest in enrolling a racially diverse student body, the Fifth Circuit completely \ndisregarded the constraints on its authority.  Under existing case law, it is clear that the Hopwood \ncourt lacked the authority to override or disregard the Supreme Court's decision in Bakke.  See, \ne.g., Hahn v.  United States, 524 U.S. 236,252-53 (1998) (\"Our decisions remain binding \nprecedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised \ndoubts about their continuing vitality.\"); State Oil Company v.

Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477 (1989) (same).  As a result, its decision \nin Hopwood cannot provide a basis for effecting the drastic change in the law urged by the \nplaintiff in this case. \nII.  THE LAW SCHOOL COMPLIES WITH THE BAKKE STANDARD. \nThe record evidence compiled after extensive discovery in this case permits only \none conclusion--that the Law School's admissions process is a properly devised system within \nthe meaning of Bakke.  The testimony of the Law School admissions personnel is unrefuted: \nthat, as in the Harvard system approvingly discussed by Justice Powell in Bakke, race is \nconsidered as one of a number of important factors in admissions decisions, and that the \nadmissions office carefully examines each application and makes an individual judgment, based \non the entire file, about how the applicant would contribute to the law school class.  After \nextensive discovery, the facts show that: \n•  The Law School has no two-track admissions system.  Shields Dep. at 10 4; \nMunzel Dcp. at 125-26; Eklund Dep. at 49. \n•  The Law School does not utilize racial quotas -- either in form, or in effect. \nShields Dep. at 104; Munzel Dep. at 125-26; Eklund Dep. at 49. \n•  The admissions office does not physically separate applications by race.  Wong \nDep. at 29. \n•  It does not assign minority applications to underrepresented minority student \nreviewers or particular readers within the admissions office.  Munze1 Dep. at 60. \n•  It applies the same academic standards to all ofits students.  Lempert Dep. at 174. \n•  The Law School considers race as a single, though important factor in admissions. \nShields Dep. at 23. \nIn short, no genuine issues offact exist with respect to what the 1992 Policy says and the actions \ntaken by the admissions office in carrying out that policy.  The Law School has clearly complied \nwith Bakke in administering its Admissions Policy. \n36 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 52 of 65    Pg ID 782\n-··~' \nThe Law School's compliance with governing legal standards is not surprising \ngiven the fact that all of the record evidence demonstrates that a major purpose of the 1992 \nAdmissions Policy was to ensure that the Law School complied with the standards set forth in \nthe Bakke decision.  When Lee Bollinger became Dean of the Law School in 1987, Allan \nStillwagon was Assistant Dean and Director of Admissions, a position he had held since 1979. \nStillwagon Dcp. at 8-9.  During Stillwagon's tenure as Director of Admissions, the Law School \nemployed a number of strategies designed to address the \"racial imbalance now existing in the \nlegal profession\" and to make \"the [Law] School a livelier place to learn.\" Ex. I at 85.  One such \nstrategy, referred to as a \"special admissions\" policy, had as its explicit goal the enrollment of a \nfirst-year class that consisted of between 10 and 12 percent minority students.  Another strategy, \nemployed by the admissions office from 1979 to 1990, consisted of a \"pool\" system under which \napproximately half of the students admitted to the entering class were admitted primarily \"on the \nnumbers,\" while the other half of the class was chosen from a group of applicants with slightly \nlower grades and test scores, on the basis of non-quantifiable factors such as extracurricular or \ncharitable activities, or \"remarkable or interesting ethnic or national backgrounds.\"  Stillwagon \nDcp. at 22-23.  Where this \"pool system\" did not yield a class with a sufficient number of \nminority students-- and during Stillwagon's tenure it typically would not, Stillwagon Dep. at 30-\n31, 39-43 --the admissions officer would, employing the \"special admissions\" policy, admit a \nsufficient number of minority students to maintain the Law School's goal at that time of \nachieving an entering class composed of 10 to 12 percent minority students.  Sec Stillwagon \nDcp. at 22-24, 37-39.w \n;w  For students admitted under the \"special admissions\" program, \"qualifications \npredicting success beyond the LSAT and GPA [were] somewhat more emphasized in the \nselection process in order to yield [greater] numbers of members oftl1cse groups in the entering \n37 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 53 of 65    Pg ID 783\nHowever, the \"pool system\" and the \"special admissions\" policy, like practices \nsuch as using underrepresented minority students to review the files of underrepresented \nminority applicants, were eliminated by the Admissions Policy adopted by the Faculty \nAdmissions Committee in 1992,w which, as explained previously, was formed by then-Dean \nBollingcr.:U'  In adopting the 1992 Policy, the Committee chose not to rely on the \"special \nadmissions\" program and \"pool\" system utilized by the previous admissions program.  Instead, it \nadopted an approach to diversity that did not include numerical goals or targets for any group \nother than Michigan residents, Bollinger Dcp. at 107-08; Lempert Dep. at 70, and that valued \nclass.\"  Ex. J at 2.  In addition, \"[m]cmbcrs of minority student organizations read files and \n[made] recommendations to the admissions staff, who [made] the final admissions decisions.\" \nEx. Kat 38. \nDuring the faculty committee's deliberation, Professor Don Regan circulated a \nmemorandum suggesting that the Policy include a \"target range\" of minority students.  See Ex. \nL.  The full committee, however, ultimately determined not to include such a \"target range.\" \nRegan Dcp. at 59-60.  Professor Don Herzog, who opposed the inclusion of a \"target range\" in \nthe Policy, explained that he did not believe that a judgment to value diversity lent itself to \n\"quantitative glosses.\"  Herzog Dcp. at 137.  He stated: \n[R]cfcr to the example oflcttcrs of recommendation, some students arc admitted \nto the University of Michigan Law School on their strength-- who otherwise \nwould not get in but for the letters of recommendation, but it would be crazy to \nthink that we say six percent or six to ten percent or eight to 20 percent of our \nstudents arc admitted on the basis of! etters of recommendation. \nWc  could still have a meaningful discussion about whether the admissions office \nis paying too little or too much attention to them, but any attempt in that context, \nto specify a range of numbers, would seem to me on its face absurd, and I have \nvery much the same view about the usc of race and cthnicity. \nHerzog Dcp. at 137-38. \n:UI \nAs Admissions Director Dennis Shields explained during his deposition in this case, \nPresident Bollinger expressed \"general concerns about ... not really understanding special \nadmissions and not really approving of the way it was articulated\" fairly early in his tenure as \nDean of the Law School.

The reason for this is clear:  the 1992 policy plainly complies with Bakke.  Plaintiff \nhas therefore spent the vast majority of her time conducting discovery of old policies irrelevant \nto this litigation, deposing former administrators not involved in the implementation of the \ncurrent policy, and scrutinizing statements made by Law School officials to the ABA in a \ndesperate attempt to manufacture a violation for which she might be able to extract damages \nfrom the Law SchooJ.ll' Her efforts have, however, been in vain.  At the end of the day, there is \nlll  At the same time that the admissions committee was drafting the Admissions \nPolicy, the Law School was required to describe its admissions policies to the American Bar \nAssociation and the Association of American Law Schools as part of their process of accrediting \nthe Law School, a process that takes place once every seven years.  Thus, in a \"self study\" and \nother documents submitted to the ABA/MLS committee in January of 1992, the Law School \ndescribed its \"special admissions policy,\" which was still in effect at that time.  This committee \nthen visited the Law School in February 1992, and met with various Law School officials.  In the \ncommittee's report relating to the Law School's admissions process-- which the Law School \nreceived in July 1992, three months after the new Policy had been adopted by the faculty-- the \nABA committee described the \"special admission\" program.  Referring to the review of \nadmissions policies, which had been in progress at the time of the ABA committee visit, the \nABA committee stated that the \"new Assistant Dean for Admissions ... is conducting a study of \nthe school's special admission program ... but that the basic thrust of the special admissions \nprogram will be maintained.\" Ex. Kat 38.  Plaintiff has seized on that language. \nAfter receiving this report from the ABA, Professor Edward Cooper, then the \nAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs, responded to the ABA committee by noting that \"[s]cvcral \nchanges have been made in our statement of admissions policy since the time of the team visit,\" \nincluding a \"general change\" to the \"diversity component of our statement of admissions policy.\" \nCooper's letter the(! quotes the sections of the Admissions Policy that describe the Law School's \ninterest in enrolling a student body that is diverse in many ways, including with respect to race \nand cthnicity, making no reference to the former special admissions program.  See Ex. M at \nAALS 008-009. \n39 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 55 of 65    Pg ID 785\nno genuine issue offact as to what the 1992 Policy says; there is no genuine issue offact on \nwhether the admissions office has followed that Policy; and there is no question that the 1992 \nPolicy and its application comply with Bakke. \nBecause there is no question that the manner of the Law School's consideration of \nrace in admissions decisions complies fully with the requirements set forth in Bakke, the plaintiff \nis reduced to a focus on a very different question -- whether race can somehow be characterized \nas a \"predominant factor in the admissions process.\"  She alleges that \"[d]cfcndants did not \nmerely usc race as a 'plus' factor\" but \"[r]athcr, race was one of the predominant factors (along \nwith scores on the Law School Admissions Test and undergraduate grade point averages) used \nfor determining admission.\"  Compl. ~ 23.  But Bakke docs not envision that courts arc to decide \nwhether one factor in the admissions process \"predominates\" over another.  Rather, in addressing \nthe manner in which race may be employed, the question Bakke ultimately asks is whether the \nschool at issue seeks only to admit qualified applicants.  And on this point, the record in this case \nis more than clear-- the admissions office docs not admit any student whom it docs not believe \nto be qualified to succeed at the Law School. \nMoreover, nothing in the record developed in this case supports a conclusion that \nrace \"predominates\" over other factors in the admissions process.  Because race is an \"important \nclement\" in the admissions process, see, e.g., Answer~ 19, it is, of course, true that the potential \nability to contribute to the racial diversity of the Law School will sometimes make a difference \nfor some applicants--just as for other applicants it will be in-state residency, grades, test scores, \na powerful essay, or some unique experience or talent that will lead to a favorable admissions \ndecision.  To say this, however, is to say nothing more than that race is one of many factors in \nthe admissions process, a fact defendants fully concede and a policy that Bakke plainly permits. \n40 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 56 of 65    Pg ID 786\nNevertheless, in a rather curious effort to prove this undisputed point, plaintiffs \nexpert Professor Larntz has created a series of charts using database information produced in this \nlitigation.  See Ex. N.  These charts divide the pool of applicants to the Law School into 120 \ncells, with each cell on the chart representing a narrow range of undergraduate grade point \naverages and standardized test scores.  A separate chart is generated for each of the demographic \ngroups for which data is available, in each of the four separate academic years at issue in this \nlitigation-- 1995 through 1998.w These charts demonstrate that, if all you know about an \napplicant is his or her I) undergraduate grade point average; 2) LSAT scores; and 3) race, it turns \nout that being a member of an underrepresented minority increases the chances of a small \nnumber of applicants being admitted.  Based on only some of the data contained in these charts, \nsee Larntz Dep. at 119-20, Larntz drew the conclusion that \"membership in certain ethnic groups \nis an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance.\"  Ex. Nat 9. \nHowever, the notion that race is an important factor in the admissions process \ndocs not mean that it is the predominant factor, as plaintiff asserts.  See Complaint ~ 23.  Indeed, \nplaintiffs own expert conceded this point after analyzing the same data:  \"[f)or the applicants as \na whole ... I think grade point average and LSAT arc more important than any other factors\" in \nthe admissions process.  Larntz Dep. at 90.  Clearly, a factor cannot \"predominate\" if at least two \nother factors arc more important considerations in the process.  The manner or extent to which \nrace is considered in the admissions process cannot fairly be measured by examining plaintiffs \ncharts, or by merely comparing the grades and test scores of majority and minority students. \nSuch an artificial, two-dimensional comparison necessarily excludes many other factors that bear \non admissions decisions. \nAt one point, the Law School also regularly generated such charts.  See, e.g., Ex. \n0. However, it has not done so since 1995.  See Metzler Dcp. at I 04-07. \n41 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 57 of 65    Pg ID 787\n'  -~I \n·) \nDefendants' expert, Professor Stephen Raudenbush, a nationally recognized \nProfessor of Education at the University of Michigan, agrees, stating that \"one cannot reasonably \nconclude that [race] predominates over other factors in the admissions process.\"  Raudenbush \nSupp. Expert Rep. at 5.  Moreover, as Professor Raudenbush noted, any analysis of the extent to \nwhich the Law School considers race as a factor in admissions is put in perspective by the fact \nthat the overall proportion of minority students admitted each year is similar to the admissions \nrates for majority students.  Raudenbush Expert Rep. at 6; Raudenbush Supp. Expert Rep. at 2. \nIn 1997, for example, the Law School offered admission to 3 8.1 percent of the Caucasian \napplicants, but admitted only 31.1 percent of the African American applicants for that year.  See \nEx. B at UML025659-25660.  These basic descriptive statistics belie the notion that race is a \n\"predominant\"· factor in the admissions process. \nFurther, as Professor Raudenbush also pointed out, in order to draw a responsible \nglobal conclusion relating to the usc of race in admissions, one would have to compare the \nresults from the current admissions system with those from a hypothetical system in which race \nwas not considered as a factor.  See Raudenbush Dep. at 41-44.  Professor Larntz has not \nconducted such an analysis.  Professor Raudenbush observed that the underrepresented minority \napplicant pool represents a relatively small proportion of the total group of applicants to the Law \nSchool.  Accordingly, if the Law School were to abandon its policy of considering race as a \nfactor in admissions, the likelihood that any given minority applicant would be admitted would \ndecline dramatically, while at the same time the likelihood that any given majority applicant \nwould be admitted would increase only slightly.  Raudenbush Supp. Expert Rep. at 6-11. \nFinally, as previously indicated, in examining the extent of the Law School's \nconsideration of race as an admissions factor, one must also acknowledge tlmt the University of \n42 \n\n-----------------------\n-·--------·-· \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 58 of 65    Pg ID 788\nMichigan Law School competes for top students -- both majority and minority -- with its peer \ninstitutions.  This competition is reflected in the fact that the yield rate-- i.e., the percentage of \nadmitted students who accept the Law School's offer to enroll-- is somewhat lower for minority \nstudents than for majority students.  That lower yield rate presumably reflects the fact that, even \ngiven the somewhat lower grades and test scores earned by some of the minority applicants to \nwhom the Law School offers admission, many of those students are declining the University of \nMichigan's offer of admission, electing instead to attend another highly-regarded law school. \nEx. Bat UML025659; see Raudenbush Expert Rep. at 6 (emphasizing that yield rates must be \nconsidered in any effort to compose a diverse student body). \nIn sum, plaintiffs efforts to generate a factual dispute that might block \ndefendants' claims for summary judgment in this case have been a resounding failure.  The facts \nin this case are clear and undisputed.  The record plainly demonstrates that the Law School has \nfully and conscientiously complied with Bakke in implementing its Admissions Policy.  This \nCourt should therefore grant defendants' claims for summary judgment. \nIII.  THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS ALSO \nENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFF'S DAMAGES \nCLAIMS UNDER TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. \nIn addition to seeking to enjoin the implementation of the Law School's \nAdmissions Policy, plaintiff has, as noted previously, brought damage claims against the \nindividual defendants -- whose defense of qualified immunity was addressed in an earlier filing \nwith this Court-- and the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan.  Like her claims for \ndeclaratory relief and her efforts to obtain damages from the individual defendants in their \npersonal capacity, however, plaintiffs claims against the Board of Regents, which have been \nbrought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, see Complaint~ 33, must fail.  As an arm of the \n43 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 59 of 65    Pg ID 789\nstate of Michigan, the Board of Regents generally enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity from \nsuit for damages in federal court.  See Regents of the Univ. ofM  ich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 217 \nn.3 (1985); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996); Estate of Ritter v. University \nofM  ich., 851 F.2d 846, 847 n.4 (6th Cir. 1988).  The Board cannot be understood to have waived \nits immunity and, therefore, cannot be held liable for damages in this case. \nUnder existing precedent, a state generally has immunity from suits brought under \nTitle VI.  A state, however, may effect a waiver of that immunity as a condition on its receipt of \nfederal funds.  Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. I, 17 (1981); see also \nHorner v. Kentuc!..y High Sch. Athletic Ass 'n, 206 F.3d 685, 692 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, No. 99-\n2023, 2000 WL 795898 (U.S. Oct. 2, 2000).  The Supreme Court has made clear that Title VI, \nlike Title IX, provides a damages action against entities that receive federal funds.  See Franklin \nv. Gwinner County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992).  \"The two statutes [Title VI and Title IX] \noperate in the same manner, conditioning an offer of federal funding on a promise by the \nrecipient not to discriminate, in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government \nand the recipient of funds.\"  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 286 (1998). \nIn short, Title VI, like statutes such as Title IX, expressly abrogates the Board of Regents' \nsovereign immunity.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7.  Thus, through its acceptance of federal funds, \nthe University of Michigan has effectively entered into an agreement that permits it to be sued, \nunder certain circumstances, for damages in federal court.  The question here, of course, is how \nbroadly should that agreement be read-- what, in effect, is its scope. \nTitle VI's \"contractual nature has [certain] implications for [any] construction of \nthe scope of available remedies.\"  Lago Vista, 524 U.S. at 287.  Accordingly, a court must \n\"examine closely the propriety of private actions holding the recipient liable in monetary \n44 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 60 of 65    Pg ID 790\nI \ndamages for noncompliance with the condition.\" !d.  Specifically, where a state's liability is \ninferred from its acceptance of federal funds, the state must \"voluntarily and knowingly accept[) \nthe terms of the 'contract.\"' Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; see also Horner, 206 F.3d at 692.~1 \nBecause there can \"be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions,\" id., a \ndamages action is permitted under Title VI only where it would be \"obvious that the grantee was \naware that it was administering the program in violation of the [law].\"  Guardians Ass 'n v.  Civil \nServ. Comm 'n, 463 U.S. 582, 598 (1983).  Put differently, damages arc not available against the \nrecipient of federal funds unless the recipient can reasonably be said to be on notice tlmt its \nconduct will obviously subject it to liability in damages. \nRead togetl1er then, the Supreme Court's decisions in Guardian, Franklin, \nPennhurst and Lago Vista essentially forbid the imposition of a damages remedy against a state \nas the recipient of federal funds where the recipient's conduct does not violate clearly \nestablished legal principles.  Cj United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,270 (1997) (where \nCongress would not intend to impose liability without giving the defendant \"fair warning,\" \nliability will not be imposed unless \"the contours of the right violated arc sufficiently clear that a \nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right\") (citation omitted). \nThis standard plainly bars the claims for damages plaintiff now asserts against the Board of \nRegents.  Where, as in this case, a recipient offedcral funds establishes a policy that is fully \nconsistent with the Supreme Court's statement of the governing legal principles, it is \"sensible to \nThe abrogation of a state's sovereign immunity may also occur as the result of \ncongressional action under the Fourtcentl1 Amendment.  In Franks v. Kentucky Sch. for the Deaf, \n142 F.3d 360 (6th Cir. 1998), the Sixth Circuit held that Title IX represents an abrogation of state \nsovereign immunity.  But as the Supreme Court's subsequent Lago Vista decision makes clear, \nthe question of the scope of that abrogation is governed by Spending Clause principles:  a \nrecipient of federal funds is liable in damages only insofar as-- by accepting federal funds -- it \n\"voluntarily and knowingly acccpt[s] the terms of the contract.\" \n45 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 61 of 65    Pg ID 791\nassume that Congress did not envision a recipient's liability in damages.\"  Lago Vista, 524 U.S. \nat 275. \nThe University of Michigan Law School's Admissions Policy, as demonstrated \nmore fully above, is a flexible policy that does not employ racial quotas and requires all \napplicants to compete against one another according to the same standards and measures of \nachievement.  It complies with Bakke, and therefore cannot be said to be in violation of\"clcarly \nestablished\" legal rules.  Plaintiffs claims to the contrary arc belied by the fact that the United \nStates, which has primary responsibility for enforcing Title VI, has made clear that Bakke \nsupports the competitive consideration of race in admissions in order to attain the educational \nbenefits of a diverse student body.  In this Court, as it has in others, the United States concludes \nthat the \"interest in obtaining the educational benefits of a diverse student body supports an \nappropriately structured plan under which [a] University may take race into consideration as one \nof many factors in making its admissions decisions.\"  Brief of the United States as Amicus \nCuriae at 3.  Moreover, the Department of Education (\"DOE\"), which disburses tl1e Title VI \nfunds at issue here, has published guidelines in the Federal Register-- guidelines on which \nuniversities across the country, including the University of Michigan, rely in administering their \nadmissions programs --that recognize tl1e continued vitality and importance of Bakke in the \nuniversity context.  See 59 Fed. Reg. 8756, 8761 (1994) (\"[C]ollcgcs have a First Amendment \nright to seck diversity in admissions to fulfill t11eir academic mission through the 'robust . \nexchange of ideas' that flows from a diverse student body.\"). \nEarlier this year, the Office for Civil Rights, a division of the Department of \nEducation that is, inter alia, responsible for monitoring compliance with Title VI, relied upon \nthose guidelines in concluding that the University of Chicago Law School's admissions policies \n46 \n\n--\n~ - -~  ---~--· \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 62 of 65    Pg ID 792\n\\ \nfor 1997-98, which considered race as one of many factors in admissions, violated neither Title \nVI nor its implementing regulations.  See Ex. R (Letter to Dr. Don Michael Randel, President, \nUniversity of Chicago, from Linda A. McGovern, Director, Chicago Office, Midwestern \nDivision, Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education, rc: OCR Complaint# 05-97-\n2044 at I (August 14, 2000) (\"OCR concluded that, according to the evidence, the Law School's \nadmissions practices for the 1997-98 entering class included the consideration of race and \nnational origin in a manner that was narrowly tailored to achieve its compelling interest in \nattaining the educational benefits of a diverse student body.\"))  There can be no doubt then that \ndefendants have not violated any clearly established law in operating their Bakke-compliant \nadmissions program. \nThat the vast majority of law schools in this country utilize admissions programs \ndesigned -- consistent with the guidelines set forth in Bakke -- to achieve education-enhancing \ndiversity also attests to the lawfulness of defendants' action in this case.  Both the American Bar \nAssociation and the Association of American Law Schools require, as a condition of \naccreditation and membership, that a law school demonstrate a commitment to having a racially \ndiverse student body.  Sec Ex. P (ABA Standard 211) (\"Consistent with sound legal education \npolicy and the Standards, a law school shall demonstrate, or have carried out and maintained, by \nconcrete action, a commitment to providing full opportunities for the study of law and entry into \nthe professions by qualified members of groups, notably racial and ethnic minorities, which have \nbeen victims of discrimination in various forms.\"); Ex. Q (AALS Bylaws Section 6-4(c)) (\"A \nmember school shall seck to have a faculty, staff, and student body which arc diverse with \nrespect to race, color, and sex.\").  These accrediting legal institutions arc hardly likely to adopt \nrequirements that violate clearly established constitutional law. \n47 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 63 of 65    Pg ID 793\nFinally, the fact that the academic legal community has also assumed that race \nconscious admissions policies arc constitutional under Bakke is significant here.  See, e.g., Akhil \nReed Amar and Neal Katyal, Bakke's Fate, 43 UCLA L. Rev. 1745, 1779 (1996) (\"[O]ur \n[analysis of the case law] suggests that educational affirmative action on a Harvard-plan model \nmay pass Supreme Court muster.  There arc sound reasons why this is so -- reasons that we \nbelieve arc at the heart of Bakke.\").  The prevailing view is clearly that admissions programs \noperated in accordance with Bakke arc constitutional. \nIn light of this, it cannot be seriously maintained that the Board of Regents-- as a \nconsequence of the decision making authority it wields over the Law School and the other \nacademic components of the University of Michigan system-- has violated \"clearly established\" \nlegal principles.  Such an outlandish claim is simply not supported by the record or the law.  The \nLaw School's Admissions Policy comports with Bakke's requirements and, therefore, the Board \nof Regents of the University of Michigan-- at the very least-- is entitled to summary judgment \non the claims for monetary damages plaintiff advances.  It plainly has not waived its sovereign \nimmunity in this case. \n* * * \nThe Law School and the University of Michigan's Board of Regents arc entitled \nto summary judgment on all of the claims for relief-- monetary, as well as declaratory and \ninjunctive-- brought by the plaintiff in this case.  Plaintiffs challenge to any usc of race in \nadmissions is foreclosed by Bakke's holding, in which a majority of the Court expressly \npermitted the \"competitive consideration\" of race as a factor in admissions.  And plaintiffs \nclaim that tl1c Law School violates Bakke just cannot be squared with the undisputed facts in the \nrecord.  The extensive record developed in this litigation confirms that the Law School fully \n48 \n\n- ~-~-~-~~~-~---·----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 216   Filed 10/10/00   Pg 64 of 65    Pg ID 794\ncomplies with Bakke.  Race is considered as one among many factors in the Law School's \nadmissions process, in order to achieve a diverse student body.  Summary judgment in the \ndefendants' favor is therefore appropriate. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Defendants' motion for \nsummary judgment. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPhilip Kessler  h  H.  ick  mg \nLeonard M.

We will address the challenge to the University of Michigan’s \nadmissions policy, Gratz v. Bollinger, Nos. 01-1333, 01-1416, 01-1418, 01-1438, in a forthcoming opinion. \n \n3  Because Title VI, which prohibits racial discrimination in programs receiving federal funds, proscribes only those racial \nclassifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause, this court need only address whether the Law School’s admissions \nprogram is constitutional. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). \n \n4  Because we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in achieving a diverse student body, we do not address whether the \nIntervenors’  proffered  interest-an  interest  in  remedying  past  discrimination-is  sufficiently  compelling  for  equal  protection \npurposes. \n \n5  Because the Marks Court identified the Memoirs opinion with the most limited scope of First Amendment protection as the \n“narrowest,” the dissent suggests that the most narrow opinion under Marks must invariably be “that which construe[s] the \nconstitutional provision in question less potently.” Dissenting Op. at 780 (Boggs, J.). Application of the dissent’s cookie-cutter \nconception of Marks narrowness would preclude consideration of a given decision’s actual gravamen. Moreover, the dissent’s \nnarrowness conception conflicts with both Supreme Court precedent, see City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Co., 486 U.S. 750, \n764-65 n. 9, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), and our own, see Simmons-Harris v. Zelman, 234 F.3d 945, 956-57 (6th \nCir.2000). \nIn Lakewood, the Court examined Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). In Kovacs, a plurality of \nthe Court found that an ordinance flatly prohibiting the use of sound trucks was constitutional. Id. at 82-85, 89, 69 S.Ct. 448\n(plurality opinion of Reed, J.). Two Justices agreed that the flat-prohibition ordinance was constitutional, but reasoned that an \nordinance giving a licensing official unfettered discretion to prohibit the use of sound trucks-that is, an ordinance that would be \nmore conducive to content-based censorship-would also be constitutional. Id. at 89-90, 98, 69 S.Ct. 448 (opinions of Frankfurter, \nJ. and Jackson, J.). Because the plurality would find discretionary-prohibition statutes unconstitutional but would permit \nflat-prohibition statutes and the concurring Justices would find both statutes constitutional, the concurring opinions would be \n“narrower” under the dissent’s conception of Marks. The Supreme Court applied Marks differently: “Clearly, in Kovacs, the \n \n\n \nplurality opinion puts forth the narrowest rationale for the Court’s judgment.” Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 764 n. 9, 108 S.Ct. 2138;\nsee also Zelman, 234 F.3d at 956-57 (examining Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 120 S.Ct. 2530, 147 L.Ed.2d 660 (2000), and \nconcluding that Justice O’Connor’s concurrence-which would require more than a showing of neutrality to find government aid \nto religious schools constitutional-was narrower than the plurality opinion-which would apparently find that neutrality alone \nrenders such aid constitutional); cf. Discovery Network, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 946 F.2d 464, 470 n. 9 (6th Cir.1991)\n(examining Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981)), and citing \nLakewoodand Marksfor the proposition that this court is not bound by the Metromedia plurality’s reasoning that an ordinance, \nwhich unconstitutionally regulated non-commercial speech, would be constitutional as applied to commercial speech because \nthe concurrence argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to both commercial and non-commercial speech. \n \n6  The “narrowest” rationale of a case under Marks must be one capable of supporting the Court’s judgment in that case. See Marks, \n430 U.S. at 193, 97 S.Ct. 990 (“[T]he holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred \nin the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”) (emphasis added) (citation and internal punctuation omitted); see also Triplett Grille,\n40 F.3d at 133-34 (noting that the articulated standard must “necessarily produce results with which a majority of the Court from \nthat case would agree”). Therefore, we reject the Eleventh Circuit’s suggestion in Johnson v. Board of Regents of the University of \nGeorgia, 263 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.2001), that “the narrowest-i.e, less far-reaching-common ground of the Brennan and \nPowell opinions on the specific subject of student body diversity is that diversity is [only] an ‘important’ interest,” because \napplication of an “important interest” rationale to Bakke ‘s facts would produce a judgment contrary to that actually reached by the \nBakke Court. If student body diversity were only an “important” interest, Justice Powell could not join in the Court’s decision to \npermit “the competitive consideration of race and ethnicity” because a plan serving a merely important interest would not survive \nstrict scrutiny. \nMoreover, under Marks, this court must follow the reasoning of the concurring opinion with the narrowest line of reasoning on \nthe issue of why the California Supreme Court could not permanently enjoin Davis from considering race, not-as the dissent \nsuggests-the narrowest line of reasoning capable of being gleaned from a conglomeration of the opinions. DLS, Inc. v. City of \nChattanooga, 107 F.3d 403, 408-09 n. 4 (6th Cir.1997) ( noting that “with respect to a particular issue, [this court] must follow \nthe reasoning of the concurring opinion with the narrowest line of reasoning on that issue”) (emphasis added). Because Justice \nPowell’s opinion provides the narrowest support for Bakke ‘s judgment, we are bound by his reasoning in that opinion; we \ncannot cobble together a holding from various rationales in the discrete Bakkeopinions. Id. (noting that “we do not have the \nfreedom to pick and choose which premises and conclusions we will follow”). Accordingly, we cannot accept the dissent’s \ninvitation to extract two holdings from Bakke by merging analogous portions of the opinions of Justice Powell and the Brennan \nconcurrence. See Dissenting Op. at 783-784 (Boggs, J.). \n \n7  Unless one assumes that the Brennan concurrence would have approved the use of race to further an unconstitutional goal, the \ndissent’s aprioristic assertion that the Brennan concurrence “certainly did not endorse [Justice Powell’s diversity rationale]” flouts \nlogic. See Dissenting Op. at 781 n.6 (Boggs, J.). The operative syllogism is uncomplicated: (1) Under no circumstances may race \nbe used to further unconstitutional goals. (2) The Brennan concurrence agrees, at least under certain circumstances, that Harvard \nmay use race to further its goal. Thus, the Brennan concurrence agrees that Harvard’s goal, ‘achieving an integrated student body,’\nis constitutional. \nIn fact, just as the Supreme Court was bound by statements from discrete Bakke opinions indicating that Title VI’s coverage \nmirrors that of the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Guardians Ass’n v. Civil Service Comm. of New York City, 463 U.S. 582, \n610, 612, 642, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983) and Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 \nL.Ed.2d 517 (2001), this court would be bound by five Bakke Justices’ agreement that Harvard’s diversity goal is constitutional, \nbut for the-unclear-distinction between an “important interest” under intermediate scrutiny and a “compelling interest” under \nstrict scrutiny. \n \n8  Hopwood ‘s reading is akin to construing the sentence “we agree that automobile drivers may drive with their lights on, at least so \nlong as the use of lights to see the road is necessitated by the effects of nightfall” to suggest seeing the road is a permissible goal \nonly at night. Just as whether or not it is night does not qualify the permissibility of trying to see the road, whether or not the use of \nrace is necessitated by past discrimination does not qualify the permissibility of seeking “an integrated student body.” \n \n9  We recognize that the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Justice Powell’s endorsement of the Harvard plan as dicta. See Johnson, 263 \nF.3d at 1261. Even if this portion of Justice Powell’s opinion could be labeled dicta, it is nevertheless dicta from the determinative \nopinion in the only Supreme Court case to address the consideration of race and ethnicity in academic admissions. Accordingly, \nJustice Powell’s endorsement of the Harvard plan carries considerable persuasive authority and provides a more appropriate basis \nfor our opinion than any test we might fashion. \n \n10  The district court credited plaintiffs’ statistical conclusions, but did not incorporate them into its discussion of whether the Law \nSchool’s admission policy was sufficiently narrowly tailored. \n \n1  Judge Boggs responds in his dissent that he does “not contend that the legal opinions of any member of this court do not represent \nthat judge’s principled judgment in this case.” Dissenting Op. at 814. He does contend, however, that the result in the present case \nrepresents unprincipled procedural maneuvering by members of this court. It is this contention to which I object. \n \n\n \n \n2  This response is truly a recourse of last resort, as several members of this court have endeavored to persuade Judge Boggs to\nwithdraw the “Procedural Appendix.” He has steadfastly refused to do so. The three members of the hearing panel have also \npersonally assured Judge Boggs that we did not engage in the manipulation of which he has accused us, but he has refused to \naccept our assurances. \n \n3  My own records indicate that I first saw the May 14, 2001 petition on September 26, 2001, at which time I consulted with the other \nmembers of the hearing panel about circulating the petition to the whole court. \n \n4  Of course, given the composition of the court on August 23, 2001, it would not have made any difference to the outcome of the\ncase whether the en banc petition had been circulated on that date, or in September, or in early October 2001. \n \n5  These objections are also minor in that Judge Boggs does not argue that any of the decisions with which he finds fault actually \nchanged the outcome of the present case. \n \n1  Hereinafter, reference to “the dissent” shall be in regard to Judge Boggs’ dissent, while any reference to Judge Gilman’s dissent \nshall be specifically addressed as such. Judge Batchelder’s dissent is not referenced in this opinion. \n \n2  In this regard, Judge Gilman’s dissent which “assumes without deciding that educational diversity as defined by Justice Powell in \nBakke is a compelling governmental interest” is misguided as well. \n \n3  The dissent originally characterized the black student as being “conventionally liberal.” Then, in response to the criticism that this \nwas in itself stereotypical, the dissent added the parenthetical “or conventionally conservative” to its opinion. This addition, \nhowever, does nothing to change the fact that the dissent is engaging in stereotyping by labeling any minority group as \n“conventionally” of certain views. \n \n4  I bring to the fore the “societal ills”-as the dissent has couched it-of the past and present faced by minorities to illustrate that, \ncontrary to the dissent’s assertion, a minority member of wealthy means may bring to the educational environment the same “life \nexperiences” that a minority member of impoverished means may bring because the “societal ills” experienced by both transcend \neconomic status. Once again, the reader should not be led astray by the dissent’s attempt to ignore or reframe an issue. While it is \ntrue that the Supreme Court has found that a generalized claim of past discrimination cannot serve as the basis for a remedial plan, \nno such claim is being made in this case. \n \n5  Inasmuch as Judge Gilman appears to rest his dissent on his belief that the law school’s policy results in an impermissible quota \nsystem, his conclusion is fallacious as well. \n \n1  I will occasionally use the phrases “race” and “racial” as a shorthand for the type of preference accorded by the Law School. In \nfact, the groups chosen for preference are a melange of groupings that are socially defined: \nby skin color (“black” or “African-American.” I note that the children of Boer or Berber immigrants are not conventionally \ngiven the latter label, which would surely apply to them as a linguistic matter.); \nby national origin (as the Census Bureau carefully notes, “Hispanics” can be of any race. Presumably, the children of the \nformer Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori, though ethnographically purely Japanese, would be considered “Hispanic.”); \nor by legal status (depending on whether Michigan limits “Native American” preference to legally enrolled tribal members, as \nopposed to those with sufficient ancestry of “Indian” status that would qualify a person with comparable black or Hispanic \nancestry for those designations). \nAny shorthand use of those terms in this opinion should be understood to have all the relevant qualifiers. For similar precision \nby other universities with racial and ethnic preferences, see Brief of Amicus Curiae, Columbia Univ., Harvard Univ., Stanford \nUniv., and the Univ. of Penn., in Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 99 LANDMARK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS \nOF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 1977 TERM SUPP. 689, 698 n.3 \n(Phillip B. Kurland & Gerhard Casper, eds., 1978). \n \n2  The concurring opinion does present substantive arguments on this point, which are considered in Part II.A. Concurring Op. at\n759-769 (Clay). \n \n3  The judgment of the Court, affirming the judgment of the California Supreme Court and ordering UC Davis to admit Bakke, was \nsupported by the opinions of Justice Powell, Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. 2733, who would have held that UC Davis’s program \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment, and Justice Stevens, Id. at 421, 98 S.Ct. 2733, who was joined by Chief Justice Burger and \nJustices Stewart and Rehnquist in his argument that the program violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n \n4  The description of the Harvard plan in this amicus brief was exceedingly short and undetailed, consisting of less than four pages. \nFor the description, see LANDMARK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS, supra n. 1, 735-38. \n \n \n\n \n5  The majority quotes from Section V-C of Justice Powell’s opinion, which was joined by the Brennan group and which states: \nIn enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, the courts below failed to recognize that the \nState has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the \ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the California court’s judgment as enjoins \npetitioner from any consideration of the race of any applicant must be reversed. \n438 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (emphasis added). \n \n6  A normal reading of this sentence would be that if the policy in question were necessitated by the lingering effects of past \ndiscrimination, the Brennan group would hold it constitutional. Therefore, if the policy were not so necessitated, one might argue \nby expressio unius that the Brennan group would hold it unconstitutional; at most one might argue that they would be wholly \nagnostic on the constitutionality of such a policy. However, the majority’s grammatical deconstruction, arguing that the footnote \nsomehow provides affirmative support for the proposition that diversity is a compelling state interest, simply does not bear \nexamination. Majority Op. at 742. It is quite correct, as the majority points out, that “at least so long as” does not mean “only if.”\nIbid. However, it does mean “if,” which is all that is necessary to show that the Brennan concurrence-while not affirmatively \nrejecting the Powell diversity rationale-certainly did not endorse it. \nFurther, the majority’s attempt to distinguish between the language modifying when race may be used and why it may be used \nadds nothing, because a temporal qualifier at least hints at some reasoning related to that limitation. If I am told I can only buy \nbeer between the hours of nine and five, it may be because those are the hours when liquor stores are open, or it may be because \nof state legislation limiting beer sales, or it may be because liquor store owners fear shoplifting at other hours; however, each of \nthese rationales is related in a causal way to the time limitation. In just the same way, it may be that Justice Brennan really meant \nonly that race could be used when “necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination,” but this is still a qualification on \nthe scope of Justice Powell’s diversity rationale. \n \n7  Indeed, it is the rule in several of our sister circuits that Marks is simply inapplicable unless “one opinion is a logical subset of \nother, broader opinions.” See King v. Palmer, 950 F.2d 771, 781 (D.C.Cir.1991) (en banc ). See also, e.g., Anker Energy Corp. v. \nConsolidation Coal Co., 177 F.3d 161, 170 (3rd Cir.1999) (“the Marks rule is applicable only where one opinion can be \nmeaningfully regarded as narrower than another and can represent a common denominator of the Court’s reasoning.”); Homeward \nBound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, 963 F.2d 1352, 1359 (10th Cir.1992) (quoting approvingly of the reasoning in King ). Cf. \nDague v. Burlington, 935 F.2d 1343, 1360 (2d Cir.1991) (noting “the anomaly of the views of one justice, with whom no one \nconcurs, being the law of the land, where the Court is so divided on an issue and where there is no majority opinion at all”). The \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit explained well the reason for such a rule: \nWhen, however, one opinion supporting the judgment does not fit entirely within a broader circle drawn by the others, Marks\nis problematic. If applied in situations where the various opinions supporting the judgment are mutually exclusive, Marks will \nturn a single opinion that lacks majority support into national law. When eight of nine Justices do not subscribe to a given \napproach to a legal question, it surely cannot be proper to endow that approach with controlling force, no matter how \npersuasive it may be. \nKing, 950 F.2d at 782. \n \n8  The majority contends that by redefining the relevant judgment I impermissibly “cobble together a holding from various rationales \nin the discrete Bakke opinions.” See Majority Op. at 741 n.6. However, the majority misunderstands my aim. I am not suggesting \nwe apply Marks to a given judgment and then pick and choose among the rationales to support that judgment. Instead, I am merely \nsuggesting an analytical tool whereby we more accurately define the relevant holding before applying Marks. By defining the \nholding as stating that race can be used to promote diversity sometimes, I illustrate that Justice Brennan’s rationale is the narrowest \nin support of that holding and in so doing call into question the premise that Marks provides an answer to the threshold question \nfacing this court. \n \n9  The majority finds support for its proposition that diversity is a compelling state interest in the fact that Justice Brennan in Metro \nBroadcasting cited Bakke for the proposition that “ ‘a diverse student body’ contributing to a ‘robust exchange of ideas’ is a \n‘constitutionally permissible goal’ on which a race-conscious university admissions program may be predicated.” 497 U.S. 547, \n568, 110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-13, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, concurring)). Aside from \nthe fact that Justice Brennan was applying intermediate scrutiny in Metro Broadcasting and therefore his views on the \nconstitutionality of any policy or rationale would not speak to the present case where strict scrutiny is the standard, the statement \nis-as the majority itself notes-merely dicta. The majority attempts to salvage the usefulness of the statement to their argument by \ndescribing it is as “persuasive authority, which this court may not ignore.” Majority Op. at 743. Of course, this court ignores (or at \nleast does not rule in accordance with) persuasive authority all the time. In particular, an ex post exegesis written by a different \nJustice of another Justice’s opinion that did not prevail on the point at issue is hardly the strongest type of persuasive authority. \n \n10  Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices White and Kennedy joined this part of Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion. Justice Scalia \nagreed that the use of race is only appropriate for remedial situations, but wrote separately to contend that it was appropriate only \nin a more limited set of situations than those approved by the plurality. See 488 U.S. at 735, 109 S.Ct. 858 (Scalia, concurring). \n \n11  With respect to the concurring opinion’s criticism of this example, Concurring Op. at n.3 (Clay), see n.21 infra. \n \n\n \n \n12  Indeed, it is likely such minorities-those who have been relatively well-educated at elite schools, but who have not performed \nterribly well there-that the Law School’s preference policy most benefits. \n \n13  In fact, these factors may also correlate to unrealized academic ability, if the student has not had sufficient resources, educational \nor financial, to blossom intellectually. In this sense, an admissions system truly sensitive to experiential diversity may also select \nthe more intellectually talented. \n \n14  A personal observation makes clear for me the problematic nature of such definitions. My daughter has one grandparent who was a \nCuban  immigrant,  two  grandparents  of  Russian  Jewish  origin,  and  one  grandparent  who  could  be  characterized  as  a \nEuro-American mixture. I would hate to think that her life chances were significantly altered, favorably or unfavorably, because a\ngovernment body applied a “grandfather clause” that focused on one rather than another of her grandparents. \n \n15  For more on the one-drop rule, see A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. & F. Michael Higginbotham, “Yearning to Breathe Free”: Legal \nBarriers Against and Options in Favor of Liberty in Antebellum Virginia, 68 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1213, 1243 n.163 (1993). \n \n16  See, e.g., Lucy S. Dawidowicz, THE WAR AGAINST THE JEWS: 1933-45 91 (Bantam 1975); Nora Levin, THE HOLOCAUST \n69-70 (Schocken 1973). \n \n17  The Law School’s disavowal is why I do not discuss whether the remediation of past discrimination is a compelling state interest \nthat could justify the Law School’s actions. Not only must a state interest be compelling to satisfy strict scrutiny, but it must also \nbe the interest that motivated the classification in the first instance. While we have been reluctant to determine what actually \nmotivated legislative bodies, see, e.g., Federal Communications Comm’n v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 \nS.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993), the Law School administration is the sole creator of the admissions policy at issue here and \nwe can rely on its assurance (as compared to the statement of a particular legislator or an incomplete statutory preamble) that such \nremediation is not the purpose of its admissions policy. \n \n18  Because of our society’s history of religious discrimination and religion’s continuing salience, I have at times recognized the \nanalogy between religious preference and the racial and ethnic preference bestowed in this case. For example, at oral argument I \nquestioned counsel about the constitutionality of engineering a critical mass of Southern Baptists at the Law School. Counsel for \nthe Law School attempted to deflect this analogy by arguing that a religious preference of the same form as the Law School’s racial \nand ethnic preference would raise “special” constitutional problems of “getting entangled” with religion in violation of the “First \nAmendment.” Tr. at 16-17. In essence, counsel’s argument was that an admissions policy with religious preferences that would \ncomport with the Equal Protection Clause could nevertheless violate the Establishment Clause. I could find no case or even \nanalytic argument for the proposition that a policy, pursuing a compelling state interest and tailored narrowly to that interest, could \nviolate the Establishment Clause. Cf. Droz v. CIR, 48 F.3d 1120, 1122 (9th Cir.1995) (noting the relevance of the strict scrutiny \nframework to the First Amendment inquiry). With as much justification as the Law School disclaims any invidious animus toward\n“over-represented” groups in its policy, comparable discrimination against “over-represented” religious groups could be said not to \nrepresent the establishment of all other religions or the irreligious. I am convinced that the analogy, and therefore the inevitable \nimplications, of the Law School’s constitutional argument here, hold. \n \n19  Meaning, for these purposes, those students who are not “under-represented minorities.” \n \n20  JA at 603, 605. Comparison between students in the 167-169 LSAT range in 1997. \n \n21  While it should not be necessary to make this point, the use of hypotheticals or examples that illustrate the effective impact of the \npolicies under consideration is in no way a commentary on specific persons. If a policy has real effects that seem impolite or \noffensive, that is a result of the policy, not of those who point it out. \n \n22  Majority applicants with an A average and LSAT over 164 enjoy admission rates over 40%. As their grades slide to a high B \naverage and an LSAT over 164, their admission rates drop to around 20%. Below a 164, majority applicants are not admitted at a \nrate any more than 10%, regardless of their grade point average. \n \n23  By comparison, designated minorities are not only considered, but admitted in rates over 60%, and usually over 80%, with LSAT \nscores down to 154 and grade point averages in the low B range. Even below these figures, designated minorities are still admitted \nat rates nearing 30% in many categories of LSAT and GPA. Not until the designated minorities’ LSAT drops below 150 (47 th\npercentile nationally) or a GPA of 2.5 do we see admission rates under 10% for designated minorities. \n \n24  For example, there is a sharp drop in rates of admission between under-represented minority applicants with a 154 to a 155 LSAT \nscore and those with a 151 to a 153. With a 154 to a 155, we see admission rates in excess of 60%. With a 151 to a 153, however, \nminorities are admitted at rates below 20%. \n \n \n\n \n25  Cf. United States v. Allen, 211 F.3d 970, 976 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc ). \n \n26  The concurring opinion criticizes this statistical analysis by noting scholarship suggesting no good link between “numerical \ncredentials,” presumably meaning LSAT and GPA, and “success in Law School.” Concurring Op. at 768-769 (Clay). My only \npoint here is that, notwithstanding the debate over more accurate measures of educational merit, the Law School undoubtedly \nthinks LSAT and GPA are most important. The only other credential that appears to be systematically important is race, and I \nthink we should at least be candid about how much emphasis that the Law School places on race. To the extent that the \nconcurrence mounts a more substantial attack on the use of numerical credentials generally, its quarrel is with the Law School, not \nwith my position. \n \n27  See, e.g., Tr. at 21-24, where counsel for the Law School admitted that 3-5% would not be enough and that “clearly we care about \nthe number.” \n \n28  The percentage of Harvard students who were Jewish varied between 1933-42, but was quite stable and well below the percentages \nin the 1920’s. In the 1920’s, the percentage consistently approached 30%. A glance at the 1933-42 Harvard figures, with \npercentages of 12.4, 9.9, 10.9, 14.8, 14.0, 15.4, 14.4, 16.0, 14.1, and 16.1, reveals a chart that looks very much like Michigan’s \nwith respect to under-represented minorities. Synnott, THE HALF-OPENED DOOR at 115, Table 4.8 (1971). \n \n29  Admittedly, these percentages did deviate a bit from this tight grouping in some years before 1995 being, respectively, 12%, 14%, \n14%, 13%, 19%, 20%, 14%, 20%, for the years 1987-94. These deviations, however, do not muddle the extraordinarily tight \ngrouping in the last four years and primarily show what may have been, in the Law School’s view, “excessive” percentages in \nthree of the years. Nevertheless, the lowest percentage never falls below 12%, while the Law School acknowledges that \nthree-fourths of that number is accounted for by the application of its preference policy. \nOf course, even these early numbers are consistent with the Law School’s maintaining a numerical target. Perhaps the Law \nSchool had a different target in those years. It is hard to know, because the Law School has failed to specify its view of “critical \nmass.” Perhaps the Law School simply got better at exactly achieving its target. \n \n30  There is little solace in the Law School’s unwillingness to reveal its quota. I share Justice Brennan’s view: “there is no basis for \npreferring a particular preference program simply because in achieving the same goals [as a quota system], it proceeds in a manner \nthat is not immediately apparent to the public.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 379, 98 S.Ct. 2733. \n \n31  This discussion highlights the overlapping nature of the two-step equal protection analysis. One might think that a discussion of the \nbenefits of diversity would be better placed in the analysis of whether diversity in education is a compelling state interest. At this \npoint, it is important to be precise. No one, not even the Law School or Justice Powell, claims that diversity for its own sake can \nconstitute a compelling state interest. Instead, the claim is that diversity yields race-neutral benefits that are themselves compelling. \nMore precisely speaking, diversity in education is a means of achieving the compelling state interest in the benefits of diversity. \n \n32  The report claims that the educational benefits that positively correlate with diversity include “graduate degree aspirations,” “drive \nto succeed,” and “academic ability.” Gurin also notes, in passing, that the favorable outcomes for African-American students, with \nwhich she reports a correlation to her diversity measures, do not include actual learning as measured by grade point average. See\nJA at 2355; Patricia Gurin, The Compelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education, 5 Mich. J. of Race and L. 363, 391 (1999). \n \n33  The democratic benefits include “influencing social values,” “helping others in difficulty,” and “being involved in environmental \nactivities.” \n \n34  Although there are two concurring opinions in this case, only Judge Clay’s addresses the substantive portion of this dissent. My \nreferences in the text to the “Concurring Opinion” refer to Judge Clay’s. I will make a more specific reference when referring to \nJudge Moore’s concurring opinion. \n \n35  The relationship between diversity and these assorted educational benefits could be proportional, exponential, or stepwise. If it \nwere merely proportional, there would appear to be no basis for the Law School’s attempts to achieve a “critical mass,” rather than \neach marginal “under-represented minority” bringing equal benefit. \n \n36  I am not alone in questioning the conclusions of the Gurin Report and the poverty of the empirical evidence presented. A social \nscientist and supporter of affirmative action in education evaluating some of the same data that Gurin used, but also examining \nactual student body diversity, concluded that “academic outcomes are generally not affected” by student body diversity, and that \nthe effects that are indicated are “very weak and indirect.” Alexander W. Astin, WHAT MATTERS IN COLLEGE? 362 \n(Jossey-Bass 1993). As we might expect from the vague list of claimed benefits, this researcher’s study concluded that “[t]he \nvalues, attitudes, and socioeconomic status of the peer group are much more important determinants of how the individual student \nwill develop than are the peer group’s abilities, religious orientation, or racial composition.” Id. at 363, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Accordingly, \na candid and empirically rigorous affirmative action supporter has admitted that a link between racial diversity and improved \neducational results has “yet to be convincingly demonstrated” and that “[t]he research still needs to be done that would \n \n\n \ndemonstrate the link.” Peter Schmidt, Debating the Benefits of Affirmative Action, CHRON. OF HIGHER EDUC.. A25 (May 18, \n2001). \n \n37  Even more fundamentally, social science data as to the efficacy, in the eyes of one or another researcher, of policies of \ndiscrimination are themselves of limited utility in resolving the ultimate constitutional issue. At the time of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), there were certainly researchers with academic degrees who argued \nthat segregated education would provide greater educational benefits for both races. Does anyone think that a factual belief in such \nanalyses would have, or should have, led to a different constitutional outcome in Brown? I very strongly doubt it. Similarly, \nresearch asserting that Jews and Gentiles in fact interacted more harmoniously under Lowell’s Harvard plan would not justify that \npolicy either. \nI note that this question is not simply of academic or antiquarian interest. Questions have been raised as to the ability or \ndesirability of school districts implementing all-black academies in order to improve educational performance. See Wil \nHaygood, Rethinking Integration: On Schools, Many Blacks Return to Roots, BOSTON GLOBE (Nov. 16, 1997). I sincerely \ndoubt that the factual outcome of conflicts between social scientists as to varying studies of the educational effect of such\npolicies would be dispositive of the constitutional question that might be raised. See Drew S. Days, III, Brown Blues: Rethinking \nthe Integrative Ideal, in REDEFINING EQUALITY (Neal Deavins and Davison M. Douglas, eds., Oxford 1998) (noting, while \ndiscussing the possibility of all-black public educational institutions, that “[e]xpedience cannot legitimize racial segregation”). \n \n38  The concurring opinion suggests that evidence of racial and gender bias in LSAT and GPA figures would render the lottery \nrace-conscious. Concurring Op. at 771 (Clay). Of course, the lottery itself would be completely race-neutral. I do not see how \nusing the Law School’s “qualification” threshold, with which no party or judge has heretofore quarreled, to restrict the lottery \nwould make the lottery race-conscious. \n \n39  Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865. \n \n40  The concurring opinion responds that, in a world without affirmative action, applicants like Grutter will not be much better off. \nConcurring Op. at 766-768 (Clay). To make its point, the concurring opinion quotes at length the opinion, interlaced with some\nstatistics, set forth in a recent Washington Post column. See Goodwin Liu, The Myth and Math of Affirmative Action, WASH. \nPOSTT B1 (April 14, 2002). The concurring opinion asserts, on the basis of this evidence, that the idea that an admissions policy \ndoes so at the expense of white applicants is simply a myth. Concurring Op. at 766. \nThe Liu analysis simply does not support the concurring opinions conclusion. First, the article explicitly states that its argument \napplies just as forcefully to Alan Bakke. But the Supreme Court certainly did not deny Bakke’s claim because he could not \nprove with mathematical certainty that he would have received one of the sixteen places improperly segregated from the general \napplicant pool. \nSecond, the article gives the game away when it candidly states that its statistical conclusion “occurs in any selection process in \nwhich the applicants who do not benefit from affirmative action greatly outnumber those who do.” Liu, supra, at B1; Concurring \nOp. at 747 (emphasis added). \nIt is true that there is a very real sense in which the wrong committed against a person absolutely barred from consideration for a \ngovernmental benefit is greater than the wrong committed against a person only deprived of a fair chance of consideration. \nBut a wrong has still been committed. The concurring opinion and Liu may not characterize that wrong as a “substantial \ndisadvantage,” ibid., but the deprivation of equal consideration is a wrong to which the Constitution is opposed. \nThere may have been hundreds of Jews each year who were denied a fair chance for consideration by the Harvard quota plan, \neven though a far smaller number of actual seats were involved and most such applicants could not have been certain of \nadmission. They would not have been comforted by the force of Liu’s arguments. \nTo say that it is a matter of less importance that ten people are each deprived of a one-tenth chance of admission because of race \nthan if one person is completely excluded from admission is to ignore both mathematics and our system of deciding cases and \ncontroversies. If Grutter’s rights have been violated, the degree of the violation and the proper remedy are matters for the district \ncourt to determine in the first instance. To say that Grutter’s claims are to be ignored because the whole system that she has \nchallenged has a relatively small discriminatory impact or because the magnitude of the violation as to her is small is to say that \nshe has no rights that this court is bound to respect. I decline to take that attitude. \n \n41  See,  e.g.,  R.  Richard  Banks, Meritocratic  Values  and Racial  Outcomes:  Defending  Class-Based  College  Admissions,  79 \nN.C.L.Rev. 1029, 1062 (2001) (noting that “[a] variety of studies have demonstrated positive relationships between early academic \nachievement and parental income, education, and occupation.”); Tomiko Brown-Nagin, “Broad Ownership” of the Public Schools: \nAn Analysis of the “T-Formation” Process Model for Achieving Educational Adequacy and Its Implications for Contemporary \nSchool Reform Efforts, 27 J.L. & Educ. 343, 385 (1998) (noting that “comparative indicia showing the relationship between \nsocioeconomic background and academic performance continues to reveal a persistent gap in achievement between wealthier and \npoorer students”). \n \n42  It is not clear that preliminary motions can be redirected from a randomly selected motions panel to a purported “must panel” when \nno appeal has been filed. \n \n \n\n \n43  Petitions for initial hearing en banc were filed in nine cases in the year 2000. Two of the cases, both filed pro se, were disposed of \nwithout circulating the en banc petition to the court. See Docket Sheets in Naturalite v. Ciarlo, No. 00-2106, decided under Rule \n34, 22 Fed.Appx. 506 (2001) and in Griffin v. Warren, No. 00-4552 (petition for certificate of appealability denied). \nIn each of the other seven cases, the petition for initial hearing en banc was circulated to the court no later than two days after \nthe appellee’s proof brief was filed. All were disposed of by the full court before the final briefs were filed. \n \n44  The question of the circumstances under which Judge Norris and/or Judge Suhrheinrich could have sat on a potential en banc court \nhearing the case could be a matter of some contention. Under the circuit rule in place at the time, “any judge who had been in \nregular active service at the time a poll was requested on the petition” for an en banc hearing would be a member of the en banc\ncourt hearing the case. 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) (1998) (emphasis added). As Judge Gilman discussed in his separate opinion in \nPopovich v. Cuyahoga Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, 276 F.3d 808, 829 (6th Cir.2002) (en banc ), there is a substantial question \nregarding whether our rule in effect at the time was consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 46(c), governing the composition of courts of \nappeals en banc. Nevertheless, that was the rule we followed until October 31, 2001. We subsequently changed our rule to \ncompose the en banc court of all judges in regular active service “at the time of oral argument en banc.” 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) \n(2002). \nThe old rule would have governed all the relevant en banc court composition issues that I have raised here. From Popovich, we \nknow that this court’s precedent is, at least by permitting Judge Merritt to sit in that case, that our old Policy 35(a) is not \nstatutorily invalid. Thus, both Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich could have sat on the en banc court if the petition had been \ncirculated earlier. Judge Norris would have been a part of the en banc court in this case if a vote on the petition had been \nrequested by July 1, over 45 days after the petition had been filed. Judge Suhrheinrich would have been a part of the court if a \nvote had been requested by August 15, over 90 days after the petition was filed and more than 15 days after the completion of\nbriefing. The specially constituted panel’s withholding the petition from the court until October 15, 2001, 150 days after it had \nbeen filed and 75 days after the completion of briefing, had the effect of potentially keeping both judges off an en banc court. \n \n45  Judge Moore’s reference to a December 5, 2000 policy imposed by the Chief Judge omits several important features of the policy. \nSee Concurring Op. at 754-755. First, the policy states that it was prompted by petitions for initial hearing en banc from “pro se\nlitigants, mainly prisoners,” not from counsel in important cases. It specifically states that it does not apply if the Chief Judge and \nclerk agree that “it is an unusual case.” I think we can all agree that this case was unusually important. Second, the policy \nauthorized two and only two actions by the hearing panel to which the case and the petition is referred. The panel could either\n“deny the petition” and schedule the case for argument before the panel or “send the petition out to the en banc court.” Neither \noccurred here. The policy never authorized the panel to schedule argument and not to decide the petition. Third, the policy directed \nthe panel to circulate the petition to the en banc court if it saw “some legitimate argument for hearing en banc.” It strains credulity \nto argue now, after the petition has been granted, that the petition contained no “legitimate argument” for its granting. \n \n46  In early October, one senior judge of our court became concerned about the procedures that had been followed in this case, namely \nthe specially constituted panel that had taken over this case. After that judge made several unsuccessful efforts to speak with the \nChief Judge, on October 15 he faxed to the Chief Judge a letter setting forth his concerns as to whether court rules and policies had \nbeen followed in this case. He received no response or any other communication regarding this letter (and has not, to this day). \nHowever, on the same day that he sent that letter, with the hearing only eight days away, a decision was made to circulate the \npetition for an en banc hearing. \n \n47  Judge Clay’s concurring opinion suggests that I “question [ ] the appropriateness of hearing this case en banc ” and then argues \nwhy hearing important cases en banc is good. Concurring Op. at 772, 773. I have no opinion on the substance of the decision to \nhear this case en banc, only the procedures used to dictate its timing. \n \n48  There is precedent for the special administration of a high-profile case. In Mozert v. Hawkins Cty. Bd. of Educ., 827 F.2d 1058 (6th \nCir.1987), then-Chief Judge Lively took the case out of the normal hearing schedule because of educational time constraints and its \nimportance. Rather than personally constituting a special panel, the Chief Judge, after suggesting the procedure to all the active \njudges on the court, had the clerk conduct a random draw of circuit judges to constitute the panel. Pursuant to the drawing, the \nChief Judge, as a matter of coincidence, was randomly selected. This process occurred in a matter of days, and never threatened to \ndelay the case. If such a transparent process had been followed here, the procedural issues noted in this appendix probably would \nnot have arisen. \n \n49  Neither of the concurring opinions addressing this appendix disputes any of the factual circumstances described. \nJudge Clay argues that no negative conclusions regarding any member of this court can be drawn from the handling of this case. \nConcurring Op. at 773 (Clay). I draw no such conclusions in this appendix. It may be possible that each of these events occurred \nwithout conscious direction. Each reader can make an independent judgment from the apparently undisputed facts that I have \nlaid out here. Frankly, I would have been most pleased if my statement of apparent facts had been proven wrong. Unfortunately, \nthat has not occurred. \nJudge Moore correctly states that our “only source of democratic legitimacy is the perception that we engage in principled \ndecision-making.” Concurring Op. at 753 (Moore). If actions are taken that may imperil that legitimacy, a member of this court \nwho observes them is left with two alternatives, both unpalatable. One is to allow the actions to pass in silence, even after \n \n\n \nexplanations have been requested, but have not been produced. Silence simply allows those actions to continue and to be \nrepeated, with real consequences for both the court and the litigants who appear before it. \nThe other alternative is to place the actions on the record, for such remediation as may be possible. \nI have not revealed the substance of any internal communications on this case between members of our court, with the exception \nof the letter of one senior judge who asked me to do so. See n.46 supra. Compare Concurring Op. at 772 & 764 n.3 (Clay); \nConcurring Op. at 757 (Moore). As to Judge Clay’s discussion of my opinion in Memphis Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist, 184 \nF.3d 600, 605-07 (6th Cir.1999) (Boggs, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc ), Concurring Op. at 772-773 (Clay), I \nwill leave to the candid reader to consider the distinction between laying out very significant and obvious violations of rights of \nmembers of this court, and revealing, in contravention of long-honored custom, the internal votes of members of this court. \nLegitimacy protected only by our silence is fleeting. If any damage has been done to the court, it is the work of the actors, not \nthe reporters. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n ",

Pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(e)(2), \nthe court shall decide this motion without oral argument. \nBackground \nOn December 3, 1997, plaintiff Barbara Grutter commenced this action under 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 2000d on behalf of herself and others similarly situated.  Gruttcr, who is \nwhite, alleges that in June 1997 The University ofMichigan Law School rejected her application for \nadmission because ofh er race. Gruttcr alleges that the law school has an admissions policy whereby \n\"students from favored racial groups had a significantly greater chance of admission than students \nwith similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.\" Complaint, ,[20.  Plaintifffurther alleges \nthat \"race was one of the predominant factors ... used for determining admission\" and that this \n,1,1 \npolicy is not justified by any compelling state interest.  I d.  23, 24.  Plaintiff claims that \ndefendants have violated her Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection and a federal statute \nprohibiting racial discrimination by educational institutions receiving federal funds, 42 U.S.C. § \n2000d.  She seeks damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorney fees and costs.

The first part is addressed to the chief \njudge and seeks an order of reassignment pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 83.11 (b )(2).  The second \npart is addressed to me and seeks an order designating two actions as companion cases pursuant \nto E.D. Mich. LR 83.11 (b )(7)(A).  This opinion resolves only the second part of defendants' \nmotion. \n2 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 3 of 19    Pg ID 213\n.. \n. \n--~-\nevaluated less favorably because of their race. \nOn October 14, 1997, plaintiffs Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher commenced \nCivil Action No. 97-75231  against Lee Bollinger (the current president of The University of \nMichigan), James J. Dudcrstadt (the president ofThc University ofMichigan immediately preceding \nBollinger), The University ofMichigan, and The University ofMichigan College ofLitcrature, Arts \nand Science (\"LS&A\").  The 97-75231 matter is assigned to Judge Patrick J. Duggan of this court. \nGratz and Hamacher, both of whom arc white, allege that in 1995 and 1997, respectively, The \nUniversity of Michigan's LS&A undergraduate college rejected their applications for admission \nbecause of their race.  They allege that the undergraduate college has an admissions policy which \nfavors certain racial groups over others; that race is a predominant factor in the admissions process; \nand that this policy is not justified by any compelling state interest. Sec Gratz Complaint, ,[,[19, 22, \n23. Plaintiffs Gratz and Hamacher claim that defendants have violated their Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  They seck damages, injunctive and declaratory \nrelief, and attorney fees and costs, and propose to represent a class of LS&A applicants whose \napplications for admission were evaluated less favorably because of race. \nOn July 15, 1998, defendants filed a motion in the Gruttcr matter seeking at page one \nthe following relief: \n1. Pursuant to Local Rule 83 .II (b )(2), Defendants hereby move the \nChief Judge (or her designee) for an order reassigning Gmttcr v. \nBollinger. ct al., Civil Action No. 97-75928 (E.D. Mich. 1997) from \nJudge Friedman to Judge Duggan, who is presiding over Gratz. ct al. \nv. Bollinger. ct al., Civil Action No. 97-75231 (E.D. Mich. 1997). \n2. Alternatively, pursuant to Local Rule 83.11 (b)(7)(A), Defendants \nmove Judge Friedman for an  order designating these matters as \n\"companion cases.\" \n3 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 4 of 19    Pg ID 214\n.. \nMotion for Reassignment Pursuant to Local Rule 83.11 (b)(2)2 \nIn support of their first request -- for reassignment pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR \n83.11 (b )(2) -- defendants argue that the complaints in Gmtter and Gratz  arc \"virtually identical\"; \nthat the parties arc represented by the same attorneys in both cases; that in the two cases \"most of \nthe defendants overlap\"; and that reassignment \"will promote docket efficiency and conserve judicial \nresources by avoiding duplication of efforts and the risk of inconsistent rulings.\" Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of Defendants' Motion, p. 1. \nDefendants' motion, which bears only the Gmtter caption and civil action number, \nwas filed on July 15, 1998.  The motion is accompanied by a cover letter dated July 15, 1998, \naddressed to Chief Judge Taylor.  Copies of the motion, and of the cover letter, were also delivered \nto me, to Judge Duggan, and to all counsel of record.  The second paragraph of defendants' cover \nletter states: \nLocal Rule 83.11 (b )(2) requires that this Motion be addressed to \nyou.  As your spouse is a member of the Board of Regents of the \nUniversity ofMichigan, which has been named as a defendant in this \nlitigation, we anticipate that you will  likely direct this matter to \nanother judge for consideration. \nOn July 23, 1998, Chief Judge Taylor issued an Order of Disqualification and Transfer.  In this \n2E.D. Mich. LR 83.11 (b )(2) states: \nTo promote docket efficiency, or to conform to the requirement \nof any case management plan adopted by the Court, or upon \nconsent of the parties, or after notice and hearing, or in the interests \nofj ustice, the Chief Judge may order a civil case to be reassigned, \nbut only with the consent of the Judge to whom the case was \noriginally assigned and with the consent of the Judge to whom it is \nto be reassigned. \n4 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 5 of 19    Pg ID 215\norder, which bears only the Gmtter caption and civil action number, Chief Judge Taylor stated that \nshe \"must disqualify herself from consideration of the motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455, for the \nreason that her spouse, a Regent of the Defendant University, is a Defendant in both of the lawsuits \nin issue.\"  Chief Judge Taylor further ordered that \"the motion be and hereby is reassigned for \nconsideration and decision by the two former Chief Judges of this Court who remain in service, \nJudge John Fcikens and Judge Julian Abele Cook, Jr.\" \nOn July 31, 1998, Judges Fcikens and Cook, sitting as a two-judge panel, conducted \na hearing \"to determine whether or not these two cases, the Barbara Gruttcr case and the other case, \nGratz ct al., arc companion cases.\" Hearing Transcript, p. 4.  The hearing transcript bears only the \ncaption and civil action number of the Gmtter matter. \nOn  August  6,  1998,  Judges  Fcikens  and  Cook  issued  a  5-page  \"opinion.\" \nInexplicably, this \"opinion\" bears the caption and civil action number not only of Gruttcr but also \nof Gratz.  This \"opinion\" was filed on August 6, 1998, and entered on the docket in the Gmtter \naction on August 7, 1998; however, this \"opinion\" has not been entered on the docket in the Gratz \naction.  Judges Feikcns and Cook, acting \"as designees of Hon. Anna Diggs Taylor\" and as a \n\"specially convened judicial panel,\" \"opinion,\" p. 1, stated that \nThe Gmtter Defendants moved for reassignment pursuant to E.D. \nMich. LR 83.11 (b )(2) or for a designation of the case as a companion \nto Gratz undcrE.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(7), and presented these issues \nto ChicfJudgc Anna Diggs Taylor. Upon disqualifying herself from \nconsidering the motion because her husband  is  a Regent of the \nUniversity of Michigan in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 455, Chief \nJudge Taylor entered an Order on July 23, 1998 that reassigned the \nmotion to this judicial panel. \nAs argued by the parties, the sole and narrow issue we arc called \nupon to decide is whether Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases \nunder E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(7). \n5 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 6 of 19    Pg ID 216\n. .  ..   -\n\"Opinion,\" p. 2.  The \"opinion\" did not make any finding or conclusion regarding the portion of \ndefendants' motion which was addressed to ChicfJudgc Taylor- namely, the first prong, which \nseeks reassignment pursuant to  E.D.  Mich.  LR 83.11 (b )(2).  Instead,  the \"opinion\" focused \nexclusively on the portion of defendants' motion which was addressed to me-namely, the second \nprong, which seeks an order designating the two cases as companions pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR \n83.11(b)(7)(A). Judges Feikcns and Cook \"conclude[d ) that Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases \nunder the provisions of Local Rule 83.11(b )(7).\" \"Opinion,\" p. 5.  The \"opinion\" docs not purport \nto either grant or deny defendants' motion; the motion seeks an order of reassignment, whereas the \n\"opinion\" is not accompanied by an order, but appears to be more in the nature of an advisory \nopinion.3 \nThe court shall strike the \"opinion\" of Judges Fcikcns and Cook from the record of \nthis case. Judges Fcikens and Cook have no authority to take any action or issue any rulings in this \ncase, and their \"opinion\" is a nullity. \nJudges Feikcns and Cook lacked authority for several reasons. First, their designation \nby the Chief Judge was unlawful.  When Chief Judge Taylor disqualified herself, a federal statute \nrequired that she assign the portion of defendants' motion addressed to her to \"the district judge in \nactive service, present in the district and able and qualified to act, who is next in precedence.\" 28 \nU.S.C. § 136(c).4 Iffor whatever reason ChicfJudge Taylor believed this statute did not apply, she \n3Courts in the American legal system, by long-standing tradition and case law, do not \nissue advisory opinions.  Sec 13 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3529.1 \n(1984). \n4 28 U.S.C. § 136(c) states:  \"If a chiefj udge is temporarily unable to perform his duties \nas such, they shall be performed by the district judge in active service, present in the district and \n6 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 7 of 19    Pg ID 217\n. .  .. \nmight instead have elected to reassign the portion of defendants' motion addressed to her to another \njudge by blind draw pursuant to B.D. Mich. LR 83.1!(d)(!).5  This alternative procedure would at \nleast have protected the appearance of fairness and impartiality. However, Chief Judge Taylor \nfollowed neither § 136( a) nor Local Rule 83.11 (d)( I), but instead devised her own, novel procedure, \nwhereby she reassigned the entire motion (not just the portion addressed to her) to two judges whom \nshe personally selected to act as a special two-judge panel. \nIn her Order of Disqualification and Transfer, Chief Judge Taylor docs not cite any \nauthority permitting her to reassign defendants' motion, or any portion thereof, to any other judge \nor judges she has personally selected. Nor has the court succeeded in discovering any statute, local \ncourt rule, or precedent authorizing this method of reassignment.  To the contrary, by statute, case \nlaw, and common sense, once the chiefj udge disqualified herself she was duty bound to refrain from \ntaking any further action in the matter whatsoever. \nWhile ChicfJudge Taylor recognized that she must disqualify herself pursuant to 28 \nable and qualified to act, who is next in precedence.\" \n5 Local Rule 83.11(d)(l) states: \nIn Ann Arbor, Detroit, Flint and Port Huron, when a Judge to \nwhom a case is assigned is disqualified from hearing it, the Clerk \nshall reassign the case in accordance with (a)(!). \nLocal Rule 83.11(a)(l), in tum, states in relevant part: \nIn Ann Arbor, Detroit, Flint and Port Huron, the Clerk shall \nemploy, a random method for the assignment to Judges of civil \ncases and special civil cases .... \n7 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 8 of 19    Pg ID 218\n.  .. \n. \nU.S.C. § 455, 6 she nonetheless violated her legal and ethical duty by selecting the judicial officers \nwho were to act in her stead.  As one respected treatise has noted, \nWhen the chief judge of a district is disqualified under § 455, the \nchiefj udge should not be the one to assign the case to another judge, \nsince this would violate the statutory command that the disqualified \njudge be removed from all participation in the case and, in addition, \nmight  create  suspicion  that  the  disqualified judge will  select  a \nsuccessor whose views arc consonant with his own. \n32 Am. Jur. 2d Federal Courts§ 52 (1995).  American .Turispmdcncc cites as case authority for this \nproposition McCuin v. Texas Power & Light Co., 714 F.2d 1255 (S'h Cir. 1983). In McCuin, a chief \njudge disqualified himself and assigned the case to another district judge of his own choosing.  In \nremanding, the Fifth Circuit ordered that the case be reassigned \"in accordance with local practice, \nif one exists\" or, alternatively, to the senior active judge in accordance with 28 U.S. C. § 136(c). !d. \nat 1261.  The court noted that a chief judge \"patently ... has no authority to sign [an order of \nassignment], or any other judicial order, pertaining to a proceeding in which he is disqualified .... \nCongress intended the statutory antisepsis to be absolute in order to avoid any bacterium of \nimpugnment.\" !d.  Sec also R. Flamm, Judicial Disqualification § 22.3.2 (1996) (\"The reasons for \nthe rule prohibiting a disqualified judge from having any input into the reassignment of the case arc \nplain.  To permit a disqualified judge to participate in the selection of his successor judge would \nviolate the rule that a disqualified judge must be removed from all participation in the case ....\" ). \nBy continuing to act after disqualifying herself, Chief Judge Taylor clearly violated§ 455, and any \naction taken subsequent to her disqualification is a nullity. Sec id § 22.4.1 (\"When a judge presumes \n\"Under § 455(b )(S)(i), a judge must disqualify herself if her spouse \"(i]s a party to the \nproceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party.\" \n8 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 9 of 19    Pg ID 219\n--\nto take substantive action in a case despite having recused himself from it ... any such action is \noften considered a nullity and any orders issued by such a judge arc considered absolutely void for \nwant ofj urisdiction.\"). \nChicfJudgc Taylor's order oftransfcr also violates 28 U.S.C. § 137, which states that \nthe court's business \"shall be divided among the judges as provided by the rules and orders of the \ncourt.  The chiefj udge of the district court shall be responsible for the observance of such rules \nand orders, and shall divide the business and assign the cases so far as such rules and orders do not \notherwise prescribe.\" (Emphasis supplied.) The \"rules and orders of the court\" clearly provide for \na case to be randomly reassigned in the event of disqualification. The random assignment of cases, \nand the random reassignment in the event of disqualification, has the obvious, commonsensical and \nbeneficial purpose of maintaining the public's confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.  This \npurpose is defeated when cases or motions arc assigned, or reassigned, to judges who arc hand \npicked to decide the particular case or motion in question. A system ofr andom assignment is purely \nobjective and is not open to the criticism that business is being assigned to particular judges in \naccordance with any particular agenda.  The subjective method employed in the present case was \nanything but random, and at a minimum the appearance of impropriety is manifest.  Chief Judge \nTaylor's decision to disregard the procedure prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § !36(c) and the alternative \nblind draw procedure prescribed by this court's own local rules, tarnishes this court's appearance of \nfairness and appears to place the court's imprimatur upon a judge-shopping practice which we, \ncollectively as a bench, in the past always have denounced. \nThe infirmity of Chief Judge  Taylor's order is  compounded  by the  fact  that \ndefendants' motion was reassigned to not one, but two judges ofthis court. The court has searched \n9 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 10 of 19    Pg ID 220\n. \n... \n•'  •' \ndiligently, using computer data bases as we II as ail of the other resources available to it, but has been \nunable to discover any statute, local court rule, or precedent authorizing the appointment at the \ndistrict court level of a \"two-judge panel\" for any purpose.  While three-judge panels arc known to \nthe federal system at both the district and circuit levels, 7 a two-judge panel apparently has never-\nuntil now-been convened within any United States District Court.  Not only docs such a creature \nnot exist; its existence is positively inconsistent with both 28 U.S.C. § 136(c), which requires the \nduties of a chiefj udge who is temporarily unable to act to be performed by \"the district judge\" (not \njudges) next in prccedcncc, and with this court's and the American legal system's long-standing \npractice of assigning a case or motion, at the trial level, to a single judge. \nChief Judge Taylor's Order of Disqualification  and  Transfer suffers  from  an \nadditional defect which further detracts from its legitimacy: The order purports to reassign both \nportions of defendants' motion to Judges Fcikcns and Cook, although only the first portion -\nnamely, the request for an order of reassignment pursuant to Local Rule 83.11 (b )(2)-was directed \nto the chiefj udge. The second portion-namely, the request for an order designating the two cases \nas companions pursuant to Local Rule 83.11 (b )(7)(A)-is specifically addressed to me, and not to \nthe chicfjudgc. Nonetheless, ChicfJudgc Taylor's order reassigned both requests to Judges Fcikcns \nand Cook, stating: \nDefendants having filed a motion before Chief Judge Anna Diggs \nTaylor in the above-entitled matter, requesting that she, as Chief \nJudge, reassign the matter pursuant to L.R. 83.11 (b)(2) to the judge \nto whom an earlier-filed case has been assigned; or in the alternative, \n7 Sec, Q,g,, 28 U.S.C. § 46(b) (three-judge circuit court panels); 28 U.S.C. § 2284 (three \njudge district courts); E.D. Mich. LR 83.22(g)(1) (three-judge panels in attorney reinstatement \nproceedings). \n10 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 11 of 19    Pg ID 221\n.. \nI  #*  ' _t \nthat the matter be reassigned as a companion case to the predecessor \ncase, pursuant to L.R. 83.11 (b )(7); ... \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion be and hereby is \nreassigned for consideration and decision by the two former Chief \nJudges of this Court who remain in service, Judge John Feikcns and \nJudge Julian Abele Cook, Jr. \nChicfJudge Taylor had authority to reassign the first portion ofd efendants' motion to another judge, \nby the procedure set forth in either 28 U.S.C. § 136(e) or E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(d)(l) and (a)(!), but \nshe had no authority to reassign the second portion of defendants' motion by any procedure. \nThe court concludes that Chief Judge Taylor acted without authority when she \nreassigned both portions of defendants' motion to a hand-picked, two-judge panel.  Because this \ntwo-judge panel was constituted unlawfully, it lacked any authority to convene, to hear argument, \nto issue any opinion or decision, or to take any action of any kind whatsoever in this case. The court \ntherefore concludes that the August 6, 1998, \"opinion\" ofJudges Fcikens and Cook is a nullity, void \nab initio, and without any purpose or effect whatsoever.H The docketing of this \"opinion\" in a case \nproperly assigned to a judge by blind draw, is an affront to the dignity and the independence of the \ncourt and an unlawful intrusion upon and interference and meddling with this court's business. The \ncourt shall therefore strike this \"opinion\" from the docket of Civil Action No. 97-75928. \nThe court notes that the \"opinion\" itsclflacks legitimacy for reasons aside from, and \nHRegrcttably, Judges Fcikcns and Cook continued to participate in this proceeding even \nafier I personally called to their attention, by a memorandum circulated to all members of this \ncourt on July 31, 1998, that (I) two-judge panels do not exist, (2) a disqualified judge may not \nselect his/her successor judge, (3) this court's local rule on disqualification ofj udges calls for the \nusc of reassignment by blind draw, (4) 28 U.S.C. § 136(c) specifics the judge who is to act when \na chiefj udge is temporarily unable to do so, and (5) my consent to a reassignment would be \nrequired in any event and I do not consent. \nI I \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 12 of 19    Pg ID 222\nI  ',' \nin addition to, the fact that the two-judge panel was unlawfully constituted.  As noted above, \ndefendants' motion presented only one request to Chief Judge Taylor- namely, that Gruttcr be \nreassigned to Judge Duggan pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 83.1l(b)(2).  Defendants' other request, \nfor designation of the two cases as companions pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(7)(A), was \nspecifically directed to me, and not to the chief judge.  Nonetheless, the two-judge panel, through \nJudge Feikcns, indicated at the hearing that the panel's \"purpose is to determine whether or not these \ntwo cases ... arc companion cases.\"  Hearing Transcript, p. 4.  The panel's focus throughout the \nhearing was whether Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases within the meaning of Local Rule \n83.11(b)(7).  Sec id. at 4, 7, 8, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23.  Reassignment under Local Rule 83.11(b)(2), \nwhich defendants had specifically addressed to Chief Judge Taylor, was never mentioned at the \nhearing by either member of the two-judge panel.  Thus, the two-judge panel devoted the hearing \nto consideration of an issue never presented to the chief judge, and essentially ignored the issue \nwhich had been presented to her. \nThe \"opinion\" likewise asserts that \"[d ]cfcndants moved for reassignment pursuant \nto E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(2) or for a designation ofthc case as a companion to Gratz under E.D. \nMich.  LR 83.11(b)(7),  and  presented  these  issues  to  Chief Judge Anna  Diggs  Taylor.\" \n\"Opinion,\" p. 2 (emphasis supplied).  Of course, only the first issue was presented to Chief Judge \nTaylor.  The \"opinion\" also incorrectly asserts that \"the sole and narrow issue we arc called upon \nto decide is whether Gruttcr and Gratz arc companion cases under E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(7).\" Jd. \nObviously, this is not the issue defendants presented to the chiefj udge; and, as the chief judge's \n\"designees,\" the two-judge panel had no business concerning itself with this issue. Nonetheless, the \nfocus of the \"opinion\" is entirely upon the companion case question, and the conclusion of the \n12 \n\n... \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 13 of 19    Pg ID 223\n. \n\"opinion\" is  that \"Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases under the provisions of Local Rule \n83.11(b )(7).\" Tel. at S. The reassignment mlc, Local Rule 83.11 (b )(2), is mentioned only in passing, \nsec id. at 2 & n.l, and is completely absent from the two-judge panel's analysis. \nThe court also notes that the document issued by Judges Fcikcns and Cook is void \nbecause it is merely an advisory opinion.  Sec n.l, supra.  While Chief Judge Taylor's Order of \nDisqualification and Transfer reassigned defendants' motion \"for consideration and decision,\" in fact \nthe \"opinion\" docs not make a decision or grant any relief requested in defendants' motion. Rather, \nthe \"opinion\" simply opines that Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases. \nFinally, the court notes that J udgcs Fcikcns and Cook, both at the hearing and in their \n\"opinion,\" completely  ignored  the  matter of my consent  to  any reassignment.  Local Rule \n83.11(b)(2) specifically states that a case may be reassigned \"only with the consent of the Judge to \nwhom the case was originally assigned and with the consent of the Judge to whom it is to be \nreassigned.\" Likewise, Local Rule 83.11 (b )(7)(C) requires reassignment of a companion case only \n\"[w]hcn it becomes apparent to the Judge to whom a case is assigned and to a Judge having an \nearlier case number that two cases arc companion cases.\" At the hearing, plaintiffs counsel properly \nraised this issue, but Judge Fcikcns interrupted him and asserted that consent is an issue only \"in \nnon-companion cases.\" Hearing Transcript, p. 21. Here Judge Fcikcns erred in two ways. First, the \nonly issue addressed to the chief judge was reassignment under Local Rule 83.11(b)(2), which \nspecifically requires consent of both the assignor and assignee judges.  Second, under Local Rule \n83.11 (b )(7)-which concerns the portion of defendants' motion that was never presented to the chief \njudge-reassignment is required only when it is \"apparent to\" the assignor judge that the two cases \nin question arc companions. Ifthe relatedness oft he cases is not apparent to the assignor judge then, \n13 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 14 of 19    Pg ID 224\nr-, \n' •. . \nin effect, he will not consent to the reassignment.  And, for the reasons stated below, it is not at all \napparent to me that Gmttcr and Gratz arc companion cases, notwithstanding the contrary \"opinion\" \nof the hand-picked two-judge panel. \nFor these reasons, the court concludes that Chief Judge Taylor lacked authority to \nrefer defendants' motion, or any portion thereof, to Judges Fcikcns and Cook; and that the August \n6, 1998, \"opinion\" of Judges Fcikcns and Cook is unlawful, void and must be stricken. \nMotion for an Order Designating Cases as Companions Pursuant to Local Rule 83.11 (b)(7)(A)9 \nIn support of their alternate request for designation of the two cases as companions \n9E.D. Mich. LR 83.11(b)(7) states: \n(7) Companion Cases \n(A) Companion cases arc those cases in which it appears that: \n(i) substantially similar evidence will be offered at trial, or \n(ii) the same or related parties arc present, and the cases arise out \nof the same transaction or occurrence.  Cases may be companion \ncases even though one of them may have already been terminated. \n(B) Counsel ... shall be responsible for bringing such cases to the \nattention of the Court by responding to the questions included on \nthe civil cover sheet. \n(C) When it becomes apparent to the Judge to whom a case is \nassigned and to a Judge having an earlier case number that two \ncases arc companion cases, upon consent of the Judge having the \nearlier case number, the Judge shall sign an order reassigning the \ncase to the Judge having the earlier case number. \n14 \n\n.  2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 15 of 19    Pg ID 225\n. \n. \n,. \npursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 83. I I (b )(7)(A), defendants argue that Gratz and Gmttcr \"arc premised \non the  same alleged constitutional and  statutory violations.  The two  lawsuits challenge the \nadmissions process of two units within the University of Michigan.\"  Defendants' Motion, p. 2. \nDefendants also repeat the arguments made in support of the first part of their motion concerning \nthe other alleged similarities between the two cases. While Judges Fcikcns and Cook purport to have \n\"ruled\" that the two cases arc companions, they had no authority to make such a ruling and, as noted \nabove, the court shall strike their \"opinion\" from the record of this case. Thus, the companion case \nissue is still pending and I shall decide it at this time. \nThis court's Local Rule 83.I l(b)(7)(A) defines companion cases as those in which \nit appears that: \n(i) substantially similar evidence will be offered at trial, or \n(ii) the same or related parties arc present, and the cases arise out of \nthe same transaction or occurrence.  Cases may be companion cases \neven though one of them may have already been terminated. \nIt is quite apparent that Gruttcr and Gratz arc not companion cases under either definition. The cases \ndo not have \"the same or related parties.\" The plaintiff in Gmttcr is an applicant to the law school \nwho seeks to represent a class of white applicants who were denied admission to the law school \nduring  the  1995-1998 academic years.  The plaintiffs in  Gratz arc  applicants to  the LS&A \nundergraduate college who seck to represent a class of white applicants who were denied admission \nto that college since I995-1996. The defendants in the two cases arc completely different, the only \noverlap being Lee Bollinger, who was dean of the law school during part of the period at issue in \nGmttcr and is the current president of The University of Michigan.  Other than Bollinger, there is \nno overlap whatsoever in the parties of the two cases. \nI5 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 16 of 19    Pg ID 226\n.  .. \n'  ' \n. \n'...  .. \nNor is it apparent to me that the two cases \"arise out of the same transaction or \noccurrence.\" The \"transaction\" at issue in Gruttcr is the rejection ofplaintiffGruttcr's application \nfor admission to the law school in June 1997.  If a class is certified, the transaction at issue will be \nthe rejection of the law school applications of the class members.  The transaction in Gratz is the \nrejection of the applications of plaintiff Gratz and Hamacher for admission to the undergraduate \ncollege in April 1995 and the spring of 1997, respectively.  If a class is certified in that case, the \ntransaction at issue will be the rejection oft he class members' applications to that institution. While \nthe general legal issue (i.e., the constitutionality of an admissions policy which favors applicants of \ncertain races over others) is the same in both cases, this is not the test under this court's companion \ncase rule. Nor is the test whether the parties in the two cases arc represented by the same attorneys. \nBy the same token, it is not apparent to me that \"substantially similar evidence will \nbe offered at trial\" in the two cases.  One of the attorneys who represents plaintiffs in both cases, \nKirk Kolbo, has submitted an affidavit averring that defendants have produced \"over 5,000 pages \nofd ocuments in the two cases .... I do not believe that any documents produced or identified in one \ncase were also produced or identified in the other case.\"  Kolbo Affidavit, ,I 8.  Mr. Kolbo also \nindicates that the defendants in Gratz have identified 20 individuals who arc primarily responsible \nfor admissions policies and the usc of racial preferences at the undergraduate college, and that the \ndefendants in Grutteridcntificd 22 individuals who arc primarily responsible for admissions policies \nand the usc ofr acial preferences at the law school. There is no overlap between the two groups. Sec \nPlaintifrs Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Reassignment or Designation as Companion \nCases, pp. 2-3.  The reason for the lack of any overlap apparently is due to the simple fact that the \nlaw school and the undergraduate college operate as independent units within The University of \n16 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 42   Filed 08/17/98   Pg 17 of 19    Pg ID 227\n'  -\nMichigan, and it appears their admissions policies have little, if anything, to do with one another. \nFor all of these reasons, it is quite apparent to me that the Gratz and Gmtter cases arc \nnot companions under B.D. Mich. LR 83.11 (b )(7)(A). Accordingly, there is no occasion for me to \nreassign this matter to Judge Duggan. \nAdditionally, the court would note that the timing of defendants' motion further \ncounsels against reassignment. As noted above, the complaint in Grutter was filed on December 3, \n1997. The instant motion was not filed until July 15, 1998 --more than seven months later. I raised \nthe companion case issue at two conferences with counsel, and no one seriously argued on either of \nthose occasions that I should consider reassigning the case to Judge Duggan.  Nor did either party \nfile a motion or take any other action seeking reassignment- until now, more than seven months \nafter the filing of the complaint in Gmtter. \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, \nIT IS ORDERED that the August 6, 1998, \"opinion\" of Judges Feikens and Cook is \nstricken from the docket in Gmttcr v. Bollinger, 97-75928. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion pursuant to B.D. Mich.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities\nof citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; \nnor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n \n3  42 U.S.C. § 2000d states: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.” \n \n4  These groups are United For Equality and Affirmative Action (UEAA), the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means \nNecessary (BAMN), and Law Students for Affirmative Action (LSAA). \n \n5  For easy reference a copy of this grid, which shows admissions information for 1991, is attached to this opinion as Exhibit A. \n \n6  For example, in 1991 there were 499 applicants with an LSAT score between 38 and 41 and a UGPA between 3.50 and 3.74; and \nof these, 36 were offered admission. In later years, the LSAT was scored on a scale between 120 and 180 points. The grids for the \nyears at issue in this case (1995 to the present) still show UGPA in quarter-point increments on the vertical axis, as was done in \nearlier years. But the LSAT scores, which are still shown along the horizontal axis, are presented in the following increments: no \nLSAT, 120–145, 146–147, 148–150, 151–153, 154–155, 156–158, 159–160, 161–163, 164–166, 167–169, and 170–above. \n \n7  The identical statement appears at page 81 of the law school bulletin for 1995–1997. See Trial Exhibit 7. \n \n8  Trial Exhibit 53 is a document entitled “The History of Special Admissions at the University of Michigan Law School, \n1966–1981.” This document traces the history of the law school’s efforts to enroll a certain percentage of students from particular, \nidentified minority groups during this time period. Beginning in 1966, the law school faculty became concerned about the low \nnumbers of black students. For the first time, “those who are Negroes or from disadvantaged backgrounds” who were on the \nwaiting list for admission were given preference. Id. at 5. In 1970, the dean of admissions indicated he would seek to admit black \nand Mexican–American students “who fall below the admission standards regularly applied” in sufficient numbers to constitute \n10% of the entering class. Id. at 16. Exhibit 53 shows that from the late 1960s to the early 1980s the law school faculty frequently \ndebated the issue of special admissions—the reasons for the policy, how it should be administered, the minority groups to which it \nwas directed, and the “target” percentage the law school should aim to achieve. Over the years, the law school faculty apparently \nreached a consensus that black and Hispanic students should constitute between 10% and 12.5% of the entering class. See id. at 16, \n19, 22, 27, 31, 34, 45, 48–50, 57. In 1975 the law school faculty formally adopted a special admissions policy that identified \n“Blacks,  Chicanos,  American  Indians,  and  Puerto  Rican  Americans”  as  the  groups  which  “have  been  substantially \nunderrepresented in the student body and the legal profession” and directed that members from these groups constitute 10–12% of \nthe entering class. See id. at 48–49. The dean of the law school, Terrance Sandalow, reaffirmed the 10–12% goal in a memorandum \nto the faulty in 1978. See id. at 53–55. \n \n9  In 1989, regular admissions had a median LSAT score of 43 and a median UGPA of 3.60, while special admissions had a median \nLSAT score of 35 and a median UGPA of 3.06. In 1990, regular admissions had a median LSAT score of 45 and a median UGPA \nof 3.60, while special admissions had a median LSAT score of 38 and a median UGPA of 3.16. \n \n10  Mr. Shields also acknowledged that, at his deposition, he testified that race “generally” explains the difference in admissions rates \nbetween minority and non-minority groups. The comparison during Mr. Shields’ cross-examination was the difference in \nadmission rates between white and black applicants with LSAT scores between 154 and 169 and with UGPA’s between 3.25 and \n4.00. In these cells nearly all of the African American applicants (48 of 52) were accepted, whereas a much smaller percentage of \nthe Caucasian applicants (379 of 1437) were accepted. In the same cluster of cells, 30 of 40 Mexican American applicants were\naccepted; 7 of 14 Native American applicants were accepted; and 3 of 5 Puerto Rican applicants were accepted. \n \n \n\n11  See, e.g., Exhibit 112 (1988–1989), Exhibit 113 (1989–1990), Exhibit 114 (1990–1991), Exhibit 115 (1992), Exhibit 116 (1993). \nExhibit 14 shows that in the 1994 entering class, white students had a median LSAT score of 168 and a median UGPA of 3.57, \nwhile the corresponding figures were 157 and 2.97 for African American students, and 162 and 3.26 for Mexican American \nstudents. In the 1995 entering class, white students had a median LSAT score of 167 and a median UGPA of 3.59, while the \ncorresponding figures were 155 and 3.18 for African American students, and 159 and 3.35 for Mexican American students. \n \n12  It was this committee’s report and recommendation that became the law school’s official admissions policy when it was adopted, \nunanimously, by the law faculty in April 1992. See Exhibit 4 (cover sheet). \n \n13  Dean Lehman conceded that the different admission rates for different racial groups is “partly indicative” of the extent to which \nrace is considered. Referring to Ex. 15 (the law school’s 1995 grids), Dean Lehman acknowledged that all African American \napplicants with an LSAT score of 159–160 and a UGPA of 3.00 and above were admitted, whereas only one of 54 Asian applicants \nand four of 190 Caucasian applicants with these qualifications were admitted. \n \n14  The other members of the committee were Don Herzog, Jeffrey Lehman, Don Regan, Ted Shaw and Dennis Shields. See Exhibit 4, \np. 14. \n \n15  Professor Lempert indicated that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have also been discriminated against, but they were not \nmentioned in the law school’s admissions policy because members of these groups are already being admitted to the law school in \nsignificant numbers. \n \n16  Dr. Larntz’ expert reports were admitted as Exhibits 137–142. Exhibit 143 consists of the tables and charts of Dr. Larntz’ \n“powerpoint presentation.” \n \n17  Dr. Raudenbush’s expert reports were admitted as Exhibits 145–150. \n \n18  The law school grids also indicate the “yield,” that is, the number of admittees who enrolled. \n \n19  For example, separate grids are compiled for Native Americans, African Americans, Caucasian Americans, Mexican Americans, \nHispanic Americans, Asian/Pacific Island Americans, Puerto Rican Applicants, and for other groups as well. \n \n20  In 1995, the relative odds of acceptance were 61.37 for Native Americans, 257.93 for African Americans, 81.90 for Mexican \nAmericans, and 37.86 for Puerto Ricans. In 1996, the relative odds were 29.81 for Native Americans, 313.59 for African \nAmericans, 81.46 for Mexican Americans, and 45.40 for Puerto Ricans. In 1997, the relative odds were 37.37 for Native \nAmericans, 53.49 for African Americans, 17.55 for Mexican Americans, and 32.78 for Puerto Ricans. In 1998, the relative odds \nwere 23.98 for Native Americans, 132.16 for African Americans, 23.53 for Mexican Americans, and 17.84 for Puerto Ricans. See\nExhibit 137, pp. 23–26. In 1999, the relative odds were 32.05 for Native Americans, 206.45 for African Americans, 43.77 for \nMexican Americans, and 41.71 for Puerto Ricans. See Exhibit 139, p. 21. And in 2000, the relative odds were 24.61 for Native \nAmericans, 443.26 for African Americans, 16.99 for Mexican Americans, and 28.63 for Puerto Ricans. \nDr. Larntz cautioned that the relative odds do not express the “number of times greater” a minority applicant’s chances of \nadmission are as compared to those of a Caucasian applicant. For the 1995 relative odds, for example, if a Caucasian applicant \nhas a 6–7% chance of being admitted, an African American with a similar index score would have a 93% chance of being \nadmitted. If a Caucasian applicant has a 10% chance of being admitted, a Mexican American applicant with a similar index \nscore would have a 90% chance of being admitted. \n \n21  See Exhibit 137, Figures 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 38; Exhibit 139, Figures 3, 4, 5, 8; Exhibit 141, \nFigures 3, 4, 5, 8. \n \n22  Dr. Larntz testified that he disregarded these cells because they do not contain “comparative information.” That is, if all applicants \nin a particular cell are accepted, or if all are rejected, then there is no basis for calculating the odds ratio. \n \n23  Professor Lempert has written that the law school has considered applicants’ race since 1966. See Exhibit 166, p. 2. \n \n24  This is the reason stated in the policy itself, and it is the reason given by defendants’ witnesses and counsel. However, the court \nnotes that as recently as 1996–1997 the law school’s bulletin indicated that one reason for the affirmative action policy has been to \nfurther “the public interest in increasing the number of lawyers from groups which the faculty identifies as significantly \nunderrepresented in the legal profession.” Exhibit 6, p. 81. \n \n25  The percentages range from a low of 5.8% in 1974 to a high of 12.5% in 1977, but the mean percentage of underrepresented \nminority students from 1973 to 1985 was 9.7%. \n \n26  The percentages range from a low of 5.4% in 1998 to a high of 19.2% in 1994, but the mean percentage of underrepresented \n \n\nminority students from 1986 to 1999 was 12.6%. \n \n27  From the graduation years 1986 to 1999, underrepresented minorities constituted at least 9.8% (1999) and as much as 19.2% \n(1994) of the class, except in 1998 when the percentage dipped to 5.4%. See Exhibit 97. \n \n28  While plaintiffs claim that the law school’s policy violates both the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, the legal analysis under the two claims is the same. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 287, 98 S.Ct. 2733; Johnson v. \nBoard of Regents, 106 F.Supp.2d 1362, 1366 (S.D.Ga.2000). \n \n29  Justice Powell found U.C. Davis’ special admissions program invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at \n320, 98 S.Ct. 2733; while the Stevens group avoided the constitutional issue and found that the program violated Title VI, see id. at \n421, 98 S.Ct. 2733. \n \n30  The difficulty of this task was perhaps best summarized by the Fifth Circuit in United States v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1337 \n(5th Cir.1980), which stated: “We frankly admit that we are not entirely sure what to make of the various Bakke opinions. In over \none hundred and fifty pages of United States Reports, the Justices have told us mainly that they have agreed to disagree.” \n \n31  See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). \n \n32  U.C. Davis argued that its special admissions program served four purposes: “(i) reducing the historic deficit of traditionally \ndisfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession; (ii) countering the effects of societal discrimination; (iii)\nincreasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational \nbenefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student body.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 306, 98 S.Ct. 2733. \n \n33  The Brennan group stated that it “join[ed] Parts I and V–C of our Brother POWELL’s opinion and three of us agree with his \nconclusion in Part II that this case does not require us to resolve the question whether there is a private right of action under Title \nVI.” 438 U.S. at 328, 98 S.Ct. 2733. \n \n34  The court acknowledges that the status of Justice Powell’s opinion has been the subject of much debate and disagreement. Some\ncourts have concluded that the diversity rationale is part of Bakke ‘s holding. See, e.g., Smith v. University of Wash. Law Sch., 233 \nF.3d 1188, 1200–1201 (9th Cir.2000); Gratz v. Bollinger, 122 F.Supp.2d 811, 819–21 (E.D.Mich.2000). Others have reached the \nopposite conclusion. See, e.g., Hopwood v. State of Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 944–45 (5th Cir.1996); Johnson v. Board of Regents of the \nUniv. Sys. of Georgia, 106 F.Supp.2d 1362, 1368–69 (S.D.Ga.2000). Other courts have avoided deciding the issue. See, e.g., \nEisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Sch., 197 F.3d 123, 130 (4th Cir.1999) (“whether diversity is a compelling governmental \ninterest remains unresolved, and in this case, we also choose to leave it unresolved”); Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 796 (1st \nCir.1998) ( “we need not definitively resolve this conundrum today”). \n \n35  This statement appears in Part III–A of Justice O’Connor’s opinion, in which Justices Rehnquist, White and Kennedy joined. \nJustice Scalia, in a concurring opinion, wrote that “[a]t least where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to \nthe level of imminent danger to life and limb ... can justify an exception to the principle embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment \nthat ‘[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.’ ” 488 U.S. at 521, 109 S.Ct. 706\n(citations omitted). Thus, four members of the Court expressed the view that racial classifications are permissible only to remedy \npast discrimination, and a fifth expressed the view that they are permissible only in cases of social emergency. \n \n36  For example, race-based hiring or promotion programs have been upheld where necessary to correct a racial imbalance caused by \ndocumented race discrimination by a particular agency or employer. See, e.g., United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 107 S.Ct. \n1053, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987); Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976). Race-based \nstudent assignments have been upheld where necessary to correct a racial imbalance, or a misallocation of school resources, caused \nby de jure racial segregation. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971). \n \n37  Professor Syverud’s report is among those contained in volume 3 of the appendix filed by defendants in support of their renewed \nmotion for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity. \n \n38  Professor Terrance Sandalow, former dean of the law school and long-time law professor, has written in this connection: \nStudents learn from one another in different ways. In the course of discussion, whether in the classroom or in dormitory ‘bull \nsessions,’ participants are likely to be exposed to unfamiliar ideas. My own experience and that of colleagues with whom I \nhave discussed the question, experience that concededly is limited to the classroom setting, is that racial diversity is not \nresponsible for generating ideas unfamiliar to some members of the class. Students do, of course, quite frequently express and \ndevelop ideas that others in the class have not previously encountered, but even though the subjects I teach deal extensively \nwith racial issues, I cannot recall an instance in which, for example, ideas were expressed by a black student that have not also \nbeen expressed by white students. Black students do, at times, call attention to the racial implications of issues that are not \n \n\nfacially concemed with race, but white and Asian–American students are in my experience no less likely to do so. \nTerrance Sandalow, “Identity and Equality, Minority Preferences Reconsidered,” 97 Mich. L.Rev. 1874, 1906–1907 (1999). \n \n39  In this connection it is worth noting that the law school, like U.C. Davis, “does not purport to have made, and is in no position to \nmake such findings. Its broad mission is education, not the formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of particular \nclaims of illegality.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 309, 98 S.Ct. 2733. \n \n40  See the University of Michigan Law School Bulletin, 1996–1997 (Exhibit 6), p. 81; the University of Michigan Law School \nBulletin, 1995–1997 (Exhibit 7), p. 81. No such statement appears in the University of Michigan Law School Bulletin, 1997–1999 \n(Exhibit 8), p. 85. \n \n41  A close fit is lacking for another reason—namely, that there is no basis for believing that a particular member of any \nunderrepresented minority group is “particularly likely to have experiences and perspectives of special importance to our mission.”\nExhibit 4, 1992 Admissions Policy, p. 12. One cannot assume, for example, that a particular African American applicant has been \nthe victim of race discrimination or that a particular Mexican American applicant has grown up in an economically depressed \nneighborhood. \n \n42  Winston Churchill, in a radio broadcast in October 1939. J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 620 (1968). \n \n43  Of course, whether plaintiffs actually should be awarded any damages is a question to be resolved in the next phase of the trial. \nNow that defendants’ liability has been established, defendants may still defeat plaintiffs’ claim for compensatory damages by \nshowing that plaintiffs would not have been admitted under a race-blind admissions policy. See Hopwood, 78 F.3d at 955–57\n(discussing burden of proof under Mt. Healthy ). \n \n44  In this connection Professor Orfield meant racial separation, not de jure segregation. \n \n45  The percentage of African American students increased to 1.8% (nine students) in 1998 but fell slightly to 1.7% (nine students) in \n1999. \n \n46  The percentage of Native American students increased to 1.0% (five students) in 1998 but fell to 0.4% (two students) in 1999. \n \n47  The percentage of Hispanic students increased to 7.6% (37 students) in 1998 and to 8.1% (42 students) in 1999. \n \n48  By this Professor Orfield was referring to the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Davis, and the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles. \n \n49  Professor Orfield has written: \nThe reversal of affirmative admissions in higher education can drastically reduce black, Latino, and American Indian \nenrollment on highly selective campuses. The increased use of tests and grades as entrance standards will tend to exacerbate \nthe existing inequities in U.S. society. If affirmative action is outlawed nationally, as it has been in Texas, the impact on\naccess to leading public and private universities would be enormous. Many of our most able students would find themselves \non campuses overwhelmingly dominated by white and Asian students. The severe isolation characteristic of our more affluent \nsuburbs would become the rule in the institutions that train the leaders of our society and our professions. This threatens \ncritical educational functions of universities and their ability to fully serve their communities. \nExhibit 167D, G. Orfield and E. Miller, Chilling Admissions 14 (1998). \n \n50  Additional testimony about this history of racial discrimination in the United States was provided by Dr. Eric Foner, a professor of \nAmerican history at Columbia University. \n \n51  The University of California has campuses at Los Angeles, Berkeley, San Diego, Irvine, Davis, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and \nRiverside. \n \n52  Exhibit 214 shows applications, admissions, admissions rates, and enrollment figures for the years 1995 to 2000 at all of the \nUniversity of California campuses by the race of the applicants. It appears that the most significant declines in admission rates \noccurred among African Americans, Native Americans, Chicanos and Latinos at Berkeley, Los Angeles and San Diego. The court \nnotes that admission rates of whites and Asian Americans also dropped at most of the campuses over the same time period, albeit \nless dramatically. At San Diego, for example, the admission rate for Asian Americans fell from 62.8% in 1995 to 46.1% in 2000. \nAt Santa Barbara, the admission rate for whites fell from 85.3% in 1995 to 48.9% in 2000. \n \n53  Professor Lempert found that the law school’s “admissions index” (combination of LSAT score and UGPA) was an equally poor \npredictor of career success for both minority and white alumni. See Exhibit 166, pp. 94–99 (Tables 29A, 29B, 29C, 30A, 30B, \n30C). \n \n\n \n54  While not introduced at trial, defendants did submit a report from Dr. Thomas Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, in support of their motion for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity. Professor Sugrue \ncites census data showing the significant disparities along racial lines in educational attainment, unemployment rates, income \nlevels, poverty rates, and household net worth. See Sugrue Report, pp. 50, 53–57. \n \n55  The median undergraduate GPA for accepted applicants, by race, is shown in Exhibit 137, p. 21; Exhibit 139, p. 19; and Exhibit \n141, p. 16. The smallest difference between the Caucasian UGPA and an underrepresented minority group UGPA was .05 \n(Caucasian vs. Puerto Rican in 1996, and Caucasian vs. Native American in 1998). The largest difference was .41 (Caucasian vs. \nAfrican American in 2000). Averaging the figures over the six years, one sees that the gap between the Caucasian UGPA was .21\nfor Native Americans, .32 for African Americans, .14 for Mexican Americans, and .22 for Puerto Ricans. \n \n56  The median LSAT scores for accepted applicants, by race, is shown in Exhibit 137, p.22; Exhibit 139, p. 20; and Exhibit 141, p. \n17. The smallest difference between the Caucasian LSAT score and an underrepresented minority group LSAT score was three \npoints (Caucasian vs. Native American in 2000). The largest different was 12 points (Caucasian vs. African American in 2000). \nAveraging the figures over the six years, one sees that the point gap between the Caucasian LSAT score was 6.8 for Native \nAmericans, 9.6 for African Americans, 7 for Mexican Americans, and 7.6 for Puerto Ricans. \n \n57  All 47 of these students were African American or Hispanic. No Native Americans participated in the focus groups. See Exhibit \n157, Figure 2. \n \n58  At trial Professor Allen indicated that focus groups 1, 2, 5, 8, 9 and 11 were conducted at The University of Michigan; focus\ngroups 4, 6 and 10 were conducted at Berkeley; focus groups 3 and 7 were conducted at Harvard; and focus group 12 was \nconducted at Michigan State University. \n \n59  The magnitude of this flaw is suggested by Exhibit 18, which identifies all of the undergraduate schools which graduated students \nwho entered the law school’s 1995 class. Of the 337 students in that class, only 85(25%) came from the four “feeder” institutions \nstudied by Professor Allen. The remaining 252 students (75%) came from 106 other colleges and universities which were not \nincluded in the study. \n \n60  This statement is from Part I of Justice Powell’s opinion, which was joined by Justices Burger and Rehnquist. Justice O’Connor \nfiled a concurring opinion in which she specifically joined Part I of Justice Powell’s opinion, see 476 U.S. at 294, 106 S.Ct. 1842\nand “agree[d] with the plurality that a governmental agency’s interest in remedying ‘societal’ discrimination, that is, discrimination \nnot traceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster under strict scrutiny.” 476 \nU.S. at 288, 106 S.Ct. 1842. Justice White also concurred in the judgment and wrote that “[n]one of the interests asserted by the \nBoard, singly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy and save it from the strictures of the Equal Protection \nClause.” 476 U.S. at 295, 106 S.Ct. 1842. Thus, five members of the court indicated that the Fourteenth Amendment does not \npermit government to make racial classifications in order to remedy societal discrimination. \n \n61  This statement is from Part III–A of Justice Powell’s opinion, in which Justices Burger, Rehnquist and O’Connor joined. Justice \nWhite, in a concurring opinion, tacitly agreed with the statement by indicating that “[n]one of the interests asserted by the Board, \nsingly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy and save it from the structures of the Equal Protection Clause.”\n476 U.S. at 295, 106 S.Ct. 1842. \n \n62  This is not a case where a challenge to a desegregation order is opposed on the grounds that the order must be kept in place lest the \nschool district revert to a racially segregated state. See, e.g., Belk v. Charlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 233 F.3d 232 (4th \nCir.2000) (opinion vacated). Nor, with all due respect to the intervenors’ counsel, can the present admissions policy be defended \non the grounds that its elimination would result in the creation of an all-white campus. In this connection the intervenors have \nraised the specter of Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950), in which the Supreme Court struck down \nthe de jure exclusion of blacks from the University of Texas Law School and the creation of a separate law school for black \nstudents. There is simply no comparison between the de jure segregation at issue in Sweatt and a race-blind admissions policy \nwhich may admit fewer underrepresented minority students than are admitted by a race-conscious policy. \n \n63  The court did not hear any testimony as to whether the University of Michigan Law School has considered reducing its reliance on \nthe LSAT or whether it has considered challenging the ABA’s requirement that applicants take “an acceptable test.” \n \n64  The court notes again that no party in this case has alleged, or offered any evidence to suggest, that the law school or the University \nof Michigan has committed any acts of discrimination against any minority group which might warrant a race-based remedy. \n \n \n\n \n ",

Therefore, it appears that between 294 and 444 offers must still be made. The court’s injunction does not require \nthe law school to rescind any offers it has already extended. \n \n2  Defendants’ alternative request for a 10–day “administrative stay” is also denied. Defendants seek this alternative relief “to permit \nDefendants an opportunity to file their notice of appeal and seek a stay from the Court of Appeals.” Defendants’ Mem. of Law in \nSupport of Motion to Stay Injunction, p. 2. Defendants are free at any time to apply to the court of appeals for a stay of this court’s \ninjunction. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(g). Indeed, defendants state in their brief that they intended to file a notice of appeal on April 2, \n2001, and to seek a stay from the court of appeals if this court did not grant one by that date. Thus, it does not appear that any \npurpose would be served by a 10–day stay. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n ",

This  Court  has  jurisdiction of  the  action  under  28 \nu.s.c. \n§§  1331  and  1343.  This  action arises  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States Constitution,  and \nunder  federal  laws,  42  U.S.C.  §§  1981,  1983,  and  2000d  et \n3.  Venue  in  this  Court  is proper  under  28  U.S.C. \n§  1391  and  this  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction over  the \ndefendants  in  this  matter because  the  events  giving  rise  to \nthis  claim  occurred,  and will  occur,  in  this  district. \nPlaintiff \n4.  Barbara  Grutter  is,  and  at all  times  relevant  to \nthis  litigation was,  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Michigan. \nShe  applied  in  1996  for  admission  to  the  University  of \nMichigan  Law  School  (the  \"Law  School\")  in  the  academic  year \n1997-98.  After being placed on  a  \"wait  list,\"  she  was \napprised by  the  Law  School,  by  a  letter dated June  25,  1997, \nthat  her  application had  been  rejected.

The  Regents  of  University  of  Michigan  (\"the \nUniversity\")  is  the  governing  body  of  the  University of \nMichigan,  a  public  educational  institution  in  the  State of \nMichigan.  The  University  of Michigan  Law  School  (\"Law \nSchool\")  is  a  school  under  the  supervisory authority of  the \nUniversity. \n6.  On  or around  February  1,  1997,  Lee  Bollinger \nbecame  the  President  of  the  University.  Prior  to  that  time \nhe  was  Dean  of  the  Law  School,  and  was  responsible  for  the \ninitial  implementation  of  the  admissions  policies  that were \nused  at  least  from  1995  until  the  present  and which  led  to \nplaintiff being  treated unequally.

He  is being \nsued  in  his  individual  and  official  capacities. \n8.  Dennis  Shields  is  the  Dean  of  Admissions  at  the \nLaw  School  and  was  responsible  for  the  admissions  policies \nthat were  used at  least  from  1995  until  the  present  and \nwhich  led  to  plaintiff being  treated unequally.  He  is being \nsued  in his  individual  and  official capacities. \n9.  Unless  enjoined,  defendants  will  continue  to \napprove  of,  and  implement,  an  admissions  system  for  the  Law \nSchool  substantially the  same  as  the  system described below. \nClass  Action  Allegations \n10.  Plaintiff brings  this  action as  a  class  action \npursuant  to  Rules  23(a),  23(b),  and  23(c) (4) (A)  of  the \nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  on  behalf  of  a  class \nconsisting  of  all  students  who: \na.  applied  for  and were  not  granted  admission  to  the \nLaw  School  for  all academic  years  since  1995-98 \nthrough  the  entry of  a  judgment  in  this  action  or \nare  ready and  able  to  apply  to  the  Law  School;  and \n4 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 5 of 12    Pg ID 5\n. \n.  ,--. .  ....._ \n..  ,,  ; \n~  ~  '.-' \nb.  are  members  of  those  racial  or  ethnic  groups, \nincluding Caucasian,  that  defendants  have  treated \nless  favorably  in considering  their applications \nfor  admission  to  the  Law  School. \n11.  Plaintiff  seeks  to maintain  this  class,  pursuant \nto  Rules  23(b)  and  23(c) (4),  on  the  issues  of  whether \ndefendants  engaged  in unlawful  discrimination and whether \ndefendants  should be  enjoined  from  continuing  their \ndiscriminatory policies. \n12.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  its \nmembers  is  impracticable.  Defendants  receive  thousands  of \napplications  for  admission  each year  for  the  Law  School  and \nwill  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Plaintiff does  not \nknow  addresses  or  the  precise number  of  rejected applicants, \nbut  can  ascertain  this  information  from  the  defendants' \nrecords. \n13.  Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  exist  as  to  all \nmembers  of  the  class  and  predominate  over  any  questions \nsolely affecting  iadividual  members  of  the  class.  Among  the \nquestions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  class  is whether \ndefendants  violated  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United \n5 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 6 of 12    Pg ID 6\n·-\n' . \nStates  Constitution,  and  federal  laws,  42  U.S.C.  §§  1981, \n1983,  and  2000d  et  seq.,  by discriminating  and  by  conspiring \nto  discriminate  against  certain applicants  on  the  basis  of \nrace,  and whether  they will  continue  to  do  so. \n14.  Plaintiff's claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of \nthe members  of  the  class  and  she  is an  adequate \nrepresentative  of  the  class.  Plaintiff  and members  of  the \nclass  have  sustained damages,  or will  sustain damages  in  the \nfuture  if defendants'  policies  are  not  enjoined,  because  of \ndefendants'  unlawful  activities  alleged herein.  Plaintiff \nhas  retained counsel  competent  and  experienced  in race \ndiscrimination  litigation and  intends  to  prosecute  this \naction vigorously.  Plaintiff will  fairly  and  adequately \nprotect  the  interests  of  the  class. \n15.  A class  action  is  superior  to  other  available \nmeans  for  the  fair  and  efficient adjudication  of  the \ncontroversy. \nFacts \n16.  The  University  is  a  State-run university which \nalso  receives  federal  funds.  The  Law  School  is  an \n6 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 7 of 12    Pg ID 7\n.. \neducational  unit  part of,  operated by,  and  responsible  to, \nthe  University.  It also  receives  federal  funds. \n17.  The  Law  School  Admissions  form  asks  each  applicant \nto  disclose  his  or her  race. \n18.  Plaintiff  identified her  race  by  checking  the  box \nnext  to  \"white.\" \n19.  Defendants  used  the  race  information provided by \nplaintiff and  other applicants  to  determine  who  would  be \nadmitted  to  the  Law  School. \n20.  Defendants  used  different  admissions  standards \nbased  on  each  student's  self-identified race.  As  a  result, \nstudents  from  favored  racial  groups  had  a  significantly \ngreater  chance  of  admission  than  students  with  similar \ncredentials  from  disfavored  racial  groups. \n21.  Applicants  from  disfavored  racial  groups  were  not \ncompared  directly  to  applicants  from  favored  racial  groups. \n22.  Plaintiff,  categorized as  white,  was  not  in one  of \nthe  favored  racial  groups  that  benefitted  from  less \nstringent admissions  standards. \n7 \n\n-----------\n··-----· \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 8 of 12    Pg ID 8\n... \n• \n• \n,,. ,. , 1 \n23.  Defendants  did not merely  use  race  as  a  \"plus\" \nfactor  or as  one  of  many  factors  to  attain a  diverse  student \nbody.  Rather,  race was  one  of  the  predominant  factors \n(along  with  scores  on  the  Law  School  Admissions  Test  and \nundergraduate  grade  point  averages)  used  for  determining \nadmission. \n24.  Defendants  had  no  compelling  interest  to  justify \ntheir use  of  race  in  the  admissions  process,  and  were  not \nmotivated by  either an  interest  in  educational  diversity or \nby  a  desire  to  remedy  the present  effects  of  any  past \ndiscrimination. \n25.  Assuming  arguendo  that  defendants  had  a  compelling \ninterest  for  which  they  used  race  in  their admissions \ncriteria,  defendants  did not  consider,  and  never  employed, \nany  race  neutral  alternative  to  achieve  that  interest. \n26.  As  a  result  of  defendants'  racially discriminatory \nprocedures  and  practices,  plaintiff's  application was \nrejected.  Plaintiff  suffered humiliation,  emotional \ndistress,  and  pain  and  suffering as  a  consequence  of  her \napplication being  rejected.  She  also  suffered humiliation, \nemotional  distress,  and  pain and  suffering upon  learning \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 9 of 12    Pg ID 9\n-\n. \n. \n.  .,,_, \n~  '  '  ' \nthat  defendants  had  discriminated against  her  on  the  basis \nof  her  race. \n27.  As  a  result  of  defendants'  discrimination, \nplaintiff has  never  attended  law  school,  and  has  suffered \neconomic  damages  resulting  from  her  inability to proceed \nwith her  planned  career as  a  lawyer.  Plaintiff  still \ndesires  to  attend  the  Law  School,  and  to  become  a \nlawy~r. \n28.  If  not  enjoined,  defendants  will  continue  to  use \nrace  in selecting students  for  the  Law  School. \nFIRST  CLAIM \n29.

Lehman  and  Shield acted under  culor  of \nlaw  in  implementing  the  policy  in 1997  that  led  the  Law \nSchool  to  deny  plaintiff equal  protection of  the  laws,  and \n9 \n\n.  2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 1   Filed 12/03/97   Pg 10 of 12    Pg ID 10\n-\n.. \n~ \nto  discriminate  against  her  on  the  basis  of  race,  in \nu.s.c. \nviolation  of  42  §§  1981  and  1983. \n31.

Plaintiff has filed a \nresponse brief, defendants have filed a reply, and the court has heard oral argument. \nI. Introduction \nPlaintiff Barbara Grutter alleges that she is white and that in 1996 she applied for \nadmission to The University of Michigan Law School. At first she was placed on a waiting list, but \nin June 1997 her application was rejected. Plaintiff alleges that her application was rejected because \nthe law school uses race as a \"predominant\" factor, giving minority applicants \"a significantly greater \n\n-------\n·----·------ .. \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 2 of 10    Pg ID 539\nchance  of admission  than  students  with  similar credentials  from  disfavored  racial  groups.\" \nComplaint, ~,[20, 23.  In their answer to the complaint, defendants \"state that they do have a current \nintention to continue using race as a factor in admissions, as part of a broad array of qualifications \nand characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important clement.\" \nAnswer,,[~ 9, 23. \nPlaintiff asserts two claims.  First, she claims that defendants discriminated against \nher on the basis of her race, thereby violating her rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. This claim is brought undcr42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. Second, plaintiff claims that \ndefendants violated a federal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, which prohibits recipients of federal funds \nfrom discriminating on the basis of race.  For relief, plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment to the \neffect that her rights were violated; an injunction prohibiting racial discrimination in admissions; \ncompensatory and punitive damages; an order requiring defendants to admit her to the law school; \nand attorney fees and costs. \nIn an opinion and order dated January 7, 1999, the court granted plaintiffs motion \nfor class certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and damages phases.  In that \nopinion, the court concluded that class certification is appropriate in this matter under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b)(l )(A) and 23(b) (2), but not under Rule 23(b) (I )(B). The court also determined that the trial \nshould be bifurcated. In the liability phase, the court intends to rule on the lawfulness of defendants' \nadmission policy. Ift he policy is found to be unlawful, damages would be determined in the second \nphase of the trial. \n2 \n\n------------· \n.  ---------------~-----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 3 of 10    Pg ID 540\nII. Defendants' Motion for Relief from Order \nDefendants'  motion  is  entitled  \"motion  for  relief from  order regarding  class \ncertification and bifurcation in  light of subsequent authority.\"  It is essentially a motion for \nreconsideration of the January 7, 1999, opinion.  Defendants argue that the court's rulings on class \ncertification and bifurcation arc erroneous in light of two recent Supreme Court decisions:  Texas \nv. LeSage, 120 S. Ct. 467 (1999), and Ortiz v. Bibrcboard, 119 S. Ct. 2295 (1999).  In response, \nplaintiff argues that these cases do not represent a change in the law and that the court should not \nchange its earlier rulings. \nA. Bifurcation \nDefendants first argue that the January 7, 1999, opinion erred in its statement that \n\"[a] ny applicant who was rejected under an unconstitutional admissions policy has a cause ofa ction, \nat least for nominal damages.\" Defendants argued previously that this case should not be certified \nas a class action until after plaintiffGruttcr proves, in the liability phase of the trial, that she would \nhave been admitted under a race-neutral admissions policy. The court rejected this argument on the \ngrounds that a rejected applicant is entitled to at least nominal damages, regardless of whether he \nwould also have been rejected under a race-neutral policy.  That is, the court concluded that \ndefendants' liability would be established if it is determined that the present admissions policy is \nunlawful.  If a particular applicant would have been rejected even under a race-neutral policy, this \nfact  would  be  relevant in  assessing compensatory  damages,  but it would not be  relevant  in \ndetermining liability. \nDefendants argue that a different ruling on this question is required by the Supreme \n3 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 4 of 10    Pg ID 541\nCourt's decision in Texas v. Lesage, 120 S. Ct. 467 (1999).  In that case, plaintiff Francois Lesage, \nwho is white, applied to the Ph.D. program in psychology at the University of Texas.  When his \napplication was rejected, he sued on the grounds that the university gave preferential consideration \nto minority applicants.  The university moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff's \napplication was so weak that he would not have been admitted under any circumstances. The district \ncourt granted the motion because any consideration of race was irrelevant in plaintiff's case, since \nthe evidence showed that all of the admitted students had superior academic qualifications. \nThe Fifth Circuit reversed on the grounds that \"[a]n applicant who was rejected at a \nstage of the review process that was race conscious ... has 'suffered an implied injury' - the \ninability  to compete on an equal footing.\"  120 S. Ct. at 468, quoting !58 F.3d 213,222 (5'11  Cir. \n1998). The court of appeals remanded the case because a factual dispute existed \"as to whether the \nstage ofr eview during which Lesage's application was eliminated was in some way race conscious.\" \nThe Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals, stating: \nUnder Mt. Healthy City Bd. ofEd. v. Doyle, even if the government \nhas  considered an  impermissible criterion  in  making  a decision \nadverse  to  the  plaintiff,  it  can  nonetheless  defeat  liability  by \ndemonstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the \nforbidden consideration.  Our previous decisions on this point have \ntypically involved alleged retaliation for protected First Amendment \nactivity  rather than  racial  discrimination,  but that distinction  is \nimmaterial.  The underlying principle is the same: The government \ncan avoid liability by proving that it would have made the same \ndecision without the impermissible motive. \nSimply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental \ndecision as  being  based on an  impermissible criterion and  it  is \nundisputed that the government would have made the same decision \nregardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under § \n1983. \n4 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 5 of 10    Pg ID 542\nTd. (citations omitted).  Defendants point to this portion of the Lesage opinion and argue that they \nshould be permitted to show, in the liability phase of the trial, that plaintiffGruttcr would not have \nbeen admitted even if her race had not been considered.  Defendants contend that if they can prove \nthis, then there is no basis for proceeding to the damages phase of the trial, since they will have \nprevailed on the issue of liability. Defendants believe Lesage undercuts the statement in the court's \nJanuary 1999 opinion that all applicants would be entitled to at least nominal damages, due merely \nto the fact that their race was considered in rejecting their applications, if defendants' admissions \npolicy is found to be unlawful.  Thus, defendants seck to have tl1is statement from the opinion \nvacated; and, in addition, they seck leave to prove in the first phase of the trial that plaintiff Gruttcr \nwould not have been admitted even under a race-neutral admissions policy, in which case there will \nbe no need to bifurcate the trial, since there will be no occasion to address the damages issue. \nThe second half of the opinion in Lesage shows that the relief defendants seck is not \nwarranted.  After the above-quoted passage, the Supreme Court went on to say: \nOf course, a plaintiff who challenges an ongoing race-conscious \nprogram and seeks forward-looking  relief need not affirmatively \nestablish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not \nconsidered.  The relevant injury in such cases is \"the inability to \ncompete  on  an  equal  footing.\"  Northeastern  Fla.  Chapter, \nAssociated Gen.  Contractors ofA  merica v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. \n656 (1995). . . .  But where there is no allegation of an ongoing or \nimminent constitutional violation to support a claim for forward \nlooking relief, the government's conclusive demonstration that it \nwould have made the same decision absent the alleged discrimination \nprecludes any finding of liability . \n. . . [I]n deciding that summary judgment was improper, the Court \nof Appeals did not distinguish between Lesage's retrospective claim \nfor damages and his forward-looking claim for injunctive rcliefbascd \non continuing discrimination. Further, in their petition for certiorari, \npetitioners assert that\" ... there is no allegation that the department \nof counseling psychology continues to usc race-based admissions \n5 \n\n-·--\n----~-----·-·  --~-----~----\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 6 of 10    Pg ID 543\nsubsequent  to  the  Fifth  Circuit's  Hopwood  v.  Stale  of Texas \ndecision.\" The brief in opposition docs not contest this statement. It \ntherefore  appears,  although  we  do  not  decide,  that  Lesage  has \nabandoned any claim that the school is presently administering a \ndiscriminatory admissions process. \nInsofar as the Court of Appeals held that petitioners were not \nentitled to summary judgment on Lesage's § I 983 claim for damages \nrelating to the rejection ofhis application for the 1996-1997 academic \nyear even if he would have been denied admission under a race \nneutral policy, its decision contradicts our holding in MI. Healthy. \nWe therefore grant the petition for writ of certiorari and reverse the \njudgment of the Court of Appeals in this respect. \nLesage also asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981  and 2000d \n(Title VI).  Whether these claims remain, and whether Lesage has \nabandoned  his  claim  for  injunctive  relief on  the  ground  that \npetitioners arc continuing to operate a discriminatory admissions \nprocess, arc matters open on remand. \n120 S. Ct. at 469 (citation added). \nThe Supreme Court distinguished between \"a discrete government decision\" and an \n\"ongoing race-conscious program.\" This court read Lesage as standing for the proposition that the \nMt. Healthy defense can be used to defeat liability for a money damages claim where plaintiff is \ncomplaining about a \"discrete\" decision on an application in a particular year and where plaintiff \ndocs not allege the continuing existence of a racially discriminatory admissions policy.  In the \npresent case, plaintiff alleges the existence of such an admissions policy.  Therefore, defendants \ncannot avoid liability by asserting the Mt. Healthy defense.  Certainly, there is nothing in Lesage \nwhich suggests that the plaintiff class in the present case may not receive at least nominal damages, \nsince \"the relevant injury in such cases is 'the inability to compete on an equal footing.\"' lei., 120 S. \nCt.  at 468.  If the plaintiff in the present case proves that defendants'  admissions policy is \nunconstitutional, then defendants' liability is established and at that point plaintiff will be entitled \nto at least nominal damages.  If there arc class members who would not have been admitted under \n6 \n\n···--· --·--- ········------\n~-~--- ~~-\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 7 of 10    Pg ID 544\na race-neutral system, those individuals will not be entitled to compensatory damages; however, this \nis an issue which will be addressed in the damages phase of the trial.  The court concludes that the \nJanuary 7, 1999, opinion was correct on this issue, and there is no reason to change the order as to \nbifurcation. \nB. Class Certification \nIn this section of their motion, defendants repeat their argument from the fall of 1998 \nthat this case should not be certified as a class action because plaintiffs complaint seeks damages, \nand class-wide resolution of damages claims requires notice to all class members and an opportunity \nto opt out of the class.  Defendants' principal case for this proposition, when the issue was first \nbriefed and again in the instant motion, is Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Com., 151 F.3d 402 (5'h Cir. \n1998). In tlmt case, plaintiffs were a group of 130 African-American employees of defendant Citgo \nPetroleum Corporation, and applicants for employment.  They alleged race discrimination under \nTitle VII, and sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and punitive \ndamages. Plaintiffs sought to certify a class of all African American employees and applicants from \n1979 to the present.  The district court denied the motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.  The \nbasic holding of Allison is that class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) is appropriate if the \nclaim for non-monetary relief \"predominates.\"  Conversely, certification under this subrulc is \ninappropriate when plaintiffs' demand for damages is not merely \"incidental to\" their demand for \ninjunctive or declaratory relief.  The court stated: \nBy incidental, we mean damages that flow directly from liability to \nthe class as a whole on the claims forming the basis of the injunctive \nor declaratory relief. . . . Ideally, incidental damages should be only \n7 \n\n-----·---------------· \n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 8 of 10    Pg ID 545\nthose to which class members automatically would be entitled once \nliability to the class ... as a whole is established.  That is, the \nrecovery of incidental damages should typically be concomitant with, \nnot merely consequential to, class-wide injunctive or declaratory \nrelief.  Moreover,  such  damages  should  at  least  be  capable  of \ncomputation by means of objective standards and not dependent in \nany significant way on the intangible, subjective differences of each \nclass member's circumstances.  Liability for  incidental damages \nshould not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits \nof each individual's case .... \nAllison, 151 F.3d at 415 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). \nThe court's January 1999 opinion indicated the court's belief that the primary form \nof relief sought in this case is injunctive and declaratory.  The only damages which arc being \ndetermined on a class-wide basis arc clearly incidental, as they would be nominal damages to which \neach class member would be entitled, if the court were to find that defendants' admissions policy is \nunconstitutional.  The court's opinion also made clear that the trial will be bifurcated, and that \nnothing will be determined in the first phase other than liability.  This is perfectly consistent with \nAllison.  If liability is found,  the court can revisit the  issue of whether class certification is \nappropriate before proceeding with  the  damages phase.  It may  well  be that any claims for \ncompensatory or punitive damages must proceed on an individual, not on a class action, basis. \nIn addition to restating their reliance on Allison, defendants now also argue that class \ncertification is inappropriate because the class members have not been given notice of the class \naction and an opportunity to opt out.  In this connection, defendants rely principally on a recent \nSupreme Court decision, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corn .. 119 S. Ct. 2295 (1999).  Defendants argue that \nthe class members have a due process right to be given notice of the action, and an opportunity to \nopt out, because to the extent they have a claim for money damages they should be given the chance \n8 \n\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 9 of 10    Pg ID 546\nto decide whether to remain in the class or to pursue their own lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs correctly argue that Ortiz is readily distinguishable from the present case. \nOrtiz involved the certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(l)(B), which applies to \"limited fund\" \ncases.  The court's January 1999 opinion specifically concluded that this subrulc docs not apply in \nthe present case, as there is no \"limited fund.\"  Ortiz was an asbestos case, in which a class was \ncertified in order to divide a $2 billion settlement fund.  The Supreme Court held that class \ncertification was inappropriate because the class excluded certain persons who should have been \nincluded, such as  persons who presently had individual lawsuits pending against defendant and \npersons who had previously dismissed cases but retained the right to reopen in the event they became \nill.  The rights of these excluded persons to money damages were being litigated, and no notice or \nopportunity to opt out had been given.  The Supreme Court also found that this was not a proper \n\"limited fund\" case because the amount of the fund was set by negotiations between the lawyers and \nthe insurance companies. \nOrti:>; bears no resemblance to the present case.  In the present case, the main relief \nat issue is declaratory and injunctivc1 in Ortiz plaintiffs were primarily interested in money damages. \n; \nIn the present case, the class was certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(I)(A) and 23(b)(2); in Ortiz, \nthe class was certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(I)(B).  In the present case, the class has been \ncertified in order to litigate the issue of defendants' liability; in Ortiz, the class was a \"settlement \nclass\" which was certified to disburse a fund created for that purpose.  And in the present case, the \n1 In this connection, plaintiff correctly notes at page 17 of her response brief that \"[n]o \nclass mcmbcr[s] will be deprived of their jury trial right to a damages determination because the \nfirst and only class-wide phase of the bifurcated proceedings will relate solely to claims for class \nwide injunctive and declaratory relief regarding defendants' race-conscious admissions policy.\" \n9 \n\n--\n-------~--------------\n2:97-cv-75928-BAF   Doc # 167   Filed 04/19/00   Pg 10 of 10    Pg ID 547\nissue of the constitutionality of defendants' admissions policy is of equal interest to  all class \nmembers; in Ortiz, the class members all had unique, individual claims to the settlement fund, which \nmeant that there was a great potential for conflicts of interest between class members.  The court \nconcludes that Ortiz docs not call into question the propriety of the certification order. \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, the court concludes that the correctness of its January \n7, 1999, order bifurcating the trial and certifying the plaintiff class has not been called into question \nby subsequent Supreme Court authority.  Accordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that defendants' motion for relief from order regarding class \ncertification and bifurcation in light of subsequent authority is denied. \n0 \nRNARD A.
