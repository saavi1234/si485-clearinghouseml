They, however, filed a motion to strike their names from plaintiffs’ witness list, a motion this court granted \nin its discretion. Phase II transcript (II Tr.) 1226-28. Nor did their attorney offer any exculpatory evidence on their \nbehalf. \n \n3  The Attorney General has often discouraged, in his opinions issued pursuant to M.C.L.A. s 14.32, attempts by the \n  SBE to increase the integration of Michigan public schools. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. \nBoard of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction reviewed various complaints requesting his assistance \nin preventing the establishment of racially identifiable schools. The Superintendent refused to act upon these \ncomplaints on the ground that he had been advised by the Attorney General that he had no authority to act. Oliver, \nsupra, 368 F.Supp. at 186. More recently, the Attorney General ruled that the SBE may not impose student and staff \nracial balance regulations that include sanctions against local school districts for noncompliance, such as termination \n42 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 467 F.Supp. 630 (1978)   \n \n \nof state school aid payments. As a result of that opinion, Superintendent Porter testified that the SBE issued \nadvisory guidelines, rather than mandatory regulations, in an effort to encourage fourteen racially impacted school \ndistricts in Michigan (including Benton Harbor) to integrate their schools. II Tr. 724-30. See also, testimony of SBE \nBoard Member Marilyn Kelly, II Tr. 1092-95. This latter ruling of the Attorney General is questionable in light of the \nbroad constitutional and statutory powers of the SBE. See p. 635, Infra. It is also inconsistent with previous opinions \nof the Attorney General deeming the SBE to have the authority to promulgate expulsion rules, Op.Atty.Gen., July 7, \n1970, No. 7705; to set the length of the school year, Op.Atty.Gen., Dec. 1, 1970, No. 4714; and to establish a \nprogram for accrediting schools, Op.Atty.Gen., May 5, 1971, No. 4707. The opinion in Bradley v. Milliken, 484 F.2d \n215, 248 (6th Cir. 1973), also notes that previous Attorney General opinions have held that the SBE may withhold \nlocal district funds for the hiring of uncertified teachers, for defaulting on state loans, and for other reasons. \n \n4  Plaintiffs’ Exhibit on Remand (PXR)-251. The “Joint Policy Statement” was reaffirmed by the SBE in 1973. The \n  statement is reproduced in its entirety in Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 346 F.Supp. 766, 776-77 \n(W.D.Mich.1971). \n \n5  PXR-54. There appears to have been no follow-up to pressure the local districts in any way to implement these \n  suggestions. See, Oliver, supra, 368 F.Supp. at 189-90. Dr. Robert Green, plaintiffs’ expert witness, stated in his \nrebuttal testimony that the SBE has failed to provide effective leadership to implement the Joint Policy Statement \nand desegregate Michigan schools.

The  parties  consumed  a  great  deal  of  court  time  debating  whether  the  matter  was  a  “riot”  or  a \n  “disturbance.” Whatever name is given the incident, it is clear that it was the result of the failure of the defendants \nhere to resolve the deeper problems of the Benton Harbor district and was extremely disruptive of attempts to \nmake the 1965 consolidation of the BHASD a functioning reality. \n \n9  Id. \n \n \n10  Berrien County Intermediate School District Exhibits (I)-54b, - 58, - 59, -62, -63. \n \n \n11  I-90, -91.

As noted above, Judge Kent stated: \n \n“(T)he neighborhood school concept as it exists in the school system which is before this Court necessarily results in \nthe denial of equal opportunity for education to the black child who is forced because of other circumstances to \nattend a predominantly black school.” \nThe court went on to state: \n“If this were a case of first impression, this Court would reach a conclusion contrary to that reached by the Court of \nAppeals in Deal. This Court is not satisfied that it has the authority to reach such a conclusion on this record and \nwith these findings of fact. \nThis court is further satisfied that there is a substantial issue of law on the findings of fact upon which the court has \nsaid the plaintiffs may base a judgment, and that there is a substantial issue of law upon the findings of fact which \nthis Court has made which would lead the Court to reach a conclusion contrary to that reached by the Court of \nAppeals in Deal. \nAnd so, any judgment that is submitted by either side, or as reached by counsel working together, may embody in it \na certificate granting a right to appeal the judgment before any decree for relief is entered, under the provisions of \nTitle 28 U.S.Code Section 1292(b). And I would suggest in that connection, gentlemen, that a copy of the opinion be \nappended to the application to the Court of Appeals for such appeal. It may very well be that, based upon the \nfindings made in this case, that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, if it accepts the case on that basis, will make \nprovision for relief beyond that which might not be permitted under the Deal and Goss decisions.“ Id. at 18-19. \n \n44  PXR-13. \n \n \n45  See the Opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirming this court’s preliminary injunction against the \n51 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v.

For instance, between the 19 72/73 and \n19 73/74 school years, the number of tuition students from Benton Harbor increased by 72 students. Eau Claire’s \nWhite student population increased 56 and Black student population decreased by 16 students. The only reasonable \ninference is that the number of White tuition students from Benton Harbor far exceeded the percentage of White \nstudents in BHASD (35%). PXR-12. \n \n120  PXR-292 through -298.

II Tr. \n1098-99. Although the instant case remained pending before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals at the time of the \napproval, no mention of the Berry case was made at either the BCISD nor the SBE hearings. \nThe plaintiffs and the State defendants stipulated that Eugene Krasicky, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \nDivision of Education and Retirement in the Michigan Attorney General’s office and principal legal advisor to and \nattorney for the SBE and the Superintendent, would testify that he first learned of the instant case some time during \nApril-June, 1971, during the trial of the Detroit school desegregation case and was informed at that time that several \nproperty transfer petitions involving the BHASD were pending. Mr. Krasicky would testify further that he promptly \nmet with the SBE and Superintendent in executive session, informed them that in his opinion it would be ill-advised \nfor the SBE to grant property transfers from a school district that was a defendant in school desegregation litigation. \nKrasicky Stipulation at 1-2. There is no evidence that the Attorney General’s office advised the SBE that the appeal in \nthe instant case remained pending before the Sixth Circuit during the course of the Sodus II proceedings. \n \n136  Ironically, the Eaman area was transferred to Coloma at a time when many of the Coloma schools were on split \n  sessions. See Part IV, Infra. \n \n137  SBE Ex. 7-b. \n \n61 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 467 F.Supp. 630 (1978)   \n \n \n \n138  The only transfer petition filed since July 3, 1974 was the Watts petition (7 children, $15,475 SEV) heard by the \n  BCISD on July 23, 1974. The petitioners sought transfer from BHASD to the Watervliet School District. Benton Harbor \nobjected, Watervliet had a “position of neutrality,” and the BCISD denied. Mr. Watts appealed to the SBE but failed \nto appear at the State hearing. The SBE voted to uphold BCISD decision on February 5, 1975. \n \n139  Testimony of Lester Page, former President of the BHASD Board, II Tr. 1033-34. \n \n \n140  See Part I(B)(1). \n \n \n141  Green, II Tr. 4431-32. The reason given by the SBE in vacating the Sodus II transfer was as follows: \n \n“The State Board of Education, as a matter of policy, does not grant or affirm property transfers when a school \ndesegregation case is pending with regard to any district involved in the transfer. Although the Berry case was \npending at the time of the original proceedings before the Hearing Officer with regard to this transfer, this fact was \nnot known to the Hearing Officer and was not brought out in the testimony, and, thus, not called to the attention of \nthe State Board of Education. Therefore, because of lack of notice of the pendency of the Berry case, the State \nBoard of Education acted contrary to its policy in affirming the granting of the transfer.” PXR-122. \nThe reason offered by the SBE gives no indication that the original transfer was improper in any way, only that they \nwere unaware of the pending litigation. Such a statement is hardly reassuring to Black students who had their \nself-worth assaulted by the earlier approval. \n \n142  See the report on “The Demography of the Benton Harbor School District,” EC Ex. 20. \n \n \n143  Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Complaint at 10. \n \n \n144  Id. at 9. \n \n \n145  II Tr. 3498. \n \n \n146  State Boundary Commission (SBC) Ex. 5 at 2. \n \n \n147  One major change was an expansion of the eastern boundary to take advantage of the commercial development \n62 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v.

Plaintiffs’ expert witness in rebuttal refuted the contention that the Intermediate Board’s \n  action could have no effect: \n“. . . (I)t would indicate readily to those who are concerned about the integration of (sic.) the desegregation of \nschool districts, that the Intermediate School District has shifted its opinion . . .. (T)he one granting or granting of \nthat request sends a clear-cut message to school districts throughout the state that an Intermediate School Board . . \n. no longer felt that it was necessary or appropriate to maintain factors in such a way that they do not lead to a \nsegregated school system.” \nGreen, II Tr. 4436-37.

The impact of these generally applicable state education changes on the remedial order has \nbeen the subject of a number of opinions of this court. The continuing availability of Coloma and Eau Claire as \nschools-of-choice options to BHASD students also formed part of the consent judgment. \n \n2  Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 435, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). \n \n \n3  Prior to trial, plaintiffs moved to exclude the testimony of Dr. Christine Rossell on the grounds that her opinions and \n  analyses do not comply with the evidentiary requirements of FED.R.EVID. 702, reflecting the standards adopted in \nKumho Tire Co. Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), and Daubert v. Merrell \nDow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (dkt. # 1723). The court took \nthat motion, together with two other challenges to expert testimony (dkt. # 1717, 1724), under advisement. As a \nnumber of courts have recognized, the court’s “gatekeeper” function under Kumho and Daubert is less critical when \nthe court itself serves as the trier of fact. See, e.g., Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F.3d 491, 499 (5th Cir.2000); Ekotek Site PRP \nComm. v. Self, 1 F.Supp.2d 1282, 1296 n. 5 (D.Utah 1998). A court sitting as trier of fact frequently will allow the \ntestimony to be heard, then will disregard that evidence which is inadmissible or unpersuasive. See In re Dow \nCorning Corp., 237 B.R. 364, 371 n. 23 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1999). The court now finds that Dr. Rossell’s testimony is \nsubstantially admissible under the standards of Rule 702. While the court acknowledges that certain comparisons \nconducted by Dr. Rossell are of limited utility, such as a comparison of dollars spent by states in desegregation \ncases, those comparisons are not methodologically or scientifically invalid; they merely rest on a faulty assumption \nthat the relative amount of monies spent by other states in implementing different remedial orders is relevant to \nthe State’s compliance with court orders or whether the vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated in the \ninstant case. The court therefore concludes that such evidence is admissible, even if ultimately unpersuasive. \nFurther, Dr. Rossell’s testimony in large measure provides evidentiary support for a contention plaintiffs admit, i.e., \nthat the BHASD had eliminated the vestiges of discrimination in the Green factors. No possible basis exists for \nexcluding evidence tending to prove what plaintiffs admit to be true. Taken together, Dr. Rossell’s testimony is \nadmitted and plaintiffs’ motion to exclude (dkt. # 1723) is DENIED. \n \n4  As with Dr. Rossell, plaintiffs moved to exclude Dr. Armor’s analyses and opinions on the grounds that they did not \n21 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 195 F.Supp.2d 971 (2002)   \n164 Ed. Law Rep. 248 \n \n  meet the evidentiary requirements of FED.R.EVID. 702. As I previously determined with respect to the opinions of \nDr. Rossell, the court’s gatekeeper role is less critical and the potential for prejudice is limited when the court itself \nis the trier of fact and is free to disregard unpersuasive or unsound opinion evidence. See Gibbs, 210 F.3d at 499; \nEkotek, 1 F.Supp.2d at 1296 n. 5. I am persuaded that Dr. Armor’s analysis properly applies ordinary and accepted \nstatistical analyses to information reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. While the limited years of data \navailable to Dr. Armor may affect the reach and credibility of his opinions, they nevertheless provide information \nthat is the subject of reliable scientific methodology. Any limitations on the usefulness of Dr. Armor’s analyses, \ntherefore, do not undermine the general admissibility of the evidence, but go only to the weight such evidence \nshould be given. \n \n5  “MEAP” tests are tests conducted under “Michigan Educational Assessment Program,” the Michigan state-wide \n  testing program. \n \n6  Dr. Armor and other experts testified about the measurement of poverty using indicators of socioeconomic status \n  (“SES” factors). Dr. Armor testified that the correlation in Benton Harbor between free and reduced lunch eligibility \nand multiple SES indicators captured by the census was .9, a nearly perfect correlation. \n \n7  A standard deviation in this context is equivalent to about one year’s worth of academic progress. (Tr. 154 Armor.) \n \n \n8  The court notes, however, that the usefulness of this control is limited by the substantial increase in the percentage \n  of students in poverty in the selected census tracts. According to Dr. Crain, the percentage of students in poverty in \nthese tracts increased from approximately 45% to approximately 66%. Census tract control, therefore, is only partial \nand is not useful in controlling for poverty in individual student performances or in comparing BHASD performance \nto that of any other group. \n \n9  The court therefore does not discuss the opinion evidence of plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Richard Hunter or the opinion \n  evidence of Dr. Stevens insofar as it goes to whether achievement may be further improved. \n \n10  The remedial order did not affirmatively state that 25% of the openings in magnet schools should be reserved for \n  interdistrict transfer students. Instead, the order declared that it was the court’s expectation that 10% to 25% would \nbe filled by interdistrict transfer students and that 75% of the places in any magnet would be reserved for resident \nstudents. 515 F.Supp. at 366. \n \n11  Although the placement of this sentence in the report immediately after a discussion of the fact that Coloma and \n  Eau Claire students were placed on a waiting list suggests that the numbers were meant to reflect the number of \napplicants and enrollees from those districts, the numbers are not consistent with the total number of Eau Claire \nand Coloma students who actually were enrolled in the entire school during that year. Since students who have \n22 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 195 F.Supp.2d 971 (2002)   \n164 Ed. Law Rep. 248 \n \nbeen accepted in one year may continue, the total number of openings in any given year is limited to the number of \nstudents who do not continue, either by dropping out or graduating. Given the program’s attractiveness, the \nmajority of openings most likely occurred in the entering kindergarten class. The reported number of openings (40) \nis consistent with this scenario of 1/7 of total enrollment in the seven-grade school (259), plus a few. \n \n12  Plaintiffs tendered Dr. Leonard Stevens as an expert in school desegregation, school reform and the monitoring of \n  compliance with desegregation orders. Defendants moved in limine to exclude the testimony of Dr. Leonard Stevens \n(dkt. # 1717) on the grounds that it failed to meet the standards of FED.R.EVID. 702, arguing that it consists of \nimpermissible legal conclusions and does not represent the product of reliable principles and methods. The court \nconcludes that Dr. Stevens testimony regarding usual methods of evaluating desegregation compliance is sufficiently \ngrounded in reliable principles and methods to be admitted. Further, Dr. Stevens did not and could not testify as to \nlegal  conclusions.  Instead,  he  testified  concerning  the  feasibility  of  compliance  measures  and  the  ordinary \ncompliance measures used in evaluating desegregation compliance. To the extent his opinions may be interpreted \nas improperly suggesting legal conclusions, this court is fully able to disregard them. \n \n13  The hearing on the motions for unitary status concluded on August 16, 2001, but proofs were left open for limited \n  testimony from Dr. James Comer on the elements of his program and what constitutes proper implementation of \nthe program. For a variety of reasons, Dr. Comer’s testimony was not able to be taken until October 24, 2001. The \ntranscript from October 24, 2001, was recorded by a different reporter and is not number sequentially with the \nearlier 15 days of proceedings. The transcript from that date hereafter will be designated in the form “(10/24/01 Tr. \n______ Comer.)” \n \n14  In its liability finding, this court held that “[s]chool districts in Michigan are instrumentalities of the State and \n  subordinate to the State Board of Education and its Superintendent.” 467 F.Supp. at 635. That finding provided one \nbasis for holding the State defendants liable for the segregation in the BHASD. The finding represents the law of the \ncase, see United States v. Moored, 38 F.3d 1419, 1421 (6th Cir.1994), and is consistent with certain conclusions \nreached  by  other  courts.  See  Moore  v.  School  Reform  Bd.  of  the  City  of  Detroit,  147  F.Supp.2d  679,  688 \n(E.D.Mich.2000) (school districts have no powers or functions except as provided by the State); East Jackson Public \nSchools v. State, 133 Mich.App. 132, 348 N.W.2d 303, 306 (1984) (same). \n \n15  As previously stated, I recognize that Dr. Crain’s analysis was based on census tract information because of the \n  failure of the BHASD to retain free and reduced lunch information for the period of the remedial order. The \navailability of the lunch data would have been of great help to the court and to plaintiffs in defending the motions. \nNevertheless, I am persuaded that Dr. Armor’s statistical analysis is proper and together with the other evidence, \nleaves little doubt that present achievement is explained by factors associated with high poverty, not past \ndiscrimination. \n \n16  The small number of white students in the comparison group may affect to some extent the statistical certainty of \n  the conclusion, but the correlation is nonetheless adequate to reach the stated conclusion within a reasonable \ndegree of certainty. The problem also is less concerning in light of the statistic’s consistency with other evidence in \n23 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v.

See Berry, 442 F.Supp. at 1296 n. 15. \n \n11 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 703 F.Supp. 1277 (1986)   \n51 Ed. Law Rep. 875 \n \n2  Mr. Lucas originally represented this first group of plaintiffs’ counsel. On October 28, 1985, Mr. Lucas withdrew from \n  this case and Mr. Dimond assumed his representation of this first group of plaintiffs’ attorneys. \n \n3  Generally, a federal district judge should not pass upon an attorney fee petition by a judge within the same judicial \n  circuit. See Brinkman v. Gilligan, 557 F.Supp. 610, 614 n. 9 (S.D.Ohio 1982). Nonetheless, given defendants’ failure to \nobject, the relatively small amount of hours expended on this case by Judge Jones, and the need to avoid further \ndelay in making this fee award, I find that Judge Jones’ petition may properly be considered by this court. \n \n4  In their memorandum supporting their petition for attorneys’ fees, plaintiffs’ counsel also refer to 20 U.S.C. § 1617 \n  as a statutory basis for their petition. In 1978, Congress repealed that statutory provision. No question exists, \nhowever, that 42 U.S.C. § 1988 applies to this case even though enacted in 1976. See Northcross, 611 F.2d at 633–34 \n(finding that section 1988 applies to all cases “pending” at the time of the enactment of the statute); Gaines v. \nDougherty County Board of Education, 775 F.2d 1565, 1570 n. 11 (11th Cir.1985). \n \n5  I note that only attorneys Lucas, Demchak, Atkins, and Sussman have included hours expended in pursuit of their \n  fees and costs. “An attorney is entitled to attorney fees under § 1988 for his or her time spent on the attorney fee \npetition.” NAACP, Detroit Branch, 620 F.Supp. at 1185. \n \n6  Judge Jones does not explicitly state the hourly rate that he seeks. Nonetheless, his affidavit, filed along with the \n  affidavit of Mr. Atkins which explicitly seeks an hourly rate of $200.00, specifies that “[t]he hourly rate set forth is a \nreasonable amount charged by counsel with comparable experience and responsibility.” \n \n7  All hourly rates applied in this case are set according to reasonable hourly rates for 1986 rather than reasonable \n  hourly rates at the time of service. Such an approach, as the parties agree, obviates the need to consider inflationary \neffects and delayed payment. See Gaines v. Dougherty County Board of Education, 775 F.2d 1565, 1572 n. 14 (11th \nCir.1985). \nATTORNEYS  REASONABLE HOURLY RATE \n   \nLouis R. Lucas  $150.00 \n   \nStuart J.

Additionally, $12,832.50 of Mr. Atkins’ fee \n  and $2,748.75 of Ms. Demchak’s fee properly belong to the NAACP—SCF for work done while employed by the \nNAACP—SCF. That portion of Mr. Atkins’ fee for services rendered between May 1, 1980 and July 1, 1984 belongs to \nthe NAACP—SCF. Ms. Demchak’s fee for services rendered between October, 1980 and November 15, 1982 belongs \nto the NAACP—SCF.

School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 515 F.Supp. 344 (1981)   \n \n \n3  This school desegregation case was originally heard by Judge W. Wallace Kent. Judge Kent found that several \n  practices of the defendant BHASD were discriminatory. However, he concluded that the racial imbalance in the \nBenton Harbor schools was not a result of de jure segregation. The Sixth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in \npart, finding that a prima facie case of de jure segregation had been made out against the Benton Harbor School \nDistrict. (505 F.2d 238 (6th Cir. 1974)). The case was remanded to the district court to provide an opportunity for the \nschool district to rebut. \nOn remand, the case was reassigned to Judge Noel P. Fox. Motions by plaintiffs to add additional defendants and \nto enjoin transfer of a predominantly white area (Sodus II) out of the BHASD to the Eau Claire district was granted. \nThe added defendants were the Michigan State Board of Education; John W. Porter, as Superintendent of Public \nEducation of the Board of Education of the State of Michigan; the Berrien County Intermediate School District and \nthe Boards of Education of the Eau Claire School District and the Coloma School District. The Sixth Circuit affirmed \nboth the issuance of the injunction and the court’s order adding additional defendants. Liability was heard and \ndecided in two phases by Judge Fox. The first phase included findings of liability against the Benton Harbor School \nDistrict, 442 F.Supp. 1280 (6th Cir. 1977). The second phase included findings of liability against the added \ndefendants, 467 F.Supp. 630 (6th Cir. 1978). \n \n4  All of the defendants added in August, 1974, including the state defendants and the Coloma and Eau Claire School \n  Districts, are referred to as “added defendants”. \n \n5  See, 442 F.Supp. 1280 (W.D.Mich., 1977). \n \n \n6  Black, racially-identifiable schools within the Benton Harbor School District and their percentage of black enrollment \n  in the 1980-81 school year are: Bard 99.7%, Boynton 99.9%, Calvin Britain 98.1%, Martin Luther King 99.2%, Morton \n99.2%, Seely McCord 98%, Sterne Brunson 98.8%, and Benton Harbor Junior High School 98%. These enrollment \nstatistics are taken from attendance data compiled in a district-wide count on October 3, 1980. \n \n7  This achievement information is taken from the most recent scores on the Michigan Educational Assessment \n  Program 1980-81 (MEAP), Proportions Reports. \n \n8  On April 23, 1966, the State Board of Education and the Michigan Civil Rights Commission adopted a Joint Policy \n  Statement on Equality of Educational Opportunity. This Joint Policy Statement was reaffirmed by the State Board of \nEducation in 1973. The Statement is reproduced in the court’s opinion in Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, \n346 F.Supp. 766, at 776 (W.D.Mich.1973). \n \n9  The Supreme Court has said in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, at 420, 97 S.Ct. 2766, at 2775, \n  53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977) (Dayton I ), that the extent of a defendant’s participation in a desegregation remedy should be \ndetermined by “how much incremental segregative effect these violations had on the racial distribution of the ... \nschool population as presently constituted, when that distribution is compared to what it would have been in the \n81 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 515 F.Supp. 344 (1981)   \n \n \nabsence of such constitutional violations. The remedy should be designed to represent that difference ...” (Emphasis \nadded) \n \n10  At  least  two  district  courts  have  rejected  the  “alternative  universe  theory”  suggested  by  the  discussion  of \n  “incremental segregative effect” in Dayton I. See, Booker v. Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, 451 F.Supp. \n659 (Minn.1978), and Armstrong v. O’Connell, 463 F.Supp. 1295 (E.D.Wis.1979). When factors such as housing, \neconomic and employment discrimination, as well as conduct by school administrations, result in racial changes and \nracial isolation within an area, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate each factor and measure precisely the \nextent of the impact or present effect of any one segregative action. \n \n11  The U.S. Supreme Court found in its opinion in Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189, at 203, \n  93 S.Ct. 2686, at 2695, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) that a determination of state-imposed segregation and a substantial \nportion of a school district could support a finding of de jure segregation throughout the district. The Court, \nhowever, indicated that in some circumstances the physical and geographic makeup of an area might prevent a \ndistrict court from applying this presumption. \n“This is not to say, of course, there can never be a case in which the geographical structure \nof, or the natural boundaries within, a school district may have the effect of dividing the \ndistrict into separate, identifiable and unrelated units. Such a determination is essentially a \nquestion of fact to be resolved by the trial court in the first instance, but such cases must be \nrare.” \n \n12  The importance of local control over schools and children’s education was emphasized by Dr. Herbert Walburg, \n  Professor of Urban Education and Human Development and Learning at the University of Illinois, in his testimony on \nthe issue of achievement motivation. Local control of schools has been identified as unique to the American system \nof public education and a significant factor contributing to success of public education. See also, Milliken I, 418 U.S. \nat 741-742, 94 S.Ct. at 3125-3126, “No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control \nover the obligation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of \ncommunity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process.” \n \n13  Academic debate has intensified about the question of the extent of educational benefits realized by children as a \n  result of integrated education. Researchers and writers find it difficult to agree on the effect of desegregation on \nblack student achievement. See, Coleman, “New Incentives for Desegregation”, 7 Human Rights, No. 3, at 10 (1978), \nCrane, R. and Mahard, R. “Desegregation and Black Achievement: A Review of the Research”, 42 Law and \nContemporary Problems, No. 3, at 17 (1978).

United States, 429 U.S. 990, at 991, 97 S.Ct. 517, at 517, 50 L.Ed.2d 603 (1976); and Columbus \n82 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 515 F.Supp. 344 (1981)   \n \n \nBoard of Education v. Pennick, 443 U.S. 449, at 479, 99 S.Ct. 2941, at 2987, 61 L.Ed.2d 666. \n \n14  The importance of the role of the parent in stimulating achievement was emphasized by Dr. Walberg in his \n  testimony on the factors that contribute to achievement stimulation and achievement lag. There has been found a \nhigh correlation between the extent of emotional support from parents, parental interest in children’s schoolwork, \nparental intellectual stimulation of children and a child’s achievement and motivation. \n \n15  The performance of fourth grade students on 1980 Michigan Statewide Achievement Tests indicate that at least 11 \n  of the 21 elementary schools have “high needs” for improvement in achievement motivation and cognitive skills. \nThree of these 21 elementary schools have only kindergarten through third grade classes. No fourth grade \nachievement tests were given in those schools. All three junior high schools are identified as schools with “high \nneeds”, based on the most recent seventh grade performance on achievement tests. There is a high correlation \nbetween low achievement and racially-identifiable black schools. \n \n16  See footnote 6, supra. \n \n \n17  Schools that are racially identifiable as white schools within the Benton Harbor School District followed by the \n  percentage of their white student population are: Martindale 71.9%, Millberg 96.9%, and Pearl 65.4%. \n \n18  The Supreme Court long ago in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, at 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 \n  (1955) (Brown I ), identified the existence of one race schools and the exclusionary practices that create them as \ngenerating within black children “a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their \nhearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.” \n \n*    \n1980/8\n \n1 \nenroll\nment \nestima\nted  to \nbe  69 \nnon-bl\nack,  0 \nblack \n \n**  Includes 69 students currently assigned to Eamon in the Coloma School District \n83 \n \n\n \n \nBerry v. School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 515 F.Supp. 344 (1981)   \n \n \n   \n*  Junior High population projected on a factor of 25.4% of elementary population. \n \n \n19  The Eamon Schools student population is 100% white, Millburg has a 3.1% black student population and Martindale \n  a 28.1% black student population. \n \n20  The court in its Phase I opinion on liability said: “Segregated black children tend to infer that they are isolated from \n  the white majority because of their race, and, drawing on the observations of the deprivations experienced by black \nadults, they also tend to infer their own potential as limited because of their race. It is not surprising that black \nchildren have evidenced reduced self-esteem in a segregated environment and concomitant diminished motivation \nto succeed. The culturally-induced lack of self-esteem and diminished motivation in turn operate to measurably \nreduce achievement.” See, Berry v. Benton Harbor, 442 F.Supp. 1230, at 1289 (D.C., 1977). \n \n21  Research and writing on the issue of classroom interventions designed to improve self-esteem and achievement \n  motivation include the following: Aronson, E., Stephan, C., Sikes, J., Blaney, N., and Snapp, M., Cooperation in the \nClassroom, Beverly Hills: Sage Publishing Company (1978); Asher, S.R., “Children’s Peer Relations”, in M.

School Dist. of City of Benton Harbor, 515 F.Supp. 344 (1981)   \n \n \nIn 1967, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, then engaged in overseeing the desegregation of numerous \nschool districts in the South, laid down the following requirement in an en banc decision: \n“The defendants shall provide remedial education programs which permit students attending or who have \npreviously attended segregated schools to overcome past inadequacies in their education.” United States v. \nJefferson County Board of Education, 380 F.2d 385, 394, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 77, 19 L.Ed.2d 104 \n(1967). (Emphasis supplied.) \nSee also Stell v. Board of Public Education of Savannah, 387 F.2d 480, 492, 496-497 (CA5 1967); Hill v. Lafourche \nParish School Board, 291 F.Supp. 819, 823 (ED La.1967); Redman v. Terrebonne Parish School Board, 293 \nF.Supp. 376, 379 (ED La.1967); Lee v.

Two years later, the Fifth Circuit again adhered to the rule that district courts could properly seek to \novercome the built-in inadequacies of a segregated educational system: \n“The trial court concluded that the school board must establish remedial programs to assist students who \npreviously attended all-Negro schools when those students transfer to formerly all-white schools.... The \nremedial programs ... are an integral part of a program for compensatory education to be provided Negro \nstudents who have long been disadvantaged by the inequities and discrimination inherent in the dual school \nsystem. The requirement that the School Board institute remedial programs so far as they are feasible is a \nproper exercise of the court’s discretion.” Plaquemines Parish School Bd. v. United States, 415 F.2d 817, 831 \n(1969). (Emphasis supplied.) \nThe Court went on to say: \nIn the 1970’s, the pattern has been essentially the same. The Fifth Circuit has, when the fact situation \nwarranted, continued to call for remedial education programs in desegregation plans. E. g., United States v. \nTexas, 447 F.2d 441, 448 (1971), stay denied sub nom. Edgar v. United States, 404 U.S. 1206, 92 S.Ct. 8, 30 \nL.Ed.2d 10 (1971) (Black, J., in chambers). To that end, the approved plan in United States v. Texas required: \n“(C)urriculum offerings and programs shall include specific educational programs designed to compensate \nminority group children for unequal educational opportunities resulting from past or present racial and ethnic \nisolation ....” 447 F.2d, at 448. \n(Footnote omitted.) \n \n25  The court recommends to the principals in the Benton Harbor school systems two articles which review experiments \n  in  instructional  techniques  used  in  inter-racial  classrooms.

In fact, it is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing \nnumerous competing considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a \nshowing of arbitrariness or irrationality. But racial discrimination is not just another competing consideration. When \nthere is proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, this judicial deference is no \nlonger justified.” \nIn a footnote, 429 U.S. at 271-272, 97 S.Ct. at 566, 50 L.Ed.2d at 468, the court noted that proof that the decision by \nthe defendant was motivated in part by a racially discriminatory purpose would not necessarily require invalidation \nof the challenged action.

Immediately after consolidation and for some time \n  thereafter, the district was known as the School District of the City of Benton Harbor and is so named in the \npleadings. Whether or not there has been a formal name change by the district is not clear. However, for clarity \nthroughout this opinion, and to avoid confusion with the School District of the City of Benton Harbor as it existed \nbefore consolidation (i. e., within the city limits of the City of Benton Harbor), the defendant consolidated district \nwill be referred to consistently throughout this opinion as Benton Harbor Area School District (BHASD). Unless \nnoted, references to “defendant(s)” are references to BHASD. \n \n16  See, M.C.L.A. s 340.431 et seq. and s 388.681 et seq. \n   \n17  M.C.L.A. s 340.431 et seq. \n   \n18  M.C.L.A. s 340.3. \n \n \n19  Testimony of Edward Troffer (Group Director, Operations and Facilities, BHASD; member, pre-consolidation study \n  committee), Transcript of Remand Trial (R-Tr.) at 25. \n \n20  Testimony of James Nettleton (Benton Harbor patent attorney; member of pre-consolidation study committee; \n  former BHASD board member), R-Tr. 662. \n \n21  The figures are based upon plaintiffs’ Exhibit on Remand (PXR)-11 and -12, and Defendant’s Exhibit on Remand \n  (DXR)-D.

Benton Harbor Housing Commission, et al., C.A. 2512 (W.D.Mich.1956). In an opinion entered \n  December 21, 1956, Judge Kent, relying upon Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 \n(1954), and Detroit Housing Commission v. Lewis, 226 F.2d 180 (6th Cir. 1955), found that the defendants unlawfully \ndiscriminated against Blacks by operating one housing project for Blacks and another solely for Whites. The \ndefendant was also found to have refused admission of qualified Black veterans to its veterans housing project \nsolely upon the basis of race. A permanent injunction was entered enjoining such practices. The file in the Askew \ncase was included in the record on appeal in this action. \n \n33  See n. 32, supra; see, also, Testimony of Julia Joseph, R-Tr. 367. \n \n \n34  PXR-90-A. \n \n \n35  PXR-88-A through -88-E. \n \n \n36  PXR-88-G. \n \n \n37  Joseph testimony, R-Tr. 372.

Benton Heights included Bard, Boynton, and Hull schools. In 1965, Bard was 95.7% Black, Boynton was \n78.9% Black, and Hull was 47.1% Black. The implication, therefore, is that Bard school was far beyond 80% Black at \nthe time it gave approval of the new housing project, even before the addition of these new Black students. \n \n42  M.C.L.A.  s  340.411;  s  388.692.
