    "summary": "<p>The Kentucky County Judge/Executive Association filed this lawsuit against the Kentucky Department of Corrections, Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet, and Kentucky General Assembly in Franklin County Circuit Court in Kentucky in 2008. The plaintiff, an organization representing Kentucky's 120 county judge/executives, alleged that Kentucky was obligated under state law to compensate counties for time served in county jail by people later convicted of crimes and sentenced to imprisonment in state prisons. The plaintiff asserted that the state's practice of not compensating counties for the cost of housing these incarcerated people was unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and similar state constitutional provisions. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and attorney's fees and costs. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky ruled against the plaintiff in a lawsuit based on similar grounds in 1969. 938 S.W.2d 582.</p>",

Thompson,  in her official  capacity  Commissioner,  Kentucky \nas \nDepartment  of Corrections. \nCOMMONWEALTH  OF  KENTUCKY  FINANCE  AND \nADMINISTRATION  CABINET \nServe:  Attorney  General  Jack  Conway \n700  Capital  Avenue,  Suite  118 \nFrankfort,  Kentucky 40601 \nAND \nKENTUCKY  GENERAL ASSEMBLY \nServe:  Hon.  Senator David  Williams,  President,  Kentucky  State  Senate \nHon.  Representative  Jody Richards,  Speaker,  Kentucky House  of Representatives \nComes  the Plaintiffs,  Kentucky County Judge  Executive Association,  Inc.  (\"KCJEA\")  and \nthe  above named  County Fiscal  Court  Plaintiffs,  by  counsel,  and pursuant  to  KRS  418.040  et  seq. \nand CR 57, hereby bring this  action seeking a Declaratory Judgment that KRS 431.215  (2) and KRS \n441.025  (1)  are  unconstitutional  because  said  statutes  contravene  the  Kentucky  Constitution  and \ndeclaring  that  the  Commonwealth  Kentucky  is  responsible  for  reimbursement  to  the  counties  for \nexpenses incurred by the counties  for prisoners housed in county jails for which the inmate receives \na  credit  for time  served,  for the reasons  set  forth below: \nTHE  PARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff  is  a  corporation  duly  organized  and  existing  under  the  laws  of  the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky with its principal  office  address  at  115  East  Second  Street,  Frankfort, \nKentucky 40601. \n2.  The  Defendant,  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,  Justice  and  Public  Safety  Cabinet \n(\"Justice\"),  Kentucky Department of Corrections,  is  a recognized  agency of the Commonwealth of \n\nKentucky and  is  charged  with  the  legal  duty to  house  and  care  for  state  inmates.  Justice  is  located \nat  125  Holmes  Street,  Frankfort,  Kentucky 40601.  Pursuant to  CR 4.04  (6),  Attorney General  Jack \nConway is  the party upon whom process  shall  be  served  in  all  actions  against  the  Commonwealth. \nAttorney  General  Conway's  address  is  200  Capital  Avenue,  Frankfort,  Kentucky 40601. \n3.  The  Defendant.  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,  Finance  and  Administration  Cabinet \n(\"Finance\") is a recognized agency of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and is charged with the legal \nduty of paying  for the housing  and  care  of state  inmates.  Finance  is  located  at  383  Capitol  Annex, \nFrankfort,  Kentucky 40601.  Pursuant  to  CR  4.04  (6),  Attorney General  Jack  Conway is  the party \nupon  whom  process  shall  be  served  in  all  actions  against  the  Commonwealth.  Attorney  General \nConway's  address  is  200  Capital  Avenue,  Frankfort,  Kentucky 40601. \n4.  The Kentucky General  Assembly is  the  sole  legislative body for  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky and is  charged  with the legal  duty of enacting laws  behalf of the  citizens  of Kentucky \non \nwhich  are beneficial  to  the  health  and  welfare  of all  citizens  of the  Commonwealth  and  which  are \nconstitutional.  The Kentucky General  Assembly is joined  in this  action to  give it the opportunity to \naddress  the legal  and  constitutional  issues raised  in this  action relative to  laws  which the Kentucky \nGeneral  Assembly has  previously passed  and  enacted  into  the  law  of the  Commonwealth. \n5.  Jack  Conway is  the Attorney General  of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,  and the agent \nfor  service  of process  of Defendants,  Justice  and  Finance,  pursuant  to  CR  4.04,  as  well  as  legal \nadvisor  of all  state  offices,  departments  and  agencies  pursuant  to  KRS  15.020.  Attorney  General \nConway  is  also  required  to  receive  notice  of the  filing  of the  above-captioned  action,  pursuant  to \nKRS  418.075,  since  it  involves  the validity of a  certain  statute  or  statues  of this  Commonwealth. \n\nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n6.  This  action is brought under KRS  Chapter 418  (the \"Declaratory Judgement Act\").  This \ncourt has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to  KRS  23  A.010,  and venue is proper in this  Court. \nFACTS  AND  CONTROVERSY \n7.  The  Commonwealth  of Kentucky  takes  the  position  that  it  has  no  legal  obligation  to \nreimburse  counties  for  the  costs  associated  with  housing,  feeding  and  providing  health  care  to \ninmates  charged  with  a  felony  who  are  held  in  county  detention  facilities  while  awaiting  trial  or \nsentencing.  After  sentencing  an  inmate  on  a  felony  charge  the  Commonwealth  of Kentucky treats \nthe inmate in the county detention facility as a state inmate prior to sentencing by granting the inmate \ncredit  for time  served  in the  county facility against  the  sentence the  inmate ultimately has  to  serve \nin  a  state prison. \nThe  Plaintiffs  take  the  position  that  inmates  charged  with  felony  who  ultimately \na  are \nconvicted  of a  felony are  state inmates  for all purposes,  including payment  for the inmates housing \ncosts,  while  incarcerated  prior to  final  sentencing  on  a  felony or  felony charges. \n8.  The  Kentucky  Constitution,  Section  §254,  imposes  upon  the  Commonwealth  of \nKentucky the  responsibility  of providing  for  the  care  and  expenses  of convicts,  and  providing  as \nfollows: \nThe  Commonwealth  shall  maintain  control  of \nthe  discipline,  and  provide  for  all  supplies,  and \nfor the  sanitary  condition  of the  convicts,  and \nthe  labor  only if convicts  be  leased. \nmay \n9.  The legal  financial  obligations  of the  Commonwealth  for prisoners,  is  set  forth  in  KRS \n§431.25  (2)  follows: \nas \nWhen  the judgement  imposes  a  sentence  of death  or \nconfinement  in  the penitentiary,  the  county in which \n\nthe prisoner  is  incarcerated  shall  receive  from  the  State \nTreasury a  fee per day following the  day on  which the \njudgment  rendered,  and  ending the  day that  the \nwas \ndefendant  is  delivered  to  the penitentiary.  The  fee  shall \nbe paid  to  the  County Treasurer  for use  in the  incarceration \nof prisoners  as  provided  in  KRS  441.025. \n10.  The  obligation  of the  counties  for housing  prisoners  is  set  forth  in  KRS  441.025  (1), \nwhich provides: \nThe  fiscal  court  of each  county shall  provide  for \nthe  incarceration  of prisoners  arrested  in  the  county \nor  sentenced  or held by order  of the  courts  in this  county. \n11.  Under KRS  531.120  (3),  an  inmate  is  given  credit  for time  served  in  a  County Jail,  as \nfollows: \n[t]ime  spent  in  custody prior to  the  commencement  of a \nsentence  as  a result  of the  charge  that  culminated  in the \nsentence  shall  be  credited by the  court imposing  sentence \ntoward  service  of the maximum  term  of imprisonment.  If \nthe  sentence  is  to  an  indeterminate  term  of imprisonment, \nthe time  spent  in  custody prior to  the  commencement  of the \nsentence  shall  be  considered  for  all  purposes  as  time \nserved  in prison.  (Emphasis  added). \n12.  The  counties  are  required  to  bear  the  expense  of housing  state  prisoners  who  are \nawaiting  trial  or  sentencing  on  state  felony  charges  and  who  are  subsequently  convicted  and \nsentenced  on  a  felony charge.  However,  the  Commonwealth receives  the benefit  of the time  credit \ngiven to  the inmate for the time spent in a county jail  awaiting trial  and sentencing thereby reducing \nthe  time  the  inmate  will  spend  in  a  state  penitentiary  and  the  Commonwealth  does  not  pay  or \nreimburse  Counties  for  expenses  associated  with  such  incarceration  in  County jails. \n13.  Because of the conflicts between the statutes  and the constitution there  exists  actual \nan \ncontroversy  between  the  parties  regarding  whether  the  Commonwealth  should  pay  for  prisoner \n\nhousing  costs  for prisoners  charged  with  a  felony while  awaiting  trial  or  sentencing that  is  ripe  for \nresolution by this  Court. \nCOUNT  I \n14.  The Plaintiffrealleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained \nin  numerical  paragraphs  1  through  13. \n15.  Because  KRS  531.120  (3)  states  that  time  in  county  custody  is  \"considered  for  all \npurposes\"  as  time  spent  in  state  custody,  an  inmate's  time  in  county  custody  as  a  state  prisoner \nshould be  treated  as  the  state's  financial  obligation,  and  the  Commonwealth  should be required  to \nreimburse  the  counties  for  fees  incurred  for housing  such  convicts. \nCOUNT  II \n16.  The Plaintiffrealleges and incorporates byreference each and every allegation contained \nin numerical  paragraphs  1  through  15. \n17.  The  application  of  KRS  441.025  (1),  KRS  431.215  (2)  and  KRS  532.120  (3) \ncontravenes the mandates of  §  254 of the Kentucky Constitution which places the responsibility for \ninmate  upkeep  on  the  Commonwealth,  and  relies  upon  designations  and  distinctions  that  have  no \nrational  or  reasonable  basis  or  purpose  and  are  therefore  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  violation  of \nSection  II  of the  Kentucky  Constitution  as  well  as  other federal  and  state  laws. \n18.
