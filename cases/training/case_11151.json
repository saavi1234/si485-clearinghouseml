The objective of the consent decree was to decrease the level of segregation in federally assisted housing programs and the private housing market and increase desegregative housing choices and opportunities for class members and other low income people in Allegheny County. &nbsp;The Initiatives to achieve the goals included: the purchase of scattered site homes to replace demolished public housing units; the establishment of a Fair Housing Services Center to provide mobility counseling for applicants for public and Section 8 housing, including 450 desegregative Section 8 vouchers and 409 vouchers to additionally replace demolished public housing units; modernization and/or re-building of county public housing developments in the Sanders communities to provide equivalent housing conditions and amenities; and the set-aside of 2~ percent of the county's federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for seven years to be used to improve the housing and economic conditions in seven target communities. These communities were selected because they contained the highest concentration of African American public housing and Section 8 residents and had experienced the greatest degree of physical decline and disinvestment. &nbsp;HUD was required to report annually on its progress. &nbsp;The decree enjoined each defendant &ldquo;to implement [its terms] and take all actions necessary to fulfill its obligations.&rdquo; &nbsp;Moreover, the decree called for the creation of the Sanders Task Force, composed of the plaintiffs and defendants in the case, ACHA residents and non-profit organizations, such as the Fair Housing Services Center, the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh, Just Harvest, the National Conference on Community and Justice, and Womansplace of Western Pennsylvania. &nbsp;One of the Task Force&rsquo;s principal responsibilities was the planning and expenditure of nearly $30 million of the CDBG funds.</p>\r\n<p>On December 22, 1994, Judge Diamond entered final approval of the consent decree. &nbsp;872 F.Supp. 216. &nbsp;As part of the settlement, the court retained jurisdiction for at least seven years and reserved the right to extend jurisdiction if the terms of the decree were not satisfied. &nbsp;The court subsequently extended jurisdiction based on several disputes about fulfillment of the decree&rsquo;s terms. &nbsp;Specifically, on August 30, 1996, the plaintiffs moved to compel compliance with the consent decree, which Judge Diamond granted on February 5, 1997. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted in part and denied in part the motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs by plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel on March 14, 2001 for work performed between 1995 and 1998.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During the intervening years, disputes among the parties regarding compliance with the Decree arose, some of which necessitated court intervention. &nbsp;On December 23, 2004, the parties reached a settlement agreement to end the Decree. &nbsp;After hearing no objections, the Court terminated the Decree on January 28, 2005.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel subsequently filed a petition for attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred from 1999 up to the termination of the decree. &nbsp;The court granted in part and denied in part on September 30, 2005. &nbsp;2005 WL 2416355. &nbsp;The case is now closed. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Specifically,  after making \nadjustments  to plaintiffs'  requested hourly  rates  and  reducing \nthe  specific  number  of  hours  claimed,  the  court  will  approve \nattorneys  fees  of  $501,505.05  and  costs  of  $2,776.47  for  a \nI \ntotal award of  $504,281.52  for  the  requested period.  Pursuant \nto  the  court's  ruling  on  proportionality,  HUD  would  be \nresponsible for 65%  of  the  fees  and costs,  $327,782.98,  and ACHA \nwould  be  responsible  for  35%,  $176,498.54.  However,  in order \nto  avoid  a  windfall  to  plaintiffs,  who  will  receive  $194,000 \nfrom ACHA  in a  settlement arrived at by those parties,  the court \nwill deduct  $17,501.46,  the excess  of  the settlement amount  and \nthe  35%  liability amount,  from  HUD's  portion,  thus  HUD  will  be \nresponsible  for  only  $310,281.52  of  the  total  award. \nThe  parties  are  intimately  familiar  with  the  factual  and \nprocedural background of this case and the court,  in its opinion \ndated March 14,  2001  (Document  No.  511),  exhaustively set  forth \nthat  background  through  that  date.

Class members \nwere  given  notice  of  the  proposed  settlement  agreement  and  an \nopportunity to be  heard  at  a  hearing  which  was  held before  the \ncourt  on  January  28,  2005.  With  no  objections,  this  court \nentered an order dated January 28,  2005,  terminating the Decree. \n(Document  No.  627). \nOn  February  18,  2005,  plaintiffs'  filed  the  pending \npeti tion  for  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  for  the  period  from \nJanuary 1,  1999,  to February 17,  2005.  Responses  in opposition \nto  the  petition were  filed  by  both  HUD  (Document  No.  637)  and \nACHA  (Document  No.  638),2 and plaintiffs filed a  response  to HUD \n2  RAAC  and  the  County  filed  a  joint  statement  in  response  to \nplaintiffs'  petition  (Document  No.  635)  noting  that  HUD  had \nagreed to indemnify,  defend and hold the County harmless  for any \nand  all  fees  and  costs  awarded  by  the  Court.  The  statement \nalso  noted  that  RAAC  had  only  limited  obligations  under  the \nconsent  decree  and  that  plaintiffs  had  not  alleged  that \n~C \n- 4 \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 5 of 26\nand  ACHA's  oppositions  (Document  No.  639)  in  which  certain \nadjustments  were  made  to  the  fee  request. \nSubsequently,  plaintiffs and ACHA  entered into a  settlement \nagreement  and  release  whereby  ACHA  agreed  to  pay  $194,000  in \nattorney's  fees  and  costs.  By  order  dated  August  29,  2005, \nplaintiffs'  petition was  withdrawn  as  to  ACHA  only.  (Document \nNo.  645).  On  September 6,  2005,  plaintiffs filed a  revised fee \npetition  in  light  of  the  settlement  agreement  with  ACHA. \nPlaintiffs'  petition now  is ripe  for  resolution. \nAt  the  outset,  the  court  notes  that  the  parties have  been \ninstructed that the court considers its findings and conclusions \nas  set  forth  in  its  March  14,  2001,  opinion  and  order,  as \nmodified  by  its  April  23{  2001,  order,  granting  in  part  and \ndenying  in  part  plaintiffs'  petition  for  an  interim  award  of \nattorneys'  fees,  to  be  the  settled  law  of  the  case.  The \nparties  have  been  informed  that,  in  the  absence  of  any \njustification for doing so,  the Court will not  revisit its legal \nconclusions  from  that  opinion  and  intends  to  apply  those \nconclusions  to  plaintiffs'  pending  petition  for  a  final  award \nof  fees.  The  court  therefore will  analyze  the pending petition \nin  light  of  the  law  as  it  found  it  to  be  in  its  March  2001 \nopinion. \nClass counsel's pending  request  seeks  an award of  fees  and \nbreached those obligations nor that plaintiffs had expended any \ntime  monitoring  RAAC's  activities  in  regard  to  those \nobligations  and,  therefore  RAAC  has  no  responsibili ty  or \nI  I \nliability for  any  awarded  fees  or  costs. \n- 5  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8I82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 6 of 26\nexpenses for work undertaken to implement and enforce the Decree \nfrom  January  1,  1999  to  February  17,  2005.  The  initial \npetition  requested  a  total  fees  award  of  $762,793.62,  as  well \nas  expenses  in the  amount  of  $2,776.47.  This  requested  amount \nlater  was  modified  in  plaintiffs'  response  to  HUD's  partial \nopposition  to  plaintiffs'  petition  and  again  in  plaintiffs' \nrevised fee petition filed after plaintiffs reached a  settlement \nagreement  on  fees  with  ACHA.  After  these  revisions,  class \ncounsel  now  seeks  a  total  fees  award against HUD  of  $467,315.04 \nas  well  as  expenses  of  $1,804.71. \nHUD  has raised numerous objections to plaintiffs'  requested \nfees  award  in  regard  to  the  reasonableness  of  both  the  hourly \nrate  requested  as  well  as  the  total  number  of  requested  hours. \nHUD's  position  is  that  it  is  only  responsible  for  a  total  of \n$145,982.22  in  fees  and  that  it  is  not  responsible  for  any \nexpenses. \nUpon  due  consideration of  plaintiffs'  petitions  and  HUD's \nobjections,  as well  as the court's March 2001  opinion,  the court \nbelieves  that  certain adjustments  are  necessary both as  to  the \nrequested  hourly  rate  and  the  number  of  hours,  however,  not  to \nthe  extent  suggested by HUD.  In the  end,  the  court  finds  that \nclass counsel  is entitled to a  total  of  $504,281.52  in fees  and \ncosts,  a  figure  the  court  arrived  at  by  applying  the  below \nanalysis  guided  by  the  standards  set  forth  in  its  March  2001 \nopinion. \nClass  counsel's  petition is brought  pursuant  to  42  U.~.C. \n- 6  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 7 of 26\n§1988!  which  permits  a  court!  in  its  discretion!  to  award \nreasonable  attorney! s  fees  in  any  action  or  proceeding  to \nenforce  a  provision  of  the  federal  civil  rights  laws.

The  court determined that those rates were \n\"'adequate to attract competent  counsel  but  [would]  not  produce \nwindfalls  to  attorneys. '\"  Public  Interest  Group  of  N.J.,  Inc. \nv.  Windall,  51  F. 3d  1179,  1185  (3d  Cir.  1995)  (quoting  Student \n- 8  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 9 of 26\nPublic  Interest Research Group  of New  Jersey,  Inc.  v.  AT&T  Bell \nLab.,  842  F.2d  1436,  1448  (3d  Cir.  1988)). \nIn  the  pending  petition,  class  counsel  asks  the  court  to \nuse  the  $160  and  $120  figures  as  a  base  but  to  increase  those \nrates  by  34.66%,  which  is  the  increase  in  the  Consumer  Price \nIndex-All  Urban  Consumers  for  legal  services  between  January \n1999  and  December  2004.  With  this  increase,  plaintiffs seek \nto  be  awarded  fees  at  an  hourly  rate  of  $215.45  for \nmonitoring/enforcement  services  and  at  an  hourly  rate  of \n$161.59  for  administrative/implementation  services  without \nregard  to  the  year  in  which  the  services were  rendered. \nHUD  opposes  plaintiffs  requested  hourly  rate  on  several \ngrounds.  First,  HUD  contends  that  plaintiffs  are  limited  by \nthe  Equal  Access  to  Justice  Act  (\"EAJA\")  to  a  cap  of  $75  per \nhour  adjusted  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index-ALL  index,  and, \nsecond,  that  cost-of -living  increases  to  that  cap  must  be \ncomputed  at  \"historic  rates\"  (on  a  year by  year  basis)  so  that \nplaintiffs  are  not  paid  in  2004  dollars  for  work  done  as  much \nas  five or six years previously.  Accordingly,  HUD  proposes that \nplaintiffs be  compensated at an hourly rate of  $133.78  for  1999 \nwork,  with  yearly  increases  topping  out  at  an  hourly  rate  of \n$154.01  for  work  done  in 2005. \nHUD's  first  contention,  that  this case  is governed by caps \nimposed  by  the  EAJA,  is  without  merit.  First,  contrary  to \nHUD's  assertions,  the  pending  fee  request,  like  plaintiffs' \nprior request for interim fees,  has been made pursuant to §1988, \n9 \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 10 of 26\nnot  the  EAJA.  Although  it is  true  that  the  court  referenced \nthe EAJA  in its March  2001  opinion,  it did so not  to analyze  the \nfee  request  under  EAJA  standards,  but  instead  to  serve  as  a \nbenchmark to compare  the reasonableness  of  the hourly rate that \nthe  court  computed  under  the  standards  of  §1988. \nMoreover,  HUD  has advanced no  justification for this court \nto  revisit  its  formula  for  assessing  a  reasonable  hourly  rate \nas  enunciated  in the  March  2001  opinion,  and,  as  the  court  has \nadmonished  the  parties,  that  opinion  serves  as  the  settled law \nof  the  case.  Accordingly,  HUD's  contention that  the EAJA  caps \nthe hourly rate to be  applied under  the  pending petition is not \nwell  taken. \nHowever,  the  court  does  believe  that  there  is  merit  to \nHUD's  contention  that  plaintiffs  should  not  be  paid  at  2004 \nrates  for  all  hours  expended  from  1999-2005  as  requested  by \nclass  counsel.  To  the  contrary,  to  award  class  counsel  fees \nat 2004  rates  for work  done  years  earlier not  only would  result \nin a  windfall  in violation of the  statutory purposes underlying \n§1988,  but  also  would  reward  them  for  needlessly  complicating \nthe  fee  fixing  process  by  delaying  their  application  for  fees \nand  costs  for  years  after  the  work  was  done  and  they  became \nentitled to  such  an  award.  See  also  fn  3,  infra. \nIf  a  defendant  raises  a  sufficient  question  as  to  the \nreasonable hourly rate,  the court has discretion in determining \na  reasonable rate for the services rendered.  See Rode,  892  F.2d \nat  1183.  Here,  defendant  has  raised  a  sufficient  question  as \n- 10 \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 11 of 26\nto  the  reasonableness  of  the  requested  hourly  rate,  and, \ntherefore,  the  task again  falls  upon  the  court  to  ascertain an \nhourly  rate  for  work  done  between  1999  and  2004  which  would  be \nadequate  to  attract  competent  counsel  but  would  not  result  in \na  windfall  to  class  counsel. \nThe  task  before  the  court  now  aptly  was  outlined  in  the \ncourt's prior March  2001  opinion  and  bears  repeating  here: \n[I]t  does  not  appear  to  the  court  that  the \npurpose  of  §1988  would  be  served  by \npermitting  class  counsel  to  maneuver \nthemselves  into  prominent  and  time \nconsuming  roles  in long-term and  extensive \nimplementation  processes  and  receive \ncompensation therefor at hourly rates which \nare  designed  to  attract  competent  counsel \nto  assume  the  contingent  risk  of \nestablishing  liability  in  the  most \nprominent  civil  rights  cases.  The  court \nthus  is  required  to  consider  all  of  the \nunusual  circumstances  presented  and \ndetermine  an  hourly  rate  for  each  category \nof  services  rendered  which  is  both \nreasonable  and  takes  into  account  these \ncountervailing considerations,  a  task which \nis  less  than precise  and  arguably  involves \na  form  of  line-drawing \nOpinion,  March  14,  2001  at  53-54  (citation omitted) . \nWith  these  concepts  in  mind,  the  court  will  proceed  to \nascertain a  reasonable hourly rate for the work performed during \nthe  years  1999-2005  using  the  $160  and  $120  hourly  rates  for \nmonitoring/enforcement  work  and  administrative/implementation \nwork,  respectively,  as  calculated  in  the  March  2001  opinion  as \na  base. \nUtilizing  the  United  States  Department  of  Labor  Bureau  of \nLabor Statistics Consumer Price Index tables for legal services \n1 \n- 11  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 12 of 26\nwhich  plaintiffs'  submitted  as  Exhibit  4  to  their Appendix  to \nPetition for  an Award  of Attorney's  Fees  and  Expenses  (Document \n632),  the  court  has  calculated  the  rate  for  cost-of-living \nincreases  for  each  year  from  1999  to  2004  by  applying  the \nincrease at  the  end of  each ensuing year starting with December \n30,  1998.

The  court  is  satisfied  that  this  is  a \nfairer  method  of  arriving  at  an  appropriate  hourly  rate  than \nplaintiffs'  counsel's request  that they be  compensated for 1999 \nwork  at  2004  rates. \nFor example,  had plaintiffs'  sought  fees at the end of 1999 \nfor  the  hours  expended  during  that  calendar year,  their hourly \nrates  under  the  court's  formula  for  that  year  would  have  been \n$168.16  and $126.12  respectively.  However,  plaintiffs chose  to \nwait until 2005  to seek payment  for work done  in 1999  and sought \npayment  for  that  work  in  2004  dollars,  i.e.,  at  the  rate  of \n$215.45 per hour for enforcement/monitoring work.  If the court \nwere  to  adopt  plaintiffs'  position,  they  would  obtain  an \nincrease of  $47.29 per hour  in legal  fees  for  1999by the  simple \nexpedient  of  delaying  their  application  therefor.  That  in  no \nway  can  be  justified or deemed  reasonable. \nMoreover,  plaintiffs'  counsel  concede  at  page  11  of  their \nresponse  brief  that  they  are  not  seeking  and  that  they  are  not \nentitled  to  interest.  However,  the  effect  of  paying  them  in \n2004 dollars for services provided in earlier years would amount \nto  the  same  thing.3  The  court  believes  that  plaintiffs  should \n3  The  court does not believe that Garcia v.

However,  that  case  is  distinguishable  because  the \nplaintiff in that case did not become  entitled to fees until the \n- 13  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 14 of 26\nnot  profit  from  their  six  year  delay  in  filing  their  fee \nrequest.

The  standards governing an  analysis \nof  what  constitutes  reasonable  are  set  forth  in  detail  in  the \ncourt's  prior  opinion,  and  those  standards  guide  the  court's \nanalysis of  the pending  fee  petition.

Board  of \nII \nEducation  of  Memphis  City  Schools,  611  F.2d  624,  637  (6th  Cir. \n1979)  cert.  denied  447  U.S.  911  (1980). \nA  review  of  the  reductions  made  to  each  attorney's  time \nsheets under  these principles is set  forth below.  The  specific \ndetails  of  the  court's  comprehensive  calculations  for  each  of \nthe  six  years  under  review  is  set  forth  at  the  end  of  this \nopinion. \nA.  Donald  Driscoll \nDonald  Driscoll  is  lead  counsel  for  plaintiffs  in  this \ncase.

HUD  arrived  at  its  figure  by  making  the  following \ndeductions  to  the  number  of  hours  requested:  (1)  work  on \nmonitoring/enforcement activities not  directly involving HUD  or \nthe County;  (2)  20%  reduction for excessiveness and duplication; \n(3)  20%  reduction  for  Task  Force  work  between  2001  and  April \n2003;  and, (4)  full  deduction  for  all  Task  Force  work  after May \n1,  2003.4  Upon  review,  the  court  believes  that  many  of  these \ndeductions  are  not  warranted. \nFirst,  the  court  does  not  believe  that  full  deductions  of \nall hours  relating to  activities not  directly involving HUD  or \nthe  County  are  warranted.  As  noted  in our prior opinion,  and \nas  the Decree makes  clear,  \"HUD  is primarily responsible for the \nviolations  of  law  which  led  to  the  litigation and  the  Decree\" \nand  \"the  Decree  and  other  law  provide  HUD  with  substantial \noversight  responsibilities  over  the  other  defendants  and  the \ngreatest  degree  of  responsibility  in  implementing  the  Decree.\" \n4  HUD's  opposition  also  sought  deductions  for  work  on  fees \nissues for which  fees  were  settled by agreement  in 2001  and  for \nwork  on  unsuccessful  actions  against  HUD  and  the  County.  In \ntheir  response  to  HUD's  opposition,  plaintiffs  recognized  the \nappropriateness  of  these  deductions  and  modified  their  claim \naccordingly. \n- 16 \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 17 of 26\nOpinion,  March  14,  2001  at  84.  Thus,  merely because an action \ndid  not  directly  involve  HUD  does  not  negate  HUD's  overall \nresponsibility for  enforcement  of  the  Decree. \nLikewise,  the  court  finds  no  basis  to  deduct  all  hours \nspent on Task Force activities after May  1,  2003.  HUD  contends \nthat  such a  deduction is warranted because after the April  2003 \nadoption  of  the  final  plan,  no  further  work  on  the  Task  Force \nwas  necessary.  However  as  plaintiffs  point  out  in  their \nI \nresponse,  Task  Force  responsibilities  and  activities continued \nafter  that  April  2003,  and,  in  fact,  numerous  Task  Force \nmeetings  took  place  after  that  date  in  which  both  counsel  for \nplaintiffs  and  defendants  participated.  Accordingly,  HUD's \ncontention  that  all  time  spent  on  such  activities  after April \n2003  should  be  deducted  is without  merit. \nHowever,  the court does believe that some  reduction in time \nis  necessary  to  all  of  attorney  Driscoll's  hours  based  on \nexcessiveness  and  duplication of  services  between  counsel.  As \nthe  court  noted  in its March  2001  opinion,  a  reasonable  amount \nof  consultation  among  co  counsel  regarding  the  multifaceted \ncomponents  of  the  Decree  certainly  had  to  have  been  expected \nunder the settlement agreement which HUD  presented to the court. \nHowever,  the court does believe that the overall hours submitted \nby  counsel  is  to  some  extent  duplicative  and  overall  is \nexcessive.  Thus  the  court  will  reduce  all  requested  hours  by \n20%  in  order  to  account  for  excessiveness  and  duplication  of \nservices. \n17 \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 18 of 26\nOtherwise,  the  remaining  hours  submitted  by  attorney \nDriscoll were  useful  and necessary to secure the  relief flowing \nfrom  the  court's  order,  and  the  court  therefore  will  approve \nthose  hours  subject  to  the  percentage  reductions  noted  above. \nAccordingly,  the  court  will  award  for  attorney  Driscoll's \nservices  842.88  monitoring/enforcement  hours  and  2074.08 \nadministrative/implementation hours  at  the  year-by-year  hourly \nrates  set  forth  above. s \nB.  Thomas  Henderson \nThomas Henderson is an attorney with the Lawyers'  Committee \nfor  Civil  Rights  Under  Law  and  has  practiced  law  since  1977. \nAttorney  Henderson  seeks  fees  for  16.71  hours  of  primarily \nsupervisory work that he performed on this case between 1999 and \n2004.  HUD  argues  that  attorney  Henderson  is  entitled  to,  at \n5  For the period between 1999 and 2005  attorney Driscoll  claims \n1053.6  hours  for  his  monitoring/enforcement  activities  and \n2592.6  hours  for  his  administrative/implementation activities, \nfor  a  total  of  3646.2  hours  claimed.  Thus,  29%  of  the  total \nhours claimed by attorney Driscoll is for monitoring/enforcement \nand  71%  for  administrative/implementation.  Attorney  Driscoll \ndid not  break  down  these  hours  on  an  annual  basis.  The  court \nhas  done  this  from  the  invoices  attorney Driscoll  submitted and \nin  the  process  reduced  the  hours  by  20%  and  allocated  29%  of \neach  yearly  total  hours  to  monitoring/enforcement  and  71%  to \nadministrative/implementation.  In light of the court's finding \nthat  a  different  rate  is  applicable  for  each  year,  after \nreducing  the  total  hours  by  20%,  the  court  will  break down  the \nyearly requested hours by the same  percentage  of  overall hours, \ni.e.,  for  each  year,  the  court  will  assume  29%  of  hours  were \nspent on monitoring/enforcement activities and 71%  of hours were \nspent  on  administrative/implementation  activities.  A  similar \nbreakdown by percentage  is made  to the hours of attorney Nepvue, \nwho  spent  19%  of  her  overall  requested  time  on \nmonitoring/enforcement  activities  and  81%  on \nadministrative/implementation activities. \n- 18  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8f82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 19 of 26\nmost  fees  for  7.46  hours  of  work  in  1999/  as  all  other  hours \n1 \nwere  spent  on  activ  i ties  not  actively  involving  HUD  or  the \ncounty. \nFor the  same  reasons outlined above  for attorney Driscoll, \nthe court again will  reduce the number of hours requested by 20% \nto  account  for  duplication,  excessiveness  and  overstaffing. \nAccordingly  the  court  will  award  fees  for  13.41  hours  for \n1 \nattorney Henderson/s  work. \nC.  Julie Nepvue \nJul  Nepvue was  a  Staff Attorney at the Lawyers  Committee \n1 \nfor Civil Rights Under Law until November 2002  and has practiced \nlaw since 1991.  Attorney Nepvue  seeks  fees  for  52.55  hours  of \nmonitoring/enforcement  work  and  223.84  hours  of \nadministrative/implementation  work  performed  between  1999  and \n2002.  HUD  argues  that  Nepvue/s  request  should be  reduced  by \n20%  for  duplication of  services  and  for  work  on  activities  not \ndirectly involving  HUD  or the  County. \nUnder  the  same  rationale  as  applicable  to  attorney \nDriscoll/s  request  the  court  will  reduce  the  requested  hours \n1 \nby  20%  and  will  award  fees  for  42.04  hours  of \nmonitoring/enforcement  work  and  179.07  hours  of \nadministrative/implementation work. \nD.  Matthew  Clash-Drexler \nMatthew Clash-Drexler was  a  Staff Attorney at the Lawyers' \nCommittee  of  Civil  Rights  Under  Law  from  November  2001  until \nApril  2002  and  has  practiced law  since  2000.

HUD  opposes  any \nfees  for work done by attorney Clash-Drexler because  it was  all \nfor work on activities not directly involving HUD  or the County. \nApplying  the  overall  20%  reduction  for  excessiveness  and \nduplication,  the  court  will  award  fees  for  54.39  hours  of  work \nperformed  by  attorney Clash-Drexler. \nE.  Jonathon  Hooks \nJonathon  Hooks  is  a  Staff  Attorney  with  the  Lawyers' \nCommittee  for Civil Rights Under Law who has practiced law since \n1999.  Attorney Hooks  requests  fees  for  34  hours  of work  done \nin  2003  (5  hours)  and  2004  (29  hours) .  HUD  opposes  any  fees \nfor  work  performed  by  attorney  Hooks  because  it  involved  work \non  activities  in  which  HUD  or  the  County  were  not  directly \ninvolved. \nApplying  the  overall  20%  reduction  for  excessiveness  and \nduplication,  the  court  will  award  fees  for  27.2  hours  of  work \nperformed  by  attorney Hooks. \nExpenses \nClass  counsel's  revised  fee  petition  seeks  to  recover \n$1,804.71  in  expenses  from  HUD,  which  constitutes  65%  of  the \nrequested  $2,776.47  as  stated in plaintiffs'  initial petition. \nA breakdown of the requested expenses is included as Exhibit B-F \nto Tab  5  of  the  appendix  to  the  initial petition. \nHUD  contends  that  plaintiffs  are  not  entitled  to  any \nexpenses,  alleging  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  plaintiffs' \n- 20  -\nA072A \n(Rev.S/52) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 21 of 26\nexpenses  for Lawyers'  Committee work were  \"reasonably necessary \nfor  its representation of  plaintiffs  in this  case.\" \nThe  court  has  reviewed  the  requested  expenses  in  light  of \nthe  law  as  set  forth  in  the  March  2001  opinion  and  finds  no \nbasis  to  reject  plaintiffs'  requested  expenses.  As  stated in \nthat  opinion: \nThe  plaintiff  class  has  a  right  to  use \nlawyers  which possess  the  requisite  skill, \nexpertise  and  resources  necessary  to \nprotect  their  interests  competently.  The \nLawyers  Committee  has  intimate  familiarity \nwith the context giving rise to Decree,  its \nprovisions and the specialized areas of  law \nwhich  affect  its  implementation.  Under \nsuch  circumstances  the  court  is  obligated \nto  award  the  reasonable  expenses  which \nwould be paid by regular fee-paying clients \nfor  the  use  of  its services. \nExpenses  and  out-of-pocket  costs  which  are  distinct  from \nlitigation  expenses,  such  as  photocopying  costs,  telephone \ncalls,  travel  and  postage,  are  recoverable  as  part  of  a \nreasonable  attorney's  fee  under  §1988.  Abrams  v.  Lightolier, \nInc.,  50  F.3d  1204,  1225  (3d  Cir.  1995)  (citing  in  support \nMissouri  v.  Jenkins  by Agei,  491  U.S.  274  (1989)).  Here,  all \nof  the  expenses  requested  are  for  costs  which  properly  are \nrecoverable  under  §1988. \nAccordingly,  the  court  will  award  the  expenses  as \nrequested. \nProportional  Responsibility \n\"It  is  a  well-established  principle  that  when  mUltiple \ndefendants  are  held  to  be  liable  in a  civil  rights  action,  the \n- 21  -\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 22 of 26\nproper  course  of  action  for  a  district  court  is  to  allocate \nresponsibility  for  the  payment  of  fees  among  the  responsible \nparties.

Where  possible  each  defendant  is  to  IIbear  the \nprevailing  plaintiff's  fees  for  time  spent  on  matters  clearly \nrelated  to  the  claims  made  against  that  defendant.  Id. \nn \n(citation omitted) . \nIn  the  March  14,  2001,  opinion,  the  court  found  that  the \nrecord supported joint and several liability against HUD  for the \nent ire  award.  Because  the  pre- and  post-Decree  record  also \nadequately  supported  the  ACHA's  secondary  responsibility  for \nliability,  the court also found that joint and several liability \nagainst the ACHA  for 35%  of the award also is warranted.  Except \nas  noted  below,  the  County  and  the  RAAC's  proportionate  shares \nare  included  in the  percentage  assigned  to  HUD  in  light  of  the \nstipulation between HUD  and  the  County  and  the  nominal  role  of \nthe  RAAC  throughout  this  litigation.  This  finding  in  regard \nto  proportionality remains  the  law  of  the  case. \nAccordingly,  the  court  will  find  HUD  responsible  for  65% \nof the overall  fees  award.  However,  as already noted,  in order \nto  prevent  a  windfall  to  plaintif  counsel,  the  court  has \ntaken  into  account  the  $194,000  that  plaintiffs'  will  receive \nfrom  ACHA  as  part  of  their  fees  settlement. \nFor the  reasons  noted above,  the plaintiff class'  petition \nfor  an  award  of  attorneys'  s  and  expenses  against  HUD  will \n- 22 \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 648   Filed 09/30/05   Page 23 of 26\nbe  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part.

This resolution is subject to being \nreduced to writing, which should be accomplished promptly, and no later than July 31, \n2005.  Confirmation of the execution of this settlement will be provided to the Court \nimmediately following execution.  ACHA will have no further obligation in this case, \nincluding no further obligation to pay attorneys, costs or other obligations related to the \ncase except as specifically set forth in the Settlement Agreement approved by the Court \non Jan. 28,2005. \nCounsel for plaintiffs and HUD have conferred by phone and were unable to \nreach a resolution of the fee issue.  Counsel for BUD reported that she does not have \nauthority to agree to a fee beyond the amount the government stated it owed in its \nopposition to the plaintiffs' fee petition, and therefore, resolving this by settlement is not \nlikely.  In addition, with respect to disputed issues, HUD's position is set out in its \nresponse to the fee petition.  Should this Court schedule a conference before July 28, she \nasks that she be permitted to participate by phone. \nCounsel for the ACHA, John Hansberry, and HUD, Lisa Olson, have authorized \nthe submission of the above paragraphs applicable to their respective clients to be \nincluded in the parties' joint report in response to this Court's Order dated, June 29, 2005. \nRespectfully submitted, ",

      "title": "Sanders Consent Decree and Task Force: Record of Accomplishments January, 2005",
      "text": "Sanders Consent Decree and Task Force: Record of Accomplishments \nJanuary,2005 \nOn December 23, 2004, the plaintiffs and defendant parties (U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development (HUD), Allegheny County, Allegheny County Housing Authority \n(ACHA) and Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County) reached a settlement, bringing to a \nclose the Sanders Consent Decree.  Following a hearing on January 28, if no substantial \nobjections are received, the proposed settlement will become final and the consent decree \nconsidered fully concluded. \nThe Sanders Consent Decree, signed in December, 1994, called for a number of \ninitiatives to achieve its primary objectives of promoting racial desegregation in ACHA's \nhousing programs (which were offered outside the cities of Pittsburgh and McKeesport) and \nincrease desegregative housing choices and opportunities for African American class members \nand other low income residents of Allegheny County.  Some of these included:  the purchase of \nscattered site homes to replace demolished public housing units; establishment of a Fair Housing \nServices Center to provide mobility counseling for applicants for public and Section 8 housing \nincluding 450 desegregative Section 8 vouchers and 409 vouchers to additionally replace \ndemolished public housing units; modernization and/or re-building of county public housing \ndevelopments in the Sanders communities to provide equivalent housing conditions and \namenities; and the set-aside of 2~ percent of the county's federal Com.nlunity Development \nBlock Grant (CDBG) funds for seven years (1996-2003) to be used to improve the housing and \neconomic conditions in seven target communities: Braddock, Clairton, Duquesne, Homestead, \nMcKees Rocks, Rankin and Wilkinsburg.  These communities were selected because they \ncontained the highest concentration of African American public housing and Section 8 residents \nand had experienced the greatest degree of physical decline and disinvestment. \nAchievements--Housing Desegregation \nOne of the mandates of the consent decree, which received considerable public attention \nand media coverage, was the efforts by the Sanders Task Force to select scattered sites, \n1 \n\nprincipally in suburban locations throughout Allegheny County, for 130 replacement public \nhousing units, which resulted from the 100 units lost at Talbot Towers in Braddock (the original \nimpetus for the lawsuit that lead to the decree) and 30 additional units lost due to efforts to \nreduce density and modernize other developments after the decree went into effect.  These \nreplacement homes, mostly single family and townhouse units, were all successfully purchased \nand renovated by ACHA and occupied by 2002. \nIn accordance with the decree, the Fair Housing Services Center (FHSC) provided \nmobility counseling to all the families considering moving into these units and continued to \nmaintain contact with them to assist with their transition to new locations.  Despite the initial \nskepticism, these units have been very successful, both in terms of attracting applicants and \nretaining occupancy.  Most families have done well in their new neighborhoods, and few \ndifficulties have been reported. \nFHSC also played a primary role in distribution of the 489 desegregative Section 8 \nvouchers that were distributed as part of decree implementation.  All of these vouchers were used \nby the holders to rent housing in non-racially identifiable areas throughout the county.  In \naddition, FHSC worked with persons receiving the 409 replacement vouchers, which were \nprovided by HUD in response to the total number of public housing units lost during 1996-1997. \nMany ofthese also resulted in desegregative housing choices being made by the voucher holder. \nIn an effort to carry out its housing desegregation efforts and serve the 9,000 total \nfamilies that came to the FHSC through the unit offering and mobility counseling process, it also \nworked with ACHA to recruit many new landlords for the Section 8 voucher program.  These \nefforts have helped to expand the affordable housing options for lower-income households in \nareas that traditionally have not been racially diverse. \nWhile at the same time working to increase suburban housing opportunities, FHSC and \nACHA worked to implement a \"group move\" program which would encourage a group of \nseveral non-African American applicants for low income public housing to accept desegregative \nplacements, primarily in ACHA developments located in the Sanders communities.  Beginning \nin 2003-2004, the program included monthly tours and various incentives (such as assistance \nwith moving expenses) for applicants who selected one of the eligible sites. \n2 \n\nOverall, during its operation, the FHSC, working with ACHA and other consent decree \nparties, was able to facilitate approximately 1,400 desegregative placements through the county's \nSection 8 and public housing developments.  It is believed that these efforts represent important \nsteps toward achieving the consent decree's long-term objective of providing more diverse \nhousing choices for low and moderate income households and reducing the concentration of \npublic and Section 8 housing to only a few municipalities in the Allegheny County.  Under the \nsettlement reached to end the decree, ACHA will continue to offer mobility counseling services \nthrough at least January 31, 2007 and will operate the group move program through at least \nJune 30, 2006, when it is anticipated that most of the improvements in the neighborhoods \nsurrounding the family public housing developments will be complete. \nAchievements--Neighborhood Revitalization \nThe consent decree created the Sanders Task Force, composed of representatives frcim \nthe parties to the lawsuit, the Fair Housing Services Center and other nonprofit organizations \nwhich at various times included the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh, Just Harvest, the National \nConference on Community and Justice and Womansplace.  One of its principal responsibilities \nwas the platming and expenditure of the CDBG funds, which over the seven-year set-aside \nperiod totaled about $29.9 million.  Working in partnership with public and nonprofit agencies, \nprivate developers and individual home buyers, the Task Force was able to use these funds to \nbring in an estimated $30.8 million in additional monies to carry out programs for local residents \nand revitalize neighborhoods surrounding family public housing developments, resulting in an \nexcess of $60 million investment in the Sanders communities.  (As will be described below, \nmuch of the physical improvements will be carried out in the next year to two years.) \nBeginning in 1995, the Task Force undertook three major planning initiatives, along with \nseveral housing market studies, in order to identify community needs and feasible projects in the \nseven communities and target neighborhoods.  It also received and considered numerous funding \nrequests from local groups for a wide variety of projects relating to its overall mission in the \nSanders municipalities.  In all, between 1995-2004, the Task Force approved funding for over \n100 projects and related administrative contracts.  Funding was allocated for about 25 other \n3 \n\nprojects, which were subsequently determined infeasible, and the monies were re-programmed to \nother activities.  Many of the projects are now complete or continuing with other sources of \nfunding; others are currently underway; while several are now moving into the planning and \ndesign phases.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Allegheny County will work to \nfinish all remaining neighborhood improvements by the end of 2006. \nIn the early years of its work, the Task Force funded a range ofhuman, workforce and \neconomic development initiatives.  These were aimed at generally increasing employment \nopportunities and the availability of business and community services for public housing and \nother low-income residents in the seven Sanders municipalities.  The Task Force also approved \nresidential \"rehab-for-resale\" funds for all the communities to begin to address deterioration in \nspecific neighborhoods and increase homeownership opportunities for lower income families. \nHowever, in 2001 the Task Force began to recognize that little progress was being made \non one of.the decree's key mandates:  revitalizing the neighborhoods surrounding the six family \npublic housing developments, including Mapleview Terrace in Braddock, Millvue Acres in \nClairton, Bums Heights in Duquesne, Hays Manor and the former McKees Terrace (now the \nprivately-owned Meyers Ridge) in McKees Rocks and Hawkins Village in Rankin. Starting in \nearly in 2002, therefore, the Task Force began to narrow its focus to physically improving these \nneighborhoods.  By this time ACHA had underway or had completed substantial re-building or \nmodernization of all these family developments.  Thus, it became even clearer that the best way \nto preserve or increase the long~term integration in these neighborhoods was to re-establish or \nreinforce them as attractive places to live, for all residents, by building and rehabilitating housing \n(and in the process removing blighting uses), upgrading existing infrastructure (streets, \nsidewalks, utilities, etc.) and improving access to community services, facilities and other \namenities. \nThe Task Force worked with two local consulting firms, municipal officials, community \ndevelopment organizations and local residents to develop specific plans and physical \nimprovement projects for each of these neighborhoods.  In some cases, as in Clairton, the result \nwill be a substantially re-built neighborhood; in others, the focus will be on helping current \nresidents to rehabilitate their homes, providing landscaping and other buffers to protect existing \n4 \n\nhousing from surrounding commercial uses, removing remaining blighted buildings or adding a \nnew community center to serve local residents. \nWhen all the approved projects are completed, it is estimated Task Force efforts, \nthroughout the seven Sanders communities, will result in the: \n•  construction of approximately 91 new homes, \nrehabilitation and re-sale of about 40 existing, vacant homes and \n•  renovation of another 75 to 80 existing, occupied homes. \nIt will also have helped to eliminate numerous vacant, blighted buildings (particularly in \nBraddock, Clairton and Duquesne), renovate older commercial buildings and encourage business \ndevelopment in several community business districts, build or expand community center space in \nfive communities, and improve transportation services for public housing and other low-income \nresidents.  The following sections summarize the achievements, or anticipated outcomes, of the \nmajor improvement projects approved by the Task Force for each Sanders community and \nparticularly the six target neighborhoods.  Achievements of the various human, workforce and \neconomic development programs, designed to serve residents in all or several of the \ncommunities, are described at the end. \nBraddock \n•  Construction of 13 single family, affordable, for-sale homes in the Mapleview \nneighborhood along with improvements (trees, sidewalks, lighting, etc.) for Verona \nStreet \n•  Rehabilitation of 6-8 existing homes on Frazier Street including new sidewalks \n•  Installation of neighborhood parklet on Frazier behind Good Shepherd church \n•  Renovation of vacant commercial building at 849-53 Braddock Avenue to house \ncounty human service, employment and education programs; acquisition of adjacent \nvacant lots to create landscaped parking area for building \n•  Demolition of numerous vacant, blighted buildings on Braddock Avenue \n•  Rebuilding ofMaple Way, between Verona and Library streets, with new lighting, \nlandscaping and similar amenities to create safe, attractive pedestrian access between \nthe eastern and central portions of the borough \n5 \n\n•  Acquisition and landscaping of vacant lot at comer of Braddock and Verona to provide \nan attractive bus shelter and new entry to Mapleview neighborhood \n•  Addition of trees and other planting along railroad tracks to buffer new and renovated \nhomes \n•  Assistance to Heritage Health Foundation to start WorkLink van service to increase \nneighborhood residents' access to employment, shopping and regional facilities. \nBetween February 2001 and December 2004 WorkLink had a total ridership of over \n84,000 on its Braddock/East Pittsburgh route. \n•  Funding for Braddock Library to add new computer lab, messy arts (ceramic) room \nand exercise facility; operate summer and after-school programs; and increase its \nvocation-related and general reading collections \nThe settlement agreement ending the consent decree calls for the county to provide up to \nan additional $1.25 million to implement, to the degree that funding permits,  several \n\"special projects\" which the parties agreed were important to achieving revitalization \ngoals in certain neighborhoods.  In Braddock, the additional projects, in order of funding \npriority; are: \n•  acquisition and demolition (or possible rehabilitation) of one Library Street \nproperty; if demolished, site to be improved with a public parking lot and \nimproved public infrastructure (sidewalks, curbs, street trees and lighting); \n•  streetscape improvements (sidewalks, curbs, street trees, buffer trees and \nlighting) along both sides of Braddock A venue, first between 11th and John \nstreets, then if funds remain, from John to Library Street; and \n•  funding (not to exceed $200,000) for community center space on Library \nStreet.  If the county determines such space is feasible and has long-term \nviability, this project will be an intervening priority before committing funds to \nthe John-to-Library segment of streetscape for Braddock Avenue. \nClairton \n•  Development of 44 housing units, four of which are fully accessible for disabled \npersons and others are designed to be \"visitable\" by \ndisabled individuals.  All units are currently leased by \nindividuals who will be working to obtain a credit toward \nthe purchase of them at the end of a 15-year rental period \nAt the urging of the Task Force, the

\ninclude, as fourth and fifth priorities for the funding, additional demolition (up to \n$200,000) of vacant, blighted structures in this neighborhood and offering rehabilitation \nservices for occupied blighted housing in the vicinity ofHalcomb/Mitchell and Third \nstreets. \n7 \n\nDuquesne \n•  Rehabilitation of two homes for re-sale to lower-income buyers \n•  Construction of 4-6 new

(Document  No.  649).  Pursuant  to \nthat  order,  judgment  in  the  amount  of  $310,281.52  was  entered  in \nfavor  of  the  plaintiff  class  and  against  the  United  States \nDepartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (\"HUDfI\n). \nPlaintiff  subsequently  filed  a  motion  for  reconsideration \n(Document  No.  650)  of  that  order,  specifically  objecting  to  the \ncourt's  20%  reduction of  fees  for  duplication  and  excessiveness, \nA072A \n(Aev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 653   Filed 12/05/05   Page 2 of 4\nand HUD  has  filed an opposition to plaintiffs'  motion.  (Document \nNo.  652).  The  court will  grant plaintiffs'  motion  to reconsider. \nHowever,  upon  reconsideration,  the  court  finds  no  basis  for \ntering  its prior decision. \nThe  legal  principles  upon  which  the  court  arrived  at  the \nchallenged  20%  reduction  to  the  number  of  hours  requested  are \nwell-settled and were  set  forth in detail,  not  only in the court's \nSeptember  29,  2005,  opinion,  but  also  in  its  March  14,  2001, \nopinion  relating  to  interim fees.  Fundamentally,  the  number  of \nhours  expended  on  the  services  rendered  must  be  reasonable. \nHensley v.  Eckerhart,  461  U.S.  424,  433  (1983).  Accordingly,  in \narriving at  a  reasonable  fee,  the  number  of  hours  claimed  can be \nreduced for  a  variety of reasons,  including  the  reasonableness  of \ntime  expended  on  a  particular  task  and  duplication  of  effort. \nUrsic  v.  Bethlehem Mines,  729  F.2d  670,  677  (3d  Cir.  1983). \nAs  it  did  in  its  March  of  2001  opinion,  the  court  in  its \nSeptember  of  2005  opinion  employed  the  fair  approach  of  \"simply \ndeducting  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  hours  to  eliminate \nduplication  of  services.\"  Northcross  v.  Board  of  Education  of \nMemphis  City Schools,  611  F.2d 624,  637  (6th  Cir.  1979).  Utilizing \nthis  approach,  the  court  determined  that  a  20%  reduction  in  the \nnumber  of  hours  claimed  by  each  counsel  for  excessiveness  and \nduplication  of  services  was  necessary  and  appropriate  to  ensure \nthat  the  fees  that  plaintiff counsel  received  were  reasonable. \n2 \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 653   Filed 12/05/05   Page 3 of 4\nUpon  reconsideration,  the  court  still  is  convinced  that  the \n20%  across the board reduction was  appropriate and is supported by \nthe  billing  records  submitted  by  class  counsel.  These  records \ndemonstrate  that  many  of  the  hours  claimed  involved  conferences \nand  consultations  among  the  various  attorneys  fees.  The \ncourt  reviewed s\"ix years'  worth of  billing records  in arriving at \nits prior decision,  and,  upon additional review,  remains convinced \nthat the number of hours claimed by counsel  for pI  iff class in \nfact  were  unreasonable.  under  these  circumstances,  a  20% \nreduction  is  fair  in  order  to  ensure  that  class  counsel  are \ncompensated  only  for  a  reasonable  number  of  hours  expended. \nAn  appropriate  order  will  be  entered. \nORDER \n~~ \nAND  NOW,  this  of  December,  2005,  plaintiff  class \nhaving filed a  Motion for Reconsideration of this court's order of \nSeptember  29,  2005,  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Housing \nand Urban Development  having filed a  response,  the reasons set \nforth  the  memorandum  above,  IT  IS  ORDERED  that  plaintiff's \nmotion,  be,  and  the  same  hereby  is,  granted,  and,  upon \nreconsideration,  the  court  finds  no  basis  to  alter  t  court's \norder dated  September  29,  2005. \n~~ \nGustave  Diamond \nUnited  States  Di  ct  Judge \n3 \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nCase 2:88-cv-01261-GD   Document 653   Filed 12/05/05   Page 4 of 4\ncc:  Donald  Driscoll,  Esq. \nCommunity  Justice  Project \n1705  Allegheny Building \nPittsburgh,  PA  15219 \nLisa  Olson,  Esq. \nDepartment  of  Justice \nCivil  Division \n20  Mass.

The  Plan contemplates \nactivities to be undertaken by  the Allegheny  County Housing \nAuthority  (\"ACHA\")  and  the county of -~llegheny to  implement  a \nvariety of measures  described  in t~e Pian.  Whi~e HUD  hopes  that \nthese  entities will cooperate  in implementing those measures,  it \nthey do  not,  HUO  intends to move  forward with  its desegregation \nefforts  in any  event. \nAs  directed by the Court,  HOD  has  sought the  input  of the \nother parties regarding the Plan.  HUO  officials met  separately \nwith ACHA's  and plaintiffs'  representatives during the week of \nMarch  21.  At  that time,  HUO  presented an  outline of the Plan and \n\nits general  contents,  and  solicited the other parties•  comments \nand  concerns.  Unfortunately,  the county declined to meet  to \ndiscuss  the \nPl~n. \nHUD  provided plaintiffs,  ACHA,  and  the County with copies  of \nthe draft Plan on April  1,  and  again solicited their comments. \nHUD  staff members  met  with plaintiffs'  representatives  on April  5 \nto discuss  plaintiffs'  suggestions  for modifications to the  Plan. \nACHA  did not  convey  its written comments  until late in the \nafternoon of April  7,  which  did not  leave HUD  sufficient time to \nconsider them  for  incorporation  il\".to  the Plan.  The  county did \nnot provide HOD  with  any  comments  on the Plan. \nAlthough HUD  has  already given the parties an  opportunity to \nhave  input  into the Plan,  HUD  has  not,  by the  submission of the \nPlan to the  Court,  categorically foreclosed the possibility of \nmodifying the  Plan on  the basis of suggestions made  by  other \nparties.  Should HUD  determine to  incorporate  substantial \nmodifications  intd the  Plan,  HUD  will  so  advise the court. \nRespectfully submitted, \nFRANK  W.

If, \nhowever,  ACHA,  the County  and/or the ACRA  determine that they \nwill  not cooperate with the  implementation of this plan as  set \nout herein,  HUD  will take whatever actions  it determines  are \nnecessary and  appropriate to  implement  the plan and  achieve  its \npurposes,  including exercising  its oversight and  enforcement \nresponsibilities with  regard to  federal  funds  and  the  Fair \nHousing Act. \nI.  PURPOSE \nThe  purpose  of this Plan  is to set out actions to \ndesegregate  the Allegheny  County Housing Authority's  (ACHA) \nhousing programs,  to  increase housing choice  and  opportunity \nfor  class members  and  other low-income  residents  of \nAllegheny  County,  and  to decrease  racial  spatial  separation \nfor  all residents  of the county. \n%%.  REPLACEMENT  UN%TS \nHUD  has  provided  funding  to the ACHA  for the construction of \n100  units of public housing to replace the units demolished \nat Talbott Towers.  Jefferson Borough  entered  into a \ncooperation agreement with ACHA  which  allowed  forty-four  of \nthe replacement  units to be  constructed  in Jefferson \nBorough.  Within  30  days  of the adoption  of  this plan by  the \nCourt,  a  representative  from  HUD,  Allegheny  County  and  the \nACHA  will meet with  appropriate representative  from \nJefferson  Borough  to resolve-any concerns  the Jefferson \nBorough may  now  harbor about  the replacement units  and  to \nensure that construction of the·44  units begins  as \nexpeditious as possible.  If~the Jefferson Borough  refuses \nto honor  its cooperation agreem~nt and  facilitate the \nconstruction,  HUO  will  take appropriate enforcement action \nagainst the Jefferson Borough. \nWithin  30  days  after the adoption  of this Plan by the court, \nthe ACHA  will undertake  a  study of various  sites throughout \nthe county and  shall select locations  for  the other 56 \nreplacement units.  The  ACHA  shall  choose  locations that \nprovide,  to the greatest extent possible,  desegregative \nhousing opportunities.  If the  locations  selected are  in \nmunicipalities that do  not have  cooperation agreements with \nthe ACHA,  the ACHA,  HUO,  and  the County,  will  engage  in \nnegotiations with the m~nicipalities to resolve any  problems \nwhich might prevent the placement of this housing  in those \nmunicipalities.  If such negotiations are unsuccessful h1JO \n\nwill evaluate the municipalities•  actions  and  if HOD \ndetermines that the municipalities•  actions  in impeding the  · \nconstruction of the  replacement  housing may  violate the \nFair~ \nHousing Act  or other civil rights  statutes and  requirements, \nHOD  may  consider appropriate  actions against the \nmunicipalities  including,  but not  limited to,  withholding or \nconditioning Departmental  funds  and/or the commencement  of a \nSecretary-Initiated complaints under the Fair Housing Act. \nIII.  DEFINITIONS \nA.  Non-Racially  Identifiable Assisted Bousinq Development \nA non-racially  identifiable  family  public housing \ndevelopment  is one  in which  the African-American \npopulation of the development  is between  38  and  58 \npercent.  This  term  is taken  from  the Plaintiffs' \nPreliminary Proposal  of July  5,  1991.  The  plaintiffs' \n38  to 58  percent  range was  derived  from  examination of \nthe  1991  racial composition  in the ACHA's  family  public \nhousing program,  Section 8  program,  and  the combined \nLow  Income  Family Public Housing  (LIPH)  and  Secti.on 8 \nwaiting  lists.  The  range  is equal  to 10  percent above \nor below the  1991  African-American  family  tenant and \napplicant population of  48  percent.  The  Department \naccepts  the plaintiffs'  definition of non-racially \nidentifiable,  but reserves the right to  reevaluate and \nmodify  the standard,  if necessary,  because  of a \nsignificant change  in the  racial composition  of the \nfamily  tenant population and/or applicant pool. \nThe  38  to  58  percent range will  also be used  to \ndetermin:e  whether project based  Section 8  developments, \nmoderate  rehabilitation developments,  231(d)(3) \ndevelopment  and  236  developments  are non-racially \nidentifiable. \nIn applying  the  38-58  percent standard at a  particular \ndevelopment,  appropriate adjustments may  be made  to \ntake  into account the  e£fect· of the  racial composition \nof the project on the neighborhood,  so that the \ndesegregation of the projects. can  facilitate the \ndesegregation of the neighborhoods.  An  appropriate \nadjustment,  for example,  with  regard to  identifiably \nAfrican American  projects  in African American \nneighborhoods  would  be  a  percentage white occupancy at \nthe higher end  of the +/- 10  percent range  so  as to \ndesegregate  the development  and  introduce a  critical \nmass  of white persons  into .these communities. \n2 \n\nA development will not be  considered non-racially \n- identifiable if a  pattern of segregation exists with \n-~· \nthe development. \nB.  Non-~acially Xdentifiable Elderly PUblic Housinq \nDevelopment \nA non-racially  identifiably elderly public housing \ndevelopment  is one  in which  the African-American \npopulation of the development  is 10  percent above  or \nbelow the combined  total percentage of African \nAmericans  occupying elderly units and  on the waiting \nlist for  elderly units. \nove~ercent \nIf a  particular elderly development  is \nwhite,  an upward  adjustment  in the range m~ made \nto target a  higher African American population for that \ndevelopment  because  the existing white  racial \nconcentration  is attributable  in part to: \n1.  The  segregated character of many  of the \ndevelopments. \nThe  segregated character of may  of the development \nlocations. \nThe  percentage of the upward  adjustment  shall be equal \nto the percentage of the  income-eligible African \nAmerican  elderly population  in the ACHA's  area of \njurisdiction. \nNon-Ractally  Xdentifiable Neighborhood \nHOD  and  the plaintiffs will develop  a  plan to  identify \ncommunities  in Allegheny  county that are either: \n1.  appropriate to target. for  improvements,  community \nand  economic development programs,  market-rate \nhousing,  and  othe~non-deep subs~dy programs'  or \n2.  appropriate  for new  low  income  or desegregative \nhousing opportunities. \nD.  Desegreqativa Housinq opportunity \nAn  opportunity to reside  in a  suitable unit in a  public \nhousing development  that is not racially identifiable  . \nas to the  race of the person given  the opportunity,  or \nto obtain a  suitable unit 1n an  assisted housing \ndevelopment  that is not  racially identifiable as to the \nrace of the perso~ given the opportunity,  or the use  of \n3 \n\na  certificate or voucher  after appropriate mobility \ncounseling by  the Fair Housing  services center to \n- encourage desegregative housing  choices,  i.e.,  use  of \nthe voucher where  one•s  race does  not predominate or  is \ndisproportionally present. \nB.  community-Wide  waiting  List \ncommunity-wide waiting  list is one waiting  list that \nserves  the Authority's entire area  of  jurisdiction. \nP.  Good  cause  ~or Refusal  of an Offer \nGood  cause  for  refusal  of an  of~er exists when  an \napplicant  can demonstrate  through  objective evidence \nthat a  move  into the unit offered would  result in a \nhardship  related to  the  ability of the applicant  (or a \nmember  of the applicant's  family)  to  retain his or her \nemployment,  to secure or continue day  care or medical \nservices,  or to obtain a  unit that reasonably \naccommodates  a  disability of  the applicant or a  member \nof his or her  family. \nG.  Class Member \nAll  African-American current residents  in,  or \napplicants  for,  public housing,  assisted by the ACHA \nand/or HUD,  who  have  been  and  continue to be denied \ndecent,  affordable and  racially integrated public \nhousing opportunities.  [Class  defined by the court in \nthe  Sanders  case  in an  opinion dated October  15,  1992.] \n. \nIV.  PHYSICAL  IMPROVEMENTS  TO  PUBLIC  HOUSING  DBVELOPMENTS  AHD  TBB \nSURROUNDING  NEIGHBORHOODS  TO  ACCOMPLISH  EQUALIZATION \nThe  Department  recognizes  that desegregation of the ACHA's \npublic housing developments  has  been hindered  in the past in \npart by disparities between  the-physical  plant and \nneighborhood  conditions of d~velopments in predominantly \nwhite  as  compared  to those  in predominantly African-American \nneighborhoods.  Therefore,  the parties to this Plan shall \nundertake  consistent with available  resources to equalize \nthe conditions at all public housing developments  and  in \ntheir surrounding neighborhoods.  To  accomplish this goal, \nthe  Plan envisions  the parties to this Plan undertake the \nfollowing  actions: \nA.  Tenant survey \nHOD,  in cooperation with plaintiffs'  counsel  and  the \nACHA,  will prepare and  administer a  comprehensive \nsurvey  of a  statistically significant segment  of the \n4 \n\nACHA's  tenants  and  applicants on both the LIPH  and \nsection a waiting lists  (both  class members  and  non \n- class members)  to assist in determining the  following:  lf<\".\" \n1.  ~he amenities  at some  public housing developments \nneeded  at other public housing developments  to \naccomplish  equalization among  the developments: \n2.  conditions  in the neighborhoods  surrounding public \nhousing  developments  and how  to  improve  those \nconditions: \n3.  how  to motivate tenants  to make  desegregative \nmoves  with  special  attention to elderly African \nAmericans  who  may  have been discouraged  from \napplying  for  elderly public housing:  and \n4.  the amenities that would make  magnet developments \neffective developments. \nB.  Physical  rmprovements  To  PUblic  Housing  Developments \nTo  accomplish the goal  of equalizing the conditions  in \nall public housing developments,  HUO  will  inspect the \npredominately white and  integrated public housing \ndevelopments  and  develop  a  list of amenities  enjoyed by \nthe tenants  at those  developments.  This  list of \namenities will be modified,  based on  the  information \ngathered by the tenant survey.  A final  list of the \namenities  that shall be  provided at all public housing \ndevelopments  will be  provided  to the ACHA. \n1.  Funding  Physical  rmprovements  to  PUblic  Housinq \nDevelopments \nIn making  decisions  on how  to expend  its \nmodernization  funding,  the ACHA  shall prioritize \nproviding the amenities  included  1n  the  final  list \nof  amenities described-above. \n<II \na.  The  Department has  provided the ACHA  with \nComprehensive  Grant  Program  funds  for the \npurpose of modernizing the public housing \ndevelopments within  its jurisdictions.  ACHA \nwill  carry out  its modernization program \naccording to the terms  of  its Voluntary \nCompliance Agreement  (VCA)  of July 29,  1992. \nb.  Any  modernization: plan approved  (subsequent \nto the plan approved pursuant to the VCA) \nshall,  t9 the extent possible,  include the \n5 \n\nabove  list of  amenities  as part of  the \nmodernization  at any  public housing \ndevelopments. \nc.  All  future modernization  funding  decisions \nshall prioritize providing the above  list of \namenities  at the public housing developments \nthat do  not have  them.  The  amenities  shall \nfirst be  provided at all developments  that \nare occupied predominantly by African \nAmericans. \n2.  Housing Quality and Accessibility standards \nIn addition to providing the above  list of \namenities,  the ACHA  will  ensure  that All public \nhousing developments  meet  or exceed Housing \nQuality standards  (HQS)  and  relevant accessibility \nstandards  (24  CFR  §  8.20  et seq.).  Where \nnecessary,  HUO  will provide Comprehensive Grant \nProgram  funding  for the  inclusion of safety and \nsecurity measures,  including  lighting and  fences. \n3.  Maintenance \nThe  ACHA  shall also eliminate all disparities  in \nmaintenance  services  among  the various \ndevelopments  and  shall bring all developments up \nto the highest standard  found  among  the \npredominantly non-African-American developments. \nThis  standard will  be determined by HUO  after a \nreview  of the history of maintenance  services at \nthe\"public housing developments  and  an  on-site \nreview  of the conditions at all developments. \nThis  particular aspect will be  reviewed \nperiodically to ensure  that the  level of  services \nremains  comparable. \nc.  Physical  Improvements  tQ  the  Neighborhoods  surroundinq \nPUblic Housinq Developments  and  Inrrastructure \nImprovements \n1.  General  Neighborhood  Improvements \nIn an  effort to  improve  the vicinity surroundinq \nACHA  family public housing developments,  HOD  will \ndemolish  any vacant buildings  that it now  owns  or \nmay  acquire  in the  future,  it HUO  determines  that: \n(1)  the housing  is not needed:  and  (2)  demolition \nwould  remove  a  source of blight  from  the vicinity. \nIn the neighborhoods  surrounding public housing \ndevelopments,.- HUO  will expedite the repair and/or \n6 \n\nsale of HUD-owned  multifamily and  single  family \nproperty.  If HUD  expects  to be  owner  of  such a \nproperty  for more  than six months,  HUD  will  adopt \n~c \nand  implement  a  ~ection 3  employment  policy to \nprovide  employment  opportunities  for  low-income \nproperty and  neighborhood  residents  in the \nmanagement,  maintenance,  and  rehabilitation of the \nproperties. \nXmprove  Xnfraatructure \nThrough  enforcement of  its cooperation agreement \nwith each municipality  in which  a  PHA \ndevelopments,  is located,  ACHA  will  require the \nmunicipality to serve the  PHA  developments  with \nstreets,  lighting,  and other elements  of public \ninfrastructure to the standard  found  in other \nstable neighborhoods  in the municipality where  a \nPHA  development  is not  located.  In neighborhoods \nsurrounding  PHA  developments,  which  neighborhoods \nshow  signs of deterioration,  ACHA  will require the \nmunicipality to  institute a  program of blight \nremoval  and  code  enforcement to  control  the \nd~terioration.  w~ere appropriate,  the County  will \nassist municipalities  in providing help to low \nincome  homeowners  eligible for  assistance to \nrepair their housing  code violations and  otherwise \nsupport  housing  rehabilitation and  stabilization \nefforts.  To  the extent these obligations exceed  a \nmunicipality's  resources,  it shall apply  to the \nCounty  for  Community  Development  Block Grant \nfunds.  The  County will  set aside  funds  from  the \nnormal  process,  sufficient to support  such \napplications and  to complete the work within five \nyears. \n• \nFurther,  HUD,  the  Plaintiffs,  the County,  and  the \nACHA  will  form  a  Task-~orce to study the \nneighborhoods  in which--historically African \nAmerican  public hodsinq exists.  The  Task Force \nwill  include appropriate private and non-profit \nentities  (including the  Fair Housing Services \nCenter  (FHSC)),  as well  as  other appropriate state \nand Federal  agencies,  to recommend  actions \ndesigned to achieve  a  quality  living environment \nin those communities  and  to make  such communities \nand the public housing they contain more \nattractive and  desirable  for desegregative moves. \nThe Task Force will ba  responsible to make  a \nrecommendation  on  the developments  that will be \ndesignated magnet  developments  (see Section IV. \no.).  .. \n7 \n\nV.  OTHER  MEASURES  DESIGNED  TO  STABILIZE  AND  EQUALIZE  PUBLIC \nHOUSING  DEVELOPMENTS  AND  THE  SURROUNDING  COMMUNITIES \nConcurrent with the  implementation of the equalization \nmeasures  Qescribed  above,  HUD  will  use whatever  authority or \nleverage  is available and  necessa·ry to eliminate to the \nextent possible any  vestiges of discrimination that exist in \nthe ACHA's  assisted housing developments.  The  authority to \nbe utilized includes,  but  is not  limited to,  the authority \nof the Assistant Secretary for  Fair Housing  and  Equal \nOpportunity to  initiate investigations under the  Fair \nHousing Act,  as described  in the Section on  Enforcement  at \nthe conclusion of this document. \nHUD  will  encourage  the appropriate  local  jurisdictions, \nincluding the County,  to target Community  Development Block \nGrant  (CDBG),  HOME,  Comprehensive  Grant  Program  (CGP), \nComprehensive  Improvement  Assistance  Program grants  (CIAP), \nFamily Self-Sufficiency  (FSS),  Section 108,  and  other \nFederal  resources  (e.g.,  funds  from  the Departments  of \nEnergy,  Education,  Transportation,  Labor,  Health  and  Human \nServices,  Agriculture,  etc.)  toward  the goal  of  enhancing \nthe quality of  life in the neighborhoods  with public \nhousing,  including employment  opportunities through the \nimplementation of Section 3.  Targeting  of  funds  available \nunder  any  of the  following  programs  to neighborhoods with \npublic housing will  be  considered:  Enterprise,  Fannie Mae, \nand  low-income  tax credit. \nOther measures  which may  be utilized  include: \nA. \nTranspor~ation \nHOD  will  require the County  to prepare and  to  submit a \nsurvey  summarizing the availability of public \ntransportation to each of the ACHA's  public housing  • \ndevelopments.  This  survey should  indicate the \nfrequer1cy,  cost,  and  routes. of each means  of public \ntransportation serving eac~·development.  If this \nsurvey reveals  a  patter~ of service which  appears to \nencourage  the perpetuation of segregation,  or which \nappears  to provide  inferior service to residents of \nAfrican-American  impacted developments,  ACHA  will \nrequest public transportation providers  to remedy the \ndisparity.  Failure of such providers  to remedy  any \nsuch disparity the ACHA  finds  may  be considered a  basis \nfor  a  secretary-Initiated complaint against the \nproviders  of such transportation. \n8 \n\nB.  Police Protection \nHOD,  the Plaintiffs,  the ACHA  and the County will work \ntogether to ensure  that every public housing \ndevelopment  has adequate  police protection. \n1.  Where  police protection for a  public housing \ndevelopment  is not being provided at levels \ncomparable  to other neighborhoods,  HUD  will \nrequire the ACHA  to enforce the Cooperation \nAgreement  between  it and  the unit of  local \ngovernment  responsible  for  such protection to \nprovide comparable protection to the PHA \ndevelopment.  Where  ACHA  has  difficulty obtaining \nthe  full  cooperation of  the municipality  (or \nCounty)  in providing  equitable police services, \nHOD  will consider whether  the  failure to provide \nsuch police protection may  violate the Fair \nHousing  Act.  Failure to provide  an equal  level of \npolice protection at predominantly African \nAmerican  developments  may  be  considered as a  basis \nfor  a  Secretary-Initiated complaint against the \nmunicipality providing the predominantly African \nAmerican  developments  with  inferior service. \n2.  Where  HUD  considers  it necessary,  HOD  shall \napprove  the decertification of units so  the ACHA \ncan provide space  for police sub-stations at \nfamily  developments  where  a  history of drug  or \ncrime  problems  exist.  Where  sub-stations are \nestablished,  HOD  will  require the ACHA  to \nnegotiate,  under  the Cooperation Agreement,  an \narrangement with the  local  police or the County \nSheriff's Department to staff the sub-stations \nduring those hours. when  a  police presence on-site \nwould  be most  likely to discourage criminal  ' \nactivities. \n3.  The  County will de•elop· and  implement  a  plan to \nensure  adequate police protection at public \nhousing developments  located in municipalities \nthat have  no  police force. \nc.  ADti-Crima  Programs \nHOD  will help ACHA  to identify sources  of  funding  - \nwithin HOD  and  from  other sources  -- for anti-crime \nactivities to be targeted at those  public housing \ndevelopments  where  drug and  crime problems  exist and \nwill  assist ACHA  to actively seek such  funding. \n9 \n\no. \nMaqnet  Developments \n-· \nIn addition to the various physical  improvements \nmentioned  above,  HOD,  in consultation with the \nPlaintiffs and  based on  the  recommendations  of the Task \nForce  (see Section III.  c.  2.),  will,  subject to the \navailability of Federal  appropriations  and  funding  and \nto HUD's  determination  regardinq effectiveness  in \nfurthering desegregation,  propose  at certain \ndevelopments  the  inclusion of additional amenities \ndesigned to act as a  magnet  to attract occupants. \nThese  additional  amenities will be  proposed  for \ndevelopments  where  high vacancy  rates are the result of \nthe  reality or perception of a  high  level of  criminal \nor drug-related activities or there are other  factors \nwhich make  desegregation difficult.  Anti-crime,  anti \ndrug measures,  and  social  service programs  will be \ninstituted,  and where  appropriate,  additional  physical \namenities will be provicled.  An  outreach and  marketing \nprogram will be  implemented  to  reduce  the vacancy  rate. \nB.  Demolition and  Replacement  of Dilapidated Public \nHousing  Units \nThe  ACHA  shall conduct  a  survey of the physical \nconditions of  its family  public housing development \ndevelopments  and  report to HUO  respecting the  condition \nof each building at each development.  If a  majority of \nunits  in any  building  is sufficiently dilapidated, \nparticularly buildings  in high density areas,  that they \nneed  substantial rehabilitation and the building  is in \na  predominantly African-American developments  in a \npredominantly African-American  neighborhood,  the ACHA \nshall  submit to HOD  a  demolition plan  for that \nbuilding,  in accordance with the applicable provisions \nof the United states Housing Act  of 1937  and  its  • \nimplementing  regulations.  HOD  shall consider any  such \nplan as promptly as  possible • \n.., \nIf the replacement  units are to be  new  construction \npublic housing,  the units must,  subject to the \navailability of Federal  appropriations  and  fundinq,  be \nscattered-site housing,  located  in neighborhoods  that \nare not predominantly African-American and  otherwise  in \naccordance with HOD's  site and  neighborhood  standards. \nIn order to achieve these  fair housing  objectives,  the \nCounty  and ACHA  will use their best efforts,  including \nthe expenditure of CDBG  funds,  to ensure that each \nmunicipality that is not predominately African-American \nwill  accept  any  such  family public housing units within \nits jurisdiction in neighborhoods  that are not \npredominately African-American,  by  entering  into a \n10 \n\ncooperation  agreement with the ACHA.  HOD  will monitor \nthe  County's  efforts  in this  regard and  enforce  the \n- county's certification that  it will  affirmatively \nfurther  fair housing. \nIf the replacement units are to be  satisfied through \nHOD  providing  additional  Section 8  certificates or \nvouchers,  the ACHA  will work  closely with the  Fair \nHousing  center to provide counseling and  other fair \nhousing services to the applicants and  recipients of \nthe certificates and vouchers. \nV%.  WAZTZHG  LZST  ZHZTZATrvBS \nThis  Plan authorizes the use  of race-conscious  tenant \nselection and  assignment practices  for all developments  and \nprograms  administered by  the ACHA  in an attempt to attain \nnon-racially identifiable developments.  ACHA  is required to \nimplement  an  education and  outreach.effort to  income \neligible persons  throughout  the County,  to  inform  such \npersons  about  the  availability of housing  opportunities  in \nall areas  of Allegheny county,  including  Pittsburgh and \nMcKeesport.  The  Plan also provides  for the cross-listing \nand merger  of the ACHA  LIPH  and  Section 8  waiting  lists. \nThe  Department  reserves the  right to review the execution of \nthis waiting list initiatives at any  time  after the  first \nyear of  implementation. \nA.  Community Wide  Waiting  List \n1.  Effective  immediately and  until  further  notice, \nthe, ACHA  will utilize a  single Community-Wide \nWafting  List for  its LIPH.  An  applicant who \nreaches  the top of the  single Community-Wide \nWaiting  List shall be  offered the  first available \nunit.  If a  pool  of vacancies  exists when  an  • \napplicant  reaches  the top  of the waiting  list, \nthen the applicant sha}l be offered a  suitable \nunit at a  non-rac~lly _identifiable public housing \ndevelopment,  if such a  unit is available  in the \npool.  Where  there  is more  than one  unit which \nwould  provide a  desegregative housing opportunity, \nthe applicant shall be given a  choice among  such \nunits. \nIf there  is not a  unit in a  development where  the \napplicant's race does  not predominate,  then the \napplicant must  be  offered the  opportunity to \nremain  in place on  th~ single Community-Wide \nWaiting  List and he/she  shall be  offered the next \navailable desegregative housing opportunity unit \nof appropriace  size. \n11 \n\n2.  If the  applicant rejects a  unit that would  have \nprovided the applicant  a  desegregative housing \nopportunity without good  cause,  the applicant will \nbe dropped to the bottom of the  single Community-\n_Wide  Waiting  List and  the date  of the  rejection \nbecomes  his/her application date.  The  ACHA  shall \nnot  offer the applicant another unit until every \nother applicant eligible for the  same  size unit \nwith the same  or earlier application date has  been \noffered an  appropriate unit or has withdrawn his \nor her request,  or six months  has  elapsed  from  the \nrejection of the offer,  whichever time period is \nlonger. \nB.  Housing Opportunities Waiting  Lists \nEffective  immediately,  HUD  will  require the Housing \nAuthority of the  City of Pittsburgh,  the Housing \nAuthority of the City of McKeesport,  and ACHA  to inform \neligible applicants  for  PUblic  Housing  and  Section 8 \nthat they have  a  right to apply  for housing  at the \nother PHAs  and  to  facilitate this application process. \nEach  PHA  will  also provide applicants with a  list ot \nother assisted housing  in Allegheny  County  at the time \nthat the applicant makes  application.  HUD  will provide \nthose  lists to the  PHAs. \nc. \ncross-listing Initiative \nWithin  thirty  (30)  days  of the effective date of this \nPlan,  HUD  shall  require the ACHA  to automatically place \nits publ·ic  housing applicants  on  its Section  8  existing \nhousing~rogram waiting  list,  and  vice versa.  The  ACHA \nshall not  require cross-listed applicants to accept the \ntype of housing  that they did not originally apply \nfor,  should  they  reach.the top  of that waiting list \nfirst.  The ACHA  will  review all current applications \nand  cross-list the eligible applicants on the waiting \nlists of all programs  operated by ACHA  for which the \napplicant  is eligible,  ~y date and  time  of original \napplication and  by  Federal preference.  FUture ACHA \napplicants will need  to complete only one  application \nform  for housing assistance for  all programs \nadministered by the ACHA,  including LIPH  and  Section 8 \nHousing  Certificate and Vouchers. \nSeparate waiting lists will be maintained for each \nprogram.  When  administering the new  cross-listed LIPH \nwaiting list,  the ACHA  wil~ follow  the same  propedures \nset forth  in Section v.  A.  above.  As  vacancies  occur, \nan applicant would be required  to consider vacancies \nfor  any  program  fo•r  which  the applicant is eligible, \n12 \n\nbased upon  his or her position on  the  list.  A refusal \nfor  other than good  cause would  result  in the  applicant \nbeing dropped  to the bottom of that specific program•s \nlist.  However.  such  refusal  would  not  affect the \napplicant•s placement  on  the  list of the  other program \nor programs. \nD.  Transfers \n1.  The  ACHA  will make  available to residents of \npublic housing  the opportunity to transfer between \nhousing  developments  or programs  operated, \nmanaged,  or administered by the PHA,  if such a \ntransfer would  result  in a  desegregated housing \nopportunity  for  that resident.  To  \"make \navailable11  means  to ascertain whether such  a \ntransfer would  offer a  desegregative housing \nopportunity and  to give  notice to  tenants \ndescribing the transfer opportunities and \ninforming  the  tenants  of the  actions  reasonably \nto make  use  of the transfer. \nn~cessary \n2.  Effective  immediately the ACHA  will begin the \nmandatory  transfer of over housed  and underhoused \ntenants.  If a  unit of  appropriate  size  in a \ndevelopment  in which  the tenant•s  race does  not \npredominate  is available,  the tenant will be \nassigned  to that unit.  Where  there  is more  than \none~ unit which would provide  a  desegregative \nhousing  opportunity,  the tenant shall be given a \nchoice  among  such units. \nA good  cause  reason may  be used:  1)  to avert a  • \ntransfer  from  a  development,  but not to avert a \ntransfer to a  smaller.unit within the development: \n2)  to avert a  transfer·to a  smaller unit,  if the \nlarger unit  is ne~essary to afford a  person with a \ndisability an opportunity to use  or enjoy a \ndwelling. \nB.  Merged waitinq List \none  year after the execution of this Plan,  the ACHA \nwill discontinue Cross-listing and  shall merge  the \nsingle Community-Wide  Waiting  List  for  its LIPH  program \nwith other ACHA-administer~d waiting  lists.  If ACHA \n13 \n\nadministers  a  waiting  list for  a  project with project \nbased Section  8  (except  in t.he  case  of project-based \nCertificates),  then the ACHA  shall  notify the  owner  and \ngive the owner  the opportunity  to state any  objection \nto the merger  of the waiting  list. \n1.  The  ACHA  will make  offers  for units  as described \nbelow: \na.  If only  one  public housing unit,  certificate \nor voucher  is available when  an  applicant \nreaches  the  top  of  the merged  waiting  list, \nthen  the applicant  shall  be  offered the unit, \ncertificate or voucher.  An  applicant may \nreject that offer if it is nQt a \ndesegregative housing  opportunity.  The \napplicant must  then be  afforded  the \nopportunity to remain  in place on  the single \nmerged waiting  list and  be  offered the hext \navailable desegregative  housing  opportunity. \n(In order to receive  a  certificate or voucher \nas  his/her desegregative  housing  opportunity, \nan  applicant must  attend mobility counseling \nprovided by  the Fair Housing  Services \nCenter.) \nb.  If a  pool  of vacancies  exists when  an \napplicant  reaches  the  top  of the waiting  list \nand  one  or more  of  the vacancies would \nprovide a  desegregative housing opportunity, \nthen  the applicant  shall be  offered the \ndesegregative·housing opportunity,  if only. \none  exists,  or his/her choice of the \ndesegregative hoUsing  opportunities  if more \nthan  one  exist:s.  (In order to receive a \ncertificate or voucher as his  or her \ndesegregative housing  opportunity,  an \napplicant must  attend mobility counseling \nprovided by  the Fair Housing Services \nCenter.) \nc.  If a  pool  of vacancies  exists when  an \napplicant  reaches  the top of the waiting  list \nand  none  of the vacancies would provide a \ndesegregative housing  opportunity,  then the \n14 \n\napplicant may  choose  either: \n(1)  to remain  in place on the single merged \nwaiting  list for the next  available \ndesegregative  housing  opportunity,  or \n(2)  select among  the available \nopportunities. \n2.  In all  circumstances,  an  applicant who  refuses a \nunit which would  provide  a  desegregative  housing \nopportunity will  be  dropped  to the bottom of the \nmerged  waiting  list and  the date of the  rejection \nbecomes  his/her application date.  The  applicant \nshall not be  offered another unit until  either \nevery  other applicant eligible for the same  size \nunit with the same  or earlier application date has \nbeen  offered an  appropriate unit or has  withdrawn \nhis or her request,  or six months  has  elapsed  from \nthe  rejection of the  offer,  whichever period  is \nlonger. \nP.  Good  cause  Review  Board \nA three-person Good  cause Review  Board  shall be \nestablished to review and  evaluate applicants'  and \ntransferees'  requests  for  good  cause exceptions.  The \nBoard will meet  (or confer telephonically)  weekly  to \ndecide  r,equests  submitted to ACHA.  The  Board will be \nmade  up.\"of  one  designee  from  Neighborhood  Legal \nServices Association  (NLSA),  the Fair Housing  Services \nCenter and  the ACHA.  The  designee must  have  the \nauthority  from  its agency  to make  good  cause \ndeterminations during  the weekly meeting and without \nfurther consultation with  agency. \ni~s \nIn order to make  these~determinations, the ACHA  shall \nprovide each designee  to the  Board  copies of the \napplications and  related materials.  The  Fair Housing \nServices Center,  in conjunction with the ACHA  and the \nNLSA,  will develop guidelines  for  applicants  for good \ncause exceptions. \nThe  ACHA  is responsible  for  insuring that applicants \nand  transferees  requesting good  cause exceptions  fully \nunderstand their obligatiop to provide complete \n15 \n\ninformation  in support  of their applications. \nH.  Affirmative Action waiting List \nIf,  upon  review and  evaluation of  the results of the \nother waiting  list initiatives and  after consultation \nwith  the Plaintiffs,  HUD  finds  that the  initiatives \nhave  proved  insufficient to achieve desegregation,  the \nACHA  shall  implement  an Affirmative Action Waiting \nList.  The  Affirmative Action Waiting  List may  be used \nby the ACHA  to desegregate a  racially identifiable \ndevelopment  (whether predominantly White  or Black) \nlocated in either a  predominantly White,  a \npredominantly  Black,  or a  mixed  neighborhood.  This \nwaiting list process  should be used  only  after \nappropriate  educational  and  outreach efforts and  only \nif,  after 18  months,  the  other waiting list procedures \ndid  not bring about  substantial progress  toward the \nachievement  of the desegregation standard described  in \nthis Plan.  The  Affirmative Action Waiting List would \noperate as  follows: \n1.  Selections  for vacancies  in public housing would \nbe made  from  the single community-wide merged  LIPH \nand Section 8  waiting lists. \n2.  A person of one  race who  is on  the waiting list \nmay.be  substituted  for  a  person  of another race \nwho, is at the top of the list if the  substitution \nwould  accomplish desegregation.  This  substitution \nprocess  would be  repeated as  frequently as \nnecessary to accomplish the objectives of the \nPlan.  For  example;  five  persons  of one  race \nma~ \nbe  substituted in a  group move  for  five  persons of \nanother  race who  were·~t the  top of the list. \nV%%.  HOOSZNG  MOBILITY  PROGRAM \n~ \nA Fair Housing  Services Center  (FHSC),  a  non-profit \ncorporation,  shall be established to provide housing \nmobility  services. \n16 \n\nA.  Non-Profit  corporation \nHUD  shall,  subject to appropriations,  provide FY  9.5 \nfunding1  for  a  competitively  chosen2  local  non-profit \ncorporation to further  fair housing  in Allegheny County \nthrough: \n1.  monitoring the  compliance  of the providers  of  low \nincome  housing  in the County  (including  federally \nsubsidized and  assisted housing)  with the fair \nhousing  laws  and  the  requirements placed upon  such \nproviders  as  a  consequence  of this Plan: \n2.  providing counseling  respecting housing  and \neconomic  development  opportunities to the actual \nand  potential  consumers  of such housing: \n3.  encouraging  and  assisting  in the development  of \ndesegregative housing  opportunities,  including \noutreach to private  landlords  in non-impacted \nareas  and  counseling and  referral  services to \nSection  8  tenants  and  applicants who  wish to \nutilize their Section 8  certificates or housing \nvouchers  in a  desegregative  fashion: \n4.  encouraging and  assisting tenants  and  applicants \nof the ACHA  to make  desegregative moves  within the \nLIPH  program:  and \n.: \n1  Subject to the  availability of appropriations  that could \nlegally be  used  for  the  stated purposes,  HOD  would  agree to fubd \nsuch  a  corporation with  a  staff of  five  for three years. \nIncluded  in such  funding  would  be  su·uicient funds  to rent an \nadequate  office,  should the corp~ation actually need  additional \noffice space to carry out the stated functions  for which HOD \nwould  propose  to  fund  the corporation. \n2  The  corporation would  have  to be competitively chosen, \ni.e.,  it would  have  to  apply  to HUD  for  the money  in response to \na  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  or Notice  of Funding Availability \n(\"NoFA\").  HOD  cannot  create or organize such an  organization. \nIn addition,  HOD  is willing to send  the RFP  or NoFA  directly \nto any  entity plaintiffs suggest. \n17 \n\ns.  encouraging and  assisting class members  to make \n·desegregative moves  to privately owned  assisted \nhousing  programs: \n6.  administering the  200  new  Section 8  desegregative \nvouchers  provided  by  the Office  of  Public  and \nIndian Housing  for  the exclusive use  of those \nclass members  who  agree  to move  to private  rental \nhousing  in neighborhoods  in which  the African \nAmerican  population of  the neighborhood  does  not \nexceed  by  20  percent  the African-American \npopulation of Allegheny  County  as  a  whole, \nexclusive  of the Cities  of Pittsburgh and \nMcKeesport. \nOepanding  on  the source  of  funding,  HUD  shall be \nrequired to  fund  such  a  non-profit  corporation,  only, \nif the corporation meets  the  requirements  of \n(applicable  statute,  regulations.  Handbook.  and/or \nNotice>. \nB.  BUD  Assisted Housinq \nThe  following  sections  describe  the  respective \nfunctions  of the  FHSC  and HUD  in the Housing Mobility \nProgram: \n1.  The:FHSC  shall: \na.  give  each  class member  written notice,  every \nsix months,  in a  form  and  distribution method \nto be  approved by  the court,  of  all HOD \nassisted low \"income  housing  developments  in \nAllegheny  County  that offer class members  a \ndesegregative housing  opportunity: \n.., \nb.  include  in the notice the  full  address, \ntelephone  number,  and  name  of the person \nresponsible  for  accepting applications  for \nthe development,  a  short description of the \ntype  of housing  offered by  the development, \nand  the general  eligibility requirements  for \nthe development.

HUD  will \nnegotiate  sales  of HOD-owned  developments  and \nsingle  family  houses  to  the ACHA  to provide \nhomeownership  opportunities  for  low-income \nhouseholds. \n4.  General  Procedures  To  Improve  ACHA  Administration \nof ACHA's  Section  8  Existing Housing  Program  (11§  8 \n21 \n\nEHP\")  and  To  Provide  Increased Mobility  for ACHA's \n§  a EHP  Participants \na.  To  better assure that Housing  Quality \nStandards  (\"HQSs\")  are enforced  in all units \nwhere  §  a EHP  certificates and  housing \nvouchers  are utilized,  ACHA  will: \n(1)  Either contract with the municipalities \nwhere  such  units  are  located  (or,  if \nappropriate,  Allegheny  County)  (\"the \ncounty\")  to have  initial and  annual \ninspections carried out  by  the municipal \n(or county)  housing  code  staff,  or ACHA \nwill  use  its own  staff or contract with \nstaff of  other  §  a  EHP  programs  to carry \nout the  inspections.  Where  units  are \nfound  to be  in violation of HQS, \nmunicipal,  or County  codes,  steps to \nobtain compliance will  be  taken  in \naccordance with Chapter  5  of HOD \nHandbook  7420.7,  and ACHA  will  request \ncode  enforcement  from  the municipality \nwithin which  the unit  is located  (or the \ncounty). \n(2)  carry out quality review  inspections of \nat least 30  percent  of all units \nutilizing §  a  EHP  assistance within  90 \ndays  of the  initial or annual  inspection \nfor  the  first year  of this Plan's \nimplementation,  20  percent  for  the \nsecond  year,  and  10  percent  for  the \nthird year. \n(3)  carry out perimeter  inspections of all \nunits  utflizing  §  a  EHP  assistance at \nleast twice annually,  noting all obvious \ncode violations on  surrounding \nproperties  and  reporting  them  to the \nappropriate municipal  (or County) \nofficials  for  follow-up  code \nenforcement. \n(4)  Respond  to all  §  a  EHP  tenants  reportinq \ncomplaints  to ACHA  staff about  tpeir \n22 \n\nunits,  buildings,  or complexes  by \nnotifying the owner  or manager  about the \ncomplaint and  asking that person to \naddress  it.  Where  the owner  or manager \ndoes  not address  the  complaint \nappropriately  in a  reasonable  time,  ACHA \nwill take the  steps outlined  for such \nsituations  in Chapter  5  of HUD  Handbook \n7420.7.  A \"reasonable time\"  will be \ndetermined by  the severity of the \ncondition of which the tenant  is \ncomplaining. \n(5)  Provide  a  special  opportunity to each \nfamily  currently participating in the  § \n8  EHP  as of the date of  the \nimplementation  of this Plan  to better \nassure  that the dwelling unit which  it \noccupies meets  HQS  and  local  code  . \nstandards.  Within  30  days  of the date \nof  this  Plan's  implementation,  ACHA  will \nnotify each  §  8  EHP  family  by  letter \nthat  if it believes that the dwelling \nunit  it occupies  does  not meet HQS \nand/or  local  code  standards,  it may: \n(a)  seek from  its landlord the \ncorrection of any dwelling unit \nconditions  it believes violate HQS \nand/or code  standards: \n(b)  if the landlord fails to correct \nth~ reported building deficiencies \nwithin a  reasonable period of time, \nthe  fa~ily may  re~~est the ACHA  to \ninspect-'· the property and  take \nap~opriate actions  to correct any \nviolations  that may  exist:  and \n(c)  if prior to receiving the ACHA's \nnotice,  the  family has  already \nrequested the  landlord to correct \nsuch deficiencies,  the  family may \nrequest the ACHA  inspection without \nfurther communicating with the \nlandlord. \n23 \n\n(6)  Upon  receipt of notice by  a \nparticipating  §  8  EHP  family  that it has \nnotified  its landlord  of  such \ndeficiencies,  ha~ given the  landlord a \nreasonable time  to correct them,  and has \nbeen unsuccessful  in obtaining the \nneeded  corrections,  ACHA  will conduct \nthe requested  inspections within a \nreasonable time  after receipt  of the \nfamily's  request,  but not to exceed  10 \ndays.  The  inspection will be  conducted \nby  an  ACHA  employee  qualified to conduct \ninspections pursuant to HOD  HQS  in \naccordance with the procedures used  for \ninitial HQS  inspections.  If the unit \nfails  to pass  the  inspection,  ACHA  will \ndeal  with the matter as  outlined  in \nChapter  5  of HOD  Handbook  7420.7.  Upon \nreasonable  request,  ACHA  will make \navailable to plaintiffs'  counsel  the \nrequ~sts for  inspection,  the  inspection \nreports,  and  all documents  reflecting \nresolution of  the complaints. \n(7)  To  better assure that  §  8  EHP \nparticipants are  aware  that they  can \nmove  to another dwelling upon  completion \nof one  year's tenancy under their lease, \nACHA  will send  notice of this  fact to \nall current participants.  In addition, \nthe ACHA  will  inform  §  8  EHP \nparticipants about  the availability of \nthe Fair Housing  Center's mobility \ncounseling:  the  availability of ACHA  • \ncounseling ~nd mobility services  (which \nmust  be  provided consistent with HOD \nregulatiens):  and  the names  of three \nlandlords who  will accept  §  8  payment \nand have  an appropriately sized unit \navailable  for  rent in a  non-racially \nimpacted  neighborhood.  The  ACHA  will \nalso provide the above  information to \nall future  1  8  EHP  participants. \n(8)  ACHA  will conduct  a  public  information \nand  outreach program to landlords with \n24 \n\nunits  !n Allegheny  County,  including  -~ \nlandlords  owning  properties  in areas \nwhere  few  or no  properties currently \nparticipate,  to make  those  landlords \naware  of the  rental opportunities \navailable under ACHA's  §  8  EHP. \n(9)  In order to comply with  this Plan,  each \nyear ACHA  will  use  every good  faith \neffort to have  a  substantial percentage \nof  its §  8  EHP  participants use their \nassistance outside neighborhoods  which \nare  racially-identifiable. \nc.  New  Section a vouchers \nThe  Office of  Public  and  Indian Housing will  allocate a \nmaximum  of  200  desegregative  Section 8  vouchers  for the \nexclusive use  of those  class members  who  agree to move \nto private rental housing  in neighborhoods  in whH::h  the \nAfrican-American population  of  the neighborhood  dcEs \nnot  exceed by  20  percent the African-American \npopulation of Allegheny  County  as  a  whole,  exclusive of \nthe Cities of  Pittsburgh and  McKeesport.  Non-class \nmembers  will be  eligible  for the ACHA's  other programs, \nincluding  its non-deseqregative vouchers  and \ncertificates. \nUpon  request,  HUD  will  consider  for  the Allegheny \nCounty market  area,  whether  granting an  exception to \nthe  Fair Market  Rents  levels  for certificates and/or \npayment  standards  for housing vouchers,  pursuant to 24 \nC.F.R.  §§  882.106(a) (31  and  887.35l(b) (2),  (1990 \nEdition)  respectively,  would  increase the opportunity \nof class members  who  sought housing  through the  §  8  EHP \nto obtain  a  desegregated  hotising  opportunity,  and,  if \nso  and  otherwise consistent with HUD  regulations,  shall \ngrant such an  exception. \n25 \n\nVIII.  ENFORCEMENT \nThe  Department  shall establish an  effective monitoring and \nenforcement process  to  include  a  standardized approach  for \ncomprehensive  and  consistent recordkeeping and  reporting. \nThe  ACHA  will be  required  reqularly to report its \nperformance on  each of the elements  of the Plan.  The \nresponsibility for monitoring the ACHA's  performance  is \nassigned  to the Mid-Atlantic Regional  FHEO  Enforcement \ncenter.  The  Office will  be  provided  sufficient resources \nfor monitoring  in Allegheny  County,  funding  for  travel to \ndevelopments,  data analysis,  and  evaluation. \nA.  schedule For  Plan  Implementation \nIf not  otherwise  specified,  an  implementation schedule \nshall be devised  for  every  Plan  element  contained \nherein.  The  schedule shall  set deadlines that are \nappropriate  to each type  of  remedial measure  and  ensure \ntheir completion  in a  prompt  fashion.  The  maximum \nimplementation period  for  any  plan element  shall not \nexceed  seven  years  after the date of plan amendment \napproval. \nB.  Reporting Requirements \nThe  ACHA  will  be  required  to  submit to the Mid-Atlantic \nFHEO  Enforcement  Center quarterly reports,  the  format \nof which,will  be established upon  execution of this \nPlan.  · \nc. \nAlternative Actions \nIf the ACHA  does  not agree to  follow  this Plan or fails \nto implement  this Plan as  approved  by  the court,  the \nDepartment  can take  any  or all of the  following \nalternative actions at ~he behest of the Court.  These \nactions  include: \n1.  Declarations of breach under the ACHA's  Annual \nContributions Contract: \n2.  Debarment  proceedings  against the ACHA \ndirector(s),  officer(s),  and/or other employee(s) \nresponsible  for such  failure pursuant to 24  CFR \n24.305(d) (1)  and  24  CFR  24.705(a)(8): \n26 \n\n3.  Withholding or conditioning  funding  awarded under \nvarious  Departmental  programs  such as \n·comprehensive  Improvement  Assistance Program or \nthe Comprehensive  Grant  Program: \n4.  Referral  of the matter to the  Department  of \nJustice  for appropriate  action:  and \n5.  Commencement  of  a  Secretary-Initiated Title VIII \ncomplaint against the ACHA. \nIn addition,  when  HOD  determines  that the city or \nlocality where  an ACHA  development  is located  (or may \nbe  located)  is impeding  the progress  of  an  ACHA  in \nimplementing  the provisions  of this Plan,  HUD  will \ninstitute appropriate  actions against that city,  State \nor other entities  including,  but not  limited to, \nwithholding  or conditioning Departmental  funds  under \nthe  CDBG  and/or other applicable programs,  or the. \ncommencement  of a  Secretary-Initiated complaint under \nthe  Fair Housing Act. \nD.  BUD  Monitorinq of Federally Subsidized Proqrams \nHUD  will  continue to monitor ACHA's  compliance with  its \nHOD  approved  Tenant  Selection and  Assignment  Plan \n(TSAP)  and  the VCA.  The  Department,  in cooperation \nwith state and  local  fair housing  enforcement \norganizations,  will continue  to enforce Title VI  of the \nCivil Rfghts  Act  of 1964,  Executive Order  11063, \nSection 109  of the Housing  and  community  Development \nAct  of  1974,  Section 504  of  the Rehabilitation Act  of \n1973,  Section 3  of the_Housing  and Urban  Development \nAct  of 1968,  and  other civil  rights  statutes \nadministered by  this \nDepa~~ent. \nB.  Other Enforcement Aotiv!ty \nHUD  will utilize its lawful  authority to enforce the \nFair Housing Act  and  thus to seek to remedy  any \ndiscriminatory treatment  in housing and  housing  related \nrights which  might  affect tenants of the ACHA's \ndevelopments.  Upon  receivinq notice of an  indication \nof possible discriminatory treatment  or policies,  HOD \nwill make  available FHEO  personnel  who  will conduct a \npreliminary  inquiry to determine whether a  Secretary-\n27 \n.. \n\nInitiated  investigation  is warranted.  Where  the \npreliminary  inquiry  indicates that discrimination based \nupon .race,  color,  religion,  sex,  familial  status,  or \nhandicap,  has  had  an  adverse  affect upon  tenants  of and \napplicants to the ACHA's  developments,  the Assistant \nSecretary  for  Fair Housing  and  Equal  Opportunity will \ninitiate a  Title VIII  complaint  and  seek redress  for \nthe discrimination. \nThe  areas  in which  the Department will  consider the use \nof the Secretary-Initiated complaint  as a  tool  for the \nelimination of discrimination  include but are not \nlimited to those  listed below: \n1.  Provision of  Police Protection \nHUD  recognizes  that police protection  is a  housing \nrelated municipal  service which  must  be  provided \nwithout  regard to race,  color,  religion,  national \norigin,  familial  status  or  If HUD \nhandic~p. \nreceives  information  indicating that tenants of \nACHA  housing  are  receiving police services which \nare  inferior to those provided to persons  living \nin the  surrounding  community,  HOD  will  investigate \nto determine whether  this disparity in services \nhas a  racial or other prohibited basis. \n2.  Availability of Developments  for the Construction \nof ~ew Federally-Assisted Housing \nIn the past,  the ACHA  has  sought  to construct new \nfederally-assisted housing  and met with  opposition \nfrom  municipal  governments  and  community  groups •• \nUpon  receipt of  information  indicating that \nopposition to the placement of proposed  new \nfederally-assisted.,housing may  be based upon \nracial or other prohibited bases,  HUD  will conduct \na  preliminary  inquiry.  If this  inquiry supports \nthat the opposition has  a  prohibited basis,  the \nAssistant Secretary for  Fair Housing  and  Equal \nOpportunity will  initiate a  Title VIII  complaint \nagainst the parties opposing the housing  for \ndiscriminatory  reasons  and will  seek redress  for \nthe persons aggrieved by the opposition. \n28 \n\nIX.  HOUSING  OPPORTUNITIES  ANALYSIS \nIn  an  effort to better ensure  that class members  may  have \nhousing  opportunities  in predominately white neighborhoods \nwhich  do  not have  a  concentration of assisted housing and \nthat are comparable with the number  of housing  opportunities \nin predominately African-American  neighborhoods  and/or \npredominately white neighborhoods  which  do have \nconcentration of  assisted housing,  HUD  will conduct  a  study \nof all assisted housing  in Allegheny County.  After an \nanalysis  of the  results of this study,  HUD  will  determine  if \nthere  is a  need  to provide additional  assisted housing  in \nsuch neighborhoods  to provide desegregative housing \nopportunities. \n29 \n\nCERTIFICATE  OF  SERVICB \n.rr.-\nI  hereby  certify that I  have,  this~ day  of April,  1994, \nserved by  the manner  indicated,  the  foregoing  Notice of Filing of \nDepartment  of Housing  and Urban  Development's  Desegregation  Plan \nfor Allegheny  County  on  counsel  of record  for  the parties at the \naddresses  listed below. \nThomas  Henderson,  Esquire  (by  hand) \nLawyers  Committee  for \nCivil Rights  Under  Law \nSuite  400,  1400  I  Street,  N.W. \nWashington,  DC  20005 \nDonald  Driscoll,  Esquire  (by  Federal  Express) \nNeighborhood  Legal  Services \nAssociation \n928  Penn  Avenue \nPittsburgh,  PA  15222 \no. \nByron  Xides,  Esquire  (by  Federal  Express) \nSolicitor,  Allegheny  County \n300  Fort Pitt Commons \n445  Fort  Pitt Boulevard \nPittsburgh,  PA  15219 \nJohn  T.
