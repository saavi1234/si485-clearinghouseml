In addition to disputing the propriety of \ncertifying this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23, \n1 \n \n\n \n \nYoung v. Pierce, 544 F.Supp. 1010 (1982)   \n \n \nF.R.Civ.P.,  defendant  HUD  has  raised  a  variety  of  No  person  in  the  United  States \nquestions which logically precede the Rule 23 inquiry.  shall, on the ground of race, color \nSpecifically, defendant contends, first, that plaintiffs do  or  national  origin,  be  excluded \nnot have a cause of action against HUD under Title VI.  from  participation  in,  denied  the \nSecond, defendant argues that plaintiffs have standing  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \nonly to bring suit against the local housing authorities  discrimination under any program \nwhich allegedly have denied them housing on the basis of  or  activity  receiving  Federal \nrace. HUD first advanced its standing contention in a  financial assistance. \nmotion to dismiss filed May 6, 1980. This motion was \ndenied on May 13, 1980. Shortly thereafter, HUD filed a \nMotion for Reconsideration of this order, in which it \nTitle VI further creates an administrative mechanism, by \nelaborated on its thesis that plaintiffs lack standing to \nwhich federal funding agencies are required to implement \nchallenge HUD’s practices in East Texas. In addition, \nthis  plain  principle  of  equality.  The  Act  directs  each \nHUD  has  filed  three  lengthy  briefs  challenging  the \nfederal funding agency to effectuate the provisions of s \nstanding of plaintiffs, as well as the maintainability of this \n2000d, by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general \naction as a class action.

In  complex  actions  such  as  this,  this  been  an  express  finding  ...  of  a \ncoalescence is understandable. Nonetheless, the issues are  failure  to  comply  with  (the) \ndistinct and must be analyzed separately. Accordingly, the  requirement  (of \nthreshold issues of private right of action and standing  non-discrimination). \nwill be addressed before the requirements of Rule 23. \n  \n \n  Further, s 2000d-1 sets forth the procedure by which such \nfunding termination may be accomplished. \n  \nIt has been clearly held that s 2000d creates a private right \nI.  of action against recipients of federal funding who do not \ncomply with the underlying principle of equality.

It is further \n  \nFootnotes \n \n1  The action was initially brought by Young and Wyatt against HUD and the Clarksville Housing Authority. On March \n  15, 1982, plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The amended complaint seeks to \nadd Helen Ruth Jackson as a named plaintiff; additionally, plaintiffs seek to join the Housing Authority of Pittsburg, \nTexas, as a defendant. (Jackson is a resident of Pittsburg.) For reasons set forth in this order, the motion for leave to \namend will be granted. See Rule 15(a), F.R.Civ.P. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1968) \n(leave to amend should be liberally granted). \nThe housing programs involved in this action are actually of three kinds-public housing, rent supplement programs, \nand Section 8 housing. The content of these three programs is discussed at length in this order. Infra, at pp. \n1027-1028. \n \n2  At different points in the record of this action, plaintiffs have stated they are representing residents of 36, 38 and 39 \n  counties. It appears that the proper scope of the action involves housing authorities in the following 36 counties: \nAnderson, Angelina, Bowie, Camp, Cass, Cherokee, Delta, Franklin, Gregg, Hardin, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, \nHouston, Jasper, Jefferson, Lamar, Liberty, Marion, Morris, Nacogdoches, Newton, Orange, Panola, Polk, Red River, \nRusk, Sabine, St. Augustine, Shelby, Smith, Titus, Tyler, Upshur, Van Zandt and Wood. Plaintiffs contend there are \n111 racially identifiable housing projects in these counties that receive federal funding. \n \n3  In Cannon v. University of Chicago, the Supreme Court found that a private right of action exists under Title IX of the \n  Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. s 1681. The conclusion was reached by application of the factors \nmandated in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). Cannon in no way settles the question of \nwhether a private right of action against the federal funding agency is precluded by a statutorily authorized \nadministrative complaint process. At most, Cannon holds that there is no private right to participate in the actual \nadministrative decision concerning defunding under s 2000d-1. The court in N.A.A.C.P. milks footnote 41 of Cannon \nfor far more than it is worth. \n18 \n \n\n \n \nYoung v. Pierce, 544 F.Supp. 1010 (1982)   \n \n \n \n4  HUD attempts to dismiss these three holdings as “pre-Cannon,” and therefore not binding. There is, of course, no \n  reason to assume that Cannon overruled these cases, sub silentio ; nor may it be said, in any sense, that the internal \nreasoning of the Cannon decision undermines the logic of the three cases cited here. If HUD is to contend that these \ndecisions are without value, they should support their contention with argument, rather than summary citations. \n \n5  For discussion of Adams v. Richardson, see below, at p. 1024. \n \n \n6  A finding that a private right of action exists under a particular decision does not, without more, entail a finding that \n  the action in question is properly brought. Additionally, the plaintiffs must establish that they are the proper parties \nto bring the action. This demonstration may be placed under the general rubric of standing. In particular, plaintiffs \nmust establish that they are among the class of persons for whose benefit the statute was passed. The standing \ndoctrine, and its application to this action, are discussed at length, below, at pp. 1019-1025. \n \n7  HUD’s contentions in this relation have been extremely idiosyncratic. HUD has maintained that the action is too \n  broad, in that it is not confined to one local housing authority; that the action is too narrow, because it is not \nnation-wide; and that it is too narrow, because it does not conform to a particular geographical region of HUD. Only \nthe last of these three arguments merits response. There is no reason that plaintiffs should be compelled to fashion \ntheir action in a manner that coincides with the administrative convenience of HUD. The proper scope of the action \nis to be governed by two considerations: the requirements of Rule 23 concerning commonality and typicality; and \nthe nature of any relief to be granted. Though no arguments in this relation have been made, it might be true, for \ninstance, that the structure of the housing market varies so substantially within the so-called “Region VI” of HUD \nthat a class action concerning that entire region might be impracticable under the terms of Rule 23(a). For example, \nas the area of school desegregation has made clear, what constitutes racial identifiability is heavily contingent on \nthe  demographical  patterns  of  the  area.  It  seems  plain  that  the  problems  of  South  Texas  with  respect  to \nfederally-assisted housing differ markedly from those of East Texas. In any event, the nature of the plaintiff class is \nthe central determinant of the proper scope of the class action. Of course, a court retains plenary power to \nsupervise the litigation of the class action, to insure the interests of the class are protected. Johnson v. Uncle Ben’s, \nInc., 628 F.2d 419 (5th Cir. 1981), vacated on other grounds, 451 U.S. 902, 101 S.Ct. 1967, 68 L.Ed.2d 290 (1981). \n \n8  Again, it should be stressed that this discussion concerns standing to bring an action; the propriety of a class action \n  of this nature additionally is contingent on the requirements of Rule 23; most particularly here, the prerequisites of \ncommonality and typicality. \n \n9  The phrase used here, “a common question of fact and/or law” is admittedly ambiguous. The ambiguity is the result \n  of a recent Supreme Court decision concerning the nature of final determinations made by a trial court in actions \nchallenging employment discrimination under Title VII. In Pullman- Standard v. Swint, —- U.S. ——, 102 S.Ct. 1781, \n72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982), the Court held that a trial court’s finding with respect to discriminatory intent was a “pure \nquestion of fact.” At ——, 102 S.Ct. at 1789. The effect of this holding is not plain. It seems clear that a conclusion by \na trial court that HUD had violated s 2000d, s 3608, or the Constitution in its actions with respect to housing would \n19 \n \n\n \n \nYoung v. Pierce, 544 F.Supp. 1010 (1982)   \n \n \nbe a conclusion of law. The component parts of such a conclusion, concerning the specific action or inaction, and \nalso the effect and intent of HUD’s behavior, would seem to be factual findings. Beyond this simple polarity, the \nimport of the Court’s decision in Swint is not discernible. However, in view of the present discussion, the matter \nneed not be resolved presently. It is sufficient to say that the basic claims of the named plaintiffs share a high degree \nof commonality with those of the class generally. \n \n10  HUD has argued strenuously that this class action is not properly maintainable because HUD’s involvement in \n  housing programs is likely to vary greatly from town to town. HUD cites two major reasons for these alleged \nvariations: the different programs involved, and the likelihood that HUD efforts to monitor compliance with Title VI \nwill be at different stages. Neither of these arguments have merit. See pp. 1030-1031, (variations in programs), and \npp. 1024-1025 (different stages of compliance monitoring). \n \n11  HUD has argued that class certification is not necessary, because the benefits of any injunctive relief against HUD \n  would inure to all residents of the effected area, even in the absence of class certification. This argument is \nfrivolous, in that it seems flatly to contradict the explicit provisions of Rule 23(b)(2), rendering cases involving \ninjunctive relief for the class specifically appropriate for class certification. \n \n12  HUD has contended that plaintiff Wyatt is not a suitable class representative because she no longer lives in \n  Clarksville. At the class certification hearing, counsel for the plaintiff class represented that Ms. Wyatt moved out of \nClarksville as a matter of desperation, because she could not find housing within that city. No factual finding in this \nrelation may be made at this time; for present purposes, it is sufficient that Wyatt resides in East Texas, and \napparently is eligible for, and has applied for, HUD assisted housing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n ",

Martinez, et al.:  1 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 2 of 12 PageID #:  844\nFinal Judgment, and replacing all other remedial orders in this Action. \nThe hearing on the joint motion for approval of the modifications was held on January \n8, 2004. At that hearing the objection by the Martin Luther King, Jr. Regional \nCommunity Development Center of East Texas, Inc. [the Center] to the proposed \nmodifications was heard. The Center admits that it is not a class member. Defendant \nHUD's objection to the Center's standing is granted. \nThe attorney for the Center also filed objections by several class members at the hearing. \nThese objections were form objections and consisted either of a complaint that the class \nmembers did not receive notice of the proposed modifications or a complaint about the \nnotice combined with the same objections to the modifications posed by the Center. \nBased on the Declaration of William J. Daley, Regional Counsel for HUD, that the \nnotices were mailed to the last known address of all African American applicants for and \nresidents of HUD-assisted public housing from 1992 to the present, the Court finds that \nthe notice was adequate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The Court finds that, based on the \nresponses of plaintiffs and HUD to the objections of the Center, the objections of the \nclass members do not justify rejection of the proposed modifications. \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows: \nPart I:  RELIEF TO THE PLAINTIFF CLASS \n1.  On and after March 28, 2003 HUD will create 1,500 desegregated housing \nopportunities (DHOs) for class members in non-minority census blocks in the class \naction area, which DHOs shall be in addition to the DHOs created prior to that date. \nThe class action area consists of the East Texas counties identified in the liability ruling \nYoung, et al. v. Martinez, et al.:  2 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 3 of 12 PageID #:  845\nat 628 F. Supp. 1037, 1040 n. 1, except that for purposes of achieving the 1,500 DHOs \nspecified herein,  Nacogdoches County will not be regarded as part of the class action \narea. \n2.  On and after March 28, 2003, all DHO placements will be counted towards the \nfinal goal of accomplishing the 1,500 DHOs described in 111, above.  Upon completion of \nthose DHOs, the parties agree that this litigation will be terminated and the parties shall \nsubmit a joint motion to dismiss the case with prejudice at that time.  All DHO Section 8 \nHousing Assistance Program (HAP) agreements entered into by class members on or \nafter March 28, 2003 will count toward the final 1,500 DHO goal. \n3.  HUD will provide to the Fair Housing Services Center (\"FHSC\") additional \nfunding at the rate of $40,000 per month during the balance of the current five-year \ngrant, beginning with the month of April 2003 and ending on December 3, 2003, which \nis the expiration date for the current grant.  In addition, HUD will execute an amended \ngrant agreement, a copy of which is attached to the Stipulation as Exhibit 1, that will \nprovide funding for the FHSC for the period 12/4/03-12/3/05 at the rate of $900,000 \nper year.  The parties agree that the FHSC shall focus its mobility counseling, landlord \nrecruitment, and other efforts on DHO  placements in the following East Texas counties \nduring the balance of its grant:  Jefferson, Orange, Bowie, Houston, Angelina, Harrison \nand Lamar.  Implementation of the amended FHSC grant agreement shall be in \naccordance with the amended FHSC management plan which is attached to the \nStipulation as Exhibit 2, and which is hereby approved by the Court. \n4.  HUD agrees to continue the Desegregated Housing Opportunity Program \nYoung, et al. v. Martinez, et al.:  3 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 4 of 12 PageID #:  846\n(DHOP) it adopted on or about March 14,2002, to assist in placement of the 1,500 \nvouchers referenced in ~ 1, above.  Implementation of the DHOP shall be governed by \nthe Desegregated Housing Opportunity Guide, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3 \nto the Stipulation.  Under the DHOP, the East Texas Housing Authorities that are \nidentified as DHO Program Housing Authorities (DHOPHAs) provide mobility \ncounseling, class member assistance payments, and landlord incentives for the benefit of \nclass members throughout the East Texas class action area.  As part of the DHOP, HUD \nhas established exception payment standards for the East Texas class action area \ncounties.  Class members who do not request mobility counseling from the FHSC may \nrequest and receive mobility counseling from the respective DHOPHAs.  HUD's \nobligation to continue the DHOP shall terminate when the DHO requirement specified \nin ~ 1, above, has been satisfied. \n5.  The FHSC and the DHOPHAs will participate in the placement and mobility \ncounseling processes. \n6.  For purposes of this Order, HUD shall receive credit for the creation of a DHO \nwhenever, on and after March 28,2003, an African-American resident of, or applicant \nfor, low-rent public housing in East Texas, uses a Section 8 housing voucher to lease a \nhousing unit in any neighborhood designated as non-racially impacted on the current, \ncourt-approved neighborhood maps, or otherwise designated as non-racially impacted \nby agreement of the parties, except that no DHO credit will be received for placements in \nhousing units located in Nacogdoches County.  The parties agree that the Nacogdoches \nHousing Authority will no longer participate in the DHOPHA process.  The parties \nYoung, et al. v. Martinez, et al.:  4 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 5 of 12 PageID #:  847\nfurther agree that neither the plaintiffs nor HUD will request any modification or \nrevision to the current court-approved neighborhood maps. \n7.  HUD shall receive credit for the creation of a DHO whenever the criteria specified \nin ~ 6, above, have been met, regardless of whether the class member received mobility \ncounseling from the FHSC or a DHOPHA, and without regard to whether the housing \nunit was obtained through a referral from the FHSC or a DHOPHA. \n8.  A class member who uses a Section 8 voucher to lease a unit in a non-minority \nneighborhood shall retain the ability to use that voucher to lease another unit in a non-\nminority neighborhood in the class action area, and to receive the Section 8 exception \npayment standard applicable to the area in which the class member will be residing. \nHowever, class members making such subsequent moves will not receive class member \nincentive payments unless the parties agree that the subsequent move satisfies the \napplicable criteria for the creation of a DHO, in which case HUD will receive DHO credit \nfor the subsequent move. \n9.  The parties agree that all PHAs (including the Nacogdoches Housing Authority) \nhave met their public housing equalization obligations under the Final Judgment. \n10.  The parties agree that HUD shall continue to monitor the following housing \nauthorities for compliance with public housing program requirements, Section 8 \nhousing voucher choice requirements, and desegregation plan requirements: \nBeaumont \nPort Arthur \nOrange County (pending disposition of its housing projects) \nYoung. et al. v.

The parties agree that the only additional requirement for all other housing \nauthorities in the class action area (including the Nacogdoches Housing Authority) is to \ncooperate with HUD's DHOP in order to create the 1500 desegregated housing \nopportunities required by this Order. HUD's obligation to monitor these housing \nauthorities under the terms of this Order shall terminate when the DHO requirement \nspecified in ~ 1 above has been satisfied. \n11.  HUD shall prepare a written report, on a monthly basis, indicating the total \nnumber of DHOs created by the East Texas Fair Housing Services Center and the \nDHOPHAs during the preceding month. \nHUD shall also prepare a written report, on a quarterly basis, describing for the quarter \nin question the monitoring activities undertaken pursuant to ~ 10, above, and indicating \nthe status of the remaining neighborhood equalization projects being undertaken \npursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Release which was previously entered into by \nthe Plaintiffs, HUD and the State of Texas, and which was filed with this Court action on \nMarch 20, 2003. \nThe above-described reports shall be submitted by HUD to Plaintiffs' counsel until such \nYoung, et al. v.

If the DHO placement process is completed prior to the end of the two-year \nextension of the FHSC contract, the parties agree that the FHSC will continue to \nperform post-placement counseling and other activities within the scope of the grant \nagreement. If the DHO placement process is not completed prior to the end of the two-\nyear extension of the FHSC contract, the parties agree that the DHOPHAs will continue \noperating, and the litigation will continue until the 1,500 DHOs described in ~ 1, above, \nhave been achieved.  In the event that such an extension of DHOPHA activities occurs, \nthere will be no further extension of the FHSC grant. \n13.  This Order modifies the Final Judgment and Decree by eliminating therefrom the \nfollowing requirements: \n1)  Waiting list initiatives (Final Decree, Section III) \n2)  Computerized tracking system, reporting and monitoring (Final Decree, Section \nVII) \n3)  Racially hostile site (Final Decree, Section V).  The parties agree that the \ndevelopments in Vidor and Bridge City will be sold. \n4)  Area Wide Housing Opportunity Program (AHOP) (required by the Golden \nTriangle Desegregation Plans) \n5)  Order of Offers (Final Decree, Paragraph II.l) \n6)  DHO Placement numbers per community (Final Decree, Paragraphs 11.2, 11.3, & \nYoung, et al. v. Martinez, et al.:  7 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 8 of 12 PageID #:  850\n7)  Project-Based Section 8 (Final Decree, Paragraph 11.5) \nThe parties further agree that this Order modifies the Final Judgment and Decree as \nspecifically provided herein and supercedes all other remedial orders entered in this \nAction. \nPart II: Conditions and Release and Termination of the Litigation \n14.  Nothing in this Order shall be construed to require HUD to provide additional \nfunding, other than that which is expressly agreed to herein. HUD's duty to discharge \nthe obligations imposed upon it by the express terms of this Order is subject to: (a) the \navailability of funding from Congress for any purpose for which funding is required; \nand (b) the existence of statutory authority for the acts necessary for HUD's \nperformance of its obligations under this Order.  HUD shall not be found to be in \nviolation of this Order on account of any failure to perform any obligation imposed upon \nHUD by the terms of this Order that results: (i) from the unavailability of funding from \nCongress necessary for performance, or (ii) from the modification of revocation of \nstatutory authority that is necessary for such performance by HUD.  If HUD does not \nprovide the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, & 10 of this Order, then HUD's \nobligations under this Stipulation and Order shall not be deemed complete and plaintiffs \nshall be entitled to seek a court order requiring additional relief from HUD but which \nshall be limited to such relief as the Court shall determine to be necessary and \nappropriate to provide the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, & 10 of this \nOrder.  HUD shall be entitled to oppose any such motion for additional relief. \n15.  Upon provision of the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, & 10 of this \nYoung, et al. v. Martinez, et al.:  8 \nOrder Modifying Final Judgment \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 790    Filed 01/13/04   Page 9 of 12 PageID #:  851\nOrder, the plaintiffs and all of the class members, and each of them, and their heirs, \nadministrators, successors, or assigns (together, the \"Plaintiffs\"), shall be deemed to \nhave released and forever discharged HUD and any component, division, agency, or \nestablishment of HUD, and all current and former HUD officials administrators, \nemployees, agents, attorneys, or successors thereof (together the \"Defendants\"), from \nany and all claims and causes of action, known or unknown, which plaintiffs have, or \ncould have asserted, by reason of, with respect to, in connection with, or which arise out \nof, any of the matters alleged at any time in this Action, including, without limitation, \nany claim of race-based discrimination in housing programs funded by HUD, and any of \nthe matters alleged in the Complaint, the Amended Complaint, or in any other pleading, \nmotion, or other paper served or filed by plaintiffs, which the plaintiffs or any of them \nhave against the Defendants or any of them. \n16.  Upon provision of the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, & 10 of this \nOrder, the plaintiffs and all of the class members and each of them, shall be forever \nbarred and enjoined from prosecuting any claims or causes of action that are described \nin ~ 15, above. \n17.  Nothing contained in this Order shall: \nA.

On and after March 28, 2003 HUD will create 1,500 desegregated housing \nopportunities (DHOs) for class members in non-minority census blocks in the class action \narea, which DHOs shall be in addition to the DHOs created prior to that date.  The class \naction area consists of the East Texas counties identified in the liability ruling at 628 F. \nSupp. 1037, 1040 n. 1, except that for purposes of achieving the 1,500 DHOs specified \nherein,  Nacogdoches County will not be regarded as part of the class action area. \n2.  On and after March 28, 2003, all DHO placements will be counted towards the \nfinal goal of accomplishing the 1,500 DHOs described in ~ 1, above.  Upon completion of \nthose DHOs, the parties agree that this litigation will be terminated and the parties shall \nsubmit a joint motion to dismiss the case with prejudice at that time.  All DHO Section 8 \nHousing Assistance Program (HAP) agreements entered into by class members on or after \nMarch 28, 2003 will count toward the final 1,500 DHO goal. \n3.  HUD will provide to the Fair Housing Services Center (\"FHSC\") additional \nfunding at the rate of $40,000 per month during the balance of the current five-year grant, \nbeginning with the month of April 2003 and ending on December 3, 2003, which is the \nexpiration date for the current grant.  In addition, HUD will execute an amended grant \nagreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, that will provide funding for \n2 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 3 of 81 PageID #:  568\nthe FHSC for the period 12/4/03-12/3/05 at the rate of $900,000 per year.  The parties \nagree that the FHSC shall focus its mobility counseling, landlord recruitment, and other \nefforts on DHO placements in the following East Texas counties during the balance of its \ngrant:  Jefferson, Orange, Bowie, Houston, Angelina, Harrison and Lamar. \nImplementation of the amended FHSC grant agreement shall be in accordance with the \namended FHSC management plan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2, and which is \nhereby submitted for the approval of the Court. \n4.  HUD agrees to continue the Desegregated Housing Opportunity Program (DHOP) \nit adopted on or about March 14, 2002, to assist in placement of the 1,500 vouchers \nreferenced in ~ 1, above.  Implementation of the DHOP shall be governed by the \nDesegregated Housing Opportunity Guide, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit \n3.  Under the DHOP, the East Texas Housing Authorities that are identified as DHO \nProgram Housing Authorities (DHOPHAs) provide mobility counseling, class member \nassistance payments, and landlord incentives for the benefit of class members throughout \nthe East Texas class action area.  As part of the DHOP, HUD has established exception \npayment standards for the East Texas class action area counties.  Class members who do \nnot request mobility counseling from the FHSC may request and receive mobility \ncounseling from the respective DHOPHAs.  HUD's obligation to continue the DHOP \nshall terminate when the DHO requirement specified in ~ 1, above, has been satisfied. \n5.  The FHSC and the DHOPHAs will participate in the placement and mobility \ncounseling processes. \n6.  For purposes of this Settlement Stipulation and Order, HUD shall receive credit \n3 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 4 of 81 PageID #:  569\nfor the creation of a DHO Whenever, on and after March 28, 2003, an African-American \nresident of, or applicant for, low-rent public housing in East Texas, uses a Section 8 \nhousing voucher to lease a housing unit in any neighborhood designated as non-racially \nimpacted on the current, court-approved neighborhood maps, or otherwise designated as \nnon-racially impacted by agreement of the parties, except that no DHO credit will be \nreceived for placements in housing units located in Nacogdoches County.  The parties \nagree that the Nacogdoches Housing Authority will no longer participate in the DHOPHA \nprocess.  The parties further agree that neither the plaintiffs nor HUD will request any \nmodification or revision to the current court-approved neighborhood maps. \n7.  HUD shall receive credit for the creation of a DHO whenever the criteria specified \nin ~ 6, above, have been met, regardless of whether the class member received mobility \ncounseling from the FHSC or a DHOPHA, and without regard to whether the housing \nunit was obtained through a referral from the FHSC or a DHOPHA. \n8.  A class member who uses a Section 8 voucher to lease a unit in a non-minority \nneighborhood shall retain the ability to use that voucher to lease another unit in a non \nminority neighborhood in the class action area, and to receive the Section 8 exception \npayment standard applicable to the area in which the class member will be residing. \nHowever, class members making such subsequent moves will not receive class member \nincentive payments unless the parties agree that the subsequent move satisfies the \napplicable criteria for the creation of a DHO, in which case HUD will receive DHO credit \nfor the subsequent move. \n9.  The parties agree that all PHAs (including the Nacogdoches Housing Authority) \n4 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 5 of 81 PageID #:  570\nhave met their public housing equalization obligations under the Final Judgment. \n10.  The parties agree that HUD shall continue to monitor the following housing \nauthorities for compliance with public housing program requirements, Section 8 housing \nvoucher choice requirements, and desegregation plan requirements: \nBeaumont \nPort Arthur \nOrange County (pending disposition of its housing projects) \nParis \nHenderson \nCleveland \nTexarkana \nHUD's obligation to monitor the above-listed housing authorities under the terms of this \nAgreement shall terminate when the DHO requirement specified in ~ 1, above, has been \nsatisfied.  The parties agree that the only additional requirement for all other housing \nauthorities in the class action area (including the Nacogdoches Housing Authority) is to \ncooperate with HUD's DHOP in order to create the 1500 desegregated housing \nopportunities required by this Order. HUD's obligation to monitor these housing \nauthorities under the terms of this Order shall terminate when the DHO requirement \nspecified in ~ 1 above has been satisfied. \n11.  HUD shall prepare a written report, on a monthly basis, indicating the total \nnumber ofDHOs created by the East Texas Fair Housing Services Center and the \n5 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 6 of 81 PageID #:  571\nDHOPHAs during the preceding month. \nHUD shall also prepare a written report, on a quarterly basis, describing for the quarter in \nquestion the monitoring activities undertaken pursuant to ~ 10, above, and indicating the \nstatus of the remaining neighborhood equalization projects being undertaken pursuant to \nthe Settlement Agreement and Release which was previously entered into by the \nPlaintiffs, HUD and the State of Texas, and which was filed with this Court action on \nMarch 20,2003. \nThe above-described reports shall be submitted by HUD to Plaintiffs' counsel until such \ntime as HUD fully provides the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, and 10 of \nthis Stipulation and Order. \n12.  If the DHO placement process is completed prior to the end of the two-year \nextension of the FHSC contract, the parties agree that the FHSC will continue to perform \npost-placement counseling and other activities within the scope of the grant agreement.  If \nthe DHO placement process is not completed prior to the end of the two-year extension of \nthe FHSC contract, the parties agree that the DHOPHAs will continue operating, and the \nlitigation will continue until the 1,500 DHOs described in ~ 1, above, have been achieved. \nIn the event that such an extension ofDHOPHA activities occurs, there will be no further \nextension of the FHSC grant. \n13.  This Stipulation and Order modifies the Final Judgment and Decree  by \neliminating therefrom the following requirements: \n1)  Waiting list initiatives (Final Decree, Section III) \n2)  Computerized tracking system, reporting and monitoring (Final Decree, Section \n6 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 7 of 81 PageID #:  572\nVIT) \n3)  Racially hostile site (Final Decree, Section V).  The parties agree that the \ndevelopments in Vidor and Bridge City will be sold. \n4)  Area Wide Housing Opportunity Program (AHOP)(required by the Golden \nTriangle Desegregation Plans) \n5)  Order of Offers (Final Decree, Paragraph IT. 1)  \n6)  DHO Placement numbers per community (Final Decree, Paragraphs IT.2, IT.3, & \nIT.4) \n7)  Project-Based Section 8 (Final Decree, Paragraph 1I.5) \nThe parties further agree that this Stipulation and Order modifies the Final Judgment and \nDecree as specifically provided herein and supercedes all other remedial orders entered in \nthis Action. \nPart II:  Conditions and Release and Termination of the Litigation \n14.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to require HUD to provide additional \nfunding, other than that which is expressly agreed to herein. HUD's duty to discharge the \nobligations imposed upon it by the express terms of this Order is subject to: (a) the \navailability of funding from Congress for any purpose for which funding is required;  and \n(b) the existence of statutory authority for the acts necessary for HUD's performance of its \nobligations under this Order.  HUD shall not be found to be in violation of this Order on \naccount of any failure to perform any obligation imposed upon HUD by the terms of this \nOrder that results: (i) from the unavailability of funding from Congress necessary for \nperformance, or (ii) from the modification or revocation of statutory authority that is \n7 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 8 of 81 PageID #:  573\nnecessary for such performance by HUD.  IfHUD does not provide the specific relief to \nthe class set out in ~~ 1,3,4, & 10 of this Stipulation and Order, then HUD's obligations \nunder this Stipulation and Order shall not be deemed complete and plaintiffs shall be \nentitled to seek a court order requiring additional relief from HUD but which shall be \nlimited to such relief as the Court shall determine to be necessary and appropriate to \nprovide the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3,4, & 10 of this Stipulation and \nOrder.  HUD shall be entitled to oppose any such motion for additional relief. \n15.  Upon provision of the specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3, 4, & 10 ofthis \nStipulation and Order, the plaintiffs and all of the class members, and each of them, and \ntheir heirs, administrators, successors, or assigns (together, the \"Plaintiffs\"), shall be \ndeemed to have released and forever discharged HUD and any component, division, \nagency, or establishment ofHUD, and all current and former HUD officials \nadministrators, employees, agents, attorneys, or successors thereof (together the \n\"Defendants\"), from any and all claims and causes of action, known or unknown, which \nplaintiffs have, or could have asserted, by reason of, with respect to, in connection with, \nor which arise out of, any of the matters alleged at any time in this Action, including, \nwithout limitation, any claim of race-based discrimination in housing programs funded by \nHUD, and any of the matters alleged in the Complaint, the Amended Complaint, or in any \nother pleading, motion, or other paper served or filed by plaintiffs, which the plaintiffs or \nany ofthem have against the Defendants or any of them. \n16.  Upon provision ofthe specific relief to the class set out in ~~ 1, 3,4, & 10 of this \nStipulation and Order, the plaintiffs and all of the class members and each of them, shall \n8 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 9 of 81 PageID #:  574\nbe forever barred and enjoined from prosecuting any claims or causes of action that are \ndescribed in ~ 15, above. \n17.  Nothing contained in this Order shall: \nA.  Impose on HUD any duty, obligation, or requirement to produce any particular \nresult other than to perform the specific obligations that are imposed on HUD by the \nexplicit terms of this Order; \nB.  Impose on HUD any duty, obligation, or requirement the performance of which \nwould be inconsistent with any law, rule, or regulation in effect at the time of such \nperformance; \nC.  Impose on HUD any duty, obligation, or requirement to award, grant, or otherwise \nmake available to the plaintiffs or any other party any benefits under any program \nadministered by HUD, except as specifically and explicitly set forth herein; \n18.  Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, the parties shall file a joint motion \nfor the approval and entry of this Order pursuant to Rule 23( e) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \n19.  This Order, the entry of which is a condition precedent to any obligation of any \nparty hereunder, shall be effective upon the approval, execution, and entry hereof by the \nCourt pursuant to Rule 23(e ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The date of such \nentry shall be the \"effective date\" of this Order.  If this Order is finally disapproved by \nany court, or fails to become effective, or is approved by the Court with any modification \nto which HUD has not consented during the Rule 23(e) process, or is finally reversed or \nmodified on appeal, this Order shall be null and void, shall have no further force and \n9 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 10 of 81 PageID #:  575\neffect, and shall not be used in this Action or in any other action or proceeding; and, this \nOrder, all court proceedings pursuant to Rule 23(e), Fed.

P., and all negotiations, \nfilings, and statements made in connection herewith, shall be without prejudice to any \nperson or party, shall not be deemed or construed to be an admission by any party of any \nfact, matter, or proposition, and shall not be used in any manner, or for any purpose, in \nsubsequent proceedings in this Action, or in any other action, whether judicial or \nadministrative. \n20.

ETFHSC  will  continue  to  efficiently  calculate  highly  complicated \ndemographic data within a specific geographic range and determine all but \nthe objective elements of a property's DHO status. \n3.  If a DHO unit  is  located in  an unmapped census  block,  i.e.,  the  unit \nappears to be in a census block outside the court-approved mapped areas \nof East Texas cities, and the class member believes the unit is appropriate \nfor his or her family needs, the class member will be required to sign off \non the Unit Fact Sheet (UFS) for the unit to be counted as a DHO. \n4.  ETFHSC will continue to work with HUD as requested to demonstrate the \nuse ofthe program for use by DHOPHA's. \n1 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 27 of 81 PageID #:  592\nc. \nLandlord Outreach Activities \n1.  ETFHSC  will  continue to  identify potential  landlords  through existing \ndatabases, such as HUD's CISN29 database of all owners and managers \ncurrently participating in the various Section 8 programs in the class area; \n2.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  contacting \ncommunity housing boards, trade organizations, apartment associations, \nfair housing groups and other housing related organizations for assistance \nin identifying owners and managers of rental units in the class area; \n3.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  contacting \nJustices of the Peace in the class area for assistance in identifying owners \nand managers of rental units in the class area; \n4.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  contacting \nCounty  Commissioners  in  the  class  area  for  assistance  in  identifying \nowners and managers of rental units in the class area; \n5.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  contacting \nBoards of Realtors  in the class area for  assistance in identifying those \nRealtors that (a) own rental units, (b) act as agents for owners of rental \nunits, and (c) can identify owners or managers of rental units in the class \narea; \n6.  ETFHSC will continue to identify potential landlords by contacting the \nChambers  of Commerce in  the  class  area for  assistance  in  identifying \nowners and managers of rental units in the class area; \n7.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  obtaining \npublications of available rental units in the class area, such as apartment \nlocators and housing guides; \n8.  ETFHSC will continue to identify potential landlords by obtaining yellow \npage listings of rental units in the class area; \n9.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  identify  potential  landlords  by  reviewing \nproperty ownership rolls for multiple property owners in Tax Assessors \nOffices in the class area; \n10. ETFHSC will continue to implement its marketing plan that targets both \nmulti-unit owners and managers and also owners and managers of units \nwith three and more bedrooms, placing emphasis on in-person recruitment \nof the targeted categories of owners and managers, and utilizing telephone \nand written recruitment for non-targeted owners and managers.  The plan \n2 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 28 of 81 PageID #:  593\naddresses  landlord development through contacts with individuals with \nreputations for community involvement, such as persons on the boards of \ncivil  rights,  fair  housing,  and  community  economic  development \norganizations.  Also included in the marketing plan is the development of \npresentations to groups and meetings where the opportunities of program \nparticipation can be explained to property owners and managers; \n11. ETFHSC  will  continue  to  utilize  previously  developed  landlord \nrecruitment materials; \n12. ETFHSC will continue to utilize previously developed landlord outreach \nand information packets, information flyers and direct mailers utilizing the \nmaterials referenced in subtask C.II to market the benefits of program \nparticipation and recruit potential landlords.  ETFHSC will continue to \ndistribute  these packets  to  the potential landlords identified in  subtask \nC.IO; \n13. Real Estate Specialists will execute the marketing plan and enter results \ninto the Desegregative Housing Database; and \n14. Potential landlords exhibiting an interest in program participation will be \nencouraged to  do  so by Real  Estate  Specialists,  who  will  continue  to \nsupply  information  as  needed  on  landlord/tenant  rights  and \nresponsibilities,  leases,  termination  of  tenancies,  evictions,  deposits, \nhousing quality standards, utilities,  rights  of entry,  assistance programs \nand other resources for problem solving. \nD.  Desegregative Housing Database \n1.  ETFHSC will maintain its computerized database that holds information \non housing in desegregative areas and potential landlords; \n2.  All ETFHSC staff will continue to be trained in the efficient use of the \ndesegregative housing database.  This will include training in entering data \ndirectly  into  the  database,  generating  reports  based  on  the  database, \nfinding specific records, and the significance of each part of the database; \n3.  ETFHSC will continue to periodically inspect the desegregative housing \ndatabase  for  errors.  This  will  involve  such  tasks  as  querying  the \ninformation for obviously incorrect data, looking for rarely updated entries \nand looking for entries with a very little data; \n4.  As ETFHSC identifies new desegregative housing, ETFHSC will continue \nto  add  the  information  regarding  the  identified  housing  to  the \ndesegregative housing database, on a continuing basis; \n3 \n\n:  Case 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 29 of 81 PageID #:  594\n5.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  periodically  update  the  information  in  the \ndesegregative housing database.  This will include such things as updating \nthe  availability  of  vacancies,  the  current  rental  rates,  and  other \nmiscellaneous information.; \nE.  Assistance with Rent Exceptions \n1.  ETFHSC will continue to enter rental market data from Unit Fact Sheets \nas a means of rent monitoring activities in DHO areas; \n2.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  conduct  rent  monitoring  activities  in  DHO \nareas, as needed; \n3.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  conduct  rent  monitoring  activities  in  DHO \nareas,  as  needed,  to  include  random  sampling  and  review  of local \nnewspapers,  telephone  calls  to  local  landlords,  and  requests  for  rent \ninformation from knowledgeable associations and organizations; and \n4.  ETFHSC  will  continue  to  determine  whether  rents  in  DHO  areas  are \nadversely affecting the creation of DHOs for class members.  Where the \nfair market rent established by HUD for a given area is at or below the \naverage rental rate determined by ETFHSC or the PHA, the rates shall be \npresumed  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  creation  of DHOs,  and \nETFHSC  will  consider  requesting  that  HUD  grant  exceptions  to  the \npayment standards  for  vouchers in  a sufficient amount to increase the \navailability of DHOs for class members. \nF.  Eligibility Review Services \n1.  ETFHSC shall review all clients of the FHSC for Class Member status via \nutilization of HUD' s CISN29 system. \n2.  ETFHSC will screen all clients who contact ETFHSC.  This screening will \nconsist  of  obtaining  relevant  financial  information  and  ascertaining \nwhether  the  client  is  otherwise  in  compliance  with  HUD  regulations \nrelating  to  income,  family  composition,  citizenship  and  eligible \nimmigration status.  The client will then receive information regarding \nHUD's regulations for the Section 8 program and assurance of the clients \nwillingness to comply with these regulations will be sought.  All assertions \nby the client during this pre-screening will be taken  at face  value.  If \nduring the course of the pre-screening the client is  found  to not be in \ncompliance with HUD regulations, ETFHSC will inform the client of their \nnon-compliance and of their present ineligibility for housing through the \nSection 8 program.  Possible remedies for the client's non-compliance will \nbe sought.  If, however, it appears that the client is in full compliance with \nHUD regulations, they will be referred to the receiving DHOPHA for a \n4 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 30 of 81 PageID #:  595\nfinal determination of eligibility.  A statement of the financial information \ngiven by the client and a statement of willingness to comply with HUD \nregulations will be signed by the client and kept on file by ETFHSC in a \nmanner consistent with the client's right to privacy. \nG.  Initial Stage of Counseling \n1.  ETFHSC will continue to provide initial counseling sessions to groups of \nclass members who are residents of public housing authorities as identified \nin HUD'S CISN29. \n2.  The staff of ETFHSC will continue to receive training on the requirements \nof, and any relevant changes to, the Section 8 program. \n3.  Meetings will be primarily arranged with ten to twenty class members. \nETFHSC Housing Specialists will direct each of these meetings.  The goal \nof these meetings will be to provide each of the elements of initial stage \ncounseling.  These meetings will be designed to encourage class members \nto  seek second stage counseling and  eventually de segregative housing. \nThus, the presentation will be general in nature and accompanied by a \nvariety of handouts designed to provide more detailed explanations.  The \nmeetings will be organized in a coherent and accessible manner and will at \nleast  cover  the  topics  of  Section  8  program  terminology,  program \nrequirements pertinent to Section 8 rental vouchers, counseling services \nthat will be available to ETFHSC clients, general information on solving \ncredit problems, housekeeping, searching for housing,  and dealing with \npotential landlords.  Some of these topics are obviously more appropriate \nfor second stage and post placement counseling, where more detailed and \nindividualized information can be provided.  Therefore,  topics  such as \ncredit  and  housekeeping  will  only  be  dealt  with  generally  during  this \nseSSIOn. \n4.  ETFHSC will continue to hand out an information packet at initial stage \ncounseling sessions.  These materials will expand on each of the topics \ndiscussed during the initial stage counseling meeting.  The goal of this \npacket is to encourage as many class members to apply for second stage \ncounseling as possible.  Therefore this information will be designed not to \noverwhelm the potential client with either technical terminology or too \nmuch information. \nH.  Fair Housing Counseling \n1.  ETFHSC will train all staff on fair housing laws and issues so that fair \nhousing violations can be identified, factually developed, and forwarded to \nHUD'sFHEO; \n5 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 31 of 81 PageID #:  596\n2.  ETFHSC will compile fair housing publications for use in all stages of \ncounseling; \n3.  ETFHSC  will  actively  encourage  clients,  class  members  and  other \nresidents of federally assisted and subsidized housing to notify ETFHSC \nstaff of perceived violations of fair housing laws.  ETFHSC will forward \nreported fair housing law violations to HUD's FHEO office; \n4.  The Housing Specialists will provide fair housing counseling at all stages \nof client counseling,  as  needed.  Specifically,  Housing Specialists  will \npresent an overview of fair housing laws at initial stage counseling, with \nemphasis on relating the information through real life factual scenarios. \n5.  During initial  stage,  second  stage,  and post placement  counseling,  the \nHousing Specialists will discuss the illegality of housing practices that are \nbased on race, skin color or national origin, inclusive of familial status and \nhandicapped  accessibility.  Because  clients  will  be  actively  seeking \nhousing during the second stage of counseling, relevant topics that will be \ncovered  include  housing  opportunities  offered  only  in  select \nneighborhoods,  site-specific  placement,  \"no  children\"  policies,  and \nselective placement based on prohibited actions/activities.  Additionally, \nlease  requirements  under  HUD  rules  and  regulations  and  landlord \nobligations, tenant rights, duties and responsibilities under State law will \nbe discussed.  Finally, information on how and where to file a fair housing \ncomplaint will be provided, along with a complaint form.  Clients will be \nassisted in completing complaints, as necessary; \n6.  ETFHSC  will  compile  reported  violations  to  document  pattern  and \npractice fair housing law violations by landlords, owners, and managers; \nand \nI.  Second Stage Counseling (Motivational Support) \n1.  From the first contact with the family, the FHSC will need to help families \nmaintain a consistent and high level of enthusiasm and commitment to the \nprogram.  For  many  families,  the  possibility  of  living  in  a  new \nenvironment will be sufficient to energize their activities and strengthen \ntheir resolve.  However, other families may be more timid about learning \nnew  skills  (like  finding  available  units  and  dealing  with  prospective \nlandlords)  or  looking  for  units  in  unfamiliar  locations.  Keys  to \nmaintaining a family's motivation to succeed include: \na.  Provide detailed information to individual families about housing \nopportunities in desegregative areas; \n6 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 32 of 81 PageID #:  597\nb.

Refer each family to at least three vacancies in desegregative areas \nin neighborhoods selected by the family; \nd.  Assist  families  in  their  housing  search,  as  needed,  including \nproviding escorts and transportation to unfamiliar neighborhoods; \ne.  Assist in lease negotiation; \nf.  Provide assistance in passing landlord screening requirements; \ng.  Address fears directly and discuss them thoroughly; and \nh.  Assure the family that it has the continuing and active support not \nonly  of the  FHSC,  but  also  of an  array  of service  providers \navailable to solve particular problems; \n2.  ETFHSC will assist the client in determining which desegregative areas \nare of interest to the client and will provide detailed information about \nhousing options for the areas designated by the client.  Where DHOs exist \nin  areas  of interest  to  the  client,  ETFHSC  will  provide  information \nincluding the address of the DHO, the prospective landlord's name, and \nthe appropriate contact telephone number.  ETFHSC will use the housing \ndatabase discussed in subtask 0.1 for this purpose, and will also provide \ninformation on the number of available units, number of bedrooms per \nunit, and other assorted information that will be of interest to ETFHSC \nclients. \n3.  ETFHSC shall provide class members with standardized instruction and \nhandouts  relating  to  house  cleaning.  House  cleaning  counseling  will \ninclude: \na.  Appropriate handouts relating to the task of house cleaning; \nb.  Instruction  on  why  house  cleaning  should  be  important  to  the \nclient; \nc.  Assistance to the client in developing charts on cleaning tasks; and \nd.  Assistance  to  the  client  in  developing  an  individualized  house \ncleaning plan. \n4.  ETFHSC shall provide class members with standardized instruction and \nhandouts  to  assist  the  client  in  developing  economic  self-sufficiency. \nSelf-sufficiency counseling will include: \na.  Instruction on the importance of economic self-sufficiently to the \nclient; \nb.  Instruction on budgeting for fixed and variable expenditures; \nc.  Assistance in developing a budget suited to the individual client \nneeds; \n7 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 33 of 81 PageID #:  598\nd.  Instructions  on  maintaining  a  checkbook  and  avoiding \noverdrafts; and \ne.  Screening client for eligibility for social programs that may result \nin an increase in family income or resources.  Referrals to social \nand advocacy agencies will be made, where applicable. \n5.  ETFHSC shall provide class members with standardized instruction and \nhandouts relating to employment.  Employment counseling will include: \na.  Helping the client develop a work history; \nb.  Suggesting methods for searching for jobs; \nc.  Developing an individualized employment search plan; and \nd.  Providing  a  list  of  resources/agencies  for  supplemental \nemployment counseling. \n6.  ETFHSC shall provide class members with standardized instruction and \nhandouts  regarding  continuing  education.  Continuing  education \ncounseling will include: \na.  Assessment of client's educational background; \nb.  Discussion of the benefits of continuing education for the client \nand their dependents; \nc.  Development  of  an  individualized  education  advancement \nplan; and \nd.  Referral to social or civic organizations. \n7.  ETFHSC shall provide class members with standardized instruction and \nhandouts on dealing with potential landlords.  Instruction on this topic \nwill include: \na.  Instruction on duties and obligations of tenants; \nb.  Enhancing personal presentation; \nc.  Developing checklist for landlord interview; \nd.  Assisting the client in addressing potential landlord concerns; \nand \ne.  Stressing the importance of post landlord interview follow up. \n8.

Case 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 34 of 81 PageID #:  599\n9.  ETFHSC  shall  provide  class  members  with  information  on  the \navailability of day care, the availability of indigent health care, and the \nlocation of various federal, state, local and private agencies that may be \nof assistance to the family. \nJ.  Post-Placement Services. \n1.

HUD  will  continue  the  DHO  Program  to \nprovide higher exception pt.!Yment standards,  landlord incentives, \nand class member assistance pt.!Yments in order to provide DHOs \nfor class members in the East Texas Ltigation area. This program \nis onlY available to Young v.

A DHO \nprogram to be continued in the 35-county litigation area will direcdy address \nthe impediments associated with DHO creation. The DHO program will \nemploy  three  initiatives  to  achieve  the  goal  of increasing  desegregated  housing \nopportunities.  HUD, the 25 Housing Authorities administering the Housing Choice \nVoucher program in the East Texas litigation area, and the East Texas Fair Housing \nService Center (ETFHSC) will implement the initiatives.  First, HUD will extend the \nwaiver approving increased exception payment standards in 26 East Texas counties for \nYoung class members (as defined in Chapter 9) who move into DHOs with Housing \nChoice Vouchers.  Second, HUD will provide moving expense allocations to class \nmembers who move into a DHO.  Third, HUD will provide landlord incentives to \nlandlords who offer new and/or additional non-impacted units for rental by Young \nclass members.  The DHO program began March 14, 2002, and will continue until \nsuch time as the required total number ofDHOs is achieved \n1 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 43 of 81 PageID #:  608\nTEXAS  STATE  OFFICE  OF  PUBLIC  HOUSING \nDesegregated Housing \nOpportunity Program \nPublic Housing Authorities \n(DHOPHA) \nThe 25 Houing~ in the East T~ l.iiigdimt area that administer \nthe Housing Oxite VlJIIthr Prrgwn will implement the DHO prrgwn \ninitiatiws. \nT\nhe 25 DHOPHAs that administer the Housing Choice Voucher Program in \nthe East Texas litigation area and the counties included in each jurisdiction are: \nHardin,  Jasper, \nSabine,  San  Augustine, \nCherokee,  Henderson, \n2 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 44 of 81 PageID #:  609\nTEXAS  STATE  OFFICE  OF  PUBLIC  He.  ;lNG \n10.

There are \nR\na variety  of techniques PHAs have successfully used to reach and retain \nowners with units located in racially non-impacted census blocks. Some of \nthese techniques  are listed below. While each DHOPHA must select the \napproaches it believes will be effective in its area and then test their effectiveness, \nHUD, the DHOPHA, and the ETFHSC will meet to develop a marketing strategy \nfor that area. \nFrequendy,  the  enthusiasm  of property  owners  for  the  housing  choice  voucher \nprogram fluctuates with the strength of the rental market. Owners who advertise their \ninterest in families  with housing assistance when the market is  soft may become \nreluctant when there are plenty of renters looking for vacancies at any price. \nThe PHA that expects to maintain strong utilization rates through periods of economic \ngrowth will need to treat landlords as important partners in the program. Probably the \nmost important effort in maintaining the interest of landlords is the PHA's success in \nserving landlords with efficient, market-oriented business practices. The cardinal rule \nto successful PHA-landlord relationships is timely HAP payments. Like all rent, \nthe HAP payment is due and payable on the first of each month. Property owners \nneed rental income to cover mortgage payments and the costs of maintaining the \nproperty. One late payment will catch the attention and remain in the memory of even \nthe largest landlord. Consider encouraging landlords to have HAP payments deposited \ndirecdy into their accounts. Consistent timeliness from one year to the next will form \nthe basis of the landlord's willingness to work with the PHA to find resolutions when \ndifferences arise. \n33 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 75 of 81 PageID #:  640\nTEX'~- STATE  OFFICE  OF  PUBLIC  H  --'SING \nThe second most important area of PHA perfonnance and perhaps the area where \nPHAs have the most difficulty succeeding is inspections. In a tight housing market, \nhigh performing owners are able to tum an apartment over in 24 hours when an HQS \ninspection is not required. When PHA staff fail to acknowledge the unassisted renter as \nits competition and respond appropriately, owners may not find patience for the PHA \ninspection process.  HUD rules  require  PHAs with  programs  smaller  than  1,250 \nvouchers to complete an initial inspection within 15 days of receiving the request for \ntenancy approval and encourage larger agencies  to strive  for  similar perfonnance. \nWhile PHA staff may find the 15 day standard a challenging one, owners with the \nchoice of another tenant ready to move in immediately will see this as 15 days of lost \nrental income. In addition to speed, consistency is also important. Nothing can be \nmore frustrating to an owner than finding that inspectors from the same office make \ndifferent calls on identical conditions. Beyond that, consistency in standards may result \nin educating the owner and helping him or her know what items must be repaired \nbefore the next initial or annual inspection. The owner's ability, with an understanding \nof HQS standards, to prepare a unit to pass the HQS inspection at the inspector's first \nvisit will serve the needs of both the owner and the PHA. \nA landlord's experience with annual inspections will also contribute to his interest or \ndisinterest in subsequent voucher program leases. Consistency and responsiveness are \nessential. Any additional effort to serve the needs of the landlord is worth considering. \nSpecial efforts to decrease the amount of the landlord's time invested in voucher \nprogram procedures  may make  the  program more  appealing  to landlords.  Some \nhousing agencies arrange for the owner and tenant to sign the lease and the HAP \ncontract in the unit at the time of the initial inspection if the unit passes the initial \ninspection. Some schedule all of the annual inspections in a building at one time. A \nstrongly recommended practice is to eliminate local requirements for owner signatures \nat the time of the annual inspection or the annual reexamination. There are no HUD \nrules requiring landlord signatures in the annual renewal cycle. \nLandlords also appreciate PHA assistance in dealing with problem tenants. Without \never appearing to \"take sides\", the PHA can often help by meeting with the landlord \nand  tenant  together  and  impartially  reviewing  the  obligations  of each  and  the \nconsequences of violating those obligations. \nImproving the landlord's ability to contact an inspector or get the answer to a \nquestion can have a significant impact on the landlord's enthusiasm for the \nprogram. In a busy voucher program, an inspector's telephone answering machine \nmay fill up with messages in the time it takes to retrieve the accumulated messages. In \nmany situations, better landlord service can be provided by either an ombudsperson or \nsupervisor responding to landlord calls if that person has the knowledge and the \nauthority to solve the landlord's problem. In the absence of an ombudsperson, a clerk \nwho can make changes to an inspector's schedule, find the answer to a technical \nquestion or take a detailed message may be more helpful than a machine. In every case, \nhowever, making staff accountable for responsiveness to landlords is essential. \nGeneral, on-going communication with landlords is also helpful to maintaining their \nenthusiasm for the program and can be accomplished with a newsletter or flyer stuffed \n34 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 76 of 81 PageID #:  641\nTEX\"  STATE  OFFICE  OF  PUBLIC  H  'SING \nin the envelope with the HAP check The newsletter can educate landlords about \nprogram requirements, inform landlords about changes in the program and provide \nhelpful hints including property maintenance information not specifically related to the \nprogram. The PHA option to screen housing choice voucher program applicants may \nbe used to better serve landlords. There are, however, potential pitfalls in this practice; \nand, the PHA must be cautious in implementing screening procedures.  The PHA \nmust be particularly careful not to promise more service than it can truly deliver. A \nPHA that decides to conduct screening beyond drugs and violent criminal activity will \nbe wisest to specify  the screening activities  the PHA will  perform and those  the \nlandlord will be expected to perform. The PHA should provide only information on \nthe sources contacted and the specific information received, not the PHA's judgment \nas to the meaning or value of responses received. \nOne PHA has established an advisory board of landlords who have experience with \nthe  PHA's  housing  choice  voucher  program.  Landlords  on  the  advisory  board \nparticipate  in  briefings  for  potential landlords,  assist  the  PHA in  recruiting new \nlandlords and may assist in resolving program or processing issues with other program \nlandlords. \nWhen the PHA does a good job of keeping current landlords happy, it will have greater \nsuccess at recruiting additional landlords. \nVarious techniques that a PHA may use to recruit landlords are as follows: \n./  Landlord briefings (information meetings about the housing choice voucher \nprogram) are a tried and true approach to getting the attention of potential \nlandlords; \n./  Participation by PHA representatives as speakers at meetings of real estate \ngroups is another beneficial activity; \n./  Many PHAs have become members oflocal property owners organizations; \n./  Landlord advisory group; \n./  Newsletters; \n./  Meetings with real estate groups; \n./  Use of PHA web site to provide explanations of program information; \n./  A  number of PHAs  have  developed  special incentives  to  encourage  the \nparticipation of new landlords; \n35 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 772    Filed 10/23/03   Page 77 of 81 PageID #:  642\nT EX'  5 TAT E  0  F Fie E  0 F  PUB Lie  H  -, 5 I N G \no  Some have used either administrative fee reserves or grant money to \ncover \"holding fees\" offered to landlords in place of rent until an initial \ninspection and lease up activities can be completed. \no  PHAs have also used gift certificates to local restaurants as an \nincentive  for  new  landlord  participation  and  for  current \nlandlords who bring a new landlord to the program. Staff at one \nPHA was surprised that this approach worked so well and was \nrelatively inexpensive. Staff reported,  \"If you feed them,  they \nwill come.\" \n./  Tenancy education program; \n./  Credit counseling and repair program; and \n./  One message, delivered at briefings and in newsletters that has been \nsuccessful  in  attracting  landlords'  attention  is  a  suggestion  that  the \nlandlord can eliminate the cost of advertising vacant units. For good \nunits in a strong market, if the landlord informs the PHA of a vacancy, \nthe PHA can assure the landlord of its ability to refer tenants . \n./  Landlord list from CISN29 may be used as an inventory of current or \npast participants  of the  Housing  Choice  Voucher Program.  For this \nreason the  Housing  Authority must make every effort to  update the \nlandlord contract information. \nThe best way to recruit new owners is to operate the housing choice voucher program \neffectively and treat owners professionally. Treat landlords as the important business \npartner that they are, and make additional efforts to serve the landlord's needs. This \nincludes minimizing the time required to inspect units and to start HAP payments, \napplying  program rules  consistendy,  being  timely  and  predictable  in all  program \nprocessing, maintaining effective and prompt communications with owners  (e.  g., \nreturning calls quickly, identifying a single point of contact), and making payments \naccurately and on time. \nThe landlord contact information must be recorded in CISN29 at the time the \nvoucher holder submits the Request for Tenancy Approval (RFfA) form. If the \nlandlord previously participated in the voucher program, the landlord's name and \ncontact information will appear on the screen. The user should review the \ninformation displayed and determine if all contact information (contact name, \naddress, and phone number) matches the data on the RFfA. If the contact data \nmatches, the user should select the landlord name and the new unit information \nwill be added to the landlord inventory. If the landlord data does not match, the \nuser should update the landlord contact information.

Some PHAs have \nhad success in using such programs, including certificates that families have \ncompleted training, as a marketing tool in attracting new owners; \n./  Help in negotiating the rent and conducting a housing choice voucher holder \nowner meeting to be sure that both parties have a common set of expectations \nabout the relationship; and \n./  Quick follow-up (some PHAs offer 24 hour access) if there are issues between \nthe owner and tenant that cannot be easily resolved. This promise of fast \nintervention is a major attraction to many owners.

No party, or party representative, heir or agent, will take any action of any \nkind whatsoever, whether in conjunction with this litigation or not, to make \nthe State a party of this Action or seek any subsequent court-ordered \nenforcement action against the State to require it to provide financial \nassistance contemplated by the Final Judgment in this Action.  The plaintiffs, . \ntheir representatives, heirs or agents, will not take any legal action against \nHUD, either in this litigation or in separate litigation to compel HUD to \ninstitute any administrative or judicial proceedings against the State to \nprovide additional financial assistance for neighborhood equalization \n2 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 760    Filed 03/20/03   Page 3 of 12 PageID #:  493\nactivities contemplated by the Final Judgment in this case for any non-CDBG \nentitlement City in the class action counties. \n2.  The $13,126,339 million committed by the State to funding the neighborhood \nequalization activities fulfills HUD's obligation to provide financial \nassistance for neighborhood equalization activities for any community that is \nnot designated as a CDBG Entitlement City.  The $13,126,339 million \ncommitted by the State to funding the neighborhood equalization activities \nfully satisfies any obligation the State may have under any federal statute or \nregulation, or any provision of the East Texas Comprehensive Desegregation \nPlan, to provide neighborhood equalization funding for the implementation of \nthe Final Judgment and Decree entered in this action.  The Plaintiffs will not \ntake any legal action against HUD, either in this litigation or by separate \nlawsuit, to compel HUD to institute any administrative or judicial proceedings \nagainst the State to enforce any statutory or regulatory provision, or any \nprovision of the East Texas Comprehensive Desegregation Plan, involving \nany duty the State may have to provide neighborhood equalization funding for \nthe implementation of the Final Judgment and Decree entered in this action. \n3.  The neighborhood equalization activities that remained to be funded as of \nAugust 2001, shall be categorized in the two attached lists, entitled Priority 1 \nand Priority 2.  The Priority 1 list is the list of communities and activities that \nshould be given first priority, based upon the number of class members \naffected.  Priorities range from highest (most class members affected) to \nlowest (least number of class members affected).  The Priority 2 list identified \n3 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 760    Filed 03/20/03   Page 4 of 12 PageID #:  494\ncommunities that would be funded only upon availability of funds after all \nPriority 1 activities have been funded. \n4.  Subsequent to August 2001, the State proceeded to fund as many of the \nPriority 1 activities that could be addressed from the $2.3 million provided \nfrom its 2001 CDBG allocation.  It is agreed that Priority 1 activities will be \nfunded by the State first and that if funds remain from the total of \n$13,126,339, including the additional $4,429,557, then Priority 2 projects will \nbe funded in the order in which they appear on the list. \n5.  Upon completion of the activities funded by the $13,126,339, HUD will be \ndeemed to have complied with the neighborhood equalizations requirements \nof~ 1.1. Physical Improvements To Projects and Neighborhoods of the Final \nJudgment and Decree as it applies to non-entitlement cities. \n6.  This agreement is contingent upon the State actually providing the additional \n$4,429,557 for the Priority 1 and Priority 2 activities by September 30, 2003; \nthe State's awarding grants for Priority 1 and 2 in the total amount of \n$4,429,557 will satisfy this obligation.  If the State does not actually provide \nthe additional $4,429,557 funding, then the agreement is void and the parties \nagree that this agreement will not bar any subsequent judicial or \nadministrative proceedings against either the State or HUD. \n7.  By this agreement and subject to the contingency in paragraph 6., the State is \nhereby RELEASED from any and all causes of action, claims, rights, or \nremedies that Plaintiffs or any Defendant, including HUD, could have brought \narising out of, related to or indicated by, the claims, transactions and \nallegations made the subject matter of the Action.  It is the intent of all parties \n4 \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 760    Filed 03/20/03   Page 5 of 12 PageID #:  495\nto this Agreement that the Action be fully and finally resolved as to the State \nand any actual or perceived State obligations resulting from the Action.  HUD \nagrees the State will not be required to make any additional reference to any \nissue resulting from the Action in the State's Analysis ofImpediments to Fair \nHousing, dated January 2003, and submitted on January 15,2003. \nOF COUNSEL:  ROBERT D.

This  Notice \nprovides  information  on  the  terms  of  a  proposed  final  settlement  of  all \nclaims  against  HUD  in  this  case  and  the  rights  of  Class  Members.  As \nexplained below,  a  public  hearing  will  held  in U  ited States  District \nCourt  in  Tyler,  TX  (\"the  CourtH on  •  A~the hearing  will \n) \ndetermine  whether  the  proposed  settlemen  is  fair,  reasonable,  and \nadequate.

If you  wish  to  object  or  otherwise  comment  on \nthis proposed  settlement,  you  must  follow  the  instructions  contained  in \nPart  II  of  this  Notice. \nThis  case  was  originally filed  in  1980.  The  complaint  alleged  that  HUD  had \nknowingly  maintained  and  continued  to  maintain  a  system  of  racially \nsegregated  housing  in  70  public  housing  authorities  (PHAs)  located  in 36 \ncounties  in East  Texas.  Specifically,  plaintiffs  asserted  that  HUD \nknowingly  acquiesced  in  the  racially discriminatory  housing  practices  those \n70  housing  authorities  in East  Texas  by  continuing  to  fund  and  oversee  this \nhousing.  Judgment  was  entered  against  HUD  on  July  31,  1985  and  an  interim \ninjunction was  entered  in  1988.  A  Final  Judgment  and  Decree  (Final \nJudgment)  was  entered  against  HUD  on  March  31,  1995.  Numerous  disputes \nhave  arisen  between  the  parties  concerning  HUD's  level  of  compliance  with \nthe  terms  9f  the  Final  Judgment  as  well  as  the  appropriateness  of  various \nterms  of  the  Final  Judgment.  The  parties  have  since  entered  into \nnegotiations  for  a  final  settlement  that  will  resolve  these  disputes  and \nmodify  the  Final  Judgment  that  currently applies  to  HUD.  YOU  ARE  HEREBY \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 775    Filed 10/29/03   Page 5 of 8 PageID #:  662\nNOTIFIED,  pursuant  to  the  Court's  order  to  provide  this  notice,  that  the \nparties  have  reached  a  settlement  of  all  of  the  allegations  against  HUD. \nThe  settlement  is  subject  to  the  Court's  approval,  and  it will  affect  your \nrights  as  member  of  the  Plaintiffs'  Class. \nTHIS  NOTICE  DOES  NOT  INCLUDE  THE  WHOLE  SETTLEMENT  AMONG  THE  PARTIES  OR  THE \nTEXT  OF  ANY  OF  THE  RELEVANT  DOCUMENTS.  THIS  NOTICE  IS  DESIGNED  ONLY  TO \nPROVIDE  A  BASIC  OUTLINE  OF  THE  LITIGATION  AND  THE  SETTLEMENT  AND  TO  PROVIDE \nINSTRUCTIONS  ON  HOW  TO  OBTAIN  FURTHER  INFORMATION  REGARDING  HOW  TO  OBJECT \nOR  OTHERWISE  COMMENT  ON  THE  SETTLEMENT.  This  Notice  is  not  an  expression \nby  the  Court  or  any  of  the  parties  on  the  fairness  of  the  settlement. \nI.  The  Litigation \nFinal  Judgment  can  be  characterized as  containing  three  major \n~he \nelements:  a)  physical  improvements  to  low-rent  public  housing  sites  and  the \nneighborhoods  in which  they  are  located,  b)  elimination or  reduction  in  the \nnumber  of  one-race  low-rent  public  housing  projects;  and,  c)  the  creation \nof  5,134  housing  opportunities  (\"DHOsY)  for  class  members. \n~esegregated \nPhysical  Improvements:  To  date,  at  a  cost  of  approximately  $59  million,  HUD \nhas  essentially satisfied the  physical  improvement  requirements  of  the \nFinal  Judgment.  The  State  of  Texas  provided  $8.6  million  in  CDBG  funds  for \nthe  neighborhood  improvements  and  has  agreed  to  provide  an  additional  $4.4 \nmillion  in  CDBG  funds,  which  will  be  sufficient  to  complete  all  the \nremaining  neighborhood  improvement  projects \nOne-Race  Housing  Projects:  At  the  time  of  the  entry of  the  Final  Judgment \nsome  93%  of  the  public  housing  sites  in East  Texas  were  predominantly  one \nrace  sites.  Since  the  entry of  the  Final  Judgment,  the  number  of \npredominantly one-race  sites  has  been  substantially reduced.  However, \napproximately  half  of  the  public  housing  sites  in  East  Texas  can  still be \ncharacterized  as  predominantly one-race.  According  to  data  available  to \nthe  parties,  it appears  that  a  number  of  those  sites  in all  likelihood will \nremain  predominantly  one-race  sites  due  to  demographic  and  other  factors \nbeyond  the  control  of  HUD  or  the  Court. \nDHO  Creation:  The  Final  Judgment  required HUD  to  create  5,134  DHOs  within \nseven  years  of  the  date  of  the  Final  Judgment.  The  Final  Judgment  also \nrequired  that  DHOs  be  provided  in  accordance  with  the  number  and  type  of \nDHO,  which  HUD  had  determined  to  be  needed  within  each particular  PHA \njurisdiction.  The  Final  Judgment  mandated  the  creation of  the  East  Texas \nFair Housing  Services  Center  (ETFHSC)  to  provide  mobility  counseling  to \nclass  members,  to  recruit  landlords  with  housing  units  in non-minority \ncensus  blocks  to  participate  in  the  Section  8  program,  and  to  refer class \nmembers  to  landlords  when  qualified housing  units  became  available.  HUD \nwas  required  to  fund  the  ETFHSC  at  a  funding  level  of  no  less  than  $500,000 \nper  year  for  a  period of  five  years.  The  five-year  funding  period ends  on \nDecember  3,  2003.  Between \nDecember  1998  and  June  2001,  the  ETFHSC  had  created approximately  222  DHOs. \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 775    Filed 10/29/03   Page 6 of 8 PageID #:  663\nIn  response  to  an  enforcement  motion  filed  by  plaintiffs  in  February  2001, \nHUD  voluntarily undertook  a  Demonstration  Project  in  5  of  the  36  East  Texas \ncounties.  The  purpose  of  the  Demonstration  Project  was  to  determine \nwhether  the  rate  of  DHO  production  could  be  increased  through  a  program \nthat  significantly  increased  Section  8  payment  standards,  provided  cash \ngrants  to  class  members  of  up  to  $1500.00  for  moving  expenses,  rent  and \nutility deposits,  and  paid  cash  bonuses  of  up  to  $1000  to  participating \nlandlords.  The  Demonstration  Project  proved  to  be  successful.  The  ETFHSC \ncreated more  DHOs  during  the  first  seven  months  of  the  experiment  than  it \nhad  created during  its  entire preceding  three-year  history of  operation. \nHowever,  the  seven-year  deadline  for  creation of  5,134  DHOs  expired  on \n,March  30,  2002  and  the  parties  disagree  as  to  the  precise  number  of  DHOs \n·that  have  been  created  thus  far  and  whether  it is  possible  to  create  the \nrequired  number  of  DHOs  in a  reasonable  period  of  time \nrn  addition  to  the  February  2001  enforcement  motion,  Plaintiffs  have \nfiled  a  May  2002  motion  to  enforce  in part  and  modify  in part,  the  Final \nJudgment  and  a  July  2002  motion  to  hold  HUD  in contempt  for  failing  to \nreach  the  5,134  DHO  goal  within  the  original  March  30,  2002  deadline  and \nfor  failing  to  employ  project-based Section  8  assistance  in  certain \nspecified  localities where  there  are  insufficient  existing  rental  units  to \nsatisfy the  specific  numerical  DHO  requirement  for  those  localities.  In \naddition,  HUD  filed  a  motion  to  modify  the  Final  Judgment  to  eliminate  the \nseven-year  deadline  for  creating  the  5,134  DHOs  and  announces,  at  that \ntime,  that,  in March  2002,  it had  adopted  a  new  Desegregated  Housing \nOpportunities  Plan  (DHOP)  which  would  extend  the  enhancements  to  the \nSection  8  program made  under  the  Demonstration  Project  to  all  36  East  Texas \ncounties.  None  of  these  above-described  motions  have  been  heard  or decided \nby  the  Court.  The  parties  have  since  entered  into  negotiations  for  a  new \nsettlement  that  will  resolve  these  disputes  and  simultaneously modify  the \nFinal  Judgment. \nThe  proposed  settlement  agreement  eliminates  the  numerical  goal  of  5,134 \nDHOs  and  substitutes  a  new  performance  standard.  HUD  will  be  deemed  to  be \nin  full  compliance  with  its DHO  production  obligations  if,  from  and  after \nMarch  28,  2003,  HUD  creates  an  additional  1500  DHOs.  The  settlement \nagreement  also  reduces  the  burden  of  DHO  creation by  eliminating  the \njurisdiction-specific DHO  targets.  HUD  will  continue  to  operate  its DHOP, \nincluding  the  increased  Section  8  exception  standards,  cash grants  to  class \nmembers,  and  landlord  incentives,  until  the  additional  1500  DHOs  are \ncreated.  Funding  for  the  ETFHSC  will  be  continued  at  the  rate  of  $900,000 \nper year  for  an  additional  two  years  beyond  the  December  3,  2003 \ntermination  date  for  the  existing  FHSC  contract.  In  addition,  HUD  will \nprovide  an  additional  $40,000  per month  to  the  FHSC  for  the  balance  of  the \nexisting  contract. \nHUD's  obligation  to  monitor  PHA  compliance  will  be  reduced  to \nmonitoring  seven  specified  PHAs  that  have  had  past  programmatic  compliance \nproblems  for  compliance  with  public  housing  program  requirements,  section  8 \nhousing  voucher  choice  requirements  and  desegregation  plan  requirements. \n\nCase 3:80-cv-00008-LED   Document 775    Filed 10/29/03   Page 7 of 8 PageID #:  664\nMonitoring  of  the  remainder  of  the  70  PHAs  will  be  limited  to  ensuring \ntheir  cooperation  in  the  DHO  creation effort.  All  monitoring  requirements \nwill  terminate  when  the  new  1500  DHO  goal  is  reached.  In  addition,  under \nthe  settlement  agreement,  several  other provisions  of  the  Final  Decree  will \nbe  entirely eliminated. \nWhen  the  new  1500  DHO  goal  is  reached,  the  parties  will  submit  a  joint \nmotion  to  dismiss  the  case,  with prejudice,  and  the  plaintiffs will  be \ndeemed  to  have  granted  to  HUD  the  customary  full  release. \nYOU  AND  THE  CLASS  would  give  up  your  right  to  challenge  any  role  played  by \n,HUD  in any  alleged  segregation or  other  civil  rights  violation  that  has \noccurred  in  the  public  housing  programs  in  the  70  PHAs  located  in  36 \ncounties  in  East  Texas,  as  well  as  any  actions  taken  by  HUD  described  in \nthe  settlement  and  in  full  satisfaction of  the  claims  made  by  the  plaintiff \nclass  HUD.  There  will  be  no  payment  of  damages  of  any  kind  to \n~gainst \nclass  members. \nII.  Rights  of  Class  Members \nIf you  are  a  member  of  the  class  identified on  the  first  page  of  this \nNotice,  you  will  be  eligible  to  receive  the  benefits  of  this  settlement  and \nwill  be  bound  by  its  results.
