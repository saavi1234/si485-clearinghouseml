    "summary": "<p>On July 27, 1992, fourteen minority families and the NAACP filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, and the city of Minneapolis.</p><p>The plaintiffs, represented by the Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis, sought injunctive relief, claiming that the defendants' administration of Minneapolis public housing programs created and perpetuated racial segregation. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that public housing in Minneapolis was located, built, and operated under a longstanding policy of de jure racial segregation dating back to the 1930s, and that the defendants failed to remedy this segregation. For a detailed account of the origins of this suit and the history of Minneapolis public housing policy, see: Timothy L. Thompson, <i>Promoting Mobility and Equal Opportunity:  Hollman v. Cisneros</i>, 5-SPG J. Affordable Housing & Community Dev. L. 237 (1996).</p><p>On July 5, 1994, the District Court (Judge James M. Rosenbaum) certified a class of all minority households participating in or on the wait list for public housing and section 8 voucher programs.</p><p>Three years into this case, and after two years of negotiations and extensive public hearings, the parties settled the lawsuit by signing a consent decree. The decree's terms are encompassed in an order, entered by the District Court (Judge Rosenbaum) on April 20, 1995. The agreement's stated purpose was:<blockquote>[T]o set out a series of actions to be taken by Defendants which will promote equal housing opportunity, expand and maximize geographic choice in assisted housing, and encourage racial integration, by (1) deconcentrating racially concentrated public housing projects, (2) improving living conditions in remaining family public housing units, (3) relocating public housing units to areas outside of minority concentrations, (4) improving administration of the Section 8 Existing Housing program so as to remove barriers to effective choice, (5) expanding access to application opportunities for assisted housing, (6) developing means to encourage expansion of low-income housing opportunities in suburban cities in the metropolitan area, and (7) ensuring Defendants remain committed to preserving and expanding location choice and the goals of fair housing.</blockquote>The consent decree contemplated a term of seven years to accomplish these goals, during which the District Court retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes between the parties. For a discussion of the implementation of the consent decree and the resultant social and political tensions, see: Ciara Carolyn Torres, <i>Housing in the Heartland: An Examination of the Hollman v. Cisneros Consent Decree, the Politics of Racial Concentration and the Possibilities Offered by Democratic Experimentalism</i>, 17 Nat'l Black L.J. 98 (2003).  </p><p>For several years, the parties operated under the terms of the decree with little involvement by the court.  During this time, the defendants began to demolish the 770 public housing units and relocate the 770 families at the center of the lawsuit. They also provided class members with an additional 900 section 8 vouchers, and began construction of the replacement housing.    </p><p>In the late 1990s, there was a rental housing shortage in Minneapolis. This unforeseen occurrence prompted the NAACP, in its capacity as individual plaintiff, to move for a preliminary injunction and a modification of the consent decree. Specifically, the NAACP asked the District Court (Judge Rosenbaum) to enjoin the defendants from continuing demolition of the remaining public housing units, and to order the defendants instead to rehabilitate the old units, thereby better serving the immediate housing needs of the class members. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that such an injunction and modification was beyond the scope of its dispute resolution power contemplated by the parties when signing the consent decree.  Shortly thereafter, the defendants demolished the remaining units.  </p><p>As work under the consent decree continued, it became apparent that the defendants would need more than seven years to fulfill their obligations. Accordingly, in July 2002, the parties extended the term of the decree and the jurisdiction of the District Court until November 1, 2004. In March 2004, the parties reaffirmed this extension, and the court ordered the case to be closed on November 1, 2004, allowing petitions to reopen the case until October 1, 2006.  </p><p></p>",

ORDER \nMartinez  et  al. \nPlaintiffs  seek  an  order  extending  the  Court's  jurisdiction \nover  the  parties  to  effectuate  a  consent  decree  entered  on  J~ril \n21,  1995. \nThe  parties  have  extensively  briefed  this  issue,  and  all \nparties  -- save  one  -- have  mutually  reached  accord.  Excepting \nonly  the  lone  dissenting  party,  all  have  agreed  upon  both  this \nmatter  and  have  agreed  which  partiE:s  may  be  presently  dismis:sed. \nThe  Court  heard  oral  argument  on  June  13,  2002. \nThe  lone  dissenting party is the United States of America,  by \nits  agency,  the  United  States  Department  of  Housing  and  l rban \nDevelopment  ( \"HUD\") .  HUD  opposes  any  temporal  extension  of  this \nCourt's  jurisdiction.  Because  the  objector  is  the  sovereign,  the \nCourt  affords  its  interests  the  special  respect  and  consideration \nto  which  it is  entitled. \nThis  case  involves  the  parties'  effort  to  root  out  and \nameliorate  a  more  than  75-year-long  pattern  of  racial \ndiscrimination  in  the  siting  and  construction  of  housinsf \nincluding  public  housing  -- in  Minneapolis,  Minnesota,  and  its \nenvirons.  To date,  the consent decree has necessitated the rerroval \nFILED \nRICHARD D.

The  relocated families and residents have \nused a  number of state and  federal  programs  to fund  their moveB  and \nthe  services  those  moves  require.  Hundreds  of  new  housing  tmits \nare  under  construction,  with  hundreds  more  to  follow. \nWhen  the  consent  decree  was  entered,  the  parties  ambitiously \nagreed  upon  a  seven-year  program  within  which  to  complete  the \nproject.  In  a  thousand  different  ways,  however,  the  realities of \nlife,  humanity,  and  the  workings  of  multiple  governmental  units, \nboth  elected  and  appointed,  have  worked  to  slow  the  project's \ncompletion from the seven-year timeline.  Some  of those events have \nnecessitated  this  Court's  intervention.  See.  e.g ..  Am.  Consent \nDecree,  March  23,  2000  [Docket  No.  187]. \nMeetings,  almost  literally countless,  have been held to review \nthe  changes  and  steps  required for  this ambitious  enterprise.  The \nCourt  is  aware  of  City  council  meetings  in  many  local  suburban \ncommunities,  as  well  as  hundreds  of  meetings  with  dispJaced \nindividuals and  interested groups.  Documents  have  been transJ.ated \n2 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 222   Filed 07/12/02   Page 3 of 6\ninto five or more  lanquaqes,  and individuals have been counseled in \ntheir  own  tongues,  all  in  an  effort  to  smoothe  areas  of  friction \nand  make  this  undertaking possible. \nSeven  years  has  simply  not  been  enough  time.  This  would \nlikely be  so,  even  in the  best  of  all possible worlds.  It  is even \nmore  true  in  this  world  -- the  one  of  reality  in  which  all \npeople,  even  those  of  goodwill,  do  not  always  act  in  perfect \naccord. \nWith  these  facts  in  mind,  the  Court  turns  to  HUD's  request \nthat  the  Court  dismiss  it  from  the  case  and  decline  to  extend \njurisdiction over  it.  HUD  argues  it is before  the  Court  pur:::uant \nonly  to  the  consent  decree  it  signed  seven  years  ago.  AllE'•3ing \nthat  it  has  fulfilled  all  of  its  commitments,  and  claiming  the \nconsent  decree  requires  no  further  action on  its part,  HUD  states \nthere  is  no  reason  for  the  Court  to  extend  its  jurisdiction, \nparticularly given  the  sovereign's  lack  of  assent  -- which  it  is \nunwilling  to  provide. \nThe  parties  seeking  the  Court' .s  extended  jurisdiction rE,ply, \nciting  a  number  of  duties  which  may  require  HUD' s  assistance  or \nassent.  These  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  EUD's \nresponsibilities  to  cooperate  in  and  co-sponsor  the  formaticn  of \nstrategies and  implementation of policies,  as  required by  ~  6(1;  to \nmonitor and insure compliance review of the Minneapolis defenda.nts, \nas  required  by  ~  98;  to  conduct  the  fair  housing  certifications \n3 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 222   Filed 07/12/02   Page 4 of 6\nrequired  in  ~  86;  to write  the  annual  update  letter required  in  ~ \n92;  to  fund  and  supervise  future  Section  8  resources,  as  required \nin~ 66;  to  regulate  new  private  owners,  as  required  by~ 6E;  to \napprove  mobility  counseling  and  other elements  of  the  progran1,  as \nrequired by~ 71;  to provide enforcement  and review,  as required in \n~~ 89  and  90;  and to maintain the discretionary exception rent!>  for \nSection 8,  and to maintain statistical and census data,  as required \nby  ~  104;  all  of  which  are  delineated  in  the  original  consent \ndecree. \nThe moving parties agree HUD  has complied with its obligations \nenumerated  in  the  consent  decree,  they  claim  HUD's  assistance  is \nboth  necessary  and  to  be  expected  as  the  parties  continue  their \nefforts to  fully comply with the  consent  decree.  But  while HUD  is \nnot  required  to  perform  any  specific  acts  immediately,  the  Court \nconsiders  that  those  who  seek  to  keep  HUD  in  the  case  have  the \nbetter part  of  the  argument. \nPlaintiff's  arguments  prevail  for  a  simple  reason:  the \nparties  chose  to  resolve  this  case  by  agreement  and  elected  to \nspare  the  Court  the  onerous  and  probably unhelpful  duty  of  either \nsubmitting this matter  to a  jury or of making  Findings  of  Fact  and \nConclusions  of  Law  at  trial.  Suffice  it  to  say  that  the \nregrettable and extreme concentration of racial minorities intc> one \nsmall  geographic  area  of  this  community  is  the  offspring  of  many \nparents.  At  one  time  or  another,  each  party  to  this  suit  had  a \n4 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 222   Filed 07/12/02   Page 5 of 6\ndime  in the game.  The  Court  casts no  aspersions  toward  any ps.rty, \nbecause  all  are  participating  in  resolving  the  situation with  an \nopen  hand  and  with  good  intent.  But  this  long  history  strongly \ncounsels  the  Court  against  allowing  any  party to  be  released  from \nthis action,  and from this Court's  jurisdiction,  until the goa:.s of \nthe  decree  are  very  substantially effectuated. \nIt  is  absolutely  possible  -- indeed  the  Court  considers  it \nlikely  -- that  as  this  case,  with  all  of  its  urban  planning, \nfunding,  permitting,  and land transfers,  moves  to conclusion,  HUD's \ninvolvement  will  be  required.  The  Court  knows  that  if  HUD  is \ndismissed  from  this  case,  it can  certainly be  located.  The  Court \nalso knows  HUD  is susceptible to process.  On  the other hand,  t.here \nis the distinct possibility that if HUD  were  later sought  (for this \nsuit  or  settlement,  or  one  reasonably  related  to  it),  there  c:ould \nwell  be  a  protracted  search  for  a  jurisdictional  basis  and \nappropriate  avenue  of  relief.  These  bases  are  unquestionably \npresent  at  this  time,  as  the  parties  attempt  to  expeditiously \nconclude  the  extended  and  complex  resolution  to  which  they  all \nagreed  a  short  seven years  ago. \nTherefore,  after considering each parties' position,  the Court \nfinds  it  proper  to  extend  its  jurisdiction  over  this  matter  and \nthese  parties  -- including HUD  -- to  and  until  November  1,  2C04. \nThe  Court  specifically cautions  and  advises  the  parties  that \nit is not  offering a  blank check or a  permanent  right of accesE;  for \n5 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 222   Filed 07/12/02   Page 6 of 6\nthis  case.  But,  to  the  contrary,  no  party  should  be  lulled  into \nconcluding  it  might  \"outlast\"  the  Court,  and  thereby  evade  its \nresponsibilities  under  the  settlement  agreement.  This  remains  a \nlawsuit;  it has  a  beginning,  and  it will  have  an  end.  The  Court \nwill  be  pleased  to  uphold  its  responsibilities  as  the  parties \nendeavor  to  comply  with  theirs. \nTherefore,  based  on  the  filE~S,  records,  and  proceedings \nherein,  IT  IS  ORDERED  that: \n1.  By  agreement  of  the  parties,  the  consent  decree  and \njurisdiction  of  the  Court  over  defendant  Metropolitan  Council \n[Docket  No.  218]  is  terminated. \n2.  Jurisdiction  over  defendants  Mondale  and  Ryan  is \nterminated. \n3.  The  Court's  jurisdiction  over  this  matter  and  the \nremaining  defendants  [Docket  Nos.  202  &  205]  is  extended  Lntil \nNovember  1,  2004. \nJ \nDated:  July/~ ,  2002 \nDistrict  Jt:.dge \n6 ",

That the Consent Decree approved by the Court on April20, 1995 be fmiher mn:::nded \nby making the changes to Paragraphs 11 and 16 set out below: \n11.  Minority Concentrated Area means: any census tract in the Metropolita:1 Area \ntr \nwith a minority population which is twenty percentage points greater  an the \npercentage of minority population in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan \nStatistical Area (MSA).  To qualify as a Minority Concentrated Area in \nMinneapolis, the census tract must also have a poverty population greater \nthan the city-wide average.  As of the date of this Amendment and based \nupon year 2000 census data, any census tract with a minority popdation \ngreater than 35.3% is a minority concentrated area:, except in the case of \nMinneapolis where a census tract must also have a poverty population greater \nthan 16.9%. \n16.  Poverty Concentrated Area means: (1) in Minneapolis or St. Paul, a census \ntract with a population at or below poverty which is fifteen percentage points \ngreater than the percentage of population below poverty in the City. As of the \ndate of this Amendment and based upon year 2000 census data, Minneapolis \ncensus tracts with a population at or below poverty of at least 31.9% of the \ncensus tract population and St. Paul tracts with a poverty population of at \nleast 30.6% ofthe tract population are poverty-concentrated areas. (2) Ln the \nsuburbs, a census tract with a poverty population which is one and a half \ntimes  greater  than  the  percentage  of population below  poverty 1 n  the \nMetropolitan Area as a whole are poverty concentrated areas.

Moving to Work Agreement.  HUD stipulates and agrees that as of \nDecember 9, 2003, $12,840,871 was available in the MPHA's Section 8 program reserve \nto provide capital funding for replacement housing under Amendment No. 1, dated \nDecember 14, 2000, to the Moving to Work (MTW) Agreement between HUD and \nMPHA.  Except as provided below, this $12,840,871, as well as the additional $525,000 \nreferred to in paragraph 6(a) of this Stipulation and Order, will remain available for \ncapital funding until spent by the MPHA for Hollman replacement housing purposes.  No \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 2 of 13\nnon-capital section 8 expenditures by the MPHA, prior to the date of execution of this \nstipulation, will reduce this amount available for capital expenditures.  No non-capital \nsection 8 expenditures by the MPHA, subsequent to the date of this stipulation will \nreduce this amount available for capital expenditures unless:  a) no Section 8 funds \nremain in the MPHA' s Section 8 reserve other than those deemed available for capital \nexpenditures herein;  b) HUD is not in default of any duty to replenish such reserves or to \nprovide additional Section 8 funding; and c) there are capital funds in the reserve account \nwhich are not obligated by contract to be spent to fund public housing development \nrequired by the decree.  In that case, the MPHA shall expend such unobligated funds as \nare necessary to meet Section 8 program financial obligations and to discharge other \nSection 8 Program responsibilities.  In consideration for the foregoing HUD \nacknowledgments and commitments, (a) the MPHA forever waives and releases any and \nall rights to the accrual or expenditure of any additional Section 8 funds - other than the \n$12,840,871 and $525,000 referred to above-pursuant to Provision II of Appendix A to \nthe MTW agreement, and (b) Provision II of Appendix A to the MTW agreement is \nhereby acknowledged as null and void except as it applies to the  $12,840,871 and \n$525,000 referred to above. \n2.  RHF Funding for FYs 2001-2003.  HUD will allow the MPHA to retain \n$1,103,259 of Replacement Housing Factor (RHF) funds that HUD had indicated its \nintent to recapture by letter dated April 1, 2003 from Deputy Secretary Liu to the \nMPHA's Executive Director.  These represent RHF funds for fiscal years (FYs) 2001-\n2003 that HUD hereby agrees, for purposes of this Stipulation and Order, were \nappropriately awarded to the MPHA, given that (a) 143 public housing units were \n2 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 3 of 13\nawarded under the decree as \"incentive\" units awarded to other housing authorities rather \nthan \"replacement\" units for purposes of the statutory \"one for one\" replacement \nrequirement, (b) as a consequence, under the terms of the decree, 143 Section 8 vouchers \nprovided by HUD under the decree were deemed to be replacement units for purposes of \nthe statutory \"one for one\" replacement requirement, and (c) for purposes ofHUD's RHF \nregulations,  replacement funding provided in the form of Section 8 assistance does not \nnegate a housing authority's entitlement to RHF funding for units removed from the \nhousing authority's public housing inventory. \n3.  RHF Funding for FYs 2004-2005.  Consistent with the foregoing provision \nand the five-year duration ofRHF funding under HUD regulations, HUD will, subject to \nCongressional appropriations, award the MPHA approximately $350,000 ofRHF funding \nfor the aforementioned 143 demolished Hollman units in each of fiscal years 2004 and \n2005. \n4.  RHF Funding for FYs 2006-2010.  The MPHA intends to timely apply for a \nsecond five years ofRHF funding, beginning in fiscal year 2006, for the aforementioned \n143 Hollman units.  HUD agrees to consider such timely application for funding under \nthe eligibility criteria that are applicable to all housing authorities at that time and \nacknowledges that, assuming adequate appropriations and the continued applicability of \nthe eligibility criteria that were in effect at the time of the execution of this Stipulation \nand Order, the MPHA would be eligible to receive approximately $350,000 per year \nbetween fiscal years 2006 and 2010. \n5.  Repayment of RHF Funds.  In the near future, HUD will recapture from the \nMPHA $3,537,782 in RHF funds, consistent with the aforementioned April!, 2003letter \n3 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 4 of 13\nfrom Assistant Secretary Liu.  The remaining $1,877,000 due to HUD pursuant to that \nletter will be repaid by MPHA in installments as provided herein.  The MPHA intends to \nrepay the amount due with all RHF funds received in Fiscal Years 2004 and subsequent \nyears with respect to the 143 Hollman units referred to in Paragraphs 2-4 above.  HUD \nacknowledges that repayment of the amount due is an eligible use of these funds. \nAssuming that the aforementioned RHF funds are provided by HUD in the approximate \namounts indicated above, the MPHA will repay the $1,877.000 according to the \nfollowing schedule: \nBefore 9/30/04  $350,000 \nBefore 9/30/05  $350,000 \nBefore 9/30/06  $350,000 \nBefore 9/30/07  $350,000 \nBefore 9/30/08  $350,000 \nBefore 9/30/09  $127,000 \nIf the aforementioned funds are not provided in these amounts, the MPHA will repay the \ndebt to the maximum extent possible by the end of fiscal year 2009 and in full by the end \nof fiscal year 2010, after which time HUD may offset any amount owing against HUD \ngrants for capital purposes that would otherwise be payable to the MPHA or take any \nother legally available collection action.  HUD will not take any punitive action against \nthe MPHA for its $1,877,000 expenditure ofRHF funds that is the origin of the debt \ndiscussed herein. \n6.  MPHA Section 8 Program \n(a)  \"One Month Reserve\".  Based on the MPHA's representation that it does \nnot seek to operate its Section 8 program with a full one-month's reserve to cover higher-\nthan-anticipated program costs, HUD hereby agrees to allow the MPHA to use for \nHollman capital purposes, under the MTW Agreement, an additional $525,000 of its \n4 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 5 of 13\ncertain increased HAP obligations beyond those reflected in the PHA's initial annual \ncontributions contract for the year only if the PHA's reserve balance is less than an \namount equal to 50% of the average monthly cost of the PHA's voucher program for \nHAPs, based on the most recent six months of HAP data submitted by the PHA (i.e., half \nof the PHA's one-month reserve amount, as defined in paragraph 6(a) herein).  The \nPHA's balance is determined by adding to the balance approved by HUDon the most \nrecently closed year-end statement the budget authority applicable to each month since \nthat date and subtracting therefrom disbursements for Section 8 HAP contracts since that \ndate.  Unless and until applicable law changes or HUD procedure is changed for all \nPHAs, HUD will consider the foregoing precondition to have been met with respect to \nthe MPHA, if the MPHA's reserve balance calculated in this manner, but excluding the \nportion of the MPHA's Section 8 reserves that are eligible for capital expenditure, is less \nthan an amount equal to 50% of the MPHA's one month reserve amount, as defined in \nparagraph 6(a) herein. \n7.  Production of remaining public housing units.  At the time of the execution \nof this stipulation, fifty of the 770 public housing units which the Decree requires are not \nyet under contract.  These will be produced on the following schedule: \na.  Thirty eight (38) units in the third rental phase of the Heritage Park \ndevelopment.  Local defendants will take all reasonable measures to make \nthese units ready for occupancy as early in 2005 as possible, but in any event, \nthese units will be ready for occupancy by December 31, 2005, unless local \ndefendants apply to the Court to reopen the Decree for an extension of time. \n6 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 6 of 13\nb.  Seven (7) units will be developed by the MPHA on scattered sites.  Four (4 ) of \nthese will be ready for occupancy by December 31, 2004 and the other three \n(3) by December 31, 2005. \nc.  The MPHA has applied for $1 million from the City and MCDA's (hereinafter \nreferred to collectively as \"the City\") Affordable Housing Trust Fund for the \ndevelopment of the final five (5) units on a site at 3824 West 44th Street in \nMinneapolis. These units will be ready for occupancy by January 30, 2006. \nIf the MPHA anticipates that the funding for these units will not be available \nso as to permit timely completion, it is the MPHA's intent to temporarily \ndesignate 5 units in the elderly project to be developed by the MPHA with \nHOPE VI funds within the Heritage Park as Hollman replacement units, \ncarrying the Hollman occupancy priorities.  The MPHA will in that case \ndesignate the next five family public housing units it develops in non \nconcentrated areas as Hollman replacement units and will assign these units \nHollman occupancy priorities.  In that case, the MPHA may remove the \nHollman priorities from the HOPE VI units.  Plaintiffs reserve their right to \napply to the Court for a determination that MPHA and/or the City are legally \nobligated under the Decree to fund, and the MPHA to develop, the remaining \nfive units within a designated time period, and that the designation of HOPE \nVI units must be temporary, and MPHA and the City reserve their right to \nargue to the Court that they are not so obligated. \n8. Production of the homeownership units.  The City has entered a development \nagreement for the construction of 167 units ofhomeownership housing on property north \n7 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 7 of 13\nof Olson Memorial Highway.  The development agreement calls for more than 100 of \nthese units to be completed and ready for occupancy by December 2005, and all167 units \nto be ready for occupancy by December 2006.  The remaining 193 of the total 360 \nhomeownership units called for in the Master Plan are to be constructed in the \nredevelopment project area described in the Master Plan, or on sites near the \nredevelopment project area.  Construction of the remaining 193 units will be completed \nby December 31, 2009.  This Stipulation does not relieve the City of its obligations under \nthe Consent Decree for implementation ofthe homeownership component of the \nredevelopment project, as called for in the Action Plan and Master Plan. \n9.  Construction oflnfrastructure and Parks.  The City plans to construct the \nNorth-South Boulevard (Van White Memorial Boulevard) between Plymouth Avenue \nNorth and Glenwood Avenue North by the end of2004.  The extension ofthe Boulevard \nbetween Glenwood Avenue North and Dunwoody Boulevard will be constructed by the \nend of 2008.  Sumner Park north of Olson Highway will be completed by the summer of \n2004.  Construction of the new park south of Olson Highway has begun and the City \nplans for it to be completed by the fall of2006. \nI 0.  Nothing in this stipulation relieves MPHA or the City of any other remaining \nobligations they may have under the Decree. The fact that the Court's jurisdiction will \nterminate in 2004 and that the period in which to reopen the decree will terminate in 2006 \n(as set out below) does not affect the plaintiffs' rights to assert any breach of contract \nclaims to enforce the decree against local defendants subsequent to those time periods. \nII.  Release of Claims Against HUD.  In consideration for the foregoing HUD \n8 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 8 of 13\nacknowledgments and commitments, and except as set out in the next sentence, all parties \nto the Hollman decree other than the HUD defendants hereby permanently release the \nHUD defendants from any financial responsibility for matters arising under, or relating to \nany party's performance under, the Hollman decree and hereby permanently release and \nwaive all claims for money or money's worth, including attorneys' fees or costs, that \ncould otherwise have been brought against any of the HUD defendants for any matter \narising under, or relating to any parties' performance under, the Hollman decree. \nNothing in this paragraph, however, shall relieve HUD of the obligations expressly set \nforth in this Stipulation and Order, which will be enforceable by the MPHA, or from \nobligations under provisions oflaw independent from the decree relating to the MPHA's \nexpenditure of funds pursuant to the Annual Contributions Contract in the amount of \n$74,126,542 provided by HUD pursuant to paragraph 32 of the Hollman decree. \n12.  Dismissal of Plaintiffs' motion. In consideration for the foregoing \ncommitments, the Plaintiffs dismiss their motion dated October 3, 2003. \n13.  End of Court Jurisdiction.  The parties hereby stipulate that (a) the Court's \njurisdiction over all parties to the decree shall terminate, and the case shall be closed, on \nNovember I, 2004; and (b) no petitions to reopen the case shall be filed with, or accepted \nfor consideration by the Court, beyond October 1, 2006. \n14.  Dispute Resolution.  The parties hereby stipulate that paragraph 97 \nof the decree (\"Dispute Resolution\") is amended: (a) so that the third sentence reads: \n\"The notice shall specify the facts supporting the allegation, and shall precede the filing \nof any motion to enforce the terms of this Decree or a letter to the Court seeking relief \nin the manner described below.\"; (b) to substitute the words \"seven (7) days\" for the \n9 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 278   Filed 03/30/04   Page 9 of 13\nwords \"thirty (30) days\" in the fourth sentence and to delete the words in the fourth \nsentence that follow that reference; and (c) to add the following sentence to the end of \nthe paragraph: \"The party may initiate the process of seeking relief by delivering a \nletter setting forth all relevant facts to the Court's chambers and providing a copy of the \nletter to counsel of record by the most rapid means available, but in no event less rapid \nthan overnight mail.\" \nSO ORDERED \n\\_.

ORDER \nAndrew  Cuomo  et  al. \nThe  National Association for the Advancement  of Colored People \n(\"NAACP\")  is before the Court,  seeking a  mandatory  injunction which \nwould  restructure  a  class  action  settlement  and  its  resulting \nConsent  Decree.  The  matter  has  been briefed by  the  parties.  The \nCourt  heard  oral  argument  on  September  24,  1999. \nAfter  considering  the  motion,  the  Court  is unable  to  discern \nany  source  of  authority,  either  within  the  terms  of  the  Consent \nDecree  or under  law,  which allows  it to grant  the  relief the moving \nparty  seeks.  Beyond  this,  the  moving  party  is  unable  to \ndemonstrate  that  the  relief  it seeks  will  ameliorate  the  problems \nwith which  it is  concerned.  Accordingly,  the  motion  is denied. \nI.  Background \nThe  NAACP  is  one  of  many  named  plaintiffs  in  a  class  action \nlawsuit  filed  in  1992.  The  class  plaintiffs  sought  relief  from \ndecades-old  Minneapolis  and  metropolitan  housing  policies  which \nthey perceived  to  be  discriminatory.  The  plaintiffs claimed  those \npolicies forced racial minorities into poor-quality public housing,  .. \n. \n'~.  ~  ' \n'. '  '(. \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 2 of 19\nand  resulted  in  thA  RAgregation  of  public  housing  in Minneapolis. \nThe  lawsuit  was  settled  by  virtue  of  an  extraordinarily \ncomplex  agreement  involving multiple  plaintiffs and  no  fewer  than \nsix  governmental  agencies.  Under  its  terms,  housing  and  public \nhousing  policies were  revisited throughout  all  of  Hennepin  County. \nAs  part  of  the  settlement,  a  plan  (\"the  Plan\")  was  prepared  to \nimplement  its goals.  The  proposed  settlement  was  translated  into \nat  least  four  languages.  The  settlement  was  accomplished  only \nafter a  several-month-long period during which  each of  the  parties \npresented  and  debated  its  terms  in  the  most  extensive  community \nwide  comment  and explanation period known  to the Court.  The  matter \nwas  widely  reported  in  the  local  community  and  the  major  news \nmedia. \nThe  public  hearing  and  comment  period,  prior to  securing each \nparties'  assent,  involved  dozens  of  widely-attended  public \nmeetinqs.  These  meetings  explained  and  allowed  extensive  public \ncomment  on  the  settlement  and  the  resulting  Plan.  The  meetings \nrevealed  community-wide  assent  and  broad  public  support  for  the \nresulting Consent  Decree. \nThe  Decree's  terms  are  encompassed  in an  Order,  entered April \n20,  1995.  Under  its terms,  the entire Hennepin County metropolitan \narea  agreed  to  broaden  its  public  housing  base  and  contribute  to \n2 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 3 of 19\nthe  base  of  low  and  moderr::~t.P- income  housing.  Governmentally-\nassisted housing  and  rental  units  are  to be  disbursed,  both within \nand  beyond  Minneapolis's  city borders. \nThe  land on which the original concentrated public housing was \nsited  is  to  be  developed  into  a  mixed  community  of  market-priced \nand  subsidized housing.  Beyond  the  participation of  Minneapolis, \nother communities  in Hennepin County,  and the Metropolitan Council, \nthe program is funded by over $100,000,000  from  the U.S.  Department \nof  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (\"HUD\"). \nA  plan of  this  scope  and  complexity,  obviously,  takes  several \nyears  to  effectuate.  The  Consent  Decree  contemplates  a  term of  at \nleast  seven  years  to  accomplish  this  difficult  and  ambitious \nprogram.  Since  signing  the  Decree,  the  parties  have  labored  to \neffectuate  its  terms,  and  occasionally  have  agreed  to  modify  or \namend  those  terms,  all  with  the  goal  of  effectuating  the  Plan \nencompassed  by  the  Consent  Decree. \nA.  The  Decree \nThe  Consent  Decree,  entered as  an Order  of  the  Court  on April \n20,  1995,  sets  forth  the  parties'  agreement.  Its  stated purpose \nis: \n[T]o  set  out  a  series  of  actions  to  be  taken  by \nDefendants  which  will  promote  equal  housing  opportunity, \nexpand  and  maximize  geographic  choice  in  assisted \n3 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 4 of 19\nhousing,  and  encourage  racial  integration,  by  (1) \ndeconcentrating  racially  concentrated  family  public \nhousing  projects,  (2)  improving  living  conditions  in \nremaining  family  public  housing  units,  (3)  relocating \npublic  housing  units  to  areas  outside  of  minority \nconcentrations,  (4)  improving  administration  of  the \nSection  8  Existing  Housing  program  so  as  to  remove \nbarriers  to  effective  choice,  ( 5)  expanding  access  to \napplication  opportunities  for  assisted  housing,  (6) \ndeveloping  means  to  encourage  expansion  of  low-income \nhousing  opportunities  in  suburban  cities  in  the \nmetropolitan  area,  and  ( 7)  en~nri ng  Defendants  remain \ncommitted  to preserving and  expanding  locational  choices \nand  the  goals  of  fair housing. \n(Consent  Decree,  ~  3.)  The  Decree,  itself,  provides  a  dispute \nresolution procedure  to be  followed  when  disagreements  arise  among \nthe  parties.  (Id.  at  ~  97.)  That  procedure  allows  the  parties  to \nseek  relief  from  the  Court.  (I.Q.. ) \nIn  this  regard,  the  Decree  allows  the  Court  to  \"retain \njurisdiction over this matter for  the purpose of enabling any party \nto this proceeding to apply to the Court  for  such  further orders as \nmay  be  necessary  or  appropriate  for  the  enforcement  of  this \nDecree.\"  (Id.  at  ~  107.)  At  the  same  time,  the  Decree  explicitly \nprovides  that  \"[t]his  Decree  shall  not  be  subject  to  any  change, \nmodification,  amendment,  or  addition  without  the  express  written \nconsent  of  all  parties  to  this  Decree,  except  as  provided  for  in \nparagraph 107.\"  (Id.  at  ~ 117.)  Paragraph  107  provides  that  \"any \nparty may  apply  to  the  Court  for  modification of  this Decree,  but \n4 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 5 of 19\nnot  to  inrn:•afle  ;:my l)?!rty' R  obl igat j ons  under .the. Decree.\"  CI.d.  at \n~  107.)  (emphasis  supplied) \nB.  The  Glenwood/Lyndale  Housing  Projects \nThe  Decree's  express  purpose  is  to  develop  high-quality, \nracially integrated,  decentralized public  housing.  (Id.  at  ~  3.) \nTo  accomplish  this  goal,  the  Decree  requires  the  demolition  and \nreplacement  of  770  public  housing  units.  ( Id.  at  ~  22.)  In \nrecognition of the difficulty of building and disbursing housing on \nthis  scale,  the  Decree  does  not  link  the  demolition  of  existing \nunits  to  the  construction of  replacements.  (Id.  at  ~  28-30.)  The \nDecree  does  require  all  replacement  units  to  be  completed  within \nsix years of HUD's  approval  of  the demolition application.  (Id.  at \n~  44.) \nA  significant  portion  of  the  demolition  has  been  completed. \nTwo  additional  public  housing  projects,  the  Glenwood  and  Lyndale \nprojects,  which  had  previously contained approximately  300  units, \nwere  scheduled  for  demolition  in August,  1999.  In preparation  for \nthis  action,  the  units  were  stripped  of  appliances  and  furnaces. \nThe  units are not  currently habitable.  As  the  scheduled demolition \ndate  approached,  a  number  of  local  citizens,  and  particularly  a \n5 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 6 of 19\ngroup  of  clergy, 1  came  forward  to  oppose  the  demolition.  Tn \nresponse,  the  Mayor  of  Minneapolis  ordered  a  temporary  halt  to  the \ndemolition. \nB.  The  NAACP's  Motion \nShortly  after  these  events,  the  NAACP,  a  signatory  to  the \nDecree,  brought  the present motion.  The  NAACP  claims  its motion  is \ncompelled  by  changes  occurring  in  the  Minneapolis  housing  market \nsince  the  1995  Decree.  Since  the  entry  of  the  Decree, \nMinneapolis's  housing  vacancy  rate has  fallen  to  approximately one \nto  one  and  one-half  percent.  The  NAACP  claims  this  has  created a \nshortage  of  affordable  housing.  It  further  claims  this  has \ncontributed  to  increases  in the  number  of  homele~~ people. \nIn  the  face  of  the  changed vacancy  rate,  the  NAACP  asks  this \nCourt  to  enjoin the  demolition  of  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  units.  It \nalso  seeks  a  Court  Order  modifying  the  Consent  Decree  to  compel \nMinneapolis  to rehabilitate the Glenwood/Lyndale units,  and to open \nthem  for  occupancy  until  the  replacement  housing  is  completed. \nII.  Legal  Analysis \nThe  NAACP's  motion  seeks  two  forms  of  relief:  a  preliminary \n1Several  of  the  interested  clergy,  along  with  a  number  of \nindividuals  and  certain  community  groups,  have  filed  an  amicus \nbrief in support  of  the NAACP's  motion.  ~heir mn~inn to  file their \nbrief  is granted. \n6 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 7 of 19\ninjunction preventing the demolition of the Glenwood/Lyndale units, \nand  an  order modifying  the  Consent  Decree  requiring  the  defendants \nto  rehabilitate,  allow  reoccupation,  and,  necessarily,  fund  the \noperation  of  those  units.  The  Court  considers  the  requests  in \nserial  order. \nA.  Motion  to Modify  the  Consent  Decree \nAs  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  notes  that,  as  of  August, \n1999,  all  parties were  in compliance  with  the  Decree.  When  faced \nwith  community  opposition  to  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  demolition, \nhowever,  the  Mayor  of  Minneapolis  halted  the  demolition,  thereby \nputting  herself  in  defiance  of  the  order  and  frustrating  itf:> \nintent.  But  for this action,  the Glenwood/Lyndale units would have \nbeen  demolished,  and  the  question before  the  Court  would  be  moot. \nOn  the  other  hand,  after  the  Mayor's  action,  the  Court,  the \npublic  media,  and  all parties  know  that  an  agreement  in principle \nto  resolve  these  issues  was  reached  and preliminarily assented  to \nby  all  parties.  Had  this  agreement  been  effectuated,  the  Court's \ndecision  on  this  motion  would  have  been  unnecessary.  This \nagreement  in  principle,  of  course,  could  not  be  put  in  place \nwithout  the  formal  assent  of  all  parties.  (Consent  Decree, \nat  ~  117.)  The  assent  of  all  parties  could  not  be  achieved.  In \nthe  absence  of  the  ~sscnt of  a  cingle  party,  the  agreement  fell \n7 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 8 of 19\nthrough. \nThe  parties'  failure  to  achieve  an  agreement  for  themselves, \nand  on  behalf  of  the  whole  community  -- which  each  deeply  feels  it \nrepresents  compels  the  Court  to  consider  its  own  proper  power \nalong  with  its  consideration  of  the  pending  motion.  The  Court \ncertainly has  the  power,  both  in equity and  under  the  terms  of  the \nDecree,  to review its prior Orders.  But  the  Court  does  not  possess \na  generalized power  to work  its personal  will.  The  Court  cannot  be \na  social  and  community  planner  empowered  to  solve  all  of  the \ncommunity's  ever-changing  problems.  In  a  system  of  separated \npowers,  the Court  must  be vigilant to maintain the  line between  its \nown  judicial  authority  and  the  power  placed  in  the  political \nbranches  -- those  which  have  the  duty  to  define  social  goals,  and \nto  tax and  expend  public  funds  to  accomplish  them. \nThe  NAACP's  motion  asks  the  Court  to  order  changes  in  the \nConsent  Decree  because  of  a  changed  economic  environment.  But  the \nlawsuit  before  the  Court,  and  the  Decree  that  resolves  that \ndispute,  are  not  based  on  questions  of  rental  economics.  The \nparties,  themselves,  defined the  issues in the underlying Complaint \nand  in the  Consent  Decree's  terms. \nThe  NAACP's  brief  is  explicit  when  it  tells  the  Court  that \n\"taxpayers  will  Dt:!  Dt:!LLtn  off having  r.-ehabbed  these  units  and  re-\nB \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 9 of 19\noccupied  them  on  a  temporary basis,\"  and  that  \"[i]t makes  no  sense \nto  demolish  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  units  when  so  many  people  are \nhomeless  and  there are so  few  homes  for  these  families  to live  in.\" \n(Pl.'s  Mem.  Supp.  Prelim.  Inj.  at  8.)  These  statements  may  be \nright  or  they may  be  wrong.  But  they  are  not  questions  the  Court \nis  empowered  to answer. \nThe  job of  the  Court  is  to  enforce  the  law  and  the  agreements \ninto which  the  parties voluntarily entered.  The  Court  cannot  make \nits  own  law  or  rewrite  the  parties'  agreement.  The  NAACP  has \nfailed to offer,  either in its pleadings or in oral argument  before \nthis Court,  any  legal authority which grants  the court the power  to \nprovide  the  relief  it  seeks.  The  NAACP  cannot  point  to  a  source \nfor  such  power,  because  none  exists. \n1.  Authority  to Modify  Under  the  Consent  Decree \nThe  NAACP  contends  the  Consent  Decree,  itself,  grants  the \nCourt  the  authority to order the  rehabilitation and reoccupation of \nthe  Glenwood/Lyndale  units.  The  plain  language  of  the  Decree \nrefutes  this  contention.  Paragraph  117  expressly  prohibits  \"any \nchange,  modification,  amendment,  or  addition  without  the  express \nwritten consent  of  all parties  to  this Decree,  except  as  provided \nfor  in paragraph  107.\"  (Consent  Decree,  at  ~  117.)  Paragraph  107 \nof  the  Decree  reads: \n9 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 10 of 19\nThe  Court  will  retain  jurisdiction over  this matter  for \nthe  purpose  of  enabling  any  party to  this proceeding  to \napply  to  the  Court  for  such  further  orders  as  may  be \nnecessary  or  appropriate  for  the  enforcement  of  this \nDecree.  In the  event  any occurrences  outside  the  control \nof  the  parties  frustrate  the  completion  of  the  actions \nagreed  to  herein.  any  party  may  apply  to  the  Court  for \nmodification  of  this  Decree.  but  not  to  increase  any \nparty's obligations  under  the  Decree. \n(Consent  Decree,  at  ~  107)  (emphasis  supplied). \nThe  Decree  gives  the  Court  authority  to  issue  orders  to \nenforce  its  terms.  The  NAACP  does  not,  however,  seek  to  enforce \nthe  Decree;  it  seeks  to  modify  it  based  on  its  perceptions  of \nchanged  conditions  in the  Minneapolis  housing  market.  The  Decree \nspecifically forbids  any  party to  seek  - and  denies  the  court  the \nability to grant  -- a  modification of  the  Decree  \"to  increase  any \nparty's  obligations.\"  ( Id.) \nThe  NAACP  seeks  to  increase  the  defendants'  obligations  by \nrequiring  them  to  spend  a  sum  its  own  brief  claims  to  be  between \n1. 2  and  3  million  dollars  to  rehabilitate  the  Glenwood/Lyndale \nunits.  (Pl. •s Mem.  Supp.  Prelim.  Inj.  at  7.)  In the absence  of  an \nagreement,  Minneapolis  has  no  obligation to provide  this  sum.  The \ncost  of  maintaining  and  operating  the  units  would,  presumably,  be \nborn by HUD.  But  HUD  clearly advised the Court  at oral  argument  it \nhad  no  obligation  to  provide  those  funds.  Each  step  the  NAACP \nl::H:::!t:!l~.::;  .i::;  d  massive  increase  in  a  party's  obligations,  and  is \n10 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 11 of 19\ndirectly barred by  Paragraph  107  of  the  parties'  agreement. \nThe  Consent  Decree  is  a  contract.  When  parties  enter  into  a \ncontract,  they  define  for  themselves  their  legal  rights  and \nobligations.  Unless  the  contract  is  contrary  to  law,  and  this \nDecree  is  certainly  in  accord  with  the  law,  the  Court  cannot \nrewrite  its terms.  This  is particularly emphasized here,  where  the \nDecree's  terms  explicitly deny  the  power  to  increase  any  party's \nobligations.  The  contract  has  been  entered  as  an  Order,  and  is \nenforceable  with  the  power  of  contempt,  but  it remains  a  contract. \nThe  NAACP  signed  the  contract,  legally  binding  itself  to  its \nprovisions  and  the  terms  of  tl~ Decree. \nThe  NAACP  tries to  find  the  authority  it seeks  in the  Consent \nDecree's  term  allowing  the  parties  to  return  to  Court  if  they \ncannot  resolve  a  dispute  under  its  terms.  The  clause  does  not \nprovide  the  relief  the  NAACP  seeks.2 \n2.  Authority  to  Modify  Under  Rule  60(b) \nThe  NAACP  offers  Rule  60 (b)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \n2The  NAACP  apparently  relies  on  Paragraph  97,  which  outlines \nthe dispute resolution procedure.  That  paragraph merely notes  that \n\"any party may  seek relief  from  the Court.\"  (Decree,  at  ~  97.)  It \ndoes  not  define  the  type  of  relief  available.  It  is  a  cardinal \nprinciple of contract  interpretation that the  specific controls the \ngeneral.  Restatement  (Second)  of  Contracts  §  203(c).  Paragraph \n97's  simple  mention of  court-ordered relief does  not  undermine  the \nspecific  limitatinn  nn  Rttch  relief  set  forth  in Paragraphs  107  and \n117. \n11 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 12 of 19\nProcedure  as  a  grant  of  authority  to  allow  the  Court  to  compel  the \nrelief  it  seeks.  Rule  60(b)  allows  a  court  to  modify  a  consent \ndecree  when  the party seeking  the  modification establishes  \"that  a \nsignificant  change  in  facts  or  law  warrants  a  revision  of  the \ndecree  and  that  the  proposed modification  is  suitably tailored to \nthe changed circumstance.\"  Rufo  v.  Inmates  of Suffolk County Jail, \n502  U.S.  367,  393  (1992).  So,  under  the  rule  in Rufo,  there  must \nbe  both,  1)  a  significant  change  in  facts  warranting  a  revision; \nand  2)  a  showing  that  the  proposed  modification  is  suitably \ntailored to  the  changed  circumstance.  Rule  60(b)  is not  a  general \nlicense  to  the  courts  to  modify  orders  simply  to  achieve  an \notherwise  desirable  goal. \nTo  support  its motion for modification,  the NAACP  offers three \nchanges  in  circumstances  it believes  \"require  that  the  decree  be \namended.\"  (Pl.'s  Mem.  Supp.  Prelim.  Inj.  at  14.)  These  changes \nare  1)  the  lowered  vacancy  rate,  2)  the  large  number  of  homeless \nfamilies  in Minneapolis,  and  3)  the  slow  pace  of  reconstruction. \n( Id.)  None  of  these  circumstances  justify a  modification  of  the \nConsent  Decree. \nThe  Consent  Decree's  express  purpose  is  to  develop  high \nquality,  racially integrated public housing.  (Decree,  ~  3.)  While \naffordable houoing may  be  a  legitimate concern,  it is not  a  concern \n1?. \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 13 of 19\naddressed within the  four corners of  the Complaint  or the  resulting \nConsent  Decree.  As  the  Decree  does  not  address  the  need  for \nincreased  affordable  housing,  a  drop  in  the  vacancy  rate,  and  a \ncorresponding  drop  in the  availability of  affordable  housing,  does \nnot  qualify  as  a  changed  circumstance  justifying  modification  of \nthe  Consent  Decree. \nThe  NAACP  next  expresses  concerns  about  Minneapolis's  homeless \npopulation.  Again,  this  issue  is  not  addressed  in  the  case  before \nthe  Court  or  in the  Consent  Decree.  The  Decree  is  not  focused  on \nhousing  problems  generally;  it is,  instead,  carefully directed  to \nthe  particular problem of  racially-~~gregated,  highly concentrated, \npublic  housing.  Beyond  this,  the  NAACP's  requested  rehabilitation \nof  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  units  would  not  realistically  impact  the \nhomeless  problem,  as  acknowledged  by  the  NAACP's  counsel  at  oral \nargument. \nThis  is  because  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  units,  even  if \nrehabilitated,  cannot  be  offered  to  homeless  families.  Under \nexisting federal  law and  regulations,  the Minneapolis  Public  Housing \nAuthority  cannot  offer  such  units  to  families  living  in  homeless \nshelters.  The  units  simply  cannot  be  given  to  the  homeless.  The \nNAACP  finally argues  that  some  of  the  housing  vacated by  those  who \nmove  into  the  rehabilitated units  may  become  available  to  home]PRR \n13 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 14 of 19\npersons.  This  argument  places  conjecture  on  top  of  conjecture  to \nreach  an  unwarranted  conclusion. \nThe  Decree  does  not  address  the  issue  of  homelessness.  Thus, \nthe  increase  in  homelessness  does  not  represent  the  sort  of \n\"significant change\"  that  \"warrants  revision of  the  decree.\"  Rufo, \n502  U.S.  at  393.  Even  if the  Court  rewrote  the  Decree  as  the  NAACP \nasks,  it would  not  ameliorate  the  homelessness  problem.  Such  an \naction would not  be  \"suitably tailored to the  changed  circumstance.\" \nId.  at  391. \nThe  NAACP • s  last  rationale  for  modification  of  the  Consent \nDecree  is  \"the  slow pace  of  reconstruction.\"  This  rationale,  too, \nfails  as  a  basis  for  modifying  the  Decree.  This  is  because  the \nDecree,  itself,  anticipates  that  demolition  of  old  units  will \noutpace  the  construction  of  new  units.  It  states  that  \"where \npossible,  permanent  replacement  units  will  be  created  prior  to \nscheduled demolition. \"3  (Consent  Decree,  ~ 28)  (emphasis  supplied). \nBut  at  the  same  time,  it  specifically  provides  for  residents  who \nmust  be  relocated  due  to  demolition  before  replacement  units  are \n3The  Court  is not,  however,  blind to the  fact  that Minneapolis \nhas  provided only  eight  replacement  units  since  demolition  began. \nWhile  the  question  is not  immediately before  the  Court,  this  sorry \nhistory might  well  fall  within  the  Consent  Decree's  four  corners. \nAt  oral  argument,  counsel  for  the  Minneapolis  Public  Housing \nJ)..11rhnri t-_y  ( \"MPHA\")  assured  the  Court  that  at  least  eighty  such \nunits  will  be  on-line  within  a  year's  time. \n14 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 15 of 19\navailable.  (IQ.  at~ 28-30.) \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  made  it clear  that,  as  a  general  rule, \n\"modification  [of  a  consent  decree]  should  not  be  granted  where  a \nparty relies upon  events  that  actually were  anticipated at  the  time \nit  entered  into  a  decree.n  Rufo,  502  U.S.  at  385.  Because  the \nDecree  addresses  the  possibility  of  demolition  outstripping  new \nconstruction,  the  current  conditions  do  not  constitute  the  kind  of \nunanticipated  circumstances  necessary  to  justify  a  modification \nunder  Rule  60(b) (5). \nEven  if the  circumstances  enumerated  by  the  NAACP  justified a \nmodification of  the Decree,  lLs  proposed modification would  directly \nundermine  the  basic purpose  of  the  Decree.  The  NAACP  seeks  an  order \nrequiring  that  a  number  of  housing units  -- units which  have  already \nbeen  condemned,  and  are  now  entirely  unfit  for  habitation  -- be \nrehabilitated  on  a  temporary  basis.  These  units  would  then  be \nreoccupied,  presumably  by  inhabitants  whose  demographics  roughly \nparallel  the  situation which prevailed at  the  time  this  case  began. \nThis  is  the  same  situation which  the  NAACP's  original  lawsuit \nclaimed  to be  an unconstitutional  over-concentration of  low-income \nminority  families  in  public  housing.  It  further  claimed  the \nsituation resulted  from  de  jure and  de  facto  discrimination.  This \ncondition should not  now  be  reimposed  at  the  NAACP's  rPCJllPRt.. \n15 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 16 of 19\nThe  NAACP  has  failed  to  present  any  authority  empowering  the \nCourt  to  grant  its  motion  to  modify  the  Consent  Decree.  As  a \nresult,  the  motion  must  be  denied. \nB.  The  Preliminary  Injunction \nThe  NAACP  seeks  an order enjoining the  City of Minneapolis  from \ndemolishing  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  units.  The  Eighth  Circuit  Court \nof Appeals  has  set  forth  the  standard  to  be  considered  in deciding \nsuch  a  motion.  The  Court  must  consider  four  factors:  ( 1)  the \nthreat  of  irreparable  harm  to  the  movant;  (2)  the  balance  between \nthat  threat  of  harm  and  the  injury that granting  the  injunction will \ninflict  on  the  other parties;  (3)  Lhe  pi.-obability  the  movant  will \nsucceed  on  the  merits;  and  ( 4)  the  public  interest.  Dataphase \nSystems.  Inc.  v.  CL  Systems.  Inc.,  640  F.2d  109,  113  (8th  Cir. \n1981) .  Applying  these  factors,  the  Court  finds  none  favoring  a \ngrant  of  the  motion. \nFirst,  when  considering the  threat of harm  to the  moving  party, \nthe  Court  acknowledges  that demolition of  a  building  is  irreparable. \nBut  the NAACP  has  failed  to  show  how,  in the  context  of  the  consent \nDecree,  it  will  suffer  harm  from  the  demolition.  The  Decree,  to \nwhich  the  NAACP  originally  gave  its  assent,  calls  for  this \ndemolition.  And,  ultimately,  the parties are  aware  that  many  of  the \nnew  replacement  unite  will  be  built  on  the  vacated  site.  This \n16 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 17 of 19\nreconstruction,  at  least  in part,  depends  on  that  demolition. \nAs  for  the  balance  between  the  harm  to  the  moving  party, \nbalanced  against  the  harm  to  the  other  parties,  it  is  clear  that \nstopping  demolition  will  likely  jeopardize  this  entire  complex \nredevelopment  program.  While  there  is a  very scant  record,  at  oral \nargument  it was  clear there  is a  development  contract  in place.  A \ncontract  lapse,  or a  breakdown of  the project,  could well  substitute \na  long-term disaster  for  a  short-term  \"solution.\" \nThird,  as  seen  above,  the  movant's  probability of  success  on \nthe  merits  is  extremely  low.  Its  request  does  not  comply  with \neither  the  Consent  DecL-ee  or  the  Supreme  Court's  rule  in  Rufo  v. \nInmates  of  Suffolk  County  Jail,  502  U.S.  367,  393  (1992).  The \nCourt's  analysis  of  the  law  shows  that  this  Dataphase  factor \ncounsels  denial  of  the  motion. \nFinally,  the  Court  considers  the  public  interest.  The  public \ndoes  not,  and  indeed  cannot,  have  an  interest  in  seeing  the  Court \noverstep  the  bounds  of  its  authority  in  a  system  of  separated \npowers.  Beyond  this,  in  a  representative  democracy,  the  public's \ninterest  is  usually  expressed  by  the  decisions  of  its  elected \nofficials.  While  their views  are  not  determinative,  virtually all \nof  them were  elected when  they  entered  into  the  Consent  Decree  and \nhave,  to  a  large  extent,  been  re-elected  sinrp_  Hnth  in policy and \n17 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 18 of 19\nin  fact,  the  public  interest  weighs  against  the  grant  of  the \ninjunction. \nHaving  denied  the  motion  to  modify  the  Consent  Decree,  no \nreason  for  delay  of  the  demolition  exists.  Therefore,  the  Court \nexpects  the  parties  will  move  with  dispatch  to  effectuate  the \nDecree's  terms.  The  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction  to  halt \ndemolition of  the  Glenwood/Lyndale  housing  projects  is denied. \nIII.  Conclusion \nIn  the  last  analysis,  the  NAACP  does  not  ask  the  Court  simply \nto  enjoin  demolition.  It  asks  the  Court  to  find  funds  to  finance \nthe  rehabilitation  of  unsafe  and  uninhabitable  housing  units.  It \nthen  asks  the  Court  to  reimpose  the  same  racially and  economically \nimpacted  public  housing  conditions  which  led  it,  among  others,  to \nbring  its initial claims  of  constitutional deprivation.  The  NAACP's \n\"solution\"  would  undermine,  and  ultimately eviscerate,  the  central \npurpose  of  the  Consent  Decree.  Even  if the  Court  had  the  authority, \nor  was  given  an  arguable  justification  for  imposing  such  a \nmodification,  it would  decline  -- indeed,  it would  be  compelled  to \ndecline  -- to  do  so. \nAccordingly,  IT  IS  ORDERED  that: \n1.  Plaintiff's motion  for  a  preliminary injunction is denied. \n2.  Plaintiff's motion  to modify  thP  rnnRPnt  Decree  is denied. \n18 \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 182   Filed 09/30/99   Page 19 of 19\n3.

There were actually 3 78 units available for occupancy on that \ndate.  By letter dated May 10, 2002, Class plaintiffs invoked the dispute resolution process \npursuant to paragraph 97 of the Decree and indicated class plaintiffs' intent to proceed to court to \nenforce the Decree and/or seek a determination that MPHA should be held in contempt unless \nthe alleged failure to comply with paragraph 44 of the decree could be remedied. \nThe MPHA denies that it is in contempt and asserts that under a HUD definition there \nwere an additional 42 units available for occupancy and that, in any event, there are currently \n433 units available for occupancy.  The MPHA and the class plaintiffs agree that the MPHt\\ \nmust substantially rely on  suburban jurisdictions to produce units outside ofMinncapolis and \nthat a variety of unexpected problems associated with production by these jurisdictions has \nslowed replacement housing efforts.  The MPHA and the class plaintiffs further agree that the \ncomplexities of redevelopment of the northside site have resulted in slower than projected \nproduction of replacement units on that site and that the MPHA' s ability to produce replacement \nunits on this site depends, in part, on the actions of a variety of other entities, both parties and \nnon-parties. \nThe MPHA and class plaintiffs agree that one of the problems demonstrated by the \ncurrent dispute over an alleged shortfall in public housing units is that there are not adequate \nmechanisms in place to identify problems, including problems attributable to other entities. \nwhich might lead to future Decree violations.  As a result, such problems cannot be effectively \naddressed until Decree deadlines may have already passed.  The MPHA and class plaintiff:; \nfurther agree that a mechanism is needed to identity potential barriers to timely complianc(~ as \nearly as possible so that timely corrective action can be taken in order to  avoid a potential \nDecree violation. \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 229   Filed 01/07/03   Page 3 of 8\nThe MPHA and the class plaintiffs hereby enter into this Stipulation in order to resolve \nthe class plaintiffs' dispute resolution notice and to adopt procedures which will address tht: \nproblems created by future unexpected production issues and will help assure that the MPHA \nmeets the September, 2004 deadline for production of the remaining replacement units. \nFurther, class plaintiffs and the MPHA agree that the agreement defining the timing of \ndistribution of certificates and housing counseling services entered into previously pursuart to \nparagraph 67 of the decree is obsolete and that, for a variety of reasons, the agreed upon schedule \nfor use of section 8 resources has not been met to date.  In order to adopt a new schedule for use \nof these resources and to assure that MPHA's obligations with respect to the Hollman vouchers \nare complete by October 31, 2004, as previously stipulated among the parties, the MPHA and the \nclass plaintiffs hereby enter into this Stipulation. \n~For purposes of this Stipulation, defendants McCorvey and MPHA shall be referred to \nbelow as \"MPH A.\" \nClass plaintiffs and MPHA hereby agree as follows: \n1.  Production of replacement units currently scheduled to be replaced outside of \nMinneapolis.  The MPHA currently intends that an additional 126 units be produced \noutside ofMinneapolis.  Seventy four (74) of these are under construction or are th'~ \nsubject of purchase agreements and awaiting closings.  An additional 17 are in mix,~d \nfinance projects which have received funding and are expected to close by Februar~r \n2003.  An additional  28 are under contract with the Metropolitan Council HRA.  L p to \nan additional 17 are under contract with Metropolitan Housing Resources (MHR).  The \nMPHA will look to MHR for l 0 of these, if at all, only if sufficient units are not \ncommitted in Minneapolis by May 31, 2003.  The MPHA will provide monthly reports \nto plaintiffs on the status of each of these production programs.  The MPHA will \npromptly notifY the plaintiffs in writing as soon as possible of any occurrences which \npotentially threaten the timely completion of these units.  Where such occurrences are \n\nCASE 4:92-cv-00712-JMR-FLN   Document 229   Filed 01/07/03   Page 4 of 8\nidentified, the MPHA wi11 produce written strategies to address such occurrences so as to \nensure timely completion of the affected units.  The MPHA acknowledges that \nacquisition of scattered site units in Minneapolis by the MPHA may be necessary if it \nappears that these units will not be completed by September of2004.  The MPHA will \nmeet with plaintiffs in March of2003, September of2003, and March of2004 to review \nprogress on these units and to confer as to whether it will be necessary to initiate a \nMinneapolis scattered site acquisition program by the MPHA. \n2.
