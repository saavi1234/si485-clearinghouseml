    "summary": "<p>These are two cases about housing segregation in New York City.</p><p>On January 31, 1990, two black and Hispanic individuals residing in or eligible for New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) housing (\"the <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs\") filed a class action lawsuit against the NYCHA under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (FHA), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981-83. Represented by the Legal Aid Society, the <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs alleged that, since 1983, the Housing Authority discriminated on the basis of race, color, and national origin against black and Hispanic tenants in the selection and assignment of public housing by restricting certain housing projects to white tenants, using racial goals or targets for new projects, and assigning families to projects with no vacancies.</p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Pierre N. Leval. The <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs amended their complaint on May 31, 1990, and the defendants answered February 28, 1991. We do not have access to these early trial documents.</p><p>On July 1, 1992, the U.S. filed its own lawsuit against the NYCHA. Besides the initial trial documents in the U.S. government's case, all of the filings in <i>U.S. v. NYC Housing Authority</i> were originally filed in <i>Davis v. NYC Housing Authority</i>.</p><p>Also on July 1, 1992, the parties filed a proposed consent decree resolving all of the plaintiffs' claims. Under the decree, the NYCHA would agree to certify a class, provide priority placement for 1,990 adversely affected families at 31 public housing projects, and pay for moving expenses. HUD would also provide 200 Section 8 housing vouchers for use in the private housing market by families who were adversely affected during 1983-1984. The consent decree also stipulated that a \"Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan\" (TSAP) would be created to prohibit past practices and provide more information for black and Hispanic families would might be otherwise unaware of certain housing opportunities. In exchange, the plaintiffs waived monetary damages to unnamed class members, partial relief for 1983-1984, and relief for some largely non-white housing projects in East Harlem. 1992 WL 420923.</p><p>As part of the class certification process, the court held a hearing on November 6, 1992, to determine if certifying the proposed plaintiff class would be \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). We don't have access to documents specifying how the parties defined the class. Shortly after, the court approved the consent decree on November 16. The court also issued a judgment that the defendant would pay monetary damages of $60,000 and attorneys' fees of $40,000 plus the cost of a toll-free telephone. On December 31, the court published its findings of fact and conclusions of law. In its opinion, it found that the consent decree was a reasonable compromise because of the value provided to the plaintiffs and the potential risks and delays associated with litigation. 1992 WL 420923.</p><p>The defendant filed a motion to clarify the consent decree. In response, the U.S. moved to enjoin the defendant from moving forward with its tenanting plan at its Berry Street Project on October 19, 1993, and the <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs followed with a cross motion for a permanent injunction the next day. The U.S. also filed a motion on November 4 in support of enforcing the consent decree. On December 2, the court granted the defendant's motion and clarified some procedural questions surrounding the TSAP and transfer applications. However, the court also found that the defendant's plan to use dual lists for \"Larger Apartments\" at its the Berry Street Project were not consistent with the consent decree, and issued a preliminary injunction. 839 F.Supp.215 (S.D.N.Y. 1993). The court's order was filed on December 30.</p><p>Three days earlier, on December 27, 1993, the defendant submitted a proposed settlement to answer the motions filed in the preceding months. Both the <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs and the U.S. replied with a counterproposal on January 4, 1994.</p><p>In October 1996, letters from the plaintiffs and defendant were filed in both cases regarding proposed changes to the TSAP from the NYCHA, resulting in a pre-trial conference on October 28. On November 15, the <i>Davis</i> plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the NYCHA from implementing those modifications to the TSAP.</p><p>On July 18, 1997, the court issued an opinion in response to a motion from the plaintiffs. The court enjoined the NYCHA from implementing a \"Working Family Preference\" (WFP), which altered the factors determining whether an applicant would be granted an interview and gave preference to families who could pay the most. However, the court did permit the NYCHA to expand its \"Project Choice\" to allow larger families to specify preferences for projects. 1997 WL 407250. The defendants filed a motion on August 4 for the district court to reconsider, but the court denied the motion on November 17, with an amended opinion filed on November 20. However, the court did modify the preliminary injunction so that the NYCHA was permitted to implement the WFP in projects where fewer than 30% of the families were white. 1997 WL 711360.</p><p>Later that year, the defendant appealed the court's denial of their reconsider motion to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, with an amended notice dated December 3, 1997. On January 22, 1999, the Court of Appeals vacated the district court's opinion from July 18, 1997, citing the district court's lack of detail in concluding that the NYCHA's proposed plan would perpetuate segregation. It left the preliminary injunction intact, but remanded the case. For the remand, the Second Circuit requested that the district court develop sufficient precision around which parts of the proposed modifications would perpetuate segregation and what exactly the impact would be. The appeals court also asked for more detail regarding the data and methodology used in the statistical analysis that showed the potential impact of the proposed changes. 60 F.Supp.2d 220 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).</p><p>The remand was filed on February 18, 1999, and a hearing in the district court was held on June 18. The district court issued its opinion on August 11, denying the defendant's motion to lift the preliminary injunction and granting the plaintiff's motion to make the preliminary injunction a permanent injunction. <i>Id</i>.</p><p>In response, the defendant appealed on September 3, 1999. The Court of Appeals issued an order in the case on February 23, 2000. It asked for move-out figures under the WFP, how the WFP would affect each housing project's speed at which it achieved a white occupancy rate under 30%, and a more accurate estimate for the white admissions rate under the WFP. 205 F.Supp.3d 1322 (2d Cir. 2000). On remand in June 2000, the district court found that the updated numbers did not change the conclusion that the WFP would significantly perpetuate discrimination. 103 F.Supp.2d 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).</p><p>After this district court ruling, the defendant appealed again. On January 3, 2002, the Court of Appeals found the district court's updated numbers and analysis to be satisfactory, and determined that the district court was correct in concluding that the WFP would cause legally significant delays in desegregation. As a result, the Court of Appeals affirmed the injunction. 278 F.Supp.3d 64 (2d Cir. 2002).</p><p>On March 7, 2002, the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, which denied the petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2002.</p><p>In addition to the permanent injunction, the court awarded monetary relief. On August 2, 2002, the plaintiff filed for $568,725.81 in attorneys' fees, costs, and other expenses. On December 11, the district court awarded $306,467.75 in attorneys' fees, $2,273.74 in Westlaw fees, $70.33 in long distance telephone charges, and $84.50 in travel and postage charges. This total amounted to $308,896.32 in attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.</p><p>This case has finished.</p>",

    "summary_short": "These are two cases about housing segregation in New York City. On January 31, 1990, two black and Hispanic individuals residing in or eligible for New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) housing filed a class action lawsuit against the NYCHA under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981-83. On July 1, 1992, the U.S. filed its own lawsuit against the NYCHA. The plaintiffs alleged that, since 1983, the Housing Authority discriminated on the basis of race, color, and national origin against black and Hispanic tenants in the selection and assignment of public housing. The court approved a consent decree on November 16, 1992, and this included creating a \"Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan\" to prohibit past practices. However, the court found some of the defendant's subsequent tenanting plans to be inconsistent with the consent decree, and issued a preliminary injunction on December 2, 1993. After a series of appeals and remands, the court turned the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction on August 11, 1999. In addition to the permanent injunction, the court awarded monetary relief totaling $308,896.32 for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. This case has finished.",

(Consent Decree ¶4(a)-(h)).\nThe Consent Decree provided  inter   alia  for: (1) injunctive relief\nbarring future housing discrimination on the basis of race, color\nor ofimplementation the (2) ¶4); Decree (Consent origin, national  \nandselection tenant NYCHA’s revised asubstantially which TSAP new  \nassignment  systems, and which prohibits further discrimination,\n(Consent ofclaimants 2,190 for relief remedial (3) 5-9); ¶¶ Decree  \nNYCHA’s  past discrimination, 4  (Consent Decree ¶¶ 10-39); and (4)\nsignificant tenantregarding NYCHA by reporting and keeping record  \nselection and assignment practices.

The Working Family Preference\nIn   July  1995,  NYCHA  proposed  to  change  the  TSAP  by\nadopting  the WFP.  The essential difference between the original\nTSAP need\"applicant's the of elimination WFP's the is WFP the and  \nfor housing\" as a priority.  Instead, the WFP gives preference to\nfamilies priorityTSAP, original the under Thus,  income. on based  \nwas  afforded to families who needed housing the most.  Under the\nWFP, thepay can who families to afforded is priority contrast, in  \nmost, regardless of their housing need.\n      5 The TSAP was designed \"to assure that [the Housing Authority] receives and processes\nsnoitacilppa § ,PAST  \".swal eht htiw ecnadrocca ni dna yltneiciffe gnisuoh cilbup lanoitnevnoc rof \nI at 1.\n\nIn   Davis  II ,  this Court described the operation of the\nWFP as follows:\nNYCHA theof part as priorities local new establish would  \napplicant prioritylocal highest The  process. selection  \nwould   be  assigned  to  the  highest  income,  Tier  III\napplicants.

The\nDavis   Plaintiffs  concede  the  proposed  objectives  of  the  WFP,\nnamely, income integration in public housing and increasing the\nnumber of working families in public housing, are legitimate, but\nco ntend  that  the  NYCHA  has  not  sustained  its  burden  of\ndemonstrating   that  there  is  no  less  discriminatory  means  of\nadvancing the same interests.  Plaintiffs proposed an alternative\nmethod  of increasing the representation of upper income families\n\nthat  would have a less racially discriminatory effect than the\nproposed WFP, a method which NYCHA has rejected.\nC. The Effect of the Working Family Preference\nAccording movedfamilies 5,885 tapes, computer NYCHA's to  \ninto NYCHA apartments during 1995.  The racial breakdown of those\nfamilies, occurredhave would that breakdown racial the with along  \nif the WFP had been in effect during that year, are summarized in\nthe following table:\n\nTable 1\nRace Distribution of 1995 Rentals Under Original TSAP and WFP\nAfrican- Puerto Other\nWhite American Rican Hispanic Other Total\nOriginal\nTSAP  250 2703 1768 860 340 5885\nWFP  580 2594 1339 835 537 5885\nDifference 330 -109 -429 -25 233   0\nFor   future  projections,  Dr.  Cupingood  assumed  that\nfamilies of each race will make decisions about which projects to\nchoose  in the same manner, and with the same probabilities, as\nfamilies of that race have done in the past.\nNYCHA  records move-outs and move-ins by race for each\nproject NYCHA's Race.\" by Statistics \"Tenant entitled, report a in  \nexpert,  Dr. Peterson, annexed such reports as Exhibit E to his\nJanuary 7, 1999 affidavit.  Dr. Cupingood relied on these reports\nin   his  original  affidavit  and  in  this  report  in  calculating\nexpected move-out and move-in rates.\nTo  calculate the probable number of white move-outs at\neach Disproportionate Project, Dr. Cupingood began by selecting a\nperiod   for  historical  reference.    Since  Davis  claimants  began\nmoving  into Affected Developments in August 1995, the last year\nthat   is  free  of  distortion  by  Davis  move-ins  is  1994.\nAdditionally,  since the bulk of NYCHA's discriminatory practices\n\nended bycaused distortion of free is that year first the 1990, in  \nNYCHA's selectedCupingood Dr. Thus,  1991. was discrimination own  \nthe years 1991 through 1994 as a period for historical reference.\nFor  each Disproportionate Project, Dr. Cupingood then\ncalculated  move-out rates based on NYCHA's Tenant Statistics by\nRace   for  the  period  1991  through  1994.    For  example,  if  the\npopulation 5if and 100, was 1991 of beginning the at project a of  \nfamilies at1991 for rate move-out the then 1991, during out moved  \nthat   project  was  5  percent  (Cupingood  Report,  ¶8).

He then determined the probable\nnumber   of  white  move-outs  at  each  project  in  a  given  year  by\napplying the appropriate turnover percentage to the population at\nthe end of the year.  (Cupingood Report, ¶9).\nUsing   the  historical  period  1991-1994,  Dr.  Cupingood\ndetermined  the total number of move-ins of each race into each\nproject. whitefor total the of percentage the determined then He   \nand Project.Disproportionate each into moved who non-whites   6 For  \n      6 Three areaWilliamsburg the in Projects Disproportionate  \nof  Brooklyn required special consideration during this analysis.\nOn   April  17,  1991,  NYCHA  settled  a  contempt  motion  with  the\nplaintiffs  in  Williamsburg  Fair Housing Comm. v.

The Issues\nAs  noted, the Second Circuit has held that the proper\nstandard to be applied on remand is \"whether the proposed working\nfamily will preference   significantly theat segregation perpetuate  \nrelevant  NYCHA developments.\"   Davis  IV ,  166 F.3d at 438.  NYCHA\nhas urged that the remediation required by the Consent Decree has\nbeen   achieved  and  that  therefore  there  is  no  perpetuation  of\nsegregation which could result from the WFP and no discrimination\nremaining addition,In  Decree. Consent the under remediated be to  \nthe  Authority contends that if there is segregation extant under\nthe  Consent Decree the WFP does not significantly perpetuate it.\nThe  Davis Plaintiffs take the contrary view of the issues.  The\nquestions to be resolved therefore are:\n1. Is there a basis upon which to conclude that there\nis  segregation to be dealt with under the Consent\nDecree?\n2. Does the WFP significantly perpetuate segregation?\n\nII.  There is Segregation to be Dealt with under the Consent\nDecree\nA. 30 WhichBy Metric the as Used Be Will Percent  \nSegregation Will Be Determined in this Case\nAs  an initial matter, the parties disagree as to the\nappropriate measure for assessing whether segregation exists.

States   , 681-673, U.S. 402  \n82 (1971).  The Consent Decree is not limited to the relief to be\nprovided  to the  Davis  class members.  It also includes extensive\ninjunctive   relief  designed  to  address  the  past  discriminatory\nactions   of  the  NYCHA  and  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  a  non-\ndiscriminatory system and the elimination of segregation.\n For example, NYCHA is \"permanently enjoined from . . .\nadopting   and  implementing  any  tenant  application,  selection,\nassignment, whichprocess, or policy such any or plan, transfer and  \ngives  preference to Applicants or tenants on the basis of race,\ncolor,   or  national  origin.\"    Consent  Decree,  ¶4(a).    Other\npermanent  injunctive provisions bar NYCHA from refusing to make\nrentals   or  transfers  on  the  basis  of  race  (¶4(b));  making\nstatements  indicating a preference or limitation based on race\n(¶4(c));  representing on account of race that apartments are not\n\nanticipating   vacancies  when  they  are,  in  fact,  anticipating\nvacancies (¶4(d)); and a number of other limitations.\nThese   injunctions  apply  not  just  to  the  Affected\nDevelopments   as  defined  in  ¶1(b)  --  and  indeed,  not  just  to\n\"Conventional ofall to but -- ¶1(h) in defined as Housing\" Public  \nNYCHA's  housing, \"conventional or otherwise\" (¶4), by requiring\nNYCHA to operate a race-neutral tenant-selection system at all of\nits housing projects.\nUnder   the  Consent  Decree,  these  permanent  injunctive\nprovisions  may not be construed to bar remedial relief to others\nwho 4(j)Paragraph  Decree.

NYCHA is also enjoined from\nreferring ofbecause projects particular to turn of out applicants  \nrace (¶7(c)).

The  WFP Will Significantly Perpetuate Segregation\nat the Affected Projects\nAn   action  that  perpetuates  existing  patterns  of\nsegregati on violates the Fair Housing Act.   See   Huntington ,  844\nF.2d   at  937  ( citing   Metropolitan   Housing  Development  Corp.  v.\nVillage  of Arlington Heights ,  548 F.2d 1283, 1290 (1989).  The\n\ndeterminative   issue  here  is  whether  the  proposed  WFP  will\n“ significantly   perpetuate  segregation  at  the  relevant  NYCHA\ndevelopments.”   Davis  IV ,  166 F.3d at 438.  While the parties\ndisagree somewhat on the methodology employed and the accuracy of\nthe thisin quarrels real the experts, the by presented statistics  \naction   are  legal.    Specifically,  the  NYCHA  asserts  that  even\naccepting   arguendo ofeffect projected the figures, Cupingood’s Dr.  \nthe  WFP is  de   minimis .   Plaintiffs counter that the WFP would\n“severely   impair”  desegregation  at  the  21  Disproportionate\nProjects,   and  that  the  impact  would  be  “significant”  whether\nmeasured in absolute numbers or by standard statistical tests.\n  \nA.

Where a court-ordered plan intended to eradicate past\nsegregation tochange proposed a here, as where, and effect, in is  \nthe  plan is alleged to perpetuate past segregation, the Supreme\nCourt has compared the results under the proposed plan with those\nunder the original, court-ordered plan. 14\nSeveral school-desegregation cases are illustrative. In\nWright Emporiaof City the of Council v.   , for(1972), 451 U.S. 407  \nexample, toVirginia County, Greensville ordered court district the  \n      14 evnoC ntionally,  the  adverse   impact   of  an  applicant selection process in housing and\ntnemyolpme rieht naht rewol etar a ta nesohc era stnacilppa ytironim rehtehw yb denimreted si sesac \nlanoitroporp  noita t nneiser p ee thrlntla ac.rilelovpooppa  eeS ,   e.g. ,   detinU  States v.

After the district court issued\nits County,Greensville within located Emporia, of City the order,  \nimplemented parentsand system, school separate a operate to plans  \nin  Greensville County were invited to send their children to the\nEmporia  schools.

See   407  U.S.  at  457-58\n(comparing withdecree desegregation the by contemplated statistics  \nthose contemplated by the change).\nSimilarly, in  United States v. Scotland Neck City Board\nof   Educ. ,   407  U.S.  484  (1972),  the  county  of  Halifax,  North\nCarolina  reached an agreement with the United States regarding a\nso-called theAfter  segregation. past eradicate to Plan” “Interim  \nInterim Plan had been submitted to the school board, but before a\nvote billa enacted Legislature Carolina North the taken, be could  \npermitting schoolseparate a establish to Neck Scotland of City the  \nsystem.   Sustaining the district court’s preliminary injunction\nagainst   the  change  because  it  would  impede  desegregation,  the\nSupreme PlanInterim the under enrollments projected compared Court  \nwith those under the challenged plan.   See  407 U.S. at 489-90\n(comparing challengedunder that with Plan Interim under enrollment  \nplan).\n\nAccordingly, significantlyWFP the whether evaluating in  \nperpetuates   segregation,  the  relevant  comparison  will  be  the\ndesegregation that would be achieved under the original TSAP with\nthe projected effect of the WFP.\nB. White Decline Under the WFP\nNYCHA ratesoccupancy white the as long so that contends  \nwould  decline under the WFP, regardless of the rate of decline,\nthen   the  WFP  cannot  be  said  to  perpetuate  segregation.    ( See\nPeterson Third Aff. ¶¶ 7 and 23(a)).  Plaintiffs assert that this\nposition makes “little sense” and offer the following example:\nAssume compositionracial current the that hypothetically  \nof  Project X is 50 percent white and that all projects\nmore than 30 percent white reflect the vestiges of past\nsegregation.     Also  assume  that  without  the  WFP,  the\npercent  [of] white[s] at Project X will decline by 4\npercent per year, and would thus reach 30 percent white\nin five years.  Finally, assume that under the WFP, the\npercen t white would decline by only 1 percent per year\nand  would thus reach 30 percent white in 20 years. Dr.\nPeterson would claim that the WFP did not perpetuate\nsegregation wouldX Project at white percent the because  \nstill  decline under the WFP, no matter how slowly.  He\nwould ofvestiges the that fact the irrelevant as dismiss  \nsegregation would persist for an additional 15 years.\nBut “perpetuate” means to extend in time.\n(Cupingood Fourth Aff. ¶8).\nThe  relevant inquiry here is not whether desegregation\n\nwill occur   eventually delaysignificantly will ,WFP the whether but  \nd esegregation at the Disproportionate Projects.   See   Monroe  v.\nBoard Commissionersof   ,becannot it (“if (1968) 459 450, U.S. 391  \nshown toconversion delay than rather further will plan a such that  \na unitary, nonracial, nondiscriminatory school system, it must be\nheld  unacceptable.”);  Wright ,  407 U.S. at 460 (“if the proposal\nwould districtthe then system, dual the of dismantling the impede  \ncourt . . . may enjoin it from being carried out”). 15\nAs   noted,  this  Court  has  adopted  Dr.  Cupingood’s\nconclusion that:\nassuming persistrates move-in and turnover existing that  \nand that for each vacancy set aside for claimants under\nthe   Davis whitea replace would color of family a decree,  \nfamily, implementation of the Working Family Preference\nwould effectively “freeze” the desegregation process at\nthe Titleof violation in projects, identifiable racially  \nVIII. thishave will Preference Family Working The  ....  \neffect because it will more than double white admission\n      15 ev ashtru oycnaM tsni asgnaoit c.nnu ojintIager gy ea eslrdeoe dpt masihetcitc adrepnio jne\ne c  nid soteeeicgrstan eaareehcnplhwilt m a yithelrncstcein sm resiynauedoiqc leieprtsmfceeahrtp\nsedepmi   .ecrofkrow eht fo noitargetni etautceffe ot yrassecen snoitomorp ro gnirih  aibaraS odeloT .v \neciloP n ’ss’snAamlo rtaP , 601 F.2d 914 (6 ht   . neIvitartsul l si)i97 9.1r iC aibaraS  , atnesnoc  eerced\ndah    dneete pboo  td”e“anso ais r teyenagniniai  t mtfs einoeohre vedtcmtcesysilioalodlpoTppme\n.ecrof egatnecrep eht ,eerced eht rednu noitarepo fo sraey flah-eno dna eerht retfA  .519 ta d2.F 106  \neht hgufoohtla ,tnecrep 4.8 ylno ot tnecrep 7 morf desaercni ecrof ecilop eht no snaciremA-nacirfA \nnoitalupop tah tdegrah csffitnial peh  T.naciremA-nacirf Atnecre p4 1yletamixorpp asa wodelo Tf o\na   l ievci icgvnrie rs,iehlur  deehlt lealcu-ro“s f o” ,neoeir th satgagn weifrdogeepsme idehtecilop\n.ecrof  n  o g it s nttnf ediaa eog  ged  hnemnee iyufet ihyihltalohtmtortuslctsilireenalphvdopemCe\n,noitanimircsid .elur ecivres livic eht gnidnepsus redro s’truoc tcirtsid eht deniatsus tiucriC htxiS eht \ngninilced ylwols saw ecrof eht no setihIwd. fo egatnecrep eht taht esnefed on saw ti ,ylbatoN  .916 ta \ne hhtt inweve  .e c  aen llidpuergnell ahc eeS  osla  be e .Ndveti nsUrehto rkBca lyBt isCsalG , 540 F.\n .ppuS 258 .D.N( oihO ;)2891 .fc  tsiuq  y.rNvuhtrA , 712 F.2d 816 (2d Cir. 1983).\n\nrates many16that demonstrate trends existing because and  \nof these additional white families will be concentrated\nin predominantly white developments.\nDavis II , 1997 WL 407250 at *12.\nC.

However, this contention is\nerroneous.     When  Dr.  Cupingood  prepared  his  report,  the  most\nrecently  available Tenant Statistics by Race report was for June\n30,   1998.    ( See   Cupingood  Third  Aff.  ¶  7).    At  each\nDisproportionate   Project  that  was  also  a  Davis   Affected\nDevelopment, indicatedwhites of number the adjusted Cupingood Dr.  \non  the June 30, 1998 report downward to reflect all future  Davis\nclaimant ( move-ins.

Third Peterson  \nDr.  Peterson compared two completely unrelated figures: (1) the\nadjustm ent to account for housing of all future  Davis  claimants\nprior  to any post-June 30, 1998 activity; and (2) the figure for\nactual  changes  in  the  white  population  caused  by  post-June  30\nactivit y,  but  prior  to  housing  all  Davis   claimants.    This\ncomparison is meaningless.\n\nAccordingly, theby caused desegregation in reduction the  \nWFP is statistically significant.\n2. Legal Significance\nWhile establishto necessary is significance statistical  \nlegal   significance,  it  is  not  sufficient.    It  must  thus  be\ndetermined   whether  the  statistically  significant  difference\noccas ioned by the WFP is of ample magnitude to be of practical\nimportance.   This, of course, is a value judgment.  There is no\nbright   line  rule  for  assessing  whether  the  perpetuation  of\nsegregation is legally significant.\nNYCHA populationwhite on effect WFP’s the that contends  \ndecline notdo and significant as characterized be to minor too is  \noutweigh the WFP’s undisputed salutary effects.  According to Dr.\nCupingood,  for 13 of the 21 projects, the difference in white\ndecline with the WFP in effect over five years would be 4 percent\nor whitein difference the projects, eight remaining the At  less.  \ndecline casessuch Citing  percent. 10.7 to percent 5.4 from ranges  \nas   Huntington , and 934, at F.2d 844   Metropolitan Housing  , F.2d558  \nat  1291, NYCHA concludes that “federal courts have much larger\nd iscrepancies in mind when they speak of ‘legally significant’\neffects than the few percentage-point differences involved here.”\n(Defendants’ Brief at 21).\n\nWhi le the Authority is correct that many of the cases\ncited   by  the  parties  involve  larger  discrepancies  than  in  the\ninstant  case, “small” percentage-point differences can result in\nsignificant perpetuation of segregation.  At the Pomonok project,\nfor rateoccupancy white the increase would WFP the where example,  \nby   3.2  percentage  points  after  five  years,  and  5.5  percentage\npoints (years, ten after   see 6),and 4 Tables Aff.

At Pomonok alone, the\nWFP  would deprive non-white families of 66 apartments after five\nyears (  see   id.
