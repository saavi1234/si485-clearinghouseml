    "summary": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a long-running class action brought by people incarcerated in Illinois high-security prisons alleging they were unconstitutionally denied access to the courts in violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The named plaintiff filed the complaint on April 19, 1982 in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois pro se. The plaintiff later obtained counsel. The case was assigned to Judge James Moran, but was later transferred to Judge Elaine Bucklo. The plaintiff alleged he was denied access to the law library while in the segregation unit at the Joliet Correctional Center. As explained in a later court opinion, the plaintiff brought five claims, but three were dismissed in early 1984, leaving two claims pertaining to access to courts. A second named plaintiff then joined, alleging that he too was denied access to the library while in segregation at Joliet. The plaintiffs sought to represent the class of people incarcerated in maximum-security at Joliet. After the first named plaintiff was transferred to Menard Correctional Center, the plaintiffs expanded their case to include the segregation units in all five high-security facilities, which included the Dixon, Stateville, and Pontiac Correctional Centers. The full details of the complaint are unavailable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plaintiffs filed suit against the Governor, the Secretary of State, and various officials of the Department of Corrections (DOC) under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The Governor and Secretary of State were dismissed on August 8, 1985, leaving the DOC officials. The plaintiffs alleged that while in segregation units, they did not have access to the law library and that the clerks who provided them assistance in lieu of accessing the library themselves did not have sufficient training. They alleged this violated their due process right of access to courts established in <em>Bounds v. Smith</em>. The plaintiffs sought class certification, damages, and a preliminary injunction to 1) stop them from being transferred, 2) ensure they had access to their counsel, 3) prevent the removal of the sole trained library clerk, and 4) to establish a training program for clerks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plaintiffs were successful in getting their class certified. On August 8, 1985, the District Court granted class certification for the group: &ldquo;inmates who were or would be in segregation units of maximum security facilities.&rdquo; 615 F.Supp. 330. These facilities included the Joliet, Menard, Dixon, Stateville, and Pontiac Correctional Centers located across Illinois. The judge found the group met the requirements for numerosity, commonality, and typicality under Rule 23. On February 12, 1993, the defendants moved to modify the certified class to exclude people held in segregation units for only minimal periods of time. However, the court denied that motion in its August 28, 1995 opinion, finding it would be impracticable to modify the class in that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction in the August 8, 1985 opinion. The judge reasoned that although the plaintiffs established they were reasonably likely to win on the merits and that they faced a substantial likelihood of irreparable harm, the balance of hardships favored the defendants as it would require them to make premature major changes throughout the state prison system. Pertaining to the merits and potential harm, the judge found that using clerks to bring materials to people in segregation was insufficient, that the photocopy limit per person was inadequate, and that access to phones to speak with counsel was too limited.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both parties then filed motions for summary judgment. The parties&rsquo; cross-motions were denied on April 12, 1991 because there were genuine issues of material fact. Defendants&rsquo; second motion for summary judgment was denied as untimely on November 12, 1991.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accordingly, the parties moved forward with trial preparations. The defendant moved for a jury trial for all issues triable to a jury, which was granted on November 4, 1991. The judge found the defendants did not waive their right to a jury trial. The jury trial was then postponed by joint stipulation, while the injunction portion of the trial, set as a bench trial, was scheduled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The bench trial was held with various continuances from December 2,1991 through July 29, 1992, and again from April 8, 1994 to August 12, 1994. Throughout the course of the trial, witnesses from all five maximum security facilities testified and the parties introduced hundreds of exhibits. On March 5, 1992, the Court ordered that the named plaintiffs, who had been attending trial, be returned to where they were incarcerated because the cost of their transportation/presence outweighed the benefit of their presence at trial. 1992 WL 50987. After the bench trial concluded, there were then many supplemental briefs and hearings concerning evidentiary issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The judge then issued her ruling on August 28, 1995, holding that the defendants did violate the plaintiffs&rsquo; right to meaningful access to courts. The judge went through the findings of fact for each maximum security facility and found that three (Joliet, Menard, and Pontiac) failed to provide access to courts as required by Bounds. Specifically, the judge found that people in segregation were only able to access the law library through clerks and that those clerks were insufficient in number and training and that there was a lack of necessary resources and legal forms. The judge found that one facility, Dixon, did have adequate access to courts. The court deferred making its decision on the final facility, Stateville, until there was more evidence. The defendants moved to amend or vacate the judgment on September 12, 1995, which was denied the same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before the trial, the parties agreed that if the plaintiffs won, they would address the issue of remedies separately. After the court ruled for the plaintiffs, the judge ordered the parties to meet and pick a special master to oversee the plan to bring the institutions into compliance with Bounds. After negotiations, the defendants submitted their remedial relief plan on October 25, 1995.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the parties addressed remedies, the court still needed to complete its determination regarding the Stateville facility. The court held a supplemental hearing concerning Stateville from November 7 to November 9, 1995. However, while the judge considered the evidence about Statesville, the Supreme Court granted cert for<em> Lewis v. Casey</em>, which involved many similar issues to the instant case. Accordingly, the court waited to make its final determination until the Supreme Court issued the Lewis opinion. Lewis was released on June 24, 1996 and held that plaintiffs in a class action must show they suffered actual injury as a result of the alleged access to courts and that a court could only issue system-wide relief for widespread violations of the actual injury plaintiffs suffered. The injury requirement is considered a standing requirement and only one named plaintiff must show injury to establish standing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given the new injury requirement established by Lewis, the judge set a status hearing to discuss the impact of Lewis on the entire case, not just the open Stateville issue. The court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to reopen testimony to allow them to establish actual injury as required by Lewis. At a bench trial from February 24 to February 26, 1997, the plaintiffs presented more testimony to establish injury. The court denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for judgment as a matter of law based on Lewis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On June 27, 1997, the court issued its opinion as to the impact of Lewis on the entire case. 973 F.Supp. 793. The judge found that neither named-plaintiff established injury to meet the Lewis actual injury standing requirement. The judge went through each of the named-plaintiff&rsquo;s claims as to how the lack of access to courts impacted them and found that none caused them to forfeit a non-frivolous claim, which was required to establish actual injury. So, the judge dismissed the case, pertaining to all class members and all five facilities. All pending motions were ordered terminated as moot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on July 7, 1997, arguing that they should have been allowed to replace the named-plaintiffs with other plaintiffs who could establish actual injury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its opinion on December 15, 1998. The panel included Richard Posner, Joel Flaum, and Michael Kinn, with Judge Posner writing the opinion. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court. Judge Posner explained that the named plaintiffs did not demonstrate actual injury to establish standing and that all previous rulings in the litigation had to be vacated. He reasoned that the class lacked standing when the suit was filed, so they could not replace the named-plaintiffs. However, the court clarified that different plaintiffs could file a new case, which would not be precluded. The plaintiffs sought a rehearing en banc, which was denied on January 20, 1999. The plaintiffs then filed a petition for writ of certiorari which was denied on June 3, 1999. The case was closed as of then.</p>",

After a bench trial, the judge found three facilities did violate the plaintiffs' right to access to courts, but requested additional information before making the decision on the fourth facility. While waiting to issue the decision on the fourth facility, the Supreme Court issued Lewis v. Casey, which changed the injury requirements for class actions alleging denial of access to courts. The court found the plaintiffs were not able to establish actual injury as required by Lewis, so the entire case was dismissed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed and the Supreme Court denied cert. The case is now closed.",

These inmates claim that prison officials have blocked\ntheir access to the courts in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted in \nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). After a trial conducted in 1991 and 1992,\nthe district judge found that their right of access had indeed been infringed. Walters v. Edgar, 900 F.Supp. 197\n(N.D.Ill.1995) (see also Walters v. Thompson, 615 F.Supp. 330 (N.D.Ill.1985), finding infringement but denying a\npreliminary injunction). But after the Supreme Court decided Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135\nL.Ed.2d 606 (1996), the judge dismissed the suit on the ground that the named plaintiffs did not have standing to\nmaintain it, Walters v. Edgar, 973 F.Supp. 793 (N.D.Ill. 1997), precipitating this appeal.\nThe plaintiffs argue that even if they do lack standing, the suit should not have been dismissed but instead other\nmembers of the class should have been named as the class representatives. This would indeed have been the\nproper course if something had happened to deprive the named plaintiffs of standing (or otherwise to render them\ninappropriate representatives of the class) after the suit had been filed, provided that two conditions were\nsatisfied: that the suit had been certified as a class action, which would make the unnamed class members\nparties to the suit unless and until they opted out; and that at least one of these unnamed class members had\nstanding. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 51-52, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d 49 (1991); Sosna\nv. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 401, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975); Nelson v. Murphy, 44 F.3d 497, 500 (7th\nCir.1995). What would have saved the suit from dismissal had these two conditions been satisfied would not have\nbeen the principle that jurisdiction once acquired is not defeated by a change of circumstances. Mollan v.\nTorrance, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 537, 539, 6 L.Ed. 154 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.); Smith v. Sperling, 354 U.S. 91, 93 n.\n1, 77 S.Ct. 1112, 1 L.Ed.2d 1205 (1957); Herremans v. Carrera Designs, Inc., 157 F.3d 1118, 1121 (7th Cir.1998)\n. Were that principle applicable, there would be no need to find a class member with standing when the original\nnamed plaintiffs lost their standing after the suit was filed. Like most legal generalizations, however, the principle\nthat jurisdiction once acquired is not defeated by a change of circumstances is not exceptionless. The chief\nexception is that the existence of a case or controversy in the Article III sense, that is, a real dispute between\nparties with tangible stakes in the outcome, Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, ___ U.S. ___, ___-\n___, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1016-17, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112\nS.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), must be continuous from the beginning of the suit to the end. United States\n\nParole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396-97, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980); Church of\nScientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). If a case becomes moot,\nthe court loses jurisdiction, even though the case was not moot when filed.\nIf the district judge was right, these plaintiffs never had standing to bring this suit, and so federal jurisdiction never\nattached. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); Sample v. Aldi Inc., 61\nF.3d 544, 551 (7th Cir.1995); Holmes v. Fisher, 854 F.2d 229, 232-33 (7th Cir.1988); Johnson v. Rodriguez, 110\nF.3d 299, 315 (5th Cir.1997). That makes this the opposite of a case in which jurisdiction is challenged by\n433 developments after the suit was filed. Certification of a class action comes after the suit is filed, so if the named \n*433 plaintiffs lacked standing when they filed the suit, there were no other party plaintiffs to step into the breach\ncreated by the named plaintiffs' lack of standing; and so there was no case when class certification was sought.\nThe danger that a class action will have to be dismissed for lack of standing of the named plaintiffs, even though\nunnamed members of the class might have standing, is another reason, besides those emphasized in Mars Steel\nCorp. v. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., 834 F.2d 677, 680-81 (7th Cir.1987), and Bieneman v. City\nof Chicago, 838 F.2d 962, 964 (7th Cir.1988) (per curiam), for scrupulous adherence to the requirement that the\ndetermination whether to certify a suit as a class action be made \"as soon as practicable after the\ncommencement of the action.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). (It took three years for this case to be certified as a class\naction; but we do not have enough information to enable us to determine whether this was \"as soon as\npracticable,\" given the circumstances.)\nWhitlock v. Johnson, 153 F.3d 380 (7th Cir.1998), illustrates the point that jurisdiction need not lapse just because\nthe named plaintiffs drop out after the suit is filed. The case does not hold or imply, as our plaintiffs argue, that\njurisdiction can be preserved even though the named plaintiffs lacked standing when the suit was filed. Whitlock\nwas a suit alleging a denial of due process in prison disciplinary proceedings. After the suit was brought, the\nnamed plaintiff's challenge to his disciplinary sanction was rejected on the merits; there had been no denial of\ndue process. But since his suit had at least had colorable merit when begun, jurisdiction had attached, albeit the\noriginal plaintiff was no longer a suitable class representative because he no longer had a stake in winning. Had\nhis claim been frivolous, as the district judge found the claims of the named plaintiffs in this case to have been,\nwe would have ordered the Whitlock suit dismissed, because a frivolous suit does not engage the jurisdiction of\nthe federal courts. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, supra, ___ U.S. at ___, 118 S.Ct. at 1010; \nKorzen v. Local Union 705, 75 F.3d 285, 289 (7th Cir.1996); Beauchamp v. Sullivan, 21 F.3d 789 (7th Cir.1994); \nNowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182, 1189 (2d Cir.1996). And it would not matter whether\nthe claim was known at the outset to be frivolous. Until the judgment concluding a suit becomes final by\nexhaustion of all appellate remedies (and sometimes not even then, In re Factor VIII or IX Concentrate Blood\nProducts Litigation, 159 F.3d 1016, 1019 (7th Cir. Oct. 19, 1998); Disher v. Information Resources, Inc., 873 F.2d\n136, 140 (7th Cir.1989)), the existence of jurisdiction over the suit can be challenged. Morel v. INS, 144 F.3d 248,\n250 n. 3 (3d Cir.1998). Therefore the jurisdictional inquiry may be conducted at any time until the judgment\nbecomes final in the sense just indicated. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, supra, ___ U.S. at ___,\n118 S.Ct. at 1011; Levin v. Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Comm'n, 74 F.3d 763, 766 (7th Cir.1996); \nAutocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church v. Goldberg & Feldman Fine Arts, Inc., 917 F.2d 278, 284 n. 7 (7th\nCir.1990); United States v. Bustillos, 31 F.3d 931, 933 (10th Cir.1994).\nA dictum in East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 406 n. 12, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52\nL.Ed.2d 453 (1977), implies that if any members of a class, at the time the class action was certified, had\nstanding, the requirements of Article III are satisfied even if the named plaintiffs were never members of the\nclass. We don't think that this dictum, which is unelaborated, as well as buried in a footnote, can be considered\nauthoritative; it is inconsistent with fundamental principles governing federal jurisdiction. But in any event there is\nno indication that any member of the plaintiff class in the present case sustained any greater injury by reason of\nthe alleged unconstitutional blockage of access to the courts than the two named plaintiffs. So if the named\nplaintiffs lack standing00and we are about to see that they do00the dictum in East Texas could not keep the suit\n97 97\nalive even if that dictum were a holding and so bound us.\nLewis v. Casey, supra, on which the district judge based her decision to dismiss this suit for want of standing,\n434 holds that denial of access to the courts is not actionable *434 unless the plaintiff has suffered an injury over and\nabove the denial. See also Pilgrim v. Littlefield, 92 F.3d 413, 416 (6th Cir.1996). This is different from the\n\napproach taken by the courts to a claim that the plaintiff was denied a hearing in violation of the due process\nclause. Even if the hearing would not have resulted in any legal relief to the plaintiff, the improper denial of the\nhearing is an infringement of a right for which nominal damages can be awarded, and thus it is injury enough to\nsupport federal jurisdiction. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978); Buckley v.\nFitzsimmons, 20 F.3d 789, 796 (7th Cir.1994); Hessel v. O'Hearn, 977 F.2d 299, 302 (7th Cir.1992); Walters v.\nReno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1049 (9th Cir.1998). But in the case of a denial of access to the courts, the right infringed is\nso purely instrumental to the use of the courts to obtain legal relief00 so entirely lacking in intrinsic value00that if\n97 97\nthe denial has had no effect on the legal relief sought by the plaintiff, no right has been violated. Lewis v. Casey,\nsupra, 518 U.S. at 349-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174.\nDoes this mean that the plaintiff must prove that had it not been for his being denied access to the courts, he\nwould have won at least one court case? Or is it enough, as the plaintiffs here argue and the language of the \nLewis opinion suggests, id. at 353 and n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174; see also id. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, that the\nblockage prevented him from litigating a nonfrivolous case? It seems to us that the latter is the correct position,\nand this for three reasons, although only the first is applicable to all cases in which a denial of access to the\ncourts is alleged. This reason, mentioned in a footnote to the Lewis opinion, is that \"arguable claims are settled,\nbought, and sold.\" Id. at 353 n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2174. In other words, even if the claim, had it been pressed to\njudgment, would have failed, there is always a chance, provided the claim is not frivolous, that it would have been\nsettled before then. We can disregard the fact that even pure nuisance suits founded on completely frivolous\nclaims are sometimes settled on terms advantageous to the plaintiff. Fisher v. Kelly, 105 F.3d 350, 352-54 (7th\nCir.1997); Hooper v. Demco, Inc., 37 F.3d 287, 292 (7th Cir.1994). Frivolous claims do not engage the jurisdiction\nof the federal courts even if the claims have some value in the litigation marketplace. But we shall encounter\nshortly an example of the \"sale\" of a claim, not argued to be frivolous, by the two named plaintiffs in the present\ncase.\nThe second reason why a showing that the plaintiff had at least one nonfrivolous claim that he was blocked from\npursuing should be enough to establish standing to complain about the blockage is to avoid having to try a case\nwithin a case, that is, having to determine, purely in order to resolve the threshold issue of standing, how the\nplaintiff would have fared had his claim been litigated. Trials within trials are sometimes unavoidable, as in cases\nof legal malpractice, e.g., Mattson v. Schultz, 145 F.3d 937, 938 (7th Cir.1998); Winskunas v. Birnbaum, 23 F.3d\n1264, 1267-68 (7th Cir.1994), but they are to be avoided where possible.\nThird, in a case such as this in which injunctive relief is sought (as well as damages), it is not absolutely essential\nthat the plaintiffs be able to show that they have lost meritorious cases as a result of the blockage of which they\nare complaining. It is enough if they can show that they are highly likely to have a meritorious suit in the future\nthat they will not be able to litigate effectively because of the defendants' infringement of the constitutional right of\naccess. A probabilistic harm, if nontrivial, can support standing. Clinton v. City of New York, ___ U.S. ___, ___-\n___, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 2100-01, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998); Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 368, 100 S.Ct. 2232, 65\nL.Ed.2d 184 (1980); O'Shea v. Littleton, supra, 414 U.S. at 496-97, 94 S.Ct. 669; North Shore Gas Co. v. EPA,\n930 F.2d 1239, 1242 (7th Cir.1991); City of St. Louis v. Department of Transportation, 936 F.2d 1528, 1532 (8th\nCir. 1991). In the usual case, the possibility of some day having a nonmeritorious suit will be too speculative to\nsupport a present request for an injunction. But we can imagine a case in which the plaintiff's claim has accrued\n435 but he has not sued as yet (perhaps blocked by the prison's unconstitutional behavior) *435 and the statute of\nlimitations hasn't run.\nIt is not enough for standing, however, for the plaintiffs to be able to point to claims that they might have pressed\nto victory had it not been for the restrictions that the defendants placed on their access to the courts. They must\nalso show that their claims had been (or would be, if we are speaking of future claims) blocked by restrictions that\nviolate the Constitution. We thus are dealing with a class of cases in which the issue of standing and the merits of\nthe plaintiffs' claims are inseparable. See, e.g., City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U.S. 239,\n243 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983); Christopher v. Mobil Oil Corp., 950 F.2d 1209, 1222 (5th\nCir.1992). The broader the constitutional right of access is interpreted to be, the more likely it is that the plaintiffs\nwill lose cases because of its infringement; the narrower the right, the less likely its denial is to pinch. Suppose for\nexample that a refusal to supply inmates with lawyers to represent them in any nonfrivolous lawsuits they wanted\nto bring infringed the constitutional right of access. If so (it is not so, Lassiter v. Dept. of Social Services, 452 U.S.\n\n18, 25, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981); Zarnes v. Rhodes, 64 F.3d 285, 288 (7th Cir.1995); Farmer v.\nHaas, 990 F.2d 319, 323 (7th Cir.1993); Lavado v. Keohane, 992 F.2d 601, 605-06 (6th Cir.1993)), then since a\ncounseled inmate is more likely to win a suit than an uncounseled one, it would be apparent that the infringement\nwould injure any inmate who had a nonfrivolous legal claim. True, the injury would be only probabilistic. The\ninmate's legal claim might be so simple, or so overpoweringly meritorious, that he could easily prevail with no\nlegal assistance. But as the cases we cited earlier make clear, a probability of injury is enough to support\nstanding to sue unless the probability is slight.\nStanding and merits are intertwined in another way in this suit. If inmates who have nonfrivolous claims are\nunlikely to be impeded in pressing them to a successful conclusion by the acts or omissions alleged to deny their\nright of access to the courts, it is highly unlikely that those acts or omissions violate the right. See, e.g., Madrid v.\nGomez, 150 F.3d 1030, 1041 (9th Cir.1998); Norton v. Dimazana, 122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). It is a right of\naccess that is in question and if access is not blocked, the right is not infringed. And that is this case.\nMaximum security prisons are for the most dangerous prisoners. The segregation wards of these prisons are\ntherefore intended for the most dangerous of the most dangerous. It would not be feasible to give these prisoners\nthe run of the prison law library for hours on end. (Indeed it is customary to confine prisoners who are in\nsegregation in their cells for 23 hours of the day.) Instead the Illinois prison authorities use a system of\n\"runners\"00messengers who bring law books, complaint forms, and other legal materials to the prisoners who are\n97\nin segregation. These messengers are called \"inmate law clerks\" but their knowledge of law is rudimentary and\nanyway there are very few of them in proportion to the litigious inmate population. Many of the prisoners are\nfunctionally illiterate and so have great difficulty filling out complaint forms and other pleadings, reading judicial\norders and opinions, and responding to motions, without assistance, and they can get very little assistance from\nthe inmate law clerks. We may assume that this system is constitutionally inadequate, because the issue of\nconstitutionality has not been argued to us; but we emphasize that it is only an assumption. Pressed at argument,\nthe plaintiffs' counsel suggested that the Constitution requires every prison to hire a lawyer to train and supervise\nthe staff of inmate law clerks that serves the prisoners in the segregation wards. Such a requirement would go far\nbeyond the cases, which have declined to prescribe specific measures for compliance with the duty to assure\nprisoners' access to the courts. Bounds v. Smith, supra, 430 U.S. at 828, 830-32, 97 S.Ct. 1491; Madrid v.\nGomez, supra, 150 F.3d at 1041; Smith v. Shawnee Library System, 60 F.3d 317, 322-23 (7th Cir.1995). But the\nquestion before the house is only whether the two named plaintiffs, Walters and Ganci, have been or are likely to\n436 be impeded in their access to the courts. Suppose Walters and Ganci were *436 disbarred lawyers (they are not).\nThen in all likelihood the system we have sketched would not have disabled them from litigating nonfrivolous\nclaims, and then they could not maintain this suit, although a new suit could be filed by inmates who had been\ndisabled by the system.\nIn her most recent decision, Judge Bucklo meticulously analyzed the legal claims that Walters and Ganci have\nasserted or tried to assert over the long course of this litigation and concluded that what she had earlier found to\nbe the unconstitutional impediments to the use of the courts by inmates of the segregation wards had not\nimpeded these two inmates. Walters, although he scores very low on tests of reading ability (and why should he\nnot? What has he to gain from doing well on such tests?), has managed to file 13 suits (including the present\none), most of these being suits under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 complaining about the conditions of his confinement. He\nhas used complaint forms and other pleading forms that are provided to prisoners either by the prison or by the\ncourts for bringing such suits and he has received occasional assistance from inmate law clerks. Although most\nof his suits have been unsuccessful, in none involving a nonfrivolous claim (an important qualification) has he\nbeen tripped up by the inadequacies of the \"runner\" system. Again, the present case is a good\nexample00suggesting the paradox that ability to litigate a denial of access claim is evidence that the plaintiff has\n97\nno denial of access claim!\nTwo of Walters' suits were dismissed for want of prosecution after he failed to respond to inquiries from the court\nas to whether he wanted to continue with the suits after he had failed to respond to the defendants' motions to\ndismiss. There is no indication that these suits were colorable rather than frivolous; in one, for example, he\nmerely claimed that he wanted to see a doctor for a kidney problem00and without more, such a claim is frivolous\n97\nunder the Eighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Sellers\nv. Henman, 41 F.3d 1100, 1102 (7th Cir.1994); Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 702 (2d Cir.1998). And so it is\n\nimmaterial whether, as he contends, he didn't respond to the court's inquiries because he didn't know how to. In\nanother suit, this one joined by Ganci, Walters got a lawyer and, with the lawyer's assistance, won a $10,000\nsettlement. Presumably the suit was not frivolous; but as the plaintiffs had assistance of counsel, they can hardly\ncomplain of a denial of access to the courts.\nIn still another case, Walters had a lawyer who apparently persuaded him that the suit had no merit; it was\nvoluntarily dismissed; in any event a lawyer is more aid in litigating than a prisoner is entitled to. In another case,\nafter Walters' complaint was returned because he had filed it in the wrong federal district, he tried to file it in this\ncourt, and our clerk's office returned it to him with a letter advising him to seek the assistance of counsel. As it\nhappened, Walters was at the time represented by counsel in the present suit. In light of this circumstance, the\ndistrict judge disbelieved00as she was entitled to do, being the trier of fact00Walters' testimony that he did not\n97 97\nknow and could not discover the proper forum in which to file his complaint. Nor is there any indication that the\ncomplaint was nonfrivolous. It is pertinent to note that Ganci received assistance in filing one of his suits from a\nparalegal employed by his lawyers in this suit.\nThere is no need to discuss every suit filed by Walters or by Ganci, or Ganci's claims that he contends could\nhave made meritorious lawsuits had he had more legal assistance. In every instance, as explained by Judge\nBucklo, either the suit (or claim) has not been shown to have even arguable legal merit, or the plaintiff was not\nimpeded in litigating it by any arguably unconstitutional practice or omission. The plaintiffs have failed to show\nthat they would, to some reasonable probability, have fared better had the defendants taken the minimum steps00\n97\nwhich do not include the provision of counsel00that would be necessary to bring their practices into conformity\n97\nwith the requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the district judge. They have failed to show this even\nthough they have been ably represented in the district court and in this court.\n437 *437 It is true that lacking the aid or sophistication of a lawyer, the plaintiffs could not be expected to put their\nbest foot forward in those suits that they claim were unconstitutionally blocked or derailed short of victory; and the\ncases that were dismissed for want of prosecution or on other grounds might have been found by a lawyer to\nhave merit. But these points would bear on standing only if there were a constitutional right to counsel in civil\nsuits. The principle that the pleadings of pro se litigants are to be read liberally, McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S.\n106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993); Estelle v. Gamble, supra, 429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. 285; \nHaines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam), enables the legally\nunsophisticated plaintiff to get his foot in the courthouse door. If his pleadings reveal that a lawyer's assistance is\nnecessary to enable the plaintiff to litigate his suit, then the judge can request a lawyer to represent the plaintiff.\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e)(1); Mallard v. United States District Court, 490 U.S. 296, 301-02, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104\nL.Ed.2d 318 (1989); Forbes v. Edgar, 112 F.3d 262, 264 (7th Cir.1997); Parham v. Johnson, 126 F.3d 454, 456-57\n(3d Cir.1997). This system worked for Walters and Ganci, and so the present suit was properly dismissed for\nwant of standing, dooming the class action because they lacked standing when they filed the suit rather than\nlosing standing after the class was certified. This does not bar the filing of a new case if counsel can locate\ninmates of the segregation wards of Illinois' maximum security prisons who, unlike Walters and Ganci, have been\nprevented from effectively litigating nonfrivolous claims by the practices alleged to deny the constitutional right of\naccess to the courts. Since, however, the district court never acquired jurisdiction over the present suit, all\nprevious rulings in this litigation in the district court should be vacated, United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S.\n36, 39-41, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950); Harris v. Board of Governors, 938 F.2d 720, 723 (7th Cir.1991); \nIllinois v. City of Chicago, 137 F.3d 474, 478-79 (7th Cir.1998), in order to make absolutely clear that the earlier\nfindings of unconstitutional conditions, having been made in a case over which the federal courts never obtained\njurisdiction, can have no preclusive effect if a new lawsuit is filed.
