The prisoner sued the state of California under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, he claimed that the process by which an inmate is identified as a prison gang member or associate was unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment and lacked due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. He also claimed that the physical conditions of the Security Housing Units (SHU) and the psychological effects of long-term SHU confinement violated the Eighth Amendment. Finally, he challenged his own gang validation, claiming it was the result of retaliation by prison officials for his jailhouse lawyering.  </p><p>In 1996, the prisoner filed a second lawsuit in the Northern District of California against the California Department of Corrections, docket no. 3:96-cv-00682-MJJ. The documents in that lawsuit are not available to the Clearinghouse, so we don't know what the prisoner was challenging. He then moved to consolidate that lawsuit with this one, which had come first. On June 4, 1996, Judge Claudia Wilken granted the prisoner's motion to consolidate the two cases. </p><p>From 1995 to 2000, the parties litigated several motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment. On May 1, 2001, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, which was granted in part and denied in part by the District Court (Judge Martin L. Jenkins) on June 19, 2002. The District Court granted summary judgment as to the Eighth Amendment claim regarding the physical conditions of the SHU, and denied it as to the First Amendment overbreadth and retaliation claims and the Eighth Amendment claim regarding the psychological effects of SHU confinement.</p><p>On January 5, 2004, the District Court (Judge Jenkins) partially granted another motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, finding no due process violation except to the extent that the prisoner was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard during the course of his initial validation. Further, the Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the remaining Eighth Amendment claim, finding no unconstitutional psychological effects of prolonged SHU confinement. The District Court again denied summary judgment with regard to the First Amendment overbreadth and retaliation claims.   </p><p>The parties reached a settlement in 2004. The key result of the settlement was that a prisoner would not receive an indeterminate SHU term as a validated gang member or associate without first being found to be a current, active gang member or associate consistent with the procedural safeguards in the agreement, and that periodic reviews would be required to determine whether the prisoner remained an active gang member or associate.  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) agreed to propose to codify the policy changes agreed upon in the California Code of Regulations and/or the Department Operations Manual (DOM).</p><p>Specifically, the settlement provided that, with regard to due process in validations and inactive reviews, the defendants would provide notice and the opportunity to be heard to every prisoner. To this end, the defendants agreed to provide 24-hour notice to each prisoner of the items being considered as part of the determination and to provide a written record of the prisoner's opinion of these items. Further, prison officials would be required to record an \"articulable basis\" that prisoners were engaging in criminal or unlawful acts on behalf of a prison gang and could not rely on confidential informants unless the informants detailed the exact nature of the prisoner's involvement, without the use of hearsay evidence. The settlement also included a \"single source rule,\" where one gang-related incident could only count as one item of evidence even though it may be reported by multiple sources. Finally, the agreement provided that plaintiff's validation would be reviewed in accordance with the settlement. </p><p>After the settlement was filed with the District Court, the case was dismissed with prejudice on November 15, 2004.  The Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, however the plaintiff's counsel agreed to a set procedure for requesting future relief from the court. If the plaintiff's counsel believed that the defendants were not complying with the provisions of the settlement agreement to make policy changes, they would notify the defendants' counsel in writing, meet to discuss the issue, and only then could they ask the court for relief. This process would be unavailable once proposed changes to the policies described in the settlement agreement were internally finalized. No individual inmate can file for relief regarding an inmate's gang validation granted; individual inmate's concerns can only be raised by the plaintiff's counsel as examples of noncompliance. The defendants also agreed to pay $240,000 that would be divided up between the plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorneys as attorneys' fees and costs.   </p><p>In 2005, inmates began sending letters to the Court reporting violations of the settlement agreement. Inmates sent letters in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012, but the Court has not responded to any of these letters or investigated the allegations. </p>",

CASTILLO,  Case No. C-94-2847-MJJ-JCS \n1144   Plaintiff,  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n1155   v.   \n1166   EDWARD S. ALAMEIDA, JR., et al., \n1177   Defendants. \n1188    \n1199   Plaintiff STEVEN M. CASTILLO (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants EDWARD S. \n2200   ALAMEIDA, JR, et al.(“Defendants”) have agreed to resolve the claims alleged in the above-\n2211   captioned action on the terms set forth in this Settlement Agreement. \n2222   I.  INTRODUCTION \n2233   1.  This action was originally filed on August 9, 1994.  Plaintiff filed five \n2244   subsequent amended complaints.  Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the gang validation \n2255   procedures; the evidence used in his individual validation; and whether or not his validation was \n2266   the result of retaliation by prison officials for his jailhouse lawyering and peace proposal \n2277   activities.  Using the overbreadth doctrine that applies in the context of First Amendment \n2288   challenges to regulations, Plaintiff challenged not only his own validation, but also gang \n334499550000..11     --  11  --   SSEETTTTLLEEMMEENNTT  AAGGRREEEEMMEENNTT  \nCCIIVVIILL  NNOO..  CC--9944--22884477  MMJJJJ--JJCCSS  \n  \n  \n\n \n1  validation policies and procedures as applied to other prisoners. Plaintiff also challenged some of \n2  the physical conditions in the Segregated Housing Unit (“SHU”) at Pelican Bay State Prison \n3  (“PBSP”), as well as the psychological effects of long-term SHU confinement.   \n4  2.  The Defendants are Edward S. Alameida, Jr., Joseph L. McGrath, Jr., Alan \n5  Addison, Judy Olson, E.S. Rodriguez, Larry Williams, C. Sheppard, and J. Briddle, all of whom \n6  were sued in his or her official capacity.  Defendants deny any and all allegations raised by \n7  Plaintiff in this action.  \n8  3.  On June 19, 2002, the Court granted Defendants’ summary judgment \n9  motion as to Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim regarding physical conditions in the SHU.  \n10  Summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s First Amendment claims, retaliation claim, and Eighth \n11  Amendment claim (regarding the psychological effects of SHU confinement) were denied. \n12  4.  On January 5, 2004, this Court partially granted Defendants’ summary \n13  judgment motion finding there was no due process violation, except to the extent Mr. Castillo \n14  alleges he was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard during the course of his initial \n15  validation.  The Court also found that there was “some evidence” to support Mr. Castillo’s \n16  validation.  The Court granted Defendants’ summary judgment motion as to Plaintiff’s Eighth \n17  Amendment claim finding that there were no psychological effects of prolonged SHU \n18  confinement.   Summary judgment as to Mr. Castillo’s retaliation and First Amendment claims \n19  was denied. \n20  II.  PARTIES \n21  5.  The Plaintiff is Steve M. Castillo, a prisoner at Pelican Bay State Prison. \n22  6.  The Defendants are Edward S. Alameida, Jr., the former Director of the \n23  California Department of Corrections, Joseph L. McGrath, Jr., the Warden at PBSP, Alan \n24  Addison, a retired Senior Special Agent in the former Special Services Unit, Judy Olson, a retired \n25  Associate Government Program Analyst in the Law Enforcement and Investigations Unit, E.S. \n26  Rodriguez, a former CDC Lieutenant at PBSP, Larry Williams, a retired CDC Lieutenant at \n27  PBSP, C. Sheppard, a former Acting Warden at PBSP, and J. Briddle, a former CDC Lieutenant \n28  at PBSP.    \n349500.1   - 2 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  III.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES \n6  8.  For all policy and procedure changes described in this agreement, the \n7  Department of Corrections agrees to propose to codify the changes in either Title 15 of the \n8  California Code of Regulations and/or the Department Operations Manual (“DOM”).  The parties \n9  estimate it will take approximately 90 days from the date of the execution of the settlement \n10  agreement for the Law Enforcement Investigations Unit (“LEIU”) to finalize the proposed Title \n11  15 and/or DOM changes.  The proposed changes, whether to Title 15 or to the DOM, will then be \n12  forwarded to the Department of Corrections’ Regulation and Policy Management Branch, which \n13  may take approximately nine months to finalize the changes.  The Regulation and Policy \n14  Management Branch will assist in determining whether Title 15 and/or the DOM is the \n15  appropriate place to codify the policies and procedures recited herein.  The Department shall \n16  conclude its internal finalization of the proposed changes to both Title 15 and/or the DOM no \n17  later than one year from the date of the execution of this Agreement.   Plaintiff understands that \n18  following internal finalization of the proposed changes to Title 15 by the Department of \n19  Corrections, the Department of Corrections must forward the proposed changes to Title 15 to the \n20  California Office of Administrative Law and/or any other interested body for final codification.  \n21  A written copy  of any codification of these policies and procedures in either Title 15 or the DOM \n22  shall be provided to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 calendar days of their codification.   \n23  9.  Due Process in Validations and Inactive Reviews.  Defendants shall \n24  provide notice and opportunity to be heard to each and every prisoner at the pre-validation and \n25  inactive review stage.  Defendants agree to provide 24-hour advance notice to each prisoner of \n26  the source items considered prior to the validation packet being sent to Law Enforcement and \n27  Investigations Unit (“LEIU”) for approval or rejection of an initial validation.  Defendants also \n28  agree to record the prisoner’s opinion on each of the source items and to forward in written form \n349500.1   - 4 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  such opinions to LEIU.  A copy of the written record of the prisoner’s opinion shall be given to \n2  the prisoner, prior to the time the record is forwarded to LEIU.   \n3  10.  Defendants shall provide notice and opportunity to be heard for inactive \n4  reviews.  Notice shall be given to the prisoner at least 24 hours in advance of a consideration of \n5  inactive review.  Similarly, each prisoner shall be given an opportunity to record his opinions on \n6  the new source items as part of the inactive review.  The recorded views of the inmate shall be \n7  forwarded to the decision-makers over the inactive reviews prior to the rendering of a decision.  A \n8  copy of the written record of the prisoner’s opinions shall be given to the prisoner within fourteen \n9  calendar days of the inactive review.  Defendants agree that when new source items are raised, \n10  beyond those used in the initial validation, each inmate shall be given notice and opportunity to \n11  be heard during the inactive review. \n12  11.  The policies and procedures discussed in paragraphs 12 through 21 infra \n13  correspond  to the “independent source items” discussed in Title 15 § 3378(c)(8).   \n14  12.  Photographs.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(D)).   Defendants shall reasonably \n15  ascertain the date of any photograph used in any validation.  Defendants agree that no photograph \n16  used in any validation shall be older than six years.  Defendants agree that at the time the \n17  photograph is taken, at least one person in the photograph shall have been validated, or be \n18  validated no more than six months after the date the photograph was taken.  Defendants agree that \n19  staff shall record this information and provide it on a written form given to the inmate. \n20  13.  Talking in the Law Library.  (see Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(E)).   Defendants \n21  agree that a prisoner’s talking in a SHU law library to a validated gang member or associate shall \n22  not be relied upon as a source item unless IGI or staff has an articulable basis for determining that \n23  the communication was related to gang activity.  Defendants agree that staff shall record this \n24  information and provide it on a written form given to the inmate.  \n25  14.  Tattoos and symbols.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(B)).   Defendants agree that \n26  any tattoo or symbol relied upon as a source item must include an articulation by staff as to why \n27  the tattoo or symbol has a specific association with a particular prison gang.  Defendants agree \n28  that staff shall record this information and provide it on a written form given to the inmate.  \n349500.1   - 5 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  15.  Written Material/Communications.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(C) & (L)).   \n2  Staff must have an articulable basis for why a written material or communication is reliable \n3  evidence of gang association or membership.  Defendants agree that staff must articulate and \n4  record why a written material or communication is evidence of gang association/membership \n5  based on either the explicit, or coded, content of the communication.  With respect to greeting \n6  cards, such as a birthday card or get well card, staff must record an articulable basis for why the \n7  communication is evidence of gang membership or association. \n8  16.  Staff Information.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(E).)  Defendants agree that staff \n9  must have an articulable basis for determining that gang content or conduct at issue is gang-\n10  related.  Defendants agree that staff shall record this information and provide it on a written form \n11  given to the inmate. \n12  17.  Offenses.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(I)).   Defendants agree that if a \n13  disciplinary offense is considered a potential source item for validation, IGI or staff shall have an \n14  articulable basis for why the offense is gang-related.  Defendants agree that staff shall record this \n15  information and provide it on a written form given to the inmate. \n16  18.  Legal Documents.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(J)).   Defendants agree that staff \n17  shall have an articulable basis for why legal correspondence is a source item.  Staff shall \n18  articulate and record why a legal document is evidence of gang association or membership based \n19  on either the explicit or coded content of the document.   This information shall be recorded by \n20  staff and provided on a written form given to the inmate. \n21  19.  Address Books.  (see Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(L)).   Defendants agree that \n22  staff shall have an articulable basis for why the contents of address books are evidence of gang \n23  association.  This information shall be recorded by staff and provided on a written form given to \n24  the inmate. \n25  20.  Visitors.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(K)).   Defendants agree that staff must \n26  have an articulable basis for determining that the visitor and inmate discussed gang content or \n27  conduct.  Defendants must have an articulable basis for identifying the visitor as associated with \n28  the prison gang, and Defendants agree that the gang identification of a visitor may be rebutted via \n349500.1   - 6 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  a prisoner’s opportunity to present his views.  This information shall be recorded by staff and \n2  provided on a written form given to the inmate. \n3  21.  Confidential Sources.  (Title 15 § 3378(c)(8)(H)).   Defendants agree that \n4  “laundry lists” – that is, when confidential sources, including debriefers, identify a prisoner as an \n5  associate or member by listing names of inmate(s) without reference to gang-related acts \n6  performed by the inmate(s) – shall not be relied upon as a source item.  Defendants agree that the \n7  confidential source must identify specific gang activity or conduct performed by the alleged \n8  associate or member before such information can be considered as a source item.  This \n9  information shall be recorded by staff and provided on a written form given to the inmate. \n10  22.  Single Source Rule.  Defendants agree that a single, gang-related incident \n11  or conduct described or documented by multiple sources, confidential or otherwise, shall \n12  constitute one source item only.   \n13  23.  Hearsay.  Defendants also agree that exclusive reliance on hearsay from a \n14  confidential source will not be used as a source item for validation.   \n15  24.  Current, Active Determination.  Defendants agree that a prisoner will not \n16  receive an indeterminate SHU term as a validated gang member or associate without first being \n17  found to be a current, active gang member or associate consistent with the procedural safeguards \n18  established in this Agreement.  Each ICC and/or UCC review of an indeterminate SHU term will \n19  review the inmate’s current gang status and indicate that status on the 128G chrono.  The inmate \n20  will receive a copy of the chrono unless otherwise requested.  “Currently active” gang status is \n21  defined as any documented gang activity within the past six years consistent with CCR \n22  3341.5(c)(5).  Defendants agree that these requirements will be reflected in Title 15 and/or the \n23  DOM, to the extent they do not already appear there. \n24  25.  The provisions set forth in paragraphs 11 to 24 shall be applied on a \n25  prospective basis only, and shall apply throughout the Department of Corrections. \n26  26.  Training.  Defendants agree that the above policy changes shall be \n27  reflected in Institutional Gang Investigator (“IGI”)  training materials and gang educational \n28  materials considered and applied by LEIU, and shall be reflected in Title 15 and/or the \n349500.1   - 7 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  Department of Operations Manual.  Defendants agree that all relevant staff, including but not \n2  limited to IGI and LEIU, will receive training and instruction on the terms of the settlement \n3  agreement no later than 180 days after execution of the settlement where appropriate and as \n4  reflected in Paragraph 8. \n5  27.  Administrative Bulletin or Memorandum.  Defendants shall issue a \n6  memorandum or an administrative bulletin to notify general staff of the terms of the settlement \n7  agreement no later than 180 days after execution of the settlement.  A copy of the memorandum \n8  or administrative bulletin shall be provided to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 calendar days of its \n9  issuance.  \n10  28.  Gang Diversion Video.  Defendants will seek permission from the Director \n11  of the CDC to show a gang diversion video to the general and SHU populations.  A copy of the \n12  gang diversion video shall be provided to plaintiff’s counsel within thirty calendar days of its first \n13  broadcast, if any.  \n14  29.  Gang Validation of Plaintiff Castillo.  Defendants agree that after executing \n15  the settlement, Defendants will within 90 days review the validation of the Plaintiff in accordance \n16  with the modifications adopted pursuant to the settlement.  Defendants also agree that no source \n17  items learned of through Plaintiff’s deposition testimony in this litigation shall be considered \n18  against Mr. Castillo in any subsequent review of his gang validation. \n19  V.  ENFORCEMENT \n20  30.  The Court, specifically the Honorable Martin J. Jenkins, shall retain \n21  jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement.  The Court shall have the power to enforce \n22  the terms of this Agreement through specific performance and all other remedies permitted by \n23  law or equity. \n24  31.  While the parties agree that there is no ongoing monitoring of the \n25  Settlement Agreement,  \n26  (a)  If Plaintiff’s counsel believes that Defendants are not complying \n27  with the specific provisions of this Settlement Agreement to make policy changes, they shall \n28  notify Defendants’ counsel in writing via the U.S. Postal Service of the facts supporting their \n349500.1   - 8 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  belief.  Defendants shall investigate the allegations and respond in writing within 45 days.  If \n2  Plaintiff’s counsel are not satisfied with Defendants’ response, the parties shall meet and confer to \n3  resolve the issue(s).  If the parties are unable to resolve the issue(s) satisfactorily, Plaintiff may \n4  request relief in the U .S. District Court, Northern District of California, before Judge Martin J. \n5  Jenkins.  This process will cease to be available once the proposed changes to the policies \n6  described in this Settlement Agreement are internally finalized.  This occurs when the California \n7  Department of Corrections’ Regulatory and Policy Management Branch provides the proposed \n8  changes to the Office of Administrative Law and/or other interested bodies, where approvals are \n9  outside the California Department of Corrections’ control.   \n10  (b)  Following final codification of the proposed changes by the Office \n11  of Administrative Law and/or any other interested bodies, the California Department of \n12  Corrections will implement the codified changes.  For six months following the start date of the \n13  implementation of the codified policy changes, if Plaintiff’s counsel believes that Defendants are \n14  not complying with the implementation of the codified policy changes, they shall notify \n15  Defendants’ counsel in writing via the U.S. Postal Service of the facts supporting their belief.  \n16  Defendants shall investigate the allegations and respond in writing within 45 days.  If Plaintiff’s \n17  counsel are not satisfied with Defendants’ response, the parties shall meet and confer to resolve \n18  the issues(s).  If the parties are unable to resolve the issue(s) satisfactorily, Plaintiff may request \n19  relief in the U .S. District Court, Northern District of California, before Judge Martin J. Jenkins.  \n20  This process will cease to be available once the six-month time frame elapses from the \n21  implementation start date described above. \n22  (c)  There can be no individual inmate relief regarding an inmate’s gang \n23  validation granted through the above-described process; individual inmate concerns regarding \n24  his/her own gang validation can only be raised as exemplars by Plaintiff’s counsel of alleged \n25  noncompliance.  Individual inmate concerns must be raised through the California Department of \n26  Corrections inmate appeals process (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 15, §§ 3084 et seq.) and separate suit. \n27  VI.  ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS \n28  32.  Defendants shall pay Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP $240,000  \n349500.1   - 9 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  within 90 calendar days of the execution of this agreement.   That sum shall be divided among \n2  plaintiff’s counsel, future litigation efforts, and plaintiff as shall be decided by plaintiff’s counsel \n3  and plaintiff.  Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP shall complete a Payee Data Record \n4  form and shall return that Payee Data Record form to Defendants’ counsel upon execution of this \n5  agreement.   \n6  33.  At the time that Plaintiff and his counsel signs this settlement agreement, \n7  Plaintiff’s counsel shall also sign and return to counsel for Defendants an executed Stipulation \n8  and [Proposed] Order of Dismissal With Prejudice.  Plaintiff’s counsel authorizes counsel for \n9  Defendants to file the dismissal with prejudice with the court once the settlement check has been \n10  delivered to Plaintiff’s counsel. \n11  VII.  RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS \n12  34.  Plaintiff fully and forever releases and discharges all served and unserved \n13  Defendants, including Defendants Edward S. Alameida, Jr., Joseph L. McGrath, Jr., Alan \n14  Addison, Judy Olson, E.S. Rodriguez, Larry Williams, C. Sheppard, and J. Briddle, and all others \n15  who have ever been named as Defendants in this action, in both their individual and official \n16  capacities, from all claims, demands, actions, and causes of action including claims for attorneys’ \n17  fees, court costs, and other costs of suit, arising out of an alleged injury or claims incurred by \n18  Plaintiff as alleged in this action.  Plaintiff also fully and forever releases and discharges the State \n19  of California, the California Department of Corrections and its employees, agents (including, but \n20  not limited to the Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California and its employees and \n21  agents), servants, and other representatives, past or present, from all claims, demands, actions, \n22  and causes of action, including claims for attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other costs of suit, \n23  arising out of any alleged injury or claims incurred by Plaintiff as alleged in this action.  Plaintiff \n24  specifically, but without limitation, releases the Releasees for all claims that were brought or that \n25  could have been brought.  Plaintiff does not release any claims regarding the review of his \n26  validation as set forth in paragraph 29 of this Agreement nor any claims regarding  any future \n27  inactive reviews of  his status on behalf of the Classification Committee.   \n28  35.  Plaintiff acknowledges and agrees that this release and discharge is a \n349500.1   - 10 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  general release.  Plaintiff expressly waives and assumes the risk of any and all claims identified in \n2  Paragraph 7(h) which exist as of this date, but which he does not know or suspect to exist, \n3  whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence, or otherwise, and which, if known, \n4  would materially affect his decision to enter into this settlement agreement.  Plaintiffs has read \n5  the contents of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, and he expressly waives \n6  the benefits of this section.  Section 1542 reads as follows: \n7  Section 1542.  (General Release - Claims Extinguished) \nA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does \n8  not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the \nrelease, which if known by him must have materially affected his \n9  settlement with the debtor. \n10  Plaintiff assumes the risk that the facts or law may be other than he believes. \n11  36.  Upon the execution of the settlement agreement, Defendants shall be \n12  deemed to and shall have released Plaintiff Castillo from any and all claims relating to the \n13  original Complaint and the Second Amended Complaint, Third Amended Complaint, Fourth \n14  Amended Complaint, and Fifth Amended Complaint. \n15  VIII.  PARTIES’ AUTHORITY \n16  37.  The signatories hereby represent that they are fully authorized to enter into \n17  this agreement and bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions hereof. \n18  38.  All of the Parties acknowledge that they have been represented by \n19  competent, experienced counsel throughout all negotiations which preceded execution of this \n20  agreement, and this agreement is made with the consent and advice of counsel. \n21  IX.  MUTUAL FULL COOPERATION \n22  39.  The Parties agree to use their best efforts and to fully cooperate with each \n23  other to accomplish the terms of this agreement, including but not limited to, execution of such \n24  documents and to take such other action as may reasonably be necessary to implement and \n25  effectuate the terms of this agreement.  \n26  X.  MODIFICATION \n27  40.  This agreement may not be changed, altered, or modified, except in writing \n28  and signed by the parties hereto, and approved by the Court.   \n349500.1   - 11 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO. C-94-2847 MJJ-JCS \n \n \n\n \n1  XI.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT \n2  41.  This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties \n3  concerning the subject matter hereof.  No extrinsic oral or written representations or terms shall \n4  modify, vary or contradict the terms of this agreement.  In the event of any conflict between this \n5  agreement and any other settlement-related document, the parties intend that this agreement shall \n6  be controlling. \n7  XII.  CHOICE OF LAW/JURISDICTION \n8  42.  This agreement shall be subject to, governed by, construed, enforced, and \n9  administered in accordance with the laws of the State of California, both in its procedural and \n10  substantive aspects, and shall be subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the United States District \n11  Court for the Northern District of California.  According to Magistrate Judge Edward M. Chen at \n12  the May 28, 2004 Settlement Conference, “[u]nder the terms of the settlement agreement, the \n13  District Court will retain jurisdiction to supervise the enforcement, should that be necessary.”  \n14  This agreement shall be construed as a whole according to its fair meaning and intent, and not \n15  strictly for or against any party, regardless of who drafted or who was principally responsible for \n16  drafting this agreement or any specific term or condition thereof. \n17  XIII.  COUNTERPARTS \n18  43.  This agreement may be executed in counterparts, and when each party has \n19  signed and delivered at least one such counterpart, each counterpart shall be deemed an original, \n20  and, when taken together with other signed counterparts, shall constitute one agreement, which \n21  shall be binding upon and effective as to all Parties. \n \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n349500.1   - 12 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nCIVIL NO.
