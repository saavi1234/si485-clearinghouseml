The first step in addressing these concerns will be to obtain some statistical data and other background information which will enable the court to gauge, at least preliminarily, the likely dimensions of the problems. The court described to counsel the information it desires. DCFS will provide a report containing this information by December 5, and a further status conference to discuss the information will be held at 10:00 a.m. on 12/09/03.

Grady: Status conference held to discuss the concerns raised by Patrick Murphy, the Public Guardian, in his recent letters to the court. Class Counsel and counsel for DCFS agreed with the court that there are four principal areas of concern: (1) unsatisfactory case workers; (2) unsatisfactory private agencies; (3) insufficient numbers of qualified persons willing and able to accept placements; and (4) inadequate services, especially mental health services, provided to children who are placed. The first step in addressing these concerns will be to obtain some statistical data and other background information which will enable the court to gauge, at least preliminarily, the likely dimensions of the problems. The court described to counsel the information it desires. DCFS will provide a report containing this information by December 5, and a further status conference to discuss the information will be held at 10:00 a.m. on 12/09/03. Notices mailed by judge's staff notice (cdy) (Entered: 11/05/2003)"

    "summary": "<p>The ACLU filed this class action lawsuit in 1988 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the state of Illinois, on behalf of all children in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) placed somewhere other than with their parents. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Adoption Assistance Welfare Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 620-28, 670-76. </p><p>The class consisted of all children who had been or would be in the custody of DCFS, and children who had been or would be placed somewhere other than with their parents. The ACLU, the Office of the Public Guardian, and private counsel represented the class. The plaintiffs asked the court to grant injunctive relief, alleging that the policies and practices of DCFS violated substantive due process, equal protection, and procedural due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, violated provisions of the AAA, and violated state statutory provisions. More specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that DCFS policies and practices had resulted in mental and physical damage to the plaintiffs, because DCFS failed to place them in safe, stable homes in a suitable time and manner. </p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that while children were in DCFS custody (because of abuse or neglect by their custodians), DCFS failed to provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, health care, protection from harm, and education to the children. The various homes, shelters, and institutions in which the children were housed did not offer adequate educational opportunities, and the behavior of the children was controlled by physical discipline. Placement in these institutions caused damage to the physical and emotional well being of the children. In one DCFS shelter an eight year-old girl was raped by two twelve year-old boys. DCFS caseworkers were assigned too many cases to allow them to competently perform their duties and as a result did not follow-up on the cases that they were assigned. Children faked suicide attempts and slit their wrists to get the attention of the DCFS worker in charge of their case. DCFS failed to provide funding and services that were essential to the care of children in its custody. Additionally, DCFS failed to ensure that necessary services to reunite families were in place. </p><p>The court declined to dismiss the case. B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387 (N.D. Ill. 1989).</p><p>The parties entered a consent decree in 1991, under which DCFS promised to hire additional employees to investigate child abuse and check on children in state custody. At the request of both sides, the Court appointed a Monitor to oversee the process and provide reports on the defendant's progress towards implementing the provisions of the decree.  </p><p>The Office of the Public Guardian, which acted as guardian ad litem for many children in DCFS custody, sought to intervene. The District Court (Judge John Francis Grady) repeatedly denied the motions to intervene. On January 14, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit (Judge Richard Dickson Cudahy) affirmed the District Court's decision. B.H. v. Murphy, 984 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 960 (1993).</p><p>In 1994, the Monitor filed a report with the Court stating that DCFS had complied with less than half of the 93 reforms stipulated in the consent decree. Press coverage of the Monitor's reports, public interest in the court-held status conferences, and attention from gubernatorial campaigns created an adversarial stalemate between the parties. As a result, the District Court held that the public did not have a right of access to status conferences between the parties. B.H. v. Ryder, 856 F. Supp. 1285 (N.D. Ill. 1994).</p><p>The parties then agreed to new strategies to implement the goals of the consent decree. A research center at the University of Illinois replaced the court monitor in providing regular reports on the defendant's progress. Additionally, the parties identified strategies to address the most serious non-compliance issues. The parties filed a Restated Consent Decree reflecting these modifications in 1997.</p><p>By July 2001, DCFS achieved substantial compliance with the original consent decree. Because of plaintiffs' on-going concerns about inadequate case workers and services, though, the parties negotiated a joint modification of the consent decree, approved by the Court in February 2003. </p><p>Defendants continued to struggle with addressing children's educational outcomes and access to mental health services as of a September 2005 court-held status conference. The Illinois legislature had proposed cuts in funding for DCFS in 2009, but the Court ordered the defendants to continue complying with the consent decree regardless of funding cuts.</p><p>Plaintiffs complained in 2012 to DCFS that its investigator caseloads were still substantially out of compliance with the consent decree. The parties negotiated an implementation plan in August 2012 to address the compliance issue regarding investigation caseloads, signed into effect on August 14, 2012. </p><p>Litigation resumed in February 2015 when plaintiffs alleged that DCFS was again failing to meet the requirements of the consent decree. The parties then nominated experts for the Court to approve in investigating how DCFS can improve its services and placements to the plaintiffs. On October 20, 2015, following the Court-ordered experts' report, Judge Alonso approved the recommendations. On September 28, 2016, Judge Alonso ordered the execution of an ongoing communication plan between DCFS and the experts and entered the Amended and Revised DCFS Implementation Plan incorporating the experts' recommendations and the new communication plan. </p><p>According to the early expert reports, DCFS made significant improvements at first, but later reports indicated that these improvements subsequently slowed and the defendant failed to comply with information requests. On December 7, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the provision to limit the investigator's workload in the decree, alleging that the number of cases per caseworker was far exceeding the standard in the amended decree. Judge Alonso denied this motion on September 20, 2018.   </p><p>In a further attempt to force the defendant to comply, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the decree and require DCFS to address the safety concerns of youth hospitalized in Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. On November 21, 2018, Judge Alonso partly granted the motion and ordered injunctive relief. </p><p>Throughout much of 2018, the parties litigated over the defendant's alleged failure to share information according to the consent decree. The plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the relevant part of the decree on February 7, 2018. Although this motion was denied on June 8, 2018, 2018 WL 3022676, the parties later came to an agreement on information sharing. Judge Alonso appointed a special master on January 10, 2019. The parties came to an additional agreement regarding placement of youth in DCFS custody on May 24, 2019. </p><p>As of May 2020, the monitoring is still ongoing.</p>",

In December 2018, the court appointed a special master to mediate further disagreements on the amended decree and implementation plan. ",

The reporting period \nfor the Second Triannual Report addresses the time period generally from February through \nMarch 2017.1 As the Court likely is aware, Director Sheldon has announced his resignation \neffective June 15, 2017.2  Despite this change, the Implementation Plan is a binding court order \nand is not directly impacted by the appointment of a new DCFS director.  DCFS has assured the \nExpert  Panel  and  the  Plaintiffs  of  its  commitment  to  the  programs  and  initiatives  it  has \nundertaken through the Implementation plan.   \nWhile some progress toward DCFS’s reform goals has been made since February, 2017, \nPlaintiffs and the Experts have  significant concerns about the next phase of work required under \nthe  Implementation  Plan.    The  Plaintiffs  and  the  Expert  Panel  have  provided  separate \nsubmissions to the Court outlining those concerns.   \n \nDetailed Status Report \nThe following provides the detailed report regarding the various initiatives that DCFS has \nundertaken pursuant to the Implementation Plan. \n                                                 \n1The deadline for filing the First Triannual Status Report to the Court was extended, and it \naccordingly covered the period of approximately September 2016 through February 2017.  The \nparties and the Expert Panel agreed that, the second report would cover a shorter time frame and \nwould be filed now so that future reports would be back “on track” to cover a true “triannual” \nperiod.  It is anticipated that the third triannual report to the Court will cover information for the \nperiod April 1 through July 31, 2017. \n \n2 DCFS General Counsel Lise T. Spacapan has been named the Interim Director while a \nnationwide search for a new Director is conducted.  DCFS Associate Deputy Director Pete \nDigre, who has been instrumental in the actual execution of Implementation Plan also remains at \nDCFS.    \n1 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 5 of 88 PageID #:2061\n \nI.  Application of Implementation Science to the Implementation Plan: \nUtilize principles of Implementation Science to develop, implement, evaluate and modify \ninitiatives outlined in the B.H. Implementation Plan. \n1.  Project Goals / Target: This Court’s Order of July 11, 2016 [Dkt. 527] provides \nfor DCFS’s retention of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN), to review and \ncomment on DCFS’s adherence to best practices in implementation science and assist with an \nassessment of DCFS’s implementation capacity and strategy.  \n2.  Status Report:  There was significant delay in finalizing the contract with Dr. \nMetz.  The contract was executed effective February 14, 2017 and DCFS provided logic models \nto Dr. Metz regarding the projects in the Implementation Plan on or about February 10, 2017.   \nDr. Metz provided a virtual presentation to DCFS on April 5, 2017, regarding Supporting \nSustainable Implementation of Research Evidence in Child Welfare.  Exhibit A, PowerPoint by \nMetz for Child Welfare Association.  Dr. Metz has emphasized that for a system like Illinois, in \nwhich the vast majority of services are provided through private providers, it is important to \nwork closely with those providers in developing and then co-implementing the type of practice \nmodel change that DCFS has committed to undertake.  Given the present stage of DCFS’s \nimplementation efforts, Dr. Metz stated that a significantly more intensive effort to involve POS \nproviders is needed. \n3.  Revised  Targets  /  Goals:    DCFS,  the  Expert  Panel  and  the  Plaintiffs  are \nattempting to schedule an in-person meeting with Dr. Metz to further discuss implementation \nscience and teaming issues with respect to the B.H. Implementation Plan. During the next \nreporting period, DCFS will develop a set of strategies with Dr. Metz to improve implementation \nof the initiatives in the Implementation Plan and a timeline for execution of those strategies.  \n2 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 6 of 88 PageID #:2062\n \nII.  Overarching Outcome Measures \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan requires DCFS to measure \nsafety, permanency and well-being of class members and to monitor changes in both the quality \nand quantity of services and supports to class members and their families.   The metrics DCFS \nwill use for measuring safety and permanency are the same measures used in the national Child \nand Family Service Reviews (CFSR), and the measures for well-being are based on a matrix \ndeveloped by the Child Welfare Advisory Sub-Committee.  Implementation Plan, pp. 4-7.   \n2.  Status Report:  \nValidation of Safety, Permanency and Stability Measures.  DCFS originally set June \n2017 as its anticipated date to complete full validation of the safety, permanency, and stability \nmeasures.  Validation  is  ongoing  for  the  exiting  dashboards  for  the  safety,  stability  and \npermanency measures and DCFS staff continue to finalize the validation of the overarching \nmeasures to meet the revised July 2017 deadline. \nIntegration of CANS DATA.  In the last Report, DCFS stated its intent to begin tracking \nas many well-being measures as possible.  At present, DCFS is in the process of consolidating \nthe CANS application, which will allow better tracking of CANS data on child wellbeing.   \nDCFS also set the deadline for integrating CANS data relative to the well-being measures \ninto the SACWIS system in the first quarter of FY18 (i.e., July through September 2017).  DCFS \nis currently working with DCFS executive leadership to develop a plan to prioritize the work for \nintegrating the CANS data.    \nIM CANS.  DCFS was to decide whether to implement the Illinois Medicaid (IM) CANS \nbefore the current reporting period.  DCFS has decided to proceed with that implementation.  \nDCFS DoIT/OITS staff have engaged with stakeholders regarding implementation of the IM \n3 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 7 of 88 PageID #:2063\n \nCANS and are currently identifying short term and longer range plans to consolidate CANS \nprocesses on one application.  Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects.  \nPrioritization for Mindshare.  By April 30, 2017, DCFS, working with the Expert Panel \nand Plaintiffs, was to develop a prioritization of the different B.H. projects for completion and \nincorporation into Mindshare and a timeline by program stating when the data for the program \nand associated dashboards will be up and running on Mindshare.  The Expert Panel had planned \nto discuss the prioritization of Mindshare dashboards with the parties at its April 5 – 6, 2017 \nmeeting, but there was not time available at the April 2017 meeting.  DCFS has not yet provided \na  plan  for  review  or  consideration  by  the  Experts  or  Plaintiffs,  but  is  working  on  the \nprioritization of the dashboards in the Mindshare platform and will develop the prioritization \nduring the next reporting period. \nIn the interim, DCFS has continued to develop dashboards in the Mindshare platform. \nDashboards went live for several B.H. related projects, including the IB3 waiver and Family \nFinding.  Other dashboards, including SAFE Families and Regenerations, remain in various \nstages of development. Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report IT Projects.  \nValidation of CANS Data.   DCFS agreed to validate information from the CANS using \na variety of other data in the CWAC wellbeing matrix.   A work plan has been developed to \nimplement the validation work, which is currently scheduled to begin in July 2017 and end in \nDecember 2017.  Key steps in the validation process include:   \nACTIVITY  RESPONSIBLE  DESCRIPTION  TARGET DATES \nTraining in New  IA/ Erikson  Statewide Training in  May 8-9, 2017 \nMeasures  the DECA   \nUtilization –New  IA  IA incorporates the  Start: July 5, 2017 \nMeasures  measures into \nassessment process \nData  OITS/ Objective  Build a database to enter  Approval: May 1, 2017 \nManagement  Arts/ NU  new measures for  Completion: June 15, 2017 \n4 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 8 of 88 PageID #:2064\n \nanalysis of well-being  Use: July 1, 2017 \ndata \nData Analysis:   JPA/ NU  Includes the CANS,  Plan Complete: June 15, \nand all measures that  2017 \nwill be in use/ can be  Data Analysis: 1st& 3rd \naccessed  for FY ‘18  Quarters of FY ‘18 \nInitial Findings: 3rd Quarter \nof FY ‘18 \nCANs-Full Use  IA/ Harms/ NU  Immersion Sites will  Pre-work: May 1, 2017 \nTarget -200  receive enhanced  Start: June 1, 2017 \nImmersion Site  implementation support  Completion: Dec. 2017 \nCasework Staff  for the optimal use of \nthe CANS in practice- \nrequires 3-months \n \nExhibit C, Immersion Site Four Month Status Update.  \nISBE  Data  Integration  into  SACWIS:  In  the  last  report,  DCFS  noted  that \nrepresentatives from the OITS, Legal Services, and Operations were meeting in Springfield on \nFebruary 14, 2017, to identify barriers in obtaining the ISBE data and developing a plan to obtain \nthe needed data. That meeting was held and it was determined that the barrier to this initiative is \ndetermining how education data can be added to SACWIS without requiring manual matching of \nISBE records with the DCFS records.  Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects.  \nExpansion  of  Access  to  the  Mindshare  Website  Within  DCFS.  Immersion  Site \nDirectors and project managers already have access to the Mindshare Website.  Training for \nadditional DCFS staff is underway as the Mindshare dashboards are developed.  To date, the \nproject managers are being trained as the dashboards for their projects are being developed. \nPrivate Provider Access to Mindshare.  DCFS previously reported that a security \nprotocol  must  be  developed  to  allow  outside  providers  to  access  the  Mindshare  website.  \nFacilitating such access will be critically important under the practice model that DCFS is \npreparing to implement in the Immersion Sites.  However, DCFS is currently reviewing and \nexploring how this security protocol will be developed and then implemented.   \n5 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 9 of 88 PageID #:2065\n \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nValidation  of  Safety,  Permanency  and  Stability  Measures.    DCFS  continues  to \nanticipate that the safety, permanency, and stability measures to be fully validated by July 2017.   \nIntegration of CANS Data.  Consolidation of the CANS application was anticipated to \nbe  completed  by  September,  2017.    The  anticipated  deadline  to  integrate  CANS  data  into \nSACWIS (during the first quarter of FY 2018) is no longer realistic.  By the next reporting \nperiod, DCFS will have developed a plan identifying the steps needed for the integration to occur \nand  a  timeline  for  completion  of  those  steps.    The  adjusted  anticipated  deadline  for  the \nintegration is the fourth quarter of FY 2018; however, meeting that deadline assumes that DCFS \nis able to secure necessary IT support, either internally or through contracting.   \nWith  respect  to  development  of  the  wellbeing  matrix,  DCFS  and  outside  providers \n(OITS/  Objective  Arts/  Northwestern  University)  obtained  final  approval  of  the  plan  for \ndevelopment of a database to enter the new measures for analysis of the wellbeing data on or \nabout May 1, 2017.  It is anticipated that the new database will be completed by June 15, 2017 \nand operational by July 1, 2017.  The Juvenile Protective Association and Northwestern will \ncomplete a data analysis of the wellbeing data by June 15, 2017 and the initial findings will be \nissued by the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2018. \nIM CANS.  The IM CANS will be implemented by March 2018.   \nPrioritization for Mindshare.  The Implementation Plan states the following: “While \ninternal  positions  are  being  established  and  filled,  there  will  be  some  transitional  activity \nincluding a contract with MindShare and with Eckerd. MindShare will collaborate with the \nDivision of Quality Assurance, the Division of Strategic Planning and Innovation, and the \nIllinois Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT).   Contracts began in September 2015 \n6 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 10 of 88 PageID #:2066\n \nand will be in place until January 2018 to assist with the transition and to provide additional \nassistance.”   Amended and Revised B.H. Implementation Plan, [Dkt. 531] p. 50.  The contract \nwith Mindshare began in September 2015 and is in place through January 2018.  At the present \ntime, DCFS is exploring the possibility of developing a replacement for the Mindshare platform \nusing POWERBI and MS SQL server engines in house.  DCFS recently hired a Victor O. \nJohnathan, MBA, PMP as its Chief Information Officer, who will be involved in the exploration \nof the development of the possible replacement for the Mindshare platform. DCFS anticipates \nthat a decision regarding the Mindshare platform will be made within the next reporting period \nand that a transition plan will be developed once that decision is made.  Plaintiffs are concerned \nabout the viability of DCFS’s plan to replace Mindshare by January, 2018, as set forth in their \nseparate submission.    \n  ISBE Data Integration into SACWIS.  DCFS anticipates that student records from \nISBE will be available in SACWIS during the next reporting period.  The ISBE records will be \ninput into SACWIS.  The next step will be for DCFS to work to develop aggregate reports from \nthe individual records.  Aggregate reports will be used for data analysis.     \nExpansion of Access to Mindshare Website within DCFS.  This has been completed. \nPrivate Provider Access to Mindshare.  DCFS is still evaluating whether security \nconcerns can be addressed.  Decisions regarding whether access can be given will be made \nduring the next reporting period.   \nIII.  Implementation of Specific Recommendations of the Expert Panel \nA.  Panel Recommendation #1: \nInstitute a children’s system of care demonstration program that permits POS agencies \nand DCFS sub-regions to waive selected policy and funding restrictions on a trial basis in order \n7 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 11 of 88 PageID #:2067\n \nto reduce the use of residential treatment and help children and youth succeed in living in the \nleast restrictive, most family-like setting.  (Implementation Plan, pp. 7-25).  \nThe Implementation Plan identifies four initiatives DCFS is pursuing in response to \nRecommendation # 1.  The first is the Therapeutic Foster Care Pilot initiative.  The second is the \nCase Management Entity pilot.  The remaining two are programs targeted to the needs of “dually \ninvolved youth” – the Regenerations pilot and Pay for Success.  Each of these programs is \ndiscussed individually below. \nB.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots \n1.  Project  Goals  /  Target:  The  Implementation  Plan  calls  for  DCFS  to  select \nprivate  agencies  to  implement  evidence-based  or  evidence-informed  therapeutic  foster  care \nprograms over the next five years.  The goal of the TFC pilot is to determine whether outcomes \nfor youth served in the TFC pilot programs are equal to or better than those for youth who meet \nthe  clinical  criteria  for  residential  treatment  and  are  placed  in  residential  treatment.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 8-13.  At least 60% of the youth served in TFC licensed homes are to \nbe age 12 and older.  Implementation Plan, pp. 8-9.   \nDCFS set a two-year goal for the recruitment and licensure of therapeutic foster parents \nand placements.  The original goal included placement of a minimum of 40 children and youth in \nlicensed  TFC  homes  at  the  end  of  the  “first  contractual  year”  (meaning  April  2018)  and \nplacement of a minimum of 100 children and youth at the end of the “second contractual year” \n(meaning April 2019). \n2.  Status Report:  \nDevelopment and Service Contracts. Two agencies participating in the pilot asked \nDCFS to extend the initial development contracts due to recruitment and model implementation \nchallenges, which postponed the delivery of services for several months.  The development \n8 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 12 of 88 PageID #:2068\n \ncontract  with  LSSI  was  extended  on  February  3,  2017  and  the  development  contract  with \nCHAID was extended on January 20, 2017.  The development contracts for both LSSI and \nCHAID were extended to June 30, 2017.  DCFS has twice provided JCFS with the extension on \nthe development contact, but the contract has not yet been provided to DCFS.  Service contracts \nfor FY17 are in place for all providers in this pilot. \nThe third agency that originally was participating in the pilot – Children’s Home & Aid \n(“CHAID”) has chosen to refocus its work and is developing an alternative relative care model \nthat  focuses  on  strengthening  and  training  relatives  in  crisis  intervention  and  de-escalation \ntechniques to care for challenging youth.  Given CHAID’s current approach, CHAID is no \nlonger a part of the pilot as such, but DCFS will work with and continue to monitor CHAID’s \nprogram in conjunction with the TFC pilot. Exhibit D, Four Month Status Report, Therapeutic \nFoster Care. \nDCFS has added Youth Outreach Services (YOS) as an official participant in the pilot \nthrough a contract executed on March 1, 2017.  YOS intends to provide therapeutic foster home \nplacements under the Therapeutic Foster Care Oregon Model (TFCO), which LSSI is also using.  \nExhibit D, Four Month Status Report, Therapeutic Foster Care.  Exhibit D, Four Month Status \nReport, Therapeutic Foster Care. \nTFC Placements.  DCFS revised its timeline for serving youth through the TFC pilot.  \nThe revised timeline called for placing a minimum of 40 children and youth in licensed TFC \nhomes by April 1, 2018 and to have a minimum of 100 children and youth placed in TFC homes \nby April 1, 2019, with at least 60% of the youth served in the age group of 12 and older. \nAs of May 1, 2017, two youth (ages 10 and 12) have been placed through LSSI’s \nprogram, one 15-year-old has been placed through JCFS’ program, and one 16 year-old has been \n9 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 13 of 88 PageID #:2069\n \nplaced through YOS.  No youth have been placed with CHAID due to modifications made to the \nmodel they are currently implementing.  \nTFC Foster Parent Recruitment.  LSSI trained a total of 20 families in the Therapeutic \nFoster Care Oregon Model during the month of February.  After the training, LSSI ruled out four \nfamilies as not being appropriate for the model. LSSI has identified 10 families/ homes that are \nprojected to be licensed, trained, and certified in the TFCO model by April 30, 2017. LSSI \ncurrently has 25 families in the pipeline for licensure.  Exhibit D, Four Month Status Report \nTherapeutic Foster Care Pilot.  Families must be trained, licensed, and certified under TFCO to \naccept youth.  At present, a total of 12 LSSI homes are available for placement and five homes \nalready have youth placed in the homes.  \nJCFS continues to have two homes in the licensure/certification process.  At present, a \ntotal of one JCFS home is available for placement or is already serving a child. \nYOS has one home that is in the process of renewing its license and one foster home that \nis in the process of becoming licensed. Both homes must be certified and trained, which is \nprojected to be completed by the next  reporting period.  At present, YOS has a total of two \nhomes available for placement or are already serving a child. \nTFC Referrals and Eligibility.  During March 2017, four youth were referred to the \nYOS program.  Of the four youth, YOS has accepted two youth in their program as of April \n2017.    Exhibit D, Four Month Status Report, Therapeutic Foster Care. Those two youths were \nplaced in the homes in May 2017; one youth was placed on May 10, 2017 and the other youth \nwas placed on May 25, 2017.   \nDCFS is attempting to address several issues with the referral process for the TFC pilot.  \nOriginally, the pilot limited eligible youth based on how they scored on the Child and Adolescent \n10 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 14 of 88 PageID #:2070\n \nIntensity Instrument (CASII).  First Triannual Interim Status Report on the B.H. Implementation \nPlan (corrected) [Dkt. 538], p. 19.  A CASII is required for each youth being considered for the \nTFC pilot and is completed either during a CIPP staffing or by request to the DCFS Clinical \nDivision.  A youth is eligible for the TFC pilot if they score a 5 on the CASII.   \nLSSI has had difficulty identifying youth six to 14 years of age in the correct legal county \nwith the necessary score on the CASII for the LSSI program.  To address this challenge, DCFS \nhas partnered with the TRPMI pilot to identify such youth, as the TRPMI pilot also requires \nadministration of CASII to determine a level of care.   To date, however, none of the youth in the \nTRPMI pilot meet the age or county criteria for the available LSSI homes. Exhibit D, Four \nMonth Status Report, Therapeutic Foster Care.   \nIn addition, as of April 2017, eligibility for the TFC pilot has been expanded to include \nyouth in residential treatment facilities with the requisite score of a five on the CASII.  LSSI will \ntarget youth between six and 14 years of age who have been in residential treatment for 30 to 60 \ndays for completion of a CASII.  The DCFS Central Matching Unit, along with the TFC pilot \nmanager, has requested additional resources from the DCFS Clinical Division to complete the \nCASIIs.  This assistance will be provided on an ongoing basis.  \nThe TFC Project Manager also has been working with the DCFS Central Matching Unit \nto identify youth who are targeted to move from one residential facility to another, youth in \npsychiatric hospitals and youth who are identified through the current CIPP and other staffing \nprocesses to increase the pool of referrals.   Exhibit D, Four Month Status Report, Therapeutic \nFoster Care.  These youth also will be eligible for the TFC pilot if they have the requisite CASII \nscore. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 15 of 88 PageID #:2071\n \nThe TFC Steering Committee considered, but rejected, changing the eligibility criteria for \nthe pilot to a lower CASII score.3 \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nExpansion and Service Contracts.  Service contracts for the agencies participating in \nthe TFC pilot are in place through Fiscal Year 2017 and are in process of being distributed and \nexecuted  for Fiscal Year 2018.  The Expert Panel is concerned about the current contract \nnegotiations and rate setting process underway for this service, which have delayed finalizing \ncontracts and reimbursing agencies for their contract expenses.  The TFC contract development \nand approval process reflects what the Expert Panel has observed as a pervasive Departmental \nproblem executing timely contracts that secure, maintain, and individualize needed services for \nfamilies and children with challenging emotional and behavioral needs.   \nTFC Placements.  The revised placement goals and timeline for the TFC pilot remains \nas stated in the prior Report to the Court -- a minimum of 40 children and youth in licensed TFC \nhomes by April 1, 2018 and to have placement of a minimum of 100 children and youth by April \n1, 2019, with at least 60% of the youth served in the age group of 12 and older.  JCFS expects to \nhave ten youth served and eight homes licensed and certified by September 30, 2017; YOS \nexpects to have four youth and six homes licensed and certified  by September 30, 2017; and \nLSSI expects to have 26 youth served and 30 homes licensed and certified  by September 30, \n2017.   \nTFC  Foster  Parent  Recruitment.  By  the  next  reporting  period,  DCFS  will  have \nrequested and obtained foster parent recruitment plans from all participating agencies.  DCFS \n                                                 \n3This change would have impacted the current evaluation plan since a revision of the comparison \ngroup would be required.   \n12 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 16 of 88 PageID #:2072\n \nwill continue to monitor closely the progress of the three agencies to recruit and certify TFC \nfoster homes to meet these revised deadlines. \nTFC  Referrals  and  Eligibility.  DCFS  will  continue  to  monitor  the  referral  and \neligibility process to ensure timeliness in the decision and placement process.  The current \nreferral and eligibility process for TFC provides that a youth will be identified either through the \nCIPP process, the DCFS Central Matching team, or on  occasion, from the DCFS Clinical \nDivision after a staffing.  Once the youth has been found eligible for the TFC pilot, information \nis requested from the potential agencies for consideration. The agencies have five to seven days \nto make a determination if they can then accept the youth and provide an appropriate placement.  \nDCFS has worked diligently to streamline this process from two weeks to the five to seven day \nwindow and continues to monitor this process for other necessary adjustments.  \nThe DCFS Project Manager receives monthly recruitment efforts from each agency in \norder to monitor the mechanism for recruitment of potential foster parents/ families.  \nC.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Care Management Entity \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe planned goals for the Care Management Entity (CME) pilot include:  increasing non-\ntraditional,  community-based  behavioral  health  supports;  faster  step-downs  for  youth  in \ncongregate care settings (i.e., 15% of enrolled youth to step down six months after enrollment \nand another 15% to step down 12 months after enrollment); treating youth and family voice and \nchoice  as  primary  factors  in  permanency  planning  and  mental  health/behavioral  health \ninterventions; reduction in youth experiencing elevations in level of care (i.e., youth being placed \nin  specialized  foster  care  or  congregate  care  settings);  increased  placement  stability  at  the \ntraditional foster care level (i.e., fewer lateral moves); high service-intensity youth receiving \n13 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 17 of 88 PageID #:2073\n \nnecessary  behavioral  health  supports  and  services  in  their  home  and  community  settings; \ndecreased psychiatric hospitalization; and increased permanency.   \nThe CME pilot, which is administered though CHOICES, began in February 2014 and \nwas scheduled to continue through June 30, 2017.  The goal of the pilot was to serve 200 youth \nannually and 600 youth during the course of the pilot.  DCFS committed to identifying a \ncomparison group for the evaluation by December 2016 and to completing an interim evaluation \nby March 2017.  Implementation Plan, p. 19.  \n2.  Status Report:   \nExtension of the Pilot in FY18:  Assuming that a managed care program is implemented \nfor the children in DCFS’ care beginning as of FY 2019, the Choices program will be replaced \nand/or essentially mooted by that managed care program.  DCFS accordingly has determined that \nthe CME model should remain in pilot status during Fiscal Year 2018.  DCFS and pilot staff \nwere to develop a plan for continuing service provision (e.g., contract renewals, new contracts) \nto youth in the pilot upon the conclusion of the pilot period.  The original plan contemplated \ndeveloping targets and timeframes to accomplish the transition from a pilot project to an ongoing \ncare management model. This will not be completed since the decision was made to keep the \nChoices program in pilot status for Fiscal Year 2018 pending the anticipated move to a statewide \nManaged Care Organization program for youth in care beginning in FY 2019.   \nDCFS is in the process of revising the program plan with Choices to address issues \nregarding  aftercare  services,  disenrollment  (discharge)  expectations  and  outcome  data.4  \nAdditional changes will include the requirement for aftercare services and maintaining youth in \n                                                 \n4 For example, under the current revised program plan, youth who transition to a transitional \nliving plan or independent living arrangement will no longer be considered “successful \ndisenrollments,” and instead will remain enrolled in the CME pilot for at least nine months post-\nplacement to ensure stability.   \n14 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 18 of 88 PageID #:2074\n \nthe CME until permanency is achieved and DCFS is no longer the legal guardian of the youth.  \nAdditional  revisions  may  also  be  required.      Exhibit  E,  Four  Month  Status  Report,  Care \nManagement Entity Pilot Update. \nChildren Served.  The initial plan for the CME estimated an average census of 200 \nyouth in care throughout the pilot.  That target was not met.  The CME pilot had served 350 \nyouth in care through March 31, 2017.  As of April 28, 2017, 157 youth in care were being \nserved in the CME pilot.  Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, Care Management Entity Pilot \nUpdate April 2017.   It is anticipated that a monthly census of approximately 160 youth will be \nserved through the CME pilot during FY 2018.  \nIn the pilot, the percent of children stepped down from congregate care within six months \nof enrollment was 1% (1 youth), compared to an expected 15%, and an additional 7% (5 youth) \nstepped down within seven to twelve months, compared to an expected 15%.  Altogether, 8% of \nenrolled youth stepped down from congregate care, compared with an expected 30% within the \nidentified timeframes.   \nBetween January and April 2017, there was a reduction in the rate of hospitalization for \nchildren who received mobile crisis response services (from three youth hospitalized in January, \n2017 to two in February, 2017, and none in March, 2017).  Finally, during the latest reporting \nperiod, 15% of enrolled youth remained in a stable living arrangement (e.g. pre-adoptive home, \nfoster  home,  home  of  relative  or  home  of  fictive  kin)  for  at  least 12  months  or  achieved \npermanency within 12 months of enrollment in the CME pilot, compared to the goal of 80%.   \nAddressing Program Barriers.  DCFS previously committed to improving support for \nthe CME pilot during this reporting period and to addressing service gaps and deficiencies in the \npilot.  Thereafter, DCFS was to track the extent to which its actions with DCFS regional staff, \n15 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 19 of 88 PageID #:2075\n \ncommunity stakeholders and providers had a positive outcome on the services provided to youth \nin the pilot and the outcomes they achieve. \nMeetings involving DCFS, POS, and CME were conducted on February 24, 2017, April \n29, 2017, and May 30, 2017.  In addition, the DCFS Project Manager and Project Supervisor for \nthe CME pilot held teleconferences with CME administration on March 30, 2017, April 11, 2017 \nand April 14, 2017.  The meetings and discussions focused on identification of service gaps, \ndecision-making in Child and Family Team Meetings, and performance expectations.  Exhibit E, \nFour Month Status Report, Care Management Entity Pilot Update April 2017.    \nDCFS  has  identified  Lynda  Petrick,  Agency  Performance  Team  Supervisor,  as  a \nchampion of the CME pilot.  Her role will be to facilitate communication between POS agencies, \nDCFS and Choices staff as well as to immediately address performance issues that may arise \nwithin POS partner agencies.  Deborah Keen, DCFS Behavioral Health Specialist, has also been \nconnected to the CME pilot.  Her role will be to assist with frontline case issues that arise in the \nCME/child welfare partnership and to identify and address barriers to service implementation. \nIn addition, DCFS and CME Administration met and agreed to focus on placement \ndevelopment and resolution of non-consensus issues. While the meeting did not result in specific \nservices for the CME to develop, they were told to establish relationships with community \npartners who could be called upon to develop a service tailored to a child’s needs. For example, \nthere  are  universities  and  mental  health  centers  accessible  within  the  four-county  area. \nConnections with social work, psychology, and education departments could yield a group of \npotential providers of services for families. In addition, the CME was instructed to link with their \nlocal child welfare partners to assess what these partners viewed as priority services for children \non their caseloads. They are to build services around these recommendations. This is being \n16 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 20 of 88 PageID #:2076\n \nmonitored through the monthly Choices-Child Welfare meetings and case discussions.  The \nplacement development issue revolved around what Choices could do, as a non-licensing agency, \nto help recruit foster parents with both DCFS and POS agencies.  By the time of the meeting \nbetween DCFS and CME Administration, Choices already had met with the CYFS foster parent \nrecruitment group (which includes current and prospective foster parents).  At that meeting, \nChoices was able to provide information on how the Choices program could offer supports for \nyouth and foster parents in the home environment. Choices is scheduling similar meetings with \nother private agencies, such as Children’s Home + Aid and LSSI.  Additionally, the DCFS \nProject Manager and Project Supervisor informed Choices that a broader community stakeholder \ngroup, including groups such as CASA, educational providers, community businesses and law \nenforcement, also needed to be developed.  Choices agreed to prioritize the development of the \ncommunity stakeholder group in FY 2018. \nTo address the placement resource and development issue, the CME pilot will collaborate \nwith the TRPMI pilot.  DCFS identified 14 youth in the CME pilot who have been placed in \nresidential treatment facilities for more than 12 months and who overlap both the CME and \nTRPMI pilots.  These youths will be prioritized by the CME for appropriate placements.  At least \nthree youth have been staffed under this collaboration. \nThese staffings were not CFTMs, but were clinical reviews that involved residential \ntreatment facility administration, the child welfare supervisor or program administrator, and the \nChoices Care Coordination supervisor / Clinical Director.  The three youth were identified due to \nnon-consensus  within  the  CFTM  regarding  step-down  from  a  residential  treatment  facility. \nFollowing the clinical reviews, which included administrative representation from the provider \nmembers, the recommendations and tasks to transition from congregate care were communicated \n17 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 21 of 88 PageID #:2077\n \nback to the Child and Family Teams meetings.  CFTMs were convened for each youth on April \n11,  20-17,  April  18,  2017  and  April  25,  2017.    Before  concise  transition  plans  could  be \nidentified, the CFTMs were advised to address the most pressing barriers first such as, reluctance \nof adoptive parents to have youth return home, logistical challenges to aiding a parenting teen \nwho has children placed far from her, and specific supports to improve transitioning a youth to a \ngrandparent with minimal resources. The Choices Project Supervisor and Deanne Muehlbauer \n(from the University of Illinois Chicago) will be scheduling follow-up to the original clinical \nreviews to review the cases and determine progress with the listed action items.   \nMoving forward, TRPMI staff will provide additional support to the CME by completing \nclinical reviews on youths who experience issues surrounding clinical preparedness for discharge \nor lack of placement resources. Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, Care Management Entity \nPilot Update.   \nOn the issue of “non-consensus,” DCFS is implementing changes to address situations \nwhere a permanency worker does not agree with the decisions made at the CFTM (e.g., decisions \nto step a youth down, or not step a youth up to a higher level of placement).  Such situations \nwere resulting in delay.  Going forward, in situations with disagreement, a CME/child welfare \nsupervisory conference and a final decision by the Clinical Administrator will be completed \nwithin ten work days.  Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, Care Management Entity Pilot \nUpdate.  \nFoster Parent Recruitment and Improved Communication.  DCFS committed to \nimplementing  improved  communication  to  foster  parents  regarding  the  services  available \nthrough the CME. Pilot staff were to develop a plan with specific targets and timeframes to \nincrease the number of new and existing foster homes in the pilot project area prepared to and \n18 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 22 of 88 PageID #:2078\n \ncapable of providing step-down placements for youth with more challenging needs.    To do so, \nChoices met with the foster parent group at one private agency and scheduled meetings with \nother foster parent groups from other agencies.  At these meetings, Choices will explain the \nadditional supports it can provide to youth and to foster parents as a youth is stepped down from \nresidential care.   \nCourt Outreach.  DCFS promised to undertake additional outreach with the judge in \nVermillion County to provide an overview on the CME pilot, to solicit feedback from the judge \nand other stakeholders, and to identify supports for serving youth from Vermillion County in \ncommunity-based settings. That occurred on April 4, 2017.  Judge DeArmond provided positive \nfeedback regarding performance of the CME pilot and child welfare staff. He was pleased with \nthe performance of Choices staff and the supports they provided while working with child \nwelfare staff and families.  Judge DeArmond did not identify any corrective action items.  He \ndid, however, inquire about supports and services for parents with developmental disabilities and \nhow those supports and services could be used to help impacted families.   \nEnhancement to the Mobile Crisis Response Process:  The service of a mobile crisis \nresponse team to assess youth undergoing a behavioral health crisis has been offered through the \nCME Pilot since April 2016.  Data continues to demonstrate that this service deflects youth from \npsychiatric hospitalization. Exhibit F, January 2017 Data, February 2017 Data and March 2017 \nData.  In March 2017, 17 DCFS youth were screened for psychiatric hospitalization.  Eleven of \nthose youth were not enrolled in Choices and six were enrolled in Choices.  All of the Choices \nyouth were able to be deflected from a hospitalization.   \nTo enhance this service, beginning in April 2017, youth and families who receive mobile \ncrisis response services will also receive in-home supports within 12 hours or crisis screening to \n19 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 23 of 88 PageID #:2079\n \nhelp prevent re-escalation and the need for additional crisis screenings.  Exhibit E, Four Month \nStatus Report, Care Management Entity Pilot Update.  \nPilot Evaluation. The target date for evaluation of the program through Fiscal Year 2017 \nhas been delayed to September 2017. \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nExtension of the Pilot. During the March and April 2017 teleconferences, DCFS advised \nChoices Administration that the program would remain in pilot status during FY 2018.  A review \nof the program plan in April 2017 led to the clarification of expectations regarding permanency \nand the work that was expected to be completed by the CME, such as remaining involved with a \nfamily until legal permanency was achieved and not discharging a family when they appeared \nstable.  These requirements regarding permanency are being incorporated into the program plan \nfor FY 2018. \nChildren Served. The goal for FY 2018 is for Choices to maintain a monthly census of \n160 children. \nAddressing  Program  Barriers.    The  CME  will  hold  a  child  welfare  stakeholders’ \nmeeting at least once a month, where DCFS, private agency and CME administrations can \ndiscuss current challenges and work collectively to address those challenges. The first of these \nmeetings  occurred  on  February  24,  2017.    In  April  2017,  DCFS  determined  that  monthly \nmeetings would occur and the DCFS Project Manager and DCFS Project Supervisor are the point \npersons for meeting organization, documentation and reporting outcomes.  The DCFS Project \nManager is currently discussing the monthly meeting protocol with participating stakeholders.  \nDCFS will also be working with the CME pilot to ensure the CME provides data regarding \n20 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 24 of 88 PageID #:2080\n \nchildren  enrolled  in  the  Choices  pilot  that  is  more  consistent  with  the  DCFS  overarching \noutcome measures such as permanency and placement stability.  \nFor placement resource and development, the collaborative process has already begun.5  \nThe DCFS Project Supervisor will continue to identify youth for collaboration with the TRPMI \npilot. By July 1, 2017 the DCFS Project Supervisor and Behavioral Health Specialist Deborah \nKeen will schedule staffings for identified youth, create plans for involving the CFTM in the \ndecision-making process, and develop action steps.   \nThe CME Administration will be responsible for arranging and/or developing the needed \nservices and supports for each youth. The Choices Provider Relations Team is responsible for \ndeveloping resources and DCFS regularly monitors the Choices provider network.  For youth in \nresidential treatment facilities enrolled in Choices, the Choices Provider Relations Team must \nwork to develop the appropriate resource for the step-down placement.  DCFS monitors this on a \nmonthly basis through Choices reports to the DCFS Project Supervisor.  Behavioral Health \nSpecialist Deborah Keen will also serve as a real time prompt to complete assigned development \ntasks for each youth. \nTransition  to  Managed  Care  Program.  The  DCFS  Project  Manager  is  convening \ninternal DCFS meetings to discuss the child welfare role clarification during partnership with a \nmanaged care organization.  An initial meeting was held in May 2017 to present the idea of \npreparing for the larger change to a statewide MCO.  At the initial meeting, the idea was \npresented to develop archetypes of children and families served by DCFS and private agencies so \n                                                 \n5The initial steps occurred in March 2017, when the DCFS Project Supervisor identified three \nyouth enrolled in Choices placed in residential treatment facilities that were also part of the \nTRPMI pilot.  The three youth were given clinical reviews and the action steps in those reviews \nare being reviewed. Another youth who was newly referred to Choices and is placed in a \nresidential treatment facility that is closing will have a TRPMI review in June 2017 to assist with \nstep-down planning.   \n21 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 25 of 88 PageID #:2081\n \nthere is clarity regarding what children and families really look like, the paths cases may take, \nand where the managed care overlay becomes apparent.  \nAs additional meetings are scheduled, the Project Manager will include the Expert Panel, \nplaintiffs’ counsel and other DCFS division representatives.  General topics for discussion at \nthose meetings will include decision-making for services to meet the unique needs of child-\nwelfare involved families, communication between the MCO and the child welfare staff and the \nmanner in which conflicts will be resolved.   \nDCFS acknowledges that all work for children and families must be centered within the \nChild and Family Team and be family-driven.  The lessons learned from the Choices pilot \ninclude the fact that the child welfare staff and MCO need to both know and acknowledge who \nwill do what for a family and that the decisions need to be driven by the family.  Other lessons \nlearned include the need for consolidation of activities, guidelines for payment of services, and \ncollaboration.  These areas will also be the topics of ongoing discussions as the MCO process \ncontinues to roll out. \nFoster  Parent  Recruitment  and Improved Communication.  The Choices  role  for \nfoster parent recruitment is for Choices to “sell” the program supports it can offer to current and \nprospective foster parents.  Choices has committed to attending similar meetings with other \nprivate agencies.  Choices has also been instructed by DCFS project management staff to create \nadditional opportunities to reach out to potential foster parents. \nCourt  Outreach.    DCFS  staff  will  schedule  meetings  with  court  personnel  from \nChampaign, Ford and Iroquois counties involved in the CME pilot.  DCFS project management \nstaff will work with DCFS legal staff to schedule meetings with courts in Champaign, Ford, and \nIroquois counties during the next reporting period.   \n22 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 26 of 88 PageID #:2082\n \nEnhancement  to  Mobile  Crisis  Response.  The  enhancement  to  the  Mobile  Crisis \nResponse was initiated in April 2017.  The enhancement included the addition of the 12-hour \npost deflection response by the Choices clinical staff to provide support to the youth and the \nfoster parent.  To evaluate this enhancement, those families who receive the post-deflection \nresponse will be tracked to determine if they experience a reduction in subsequent crisis calls and \nfewer hospitalizations.   \nPilot Evaluation.  Mark Arber is the identified researcher from the University of Illinois, \nUrbana-Champaign and he has been provided with guidelines for the comparative research as \nwell as access to the child care information.  One challenge to be addressed in the next reporting \nperiod is the acquisition of information on youth in comparison counties and the plan to address \nthat will be developed in the next reporting period.  \nD.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved \nYouth at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe Regenerations pilot is designed to provide placements and intensive services to \nDCFS youth in care who are also involved in the juvenile justice system and are ready for release \nfrom the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).  Implementation Plan, pp. 20-22.  The \nprogram provides traditional mental health services, care coordination, foster care services (if \nneeded)  and  individualized  home  and  community  based  services  through  a  wraparound \nphilosophy.  Id. The program goal was to serve 65 youth.  There was no deadline specified in the \nImplementation Plan for reaching that level of service, however the pilot was scheduled to be \ncompleted in June 2017 (See report page 32).   Implementation Plan, p. 21.   The Regenerations \npilot is a collaborative effort with the JTDC, Cook County Juvenile Probation, Lutheran Child \nand Family Services (LCFS), Youth Advocate Programs (YAP), and the University of Illinois at \n23 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 27 of 88 PageID #:2083\n \nChicago (UIC).  See Exhibit G, Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved Youth at Cook \nCounty Juvenile Detention Center Four Month Status Report, April 28, 2017; Exhibit H, DCFS \nRegenerations RUR/Pilot Logic Model 4-28-2017.   \n2.  Status Report:    \nProgram Conversion.  Beginning in February 2017, DCFS was to implement specific \nstrategies to ensure that the service data and the billing data for youth served through the pilot \nproject are reconciled. The billing and service data has not been reconciled. DCFS is still in the \nprocess of addressing this matter by reviewing specific cases that have billing discrepancies.  \nThe Regenerations pilot was to be moved from a pilot project to an ongoing DCFS program upon \ncompletion of the pilot in June 2017. That process has been started and will require contract \nadjustments with LCFS and YAP.   \nFoster Parent Recruitment.  LCFS had provided DCFS with a plan for expansion of the \nfoster parent resources necessary for the program. First Triannual Interim Status Report to the \nCourt on the B.H. Implementation Plan, Exhibit O, LCFS Foster Parent Recruitment Plan.  That \nplan, which places increased emphasis on fictive kin and enhanced family finding strategies, has \nbeen reviewed and is being revised based on feedback provided at the April 2017 monthly \nRegenerations Implementation Team meeting. \nProgram Refinement. Within the last reporting period, LCFS and YAP have refined \ntheir case management and advocacy approach within the pilot.  LCFS hired a Wraparound \nconsultant  in  April  2017.    The  consultant  was  retained  to  develop  a  wraparound  model \ncustomized to the Regenerations pilot.  YAP hired an additional program director and three \nadditional advocates. There has been an increase in the frequency in communication among \n24 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 28 of 88 PageID #:2084\n \nLCFS,  YAP,  and  DCFS,  which  has  resulted  in  improved  consensus  building  and  problem \nsolving.6 \nIn the last reporting period, there were indications that post-placementchild and family \n \nteam meetings (CFTM) are not being conducted as frequently as expected. The goal was to \naverage 0.35 CFTMs per month.  During the last reporting period, the CFTM data came in well \nbelow the goal, peaking at .08 CFTMs per month. The consensus during implementation team \nmeetings was that reports of CFTMs that were facilitated may have been taking place but were \nnot entered into SACWIS in a timely manner. Given that Chapin Hall utilizes the post-placement \nCFTMs to evaluate the fidelity of the wraparound philosophy, this was an important issue to \nremedy. To address this through continuous quality improvement, Chapin Hall has produced \nweekly  data  reports  that  are  presented  at  monthly  implementation  meetings  to  review  the \nreporting for certain evaluation outputs (e.g., CFTMs, Advocate Hours, Parent/Child/Sibling \nvisits) compiled from SACWIS or SharePoint databases. Providers review these changes to \ntroubleshoot circumstances where this data was not entered (e.g., child on run, in detention, in \nresidential treatment). This review provides the opportunity for providers to maintain compliance \nwith their program staff to be more diligent in entering data within SACWIS and SharePoint in a \ntimely and accurate manner. \n                                                 \n6 This has assisted the agencies in quickly responding to issues.  A recent case example \nhighlights why response without delay is significant.  An 18-year-old female Regenerations \nclient, who is the parent of an infant child, went to a police station to report an attempted \nabduction.  While at the police station, the police held the 18-year-old client on an alleged \nviolation of probation and her infant child was subsequently taken into temporary custody.  \nImmediate intervention by LCFS and YAP lead to the release of the youth and to reunification \nwith her infant within a number of hours.  Both the youth and her child were then placed with a \nfoster family.  This immediate response prevented the youth from being involved in the criminal \njustice system. \n25 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 29 of 88 PageID #:2085\n \nRecently, there has also been an increase in residential placements of youth pursuant to \ncourt  orders.    Exhibit  G,  Four  Month  Status  Report,  Regenerations    This  impacted  the \nRegeneration pilot’s ability to place youth in community-based settings with relatives or foster \nparents.   This may limit the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the intensive advocate \nsupport and wraparound services provided through the Regenerations pilot  since many of the \nwraparound set of services that are utilized as part of the Regenerations pilot cannot be provided \nto youth placed in residential care and there may not be a sufficient number of youth placed in \nsettings other than residential care who meet the criteria for the pilot to evaluate the effectiveness \nof the services provided through Regenerations. \nProgram Data.  During this reporting period, DCFS implemented specific strategies to \nensure the accurate and reliable submission and tracking of service data for youth assigned to the \nRegenerations pilot.   All providers now use a coordinated protocol for staff that ensures timely \ndata submission to SharePoint and SACWIS databases.  In addition, in April 2017, DCFS and \nthe Cook County Juvenile Court entered a data sharing agreement.  The Cook County Juvenile \nCourt will provide historical data to DCFS and Chapin Hall on youth similar to the youth in the \nRegenerations pilot in order to formulate a baseline and comparison group. This data will \nconsiderably  contribute  to  the  assessment  of  whether  or  not  the  pilot  project  is  effective. \nCurrently, Chapin Hall provides data reports at the monthly Regenerations Implementation Team \nmeetings.    This  allows  real-time  feedback  to  the  Implementation  Team  regarding  process \nmeasures associated with the fidelity of the pilot’s service model. \nDashboard.    DCFS  has  identified  specific  data  outputs  and  outcomes  for  reports \nregarding the Regenerations pilot and finalized the data collection methods for this information.  \nDCFS  has  identified  three  key  metrics,  based  on  the  input  of  the  B.H.  Expert  Panel,  and \n26 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 30 of 88 PageID #:2086\n \nidentified an additional nine metrics. All the metrics are contained in Table 1 to the Four Month \nStatus Report.  Regenerations data were to be incorporated into the Mindshare platform by the \ndate of this Report, and DCFS anticipated that it would begin tracking outcomes for the children \nwho have been served to date, with a particular focus on stability and safety. \nProgram Evaluation.  DCFS anticipates that Chapin Hall will perform the comparative \ndata analysis needed to evaluate the pilot by October 2017.  Exhibit G, Four Month Status \nReport, Regenerations Pilot.  \nAdditional  Contracts.    In  the  last  reporting  period,  DCFS  was  in  the  process  of \ndeveloping contracts for other agencies to provide similar services to dually involved youth:  \nYouth Outreach Services, National Youth Advocate Program, Youth Advocate Program and \nChildserve.  Those contracts have been executed.  It was anticipated that these agencies would \nbegin providing services by the date of this Report.  Service delivery has begun.    \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nProgram Conversion.  For FY 2018, YAP will contract with DCFS directly as an \nindependent  contractor.    YAP  will  continue  to  provide  intensive  advocate  support  for \nRegenerations clients, but will also expand to service other youth in care outside of the pilot.   \nYAP’s intensive advocacy support is needed for all dually involved youth, not just youth being \nreleased from detention. YAP will be available to Childserve, NYAP and YOS as needed.  In \naddition, DCFS caseworkers or dually involved specialists will be able to refer dually involved \nyouth to a YAP advocate with the approval of the Statewide Dually Involved Administrator.  \nYAP has hired additional staff to handle an increase in the number of youth served within the \nnext fiscal year.  Exhibit G, Four Month Status Report, Regenerations Pilot Project. \n27 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 31 of 88 PageID #:2087\n \nLCFS  NYAP,  YOS,  and  YAP  will  contract  with  DCFS  directly  as  an  independent \ncontractor for FY 2018.  \nFoster  Parent  Recruitment.  Only  LCFS  and  YOS  have  submitted  foster  home \nrecruitment plans.  LCFS has submitted a draft recruitment plan in June 2017 and the plan \nprojects 20 new homes by the conclusion of FY 2018.  LCFS began recruiting in June 2017.  \nYOS submitted a foster parent recruitment proposal in May 2017, which is under review.  If it is \napproved and adopted, YOS projects to have 10 TFC homes by the conclusion of FY 2018.   \nProgram  Refinement.    The  Wraparound  consultant  retained  by  LCFS  will  provide \nrecommendations by June 30, 2017, and the Project Manager will implement recommended \nprotocols/processes within two weeks thereafter.  DCFS will monitor this progress through \nregular meetings and data reviews.   \nTo address the failure to submit timely and accurate data for program data metrics such \nas CFTMs, Chapin Hall will continue to produce weekly data reports that are presented at \nmonthly implementation meetings to provide the opportunity for providers to ensure compliance \nwith their program staff to be more diligent in entering data within SACWIS and SharePoint. To \naddress the problems arising from the increase in residential placements of youth pursuant to \ncourt orders, DCFS and Regenerations are developing enhanced coaching and supervision for \ncase managers to better prepare them for court hearings.   \nThe enhanced training will be developed by August 2017, and coaching for all case \nmanagers and advocates who are a part of the Regenerations pilot will take place by September \n2017.    During  the  monthly  dually  involved  stakeholders  meeting  with  Judge  Toomin,  the \npresiding judge over delinquency court, the Statewide Dually Involved Administrator and Project \nManager  will  provide  updates  on  the  Regenerations  pilot  and  will  communicate  DCFS’s \n28 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 32 of 88 PageID #:2088\n \nconcerns regarding residential placement orders and the impact on service delivery.  The goal of \nthis  process  is  to  increase  confidence  amongst  the  judiciary  in  the  Regeneration  pilot  to \nencourage  supportive  judicial  decisions.  DCFS  will  also  host  a  collaborative  learning  and \nintegration meeting in August 2017 with the other service providers assisting with the RUR and \ndually involved population.  The objective of the meeting will be to share lessons learned thus \nfar from Regenerations, provide technical assistance to the additional service providers, and set \nexpectations for FY 2018.  \nImprovement  of  Data  Management.  The  next  major  data  goal  will  be  to  utilize \nhistorical data from the JDTC to develop a comparison group.  Chapin Hall evaluators will use \nthe historical data related to youth in care detained and released from the JDTC to compare to the \nreported metrics within the pilot.  Chapin Hall is currently determining what metrics can provide \na side by side comparison given the data collected from JDTC.  A comparison data sample will \nbe available by October 2017.   \nDashboard.  The date for development of the Regenerations dashboard in Mindshare is \nnot yet determined, but it is anticipated that this dashboard will be in the development phase by \nOctober 2017 either with the assistance of Mindshare, the assistance of other outside consultants \nor a platform developed internally by DCFS .   \nAdditional Contracts. Beginning on July 1, 2017, three additional service providers \n(YOS, NYAP and YAP) will serve dually-involved youth who are RUR at the JDTC or dually \ninvolved.  These providers will not become part of the Regenerations pilot, and instead will \nsupplement the pilot.  Although LCFS and YAP are the main parts of the Regenerations pilot, \nthere are limitations to placement resources that are needed from other agencies.  The additional \nagencies are expected to develop between nine and 14 more specialized/dually involved foster \n29 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 33 of 88 PageID #:2089\n \nhome beds within the next six months. DCFS’s goal is to develop a broader range of expertise \nand resources to youth in and out of the pilot. \nE.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved \nYouth \n1.  Progress Goals / Target:   \nThe Illinois Pay for Success Pilot is designed to reduce recidivism and to increase \nplacement stability, educational achievements and employment opportunities for youth dually \ninvolved in the child welfare and juvenile justice system.  Implementation Plan, pp. 22-25.  The \npilot was to be funded through a social impact bond, by which private funds are used to pay for \nthe pilot services.  DCFS would not have an obligation to pay for services delivered through the \npilot unless it is clearly demonstrated that the services had a statistically significant impact on the \noutcomes of the youth enrolled in the program.  Implementation Plan, pp. 22-23.   \n2.  Status Report:   \nFunding.  CCN completed a fundraising period that set a goal of raising $17 million by \nMarch 31, 2017.  Because that goal was not met, CCN extended the deadline for its fundraising \ngoal to July 31, 2017.  The funds are intended to cover the projected cost of the pilot for four \nyears of treatment (through September 2021) and three years of evaluation.   \nYouth Served.  There are 25 youth currently receiving services as part of the pilot.  CCN \nhas capped enrollment at no more than 25 youth in Cook, Lake, Franklin and Jefferson counties \nthrough the completion of the current fundraising period.   \nProgram Refinement.  DCFS previously identified two issues with the program that had \nto be addressed:  1) communication issues and referral pathways for caseworkers to partner with \na Wrap Facilitator; and 2) CCN’s concerns regarding the UIRs (Unusual Incident Report) which \nresulted in delays in inputting into the UIR system because caseworkers and data entry staff were \n30 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 34 of 88 PageID #:2090\n \nnot timely completing the UIRs.  This resulted in CCN getting delayed referrals of youth who \nhad UIRs and may be eligible for the program.   DCFS saw this as a system-wide issue and has \nreplaced  the  UIR  system  with  the  Significant  Event  Reporting  System  which  reports  this \ninformation directly through the SACWIS system where CCN can access it more easily.   The \nreplacement of the UIR system with the Significant Event Reporting System alleviates the delay \nin referrals that had been experienced previously.  \nThe Operations Committee believes that the UIR issue has been resolved in the last two \nmonths, when DCFS changed the from the UIR system to the Significant Event Reporting \nSystem.  The Significant Event Reporting system is linked to SACWIS and provides more timely \nupdates to significant events that occur during a youth’s case. \nTo address the communication and referral pathway issue, CCN developed a protocol for \ncontact  between  CCN  management  and  management  with  the  assigned  private  agency  to \npromptly address the inadequate communication between the Wrap Facilitator and caseworkers.  \nExhibit I, Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved Youth, Four Month Status Report, \nApril 30, 2017. \nDashboard.    The  CCN  dashboard  is  operational,  but  still  requires some  validation.  \nExhibit J, CCN Intake Dashboard (data through 3/31/2017).   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nFunding.  Securing funding is an ongoing challenge. Both DCFS and the Governor’s \nOffice have provided support to CCN in their fundraising presentations.  If CCN’s fundraising \ngoal is not met, DCFS at the least will enter into contracts to continue serving youth assigned to \nthe pilot.  DCFS will also consider renegotiating the contract during the next reporting period.   \n31 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 35 of 88 PageID #:2091\n \nYouth Served.    The current goal is to serve 800 youth in the treatment group and 800 \nyouth in the control group over four years. \nProgram Refinement.  While services to youth continue through the program, DCFS \nwill monitor to ensure that the change to the Significant Event Reporting system has addressed \nthe UIR reporting issue since significant events are linked in the SACWIS system and provided \nin a more timely manner.  In addition, DCFS and CCN will monitor the communication issues \nidentified  above  regarding  referral  pathways  through  monthly  review  by  the  Operations \nCommittee with CCN regarding response time from the field when referrals are made.    \nDashboard.        The  Pay  for  Success  dashboard  has  been  developed  but  not  fully \ncompleted or validated.  It is anticipated that the completion of this dashboard and validation will \noccur during the next reporting period.  \n  Program Evaluation.  Because the purpose of the ramp up phase was to develop and \nwork out system-related issues, the University of Michigan will not be evaluating the program \nperformance during the ramp up phase. \nPanel Recommendation #2:  \nCreate  four  “immersion  sites”  of  small  geographic  areas  that  coincide  with  judicial \ncircuits to fully build, test and implement a core practice model that puts children and families at \nthe center of service planning and builds community and home-based services for children and \ntheir families. (Implementation Plan at pp. 25-38).    \n4.  Project Goals / Target: \nImmersion Sites are test or pilot sites representing a small geographic area where youth, \nbirth parents, foster parents, DCFS staff, private agency staff and multiple other stakeholders \nwork together to fully build and implement a “core practice model” of child welfare practice that \n32 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 36 of 88 PageID #:2092\n \nputs children and families at the center of service planning and builds community and home \nbased resources to service children and families.  DCFS intends to use Immersion Sites as the \ncenter of its transformation to improve safety, permanency and stability outcomes.   \nTo date, the immersion site process has started in four cities:  Lake County, St. Clair \nCounty, the Rock Island area (including Rock Island, Whiteside, Mercer, and Henry counties), \nand the five “Mount Vernon area” counties (Clay, Hamilton, Jefferson, Marion, and Wayne).  \nFigure 1 charts the caseflow dynamics for each of the immersion sites extending back to \nfiscal year 1981. The data illustrate that three of the four sites experienced peak caseload growth \nin the mid-1990s as foster care removals (entry cohorts) outpaced discharges (exit cohort). The \nrise occurred statewide (see Figure 2) and was attributed at the front-end to the cocaine epidemic \nthat precipitated the mass removal of substance exposed infants from parental custody and a \ngeneral inattention at the back-end to permanency planning options for children in long-term \nkinship care.  \n33 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 37 of 88 PageID #:2093\n \nFigure 1..—Caseflowwdynamics, FFY1981-20166, Immersionn sites\nTThe percentagge of childreen residing kkinship fosteer homes swwiftly increassed between 1986 \nto 1995 iin Illinois frrom 27% to 57% of out--of-home placements beefore a combbination of ffront-\nend  Homme-of-Relatiive  (HMR)  reforms  and  back-ennd  permanenncy  initiativves  reducedd  the \npercentagge to under 40%.

The first, which is the opinion of the Expert Panel and the parties, is that the child \nwelfare system retains children unnecessarily and far too long in foster care. This is particularly \ntrue for children who are taken into foster care in Cook County, where half the children are still \nin foster care after 1,200 days or 40 months. Cook County consistently registers among the \nlongest median lengths of stay compared to a national average of 14 months. Even though the \nmedian length of stay in the balance of Illinois is shorter than in Cook County, it has been \nsteadily rising and at 750 days or 24 months, downstate counties retain children in foster care \nlonger than 1,150 out of the 1,250 U.S. counties for which there are comparable measures. \nAn alternative opinion is that lengthier stays in foster care in Illinois appropriately reflect \nthe  clinical  needs  of  the  children  who  are  taken  into  foster  care  and  the  challenging \ncircumstances their families must overcome in order to regain custody. Because Illinois children \nare removed from their parents at far lower levels than children in other states (Illinois and \nVirginia are tied for the fewest removals per capita), the reasoning goes that children stay in care \nbecause good casework practice dictates that these children should remain in care in order to \nreceive the specialized care and trauma-informed treatment they need. \nIn order to test the comparative merits of these two alternative opinions, the parties \nagreed to the creation of four “immersion sites” of small geographic areas that coincide with \njudicial circuits to fully build, test and implement a core practice model that puts children and \nfamilies at the center of service planning and builds community and home-based services for \nchildren and their families. \nDCFS identified the key components to the process as: \n(i)   training and coaching of all DCFS and private agency staff in the new Family-\nCentered, Trauma-Informed, Strength-Based Practice Model practice model for \nservice delivery (referred to here as “FTS”);  \n(ii)  implementation of a new “Model of Supervisory Practice” or “MoSP;”  \n36 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 40 of 88 PageID #:2096\n \n(iiii)  integrration of its QQuality Assuurance Divission and Monnitoring Divvisions in thee \nimmerrsion sites inn order to immplement a nnew, Qualityy Service Revview Process \n(QSR);  \n(iiv)  develoopment of coommunity annd home bassed services for childrenn and familiees \nand seecuring Titlee IV-E waiveers to fund same;  \n(vv)   refinement of a daata tracking system to mmeasure outcoomes for chiildren;  \n(vvi)  revisioon of coveraage areas forr DCFS officces to align tthem with thhe boundariees of \nthe Sttate’s judiciaal circuits; annd  \n(vvii)   decenntralization aand internal, DCFS structtural changees to improvee case flow aand \nday-too-day operattional processses.   \nPProgram Evaaluation.  TThe independdent evaluatiion, which iss required byy the IV-E wwaiver \ndemonstrration,  will test  whetther  the  immplementatioon  of  the  core  practtice  model  and \naccompaanying systemmic reforms improve uppon safety, ppermanency and stabilityy outcomes. Two \nsorts of comparisonss will be drrawn for renndering thesse summary assessmentts: 1) withinn-site, \nhistoricall  comparisoons  and  22)  contemporaneous,  ccross-site  ccomparisonss  with  mattched \ngeographhical areas.  \n \n37 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 41 of 88 PageID #:2097\n \nFigure 4—Median Days in Foster Care, FY1981-2014, Immersion Site, Cook County and Balance of \nState \n  For example, Figure 4 shows that the median days that children in all four immersion \nsites remain in foster care track closely the trend line observed for the balance of the state outside \nof Cook County. Combining the data for all four immersion sites helps smoothen the trend lines \nthat jump around when plotted separately for each site. One of the indicators of success is \nwhether as a result of the roll-out of the core practice model and accompanying systemic \nreforms, the median length of stay in the immersion sites can be shorted to between 400 and 450 \ndays, which is more in line with national levels. In addition, contemporaneous comparisons can \nalso be drawn by comparing length of stay to a comparable sample of counties from the balance \nof state.  \nDCFS continues to track data on a statewide, regional and Immersion Site basis for the \nfollowing outcomes:  maltreatment in foster care, repeat maltreatment, child and family team \nmeetings, supervised and unsupervised visits, family reunification within five and 12 months, \npermanency within 12 months, total permanency achievements by month and year to date, \npermanency within 12 months, total permanency achievements by month and year to date, \nplacement moves, time to achieve family reunification and intact service levels.  Exhibit K, \nOutputs and Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites May 1, 2017.  \nHealth data will also be tracked for yearly EPSDT and dental checkups.  Exhibit K, \nOutputs and Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites May 1, 2017, pp. 1, \nXX-XX.  Historical data indicate that compliance for these checkup drops, however as children \nget older.  Additional requirements for review of health information have been added to the \nreview protocols for the Agency Performance Teams reviews of private agencies. Exhibit K, \nOutputs and Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites May 1, 2017.  If \n38 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 42 of 88 PageID #:2098\n \nmeaningful  improvements can be observed across several indicators in comparison to both \nhistorical data and comparable counties, a case for rolling-out the core practice model to another \nset of immersion sites will be strengthened. If no improvements are observed by the time of the \nroll-out to the second set of immersion sites, however, attention will either turn to other potential \nsolutions or reconsideration of whether current levels of observed performance are actually \nconsistent with best practice. \nThe Implementation Plan set the following target dates:  finalization of Title IV-E waiver \nby September 2016 (now complete), presentation of a Summit in October 2016 to announce the \nnew Core Practice Model (now complete), finalization of the QSR tool by November 2016 \n(finished late); completion of QSR training by January 30, 2017 (incomplete), and pilot use of \nthe QSR process in at least one immersion site by February 1, 2017 (complete).   \nDCFS originally projected that it would take until September, 2017 to complete the \nprocess in the first four Immersion Sites, and roll-out to additional sites was to occur on a regular \nbasis with a target state-wide completion date of 2019. \n5.  Status Report:   \nRoll-Out to New Immersion Sites.  The timeline for expansion to new Immersion Sites \nhas not yet been revised.  Rolling out the model to the next set of immersion sites, even before \nthe evaluation of the initial roll-out has been completed, will strengthen the overall evaluation. \nHowever, it remains unclear whether the completion date of September 2019 will be met. \nFTS Training and Implementation.  Critical to the success of any pilot initiative is \nassuring  that  a  sufficient  proportion  of  the  intended  recipients  actually  receive  the  desired \nintervention. Ninety-seven percent of the staff in the Immersion Sites completed FTS training.  \nMake-up sessions are being offered on a rotating basis between Immersion Sites for the staff that \n39 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 43 of 88 PageID #:2099\n \ndid not complete the FTS training and for newly hired staff.   Four Month Status Report Update \nImmersion Sites; Four Month Status Report Update Core Practice Model.  A web-based, self-\ndirected  version  of  FTS  training  is  currently  in  development  and  will  replace  the  makeup \nsessions in the future.   \nDCFS identified staff in the Immersion Sites who needed a more limited version of the \nFTS training and those staff completed the abbreviated self-directed version of FTS training.  \nNinety-four  percent  of  the  staff  identified  completed  the  abbreviated  self-directed  training \nthrough March 31, 2017.  The following shows the completed FTS classroom trainings by \nImmersion Site: \nTotal targeted CLASS ROOM \n458    \nparticipants 4 \nTotal participants who have \ncompleted FTS CLASS ROOM  446  97.38% \ntraining \nTotal participants registered for \n0  0.00% \nupcoming CLASS ROOM training \nTotal participants not completed or \nnot registered for CLASS ROOM  12  2.62% \ntraining \nTotal participants scheduled for \nSELF DIRECTED learning - NON  59 \nRESIDENTIAL 5 \n  \nTotal participants completed SELF \nDIRECTED learning - NON  56  94.92% \nRESIDENTIAL \n \nProcedure 315 Training.

The training will include a combination of \nclassroom training and individual coaching.  Initial presentation of the training in Immersion \nsites is currently scheduled to begin in December.  A training schedule will be developed during \nthe next reporting period.  \nCFTM Training. Significant delay was encountered in finalizing and executing the \ncontract with CWG.  The contract was finally signed on April 10, 2017.  Under this contract, \nCWG will provide both training and coaching for the CFTM and the QSR processes.   \nCWG has completed the CFTM curriculum, including a “Preparing and Facilitating Child \nand  Family  Team  Meetings  Illinois  Department  of  Children  and  Family  Services  Trainer \nManual” and a “Preparing and Facilitating Child and Family Team Meetings Illinois Department \nof Children and Family Services Participant Workbook.”     \nDCFS  and  CWG  developed  a  plan  for  moving  forward  on  the  CFTM  training  and \ncoaching.  CWG consultants and Immersion Site directors met in May 2017 to analyze local data \nand develop a one day Leadership Summit for each Immersion Site for the broader child welfare \ncommunity to explain the importance of the CFTM training and the role of the QSR process in \noverall  quality  improvement.    CWG  staff  aligned  specific  trainers  and  coaches  in  each \nImmersion Site. During June 2017, the one day Leadership Summits are scheduled in each \nImmersion Site.  The first round of CFTM training will commence in July or August 2017 in \neach Immersion Site.   \nQSR Training and Implementation.  The CWG contract also provides for training and \nsupport for the QSR process.  CWG recommends that the training be done in parts:  an initial \ntraining, participation in an on-site review and, after the conclusion of three on-site reviews with \n41 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 45 of 88 PageID #:2101\n \nthe participation of a CWG mentor, additional advanced training that will prepare them to \nbecome a mentor/trainer in the QSR process going forward.  Exhibit C, Four Month Status \nReport, Immersion Sites. \nThe current goal is to have a total of eight QSR reviewers who are able to complete \nindependent QSR reviews and are then able to train and mentor other staff to complete the QSR \nprocess.  To date, DCFS has hired four dedicated QSR reviewers, one headquartered in each \nImmersion Site.  The QSR process includes case sampling for each review, identification of \ncase-stakeholders for in-person interviews, review of case documentation, rating of the case and \nworker on the specific case. Exhibit XX, Four Month Status Report, Immersion Sites. \nService Provision.   Contracts for lead agencies in each of the Immersion Sites were \nfinalized and executed in April 2017.  The lead agencies are:  United Methodist Children’s Home \nin the Mount Vernon Immersion Site, Lessie Bates Davis in the East St. Louis Immersion Site, \nBethany in the Rock Island Immersion Site and NiCASA in the Lake County Immersion Site.  \nExhibit C, Four Month Status Report, Immersion Sites. \nThe contracts provide for delivery of intensive and in-home evidence based services \nwithin the Immersion Sites.  Each contract is premised on wrap-around principles and contains \nflexible funding for the development of individualized services and supports to meet the needs of \nindividual families. Each Immersion Site program was taking referrals by the first week in June.  \nTraining in an evidence-based wraparound principles was also completed during the first week in \nJune.  The flexible funding provided and the community networks supporting each program \nmake it possible to engage a wide array of individualized services for families and their children, \nsuch as emergency housing through the now de-centralized Norman funds; support services for \nsubstance abuse, mental health, domestic violence; and family support services such as child \n42 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 46 of 88 PageID #:2102\n \ncare, home aides and parent education.  Family needs and strength are defined through the \nCFTM process and the lead agency providing the service array is responsible for responding to \nthe defined needs identified in the CFTM.  Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report, Immersion \nSites. \nIV-E Waiver.  The Administration for Children and Youth asked DCFS to provide a \ndetailed plan for implementation of the IV-E waiver by April 2017.  DCFS has submitted that \ndetailed plan.  The Waiver has been granted and the additional funding and flexibility is built \ninto the DCFS budget.  \nOffice Realignment.  DCFS developed a plan to align regional and field offices with \njudicial circuits.  It was anticipated that the plan would be ready for review by the Director and \nfor union negotiations by March 31, 2017.  That has not yet occurred.   \nRestructuring and Decentralization.  DCFS continues to work on structural issues to \nbetter align with practice goals and expectations in the Immersion Sites.   \nDCFS committed to “retooling” the Integrated Assessment process, to transformation of \nthe CIPP process into the CFTM process, and to delegation of the placement matching process to \nteams in the Immersion Sites by April 30, 2017, and further committed to developing a plan for \nstatewide implementation by the end of the current reporting period. Discussions with CWG led \nto the conclusion that the exact role of Integrated Assessment and how it fits with the CFTM \ntraining and coaching going forward requires more study.   \n6.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nRoll-Out to New Sites,  DCFS is planning to hold its Second Annual Transformation \nSummit on August 8, 2017 to August 10, 2017 in Springfield, Illinois.  The theme of the Summit \nis “Pursuing Permanency:  Cultivating, Maintaining and Supporting Lifelong Connections.”  \n43 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 47 of 88 PageID #:2103\n \nExhibit L Save the Date PDF document.  However, it is still too early to roll out the Immersion \nSite process in any additional locations, and it also is still too early to state with confidence \nwhether  statewide  rollout  by  September  2019  is  realistic.    DCFS  will  consult  and  work \ncollaboratively with the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs regarding any adjustments in the timeline for \nadding new Immersion Sites for the remainder of the state.     \nFTS  Training  and  Implementation.    This  has  been  completed  in  the  four  initial \nImmersion Sites, as over 97% of DCFS and private agency staff have been trained. Makeup \nsessions will be made available for staff that still require training and a web-based training will \nbe developed for future training.  \nProcedure 315 Training.  All staff in the Immersion Sites have completed this required \ntraining.     \nMoSP.  The MoSP training is projected to begin in December 2017.   \nChild and Family Team Training.   The Immersion Site directors and staff from CWG \nwill meet by the end of May 2017 to complete a data analysis and develop Leadership Summits \nfor community stakeholders in each Immersion Site regarding the importance of and the plan for \nimplementing CFTM training in each site.   \nThe Leadership Summits that must precede CFTM training will be held by the end of \nJune 2017.  Initial CFTM training will commence in July 2017 and run through August 2017. \nThe initial training will include 18 supervisors and six coach candidates and the training will \ninclude both education and observation.   Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report, Immersion Sites.  \nThe training plan includes training coaches who will be trained to facilitate CFTMs, to coach \nCFTMs and then to become Master Coaches and Trainers for other DCFS and provider agency \nstaff.  The goal is to develop the initial coach candidates into Master Coaches by December \n44 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 48 of 88 PageID #:2104\n \n2017.  Master coaches will be approved to develop additional cohorts of supervisors and coaches \nand to provide the CFTM training to additional staff.  Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report, \nImmersion Sites. \nThe second round of CFTM training is scheduled to commence in September 2017.  This \nschedule is subject to modification based on the progress of round one CFTM trainees.     \nQuality Service Review Process.  The four dedicated QSR reviewers will conduct a \nsecond round of QSR reviews with the CWG mentors in June 2017 after they complete a \nrefresher training with CWG on June 1-2, 2017. A second group of new QSR reviewers are \nscheduled to begin training in August 2017.  DCFS will work closely with CWG to make any \nneeded adjustments to this schedule.  \nService Delivery.  With lead agency contracts now in place for each Immersion Site, the \nDCFS Clinical Division will guide development and implementation of in-home services.  The \nClinical Division has provided consulting in the development of each Immersion Site’s service \narray. DCFS is building service level expectations into each of the lead agency contracts.  The \nImmersion Site Directors will be responsible for identifying gaps in available services.  Service \ngaps  will  be  identified  and  solutions  developed  through the  ongoing  stakeholders  planning \nprocess which is active in each Immersion Site.  \nRealignment of Office Areas.  The plan for realignment has been completed but not yet \nexecuted.  When Interim Director Spacapan takes office she will be briefed and decisions will \nmade as to the next steps that need to be taken with regard to the realignment plan.  \nRestructuring and Decentralization.  During the next reporting period, DCFS will \nwork intensely with the CWG staff to develop a plan, including a timeline and action steps to \nfully align the Integrated Assessment process into the Child and Family Team process and to \n45 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 49 of 88 PageID #:2105\n \nintegrate clinical staff into that process. In that same timeframe, the CIPP assessment and \nplanning process will be progressively transitioned into the CFTM process as the CFTM training \nand coaching is implemented. The Central Matching Unit is currently delegated to the Immersion \nSites and will be fully integrated into the CFTM process as the CFTM training and coaching \nproceeds.  Full implementation of integration of the matching process into the CFTMs will be \ncompleted as the CFTM training and coaching process achieves its goal of creating a total of 96 \nCFTM facilitators, master coaches and coaches in December 2017. \nClinical staff will be engaged in cases where youth experience more complex behavioral \nand emotional problems from the very beginning of the case and will remain involved with the \nCFTM.  These assessments will drive the development of individualized plans and the delivery \nof needed services for youth with serious mental health and behavioral needs. \nProgram Evaluation.  Details of the outputs and proximal and distal outcomes are stated \nin considerable detail in the status report on Immersion Sites.  A few highlights include outputs \nsuch as deepening worker knowledge of the family centered, trauma informed and strength based \nframework which is the foundation of the DCFS practice and deepening worker understanding of \nthe path to permanency enhanced by new opportunities, such as family finding, state subsidized \nguardianship and fictive kin.  In addition, a plan will be developed during the next reporting \nperiod to address the apparent failure to timely provide EPSDT screenings and dental care to \nolder youth.  This plan will be implemented in the Immersion Sites.  \nF.  Panel Recommendation #3: \nFund a set of permanency planning initiatives to improve permanency outcomes for \nadolescents who enter state custody at age 12 or older either by transitioning youth to permanent \nhomes  or  preparing  them  for  reconnection  to  their  birth  families  reaching  adulthood.  \n(Implementation Plan, pp. 38-42).   \n46 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 50 of 88 PageID #:2106\n \nDCFS is pursuing two initiatives in accordance with this Recommendation – the Fictive \nKin/  State  Funded  Guardianship,  and  Family  Finding.  Figure  5  updates  the  statewide \npermanency chart for older youth, which was included in Report of the Expert Panel that was \nsubmitted  to  the  Court  in  July  of  2015.  It  was  the  opinion  of  the  Expert  Panel  that  the \npermanency options made available to adolescents who were unable to reconnect with their birth \nfamilies were either too few or insufficiently explored by DCFS. Recent data show an uptick in \nthe percentage of older children who are returned to their parents’ homes. This is a welcomed \nchange.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Report  of  the  Expert  Panel  showed  that  less  than  3%  of \nadolescents who entered DCFS at age 12 or older were discharged to permanent guardianship \narrangements within 5 years of case opening. Two years later, the update data show that the \npercentage has declined even further to 2%.  This compares to 7% that was the norm during the \nmid-2000s. Placement of older youth in adoptive homes has also declined. Even though more \nshould be done to find adoptive homes for older youth in care, the termination of parental rights \n(TPR) and reassignment of legal responsibilities to another set of parents have always been a \ndifficult transition for older youth to accept.   \n47 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 51 of 88 PageID #:2107\n \n \nFigure 5——Permanencyy Outcomes wwithin Five Yeears of Case OOpening, Chiildren Aged 12 and older aat \nCase Opeening \n \nRRegular telecconference ccalls regardiing the statuus of B.H. projects witth DCFS prroject \nmanagerss,  the  Expeert  Panel,  aand  the  parrties  have  rreinforced  thhe  need  for  expandingg  the \npermanenncy options available too older youthh.

Each  initiative  is  discussed \nseparately below. \nG.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Amended Definition of “Fictive Kin” \n1.  Project Goals/Target  \nThe Implementation Plan contemplates that amendments to expand the definition of \nfictive kin will improve permanency options and lead to improved well-being.  DCFS committed \nto updating its administrative rules with the expanded definition of fictive kin after January 1, \n2017, which was the effective date of the statutory change to the Children and Family Services \nAct.  Implementation Plan, pp. 39-40. \n2.  Status Report:    \nDCFS is currently engaged in rulemaking for DCFS Rules 300, 301, 302, 304, 309, 315, \n328, 337, 338, 359 and 402, which includes the updated definition of fictive kin.  The First \nNotice period was completed on April 3, 2017 and DCFS received no comments on the proposed \nchanges.  DCFS is proceeding in Second Notice and anticipates this will be completed within \napproximately 60 days.  Exhibit M, Four Month Status Report Amended Definition of Fictive \nKin and Expanding State Funded Guardianship.    \nTraining  on  revised  Procedure  315,  Permanency  Planning,  includes  training  on  the \nexpanded definition of fictive kin.  All immersion site permanency and adoption staff have \ncompleted Procedure 315 training.  Additional staff throughout the state are also engaged in \nrevised Procedure 315 training, which was scheduled for completion by May 31, 2017.   Exhibit \nM, Four Month Status Report Amended Definition of Fictive Kin and Expanding State Funded \nGuardianship.   \nDCFS continues to track placements with fictive kin.  As previously reported, from \nJanuary 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016, there were 1236 youth placed with fictive kin.  From \n49 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 53 of 88 PageID #:2109\n \nJanuary 1, 2017 to May 1, 2017, 650 youth statewide have been placed with fictive kin, with 37 \nof those placements made after February 28, 2017.  At the present time, DCFS is unable to \nidentify how many of the 650 fictive kin placements made through May 1, 2017 are attributable \nto the expanded definition of fictive kin.  However, DCFS is currently developing business rules \nwhich will be able to identify those fictive kin placements due to the expended definition of \nfictive kin.  Exhibit M, four Month Status Report Amended Definition of Fictive Kin and \nExpanding State Funded Guardianship.   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  \nTracking Outcomes. DCFS will continue tracking placements and outcomes of youth in \nfictive kin homes to monitor for safety, stability and permanency.  The mechanism for tracking \nyouth in fictive kin is a dashboard in the Mindshare platform.  Safety and permanency will be \nmeasured by no moves being recorded for those youth who have been placed in the home of \nfictive kin.  The permanency for those youth will be tracked via discharge to either home of \nparent/home or home of guardian of home of adoptive parent where a previous home fictive kin \nwas recorded.  Any placement move from fictive kin will be provided in a report for regional \nreview and follow-up for stability.  \nTraining – Procedure 315.  The completion date for DCFS training on Procedure 315 \nhas been revised.   Per the DCFS Training Division, there are approximately 160 staff that still \nneed to be trained and some newly hired staff who will also need this training.  Based on this \ninformation, the anticipated timeline for completion is June 30, 2017.  The anticipated date for \nthe self-directed web based training for investigative and intact staff is also June 30, 2017. \n  Data Collection.  Project management staff are working on clarification and completion \nof business rules and data elements for Family Finding and state-funded guardianship/Kin Gap.  \n50 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 54 of 88 PageID #:2110\n \nOnce those rules and data elements are completed, the project managers will review them with \nthe Expert Panel to ensure that the appropriate information is being collected.     \nH.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Expanding State Funded Guardianship \n1.  Project Goals/Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplates that DCFS will \namend its administrative rules to expand the eligibility for state funded guardianship.  DCFS \ncommitted to completing the amendments by December 2016. Implementation Plan, p. 39. \n2.  Status  Report:    DCFS  is  currently  engaged  in  rulemaking  for  DCFS  Rule \n302.410 which includes the expanded definition of state funded guardianship.  The First Notice \nperiod was completed on April 17, 2017 and DCFS received no comments on the proposed rule \nchange.  DCFS is proceeding to Second Notice and anticipates this will be completed within \napproximately 60 days.  Exhibit M, Four Month Status Report Amended Definition of Fictive \nKin and Expanding State Funded Guardianship, p. 1 \nEffective  April  1,  2017,  Administrative  Case  Review  (ACR)  staff  are  required  to \nimplement questions during every ACR to assure that state-funded guardianship is being pursued \nfor all eligible youth 12 years of age and older where the goals of return home and adoption have \nbeen ruled out.  Information on the responses will be included in the ACR feedbacks and the \nACR reporting system.  Eventually, data will also be collected through the dashboards of the \nMindshare platform.  \nInitial data from the ACR system, as an example, indicates that state funded guardianship \nis being pursued for youth in eleven of 16 applicable child cases reviewed where a child is \nplaced in a non-licensed relative home and in 15 out of 19 cases in which the youth was placed \nin  a  licensed  non-relative  home  during  the  ACR  process  in  April  2017.   State  funded \nguardianship should have been pursued for all of those cases but was not because the question of \n51 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 55 of 88 PageID #:2111\n \nwhether state funded guardianship was not being asked at the ACR in all cases where a youth \nmight be eligible.  To address this, effective July 1, 2017, the question of whether state funded \nguardianship is being pursued with be asked at ACRs for all youth age 12 and older who have \npermanency  goals  other  than  adoption.  Previously,  the  question  of  whether  state  funded \nguardianship was being asked only for those youth age 12 and older who have a goal of \nguardianship.  To be eligible, youth also must be placed in a non-licensed or licensed relative \nhome.  Siblings under the age of 12 who are placed in the same home as an eligible youth are \nalso afforded the state funded guardianship option.   Exhibit M, Four Month Status Report \nAmended Definition of Fictive Kin and Expanding State Funded Guardianship.  \nDCFS previously committed to developing a dashboard in the Mindshare platform that \nwill allow program managers to be able to identify youth eligible for specific subsidies, such as \nthe state funded guardianship program, in order to move them to permanency.  To date, the \ndashboard has not been developed and no target completion date has been set.   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  \nCompletion of the rulemaking process for state funded guardianship should be completed \nby  July  31,  2017. Commencing  in  this  reporting  period,  regular  monthly  reports  will  be \ngenerated on youth eligible for state funded guardianship and the KinGAP program.  Exhibit M, \nFour Month Status Report Amended Definition of Fictive Kin and Expanding State Funded \nGuardianship.  Youth eligible for the programs will be identified by a review of the youth’s age, \npermanency goal and type of living arrangement.  The monthly reports will contain identifying \ninformation regarding the youth in care, including the age of the youth, the type and date of the \ncurrent placement, the current permanency goal and the date the current permanency goal was \nset.   Cases with potential eligibility for state funded guardianship and KinGap will be identified \n52 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 56 of 88 PageID #:2112\n \nby ACR reviewers, Adoption Specialists and Agency Performance Team staff.  ACR still send \nan alert or critical notice to the assigned caseworker, supervisor, regional adoption supervisor \nand regional agency performance staff.  Adoption staff, along with agency performance staff, \nwill be responsible for addressing eligibility for guardianship with the assigned caseworker and \nsupervisor.  \nThe Mindshare dashboard for state-funded guardianship and KinGAP will be completed \nduring the next reporting period and the date for the completed validation of the dashboard will \nbe determined once the dashboard has been finalized. The finalization of the dashboard in the \nMindshare platform will eliminate the need for multiple monthly reports.   \nTripling the percentage of youth who attain permanence after entering foster care at ages \n12 and older from its current level to 6% at the end of an entry cohort’s third year in foster care \nis a reasonable goal. Work will commence on achieving this object first in the immersion sites. \n53 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 57 of 88 PageID #:2113\n \n \n \nFigure 6 Permanency Outcomes for Children Agged 12 and OOlder at Entryy into Foster CCare, \nImmersioon Sites \n  Figure 6 commpares the peermanency ouutcomes witthin five yeaars of case oppening for yoouth \nwho enteered care at aages 12 years old and oldder in the fouur immersioon sites. The utilization oof \nsubsidizeed guardiansship has falleen off in all iimmersion sites, with thee exception of Rock Islaand. \nIn spite oof the slight uuptick in reuunification raates in East SSt. Louis and Mt. Vernoon, the overaall \ntrend hass been downwward in all immmersion siites. As a ressult, the perccentage of yoouth who turrn 18 \nyears oldd while in carre has doublled in all immmersion sitess from 15% in the 1980ss to 30% in tthe \n2010s. AAs the prospeects for legall permanencee diminish shharply for yoouth who atttain majorityy age \nwhile in care, the chaances that these young foolks will agee out of care without the support of aa \n54 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 58 of 88 PageID #:2114\n \npermanent family is highly probable. Some of these former youth in care will find their way \nsafely back to their families of origin, but a substantial fraction will experience bouts of \nhomelessness, fall prey to sexual trafficking, or end up in toxic relationships. For these reasons, \nit is extremely important to prevent these adverse experiences to the extent possible by \nembedding youth in relationships of both relational and legal permanence before they reach the \nage of majority, \nI.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Family Finding \n1.  Project Goals/Target: One of the initiatives DCFS is undertaking to ensure that \nno youth ages out of foster care without some permanent family connection is Family Finding. \nThe Implementation Plan requires DCFS to implement specific “family finder” strategies as part \nof  permanency  planning  for  adolescents  who  do  not  have  an  obvious  reunification  plan. \nImplementation  Plan,  p.  40.    The  goal  of  DCFS’s  Family  Finding  strategy  is  to  improve \npermanency outcomes for all youth by identifying family that can serve as potential placements, \nsupports or resources for youth.  Implementation Plan, pp. 40-42. Per DCFS procedures, a goal \nof “independence” should never be assigned to children under the age of 16 years old. But even \nfor older children, the independence goal should be used sparingly. It is extremely difficult for \nyouth to establish and maintain lifelong supports and connections on their own, even after family \nfinding activities have taken place. Thus every effort should be made to explore adoption and \nsubsidized guardianship options with a youth’s current caregiver or identify through family \nfinding efforts other individuals who are willing to make a permanency commitment as a legal \nguardian to whom the youth can look to for guidance, encouragement, and membership as they \ntransition to adulthood. \nDCFS committed to revising its rules and procedures to enhance family finding efforts on \nall levels. Family finding efforts are to be conducted for all children and youth entering care with \n55 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 59 of 88 PageID #:2115\n \na return-home goal. The revised rules and procedures will require all child protection, intact and \npermanency staff to seek out non-custodial parents, relatives and fictive kin when placing a child \nor youth. \nDCFS further committed to requiring Permanency Achievement Specialists within each \nDCFS region to conduct family finding tasks, and that these Specialists would be available to \nboth DCFS and private agency staff to provide technical assistance on complex or difficult cases \nto identify barriers to permanency through methods of file mining, family meetings, trainings or \nother assistance. The self-directed web-based training for Family Findings began in March 2017 \nand is available to DCFS staff, private agency staff, and administrators via the DCFS Virtual \nTraining Center.  The web-based training currently is a component part of the Foundations \ntraining for new permanency staff, and will be included in the Foundations training for child \nprotection staff as well.  \n Additionally, the Plan states that ACR staff will flag cases where family finding is not \noccurring or where there is a barrier to permanency so that DCFS and private agency staff can be \nmade aware of the issues and take steps to rectify the problems. \nNo dates for the above commitments were specified in the Implementation Plan.  During \nthe next reporting period, DCFS will set target dates for accomplishing these objectives now that \nis has a concrete plan. \n2.  Status Report:   \nRefocused Efforts on Youth 12 and Older.  In the prior Report, DCFS committed to \nrefocus its family finding efforts on adolescents with emotional and behavioral health in order to \nlocate additional placements or supports for those children.  DCFS has identified youth over the \nage of 12 to determine whether any family finding activities were completed for the child.  \n56 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 60 of 88 PageID #:2116\n \nRelying on DCFS form 151-H or through a case note, DCFS has identified 698 youth out of \n31,547 youth to date who have had family finding activities documented in their case files \nthrough the DCFS 151-H form or through a case note. This data was pulled from all youth who \nentered care at age 12 or who became 12 years of age or older from July 2010 to April 30, 2017.  \nExhibit N, Four Month Status Update, Family Findings.  DCFS has a number of strategies to \naddress those cases where no family findings efforts are documented. For those youth, when an \nACR is held on the case, the ACR reviewer will send a feedback to the assigned caseworker and \nsupervisor.  A feedback is a narrative report used by the ACR to provide case status information \nin relationship to permanency, safety and well-being of the children in care and their families.  \nThere are three types of feedbacks: \n1)      The Monthly Feedback which is a written summary of the status of a case after it \nhas been administratively reviewed. The Monthly Feedback documents that DCFS \npolicy is being followed, that there is a plan for permanency, that the youth’s needs \nare being met and that the youth are safe while in the custody of DCFS; \n2)  The Monthly Feedback with Alert issues is a written summary of a lack of needed \nservices to children and/or families and/or unmet needs that jeopardize a child’s \nsafety, well-being and/or timely achievement of permanency.  The alert feedback is \nalso used to address specific issues that have not risen to a critical level, but need the \nattention to present the issue from rising to a critical level.  The alert feedback is \ndesigned to address moderate risk issues requiring further action and resolution by the \nworker and supervisor.  \n3)  The Critical Feedback is a written summary of issues where there is a violation of \nDCFS rules, procedures or policies, laws or court orders that endanger the safety, \n57 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 61 of 88 PageID #:2117\n \nwell-being and/or permanency of children and youth for whom DCFS is responsible, \nincluding neglect of a child’s mental health, medical or safety needs.  \n4)  The interim Feedback is a written narrative indicating the status of resolution for a \npreviously identified critical issue. This feedback is only written on cases following \nan interim ACR which is required within one to three months following identification \nof a critical issue.  This interim feedback is to help ensure that the critical issue is \nbeing address for resolution expeditiously.  \nDCFS project management staff will also provide reports to Regional Administrators for \ncases  in  their  region  who  have  had  no  family  findings  work  completed.    The  Regional \nAdministrators will review the reports and provide them to assigned caseworker and supervisory \nstaff to ensure that the family findings work is being completed. \nMindshare Dashboard.  DCFS staff completed work on the Family Finding dashboard \nin  the Mindshare  platform.    Exhibit  N,  Four  Month  Status  Update,  Family  Findings.  That \ndashboard,  which  still  requires  validation,  went  live  on  April  14,  2017.    The  dashboard \nencompasses all youth in care, however, specific measures for youth ages 12 and older are being \nreviewed and validated.  Those specific measures include:  the number of youth ages 12 and \nolder with noted relative or fictive kin supports; the type of living arrangement where the youth \nresides, such as placement with relatives (HMR), fictive kin (HFK) or home of relative (HMP), \nafter  family  finding  efforts  were  completed;  the  length  of  stay  in  each  type  of  placement \n(indicating stability) and legal permanency type.   Exhibit N, Four Month Status Update, Family \nFinding.  \nInclusion of Family Finding in ACR.  Effective April 1, 2017, ACR staff are required \nto ask questions at every ACR to assure that family finding activities have been completed.  This \n58 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 62 of 88 PageID #:2118\n \ninformation will be contained in ACR feedbacks and in the ACR reporting system. Initial data \nindicates that family finding activities, through a review of the case by the ACR reviewer, were \ncompleted in 632 of 864 applicable child cases that had an ACR review in April 2017.  Exhibit \nN, Four Month Status Update, Family Findings.     \nWebinar  Training.    On  March  2,  2017,  the  Family  Finding  webinar  training  was \nreleased.  It is mandatory on-line training for all child protection and permanency staff and \nsupervisors.  As of April 28, 2017, 1,045 staff completed or are in process of completing the \ntraining.  Exhibit N, Four Month Status Update, Family Finding.   \nProcedure 315 Training.  DCFS began offering training on Procedure 315 in its revised \nformat, which addresses family findings issues, in December 2016.  A separate, self-directed \nweb based training on Family Findings, which provides an overview of the family finding \nphilosophy  and  direction  on  how  to  complete  and  record  family  findings  activities,  was \nimplemented in March 2017 on the DCFS Virtual Training Center.  DCFS previously anticipated \nthat by May 31, 2017, all permanency staff would have completed the training.   During the next \nreporting period, DCFS will report on whether that goal was met. \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nRefocused Efforts on Youth 12 and Older.  DCFS is currently completing the plan for \nrefocusing its family findings efforts for youth in care who are ages 12 and older.  This plan will \nbe completed by the end of June 2017.  \nEfforts Addressed to Remaining Youth.  The B.H. Expert Panel suggested inclusion of \nthe  0-3  population  to  family  finding/sub  guardianship/expanded  KinGap.  The  Mindshare \ndashboard will have fiscal year entry cohorts, so DCFS will be able to review if the youth who \nare entering care have family finding activities completed. These dashboards encompass all \n59 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 63 of 88 PageID #:2119\n \nyouth in care regardless of their age.  The reports will permit data sorting by DCFS region, POS \nagencies and DCFS offices. It will also allow for the isolation of the targeted population of those \nyouth over the age of 12 and those youth ages 0-3.  \nMindshare  Dashboard.    DCFS  will  complete  validation  of  the  Family  Finding \ndashboard by June 30, 2017.  A meeting is scheduled for June 8, 2017 to discuss finalization and \ndetermine if other business rules are required since family finding, fictive kin and state-funded \nguardianship were combined into one project as they are interrelated.  These were combined \nafter review by the B.H. Expert Panel and the decision that family finding is an activity that will \nhelp assist in the identification of relative or fictive kin, which may lead to permanency through \nthe state funded guardianship and KinGap options for youth.   \nInclusion of Family Finding in ACR.  Family finding questions were added to the ACR \nreview packet effective April 1, 2017.  These reports will be sent to the Regional Administrators \nto be disseminated to both DCFS permanency staff as well as POS permanency staff.  This \ninformation  will  also  be  sent  via  feedback  system  described  above.    The  DCFS  Regional \nAdministrators will be responsible to ensure staff are completing the family findings work in \naccordance with DCFS procedures   \nWebinar Training.  The target date for completion of the Webinar training has been \nextended to June 30, 2017. The web-based training is now a part of Foundations training for all \npermanency/placement staff/and will remain on the VTC for all other disciplines.   \nProcedure 315 Training.  The target date for completion of this training has been \nextended to June 30, 2017.  \nJ.  Panel Recommendation #4: \nRetain an organizational consultant to aid DCFS in “rebooting” a number of stalled \ninitiatives that are intended to address the needs of children and youth with psychological, \n60 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 64 of 88 PageID #:2120\n \nbehavioral or emotional challenges” (Implementation Plan, pp. 42-43). Recommendation #4 \naddresses two points - DCFS reorganization, and “rebooting” stalled initiatives intended to meet \nthe needs of specific youth.  DCFS identified two initiatives that needed to be “rebooted.”  \nDCFS’s reorganization and those two programs – Birth to Three (IB3) and Safe Families for \nChildren  (SFC)  –  are  discussed  below.    In  addition,  DCFS  identified  various  IT  projects, \nincluding updating or expanding certain information systems and applications and implementing \na data analytics system intended to alert investigators of children at exceptionally high risk of \nserious harm, as part of its response to this Recommendation.  Those projects are also addressed \nbelow.  \nK.  Expert Panel Recommendation # 4:  Reorganization  \n1.  Project Goals / Target: The Implementation Plan called for DCFS to create a \nhigh level unit with cross-organization authority to develop an implementation plan, manage the \nimplementation and resolve system barriers. It also noted that the organizational consultant \nshould evaluate the organizational structure and culture of DCFS; the effectiveness of DCFS’ \npolicies,  procedures  and  programs;  the  effectiveness  of  DCFS’s  leadership  and  managerial \nstructure and function and to assess the supervisory functions of the agency.  Implementation \nPlan at pp. 42-43. \n2.  Status Report:  Director Sheldon has announced his resignation effective June \n15, 2017.  DCFS General Counsel Lise T. Spacapan has been named the Interim Director.  The \nGovernor’s Office has advised that a nationwide search for a new Director will be undertaken. \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  None at this time.  \nL.  Panel Recommendation # 4:  Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \n61 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 65 of 88 PageID #:2121\n \nThe Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) is a five-year federal demonstration project that \nbegan in 2012 which DCFS will complete within the original timeframe specified in the terms \nand conditions of its IV-E waiver agreement with the federal government. The project provides \ntwo evidence-based interventions, singly or in combination – Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) \nand Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) – to parents and children in Cook County, regardless of \nTitle IV-E eligibility, in order to reunify children with their parents more quickly and reduce the \nrisk of re-entry to the child welfare system.  Implementation Plan, pp. 22-26. \n2.  Status Report:  DCFS still intends to complete the pilot by September 30, 2018, \nand seek renewal of the waiver for an additional year.  The target number of children to be \nserved through the program is 2,400.  Since the last reporting period, an additional 50 children \nwere added to the program, which increases the total to 1,816.  It is anticipated that another 580 \nchildren will be enrolled when the 5-year enrollment period ends on June 30, 2018. Exhibit O, \nFour Month Status Report:  Illinois Birth Through Three Project, p. 1.  \nLoss of Credentialed Staff.  DCFS previously noted that one challenge to the program \nwas that participating agencies were having difficulty retaining credentialed staff.  The project \nnow  employs  a  CPP  consultant  who  can  support  linking  newly  hired  staff  with  Learning \nCollaboratives as well as provide support as they gain experience. Similarly, the statewide \nexpansion of NPP will allow for ongoing training of new providers.  The program is now fully \nstaffed. \nLack  of  Engagement  by  Birth  and  Foster  Parents.    Another  difficulty  with  the \nprogram has been encountered due to a lack of engagement by some birth and foster parents.  \nDCFS developed a model of on-site field support for participating agencies, with a support \nspecialists assigned to each agency.  The specialists were on-site on a monthly basis to provide \n62 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 66 of 88 PageID #:2122\n \ncoaching and support.  In addition, specific offices and agencies were targeted for case status \nreviews7 and permanency plans for IB3-involved families.    These services continue and will be \nexpanded. The primary lesson has been that it is important to distinguish parental compliance \nwith IB3 services from progress in all domains addressed by the service plan. Key parent \nrisk/safety factors (rooted in trauma history) and level of progress in addressing these concerns \nincluding: mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence, housing, and low or unstable \nincome were the common barriers that continued to adversely impact permanency. \nA significant issue for the program has been a lack of engagement by participants.  In the \nlast reporting period, DCFS committed to providing a 10% increase in the implementation \nsupport  for  this  program,  and  that  support  was  to  be  provided  for  10  agencies  providing \ncasework services to children enrolled in the IB3 program.  This increased commitment was \nintended to improve engagement in the program.  The additional support DCFS promised was \nprovided.   \nThere are currently three Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) groups for birth parents and \nall provider agencies are fully staffed.  NPP is one of the evidence-based interventions upon \nwhich the waiver is premised.  A total of 54 parents have completed the service during Fiscal \nYear 2017.  Exhibit O, Four Month Status Report:   Illinois Birth Through Three Project, p. 1.  \nThere is also a NPP in process for foster parents. A total of 27 foster parents have completed an \nNPP program during Fiscal Year 2017.  Of the 104 foster parents that have completed NPP, 48% \ncompleted  during  the  current  fiscal  year.  The  program  attributes  this  to  efforts  of  the \nimplementation team to engage agencies to commit to enhancing outcomes for this population.  \n                                                 \n7 The focus of these reviews is permanence, and the case under review is used to help illustrate \nand discuss parent / foster parent engagement and the available evidence-based interventions that \nshould be undertaken. \n63 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 67 of 88 PageID #:2123\n \nThe strategy for developing foster parent engagement is the addition of an on-site support \nspecialist for each agency that provides coaching and other supports. Exhibit O, Four Month \nStatus Report:  Illinois Birth Through Three Project, p. 1. \nDCFS has implemented a continuous quality improvement plan in a further effort to \nincrease the engagement rates for foster and birth parents served by the two agencies with the \nlowest engagement rates.  Exhibit O, Four Month Status Report:  Illinois Birth Through Three \nProject, p. 2.  The first phase of Child Parent Psychotherapy Continuous Quality Improvement \nmeetings has taken place.  Exhibit O, Four Month Status Report:  Illinois Birth Through Three \nProject, p. 1.  Data demonstrates that current engagement rates (of natural or foster parents or \nboth?) vary across the providers from a low of 41% to a high of 82%.  Data demonstrate that \ncurrent engagement rates of natural and foster parents has substantially improved with a mean of \n71%. The Support of the CPP consultant and the development of specific CQI plans for CPP will \ncontinue. \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: Permanency outcomes have finally begun to improve \nfor the better for the intervention group compared to the comparison group. The most notable \ndifference is the higher combined rate of reunification or placement into subsidized guardianship \nwith kin in the intervention (+8.8 percentage points), which exceeds the statistical threshold of \nsignificant  difference  (p  <  .010).  Excluding  guardianships,  however,  the  difference  in \nreunification  rates  (+5.0  percentage  points)  drops  below  the  conventional  threshold  of \nsignificance  but  still  is  trending  in  the  desired  direction  (p  <  .132).  The  higher  rate  of \nguardianship in the intervention group is offset to some extent by a higher rate of adoptions in \nthe  comparison  group,  which  narrows  the  difference  in  overall  permanency  rate  to  +4.4 \n64 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 68 of 88 PageID #:2124\n \npercentage points. While not statistically significant, the difference is trending in the expected \ndirection (p < .143). \nDespite  these  improvements,  only  25%  of  the  268  infants  and  toddlers  who  were \nscreened and referred to IB3 interventions during fiscal year 2014 had been reunified with their \nparents or permanently placed through adoption or guardianship after 24 months in care. This \nconstitutes only a marginal improvement over historical baselines and falls far short of the \ndesired goal of closing the permanency gap with downstate counties. Historical data show that \nchildren who enter care between the ages of birth through 3 years old in Cook County spend an \nexcessive amount to time in DCFS custody compared to similarly aged children who enter care \nin downstate counties. There is a 20 percentage-point gap in permanency outcomes between \nCook County and downstate counties, which emerges after three years since case opening. Even \nthough the gap narrowed during the mid-2000s due largely to a surge in adoptions of infants and \ntoddlers, the gap has widened again in recent years. \nBased on historical trends, the likelihood that this permanency gap can be closed by \nreunifying children with their birth family after the third year in foster care is extremely slim. \nLess than 6% of infants and toddlers reunify with their birth families after 36 months in care. \nThis is true for children in both Cook County and Downstate counties. The slim chances of \nreunification after an extended period of out-of-home care is borne out by over 50 years of \npermanency  planning  research.  Concurrent  planning  should  in  some  cases  continue,  but \npermanency goals must begin to shift toward adoption and guardianship by the end of a child’s \nthird year in care. Therefore, the IB3 quality improvement team will be offering support to the 10 \nintervention agencies that provide casework services to children enrolled in the IB3 program in \nan effort to improve engagement of relative caregivers and foster parents in IB3 services. \n65 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 69 of 88 PageID #:2125\n \nTo support further improvement in permanency outcomes, Dr. Steve Budde, Juvenile \nProtection Association, initiated a reunification viability review of cases with a special focus on \nfamilies who completed the parenting programs but have not received their children back into \ntheir custody. Supervisors have reported that the review has been helpful in support of case \nconceptualization and permanency planning. Three hundred cases will be used to test the new \nprotocol to assess the viability of alternative permanency options for children enrolled in the IB3 \ninterventions.   \nM.  Recommendation # 4:  SAFE Families for Children (SFC) \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The core objectives of SFC include deflection of youth \nfrom child welfare custody, child abuse prevention, and family support and stabilization. As \nnoted in the First Interim Triannual Report to the Court, the program cannot be evaluated until \nthere are a total of 475 families in the control group and 475 families in the comparison group. \nDue to low engagement, DCFS has reexamined and modified the process for engaging families \nin SFC so that the evaluation can be completed.  SFFC has been in place in northern Illinois for \nover ten years and was expanded statewide in October 2015, but even after that participation in \nthe program has lagged behind expectations. Implementation Plan, pp. 44-46.   \n2.  Status Report:   \nIn the last reporting period, DCFS committed to continue making individual contact with \nfamilies referred to the program in order to increase engagement and participation.  For the \nmonth of February, referrals were down to only 4 families (compared to 12 and 11, respectively, \nfor the prior months of December and November. But current projections are that referrals for \nMarch will match the earlier levels, but still are below the desired target of 20 new families per \nmonth. \n66 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 70 of 88 PageID #:2126\n \nDCFS has fixed one major implementation glitch that was discovered during the pilot \nevaluation  phase.    There  have  been  no  duplicate  assignments  of  cases  to  intervention  and \ncomparison groups since June of 2016. Unfortunately, the problem of identical cases being \nassigned  independently  by  DCFS  and  SFC  to  different  assignment  groups  has  not  been \nameliorated. DCFS attempted to solve the problem by giving “read-only” access of the SACWIS \nassignment screens to SFC. This appeared to solve one of the reasons for the cross-overs of cases \nfrom comparison to intervention conditions. SFC was able to stop accepting referrals from \nalready  assigned  cases by  checking  the  SACWIS  randomizer  in  advance. However, it was \ndiscovered that calls were being made to SFC prior to workers’ making the assignment in \nSACWIS.  As  a  result,  two  of  the  referrals  since  March  1,  2017  have  resulted  in  mixed \nassignments because DFCS workers completed the case assignment in SACWIS after the call \nwas made to SFC (which randomized the case on its own). In the hopes of eliminating the \n“dueling randomizers,” Mike Ruppe and Nora Harms-Pavelski met with one of the Expert Panel \nmembers in April to explore the possibility of allowing SFC access privilege to use the SACWIS \nrandomizer.  This  proved  to  be  too  drastic  a  departure  from  confidentiality  rules  so  DCFS \nproposed another potential solution. \nThe current plan in the works is that SFC will not activate its own randomizer when a call \nis made directly to them within the hours of 8 am to 4:30 pm.  Instead, a DCFS has identified a \nstaff person whom SFC can call during work hours who will have access privileges to activate \nthe randomizer.  After hours, the SF randomizer will still be available for use and will override \nany assignments made by DCFS.   \nAnother implementation problem has been the lack of follow-though on families assigned \nto the intervention group for whom DCFS has indicated in SACWIS that the family has agreed to \n67 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 71 of 88 PageID #:2127\n \nacceptingg SFC hostinng services. Since the ffiirst triannuaal report wass submitted, only one-haalf of \nthe famillies (50%) wwho agreed to hosting services weere put in coontact with SFC. DCFSS has \narranged for the Associate Depuuty for Childd Protection to be informmed of DCFS staff who were \nnot  respoonding  to SSafe  Familiees  inquiries regarding  tthe  status  oof  referred  families,  soo  that \nappropriaate action coould be takeen.  This proocess is in pplace and a ttracking mechanism is bbeing \ndevelopeed to track thhis information.  \nDDCFS also ccommitted tto have devveloped a mmethod for ttracking fammily engagemment, \nwhether to create a rreferral formm to assist wwith tracking, and whethher and how expansion oof the \nprogram will be needded to better serve childrren in the firrst four Immersion Sites..   \nRReferrals  forr  the  period  August  22014  througgh  Februaryy  2017  aree  shown  beelow: \n \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nItt is anticipated that if thee DCFS plann to centralizze the referrral and allocation processs can \nbe implemented, thatt the changee along with continued ooversight of DCFS staff’’s responsiveness \n68 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 72 of 88 PageID #:2128\n \nby the Associate Deputy for Child Protection and SFC’s continued practice of making individual \ncontact with families will boost family participation in SFC hosting services sufficient to meet or \nexceed the target of 60 families per quarter.   \nBy  the  end  of  the  next  reporting  period,  DCFS  will  either  have  implemented  the \nmodification of the referral / randomization process or will have developed and implemented \nalternative measures to increase participation in this program.  Further action clearly is required, \nas the current strategies have not resulted in a material improvement.  Since February 17, 2017, \nDCFS has only been able to restore the number of referrals from DCFS investigators to SFFC to \nits prior, inadequate volume of 11 families per month.  Exhibit P, SAFE Families Four Month \nStatus Report.  \nN.  Panel Recommendation # 4:  Information Systems \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe Implementation Plan requires DCFS to take a number of steps to enhance or replace \ndata systems to generate more timely, accurate and complete data.   \nShort  term  goals,  with  a  targeted  completion  between  March  and  September  2017, \ninclude enhancement of the existing SACWIS system to accept educational data provided by \nISBE and unusual incident reporting from private agencies, as well as improvements in mobile \ntechnology  through  a  mobile  application  for  caseworkers,  on-line  foster  parent  licensing \napplication, and a tablet application for licensing site inspections.  Implementation Plan, pp. 48-\n52. \nLong-term goals, with a targeted completion date of September 2019, are replacement of \nthe existing SACWIS system, and implementation of predictive analytics. Implementation Plan, \npp. 48-52.  Regarding predictive analytics, DCFS committed to establishing an internal team in \nOITS to bring reporting needs and data analytics into a centrally managed organization. In the \n69 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 73 of 88 PageID #:2129\n \nshort term, DCFS elected to use Mindshare as the platform for its data analytics.  This product \nallows DCFS to merge and analyze data from multiple environments and produce reports for \nmore informed decision making in a dashboard format.  Ultimately, DCFS intends to establish a \nstatewide enterprise data analytics platform (“Enterprise IT”) to reduce reliance on external \nentities  to  collect  and  analyze  data  to  drive  outcomes.  Implementation  Plan,  pp.  49-51.  \nAchievement of that goal is not anticipated until December 2018.   \n2.  Status Report:   \nReplacement of SACWIS:  Subsequent to the approval by U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services Administration for Children and Families of DCFS’ Planning Advance \nPlanning Document, DCFS issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a feasibility study to replace \nSACWIS with a “Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System.”  On March 16, 2017, a \nbidder’s conference was held.  On March 21, 2017, vendor questions were due and on March 27, \n2017, DCFS published responses to vendor questions.  The RFP closed on April 11, 2017 and \nDCFS is in the process of a two-phase scoring model.  DCFS remains on target for a July 1, 2017 \nstart date for the contract on the feasibility study.  Exhibit Q, Four Month Status Report, CCWIS \nRFP, p. 1.  However, DCFS’ current contract with an outside consulting group, Five Points, is set \nto expire on June 30, 2017.  Five Points has provided critical technical support and expertise \nDCFS needs to oversee and evaluate the feasibility study.  DCFS is currently evaluating various \noptions with respect to the consultants employed by Five Points in an attempt to ensure that this \ninitiative is not jeopardized. \nMindshare. The contract with Mindshare began in September 2015 and is in place \nthrough January 2018.  B.H. Implementation Plan.  At the present time, DCFS is exploring the \npossibility of developing a replacement for the Mindshare platform using POWERBI and MS  \n70 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 74 of 88 PageID #:2130\n \nSQL server engines in house.  DCFS recently hired a Victor O. Johnathan, MBA, PMP as its \nChief Information Officer, who will be involved in the exploration of the development of the \npossible replacement for the Mindshare platform. DCFS anticipates that a decision regarding the \nMindshare platform will be made within in the next reporting period and that a transition plan \nwill  be  developed  once  that  decision  is  made.    Plaintiffs  remain  concerned  regarding  the \nexpiration of the Mindshare contract, as set forth in their separate submission. \nShort Term Improvement of Existing SACWIS:  The Significant Event Report system \nwas launched on February 24, 2017 and provides automated functionality in SACWIS.  The \nSignificant Event Report system captures significant occurrences that impact child and youth \nserviced by DCFS. Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects, pp. 1-2.  Training of DCFS \nstaff and private agency staff has begun but is not yet complete.  \nIn the last reporting period, DCFS had regular contact with staff from the State Board of \nEducation to further explore how education data maintained by the Illinois State Board of \nEducation can be integrated into SACWIS.  Those discussions are ongoing.   To date, a solution \nfor performing that integration has not been finalized.  The remaining hurdle is developing a \nmeans for integration that does not require manual matching of records from ISBE.   \nMobile Applications:  On April 19, 2017, DCFS released version 2 of the Case Access \nmobile app.  Updates include a new and improved user interface, industry standard design, \nandroid  compatibility  and  auto-rotate  enhancement  for  keyboard  users  and  a  larger  photo \ndisplay.  Exhibit R, Announcement April 18, 2017, Mobile app version 2 to be released 4/19/17.   \nData reflects improvement in the timeliness of case note and photo data entry.  Data as of March \n31, 2017 show that the average baseline time for a child protection specialist to enter a case note \nin SACWIS was 7 days and the mobile app has decreased that time to one day; the average \n71 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 75 of 88 PageID #:2131\n \nbaseline time for a child welfare specialist to enter a case note in SACWIS was 14 days and the \nmobile app has decreased that time to half a day. Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report, IT \nProjects, pp. 4.   \nDCFS also created an on-line licensing application for foster homes.  A controlled roll-\nout of the licensing application commenced which includes DuPage, Bloomington, McLean, \nLivingston, Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford counties.  DCFS staff continue to work on the \ncontrolled roll-out of the licensing application and DCFS has received 38 online applications to \ndate.    Exhibit B, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects, pp. 4.   \nPredictive Analytics  \nThe predictive analytics project developed by Mindshare, which tracks information from \nnine areas of practice and analyses that data to identify investigations with the highest probability \nof serious injury for children aged 0 to 8 known to DCFS, is up and running.  DCFS anticipated \nthat a reporting mechanism would be built into the Eckerd / Mindshare portal to allow the \nsharing of data with DCFS Administration, Regions, and Teams.  That has not occurred..   \nDCFS has not yet decided whether to expand the predictive analytics model to intact \nfamily cases.  If that expansion occurs, DCFS anticipates that the work can be done with current \nEckerd staff within DCFS, and that the expansion could be available beginning in FY 18.    \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nReplacement of SACWIS.  DCFS has awarded the CCWIS Feasibility Study contract to \na vendor and the project work will commence on July 1 2017.  DCFS intended to receive support \nfrom an outside contractor, Five Points, to assist with the feasibility study.  The DCFS’s contract \nwith Five Points ends on June 30, 2017, and DCFS  will determine how to proceed.   \n72 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 76 of 88 PageID #:2132\n \nShort-Term  Improvement  of  Existing  SACWIS.      DCFS  has  implemented  the \nSignificant Event Report system into SACWIS.  This new system replaces the prior Unusual \nIncident Report system.  Training of DCFS and private agency staff began in the last reporting \nperiod and has been completed.  \nThe target completion date for the second short-term improvement of SACWIS – the \nintegration of ISBE data by October, 2017 – may not be met.  DCFS has determined that these \nrecords can be loaded based on a manual matching process.  In addition, critical technical \nexpertise and support for this project presently is being provided by outside consultants from \nFive Points.  As discussed above, DCFS’ contract with Five Points expires on June 30, 2017, and \nit may not be possible to renew that contract. \nMobile  App  for  Caseworkers  –  By  the  next  reporting  period,  DCFS  will  have \ndeveloped and implemented a plan for identifying caseworkers who are not using the mobile app \nand  for  providing  the  additional  support  those  caseworkers  need  to  adapt  to  this  changed \ntechnology.  In addition, DCFS will develop a process for evaluating whether supervisors’ \npractices should be modified as the new technology is routinely used in the field.  DCFS uses a \ncomputer application to monitor progress and other issues.   \nMobile App for Licensing.  Roll-out of the mobile app for licensing continues.  A \nschedule for the roll out will be completed in the next reporting period.   \nPredictive Analytics.  By the next reporting period, DCFS will determine whether the \npredictive analytics program will be expanded to include intact family services and will develop \na plan for any such expansion. The Mindshare contracts began in September 2015 and will be in \nplace until January 2018.  The Implementation Plan contemplated that Mindshare would provide \nshort term transitional assistance in developing dashboards to view key outcomes in real time.  \n73 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 77 of 88 PageID #:2133\n \nBefore expiration of the Mindshare contract, DCFS may be a in a position to bring this function \nin-house.  DCFS is considering that and other potential options. \nO.  Panel Recommendation #5: \nRestore funding for the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (ISCAW) \nthat uses standardized instruments and assessment scales. (Implementation Plan, p. 53). \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplated restoration of \nfunding for the ISCAW well-being study, which would be a point-in-time study of the  \nThe well-being study was to replicate most of the methods of the Illinois Child Well-\nBeing Year 3 launched in 2004, with additional new features including:  updated methods to \nenhance caseworker participation and increase caseworker response rates, and a brief measure of \nchild life satisfaction to enhance measurement of positive child well-being. Implementation Plan, \np. 53.  The report is projected for the second quarter of 2018.  \n2.  Status Report:  The Survey Research Laboratory of the University of Illinois at \nChicago is developing the protocol for the study and the Institutional Review Board application.  \nThe information in the protocol and application will include:  a description of all sampling \nprocedures, communication plans for contact and recruitment of participants, development of \nprocedures for study interviews, preparation of all instruments, descriptions of methods for \npreparation and protection of data files, descriptions of methods to provide for human subject \nprotections and plans for analysis and dissemination of study results.   \nThe protocol will be reviewed by the University of Illinois Chicago Institutional Review \nBoard on June 15, 2017.  An agreement was reached which provides that the University of \nIllinois Chicago Institutional Review Board will have primary review of the study protocol. \nIn addition to the above work, decisions were made regarding study participants.  The \nsample will include 500 to 600 children and youth will be drawn from youth in care on June 30, \n74 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 78 of 88 PageID #:2134\n \n2017.  The sample will include those children and youth in non-permanent substitute care \nplacements for a minimum of three months and will only include one youth and child per \ncaregiver.  Exhibit V, Four Month Status Report, ISCAW.   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  Data analysis is currently scheduled to commence in \nthe first quarter of FY2018 and occur from July to September 2017.  It is anticipated that the \nfinal report will be available during the third quarter of FY 2018.    \nP.  Panel Recommendation #6: \nDevelop and implement a new plan for monitoring residential and group home programs, \nutilizing external partners. (Implementation Plan at p. 53).   \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The goals set out in the Implementation Plan were for \nDCFS, with the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University, to develop a \nredesigned residential monitoring program, the goal of which is to increase the safety of youth \nplaced  at  residential  treatment  facilities  and  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  residential \nservices provided at the residential treatment facilities.  As described in the Implementation Plan, \nthe program called for development of regional multi-disciplinary monitoring teams that would \nassess residential programs’ effectiveness utilizing multiple data sources and inputs.  Residential \nmonitoring teams were to have been identified and training was to have begun by December \n2016.  Implementation Plan, Exhibit YY [Dkt. 531-51].   DCFS partnered with Northwestern \nUniversity and the University of Illinois at Chicago to develop an improved monitoring system – \nthe Therapeutic Residential Performance Management Initiative (TRPMI). Chapin Hall was \nselected as the evaluator for this initiative.  The TRPMI pilot is designed to enhance youth \ntreatment, progress and well-being as well as to effectively monitor, evaluate and promote \ntherapeutic residential program effectiveness.   \n75 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 79 of 88 PageID #:2135\n \n2.  Status  Report:   A  comprehensive  plan  for  the  Therapeutic  Residential \nPerformance Management Initiative (TRPMI) was developed. Exhibit S, Summary:  Develop \nand Implement a New Plan for Monitoring Residential and Group Home Programs, dated April \n30, 2017;  Exhibit T, DCFS TRPMI Logic Model (updated 3/30/17) and Outcomes Table \n(updated 3/2/2017). \nThe Three Pilot Teams.  The TRPMI pilot calls for three TRPMI teams. Two TRPMI \nteams were implemented on January 9, 2017. The first team is responsible for monitoring 11 \nprogram groups (made up of 34 programs from five residential treatment providers located in the \nNorthern Region.  The second team is responsible for monitoring nine program groups (made up \nof 19 programs from seven residential treatment programs) located in the Southern Region.  The \nlast TRPMI pilot team, which is for Cook County, was implemented as of March 1, 2017, 30 \ndays ahead of schedule.  This team is responsible for monitoring six program groups (made up of \nsix programs from five residential treatment providers.  With implementation of this team, the \nTRPMI pilot will be monitoring service provision to nearly half of youth in residential treatment \nprograms in Illinois. \nStaffing.  As implementation of TRPMI proceeds, DCFS has concluded that current team \ncomposition may be inadequate to address the full scope of the work, especially with respect to \nthe activities associated with individualized and intensive discharge planning. Consequently, \nearly indications are that TRPMI teams are overextended and some of the traditional monitoring \nactivities focusing on agency compliance issues and effectiveness require greater attention.  The \nTRPMI Steering Committee has agreed that a third Clinical Specialist should be added to the \nCook TRPMI Team.   \n76 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 80 of 88 PageID #:2136\n \nNone of the three TRPMI teams are fully staffed.  A total of six Clinical Specialist \npositions are vacant (two FTE per team). Additional vacant positions include 1.5 CQI Specialist \npositions (.50 FTE per team) and one statewide QI Specialist.  A variety of full time and part-\ntime temporary staff who are “borrowed” primarily from the DCFS Clinical Division are in  \nplace on the Southern TRPMI team and the Northern TRPMI team to function as Clinical \nSpecialists while the permanent staff are being hired.   There are approximately five temporary \nFTEs (consisting of eight individuals).   \nStep-Down  and  TRPMI  Involvement  in  CFTs.    One  of  the  goals  of  the  TRPMI \nprogram is to identify youth who are ready or approaching readiness for stepdown, to improve \nstep-down  decision-making  and  planning,  and  to  assist  in  securing  appropriate  step-down \nplacements.  To complete these functions, TRPMI staff typically collaborate with the youth and \nrelevant  stakeholders  (including  case  management,  residential  and  immersion  site  staff) \nindividually and in the context of staffings to complete comprehensive planning \nAnother goal of the TRPMI pilot is to promote the development of CFTMs to replace the \nstaffing process as the driver of discharge planning. Because few CFTMS have been convened to \ndate for youth with the completed CASIIs (i.e., priority youth), TRPMI staff encourage treatment \nteams  to  start  taking  small  steps  toward  identifying  potential  CFTM  members to  assist  in \n \nexpediting  and  convening  the  CFTMs.    To  support  these  efforts,  a  draft  Communication \nProtocol/Procedure was developed on February 22, 2017, and was tested in March, 2017.  The \nCommunication  Protocol  is  intended  to  provide  a  means  of  effectively  communicating, \ncoordinating, collaborating and problem-solving within CFTMs to promote effective and timely \ntransition and discharge planning.  The protocol was tested with four Choices youth current \nplaced in TRPMI residential programs (during the end of March and early April) and whose \n77 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 81 of 88 PageID #:2137\n \nteams  were  not  in  consensus  regarding  critical  discharge  planning  decisions.    Debriefing \noccurred with the CHOICES and TRPMI teams and both provided positive feedback regarding \nthe use of the Communication Protocol.  TRPMI will continue to follow the youth to assess \neffectiveness of the protocol. DCFS has decided to roll out the protocol, and a roll-out plan is \nunder development for the three pilot sites.  \nTRPMI intends to eventually develop processes to monitor youth stability and wellbeing \npost-discharge to confirm the effectiveness of the discharge planning process.  \nTRPMI teams completed 61 CASIIs through March 2017 and anticipated an additional \n33 would be completed in April 2017 for a total of 94 CASIIs.  Targets have been established for \ncompleted CASIIs in May and June 2017.  \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nStaffing.    Permanent  positions  for  six  full-time  clinical  specialists,  one  quality \nimprovement specialist, and one statewide quality improvement manager have been approved \nand posted at Northwestern University.  Hiring is anticipated by June 30, 2017.  Once these \npositions are filled, all teams will be fully staffed according to the original staffing design.   \nNow that the hiring process is well underway, an overall evaluation of staffing resources \nwill be completed based on lessons learned during the initial implementation period.  The third \nClinical Specialist that was approved by the Steering Committee for the Cook County team will \nbe included in the evaluation.  It is anticipated that any revision to the staffing planning based on \nthe resource evaluation will require approval by DCFS.   The TRPMI team will complete the \nevaluation and present a plan to DCFS by July 1, 2017.  \nStep-Down and TRPMI Involvement in CFTs.  In this reporting period, in addition to \nimplementation of the Communication Protocol, more focused efforts to schedule and convene \n78 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 82 of 88 PageID #:2138\n \nCFTMs will be initiated. There may be multiple reasons why CFTMs are not currently being \nconvened more frequently, if at all. TRPMI staff and residential teams are now partnering with \nCIPP staff, which facilitate the CFTMS to increase the number of CFTMs being convened.  This \nwill include partnering with the CIPP program to assign facilitators who will assist in planning \nand facilitating the initial CFTM and a limited number of subsequent CFT meetings.  This \npartnership will be tested in May 2017 with a small number of youth who require development \nof CFTMs.  \nDashboard.    The  TRPMI  SharePoint  team  is  working  on  a  CASII  data  collection \nfunction  for  release  in  early  June  2017.    A  CASII  status  dashboard  and  a  CASII \nrecommendations data collection function are currently under development and are expected to \nbe delivered in early July 2017.  \nAnother  dashboard  showing  Congregate  Care  youth  information  is  currently  being \ndesigned in collaboration with the DCFS OITS team using the Mindshare application.  \nProgram Evaluation.  At the suggestion of the BH experts, the critical program outputs8 \nthat presently are being tracked and monitored will be refined so that the tracking process is \nmore manageable.  To ensure fidelity to the TRPMI program design is maintained, however, \nsome [output metrics will be reclassified and treated as process indicators.9 \nThe plan for evaluating TRPMI is in the process of being modified.  The initial plan for \nevaluating the TRPMI pilot was to use a cross-sectional pre-test / post-test design with calendar \nyear 2016 (CY16) defined as the baseline year (pre-test) and calendar year 2018 (CY18) defined \nas the post-test year.  Due to the changes in monitoring residential facilities, the feasibility of \n                                                 \n8 A program output is the product or deliverable produced by a program activity.  \n9 A process indicator is the unit of service or program activities delivered.  \n \n \n79 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 83 of 88 PageID #:2139\n \nadopting an interrupted time series design is being explored.  Interrupted time series designs are \ncommonly used to examine change in outcomes during a period of time preceding a program or \npolicy change and a similar period of time after such a change.  Adopting this design will allow \nevaluators  to  better  control  for  changes  over  time  that  are  independent  of  the  TRPMI \nintervention.  It will also allow more flexibility in defining a baseline time point or points, which \nshould allow the evaluation design to more accurately reflect the implementation milestones (i.e. \nhiring of full time clinical staff).  The Expert Panel supports this change in evaluation design.     \nOnce the Interrupted Time Series design is fully adopted by the pilot leadership, Chapin \nHall will provide data regarding the effectiveness of the pilots – accounting for implementation \nmilestones that may impact outcomes – on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Upon \nsuccessful completion of the pilots, the TRPMI strategies will be used to build the internal \ncapacity of DCFS staff to effectively monitor the safety, well-being and permanency of youth \nreceiving  residential  treatment.  The  TRPMI  monitoring  model  will  then  be  implemented \nstatewide.  \nA  time  frame  for  rollout  of  the  pilot  statewide  remains  uncertain  at  this  time.    A \ntimeframe will be developed based on the development of DCFS’ internal capacity to monitor \nresidential programs, either independently or in partnership with outside specialists.   \nIV.  Communication Plan:  Implement a Defined Communication Plan with the B.H. \nExpert Panel and Plaintiffs’ attorneys.  (Implementation Plan, p. 55). \n1.  Progress Goals / Target:  A Communication Plan, entered by the Court on \nSeptember 28, 2016 [Dkt. 530], provides for bi-weekly conferences with the Expert Panel and \nthe Parties, during which the pilots and programs identified in the Implementation Plan are \ndiscussed.  The plan provides for DCFS to provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel which details the specific steps that have been taken in actual implementation \n80 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 84 of 88 PageID #:2140\n \nof each initiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers \nthat exist and strategies to eliminate or resolve the barriers, and an evaluation of program results.  \nThe Plan also provides for DCFS to make efforts proactively to share information “beyond that \nwhich directly relates to the specific initiatives described in the Implementation Plan” that \nnevertheless is significant.   \nAdditionally, DCFS staff participate in quarterly meetings with the Office of the Cook \nCounty Public Guardians office.  A DCFS representative with knowledge of the status of the \nB.H.  Implementation  Plan  will  attend  those  meetings  to  address  issues  with  the  B.H. \nImplementation Plan and status updates.   The next quarterly meeting is scheduled for June 14, \n2017.  \n2.  Status Report:  During this reporting period, all required telephone conferences \nand meetings have been held. DCFS is of the view that there are no communications issues.  \nPlaintiffs disagree.  In their view, though communication has improved, communication issues \ncontinue to arise.   \nFirst,  there  continue  to  be  instances  in  which  the  Experts  have  flagged  a  potential \nproblem or issue and have asked questions, but have not received timely response (or any \nresponse at all) to those inquiries.   \nFurther, in Plaintiffs’ view, DCFS (i) has shown a growing tendency to use the improved \nlevel of communication with the Experts as a means to relinquish decision-making to the Experts \nin the first instance; (ii) DCFS has failed to acknowledge developing problems in a timely \nmanner and only discloses those issues when they have reached crisis proportion; and (iii) \ninformation DCFS has provided in recent meetings regarding the failures in the investigation \nprocess, a new (and untested) program for accelerating investigation closures, and investigator \n81 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 85 of 88 PageID #:2141\n \ncaseloads was, at best, materially incomplete.  Plaintiffs’ views on these issues are set forth more \nfully in their Additional Submission, which is filed contemporaneously herewith.   \nRevised  Targets  /  Goals:   DCFS  will  continue  in  its  efforts  to  comply  with  all \nrequirements of the Communication Plan.   \nV.  Project for a Target Group of Children and Youth/Enhanced IPS Program Beyond \nMedical Necessity Pilot \n1.  Progress Goals / Target \nIn the September 28, 2016 Implementation Plan, DCFS committed to a pilot targeted to \nserve fifty (50) children and youth from Cook County who are in psychiatric hospitals beyond \nmedical necessity (BMN). Fifty (50) youth were to be served, and 100 youth were to be used for \ntwo comparison groups of 50 youths each.  \nAs of September, 2016, when the Court entered the Implementation Plan, the logic model \nfor this pilot had not been refined.  \nThe BMN pilot was scheduled to begin in September 2016 with a review of five cases \nand scheduled to be operational in November 2016.  Amended and Revised Implementation \nPlan, pp. 56-57. \n2.  Status Report:   \nContract Modification and Hiring.  In the last reporting period, DCFS committed to \namendment of its current contract with Kaleidoscope for intensive stabilization services.  The \namendment  was  to  allow  Kaleidoscope  to  hire  additional  staff,  including  positions  for \nStabilization Consultants.  The position was posted in January 2017. Initially, there were very \nfew candidates due to the requirement of a master’s level degree, child welfare experience and \nthe salary range.  DCFS agreed to increase the salary range.  On May 14, 2017, the first \nStabilization  Consultant  began  employment  at  Kaleidoscope.    Interviews  for  the  second \n82 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 86 of 88 PageID #:2142\n \nStabilization Consultant position are ongoing.  Exhibit U, Four Month Status Report, Target \nGroup of Children and Youth in Psychiatric Hospitals beyond Medical Necessity Pilot, p. 1.   \nChildren Served.  It previously was agreed that until Stabilization Consultants were \nretained, no more than three youth would be served through the pilot.10  As those positions are \nfilled, additional youth will be served.  It was anticipated that by April 30, 2017, at least five new \nyouth would be assigned to the pilot.  The goal regarding the number of children to be served in \nthis project has not yet been determined and is dependent on the completion of the hiring \nprocess.   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals \nContract  Modification  and  Hiring.    Kaleidoscope  intends  to  add  a  Stabilization \nConsultant for every 5 to 8 children added to the pilot.   The target is to hire two additional \nPlacement Stabilization Consultants in FY 2018 and potentially to add two additional Placement \nStabilization Consultants in the future.  The Stabilization Consultants must receive training in the \nChild and Family Team process.   \nChildren Served.  The goal regarding the number of children to be served in this project \nhas not yet been determined and is dependent on the completion of the hiring process.  The \ncurrent goal is for five to ten youth to be assigned to every Placement Stabilization Consultant \nwho is hired.  The three current youth in care are transitioning to the newly hired Placement \n                                                 \n10There are three youth assigned to the pilot.  The first youth was initially recommended for a \nresidential placement, but a home-based setting with the previous foster parent’s adult sisters was \nlocated.  Despite the work of the Kaleidoscope, the youth has been re-hospitalized twice since \nKaleidoscope’s involvement.  Kaleidoscope continues to work very closely with the family \nensuring that all needed supports are in place.  A second youth has done well since his discharge \nfrom the psychiatric hospital.  Due to his stability and successful service delivery, Kaleidoscope \nis no longer servicing this case.  The third youth was placed in a relative home from the \npsychiatric hospital.  There was a change in the child welfare specialist assigned to the case after \nthe hospitalization.  Exhibit U, Four Month Status Report, Target Group of Children and Youth \nin Psychiatric Hospitals beyond Medical Necessity Pilot, p. 1.     \n83 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 87 of 88 PageID #:2143\n \nStabilization Consultant and she will be assigned an additional two to seven youth.  With the two \nadditional hires, ten to 20 youth will be assigned to this pilot.  \nProgram Enhancement.  DCFS is enhancing processes under the pilot.  Kaleidoscope \nwill  be  invited  to  CIPP  staffings  in  Cook  County  for  all  youth  who  are  psychiatrically \nhospitalized to allow intervention to occur as soon as possible and Kaleidoscope will attend their \nfirst  CIPP  on  June  5,  2017.  Participation  in  the  CIPPs  will  be  randomized.   At  this  time, \nparticipation occurs when a CIPP occurs on a particular day (randomized) with the youth’s \nidentification  number  ending  with  an  odd  number.   DCFS  is  using  the  month  of  June  to \ndetermine if this is a good process to determine the amount of youth eligible for this pilot.  If the \nfuture research shows that Kaleidoscope’s participation in the staffing and service delivery \nsupports the pilot’s Theory of Change, then the intent would be to expand the program to include \nmost (or all) CIPPs.  DCFS anticipates having all necessary research regarding the pilot by \nDecember 2017.   \nAs of March 3, 2017, DCFS will also enhance board payments for the caregivers as \nneeded while receiving case management from an agency that does not have a specialized \ncontract.  Exhibit  U,  Four  Month  Status  Report,  Target  Group  of  Children  and  Youth  in \nPsychiatric Hospitals beyond Medical Necessity Pilot.  DCFS will be able to back date this rate \nto the relative caregivers that were already involved in the pilot to the date of placement.   \nFinally, control and comparison groups have been better defined.  Assignment to the pilot \nwill be random and will be determined according to the last digit of the youth’s DCFS ID \nnumber and the day that the youth’s CIPP occurs.   Kaleidoscope is scheduled to attend its first \nCIPP on June 5, 2017.  Chapin Hall, Kaleidoscope and DCFS representatives have agreed that \nthe control and comparison group will be formalized with a July 1, 2017 date to ensure that the \n84 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 543 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 88 of 88 PageID #:2144\n \nidentified assignment will reflect a good portion of youth that Kaleidoscope will be able to \nprovide services for.  \nDashboard.  The dashboard in the Mindshare platform has not yet been finalized.  That \nwill occur during the next reporting period. The additional time was necessary for DCFS to \nbetter define the pilot.  Chapin Hall’s involvement has also assisted in better defining outcomes.   \n  Pilot Completion and Evaluation.   At this time, DCFS anticipates that the pilot will be \nin effect until the end of fiscal year 2019 (June 30, 2019).  The formal evaluators for this project \nare still not identified however Chapin Hall is currently being explored as an option.  DCFS will \nhave the evaluator identified by the next reporting period.  \n \n \n \n \n \n85 ",

      "text": "Case: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 1 of 59 PageID #:2639\n \nOctober 27, 2017 \nThe Honorable Jorge L. Alonso \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois \n219 S Dearborn Street  \nChicago, IL 60604 \n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 \n \nDear Judge Alonso: \nIntroduction \nIt has been a year since this court approved the B.H. Implementation Plan. The Plan included \nprovision for the parties and the Expert Panel to regularly review progress on the Plan’s objectives and \ninitiatives, and then to submit a collaboratively prepared and agreed-upon triannual status report to the \nCourt. Despite several extensions for filing, the Department was unable to prepare the complete draft \nThird Triannual Report with sufficient time to allow the Expert Panel to review and meaningfully \ncomment on the Department’s report prior to its required submission.  \nRegarding those sections of the Department’s report that we received and reviewed by October \n25, 2017, we did not have significant disagreement with the technical accuracy of the specific data the \nDepartment reported for the different initiatives. We were more concerned that the Department provided \nlimited analysis and interpretation of the reasons when the outputs and outcomes for various initiatives \nfailed to meet expected targets. Further, the Department did not accurately reflect the scope and \ncomplexity of certain individual initiatives themselves, the challenges already encountered at the current \nphase of implementation, or the recognition that successful implementation of any one of the initiatives is \ninextricably linked to successful implementation of other initiatives. Finally, the Department’s reports \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 2 of 59 PageID #:2640\nand actions to date do not reflect that it has an integrated process or plan to address together the inter-\nrelated challenges that are preventing class members from receiving the services they need and from \nsecuring the safety, permanence and well-being to which they are entitled.  This is the basis of our \njudgment, discussed below, that the Department needs additional assistance in the use of implementation \nscience principles and practices.  \nDespite the foregoing, through our regular meetings with DCFS leadership and Project Directors, \nthe Expert Panel believes it has sufficient information to provide this independent report, which gives the \nExpert Panel’s perspective on the current status of B.H. implementation and offers recommendations for \nspecific actions we believe are needed at this critical juncture.   \nIn the first 4 pages of this letter, we offer a brief summary of our general views regarding the \nstatus of the Department’s implementation efforts.  At pages 4 – 5, we offer several recommendations for \nimmediate action by the Department that require the involvement of entities outside the Department.  The \nremainder of this letter includes the Expert Panel’s detailed discussion of the Department’s \nimplementation efforts and recommendations for additional, specific action by the Department.   \nBrief Summary of Status of B.H. Implementation \nDuring the year since the Court approved the Implementation Plan, the Department has made \nprogress in achieving several goals included therein. The Department has acted upon needed \nimprovements in the integrity of implementation and rigor of evaluation.  Some child service programs \nare showing promise.  And we now have enough preliminary evidence to conclude that some of the other \ninitiatives are unlikely to meet their objectives and should be discontinued or replaced once the parties \nand the Expert Panel agree on the criteria and process for making a decision about these initiatives and \nothers in the future.  \nThe progress achieved with some initiatives contrasts with the floundering we have observed with \nother initiatives that make up key elements of the B.H. Implementation Plan.  The Department’s \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 3 of 59 PageID #:2641\nimplementation efforts for the Immersion Sites and the Department’s Core Practice Model are stalled.  \nThe Department is struggling to implement effective child and family teams for case planning, to develop \nenhanced and expanded community-based service arrays.  Also stalled are the Department’s efforts to roll \nout quality improvement policies and practices necessary to support quality service delivery, to identify \nand improve system design, and to address service delivery challenges related to individual youth in care, \nto the residential programs that serve them, and to the overall system of care which the Department \nmanages. Taken together, these floundering initiatives form the very core of the overall reform required in \nB.H.:  for the Department to create and maintain a system of services that provides for the safety, \npermanence and well-being of class members, including services that address their medical, behavioral \nhealth and developmental needs in settings that are as homelike as their needs permit.  \nThe B.H. Implementation Plan calls for the Department to roll-out a functioning statewide system \nof services by adhering to the principles of implementation science through a “staged ‘immersion’ process \nof retraining and coaching front-line staff in a cohesive model of practice that provides children and their \nfamilies with access to a comprehensive array of services, including intensive home-based services, \ndesigned to enable children to live with their families.”1 The Expert Panel acknowledges that “[w]hat \nDCFS and the State of Illinois are undertaking is exceptionally ambitious and will require an intensity of \nfocus to execute. Breaking down organizational silos of activity and responsibility, changing ingrained \ncultural habits, managing more than a thousand private contracts, and instituting new models of care with \nminimal negative impact on children in care is an extraordinary task.”2  The B.H. Implementation Plan \nthus anticipated that the parties would periodically review the progress made and negotiate appropriate \nrevisions in the Plan once actionable evidence became available. This is a process that Sabel and Simon \n(2004) refer to as a rolling-rule regime, in which initiatives are considered provisional, are reviewed \nperiodically, and are confirmed or revised with continuous stakeholder participation. The process is one \n                                                           \n1 Amended and Revised DCFS B.H. Implementation Plan, September 15, 2016, p. 25. \n2 B.H. v Sheldon 88 C 5599 Defendant’s Submission Supplement to DCFS Implementation Plan, p. 2. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 4 of 59 PageID #:2642\ncomponent of the “experimentalist” approach to consent decree management.  Other components include: \nnegotiation in which decisions are based on persuasion and evidence rather than fiat; and transparency in \nwhich the parties commit to outcome measures that are relatively specific and to methods of rigorous \nevaluation that facilitate disciplined comparisons to past performance, similar units, and whenever \npossible, randomized control groups. These three concepts guided the development of the B.H. \nImplementation Plan. They form the principles that must guide the ongoing review and revisions of the \nplan. \nWe find ourselves at a critical juncture with respect to the Department’s readiness and willingness \nto continue to abide by the principles of rolling-rule regimes, negotiation, and transparency. Once again, \nthe Department has experienced an unanticipated change in leadership. Past leadership changes have \ncontributed to difficulties the Department has had achieving objectives of the Consent Decree. Any \nleadership transition poses challenges to maintaining the consistency of vision and on-going \ncommitments to past institutional assurances.  Without sustained reinforcement and additional support for \nthe experimentalist approach from the new DCFS leadership – which to date has been lacking – we \nbelieve the Department is in danger of losing the advances already made, and that any further progress on \nkey initiatives within the Implementation Plan and requirements of the consent decree will be stymied \naltogether. \nSpecific Recommendations for Immediate Action Involving Outside Entities \nThroughout this letter, the Expert Panel makes specific recommendations about actions we \nbelieve the Department must take now if it is to fulfill its obligations under the current Implementation \nPlan and preserving what progress it has made to date thereunder. Our recommendations are based on the \nstatus reports of the Department’s B.H. initiatives; regular meetings with the parties, with Department \nstaff, the Department’s university and evaluation partners, and other external stakeholders; and the \nPanel’s own review and analysis of relevant information concerning the Department’s B.H. initiatives \ncontained in this report. We have discussed our concerns and the bases for our recommendations with the \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 5 of 59 PageID #:2643\nparties; therefore, we are hopeful that the parties agree with the recommendations, and that together, we \ncan agree on specific steps the Department will take and timeframes for those actions.  In addition, the \nExpert Panel makes the following recommendations involving participants outside the Department: \n1.  The Department will substantially expand the involvement of NIRN in the \nimplementation efforts underway in and for the Immersion Sites in order to improve the \nchances of success.  NIRN’s involvement should include focus on implementation of the \nDepartment’s Core Practice Model, particularly the training and coaching necessary to \nimbed effective child and family teams in casework practice and to implement the needed \nexpanded array of intensive home and community-based services. \n2.  The Department will act on the recommendations of the Child Welfare Policy and \nPractice Group (of October 16, 2017) to strengthen implementation and to address \nchallenges and obstacles to implementation in the Immersion Sites. \n3.  The Department will develop, in consultation with the Expert Panel, plaintiffs and its \nexternal partners, UIC, Northwestern, and Chapin Hall, the criteria and process it will use \nto determine and implement the types of new and expanded services and supports needed \nby youth in care with particularly complex behavioral health needs (e.g., “stuck” kids, \nyouth with significant mental health and developmental needs often accompanied by \naggressive behavior, youth with severe needs on the autistic spectrum, and youth who \nexhibit particularly dangerous and/or self-destructive behavior).     \n4.  The Department will identify and define the behavioral health services most needed by \nDCFS youth that should be included in the IDHFS – Medicaid-funded MCO contract. In \naddition, the Department (again in consultation with the Expert Panel, plaintiffs, and \nother relevant stakeholders) will actively engage in planning with IDHFS to develop the \nMCO contract. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 6 of 59 PageID #:2644\nGiven the intense level of activity that will be required under the Decree for the foreseeable \nfuture, the Expert Panel had planned to submit a separate request to augment its staffing and consultation \nsupport through the Children and Family Research Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign.  That request, as outlined in this report and in separate correspondence to the Department, \nwas made so that the Expert Panel can fulfill its independent responsibility to review and report on the \nDepartment’s progress toward meeting the needs of the plaintiff class. Immediately prior to submitting \nthis letter, the Department’s counsel informed us that the Department expects to agree to our request. If \nwe do not reach agreement, we will then submit our request to the Court. \nDETAILED REPORT AND ANALYSIS \nIssues with Adherence to the Experimentalist Approach \n   We are pleased to report that where the Department has followed the experimentalist approach in \nits implementation efforts, that investment is beginning to bear fruit, particularly for those initiatives \nwhere the Department also adhered to the principles of \nimplementation science. For example, the Illinois birth thru \nthree (IB3) demonstration, which offers child-parent therapy \nor other trauma-informed parenting support to the \ncaregivers and parents of children who have been taken into \nstate custody before their third birthday, is finally showing \npositive results. The Department enrolled 1,606 babies in \nthe demonstration from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. \nAmong the one-half of children assigned to the 10 agencies that offer the program, they experienced a \n47% faster rate of reunification with parents or permanent guardianship with their extended family \n(family unification) than the one-half of children assigned to the 10 agencies that conduct “business as \nusual.” As illustrated in the Figure above, this improvement is discernible only after these babies have \nspent in excess of 800 days in foster care. While the Expert Panel believes no child should spend these \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 7 of 59 PageID #:2645\ncritical developmental years in foster care, the progress that the program has made in expediting the \ndischarge of these infants and toddlers from long-term foster care to permanent family arrangements is \npositive. \nThe Expert Panel is reasonably confident that the permanency improvements shown in the \ninitiative are attributable to the IB3 program specifically because families were allocated to the \nintervention and comparison agencies in an unbiased manner using the Department’s rotational \nassignment system. Rotational assignment delinks the offer of treatment from individual characteristics \nand prognostic factors that put infants and toddlers at differential risk of long-term foster care (e.g. \ninadequacy of pre-natal care, in utero substance exposure, maternal unavailability at birth, and severity of \ntraumatic grief symptoms). Rotational assignment helps to ensure that the intervention and comparison \ngroups look similar, on average, at the start. Therefore, if differences in outcomes subsequently emerge, \nwe can be reasonably confident that the differences are attributable to the intervention rather than to \npreexisting differences at baseline (selection), changes that would have occurred in any event \n(maturation), and other happenings that unfold over time (history). The improvements in reunification \nappear to flow directly through completion of IB3 services by parents as well as indirectly through \nchanges in agency culture (i.e., they become more family friendly). We believe that planning for rolling-\nout these interventions beyond Cook County should start now given this preliminary evidence of the \nprogram’s efficacy. Nonetheless, it will be important to track outcomes for another year to ensure that the \nprogram is rolled out and executed with fidelity to its design, and that the differences remain positive with \nrespect to re-entry rates and repeat maltreatment. We also anticipate that more adoptions will make-up for \nfewer reunifications in the comparison group, which may eventually eliminate any overall permanency \ndifferences between the intervention and comparison groups.  \nThe ease of interpretation and clarity about future planning, which stems from taking an \nexperimentalist approach to consent decree management, can be contrasted with the frustration, lack of \nclarity, and lack of progress that results when the Department undertakes initiatives without design and \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 8 of 59 PageID #:2646\nimplementation discipline, and reverts to its “business as usual” approach to management. For example, \nthe Expert Panel requested over a year ago that the Department conduct a retrospective assessment of the \n“one-shot” initiative that the Department undertook in December of 2015 to dramatically reduce the \nnumber of youth “stuck” in and ready to step down from residential treatment programs. We were told \nthat the effort focused on 569 youth who were in institutional care. The Panel asked for more information \nabout where they landed, how stable the placements were, how many had run from home, been arrested, \nor dropped out of school. We were a little surprised that the agency didn’t have this information at its \nfingertips as a matter of sound management practice. DCFS subsequently commissioned Chapin Hall at \nthe University of Chicago to conduct a retrospective assessment. Because there was no comparison group \nfor assessing differences in what might have happened in the absence of the special initiative, Chapin Hall \ndid its best to piece together a matched sample of cases. Chapin Hall gave an oral briefing on the updated \nfindings in September 2017 in response to our questions. Of the 569 youth included in the initiative: 81 \nwere dropped from the assessment because they had not been in residential care for 12 months or more as \nof February 23, 2015; 33 remained at the target residential center as of April 30, 2017 and 21 exited care \ndirectly, leaving 434 youth in the target group. Of the 434 youth in the eventual focus group for follow-\nup, 191 youth made lateral moves to other residential treatment programs or other placements, meaning \nthat 57% (326 youth) of the original 569 youth in residential programs either remained in the facility, \nwere transferred to other similarly restrictive residential programs, or exited directly from residential care. \nOf the original 569 youth, 243 (43%) stepped down (or exited care directly) to less restrictive settings.  In \nother words, a tremendous amount of activity took place, but no one knows whether the children involved \nare better off, not better off, or worse off than before as a result. \nWe recently received the full report addressing the questions we had posed. Based on the oral \nbriefing we received, it appears that the differences in outcomes between the intervention group and the \nmatched sample of cases were minimal, which in a sense is good news. At least the special effort did not \nresult in inappropriate discharges for the 43% of the original focus group who stepped down. On the other \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 9 of 59 PageID #:2647\nhand, we do not really know what to make of the results. Are the groups truly comparable? What lessons \ncan be generalized from the initiative for future application? What did the Department learn about the \nbehavioral health and other needs of the 326 youth (57% of the original 569 youth) who remained in \nrestrictive residential settings and were not stepped down to home or community-based settings? Instead \nof a one-shot initiative, if the Department had instead adopted an experimentalist approach and limited the \ninitiative to a random half of the 567 youth, we would have been in a much better position to track in real \ntime the emerging differences or lack thereof. Based on the evidence, the Department would be able to \ndecide with greater confidence whether the effort should be continued, extended, or stopped because of \nunfavorable results.  \nRequiring that the Department adhere to its promise to operate based on evidence is of critical \nimportance.  We bring this to the attention of the Court because the Department, with the new Acting \nDirector’s arrival, now appears to be diverging from the experimentalist approach it originally applied \nwhen implementing and evaluating many of the pilot initiatives in the Implementation Plan. These \ninclude the Core Practice Model through the Immersion Sites and IB3, Safe Families for Children, Pay \nfor Success, Beyond Medical Necessity, and Regenerations, among others.  For example, we learned in \nJuly of 2017 that without prior consultation with the Expert Panel the Department was planning to initiate \nanother one-shot clinical review and stepped up discharge planning for youth who have been designated \nas clinically ready for discharge. The Department then expanded its review and step-down planning to \ninclude other so-called “stuck” youth in hospitals, detention facilities, or short-term emergency \nplacements, youth who frequently have even more complex treatment and support needs than those in \nneed of discharge plans and services to leave residential programs. While this “take-charge” attitude may \nsound desirable, the sad reality is that most of these youth are in need of highly specialized community-\nbased services, especially mental health treatment, which simply don’t exist in the communities to which \nthey will be discharged.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 10 of 59 PageID #:2648\nOne of the purposes of the Immersion Sites is to make certain that the appropriate plans and \nneeded services are in place before stepping youth down to less restrictive settings.  We asked the \nDepartment how a new “step-down” planning initiative focused on youth “stuck” in residential programs \nwould fit with the broader work underway in Immersion Sites to implement the Core Practice Model and \neffective child and family teams with all members of the plaintiff class. The Department decided to focus \non youth in residential or other high-end settings who were not from Immersion Sites (identifying 10 \npriority youth from each of the four existing administrative regions in the state). This, despite the fact that \nthe DCFS and provider case worker staff who will be assigned case management responsibility to develop \nand implement discharge and service plans for these youth have not yet received coaching, training and \nmentoring in how to apply the Department’s Core Practice Model through meaningful engagement with \nfamilies and effective child and family teams.  That looks and feels like an abandonment of both the \nImmersion Site initiative and the Core Practice Model that the Department has pledged to adopt.  And it \nis potentially dangerous for youth. \nCaseworkers, supervisors and other departmental regional administrative staff assigned \nresponsibility for these youth are being asked to undertake planning and service implementation activities \nfor youth with some of the most challenging behavioral health needs in the context of communities where \nthe specialized treatment services many of them need either do not exist at all or have not been \nsuccessfully individualized in the past to address similar youths’ needs. Dr. Testa wrote to Mr. Digre, \n“[w]e understand the Department’s desire to increase the outputs from all of the B.H. projects including \nthe perceived need to do something quickly in the hopes that it disrupts the system-wide stasis we have \nbeen observing over the last decade. However, we've been down this road before with little tangible \nevidence of whether these initiatives truly worked and improved the situations for children…. So let's \nmake sure we're not simply ’flailing’ about and instead make sure we walk away with tangible evidence \nof how the process worked, to what effect, and what inferences can be drawn about how the lives of \nchildren have improved as a result of the initiative.”  (Email to Pete Digre on July 27, 2017)  Past \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 11 of 59 PageID #:2649\nexperience has shown that the staff, time and other resources devoted to finding placements for these \nyouth may not result in sustained improvement even for the targeted youth, and certainly will not result in \nthe systemic or sustainable change to the DCFS system that is needed to help the next group of 300 youth \nwho need community-based services and supports. \nThe Department’s focus on the current group of “stuck” youth appears to assume that the services \nand supports these youth need actually exist, are available and are equipped to meet their needs, if only \nthere were a centrally managed effort orchestrated to “match” youth with vacant “beds” in the community \nand direct assigned case workers to take the necessary steps to effect the match and placement.  That \nassumption is not based on evidence.  These initiatives have been tried many times before, and outside of \nthe Immersion Sites, the necessary changes in the structure, organization and allocation of resources are \nnot available to provide what these and other youth will need in the near and longer term future. \nThe June 2016 Supplement to DCFS B.H. Implementation Plan provided a clear statement of the \nrationale for the Implementation Plan’s experimentalist approach, particularly with regard to the \nImmersion Sites:3  \nWhat DCFS and the State of Illinois are undertaking is exceptionally ambitious and will \nrequire an intensity of focus to execute. Breaking down organizational silos of activity and \nresponsibility, changing ingrained cultural habits, managing more than a thousand private \ncontracts, and instituting new models of care with minimal negative impact on children in care is \nan extraordinary task. (p. 2)  \nThe foundation for the Implementation Plan is a Theory of Change that places an emphasis on \nbuilding capacity to deliver high-quality and timely services to children and families in order to \nimprove their functioning and expedite their goals. The Theory of Change suggests that planned \ninterventions will act upon strategic levers -- the capacity of adults to care for children, the \ncapacity of the system to identify and respond to needs with services, and the capacity of \n                                                           \n3 B.H. v Sheldon 88 C 5599 Defendant’s Submission Supplement to DCFS Implementation Plan  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 12 of 59 PageID #:2650\ncommunities to provide needed services and supports (p. 3). To this end, the implementation of \nthe Core Practice Model via Immersion Sites is the centerpiece of the plan, and the key vehicle \nfor improving practice and demonstrating impact and change. \n \nThe implementation of the Core Practice Model via Immersion Sites provides an opportunity to \ndemonstrate and test new ways of thinking about and providing care to children and families and \nhas been developed with the concept of adaptive challenges in mind. Within the Core Practice \nModel, front line workers and supervisors will be trained in the new model (adaptive) that shifts \nday to day work from compliance to critical decision-making (pp. 3 – 4). \n \nThe Implementation Plan is organized around embedding the Core Practice Model via Immersion \nSites, including the establishment of the processes and procedures of the new model of practice, \nthe reorganization of key supports, the integration of services to achieve a \ncommunity-based comprehensive array of services organized in a continuum of care, \ndevelopment of measures to ensure that improved outcomes of family preservation and \nreunification and permanence are being achieved, and methods to embed the processes and \nprocedures of the new model of practice in the culture of DCFS through training and coaching. \n \nThe Core Practice Model via Immersion Sites is the cornerstone of the plan and the efforts to \ntransform the entire DCFS system (p. 11).  Implementation of the Core Practice Model via \nImmersion Sites at DCFS will require a number of steps, including: considerable retraining and \ncoaching of staff, organizational restructuring, development of a comprehensive array of services, \nand the consistent feedback loops of quality assurance and control.  This approach facilitates \ninitial implementation of local technical assistance, resource development, training and coaching \nin fewer areas at one time which should make lasting improvements more likely (pp. 14-15). \n \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 13 of 59 PageID #:2651\nThe youth currently in residential or other highly restrictive programs have specialized mental \nhealth needs that the child welfare system has not and cannot effectively address. Many of them have \nneeds that require specialized behavioral health services, and those services either do not now exist or are \nnot available in many Illinois communities. The Immersion Sites are beginning to identify behavioral \nhealth service gaps and to take steps to obtain or encourage development of behavioral health services to \naddress some of the mental health needs many of their youth have. The Therapeutic Residential \nPerformance Management Initiative (TRPMI) has also identified significant behavioral health service \ngaps that are preventing youth from leaving residential treatment programs to community and home-\nbased settings. We do not yet know enough about the plan for expanding behavioral health services and \ncare coordination through the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (Medicaid) to be \nable to evaluate whether it will increase access and availability of needed behavioral health services. \nMoreover, implementation of the planned changes to Illinois’ behavioral health system for children in \nDCFS custody is not planned until at least 2018 and perhaps later, in 2019.  In the meantime, Illinois \nyouth in DCFS care with mental health needs will be more effectively served, and the Department will \nlearn the most about how to frame care coordination under managed care and roll out needed changes \nstatewide, only if the Department remains focused on making use of Immersion Sites as the “enabling \ncontext” within which it will design, test, evaluate and adapt responses to what Implementation Science \nrefers to as “technical” and “adaptive” challenges like those presented by the imperative to develop \nservice resources for high-needs youth.  \nThe Path Forward \nWith the unplanned resignation of the former DCFS director, George Sheldon, and the \nappointment of Acting Director, BJ Walker, the state is once again experiencing a turnover in leadership, \nwhich the 2015 Report of the Expert Panel identified as contributing to past difficulties in the \nDepartment’s achieving the objectives of the decree. The Acting DCFS Director comes with a wealth of \nleadership experience. The goals she has stated for child welfare align well with the objectives of the \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 14 of 59 PageID #:2652\nconsent decree. The continued involvement of Beth Solomon and Barbara Greenspan offers some \ncontinuity of leadership. \nWith any change in top leadership, however, come additional changes in other key leadership \npositions. Most notable are the resignation of Peter Digre, who led the Department’s implementation of \nthe plan and the transition of former DCFS General Counsel, Lise Spacapan, to General Counsel to the \nGovernor, and the recent replacement of Janet Ahern by Shawn Eddings as DCFS General Counsel. Mary \nNam and Marshae Terry have been hired in replacement roles for Peter Digre. To date, we have not seen \nthis new DCFS leadership decisively reinforce the Department’s commitment, as embodied in the \nImplementation Plan, to evidence-based negotiation, rolling-rule regimes, and transparency of \nimplementation and evaluation.  \nAny transition brings new challenges in maintaining the consistency of vision and on-going \ncommitments to past institutional assurances. Such challenges are heightened with consent decree reform.  \nThose with experience in other states’ reform efforts under consent decrees often are heavily compliance-\noriented in enforcing adherence to agreed-upon rules through strict surveillance and centralized control. \nThe approach that the Department is bound to take differs from the usual compliance-oriented approach \nthat enforces adherence to agreed-upon rules through strict surveillance and centralized control. It is what \nwe called in our Expert Panel Report, results-oriented accountability (Testa & Poertner, 2010). It is \nconsistent with the experimentalist approach of Sabel and Simon (2004) and focuses on selecting reform \nstrategies with the best available evidence of past success, implementing them with integrity, and \nevaluating their causal efficacy in attaining the desired results. It doesn’t dispense with compliance-\noriented accountability entirely, but instead simply suspends its application until after the entire process \nplays out in building credible evidence for what works best, what doesn’t work as well, and what should \nbe scaled-up, discontinued or replaced in order to promote the safety, family permanence, and wellbeing \nof members of the plaintiff class.  The Department has had more than 20 years of experience with \ncompliance-oriented reform efforts, and they have not worked.  The Department will not succeed in \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 15 of 59 PageID #:2653\nachieving compliance under the B.H. Decree if it does not adhere to its newly-adopted results-oriented \napproach. \nIn an early meeting with the Acting Director, she noted her basic agreement with the \nexperimentalist approach, if not with all of the consent decree’s specific requirements. We grouped the \nvarious initiatives contained in the Implementation Plan under the priorities listed below, which she \noutlined in remarks she gave at the Illinois-Joint DCFS Summit on Continuous Quality Improvement. \nNo Child Should Grow Up in  Child Welfare Workforce  Children Should Be Better Off \nFoster Care  Enhancement  Because of DCFS Involvement \n•  Expanded state funded  •  Care Management Entity  •  Therapeutic foster care \nguardianship  •  Immersion Sites  •  Regenerations for dually \n•  Amended definition of  •  Core Practice Model  involved youth \n“fictive” kin  •  Residential monitoring  •  Pay for success for dually \n•  Family finding  •  Implementation science  involved youth \n•  Safe families for children  •  Overarching outcomes  •  Illinois birth thru three (IB3) \nmeasures  waiver \n•  DCFS reorganization  •  Beyond Medical Necessity \n•  Information systems  •  Enhanced and expanded service \nenhancement  array in immersion sites \n \nIn our correspondence with the Acting Director, we have referenced these priorities as a way of \nreinforcing the following points. \n•  Acknowledging the necessity of a consent decree: The belief that no child should grow up in \nfoster care is at the heart of the consent decree. The charts below illustrate the entrenched nature \nof the problem of long-term foster care in Cook County and balance of state regions.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 16 of 59 PageID #:2654\n \nThe system has stabilized at a median length of stay that is the longest in the nation. Quite simply, \ntoo many children are growing up in foster care in Illinois and for far too long. The fact that the \nstasis of the system has persisted since the early 2000s in Cook County and longer in the balance \nof state, in spite of (or because of) changes in political and DCFS leadership is one of the major \nreasons that a supplemental implementation plan was required in order to disrupt this unhealthy \nequilibrium. As Sabel and Simon (2004) note, a federal court’s involvement is warranted \nwhenever public institutions have chronically failed to meet their constitutional obligations, and \nthe normal processes of political accountability (elections and administrative appointments) have \nproved inadequate for solving the problem. DCFS repeatedly has shown it cannot change the \ncurrent dynamic without a consent decree.   \n•  Enhancing the competency of the child welfare workforce:  The changes needed to disrupt the \nsystem in a productive way cannot be initiated and sustained without competent leadership, a \nsupportive enabling context, and a qualified workforce with sufficient expertise to implement \nevidence-based practice with families and children.  These are the basic principles of \nImplementation Science. As we noted in the Expert Panel report: “As frequently occurs with a \nlarge public agency, its capacity to advance its core mission became hampered over time by the \nproliferation of rules and regulation, the emergence of management silos, and the imposition of \nmultiple-approval processes. Such ’over-bureaucratization‘ leads to risk-adverse, compliance-\n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 17 of 59 PageID #:2655\noriented accountability in child welfare rather than results-oriented accountability that keeps the \nfocus on children, checks whether they are being effectively served, and adapts flexibly when \nresults are contrary to expectations.” (p. 20). We recommended that DCFS start the process of \npositive disruption through staged implementation and a phased-based approach to evidence \nbuilding in Immersion Sites before rolling-out statewide. The Department agreed to that approach \nbut is not adhering to it.  It is our recommendation that the Department step-up the involvement \nof NIRN in this process in order to reorient the Department and improve the prospects for \nsuccess.  \n•  Restoring the sense of collective efficacy that we were able to cultivate under the prior \nleadership:  Stakeholders’ shared belief in their collective efficacy to bring about change is \nessential for fulfilling the promise that children will be better off because of DCFS involvement \n(Bandura, 2001). An experimentalist approach, when practiced with integrity, strengthens the \nsense of collective efficacy of the Department as a whole by demonstrating that the desired \nimprovements are the result of DCFS involvement. It is not sufficient to demonstrate that the \nDepartment is merely complying with a “check-list” of procedural requirements. Nor is it \nadequate to track outcomes in the hopes that they begin to trend in the desired direction. The B.H. \nImplementation Plan aims to implement evidence-supported interventions and evaluate the results \nwith sufficient rigor in order to increase scientific confidence that the observed changes (for the \nbetter or worse) are truly attributable to DCFS involvement. In order to obtain the strongest \nevidence of impact, the Implementation Plan calls for conducting rigorous studies of promising \ninterventions so the Court and the parties can compare actual results to what might have \nhappened under “business as usual” or without DCFS involvement. Wherever feasible the Plan \nmakes use of rotational allocation, alternation, and random assignment to form comparable \ngroups for tracking outcomes compared to business as usual. Unbiased allocation of persons to \nintervention and comparison groups is the gold standard of rigorous assessment, which all \nbusiness, medical, and social work schools now recommend. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 18 of 59 PageID #:2656\nThe Expert Panel has been coaching B.H. Project Managers over the last year in the methods of \nimplementing a promising or evidence-based intervention in a way that enables us to draw generalizable \nconclusions about what is working and what is not. We find that B.H. Project teams that developed \ncoherent logic models, received adequate resources, implemented rigorous evaluation designs, and have \naccess to good data-support systems exhibit the greatest sense of collective efficacy; especially after \noutcomes start trending in the desired direction (e.g. IB3, Safe Families for Children). Those that lack \nthese supports are less confident (e.g. family finding, expanded state funded guardianship). Many of the \nprojects fall somewhere in between and are still retooling their logic models or struggling to understand \nproject shortfalls. Some initiatives have run their course and should be retired or replaced (e.g. Care \nManagement Entity, Pay For Success for dually involved youth). Without sustained reinforcement and \nadditional support for the experimentalist approach from DCFS leadership, we believe the Department is \nin danger of losing the advances already made in realizing the goals of the decree. \nII.  Diminished Support for and Cooperation With the Expert Panel.  \n \nOur initial efforts with the new DCFS leadership to build on the sense of collective efficacy and \ncommitment to negotiation based on persuasive argument and hard evidence have not been met with the \nsame spirit of collaboration and cooperation that we experienced in the past. The new DCFS leadership \nhas discussed major changes to the B.H. Implementation Plan, without offering accompanying rationales \nor supporting information. The Expert Panel finds that deeply concerning, especially for two key \ninitiatives that will be discussed more fully later in this report:  1) the planned timeframe for developing \ninternal Master Coach capacity to train, coach and mentor front line caseworkers, supervisors and \nfacilitators of Child and Family Teams consistent with the standards of the Department’s Core Practice \nModel, and 2) the criteria of an effective residential monitoring system and the timeframe for developing, \nif possible, the internal capacity for DCFS to implement an effective residential monitoring and quality \nimprovement system. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 19 of 59 PageID #:2657\nJust as concerning is the apparent change in attitude toward the Expert Panel’s intention to step-\nup our monitoring activities. In the proceedings before the Court on June 20, 2017, the Court inquired of \nthe Department’s view of the Expert Panel’s stepping up our monitoring activities and increasing our \nstaff. Ms. Greenspan of the Attorneys General Office responded by acknowledging that the Order \nappointing us contemplates bringing on additional staff and other consultants after consultation with the \nDepartment. She noted that the parties “contemplated from the beginning that there would be various \npoints in time when the experts' monitoring activities would be more intense than others. This is a time \nwhen I think they want to dig in on some issues that they've identified. And we welcome their \nparticipation. It’s always been very productive for the Department.” \nWe previewed portions of our staffing plan in an e-mail that Dr. Testa sent to Acting Director \nWalker on July 7, 2017 and did not receive a response. He followed-up with another e-mail to Mr. Digre \ndated July 31, 2017. In both e-mails, he expressed the Panel’s intention to engage Andy Barclay as a \nconsultant to advise the Panel on information technology issues. We received an immediate response \nfrom Mr. Digre, which raised for the first time the “zero-sum” argument that meeting our staffing needs \nfor independent consultation could potentially weaken the Department’s capacity to develop a much \nhigher degree of autonomy in producing the analytic data that it needs to drive a continuous quality \nimprovement process. To set up another external source of analytic data, he suggested, would not \nstrengthen and possibly weaken that capacity by increasing the DCFS dependence on external analysis. \nFrankly, we remain puzzled by this argument inasmuch as previous communications with the Department \n(see above court transcript) have always welcomed our participation and found our contributions to be \nvery productive for the Department.   \nMr. Digre suggested that our needs were better accommodated, in lieu of the Panel’s request for \nstaffing resources, by dedicating internal department resources available from its OITS Reporting Team \nand Quality Assurance staff, and by making special arrangements with Chapin Hall to ensure that we \nreceive all the data and analysis needed in a timely fashion. Frankly, we have concerns about these \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 20 of 59 PageID #:2658\nassurances. To fulfill our responsibilities to monitor the Implementation Plan and to report to the Court, \nwe need to maintain independent and unfettered access to and management of the data analytics and case \nreviews we determine are necessary to fulfill our responsibilities.  We informed the Department that its \noffer of internal staffing assistance and analytic and computer programming support from Chapin Hall as \nfiltered through the Department’s existing program plans was not acceptable. \nWe also took steps to explore other options for meeting our staffing needs, which preserve the \nindependence we need and maximize the Department’s resources already committed to these functions.  \nWe traveled to the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to meet with the incoming \nDean of the School of Social Work and the Director and staff of the Children and Family Research Center \n(CFRC). Dr. Testa was the Director of the Children and Family Research Center prior to his joining the \nUniversity of North Carolina in 2010. \nWe relied on the CFRC for data analytic support in preparing our 2015 Expert Panel report and \nhave found their annual Conditions of Children report useful for tracking the Department’s past progress \nin achieving outcomes. We have discussed our staffing needs with the new Dean and the current Director \nof CFRC. We believe our needs for independence align nicely with the substantial investment the \nDepartment is currently investing in the University of Illinois. The Center has agreed to accommodate our \ncurrent needs for timely analytical and programming support. In addition, their Foster Care Utilization \nReview Program (FCURP) houses staff that could assist us with our case review needs.  The Department, \nuntil just before we filed this letter, continued to resist this revenue-neutral solution without offering any \nalternative that would address the Expert Panel’s need for independent, unfiltered access to data. \nThe length and course of our attempted negotiation with the Department for support resources has \nbeen disappointing.  We hope the Department’s recent communication with us will result in an agreement \nabout our request to use CFRC for our staff and consultation needs. Important here is that these failed \ndiscussions are emblematic of a shift generally in our interactions with the Department.  Often, when \ninformation or data is requested, the Department’s responsive communication is poor. Several times, the \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 21 of 59 PageID #:2659\nDepartment has resisted our requests, saying that our requests do not fall within our areas of responsibility \nor authority. The Expert Panel’s ability to report to this Court is impaired by this lack of responsiveness \nand disclosure.     \nIII.  Findings and Data for the Department’s Three Core Categories of Priorities  \nIn the remainder of our report, we present data and discuss our preliminary analyses with respect \nto the three categories of priorities identified above: 1) ensuring that no child grows up in foster care; 2) \nenhancing the competencies of the child welfare workforce; and 3) confirming that children are better off \nbecause of DCFS involvement  \nA.  No Child Should Grow Up in Foster Care: The Problem of Long-Term Foster Care \nSabel and Simon (2004) make the argument that a consent decree is appropriate whenever public \ninstitutions chronically fail to meet their obligations and the normal processes of political accountability \nthrough administrative appointments and democratic elections have proved inadequate for resolving the \nproblem. As noted above, the entrenched problem that the B.H. Implementation Plan seeks to address is \nthe excessively long-lengths of time that infants, toddlers, older children, and adolescents spend in foster \ncare. Over 60 years of scientific research demonstrates the adverse effects of child maltreatment and lack \nof stable family attachments on later physical and mental health. The best way to reverse the damage is to \nrestore children safely to the custody of their parents, whenever feasible, or to find alternative permanent \nhomes in a timely fashion with their extended families, legal guardians, and adoptive parents. As we \nstated in our Expert Panel report: \nThe social and emotional wellbeing of children is best assured within the context of safe and \npermanent family relationships with birth parents, legal guardians, or adoptive parents, who \nparticipate the planning of individualized permanency and treatment plans crafted by child and \nfamily teams. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 22 of 59 PageID #:2660\nProlonging a child’s stay in foster care beyond necessity without regard to the child’s sense of \ntime is contrary to the best interests of children. Allowing adolescents to age out of state custody without \nlegal connections to family or at least one committed adult is destructive of their future well-being. The \nIllinois child welfare system continues to fail our children and youth on both counts. \nAs illustrated in the charts above (p. 16), the median length of stay in foster care in the balance of \ncounties outside of Cook County has stabilized at approximately 700 days since 2010. In Cook County, \nthe median time in care is in excess of 1,200 days. When children, who are returned home within a week \nof removal (releases from protective custody) are removed from the calculation, the median evens out at \napproximately 28 months in the balance of state and 49 months in Cook County.  \nThe Figure to the left compares the median \nmonths in care at the time of adoption to other \ncomparable urban counties nationwide with \nsimilar rates of child poverty (25 per 100 \npopulation under 18). As noted in our Expert \nPanel report, the atypically long lengths of \nfoster care in Cook County and the balance of \nstate is partly a by-product of past successes.    \nPrior to 2010, Illinois had been at the forefront of a nationwide transformation of the public child \nwelfare system. A major milestone in this transformation was the shift from long-term foster care to \nfamily permanence illustrated by the charts on page 16.  From 1997 to 2010, the number of foster children \nfell from over 50,000 in 1997 to under 15,000 in 2010. The number in assisted adoptive and guardianship \nhomes expanded from 12,000 to over 40,000 children in the mid-2000s. Currently there are almost 23,000 \nchildren in assisted adoptive and guardianship homes in Illinois. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 23 of 59 PageID #:2661\nThe shift from long-term foster care to family \npermanence also occurred on the removal side, \nwhen practice in Illinois shifted from taking \nchildren out of their homes to safely preserving \ntheir placement with family. This trend is \nillustrated in the same set of charts by the \nsteady decline after 1997 in the entry of \nchildren into foster care, which coincided with \nhome of relative reform and associated safety initiatives. The result of those initiatives was to reduce the \nper-capita rate of removal into foster care to one of the lowest in the nation. Compared to other urban \ncounties with similar levels of child poverty, only one county in the U.S. has a lower removal rate than \nCook County (see above Figure). \nThe challenge these past successes pose to continued improvement now that DCFS is responsible \nfor the care and custody of a smaller group of severely traumatized children is unmistakable. Children \npresent more complex needs and families are more challenging to serve. Because low rates of child \nremoval correlate with longer lengths of stay in foster care, Illinois’ median time in foster care predictably \nranks among the longest in the nation. However, a low rate of child removal is no excuse for inaction in \nfinding children with psychological, behavioral or emotional challenges permanent homes in a more \ntimely fashion. Instead, it calls for better ways of working with families and other interested persons (such \nas relatives, friends, and neighbors) in a collaborative process that brings formal resources to bear on \nassessing family needs, finding solutions to meeting those needs, tracking the accomplishment of agreed-\nupon tasks, and evaluating the results of these investments. In order for these efforts to succeed, it is \nessential that the process is truly collaborative and proceeds in a way that recognizes and affirms family \nstrengths, learns what the family hopes to accomplish, and designs individualized support and services \nthat match the family’s needs and builds of their strengths. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 24 of 59 PageID #:2662\n1.  Family Finding, State Funded Guardianship, and Expanded Definition of Relatives \nThree evidence-based, permanency enhancement initiatives have been incorporated into the B.H. \nImplementation Plan and are as follows: \n•  Family finding (tools for locating relatives who can provide a variety of supports to children and \ntheir families);  \n•  Expanded use of state funded guardianship (subsidies for kinship homes that don’t satisfy state \nlicensing requirements);  \n•  Amended definition of “fictive kin” (qualifies more foster families for the federal Guardianship \nAssistance Program). \nEach of these initiatives has been enacted into law since the implementation of the Plan and the \naccompanying rules and regulations are either completed or in process. The logic model below illustrates \nthe pathways through which it is expected that these permanency initiatives will translate into the outputs \nand outcomes of more timely guardianships, fewer days in foster care, stable permanent placements, and \nfewer youth who age-out of care lacking a lifelong connection to a family or at least one adult. The ability \nto monitor full implementation of the family finding and permanency enhancement initiatives and the \nimpacts on program outputs and child outcomes has been hampered by the absence of a dedicated CQI \nreviewer or university contractual support. In the interim, Dr. Mark Testa agreed to provide temporary \nmonitoring assistance until more permanent staffing arrangements could be made. However, as discussed \nabove, the Department’s resistance to honoring its previous commitment to provide the necessary \nresources makes it impossible for Dr. Testa, who has funded his time out of his university chair account, \nto continue offering this assistance. \nThe latest data on finalized guardianships during the first seven months of 2017 show a \nsubstantial improvement from the numbers posted in 2016 for the same period (see Table below). The \nuptick is particularly noticeable in the Immersion Sites of Lake and Mt. Vernon. Statewide the numbers \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 25 of 59 PageID #:2663\n \ndel                  Outcomes     Proximal                  Distal  Step-downs from More stable permanencies more restrictive Fewer age-outs with no placements lifelong connections Improved well-being Fewer independence  goals  Intermediate Side Effects  More timely adoptions More timely Reunification ruled-out guardianships too quickly   HFK with weak kinship Fewer children in care connections longer than HAP/SGH discontinuity 3 to 5 years of care     End-Values  •Maintaining family connections  •Cultural and language of origin maintained  •Family empowerment of placement options  •youth decide who they define as family Parents and  members. •Increased financial saving to DCFS as youth placed in  permanent homes cost less money than youth in care •Youth, through Family Finding, have a voice in where  they may find a permanent home.   •Through relatives and fictive kin more placement option  may be available to provide permanence and still maintain family connections.  \n   \n   \no    \nSGH/HFK/FF Logic M         Implementation                Outputs                                                                                   HFK rules finalized JCAR; Rule #, % of children with 302.410 finalized; P315 training  natural, informal, and Family Finding VTC training  formal supports Identification of children with no #, % of foster homes relative or fictive kin connections converted into HFK Family Finding activities  #, % of children in  HMR/HFK with Monitoring of Mindshare adoption and dashboard guardianship goals ACR review of Family Finding after 3 to 5 years in activities & SG goals care Reviews of cases without adoption and guardianship goals after 3 to 5 years in care    Theory of Change Parents empowered to engage in placement process by identifying potential  family connections. Courts and foster parents will accept philosophical shift  supporting timely reunification and placement with kin. Relatives will agree to  care for family members. Non-relatives will become HFK resources and  understand that permanence adoption and  through reunification, guardianship not long-term foster care is the priority goal. Caseworkers and  the Courts will accept that guardianship is just as stable as adoption and  waiting for TPR needlessly prolongs DCFS custody. Lowering the age for SG to  12, expanding eligibility to HFK, and removing licensing restriction for HMR  will enable more children youth to find permanence and shorten LOS in DCFS  custody.  25 \n   \n   \n      Resources                                         Youth in care aged 12 and older  Children who entered care  before age 4 and have goals  other than adoption and  guardianship after 3 years in  care  FY14-16 cohorts  •FF Activities  •Expanded SG eligibility  •HFK Definition  vs. FY 11-13 Cohorts  FY14-16 cohorts with no FF activities   External Conditions  Decline from 7% SGH for mid-  of youth 2000 cohortsaged 12  and older at entry to less than 3%  in mid-2010 cohorts  30% permanency gap between  Cook birth-thru-3 entries vs.  downstate after 3 years in care \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 26 of 59 PageID #:2664\nare bouncing back to the performance levels that the Department achieved in the early 2000s under the \nSubsidized Guardianship Waiver program.  \nThe numbers of children discharged to permanent guardianship arrangements dropped sharply \nafter 2009 when the waiver ended and the federal KinGap program began. KinGap is limited to children \nin licensed relative homes whereas non-licensed kinship homes were eligible under the waiver \ndemonstration. The restoration of much of the eligibility criteria from the waiver to the states’ IV-E GAP \nplan should greatly expand the utilization of subsidized guardianship as a permanency option.  \nThirty-one percent of the statewide increase in guardianships is attributable to the two Immersion \nSites of Lake and Mt. Vernon, which constitute only 5% of the state foster care population. It seems \nprobable that the refocus on guardianship in these two sites is primarily responsible for the increase rather \nthan any specific effects associated with family finding, state funded guardianship, and the expanded \ndefinition of fictive kin. Nonetheless, a refocus on guardianship in combination with these initiatives \nshould greatly increase utilization of subsidized guardianship in future years. \nFinalized Guardianships \n  Period \nJan-Jul  Jan-Jul \nArea  %Δ \n2016  2017 \nImmersion Sites  13  37  184.6% \n     East St. Louis  2  0  -100.0% \n     Lake  2  16  700.0% \n     Mt.

Currently less than 30% of the exits from care involve children \nwho entered foster care as adolescents, but they constitute 66% of the children who age-out of care or \nattain majority age while in foster care. Since 1981, the proportion of youth entering foster care as \nadolescents and who aged out or turned 18 while in care has risen from 23% to 45%. In the modern era of \nemerging adulthood when fewer and fewer persons are achieving full-fledged adulthood before age 25, no \nyoung adult should age out of care without formalizing a permanent legal connection to at least one older \nadult. Beginning in the Immersion Sites, DCFS should continue expanding its use of legal guardianship to \nensure that no young person in care turns 18 without first establishing or re-establishing a formal \nrelationship with a family or person to whom he, she or they can turn to in times of need.           \n2.  Safe Families for Children \nFamily finding assumes a latent network of informal support from relatives and fictive kin, which \ncan be activated in times of need to provide temporary help and assistance to parents whose children are \nat imminent risk of removal from their custody. When parents are isolated from informal networks, \nvoluntary organizations can often serve the same function by sponsoring families with whom parents can \ntemporarily place their children as an alternative to DCFS’s taking legal custody of the children. Safe \nFamilies for Children (SFC) is a promising program to prevent the removal of children into protective \ncustody by recruiting and overseeing a network of host families with whom parents can voluntarily place \ntheir children in times of need. Developed by LYDIA, a Chicago-based social service agency, SFC is \ncurrently operating in over 40 local sites across the U.S. \nSFC is a DCFS program that preexisted the appointment of the Expert Panel and was later \nincorporated into the B.H. Implementation Plan. The philosophy behind the program is similar to other \n“deflection” programs, such as alternative response and diversion to informal kinship care, which offer a \nnon-authoritarian response to family problems (see Logic Model). By offering an alternative to formal \nprotective custody, SFC allows for voluntary intervention without forcibly removing the children into  \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 28 of 59 PageID #:2666\n \n8 \n2\n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 29 of 59 PageID #:2667\nfoster care. According to advocates of this approach, the authoritarian approach of usual CPS procedures \nis not appropriate for many of the families that are investigated by DCFS and may even be \ncounterproductive to the goals of ensuring child safety, family permanence, and the social and emotional \nwell-being of vulnerable children and youth (Waldfogel 1998).  \nOn average, children stay with their SFC host families for 45-55 days before they are able to \nreturn safely to the custody of their parents. After the hosting arrangement has ended, the intention is for \nthe two families to remain in contact and sustain the “bridging social capital” (Testa, Bruhn & Helton, \n2010) that ideally was built up between the families during the hosting period. The expectation is that the \nsupportive arrangement will continue after the children are reunified with their birth family.  \nThe brief period of voluntary hosting of children compares favorably to the many years that \nchildren remain in foster care after DCFS takes formal custody. DCFS administrative data indicated that \neach quarter there are from 1,200 to 1,400 families that meet the SFC hosting profile in the original target \nsites of Cook County and the Northern DCFS region. It includes children who are involved in “A” \nsequence allegations of inadequate shelter or supervision, environmental neglect, or substantial risk of \nabuse. The program works best when all of the siblings are under the age of 6 years old. Follow-up \nindicates that approximately 150 of these families will typically be re-reported for maltreatment within a \nyear or endure the removal of the children from their custody. It is the assumption of the SFC program \nthat DCFS could do better by these children by referring them to SFC for voluntary hosting rather than \ntaking them into foster care. \nThe Arnold Foundation funded Dr. Mark Testa to conduct the evaluation of the program. The \nanticipated 120 family referrals from DCFS investigators for the first quarter of 2016 did not materialize \nas shown in the table below.  It was only after SFC established a back-up randomization plan for \ninvestigators that by-passed the automated DCFS allocation system that the total number of referrals \napproached the desired targets. The use of two allocation procedures, however, resulted in the assignment \nof the same families to both the intervention and comparison groups.

Reports \nSubtotal  68  70  138 \n TOTAL  217  240  457  from the field indicate that some investigators are \nresistant to making referrals because half of the families will be allocated to services as usual. \nUnfortunately, this resistance amounts to offering families “none of the loaf, if only a  random half can \nreceive some of the loaf.” Originally, the expectation was that too few families would be available to host \nall of the referrals, so randomization was the fairest way to divvy up the requests. With all Cook County \nreferrals now going into the intervention group, the hope is that referrals to SFC will pick-up. \n   By restricting the pilot to downstate regions, where multiple assignments and “cross-overs” have \nnot been a problem, the hope is that solid evidence can be collected on the effectiveness of SFC in safely \ndeflecting child from foster care. The results so far are encouraging. As of December 30, 2016, children \nreferred to SFC outside of Cook County spent, on average, 14 days in foster care compared to 36 days for \nchildren assigned to business as usual for a difference of 22 days. The combined average daily \nadministrative and maintenance costs of foster care amount to $85 per day. When applied to the average \nof 22 days of foster care that was averted as a result of families being allocated to the SFC intervention, \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 31 of 59 PageID #:2669\nthe total savings from deflection amounted to an average of $1,870 per child. On the assumption that the \naverage length of stay of children taken into foster care in the comparison group will last much longer \nthan 36 days, the net savings per child could into the tens of thousands of dollars. These savings would be \nbetter invested in additional “front end” resources that help children remain with their families than \npaying for their upkeep in foster care. \nIn order to generate solid evidence on the cost-effectiveness of SFC and its efficacy in \nmaintaining children in the safe and stable care of their families, it will be important to increase the \nnumber of SFC referrals downstate and make sure CPS investigators follow-through on helping families \nmake contact with the program. Currently, investigators follow through on only one-half of the families \nwho agree to SFC hosting services. The Department has agreed to step-up compliance efforts in the \nImmersion Sites. The Expert Panel recommends that NIRN be brought in to assist in these compliance \nefforts as well as other B.H. initiatives in the Immersion Sites.  \nAs the efforts to operate and evaluate the SFC model shows, incomplete compliance by the \nDepartment poses one of the most serious challenges to results-oriented accountability. Failure to inform \nclients of available service options is a breach of fiduciary responsibility. Less obvious but equally \ndamaging non-compliance is the deliberate diversion of clients to experimental services when an unbiased \nallocation process assigns them to receive services as usual. Both actions are clear violations of \nimplementation integrity. Each elevates worker biases and discretion over policy references and undercuts \ncollaborative efforts to build credible evidence that would establish whether or not a promising innovation \nis better in achieving the desired outcomes than “services as usual.”  Deliberate diversion of families may \nfeel less serious than the former because workers previously have been allowed, if not are encouraged, to \ndevote their energies to obtaining what they believe is in their clients’ best interests irrespective of the \nstrength of the evidence in support of their beliefs. Many stakeholders perceive any constraint on worker \ndiscretion, even for purposes of narrowing agency uncertainty over the cost effectiveness and benefits of \nplanned interventions, as unfair; some regard it as unethical. That is simply wrong, and NIRN can help \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 32 of 59 PageID #:2670\novercome these implementation challenges and improve the Department’s ability to learn what works and \nwhat doesn’t, and then to make good on the promise that no child should grow up in foster care. \nB.  Enhancing the competency of the child welfare workforce:  \n1.  Immersion Sites \nThe mechanism we recommended in the Expert Panel report for improving the Department’s \ninvolvement with children and families is through a staged “immersion” process of retraining and \ncoaching front-line staff in the Department’s Core Practice Model and two of its primary components, \nChild and Family Team Meetings (CFTM) and Quality Service Review (QSR) processes. The goal is to \nprovide children and their families with access to a comprehensive array of services, including intensive \nhome-based services, designed to enable children to live with their families or to achieve timely \npermanence with adoptive parents or legal guardians.  \nThe new DCFS leadership has questioned the timeline and rationale for installing the Core \nPractice Model and its primary components, CFTM and QSR, in a selected set of jurisdictions serving \nonly 10% of the plaintiff class when the need appears to be greatest in Cook County. The reason we \nrecommended piloting the experimentalist approach in immersion sites where the problems appeared \ntractable and the costs of immersion were affordable was that the interventions should be validated before \nthey are rolled out to areas where the problems were more entrenched, such as Cook County.  \n As illustrated in the chart, the immersion sites parallel \nthe challenges of serving children and families outside \nof the jurisdiction of the Cook County Juvenile Court. \nEven though length of stay is lower in the Immersion \nSites and balance of state (BOS), the median for both \ngroups has been trending upward almost in lockstep. \nUsing the non-Cook, non-Immersion Site balance of \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 33 of 59 PageID #:2671\nstate (BOS) downstate counties as a comparison group with the Immersion Sites affords an early glimpse \nof whether the immersion site process is working and merits roll out to other downstate counties as well \nas Cook County.  \nThe progress registered to date is encouraging. Compared to the BOS comparison group, \nadoptions increased by 37% in the BOS and by 49% in the Immersion Sites in the first 7 months of 2017 \ncompared to the same period in 2016. More striking, guardianships increased by 49% in the BOS and by \n185% in the Immersion Sites. The small baseline volume of guardianships (13) finalized in the Immersion \nsites in 2016, however, exaggerates the magnitude of the difference. Perhaps of greater significance is the \nfact that reunification increased by 14% during this period in the Immersion sites, whereas it decreased \nby 14% in the BOS (see Appendix comparing differences across sites).  \nDespite these positive signs, it is still too early to tell whether the permanency improvements in \nthe immersion sites are attributable to the CFTM model and QSR processes. Based on the reports we hear \nin our regular meetings with Immersion Site directors and trainers and coaches from Child Welfare Group \n(CWG), we believe the process is greatly enhancing the competency of the child welfare workers in \nengaging with and serving families. The Immersion Site directors are seeing positive changes in child and \nfamily team meetings through their provider agency workforce based on the training and coaching done \nby CWG. They are also receiving enthusiastic and positive feedback from providers who have \nparticipated in training and in subsequent child and family team meetings and have seen families become \nbetter engaged and get “unstuck.” CWG agreed they are also seeing a lot of progress.  \nYet, we also know through the same reports, meetings and phone conferences that this progress \nand excitement is fragile. The new DCFS leadership has expressed a preference for accelerating the roll-\nout of the process and stepping-up Chapin Hall’s evaluation of the initiative so that a decision can be \nmade in January of 2018 as to whether to extend or curtail the contract with CWG. In essence, that \nrequires that CWG deviate from its model.  Accelerating the timetable now after there were departmental \ndelays executing the original contract is not only ill-advised, it threatens to undermine the CFT model \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 34 of 59 PageID #:2672\naltogether, if not guarantee its failure. Based on the information shared at our last conference call, it \nappears that the Department will not reach its projected goal of training 25-28 master coaches by the end \nof December or even by the early part of next year. Instead, it looks like the revised goal is to train only \n19 master coaches. The reason for this shortfall is related to staff turnover, which is a larger problem that \nis not unique to the Immersion Sites and needs to be addressed. Providers have voiced their concern to the \nImmersion Site directors that the accelerated schedule is too demanding and is imposing too heavy a \nburden on their supervisors and workers. For example, in the Lake County Immersion Site, a master \ncoach dropped out because of the accelerated timetable. A CWG trainer commented on the noticeable \nchange from the July trainings to the October trainings, which are more compact and only half-full. \nAdditionally, in Lake County, staff criticized how quickly the Department is doing the trainings in \nOctober, limiting the time they have available to prepare and meet with families before the scheduled \nchild and family team meetings, while also fulfilling their other job responsibilities. Providers do not feel \nthat it is sustainable, they are more negative, and they are participating less. \nIn response to a DCFS request for suggestions and recommendations to strengthen \nimplementation of the Core Practice Model, child and family teams, and QSRs in the Immersion Sites, \nPaul Vincent, Director of the Child Welfare and Policy Practice Group provided on October 16, 2017, \nseveral recommendations to DCFS and the Expert Panel.  His recommendations, included below, were \nbased on the experiences his staff are having in the field in Illinois, in addition to their years of experience \ntraining, coaching and embedding effective casework practice into child and family teams and overall \ncasework with children and families in many other states.  \nWe [The Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group] have been conferring about ways to \nstrengthen implementation and have some observations and strategies for us all to consider.  The \nchallenges we are encountering are not surprising for a reform in its early stages.  In fact, the \nimmersion process was adopted in part to provide a mechanism for identifying barriers early in \nimplementation.  We now have the opportunity to address the obstacles we are encountering so \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 35 of 59 PageID #:2673\nthe next immersion phase doesn’t experience them.   We have identified some of the \nimplementation challenges we have encountered and our suggestions are below. \n \nCHALLENGES  \nThe Pace of Reform  - Many of us recognized the ambitious pace of reform early in the \nprocess.  That intensity can overwhelm some of the smaller POS agencies which have a smaller \nnumber of staff and like all the agencies, many ongoing day-to-day obligations.  As a result, it can \nbe difficult for some POS agencies to make time available for CFT training and coaching.  \nStaff Turnover – Continuous staff turnover and competing personal obligations (such as annual \nand sick leave, other DCFS training obligations) are facts of life in child welfare and impact not \nonly POS agencies, but master coach staff as well.  When staff who are developed to train and \ncoach leave the agency, change roles and or are unavailable when training opportunities are \noccurring, the capacity building process is slowed and technical assistance resources are \nunderutilized. \n  \nGeography – In larger regions, Department coaches may experience time-consuming travel \nbetween their base and POS offices, lessening their time to receive coaching \nthemselves.  Immersion sites may also be distant from the base of some Department coaches in \ntraining and commuting lessens their availability for development on-site.  Some DCFS coaches \nhaving a limited number of days on site also makes it difficult to schedule team meetings with \nfamilies and to provide the needed coaching to POS and DCFS staff as CFTM facilitators. \n  \nExpectations – It would be unusual for expectations to have a high level of clarity at this early \nstage of immersion, but limited clarity does impede progress.  There are instances of POS staff \nnot viewing the importance of training or coaching with the priority needed to command their \npresence or preparation for training and coaching events.   Competing priorities are a factor in \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 36 of 59 PageID #:2674\nthis challenge.  The lack of clarity can be manifested in lack of participation, selection and \npreparation of families and scheduling. \n \nAccountability – Many local staff are trying to respond to expectations, but some don’t see the \nCFT implementation process as imperative or lasting, and as a result haven’t fully committed to \nit.  If their agency leadership doesn’t hold them accountable for joining the CFT developmental \nprocess, it is not clear who else has authority to do so.  The Immersion Site Directors are doing \ngreat work, but as we understand it, they don’t have formal authority over the POS agencies in \ntheir region.  If they don’t, who does?  \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nExpand the Immersion Site Size – In the smaller sites, especially those with multiple small POS \nagencies, add a county (or more) to permit training and coaching to be spread over a larger \nnumber of agencies.  This would lessen the pressure on a smaller number of agencies, maximize \nthe technical assistance resources and ultimately enlarge the footprint of immersion \nimplementation. \n  \nRe-emphasize the Importance of Immersion – It has been quite some time since excitement of \nthe initial Summit, which kicked-off the reform.  The collaborative planning that occurred in local \nsummits in early 2017 is more recent, but there haven’t been frequent collaborative meetings to \nassess progress and problem solve.  It will be helpful to re-convene immersion site stakeholders \nfor a discussion of lessons learned and identification of strategies to make immersion \nsuccessful.  This would not only be an opportunity for re-engagement and expectation setting, it \nwould also be a forum for identifying strategies for lessening some contract obligations to give \nagencies time to fully join the immersion process.  We have all agreed that this should be \nexplored, but decisions are still pending. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 37 of 59 PageID #:2675\n Expect Accountability – There has been a general acknowledgement that accountability for \nfront-line POS performance is so diffuse that there is not a functional single point of \naccountability that can be reasonably expected to be effective.  This is a long-standing and very \ncomplex challenge, but one that seems essential to change.  We don’t have a simple solution to \nsuggest and believe that addressing this issue belongs at the highest levels of the \norganization.  However, we recommend that we explore it collaboratively to try to identify ways \nto at least strengthen accountability. \n  \nRe-convene the Immersion Planning Team – Quickly re-convene the immersion planning \nteam, consisting of DCFS leadership/managers, Immersion Site Directors, CWG leadership and \nthe Experts to identify strategies to strengthen the immersion process.4 \n   \nThe CWG’s observations and analyses are consistent with ours, which we have communicated to \nDepartment leadership for the past several months.  Yet the Department did not act promptly after \nreceiving CWG’s recommendations, and it instead resisted the request to even reconvene the Immersion \nPlanning Team.   \n  As we noted in the Introduction to this report, we are very concerned that the Department’s \nstatements in our recent discussions and the content of its latest court report, demonstrate a lack of \nunderstanding of the scope and complexity of certain individual initiatives themselves, the challenges \nalready encountered at the current phase of implementation, and that successful implementation of any \none of the initiatives is inextricably linked to successful implementation of other initiatives. We concur \nwith the recommendations included in the Child Welfare Group correspondence and urge the Department \nto carefully consider them and take steps to act on them unless there is overwhelming evidence to the \n                                                           \n4 Email from Paul Vincent, Director, The Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group, to Mary Nam, DCFS, and the Expert Panel, \nOctober 16, 2017 \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 38 of 59 PageID #:2676\ncontrary. The Expert Panel is looking for evidence that the Department is still committed to the CWG \nmodel as originally designed and as it was accepted by the Department through the B.H. Implementation \nPlan. \nWe can appreciate the desire of the new DCFS leadership to accelerate the implementation of the \nimmersion site process so a determination about sustainability can be made more quickly. As discussed \nby Torgerson, Torgerson, and Taylor (2015), administrators and policymakers, particularly politicians, are \noften anxious to implement an intervention as soon as possible. But this is a desire that must be held in \ncheck.  The Department’s initiatives are not tied to a particular Governor or a particular Director.  What \nmatters under the Implementation Plan is that an innovative practice must be implemented in a way that \nsupports its chance for success rather than communicating to constituencies that new leadership is \n“getting down to business.” \nStaged implementation is often the more efficient and effective method of rollout than the so-\ncalled “big-bang” approach. For example, in a study of both approaches to the rollout of a novel method \nof offender supervision by probation officers, Pearson and colleagues (2010) found that broad-scale \nimplementation was problematic because there are seldom sufficient resources to deliver adequate \ntraining to all places at the same time.  Process measures indicated that the area that had adopted the \nstaged-approach utilized services more effectively than the big-bang rollout. The Immersion Site directors \nand CWG do not want to give up on the process and are on board since they are truly gaining buy-in and \nseeing improvement. Adhering to the original timetable is critical to the collective efficacy of the process, \nparticularly the CFT trainings, which are the core ingredient in the Immersion Site logic model. The \nDepartment has signaled an openness to reconsidering the accelerated timetable. In the interests of \ntransparency, we have also pushed for greater specificity about the criteria the Department intends to use \nto evaluate this phase of the pilot and whether evaluation by the end of the year is at all feasible.  \n \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 39 of 59 PageID #:2677\nImmersion Site Logic Model     Implementation              Outputs                         Outcomes                                                                         Proximal          Distal 1.N, % of all case  1.Hire Immersion Directors  related personnel in 2.Develop FTS/QSR/MoSP  ••Average number of  % children that remain  Immersion Sites practice model.                days of residential in same family as who are trained and 3.Provide coaching and QA to  care (-) initially engaged in coached in QSR and ensure fidelity to FTS/QRS •CFTM (+) % indicated repeat  FTS/MoSP model of 4.Develop new evidence based  •maltreatment (-) Safety in care (+)  practice service array and process and •• Median number of  Permanence within 2.N, % of child and  organization simplifications. days in foster care   12, 24 and 36 months family teams 5.Align field offices and regions  (-) (+) (CFTM)  that engage with Judicial Circuits.   families and youth   IntermediateTraining, coaching, QA using QSR, 3.N, % of families   Side-Effects Intensive evidence based wrap utilize new intensive around array, simplified processes, array of services  •Average N of  % disrupted improved organization. 4.EPSDT and dental  placement moves (-)  reunifications,  within one year •adoptions and  % and number of 1.Quality assurance processes  5.Supervised and  guardianships (0) youth who enter care using QSR scoring. unsupervised after age 12 and are 2.Process and outcome tracking  visitation frequency reunited with their and evaluation 6.Increase family care  families adopted, or 3.Comparing outcomes with non-   discharged toimmersion sites  guardianship (+)  Theory of Change End-Values  The QSR with FTS enhancements have proven to be effective in •Reduced reliance on institutional care   improving case work practice and outcomes in several states. •Increased resources available to further increase  Considerable evidence supports the effectiveness of intensive evidence- placement stability and permanency planning. based or -supported wrap around family based services to resolve •Improved placement stability and family  problems so that children and youth can live in families who are permanence and  committed to them for life.

Enhancing the competency of the child welfare workforce: Residential Monitoring \nAlthough DCFS has had an internal capacity to monitor residential facilities for a number of \nyears, the July 2015 Report of the Expert Panel noted several concerns with that internal capacity to both \nmonitor and evaluate programs and services for the youth in group homes and residential treatment \ncenters. We noted that: (1) clinical expertise, especially related to the milieu management of youth with \nsevere emotional and behavioral problems, is not a job requirement for residential monitors, (2) \nresidential monitors are unable to identify poorly functioning programs, (3) residential monitors lack \nviable problem-resolution strategies, (4) a dearth of high-end treatment options led DCFS to continue to \nuse inadequate treatment programs that are unable to maintain the safety and well-being of youth in its \ncare. Thus, the Expert Panel, along with the plaintiffs, recommended that DCFS enlist the assistance and \nguidance of external monitors and engage some of its university partners to develop a results-oriented \naccountability residential monitoring system. DCFS’ response to these concerns was a proposal to \nrestructure and re-envision its monitoring capacity through several university partnerships and in \naccordance with implementation science.5  DCFS partnered with Northwestern University (NW) and the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to develop an improved monitoring system pilot – the Therapeutic \nResidential Performance Management Initiative (TRPMI). Chapin Hall was selected as the evaluator for \nthe initiative. \nIn the June 2016 Supplemental Submission to the DCFS Implementation Plan, the Department \nacknowledged that its existing monitoring division has focused on facilities and programs. As the Expert \nPanel underscored, and the Department recognized, it is important to make a clinical assessment of all \nindividual children and youth in residential programs—not simply monitor programs and facilities. \nAlthough enhanced, the redesigned monitoring system comprised of 3 pilot monitoring teams (comprised \nof clinical, monitoring, and quality improvement staff that are a mix of staff internal to DCFS and \nexternal with the partner universities) was similar to the primary goals of the previous monitoring \n                                                           \n5 B.H. v Sheldon 88 C 5599 Defendant’s Submission Supplement to DCFS Implementation Plan \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 41 of 59 PageID #:2679\nprogram.6 The Department continued to fulfill its residential monitoring responsibilities and activities \nthrough its existing monitoring program for those residential programs not included in the TRPMI pilot.  \nNotably, the Department anticipates, and the Implementation Plan contemplates, that in the long-\nterm, all caseworkers and supervisors will be trained and coached in the components of the Department’s \nCore Practice Model to evaluate youth through a clinical lens and develop strength-based, family-focused \nservice and permanency plans. Thus, in January 2017, the parties and the Expert Panel agreed that the \nprimary focus of the redesigned pilots would be to monitor youth and their progress from a clinical \nperspective in addition to the regulatory monitoring to ensure program compliance.  \nAs noted in the current and previous Triannual B.H. Reports, there have been a variety of \nimplementation challenges for the TRPMI pilots that continue to adversely impact the pilots – filling staff \npositions for the pilot teams (DCFS and university partners); delays “matching” youth who are ready to \nleave residential programs with appropriate family-based homes (foster care, specialized foster care, \ntherapeutic foster care) through the centralized matching process; the lack of access to and availability of \nneeded treatment interventions and supports for youth upon return to their communities; and ongoing \nperformance, quality and operational issues in the residential programs themselves that impact every level \nof the overall service system.7 Beginning in the early months of the TRPMI pilot implementation, TRPMI \nstaff from the external university partners informed the Department in weekly and monthly reports and \nmeetings of the substantial challenges they were encountering when identifying youths’ needs for less \nrestrictive services, supports and living arrangements in their home communities. Many of these \nchallenges were not unexpected and/or have existed for many years. Even with pilot TRPMI teams that \nare more staff and expertise-rich than the Department’s existing monitoring program, once the TRPMI \npilot design added the function of monitoring individual youth and their clinical progress to the pilot \nteam’s existing regulatory monitoring, the pilot teams have struggled to meet the current objectives of the \n                                                           \n6 Second Triannual Interim Report to the Court filed June 9 2017, Attachment S., Page ID#:2314 \n7   Lessons Learned: Critical Issues Related to Residential Treatment Services in Illinois, Alan Morris, PsyD, UIC, Department of \nPsychiatry, Email to Mary Nam, October 13, 2017,   Exhibit 1.\n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 42 of 59 PageID #:2680\nTRPMI pilot design. \n  The lack of access to and existence of needed community-based behavioral health services and \nfamily-based living settings, especially specialized and therapeutic foster care, contribute to longer stays \nin residential programs than are appropriate. The TRPMI pilot teams have identified a large number of \nyouth currently placed in their assigned residential programs whose needs can be met in community and \nfamily-like settings and have identified the specific service, policy and practice barriers preventing each \nyouth’s move from the more restrictive residential program. The Department has not developed a \ncohesive plan to address the service gaps for youth with complex behavioral health needs.  \n  The B.H. Implementation Plan contemplates that adjustments and changes to the plan’s objectives \nand activities will be needed. It is important to apply a thoughtful and rigorous process when considering \npossible changes to the plan. Department leadership has told us that its primary goal regarding the TRPMI \npilot is to “bring the work back inside the Department” as soon as possible.  Rather than focusing on the \nrecommendations that have been offered to improve and stabilize the TRPMI initiative itself, the \nDepartment has asked for assistance in crafting proposed criteria for an effective residential monitoring \nsystem, a description of the required elements, staff functions, competencies, and timeframes to \ndemonstrate that the Department has the necessary internal capacity to effectively monitor, evaluate and \npromote therapeutic residential program effectiveness.  But the work required to consider changes to this \nor other initiatives in the Implementation Plan, both internally by the Department and then collectively \nwith the plaintiffs and Expert Panel, has not yet occurred. It is premature to consider a timeframe for \nchanging the Plan until everyone (and the Court) is in agreement about the reasons for proposed changes \nand the necessary alternatives to be put in place to achieve the agreed-upon objectives of the \nImplementation Plan and requirements of the Consent Decree.     \n3.  Enhancing the competency of the child welfare workforce: Care Management Entity \nFrom the Department’s earlier reports, the goals for the Care Management Entity (CME) pilot \ninclude:  increasing non-traditional, community-based behavioral health supports; faster step-downs for \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 43 of 59 PageID #:2681\nyouth in congregate care settings; treating youth and family voice and choice as primary factors in \npermanency planning and mental health/behavioral health interventions; placement of youth in \nspecialized foster care or congregate care settings rather than residential treatment facilities; increased \nplacement stability at the foster care level; high service-intensity youth receiving necessary behavioral \nhealth supports and services in their home and community settings; decreased psychiatric hospitalization; \nand increased permanence.  The CME pilot, which is administered though Choices, began in February \n2014 and is now scheduled to continue through June 30, 2018.  The Department’s Triannual Status \nReports contain additional details about the CME pilot and the extent to which it has met and is meeting \ntarget outputs and outcomes.  \nIt is anticipated that the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (IDHFS) will \nimplement a Medicaid managed care program through a Managed Care Organization (MCO) contract \nwith IlliniCare Health Plan for the children in DCFS’ care beginning in FY 2019. There are several \nlessons learned from the CME pilot that warrant further examination and should inform decisions about \nthe design and operation of the Medicaid-funded behavioral health service system for youth in DCFS \ncare: \n•  Several of the services included in the CME pilot have had positive impacts and should be \nincluded in the MCO benefit package for DCFS youth, e.g., mobile crisis response, \ntherapeutic mentoring, home-based support, case/care management. \n•  For youth in DCFS care, their behavioral health needs make up a portion of their overall \nneeds for safety, permanence and wellbeing. Plans and services to address a youth’s \nbehavioral health needs must be integrated and coordinated with the youth’s overall plan \ndeveloped by the DCFS child and family team. The CME pilot has included a “care manager” \nrole to lead the team and coordinate the provision of services to address the youth’s \nbehavioral health needs. The role of the CME care manager and how it fits with the role of \nthe DCFS/POS permanency worker has proved to be challenging during the CME pilot’s \nduration and has led to both confusion and conflict about who is ultimately responsible for \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 44 of 59 PageID #:2682\nensuring that all of the child’s needs are met through the Child and Family Team. That \nresponsibility falls to the permanency worker/case manager as the Child and Family Team \nfacilitator.  \n•  The planned IDHFS MCO model contract includes a “care coordinator” role responsible for \nleading a multi-disciplinary team to plan and coordinate the delivery of Medicaid-funded \nbehavioral health services.  As described, this “care coordinator” role is comparable to the \ncare manager role in the CME pilot yet the proposed MCO “care coordinator” does not have \nresponsibility for the child’s overall plan and services.  That responsibility is assigned to the \nDCFS/POS permanency worker as the leader of the youth’s Child and Family Team.  \n•  In both the CME pilot and Regenerations, youth have received certain individualized \ncommunity-based services (e.g., therapeutic mentoring, mobile crisis, case management/care \ncoordination, home-based support) which should be incorporated into the MCO’s Medicaid-\nfunded behavioral health service system. However, the Department does not have child-\nspecific or aggregate information readily available about the amount, frequency, duration, \nand per unit cost of each service provided to youth in care. Such information would assist \nboth DCFS and IDHFS in determining the type and amounts of these community-based \nbehavioral health services that should be routinely available for youth in DCFS care. \nThe implementation of the Behavioral Health Managed Care MCO contract for DCFS youth is \nplanned for FY19, a target date that is fast approaching. Significant planning and agreements between the \nIDHFS and DCFS are essential if the MCO contract is to be implemented successfully. While the contract \nis ultimately the responsibility of IDHFS to negotiate and execute with its selected provider, DCFS is not \nand cannot be a passive participant in this process.  Accessing more Medicaid-funded behavioral health \nservices enables DCFS to use its child welfare resources to develop and fund other much-needed services \nand supports that fall outside the behavioral health service system, but are nevertheless essential for the \nsafety, permanence and well-being of class members. We have asked to meet with the responsible \nindividuals from or representing IDHFS, DCFS and with plaintiffs’ counsel to better understand the plans \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 45 of 59 PageID #:2683\nfor defining and implementing the needed array of Medicaid-funded behavioral health services for DCFS \nyouth through the MCO contract.  We have asked to be included and expect to remain involved in the \nefforts undertaken by both departments to address the behavioral health needs of DCFS youth.  \nC.  Learning whether children are better off because of DCFS involvement:  \n1.  Overarching Outcomes  \nThe Expert Panel agrees with the simple maxim: “If it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it.” When we \nsigned off on the B.H. Implementation Plan, we agreed to a set of overarching outcome measures, which \nare substantially the same as the safety and permanency outcome measures that are currently utilized in \nthe federal Child and Family Service Review (CFSR) process. Based on these standards, there is much \nabout the Department’s performance that is commendable, but other areas that require fixing. \n•  Rates of maltreatment in foster care are below the national standard of 8.5 victimizations \nper day of foster care for all areas during the latest reporting period from August 1, 2016 \nthru July 31, 2017. \nMaltreatment in Care Per 100K Days \n  Cohort \n8/1/14- 8/1/15- 8/1/16-\nArea  7/31/15  7/31/16  7/31/17 \nImmersion Sites  6.20  8.51  4.44 \n     East St. Louis  3.37  7.41  3.55 \n     Lake  2.45  3.10  2.50 \n     Mt.

The only outcome measure that raises serious \nreason for concern, as inferred from the above data on median lengths of stay, is the low percentage of \nchildren who are discharged to permanent homes within 12 months of entry into foster care. It is \nsometimes suggested that Illinois’s low rate of re-entry is a by-product of its low rate of permanence \nwithin 12 months of removal. But a quick comparison among geographical areas with higher rates of \nreunification the year prior to the re-entry calculation indicates that the correlation is far from unity. Cook \nCounty registered the lowest permanency rate at 14.3% in 2016 but a re-entry rate of 9.0, which is higher \nthan the national standard. It will be important to learn from next year’s data whether Lake’s permanency \nrate of 40.5% in 2017 is followed by a high percentage who re-enter foster care. The lessons from the IB3 \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 48 of 59 PageID #:2686\ndemonstration are that trauma-informed, evidence-supported parenting training programs can expedite \nreunification with birth parents. Serious attention should be given to offering these services to parents \nshortly after children’s removal so that the family can be reunited sooner than the three years it currently \ntakes in Cook County for one-fourth of infants and toddlers to be reunified with their families.   \nThe IB3 program focuses on expediting the discharge of infants and toddlers to permanent \nhomes. Most of the other B.H. initiatives focus on stepping adolescents down to less restrictive \nplacements in preparation for finding them permanent homes and preventing them from aging out without \na permanent connection to family or a responsible adult. These other initiatives include: therapeutic foster \ncare, Regenerations for dually involved youth, Pay For Success for dually involved youth, and services \nfor youth in hospitals beyond medical necessity. \n2.  Learning whether children are better off because of DCFS involvement: Therapeutic Foster \nCare \nWe have already commented on the success of the IB3 demonstration in expediting the discharge \nof infants and toddlers to nuclear and extended family settings. We have noted the importance of rigorous \nevaluation and the challenges with SFC implementation in Cook County. Adherence to the basic \nprinciples of implementation science distinguishes the successes of IB3 and SFC in downstate counties \nfrom other initiatives that continue to struggle.  \nImplementation science equates programmatic success with a combination of three factors. These \ninclude: 1) selection of an intervention with the best available evidence of past success; 2) \nimplementation of the intervention with integrity and fidelity to the previously tested design; and 3) co-\ncreation of a supportive enabling context that promotes teamwork, shared access to data systems, and \ncontinuous quality review of programmatic outputs and client outcomes. Most of the B.H. initiatives \nsatisfy the first criterion but fall short on the other two. The weakest of initiatives fall short on all three \ncriteria.  \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 49 of 59 PageID #:2687\nOne of the weakest initiatives, which pre-existed but later became incorporated into the B.H. \nImplementation plan is the Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) Pilot. The initiative called for the recruitment \nand training of foster parents by three (3) providers to provide treatment foster care to children and youth \nwho require the same intensity of treatment as residential care. After many false starts, the initiative \nsettled on a moderate target of serving 40 children and youth in licensed TFC homes by April 1, 2018.  \nOne of the reasons for the poor showing is the failure to take into account the best available \nevidence on the most effective methods for recruiting families who are willing and able to care for the \nmost challenging children. As early as 2002, the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (USDHHS) issued a set of evidence-based recommendations for foster-parent \nrecruitment. The key finding from the research was that most agencies use ineffective recruiting methods \nthat cast a wide net through public service announcements but fail to engage families who are willing to \ncare for older children with special needs. The report went on to say that states were underutilizing their \nmost effective recruitment tool – foster parent networks: “Foster parents are effective recruiters because \nthey share information about the need for foster parents through word-of-mouth contact and can promote \nthe idea of fostering just by their presence in the community.” (USDHHS, 2002: p. ii.).  \nThe latest 4-month status report submitted by the Department outlines a marketing strategy that \nincludes a brief “one pager” placed on the internet system/D-Net used by DCFS and providers. If there is \na marketing strategy that relies heavily on foster parent networks, it is not apparent from any of the TFC \nreports or logic models submitted by the Department (see below). The reason we draw attention to this \ndeficiency is not to indulge in “Monday-night quarter-backing,” but to re-emphasize that there is a science \nof implementation that can guard against such missteps.\n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 50 of 59 PageID #:2688\nI.

Learning whether children are better off because of DCFS involvement: Regenerations \nAnother initiative that preceded the appointment of the Expert Panel but later was \nincorporated into the B.H. Implementation Plan is Regenerations for dually involved youth. The \ngoal is to reduce the number of youth in care who are detained at the Cook County Juvenile \nTemporary Detention Center (JTDC), particularly those who are detained beyond their scheduled \nrelease date (RUR). The Regenerations project director participated in the Expert Panel’s \ncoaching sessions. The four-month status report is an excellent example of results-oriented \nmanagement and accountability. The rigorous evaluation that Chapin Hall designed for the \nproject is an exemplary illustration of the experimentalist approach and a model of what Sabel \nand Simon (2004) mean by transparency.  \nAs noted in the logic model below, the proximal outcome for judging success is the \nreduction in the average number of days youth spend in Cook County Juvenile Temporary \nDetention Center (JTDC). The comparison group consists of a matched sample of youth with \nsimilar characteristics to the intervention group formed by propensity score matching on \nprognostic factors. To qualify for matching, the youth had to appear on RUR lists sometime from \nFY2013 to FY2015 (i.e., before any Regenerations pilot activities began).   \nAs reported in the four-month status report, the Regenerations pilot served 70 youth in FY2017. \nOf these, 69 youth had known dates of RUR and the date of JTDC release. The average duration from the \ndate of RUR and JDTC release was 39.0 days and a median of 28 days.  This compares with an average \nof 19.9 days and a median of 6 days for the historical comparison group of 141 youth.   \nThe lengthier duration in detention experienced by the intervention youth after their scheduled \nrelease date compared to the historical comparison group should be viewed within the context of where \nthese youth went. Of the 70 youth served by Regenerations in FY2017, 45 youth (64.3%) had matching \nfamily or family-like placement records in SharePoint and DCFS CYCIS data. Of the 141 youth in the \nhistorical comparison group, only 40 youth (28.4%) were released to family or family-like settings. The \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 52 of 59 PageID #:2690\nmuch larger proportion of Regenerations’ youth who moved to less-restrictive, family-like settings \novershadows their 3-week longer length of stay in detention compared to the historical comparison group. \nOf course, the stability of these less restrictive placements is also of some consequence. For the larger \nproportion of intervention youth discharged to family settings, only 3 youth (6.7%) were stepped-up to \nresidential care after their placement in a family compared to 12 youth (30.0%) in the comparison group.  \nThe Expert Panel concurs with the assessment of the four-month status report that the \nRegenerations team has done an outstanding job in improving its reporting of logic model metrics from 3 \nin the previous four-month status report to 12 output metrics and 6 outcome metrics in the latest four-\nmonth status report. The Panel is satisfied with the outcomes of the pilot and recommends that future \nmonthly and four-month status reports contain only the Output and Outcomes sections of the template \nunless there is an indication from the output and outcome data that the previously achieved results are \nslipping.  \nThe Regenerations model has the potential to serve more dually involved youth in care in Cook \nCounty and in other areas of the state if the Department defines and describes specifically the goals, \ninterventions and methods that comprise the individual mentoring service that is a core component of the \nRegenerations model. In addition, the Department needs the capacity to collect and analyze the amount, \nfrequency, duration and per unit cost of each discrete service provided on a child-specific basis.   \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 53 of 59 PageID #:2691\n3 \n5\n7 \n1\n0\n2\n-\n8\n1\n-\n8\n \nl\ne\nd\no\nM\n \nc\ni\ng\no\nL\n \nt\no\nl\ni\nP\n/\nR\nU\nR\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\nn\ne\ng\ne\nR\n \nS\nF\nC\nD\n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 565 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 54 of 59 PageID #:2692\nIn conclusion, we have discussed our concerns and the bases for our recommendations \nwith the parties; therefore, we are hopeful that the parties agree with the recommendations and \nthat together we can agree on the actions needed going forward and the timeframes to address \nthem.

See Doc. No. 456.  The parties stipulated to the adm ission into\nevidence of the exhibits attached to Plaintiffs’ Motion, the Court heard the testimony of Defendant\nErwin McEwen, Director of the lIlinois Department of Children andF  amily Services, and the parties\npresented argument to the Court.\nBased on the evidence presented, and the testimony of Director McEwen, the Court finds that\nthe planned cuts in programs and services that DCFS is undertaking violate the B.H. Decree.  The\nCourt finds that Director McEwen is an extraordinarily credible and knowledgeable witness with\nan understanding of the multiple problems facing the system.  The Director’s testimony concerning\nthe harm that would occur to children under the program and service reductions that the Director\nwould have to m ake would violate the Consen t Decree in num erous ways.  Not only w ould\nnecessary services be eliminated or reduced, but the damage done would be irreparable.  The Court\nis persuaded by the Director’s testimony that the harm that would occur following the program and\nservice reductions that he described could not be restored in the short term once the cuts are made,\nand that the Decree violations that would be inevitable under the program and service cuts present\na certainty of irreparable harm.  \nFor these reasons, and as stated m ore fully in ope n court on Monday, June 29, IT IS\nHEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 461 Filed: 06/30/09 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:393\n1.

Defendant shall maintain current caseload ratios for investigative personnel, follow-\nup caseworkers, and supervisory staff, whether provided by DCFS or its contracted agencies.\n3. Defendant shall continue to provide fully adequate monitoring of service providers,\nand maintain current professional, artistic and University contracts, including without lim itation\ncontracts for training, assessments, Integrated Assessments, research, evaluation for demonstration\nprojects, and the monitoring of residential treatment centers and psychiatric hospitals performed by\nthe University of Illinois at Chicago.\n4. Defendant shall continue to perform all necessary clinical and social assessments for\nall children entering and assure that appropriate services are available to meet the assessed needs.\n5. Defendant shall submit a written descriptiono f any reductions in programs, services,\nand staffing no fewer than 14 days prior to the implementation of same for review by Plaintiffs.

The requirements of this Paragraph shall terminate upon passage of\nan FY 2010 budget.\n6. On or before July 1, 2009, Defendant shall publish this Order by (i) posting it on\nDCFS’ website, and (ii) by transmission of a copy of the Order to its personnel, to foster parents,\nand to contractors and providers of services, including any that received prior notice of a reduction\nin compensation or termination of a contract resulting from budget limitations via e-mail where\navailable and by such other, additional means as the Department employs for communications to the\nforegoing persons and entities in its usual course of business.  \n-2-\n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 461 Filed: 06/30/09 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:394\n7.

Now, after this court dismissed his appeal of the second\ndenial of intervention and after the two original parties entered a consent decree that the\ndistrict judge approved as fair, reasonable and adequate, Mr. Murphy appeals both\ndistrict court orders denying his motions to intervene and also challenges the fairness\nand adequacy of the consent decree. We dismiss Mr. Murphy's appeal for lack of\njurisdiction on grounds of untimeliness and because, with respect to the decree, he lacks\nstanding to challenge the district court's rulings.I.\n2 The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) is the state agency\nresponsible for providing protective and welfare services to abused and neglected\nchildren and their families. The plaintiffs here--a class of all children who have been or\nwill be in the custody of the DCFS and placed by it somewhere other than with their\nbiological parents--filed suit in June of 1988 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst the Director of the DCFS.1 They asserted that various DCFS actions violated their\nright to adequate and safe placements and care under the Fourteenth Amendment, 42\n1 of 4 12/8/2008 7:20 PM\n\n984 F.2d 196 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/984/984.F2d.196.92-1136.html\nU.S.C. § 1983 and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §§\n« up\n620-28, 670-79(a).\n3 On May 30, 1989, the district court granted in part and denied in part DCFS's motion to\ndismiss the action. B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F.Supp. 1387 (N.D.Ill.1989). Specifically, the\ncourt held that the plaintiffs stated valid claims under the Fourteenth Amendment for\nviolations of their constitutional right \"to be free from arbitrary intrusions upon their\nphysical and emotional well-being while directly or indirectly in state custody, and to be\nprovided with adequate food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and minimally adequate\ntraining to secure these basic constitutional rights.\" Id. at 1405. The court also\ndetermined that the plaintiffs set forth a proper claim for violations of the Adoption\nAssistance and Child Welfare Act's case plan and case review requirements, but\ndismissed the plaintiffs' equal protection claims, their due process claims for violation of\nstate statutory provisions and their remaining substantive due process claims. Id.\n4 After extensive discovery over the course of two years, the parties agreed in August\n1990 to the district judge's suggestion that they work toward settlement with the help of\ncourt-appointed experts who would assess DCFS's procedures and recommend\nimprovements. The settlement process, conducted pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n706,2 culminated in the consent decree, which the district court approved on December\n20, 1991. This document imposes detailed requirements upon the DCFS in areas ranging\nfrom case management and case planning to assessments and accountability.\n5 Mr. Murphy, meanwhile, was not satisfied with how the case was proceeding. He\ncontended that his status as guardian ad litem for thousands of children in the juvenile\ncourt system gave him a substantial interest in the proceedings and justified his\nparticipation. Under the Juvenile Court Act of Illinois, a guardian ad litem must be\nappointed upon the filing in state court of a petition alleging child abuse or neglect,\nJuvenile Court Act § 2-17, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 37, § 802-17 (1990), and Mr. Murphy serves in\nthat role in the Cook County juvenile court system. In September 1990 he filed a motion\nto intervene in this case, complaining that the counsel for the plaintiffs' class were\ninadequately representing them. The district court denied the motion, holding that Mr.\nMurphy failed to demonstrate a direct interest or to explain why his expertise was\nessential to resolution of the case. The court also based its denial on timeliness grounds,\nnoting that intervention at that stage in the settlement process \"would clearly be\ndisruptive.\" Transcript of Proceedings of Nov. 7, 1990, at 9. Mr. Murphy did not appeal.3\n6 Mr. Murphy again moved to intervene on April 24, 1991, on essentially the same\ngrounds offered in his first motion. When the district court denied that motion, he\nappealed to this court, which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on July 8, 1991.\nMr. Murphy now appeals both district court orders denying his motions to intervene; he\nalso challenges the district judge's orders entering the consent decree and denying his\nmotions to compel discovery, to expand distribution of notice and to request an\nevidentiary hearing and continuance of the fairness hearing.\nII.\n7 We turn first to the timeliness of Mr. Murphy's appeal of the denial of his motions to\nintervene. Appeals must be filed within thirty days after the date of entry of the judgment\nor order appealed from. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). Mr. Murphy filed this appeal on January\n16, 1992. Thus, this appeal's challenge of the district judge's November 7, 1990, denial of\nintervention--an immediately appealable order--is untimely. Similarly, Mr. Murphy's\nappeal of the denial (on April 26, 1991) of his second motion to intervene (a virtual carbon\ncopy of the first) also is untimely. Even if the present appeal of the April 26, 1991, order\nwere filed within the thirty-day time period, this court has already considered and\n2 of 4 12/8/2008 7:20 PM\n\n984 F.2d 196 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/984/984.F2d.196.92-1136.html\ndismissed that appeal in July of 1991 and Mr. Murphy cannot attempt to revive it now.\n« up\n8 Mr. Murphy argues that the present appeal is not untimely because this court's July\n1991 dismissal of his earlier appeal instructed him to wait until the end of the case. That\ncontention is unfounded. We based that dismissal on the untimeliness of the appeal--\nnamely, Mr. Murphy's improper attempt, by filing a virtually identical intervention\nmotion, to circumvent his failure to appeal the first motion's denial within the required\ntime. See Order of July 8, 1991, at 2. An order denying intervention is final and\nappealable. Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, 513, 70 S.Ct. 322,\n325, 94 L.Ed. 299 (1950); United States v. City of Oakland, 958 F.2d 300, 302 (9th\nCir.1992); see also 7C Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1923, at 508 (1986 & Supp.1991). By necessity such an\norder is subject to immediate review, because denial of intervention precludes the\nproposed intervenor's ability to appeal the later judgment (and at that time to challenge\nthe earlier denial of intervention). See Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action,\n480 U.S. 370, 378, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 1183, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987); City of Oakland, 958 F.2d\nat 302. Although we noted in the order dismissing the appeal of July 1991 that parties can\nwait until the case's conclusion and appeal from the final decision, see Order of July 8,\n1991, at 2, this option is limited to parties or successful intervenors; neither of these\nterms describes the Public Guardian. By definition, an order denying intervention cannot\nbe appealed by a party or by a successful intervenor. Such an order is \"interlocutory\" in\nthe sense that it is entered during the course of the litigation and prior to final judgment\nin the entire case; in all other respects, however, it is final and must be appealed within\n30 days or not at all. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Murphy's untimely\nappeal of the denials of intervention.\n9 Turning to Mr. Murphy's other complaints about the district court's rulings--most\nnotably the court's approval of the consent decree--we find it unnecessary to reach the\nmerits because Mr. Murphy, a non-party, lacks standing to challenge those rulings. As\nthe Supreme Court stated in Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629\n(1988), \"[t]he rule that only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties,\nmay appeal an adverse judgment, is well settled.\" Id. at 304, 108 S.Ct. at 587; see also\nKarcher v. May, 484 U.S. 72, 77, 108 S.Ct. 388, 391, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987) (\"[W]e have\nconsistently applied the general rule that one who is not a party or has not been treated\nas a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom.\") (citations omitted). In the\ncontext of consent decrees, we have stated more specifically that parties whose motions\nto intervene were properly denied \"have no right to attack the fairness of the consent\ndecree because they are not parties to the agreement.\" United States v. City of Chicago,\n908 F.2d 197, 200 (7th Cir.1990), cert. denied sub nom. Feldman v. United States, --- U.S.\n----, 111 S.Ct. 783, 112 L.Ed.2d 846 (1991). Because Mr. Murphy is not a party in this case\nand has failed to intervene successfully, he has no standing to now challenge the district\ncourt's order entering the consent decree or its denial of motions to expand distribution\nof notice, to compel discovery or to request an evidentiary hearing and a continuance of\nthe fairness hearing.\n10 Mr. Murphy's untimely appeal of the denial of his motions to intervene makes it\nunnecessary to determine whether those motions were properly denied. Even if we had\njurisdiction to consider Mr. Murphy's requests for intervention, however, we would not\nbe persuaded that the district court erred in denying those motions. Mr. Murphy sought\nto intervene as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or,\nalternatively, to intervene permissively pursuant to Rule 24(b). Only abuse of discretion\nmay upset the district court's denial of permissive intervention. In that respect, there are\nfour relevant factors: timely application, an interest relating to the subject matter of the\naction, potential impairment of that interest by disposition of the action and lack of\n3 of 4 12/8/2008 7:20 PM\n\n984 F.2d 196 http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/984/984.F2d.196.92-1136.html\nadequate representation of the interest by the existing parties. See Southmark Corp. v.\n« up\nCagan, 950 F.2d 416, 418 (7th Cir.1991). Abuse of discretion is also the standard for\nevaluating the court's denial of intervention of right on grounds of untimeliness. City of\nChicago, 908 F.2d at 199. Given the ample grounds for concluding that the case and the\nsettlement negotiations had sufficiently progressed to warrant the district court's\npreclusion of interventions,4 the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nintervention solely on grounds of timeliness. Thus, that conclusion justifies denial of Mr.\nMurphy's motions to intervene, whether permissive or as a matter of right.\n11 An examination of the other three factors--which are reviewed de novo if the\nintervention is of right--might arguably be more favorable for Mr. Murphy than is\ntimeliness. Success on any or all of these factors does not trump untimeliness, however.\nSee Keith v. Daley, 764 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980, 106\nS.Ct. 383, 88 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985) (stating that the failure to establish one of the four\nelements requires denial of the motion to intervene). As a result, even if the jurisdictional\ndefect did not obviate this inquiry, Mr. Murphy has failed to demonstrate that the district\ncourt erroneously denied his motions to intervene.\nIII.\n12 Because we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider Mr. Murphy's appeal of the denial of\nhis motions to intervene, and because Mr. Murphy lacks standing to challenge the district\ncourt's other rulings, the appeal is DISMISSED.\n1 The Director at the time of the action, Sue Suter, was sued in her official capacity. She has since\nbeen replaced by Acting Director Sterling M. Ryder, who accordingly takes her place in this action\n2 Rule 706 allows the court to appoint expert witnesses. On August 31, 1990, the court entered an\nagreed order appointing 13 experts to review ten substantive areas of the lawsuit and two people\nto manage the process\n3 Instead, Mr. Murphy sought to amend his complaint in another case, K.H. v. Suter, No. 87 C 9833\n(N.D.Ill.1987), an individual damages action that the Public Guardian brought on behalf of a\nDCFS ward. The district judge in that case denied leave to amend\n4 In the Transcript of Proceedings of Nov. 7, 1990, Judge Grady stated that\n[t]his is certainly not an ancient case, but I think timeliness has more to do with how much is over\nthe dam by way of accomplishment in the case than it does the mere lapse of time. In this case,\nmuch has been accomplished, and at the suggestion of the Court, the parties have agreed upon a\nmechanism which could well result in the settlement of the case....\nHe later continued:\nBut, clearly, Mr. Murphy is not in sympathy with the plan of litigation which the Court and\ncounsel have adopted in an effort to resolve the complex issues in this case in the most efficient\nmanner possible. Intervention in that state of affairs would clearly be disruptive as far as that\nprocedure is concerned. Therefore, the Court would be reluctant to permit intervention even if Mr.\nMurphy had a protectable interest and the representation of the class by existing counsel were\ninadequate.\nSee Transcript of Proceedings of Nov. 7, 1990, at 8-9.\nCC∅ | TRANSFORMED BY PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG\n4 of 4 12/8/2008 7:20 PM",

SS 1983 and\n1988 and 28 U.S.C. SS 2201 e_t seq. , on their own behalf and on\nbehalf of all others similarly situated because of alleged\nviolations by defendant of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare\nAct,of 1980, 42 U.S.C. SS 620-28, 670-79U) (the \"AAA\").\nPARTIES\nAt the time this lawsuit was filed, named plaintiffs\nB.H., C.H., J.S., C.Z., E.G., O.G., S.G., C.G., P.G. and A.G.\nwere children who had been removed from their homes and placed in\nthe custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family\nServices  (the \"Department\" or \"DCFS\").  They ranged in age from 2\nto 17 years old.  On February 22, 1989, this Court issued an\n\norder certifying a plaintiff class, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2), consisting of all persons who, on or after the date of\ncommencement of this action, are in the custody of DCFS and have\nbeen placed somewhere other than with their parents.\nDefendant Sue Suter is the Director of DCFS and is sued\nin her official capacity.\nPLAINTIFFS' COMPLAINT\nPlaintiffs filed a Complaint, Amended Complaint and\nSecond Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs alleged that they are\nplaced  in DCFS custody because of alleged abuse, neglect or\ndependency.  While in DCFS custody, plaintiffs alleged that they\nare repeatedly subjected by DCFS to serious damage to their\nmental health, development and physical well-being because DCFS\nfails to provide them with safe and stable placements, shuffles\nmany children among six or more temporary living arrangements,\nfails to provide appropriate services to prevent removal from\ntheir homes or reunify them with their families, warehouses them\nin violervt and overcrowded shelters and psychiatric hospitals,\nand places them in foster homes where many of them are victims of\nthe very kinds of abuse and neglect which prompted them to be\nremoved from their homes.  Plaintiffs also alleged that DCFS\nfailed to provide them with adequate medical and mental health\ncare, education, shelter, clothing and food.  Plaintiffs asserted\nthat these actions by defendant violated their rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment and the AAA.\n\nDefendant moved to dismiss this action  in its entirety,\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. I2(b)(6).  In an order and memorandum\nopinion dated May 30, 1989, B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387\n(N.D. 111. 1989) (Grady, J.), this Court granted  in part and\ndenied in part defendant's motion with respect to plaintiffs'\nAmended Complaint.  The Court held that plaintiffs' allegations\nset forth a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment for violations\nof plaintiffs' constitutional rights to be \"free from\nunreasonable or unwarranted  intrusions upon their physical and\nemotional well being while directly and indirectly  in state\ncustody, and to be provided by the state with adequate food,\nshelter, clothing and medical care, and minimally adequate\ntraining to secure these basic constitutional rights\" as\ndetermined by the exercise of accepted professional judgment,\npractice or standards.  Id. at 1396.  The Court also held that\nplaintiffs had stated a claim for violations of the case plan and\ncase review requirements under Title IV-E of the Adoption\nAssistance Act, 42 U.S.C. S$ 67l(a)(16), 675(1),  (5), but the\nCour^ rejected plaintiffs' procedural due process claims relating\nto alleged liberty interests arising under state law, plaintiffs'\nequal protection claims, and certain of plaintiffs' claims\narising under the AAA,  including plaintiffs' claims to\n\"reasonable efforts\" to prevent  the need for placement and to\nreunify plaintiffs with their families under 42 U.S.C.\nS 671(a)(15).  Following the issuance of the Court's Memorandum\nOpinion and Order, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.\n3\n\nOn November  16, 1990, plaintiffs filed a motion to\nreconsider dismissal of their claims to \"reasonable efforts\" to\nprevent placement and reunify them with.their families in light\nof the decision  in Artist M. v. Johnson, 917 F.2d 980 (7th Cir.\n1990), cert, granted, No. 90-1488 (May 13, 1991).  On December\n12, 1991, the Court, without ruling specifically on the merits of\nplaintiffs' motion, granted plaintiffs leave to amend the Second\nAmended Complaint to add claims based on DCFS's alleged failure\nto make \"reasonable efforts\" under the AAA.  As of the date of\nthis Decree, the Supreme Court had not- ruled on the pending\nappeal of the Artist M. decision.  Notwithstanding  this\nuncertainty as to the state of the law, the parties have entered\ninto this Decree, and the parties acknowledge that final\ndisposition of the issues raised by the Artist M. case will not\nbe a basis for modification of this Decree.\nDefendant has denied and continues to deny the\nallegations contained  in plaintiffs1 Complaint, Amended Complaint\nand Second Amended Complaint  as amended, particularly all legal\ncontentions that any alleged policies or practices have violated\nany law.\nSETTLEMENT PROCESS\nAfter extensive discovery, and on the suggestion of\nthis Court, the parties agreed to stay further discovery and try\nto settle the case.  On August  31, 1990 this Court, pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Evidence 706, entered an agreed order appointing\n\n13 experts to review ten substantive areas of the lawsuit, as set\nforth in the terms of the order.  The Court also appointed two\nindividuals, Joseph T. Monahan and Donald M. Hallberg, to serve\nas managers of the process.\nOn October 31, 1990, the parties received reports\ncontaining  the findings and recommendations of the experts, as\nwell as the report of the managers.  On the basis of these\nreports and the extensive discovery  in this matter, the parties\nengaged  in extensive settlement negotiations  in an effort to\navoid the burden, costs and inherent risks of further litigation.\nBased on these considerations, and following the review of the\nterms of this Decree and consultation with various persons\ninvolved  in the child welfare system, plaintiffs and defendant\nhave determined  that it is in the interests of the certified\nclass and the public interest to settle this action with the\nentry of this Decree.\nThis Decree is the result of a compromise and\nsettlemen-t and is not a determination of liability.  Nothing\nherein shall be considered an admission of fault of any kind by\ndefendant, nor shall anything herein be considered a reflection\nof any weakness of proof by plaintiffs.\nHaving carefully reviewed this Decree, the parties\nbeing  in agreement hereto, and the Court being fully advised of\nthe premises, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:\nDBFINITIQMS\n1.

It is the purpose of this Decree to assure that\nDCFS provides children with at least minimally adequate care.\nDefendant agrees that, for the purposes of this Decree, DCFS's\nresponsibility to provide such care for plaintiffs includes an\nobligation to create and maintain a system which assures children\nare treated in conformity with the following standards of care:\na.  Children shall be free from foreseeable and\npreventable physical harm.\nb.  Children shall receive at least minimally\nadequate food, shelter and clothing.\nc.

In order to meet this standard of care, it shall be\nnecessary for DCFS to create and maintain a system which:\na.  provides that children will be timely and\nstably placed  in safe and appropriate living arrangements;\nb.  provides that reasonable efforts, as\ndetermined based on individual circumstances  (including\nconsideration of whether no efforts would be reasonable) shall be\nmade to prevent removal of children from their homes and stably\nto reunite children with their parents, where appropriate and\nconsistent with the best interests of the child;\nc.  provides that if children are not to be\nreunited with their parents, DCFS shall promptly identify and\ntake the steps within its power to achieve permanency for the\nchild  in the least restrictive setting possible;\nd.  provides for the prompt identification of the\nmedical, mental health and developmental needs of children;\ne.  provides timely access to adequate medical,\nmental health and developmental services;\nf.  provides that while in DCFS custody children\nreceive a public education of a kind and quality comparable to\nother children not in DCFS custody;\ng.  provides that while in DCFS custody children\nreceive such services and training as necessary to permit them to\nfunction in the least restrictive and most homelike setting\npossible; and\n10\n\nh.  provides that children receive adequate\nservices to assist in the transition to adulthood.\n6.  Plaintiffs\" cause of action alleged deficiencies in\nDCFS policies and practices generally.  This Decree is intended\nto address only claims arising from said cause of action.\nPlaintiffs did not complain of isolated deprivations of adequate\ncare and services.  No class member is permitted to enforce this\nDecree based solely on isolated instances of non-compliance with\nthe standards described in paragraphs 4-5 above or with any other\nprovisions in this Decree.\nPROTECTIVE SERVICES AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT\n7.  Initial Assessment.  By July 1, 1993, DCFS shall\nperform initial social assessments under the circumstances\ndescribed below as veil as risk assessments and investigations of\nfamilies that are the subject of pending abuse or neglect\nreports.  Such social assessments shall be performed as soon as\npractical once a caseworker begins to consider removal of the\nchild from the home and, in all cases, in time for any shelter\ncare hearing in the case.  Nothing in this paragraph vill require\nDCFS to refrain from taking protective custody where there is\nreason to believe that the child is in imminent danger to his or\nher life or health.  Such initial social assessments shall\ninclude a preliminary assessment of the child and family\nsufficient to (i) permit DCFS to identify reasonable efforts, if\nany, that can be made to address allegations of abuse and neglect\nand keep a family intact; (ii) identify any needs of an emergency\n11\n\nnature (including food and clothing); (iii) commence to identify\nand preliminarily select appropriate family and relative\nresources to keep a family intact or, if the family cannot be\nkept intact, preliminarily select appropriate placement\nresources.\n8.  Reasonable Efforts to Prevent Placement.  As of the\ndate of the entry of this Order, DCFS shall not remove a child\nfrom a parent or continue the removal by another person\nauthorized to take protective custody under state law unless the\nstandard set forth in 111. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, 1 2055 is met, and\nunless DCFS has made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate\nthe need for removal of the child.  \"Reasonable efforts\" as used\nin this paragraph and paragraph 7 means such efforts to preserve\nthe family as are consistent with good social work practice based\non the individual circumstances of the case and the best  interest\nof the child, and may include but are not limited to the offer\nand provision of appropriate family preservation services from\namong those listed at 111. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, f 2058.2.  In\ncertain  instances, it may be that, due to the individual\ncircumstances of the case and the best  interests of the child, no\nefforts reasonably can be made to preserve the family.  Nothing\nin this paragraph will require DCFS to refrain from taking\nprotective custody if there is reason to believe the child is in\nimminent danger to his or her life or health.\n12\n\n9.  Documentation of Reasons for Protective Custody and\nReasonable Efforts.  By January 1, 1993, when DCFS receives\ntemporary custody of a child, DCFS shall document the reasons why\ncustody was taken and the efforts that were made, if any, to\nprevent the need for removal.  The form of this documentation\nshall be determined in accordance with the procedure set forth in\nparagraph 41 below.\n10.  Elimination of Interim Service Teams.  By July 1,\n1993, DCFS will eliminate and not reinstate the Interim Service\nTeam approach to initial case staffing.\n11.  Pre-Placement Resource Referral Information.  By\nJuly 1, 1992, DCFS will develop resource referral information\naccessible to all direct service staff identifying the services\navailable to serve children and families in each region.  This\ninformation shall be reviewed continually and updated at least\nannually.\n12.  Abuse and Neglect Reports on Children Already in\nDCFS Custody.  By July 1, 1992, when a child is reported to DCFS\nas having been abused or neglected while in placement —  whether\nby the foster parent, caretaker, or any other person in the\nplacement —  DCFS shall ensure that the parent of the alleged\nabuse or neglect victim and all DCFS caseworkers or case managers\nresponsible for the alleged victim and for any other children in\nthe placement are promptly notified when the report has been\nmade, when an investigation is pending and when such report is\n\"indicated\" or \"unfounded,\" within the meaning of 111. Rev. stat.\n13\n\nch. 23, 12053.  if such a report has been indicated, DCFS shall\npromptly notify licensing staff to initiate a review of the\nlicensing status of the placement and shall ensure that all\nappropriate personnel, when making placement decisions, are\ninformed that a report has been indicated  involving the\nplacement.  The quality assurance unit shall evaluate the\ninvestigation and disposition of such reports and shall submit a\nreport on such abuse or neglect reports as provided in paragraph\n62 below of this Decree.  The Administrative Case Reviewer\nresponsible for reviewing the case plans of the children involved\nshall be notified of all such reports and findings and, where\nappropriate, shall initiate an Administrative Case Review as\nprovided in paragraph 24 below of this Order to assure that\nappropriate adjustments to the case plan are made.\nSCREENINGS AND ASSESSMENTS FOR CHILDREN\n13.  Initial Health Screening.\na.  By July 1, 1993, DCFS shall ensure that within\n24 hours of entering DCFS protective custody, all children will\nreceive an initial health screening by a physician or other\nprovider qualified under Illinois law to furnish primary medical\nand health services.  The initial health screening shall be of\nsufficient scope to permit DCFS to ascertain enough about the\ncurrent health of the child to identify (i) any health needs\nrequiring immediate attention, and (ii) any health information\nneeded to make an informed placement decision.\n14\n\nb.  Whenever possible this initial health\nscreening should include an effective professionally acceptable\nscreening such as the program described under Sections 5122 and\n5123.2 of the HCFA Program Manual Governing Early and Periodic\nScreening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services (\"EPSDT\"), dated\nApril 1990 (hereinafter referred to as \"EPSDT Standards\").  If it\nis not possible to provide a complete screening as described in\nthis subparagraph vithin 24 hours of DCFS protective custody or\nif the circumstances under which protective custody is taken do\nnot warrant such a screening, this more complete screening shall\nin all cases be performed no later than 48 hours after the\ntemporary custody hearing is held under 111. Rev. Stat. ch. 37,\nft 802-9, 802-10.\n14.  Comprehensive Assessment.\na.  By July 1, 1994, DCFS will ensure that all\nchildren receive a comprehensive assessment sufficient to permit\nthe child's follow-up caseworker to develop an appropriate case\nplan as described below at paragraphs 15-17. The assessment shall\nbe completed sufficiently in advance of the case plan to\nincorporate the contents of the assessment into the case plan.\nThe components of this comprehensive assessment shall all be\nperformed by qualified personnel.  This comprehensive assessment\nshall consist of at least the following:\n(1)  all appropriate diagnostic studies to\nevaluate the child's health, including physical, dental or\nmental illnesses or conditions discovered or indicated by\n15\n\nthe initial screening examination described  in paragraph 13\nabove;\n(2)  a completion of the medical and\nimmunization history of the child and, where available,\nrelevant medical history of the child's parents;\n(3)  a social assessment of the child's\nfamily, including family history, location of absent or non-\ncustodial parents and other relatives and their relationship\nto the family, and an assessment of the appropriateness of\nfamily reunification as a permanency goal and the steps\nnecessary to achieve reunification;\n(4)  if indicated by any other component of\nthe assessment, a preliminary, age-appropriate substance\nabuse screening of the child;\n(5)  a basic educational assessment  including\nidentification of the child's current school and grade\nlevel; the child's educational history; and  identification\nof any educational goals and needs including the need for\nany further educational testing or assessments;\n(6)  a developmental screen on all children\nnot yet of school age; and\n(7)  a basic mental health screening and, if\nindicated or recommended  in the exercise of professional\njudgment, more intensive evaluations.\nAny of the above may be omitted  if a person administering an\nassessment provides documentation that he or she is informed of\n16\n\nthe results of a recent equivalent  evaluation.  The written\nresults of the comprehensive  assessment may be received after\npreparation of the case plan, but, absent clinical necessity, all\nsuch results shall be received within 60 days after DCFS\nprotective custody.  Results can be received after the\npreparation of the case plan only  if and only to the extent that\nsuch delay  is the result of clinical necessity or earlier receipt\nis not necessary for the case plan.\nb.  By July 1, 1993, DCFS will ensure that all\nchildren receive an assessment  sufficiently  in advance of the\ncase plan to incorporate the contents of the assessment  into the\ncase plan which assessment  shall consist of at least the\nfollowing:\n(1)  compilation  of the medical and\nimmunization  history of the child and, where available,\nrelevant medical history of the child's parents;\n(2)  a social assessment of the child's\nfamily,  including  family history,  location of absent or non-\ncustodial parents and other relatives and their relationship\nto the family, and an assessment of the appropriateness of\nfamily reunification as a permanency goal and the steps\nnecessary to achieve reunification; and\n(3)  a basic educational assessment  including\nidentification of the child's current school and grade\nlevel; the child's educational history; and  identification\n17\n\nof any educational goals and needs including the need for\nany further educational testing or assessments.\nAny of the above may be omitted if a person administering an\nassessment provides documentation that he or she is informed of\nthe results of a recent equivalent evaluation.  The written\nresults of this assessment may be received after preparation of\nthe case plan, but in no event more than 60 days after DCFS\nprotective custody.  Results can be received after the\npreparation of the case plan only if and only to the extent that\nsuch delay is not the result of clinical necessity or earlier\nreceipt  is not necessary for the case plan.\nc.  Nothing in this section will be construed to\nabridge DCFS's obligation to obtain the consent of the child, his\nor her parents or a court order to conduct such assessments where\nsuch consent would otherwise be necessary.\nd.  By January 1, 1994, for children already in\nDCFS custody or guardianship prior to the time the comprehensive\nassessment system described  in paragraph (a) is implemented, DCFS\nwill complete a reviev of all such children to determine whether\nDCFS lacks any of the information that would be provided by any\nof the assessments described  in paragraph (a) and, where such\ninformation  is lacking, DCFS shall provide such assessments.\nCASE PLANS AND PBRMANENCY GOALS\n15.  Case Plan.\na.  By January 1, 1992, DCFS shall ensure that a\nwritten case plan is developed for all children within 30 days\n18\n\nafter entering DCFS temporary custody, and, in all cases, within\n35 days after protective custody.\nb.  After the effective dates in paragraphs 13 and\n14 above, the case plan shall be based on the results of the\nhealth screening and comprehensive assessment described therein,\nand, if appropriate, shall be revised to reflect the results of\nany follow-up assessments or other subsequent assessments of the\nchild. The case plan shall be developed by the follow-up\ncaseworker following discussions or consultation with the child\n(if old enough), parents (including discussion and consideration\nof the parents' concerns with the parents' portion of the plan),\nfoster parents or other placement provider, the child's teacher,\nand any professionals who conducted the medical screening or\ncomprehensive assessment.  The purpose of such consultations\nshall be to both solicit the information and views of the persons\ncontacted and to attempt to build support among them for the\nevolving case plan.

If objections are\nsubmitted, the parties and the monitor shall meet  in an effort to\nresolve any disagreements  regarding the proposed modification.\nIf, within 10 days from the receipt of any objections, the\nparties and the monitor are unable to reach an agreement as to\nthe issues raised, the monitor, within 10 days after such an\nimpasse has been reached, shall submit to the Court his or her\nrecommendations as to the resolution of the disputed  issue.  The\nparties may submit within 5 days a response to the monitor's\nproposal.  The Court will then determine whether the plan shall\nbe modified and in what manner.  The parties may agree to alter\nany of the deadlines set forth in this paragraph.\n73.  Monitoring Compliance with this Decree.  The\nmonitor shall receive from DCFS sufficient  information to permit\nthe monitor to evaluate the status of DCFS's compliance with this\nDecree and the monitor shall report his or her findings to the\n62\n\nparties and the Court on a regular basis.  The obligations vill\nbe discharged in the following manner:\na.  Defendant shall provide information regarding\ncompliance with this Decree, the Implementation Plan and the\nAnnual Plans to the monitor and class counsel for plaintiffs on a\nsemi-annual basis commencing on September 30, 1992 (the \"Semi-\nAnnual Reports\").  On or before July 1, 1992, the parties and the\nmonitor will jointly develop a set of categories of measurable\ninformation to assist in evaluating the quality of care provided\nto children.  To the extent possible, the monitor and the parties\nwill endeavor to use these categories to develop standards to\nevaluate compliance with this Decree. The content and format of\nthe Semi-Annual Reports shall be determined by the same process\ngoverning the development of implementation and annual plans set\nforth in paragraph 73a above, and shall, whenever appropriate, be\ndesigned to use and not to duplicate data, information, reports\nor quality assurance mechanisms already used by DCFS, required by\nstate or federal lav, or provided for under the terms of other\ncourt orders.\nb.  In addition to the Semi-Annual Report, but\nconsistent with the considerations in subparagraph a, the monitor\nmay at any time make reasonable requests for additional reports\nor information.

In the event that the monitor or the\nplaintiffs assert that the Department is or is likely to be out\nof compliance with any of the terms of this Decree, the\nImplementation Plan or an Annual Plan, they shall so notify the\nDepartment.  Following receipt of such notice, the parties and\nthe monitor shall meet in an attempt to reach agreement on the\nextent, if any, of noncompliance or likely noncompliance and to\nprepare a plan for achieving compliance.  In the event the\nparties and the monitor agree on a plan for compliance, it will\nbe submitted to the Court and, subject to the Court's approval,\nwill be incorporated into this Decree.  In the event agreement is\n64\n\nnot reached, plaintiffs or the monitor, together or separately,\nmay seek compliance or any other appropriate relief from this\nCourt.  Where plaintiffs or the monitor conclude that the\nImplementation Plan or an Annual Plan previously approved\npursuant to the provisions of paragraph 71 is inconsistent with\nthe provisions of this Decree, the mere fact of such approval\nshall not preclude plaintiffs or the monitor from seeking relief\nunder this paragraph.\ne.  As provided in paragraph 6 of this Decree, no\nclass member is permitted to enforce this Decree based solely on\nisolated instances of non-compliance.\n74.  Terminating the Monitoring Process.

Modification of This Decree.  Any party may\npetition the Court to modify the terms of this Decree.  A party\nseeking modification will provide to the monitor and the other\n65\n\nparty a written description of the proposed modification and a\nstatement of the reasons for the modification.  The parties and\nthe monitor shall attempt to agree on any proposed modification\nand, if such agreement is reached, shall jointly seek the\napproval of the Court for the proposed modification.  if the\nparties and the monitor are unable to reach agreement, the party\nseeking modification may file a motion with the Court.

The teleconference participants will discuss progress on each \ninitiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, including barriers encountered and potential \nsolutions.  Bi-weekly conferences will be conducted in person when practicable.  It is expected \nthat there will be an in person meeting approximately once every six weeks, but meetings may be \nmore or less frequent depending on need.  \n \n1 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 530 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:995\n  3.    Second, to facilitate productive discussions at the bi-weekly teleconferences, \nDCFS will provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  The monthly \nreports will detail the specific steps that have been taken regarding actual implementation of each \ninitiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers that exist \nand strategies to eliminate or resolve the barriers and a comparison to the planned results as \ndocumented in the Implementation Plan.  The template for the monthly reports was developed \nwith the input of the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ Counsel and follows a “managing for \noutcomes” framework.  [See Exhibit A, attached.]   The parties recognize that, based on \nfeedback from the Expert Panel, DCFS may amend or modify the attached template with respect \nto particular projects or initiatives as necessary.   \n  4.  The parties recognize that from time to time, the Expert Panel may need to review \ninformation beyond that which directly relates to the specific initiatives described in the \nImplementation Plan.  For example, the Expert Panel has proposed, and the Department has \nagreed, that a study should be done for the more than 300 youth who have been stepped down \nfrom residential care in recent months to determine where those children have been placed, \nwhether they are receiving needed services (and if not, the barriers preventing same), and \nconducting planning to address these and other children’s needs in the interim timeframe before \nfull implementation of needed reforms has occurred.   DCFS will endeavor to proactively \nprovide such information to the Expert Panel in accordance with the Order dated October 20, \n2015.  [Dkt. 507].      \n  5.   Nothing in this Communication Plan shall be construed to limit the Experts from \nrequesting additional meetings, teleconferences or communications.  Nor shall it be construed to \nlimit the Experts’ current authority to request implementation-related information from the \n \n2 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 530 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:996\nDepartment (whether in written form or otherwise), or the Department’s or Plaintiffs’ ability to \nraise matters in consultation with the Experts.   \n6.  DCFS will continue to use the Share Point site to upload documents that may be \nrequested by the Experts or the Plaintiffs, or that DCFS believes the Experts may want to review.  \n \n              SO ORDERED \n \n \n \n9/28/16            _________________________ \n              Jorge L.

In essence, theirs is a motion to enforce a consent decree \nentered by Judge Grady on December 20, 1991 and restated on July 15, 1997.  For the reasons \nset forth below, the Court denies the motion [600]. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \n  In the late 1980’s, plaintiffs, who were children removed from their homes and placed in \nthe custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Service (“DCFS”), filed this suit.  \nThey alleged that they had been removed from their families and then subjected to further harm \nand abuse when DCFS failed to place them in safe and stable living situations.  The parties \nreached a settlement, in the form of a consent decree, which was approved and entered by Judge \nGrady.  That decree has been altered over the years, and the parties agree that the restated \nconsent decree is located at Docket 456-2.   \n  The restated consent decree states, in relevant part: \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:4772\nDEFINITIONS \n \n  1.  As used herein the following terms have the following meanings: \n*   *   * \n    e.  “Child,” “children,” “class members” or “plaintiffs” all \nmean solely members of the class certified by this Court’s order dated February \n22, 1989, and defined as all persons who, on or after the date of commencement \nof this action, are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and \nFamily Services and who have been placed somewhere other than with their \nparents. \n*   *   * \nDISCLAIMER \n*   *   * \n  3.  This Decree shall apply only to those persons who are members of \nthe plaintiff class.  This Decree creates no rights in favor of any other person and \ncreates no obligations or duties on the part of defendant beyond the terms of this \nDecree. \n*   *   * \nPURPOSE OF DECREE AND STANDARD OF CARE FOR CLASS \nMEMBERS \n \n  4.  It is the purpose of this Decree to assure that DCFS provides \nchildren with at least minimally adequate care.  Defendant agrees that, for \npurposes of this Decree, DCFS’s responsibility to provide such care for plaintiffs \nincludes an obligation to create and maintain a system which assures children are \ntreated in conformity with the following standards of care: \n \n    a.  Children shall be free from foreseeable and preventable \nphysical harm. \n*   *   * \n  5.  In order to meet this standard of care, it shall be necessary for \nDCFS to create and maintain a system which: \n \n    a.  provides that children will be timely and stably placed in \nsafe and appropriate living arrangements; \n \n    b.  provides that reasonable efforts, as determined based on \nindividual circumstances (including consideration of whether no efforts would be \nreasonable) shall be made to prevent removal of children from their homes and \nstably to reunite children with their parents, where appropriate and consistent with \nthe best interests of the child; \n*   *   * \nPROTECTIVE SERVICES AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT \n*   *   * \n  8.  Reasonable Efforts to Prevent Placement.  As of the date of the \nentry of this Order, DCFS shall not remove a child from a parent or continue the \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:4773\nremoval by another person authorized to take protective custody under state law \nunless the standard set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, ¶ 2055 is met, and unless \nDCFS has made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of \nthe child.  “Reasonable efforts” as used in this paragraph and paragraph 7 means \nsuch efforts to preserve the family as are consistent with good social work \npractice based on the individual circumstances of the case and the best interest of \nthe child, and may include but are not limited to the offer and provision of \nappropriate family preservation services from among those listed at Ill. Rev. Stat. \nch. 23, ¶ 2058.2.  In certain instances, it may be that, due to the individual \ncircumstances of the case and the best interests of the child, no efforts reasonably \ncan be made to preserve the family.  Nothing in this paragraph will require DCFS \nto refrain from taking protective custody if there is reason to believe the child is in \nimminent danger to his or her life or health. \n*   *   * \nMONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION \n*   *   * \n  68.  Monitoring Compliance with this Decree.  Class counsel for \nplaintiffs shall receive from DCFS sufficient information to permit plaintiffs to \nevaluate the status of DCFS’s compliance with this Decree.  The obligations to \nprovide such information will be discharged in the following manner: \n \n    a.  Defendant shall provide information regarding compliance \nwith this Decree, the Implementation Plan and the Annual Plans to class counsel \nfor plaintiffs on a semi-annual basis . . .   [T]he parties will jointly develop a set of \ncategories of measurable information to assist in evaluating the quality of care \nprovided to children.  To the extent possible, the parties will endeavor to use these \ncategories to develop standards to evaluate compliance with this Decree.  . . . \n \n    b.  In addition to the Semi-Annual Report, but consistent with \nthe considerations in subparagraph a, class counsel for plaintiffs may at any time \nmake reasonable requests for, and DCFS shall provide, additional reports or \ninformation.  DCFS shall ensure that class counsel for plaintiffs, upon prior notice \nto defendant’s counsel, shall have reasonable access to records and information of \nDCFS of any person or agency contracting with DCFS to provide care and \nservices to children relating to the provisions of services to class members.   . . . \n \n    c.  If the parties are unable to agree on the provision of \ninformation or access to records, information, persons or agencies set forth in this \nparagraph, either party may file an appropriate motion with the Court for relief. \n \nRestated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at 5-6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 55, 59-62.   \n  In addition, the restated consent decree sets out required staffing levels.  For example, the \nparties agreed that child protective services investigators could be assigned no more than twelve \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:4774\nnew abuse or neglect investigations each month for nine months of the year and no more than \nfifteen during the other three months of the year.  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at 28).  \nThe parties also included a limit on the number of cases that could be handled by caseworkers \nworking with intact families, i.e., those families from which no child had been removed.  \nSpecifically, the parties agreed that each caseworker should be assigned a caseload not to exceed \n20 intact families per caseworker.  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at 28). \n  On November 6, 2017, plaintiffs requested that defendant provide information.  \nSpecifically, plaintiffs requested that defendants: \n(i)  State what practice model, if any, the Department was using for intact \n  family service  provision pre-privatization. \n(ii)  By agency, identify the practice model (if any) that each private agency \n  providing intact services presently uses for intact family services; \n(iii)  From January, 2016 forward, by agency, identify the total number of intact \n  cases that are or have been the subject of a further call and investigation \n  while intact services were being provided, the name of the child involved \n  for each, and the city where the family was residing at the relevant times; \n  if the family receiving intact services has been the subject of more than \n  one further call and investigation, each of those instances should be \n  counted. \n(iv)  For each intact case identified in response to part (ii) state whether the \n  Department conducted an investigation as to the sufficiency of the initial \n  investigation by the Department and/or the sufficiency of services \n  provided by the private agency and state the determinations reached for \n  that investigation; \n(v)  State how the Department is identifying which intact cases present “high \n  risk” and thus merit transfer back to the Department for handling; \n(vi)  By region, identify the DCFS workers who have sufficient experience to \n  handle “high risk” intact family cases and the capacity to accept such \n  cases while remaining within the BH caseload limits; \n(vii)   Provide the current caseload for any internal DCFS worker who now is \n  handling intact family cases (we understand that there are at least 160 \n  intact cases presently assigned to DCFS workers); \n(viii)  Explain what the Department is doing to ensure that its assignment of \n  intact cases to agencies who are already at their contract capacity does not \n  result in excessive caseloads for the agency’s workers; and \n(ix)   Explain how private agencies are paid for case assignments that exceed \n  the agency’s contract capacity; \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:4775\n(x)  Explain what the Department is doing to address insufficient provider \n  resources for the current intact family caseload (we understand that \n  assignments to private providers at present exceeds the total contracted \n  capacity by at least 250 cases).  \n \n(Docket 600-1 at 21-22).   \n  After several extensions, defendant responded on January 26, 2018.  With respect to \ncaseloads for intact-family caseworkers, defendant stated in its response: \nBeginning in August 2017, DCFS developed a new report to monitor intact family \nservices, including caseloads for individual caseworkers servicing intact family \nservice cases.  DCFS can provide reports on caseloads for individual caseworkers \nservicing intact family services, which include DCFS caseworkers and POS \ncaseworkers from August 2017 going forward.  These reports are run on a daily \nbasis and DCFS recommends that this information be provided to you on a \nmonthly basis and that DCFS provide the reports for the same date every month in \norder for you to determine compliance with Paragraph 27 of the Restated Consent \nDecree.  I have attached the caseload data for January 25, 2018 and can provide \nthis data for the 25th day of the month for August 2017 through December 2017. \n \n(Docket 600-1 at 50).  With respect to the other information plaintiffs requested, defendant stated \nthat it was not going to supply the information on the grounds that the restated consent decree \ndoes not require it to provide such information. \n  Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel defendant to provide the information.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat the information should be provided pursuant to ¶¶ 4(a), 5(a), 5(b), 8 and 27(a) of the restated \nconsent decree.  Because plaintiffs rely on the terms of the restated consent decree as the basis of \ntheir motion, they are, in effect, asking the Court to enforce the restated consent decree. \nII.  STANDARD ON A MOTION TO ENFORCE A CONSENT DECREE \n  A court has the inherent authority to enforce its own orders.  A consent decree is “a court \norder that embodies the terms agreed upon by the parties as a compromise to litigation.”  United \nStates v. Alshabkhoun, 277 F.3d 930, 934 (7th Cir. 2002).  A court interprets a consent decree as \nit would any other contract.  Bailey v. Roob, 567 F.3d 930, 940 (7th Cir. 2009); Alshabkhoun, \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:4776\n277 F.3d at 934.  “Unless there is a substantial claim under federal law, the district judge should \nnot enter or continue to enforce a consent decree affecting the operation of a governmental \nbody.”  Evans v. City of Chi., 10 F.3d 474, 483 (7th Cir. 1993). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n  Plaintiffs seek to enforce the consent decree by compelling defendant to produce a \nsignificant amount of information about intact families, i.e., families from which no child has \nbeen removed.   \n  The restated consent decree allows plaintiffs to obtain information from defendant so that \nplaintiffs can evaluate whether defendant is complying with the decree.  Specifically, paragraph \n68 of the restated consent decree states, “Class counsel for plaintiffs shall receive from DCFS \nsufficient information to permit plaintiffs to evaluate the status of DCFS’s compliance with this \nDecree.”  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 68).  The decree also allows counsel for \nplaintiffs to “make reasonable requests” for additional reports or information.  (Restated Consent \nDecree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 68(b)).   \n  In support of their motion, plaintiffs argue that they should be provided information about \nintact families, because the “Plaintiff Class includes children who should have been removed \nfrom their families upon a first report to the hotline, were left at home with a plan for intact \nservices, and then suffered further injury (or even death) as a result.”  (Plaintiff’s motion [600] at \n7).  The Court disagrees.  The restated consent decree explicitly defines the class as “persons \nwho, on or after the date of commencement of this action, are in the custody of the Illinois \nDepartment of Children and Family Services and who have been placed somewhere other than \nwith their parents.”  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 1(e) (emphasis added)).  Thus, \nchildren in intact families are not members of the class and are not covered by the restated \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:4777\nconsent decree.  The class definition does not provide a hook for plaintiffs to obtain information \nabout services to intact families. \n  Plaintiffs also state that particular provisions of the restated consent decree entitle them to \ninformation about intact families.  Specifically, plaintiffs assert that paragraphs 4(a), 5(a), 5(b), 8 \nand 27(a) entitle them to the information they have requested.  The Court disagrees.  Paragraphs \n4(a) and 5(a) apply only to class members.  Paragraph 4(a) states, “Children shall be free from \nforeseeable and preventable physical harm,” while paragraph 5(a) says that “children will be \ntimely and stably placed in safe and appropriate living arrangements.”  (Restated Consent \nDecree/Docket 456-2 at ¶¶ 4(a) & 5(a)).  Given that the decree defines children as the members \nof the class, which does not include the offspring of intact families (Restated Consent \nDecree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 1(e)), paragraphs 4(a) and 5(a) do not apply to intact families.  Thus, \nplaintiffs do not need information about intact families in order to evaluate whether defendant is \ncomplying with ¶¶ 4(a) and 5(a). \n  Nor do the provisions of ¶¶ 5(b) and 8 grant plaintiffs carte blanche to demand \ninformation about intact families.  Those provisions obligate defendant to make “reasonable \nefforts” not to remove children from a home.  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 5(b) \n(“reasonable efforts, as determined based on individual circumstances (including consideration \nof whether no efforts would be reasonable) shall be made to prevent removal of children from \ntheir homes and stably to reunite children with their parents”) & ¶ 8 (“DCFS shall not remove a \nchild from a parent or continue the removal by another person authorized to take protective \ncustody under state law unless the standard set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, ¶ 2055 is met, and \nunless DCFS has made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the \nchild.”)).  Given that the decree allows plaintiffs access to information in order to evaluate \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:4778\ncompliance, the Court agrees that plaintiffs could inquire, with respect to particular class \nmembers (i.e., individuals who have been removed from parents), whether reasonable efforts \nwere made to prevent removal of the particular class member before that particular class member \nwas removed.  The Court does not, however, agree that those provisions give plaintiffs carte \nblanche to request any information they might be interested in with respect to intact families.  \nPlaintiffs have not limited their request to information about their own class members and \nwhether defendant made reasonable efforts not to remove those class members from their homes.  \nTo allow plaintiffs to obtain all of the information they request about intact families (including \nthe names and locations of children who are not class members but who were involved in intact \nfamily services) would expand the scope of the decree.    \n  This does not, however, mean plaintiffs are entitled to no information about intact \nfamilies.  Paragraph 27(a) sets out a maximum caseload of 20 families per caseworker \nresponsible for intact families.  (Restated Consent Decree/Docket 456-2 at ¶ 27(a)).  Plaintiffs \ncan seek information to evaluate compliance with this provision.  Plaintiffs requested \ninformation on caseloads, and defendant provided a snapshot of caseloads as of the day before it \nresponded.  Defendant also offered to send a report with such caseloads on a monthly basis.  \nPlaintiffs describe the response as “unusable,” but they do not explain why the information does \nnot suffice.  It sounds sufficient to the Court. \n  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the consent decree by compelling the \nproduction of information is denied.  Because the Court is denying the motion to enforce on the \nmerits, it need not consider whether a substantial federal issue still exists in this case.  See Evans, \n10 F.3d at 480 (“All of these cases illustrate the principle we recognize today:  entry and \ncontinued enforcement of a consent decree regulating the operation of a governmental body \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 631 Filed: 06/18/18 Page 9 of 9 PageID #:4779\ndepends on the existence of a substantial claim under federal law.  Unless there is such a claim, \nthe consent decree is no more than a contract, whose enforcement cannot be supported by the \ndiversity jurisdiction and that has in court no more force than it would have outside of court.  \nProspective enforcement therefore is ‘inequitable’ within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5).”) \n(internal citations omitted). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs’ motion [600] is denied. \n \nSO ORDERED.    ENTERED:   June 18, 2018  \n \n \n           \n  __________________________________\n  JORGE L.

The  reporting  period  for  the  Third \nTriannual Interim Status Report addresses the time period generally from April 2017 through \nAugust 2017. During this reporting period, DCFS experienced a change in leadership.  Beverly J. \nWalker  was  appointed  Acting  Director  of  DCFS  on  June  23,  2017  [Dkt.  551,  Notice  of \nSubstitution of Defendant Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d)].  Acting Director \nWalker has wide-ranging experience in child and public welfare administration and system \nreform.  Id.   \nDCFS continues to make progress toward reform.  This is evident from the data in the \nimmersion sites, which demonstrated increases in adoptions, guardianships and reunifications \nfor youth in care.  These increases in permanency in the immersion sites exceeded the rate of \nincrease for adoptions, guardianships and reunifications in the balance of the state.  The data \nfrom the immersion sites demonstrates that adoptions increased by 49% in the immersion sites \nand 37% in the balance of the state, guardianships increased by 185% in the immersion sites and \n49% in the balance of the state and reunifications increased by 14% in the immersion sites, \nwhile  declining  by  14%  in  the  balance  of  the  state.    Acting  Director  Walker  has  begun \ndiscussions with the Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel about reformation of the immersion site roll \nout process in accordance with the provision of the Restated B.H. Consent Decree, ¶68.  See \ndiscussion infra, pp. 30-39.  \nFurther progress is demonstrated by other projects, such as the Regenerations pilot, \nwhich continue to show promise.  The Regenerations pilot, which targets dually involved youth \nwho are ready for release from the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Cook County, \n1 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 4 of 66 PageID #:2510\n \ncontinues to demonstrate improvements in placing these youth in family and family-like settings \nand in the stability of these family and family-like placements. See discussion infra, pp. 22-28. \nAnother area of growth is with respect to the administrative, rulemaking and training \nrelated to subsidized guardianships, fictive kin and family findings.  The rulemaking process to \nupdate the DCFS rules with the revised definition of fictive kin is in the final stages and all staff \nin the immersion sites have been trained on the new Procedure 315.  The data with respect to \npermanency for older youth also shows promising trends.  There was an increase in youth ages \n12 to 17 that exited care through both adoption and guardianship in Fiscal Year 2017 compared \nto Fiscal Year 2016.  See infra, pp. 39-42.  \nAs with any reform effort, some projects continue to progress at a slower pace.  These \nprojects, however, also evidence promising trends.  The Therapeutic Foster Care pilot was slow \nto get off the ground and recruitment and certification of homes has proven a challenge, but \ncontinues to show improvement.  Notably, the “hybrid” model employed by Children’s Home \nand Aid is identifying fictive kin and relative placements quicker than originally anticipated.  \nThe Therapeutic Residential Pilot Management Initiative, which was able to get teams in place \nin  the  pilot  sites  in  advance  of  projected  dates,  has  also  experienced  staffing  challenges, \nhowever, those staffing issues appear to have been recently resolved.  Preliminary data trends \nshow a decrease in substantiated child abuse and neglect investigations in programs in the \nTRPMI pilot sites.  See infra, pp. 52-59.  \n \nDetailed Status Report \nThe following provides the detailed report regarding the various initiatives that DCFS has \nundertaken pursuant to the Implementation Plan. \n \n2 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 5 of 66 PageID #:2511\n \nI.  Application of Implementation Science to the Implementation Plan: \n \nUtilize principles of implementation science to develop, implement, evaluate and modify \ninitiatives outlined in the B.H. Implementation Plan. \n1.        Project Goals/Target: This Court’s Order of July 11, 2016 [Dkt. 527] provides \nfor DCFS’s retention of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN), to review and \ncomment on DCFS’s adherence to best practices in implementation science and assist with an \nassessment of DCFS’s implementation capacity and strategy. \n2.  Status  Report:  During this reporting period, the parties have been discussing \nvarious ways to utilize the expertise of NIRN in the continued implementation of the various \npilots.  The parties were unable to schedule a meeting due to conflicting schedules and priorities.  \nMary Nam, the new DCFS Associate Director, Strategy and Performance Execution, previously \nworked with Dr. Metz during her tenure at the Administration for Children and Families in New \nYork City.  Ms. Nam is working to engage Dr. Metz in future meetings. \n3.  Revised Targets/Goals:  An in-person meeting with Dr. Metz will be scheduled \nat which there will be further discussion of implementation science and teaming issues with \nrespect to the B.H. Implementation Plan.  In addition, Associate Director Mary Nam recently \nmet in person with Dr. Metz. \nII.       Overarching Outcome Measures \n1.  Project Goals/Target:  The  Implementation Plan  requires  DCFS  to  measure \nsafety, permanency and well-being of class members and to monitor changes in both the \nquality and quantity of services and supports to class members and their families.    The \nmetrics DCFS will use for measuring safety and permanency are the same measures used in the \nnational Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSR), and the measures for well-being are based \n3 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 6 of 66 PageID #:2512\n \non a matrix developed by the Child Welfare Advisory Sub-Committee.  Implementation Plan, \npp. 4-7. \n2.  Status Report: \n  Validation of Safety, Permanency and Stability Measures.   The  validation of the \nsafety, permanency, and stability measures is nearly complete.  After initial validation efforts \nwere completed, errors were identified and submitted to Mindshare for corrections. In September \n2017, Mindshare completed the corrections and DCFS began the second round of validation.   \nFinal validation of the safety, permanency and stability metrics are anticipated to be completed \nby November 2017.  \n  Data  with  respect  to  children  and  youth  achieving  permanency  through  adoption, \nguardianship  and  reunification  continue  to  trend  upward.    There  were  increases  in  overall \npermanency for children in youth during the first seven months of the calendar year in 2017 \nwhen compared to the first seven months of the calendar year in 2016.  The largest increases \nwere in adoptions and in guardianships.  During the first seven months of calendar year 2017, \nthere were 1069 adoptions completed compared to 803 during the first seven months of calendar \nyear 2016. Likewise, during the first seven months of calendar year 2017, there were 272 \nguardianships completed compared to 189 during the first seven months of 2016.  Notably, the \nnumber of youth exiting foster care without a permanency decreased from 878 in 2016 to 448 in \n2017.

The CANS 2.0 was integrated into SACWIS on August \n2017.  \n5 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 8 of 66 PageID #:2514\n \nIM CANS.  DCFS decided to proceed with implementation of the IM CANS and that is \nscheduled to occur in March 2018. \nPrioritization for Mindshare.  The contract for the Mindshare platform is in place \nuntil January 2018 and DCFS is looking to extend that contract.  DCFS has acquired software \nto develop dashboards in-house and a plan to train staff on the new software is currently being \ndeveloped.   \nValidation of CANS Data.  The database developed by DCFS and Objective Arts is \nfunctional.  There  was  an  initial  challenge  regarding  the  identification  of  cases  due  to  the \nrequirement to tap into the Integrated Assessment database, but that issue was resolved.  The \ncurrent plan is to upload cases once a week to the databases.  \nISBE   Data   Integration   into   SACWIS:   Individual child data from the Illinois \nState Board of Education (ISBE) has been integrated into SACWIS as of the beginning of \nOctober 2017. The integration allows DCFS and POS caseworkers and supervisors to link to an \nindividual youth’s education record for kindergarten through high school for any school that \nreports to ISBE.  Exhibit B, ISBE Student Profile.  The next step in the ISBE record integration \nwill involve DCFS building a data warehouse that will contain the education records for youth \nin care, including those youth who have achieved permanency.  The data warehouse will allow \nDCFS to obtain aggregate data on youth in care, such as the number of youth in care who \ngraduated high school in 2016.  The data warehouse is anticipated to be completed by the end \nof 2017.  Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects. \nExpansion  of  Access  to  the  Mindshare  Website  Within  DCFS.  Training  for \nadditional DCFS staff on the Mindshare platform continues and project managers are trained as \nthe dashboards for their projects are developed. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 9 of 66 PageID #:2515\n \nPrivate  Provider  Access  to  Mindshare.    DCFS  continues  to  explore  options  for \ndeveloping and implementing the necessary protocol to allow private provider access to DCFS \ndashboards.  There are significant technical and security issues that will need to be resolved in \norder to provide access to outside providers.   \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \nValidation of Safety, Permanency and Stability Measures.   The final validation of \nthe safety, permanency and stability measures is anticipated to be completed by November \n2017.  \nIntegration of CANS Data. Since DCFS completed the consolidation of the CANS \napplication into SACWIS in August 2017, no new target or goal is required.   \nThe Juvenile Protective Association and Northwestern will complete a data analysis of \nthe metrics specifically related to the wellbeing measure in the Implementation Plan by June \n15, 2017 and the initial findings will be issued by the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year \n2018. \nIM CANS.  The IM CANS will be implemented by March 2018. \nPrioritization for Mindshare.  DCFS continues its contract with Mindshare, which \nbegan in September 2015 and is scheduled to end in January 2018.  DCFS is currently looking \nto extend the Mindshare contract regarding the dashboards.  At the same time, DCFS will train \nstaff on a software program that will allow DCFS to develop and maintain the dashboards \ninternally.  \nISBE Data Integration into SACWIS.  The integration of individual child and youth \ndata from ISBE was completed in October 2017.  The next phase of the data integration will \ninvolve the creation by DCFS of a data warehouse of educational records that will allow for \n7 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 10 of 66 PageID #:2516\n \naggregate  data  to  be  produced and  analyzed.    This  data  warehouse  is  anticipated  to  be \ncompleted by December 2017.  \nExpansion of Access to Mindshare Website Within DCFS.  This has been completed. \nPrivate Provider Access to Mindshare.   DCFS continues to evaluate whether security \nconcerns can be addressed to allow private provider access to the DCFS dashboards.  DCFS is \nexploring  other  options  to  provide  this  data  to  private  agencies,  such  as  through  other \ndashboards that are already in place, such as the Agency Performance Team dashboards, and \nthrough Tableau, a user friendly visualization tool.  The State of Illinois has an existing contract \nwith Tableau.  \nIII.  Implementation of Specific Recommendations of the Expert Panel \nA.  Panel Recommendation #1: \nInstitute a children’s system of care demonstration program that permits POS agencies \nand DCFS sub-regions to waive selected policy and funding restrictions on a trial basis in order \nto reduce the use of residential treatment and help children and youth succeed in living in the \nleast restrictive, most family-like setting.  Implementation Plan, pp. 7-25.  \nThe Implementation Plan identifies four initiatives DCFS is pursuing in response to \nRecommendation # 1.  The first is the Therapeutic Foster Care pilot (TFC) initiative.  The second \nis the Case Management Entity pilot (CME).  The remaining two are programs targeted to the \nneeds of “dually involved youth” – the Regenerations pilot and Pay for Success.  Each of these \nprograms is discussed individually below. \nB.  Panel Recommendation #1: Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots \n \n1.  Project  Goals / Target:  The  Implementation  Plan  calls  for  DCFS  to  select \nprivate  agencies  to  implement  evidence-based  or  evidence-informed  therapeutic foster  care \nprograms over the next five years.  The goal of the TFC pilot is to determine whether outcomes \n8 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 11 of 66 PageID #:2517\n \nfor youth served in the TFC pilot programs are equal to or better than those for youth who meet \nthe  clinical  criteria  for  residential  treatment  and  are  placed  in  residential  treatment. \nImplementation Plan, pp. 8-13.  At least 60% of the youth served in TFC licensed homes are \nto be age 12 and older.  Implementation Plan, pp. 8-9. \nDCFS set a two-year goal for the recruitment and licensure of therapeutic foster parents \nand placements.  The original goal included placement of a minimum of 40 children and youth \nin licensed TFC  homes  at  the  end  of  the  “first  contractual  year”  (i.e.  April 2018) and \nplacement of a minimum of 100 children and youth at the end of the “second contractual year” \n(i.e. April 2019). \n2.  Status Report: \n \nDevelopment and Service Contracts. The development contracts were in place during \nthe prior fiscal year and were not renewed.   \nThe  service  contracts  executed  for  Fiscal  Year  2018  contain  performance  based \npayments to the private agencies for each new licensed and certified TFC home.  Exhibit D, \nFour Month Status Report Therapeutic Foster Care; Exhibit E, Fiscal Year 2018 Contracts.  \nThe agencies also executed addendums to the service contracts which provides that the agency \nwill be reimbursed on a pay-for-performance basis in the amount of $6,600 for each new TFC \ntrained home made available to provide care in accordance with the program plan.  DCFS will \nmake a one-time up-front payment of $6,600 for each of the first two trained TFC homes \nwithin 60 days.  The addendum further provides that the up-front payment will be returned to \nDCFS if new homes are not available by June 30, 2018.   \nThe original plan was that CHASI would not be part of the pilot because CHASI was \nusing a “hybrid” version of the TFC model to include home of relatives and fictive kin that \nwould be monitored by DCFS but not officially included within the overall TFC evaluation.  \n9 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 12 of 66 PageID #:2518\n \nHowever, this original plan was modified after a determination by DCFS, Chapin Hall and \nCHASI that CHASI had a viable model and therefore it should be included in the evaluation \nof the TFC model.  A separate logic model was created for CHASI and the tracking sheet was \nalso modified in some respects.  Exhibit F, CHASI Logic Model and TFC Logic Model: \nDeflection and Step-Down.  \nTFC Placements.   DCFS, along with Chapin Hall, created one uniform tracking sheet \nthat each agency submits on a bi-weekly basis which contains information on recruitment, \ntraining, licensing and certification of foster parents, referrals of youth to agencies and the \nacceptance, denial and placement of youth in TFC homes.  Exhibit G, Tracking Sheet Summary.  \nAs of August 31, 2017, 19 youth have been placed in TFC homes; 11 of the youth \nplaced, or 57.9% of the youth placed in TFC homes are 12 years of age or older at the time of \nplacement and 8 of the youth, or 42.1%, are less than 12 years of age or younger at the time of \nplacement.  LSSI had one youth who was hospitalized on June 30, 2017 and was transitioned to \na higher level of care upon discharge. That minor was placed in a residential treatment facility \non September 20, 2017.  \nTen of the youth are placed in LSSI TFC homes, three of the youth are placed in YOS \nTFC homes and one youth is placed in a JCFS TFC home.  Five of the youth are placed in \nCHASI  homes with relatives. \nTFC Foster Parent Recruitment.  LSSI has 16 certified TFC homes, YOS has four \ncertified TFC homes and JCFS has three certified homes.  LSSI has seven homes that are \ncurrently available for placement and have five foster families in the pipeline for either \nlicensure or certification.  Families who are in the “pipeline” are families who have \nexpressed more than a mere interest in being licensed and certified as a TFC certified \nhomes. These families have completed licensing applications, are awaiting background \n10 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 13 of 66 PageID #:2519\n \nclearances and are either in training or near completion of the required trainings.  YOS \nhas  one  TFC  home  that  is  being  used  for  respite  purposes  only.    YOS  has  case \nmanagement responsibility for two other TFC homes, but the youth in those homes are \nboth currently in detention.  The plans for those youth, pursuant to court orders, are for \nthose youth not to return to their prior foster placements.  YOS had another TFC home \nthat requested to be taken off intake due to personal family issues.  YOS has three foster \nfamilies in the pipeline:  one is waiting background check clearances, one is currently in \nFoster Parent PRIDE Training and another is preparing to take the Foster Parent PRIDE \nTraining.  \nJCFS has one youth in a TFC placement and two TFC foster homes available for \nplacement.  JCFS has one foster parent who transferred her foster home license to JCFS \nand  is  enrolled  in  specific  TFC  training,  and  also  has  another  foster  parent  who  is \nlicensed and interested in the TFC certification but has not yet begun training.  \nCHASI’s recruitment activities are different than the other agencies because they are \nlooking to place youth with relatives and fictive kin.  CHASI has five youth currently placed in \ntheir version of TFC homes.  CHASI has accepted an additional four youth for placement and \nthese are youth that are either in CHASI residential facilities or for whom CHASI has case \nmanagement authority and are youth that CHASI has committed to placing in their TFC \nprogram.   CHASI has also identified four youth that will be placed in November 2017.   \n  TFC Referrals and Eligibility.   The timeline between referral to a TFC agency and \nplacement continues to be an issue, which DCFS has taken a number of steps to address.  The \nreferrals for the youth who may be eligible for a TFC placement are monitored by the DCFS \nCentral Matching Unit and DCFS Pilot Manager for TFC.  For a short period of time, TFC did \nnot  receive  referrals  as  the  agencies  were  identifying  homes  for  placement.  Also  Central \n11 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 14 of 66 PageID #:2520\n \nMatching would continue to review youth who still were in need of placement to see if they met \nthe criteria for TFC. After discussions about this issue, TFC began to receive referrals for \npresentation to the agencies.  \n  Another factor is the time lapse between the agency receiving the referral, the time for \naccepting/ denying the referral, and if accepted the time for placement. DCFS is working with the \nBH experts in trying to implement strategies to address this concern.    \n  Each youth who is considered for TFC has a score of 5 on the CASII.  DCFS Clinical \nstaff have agreed to provide assistance on youth who may not have a CASII and will work with \nthe current placement of the youth to schedule and complete the CASII assessment.  \n  DCFS  also  works  with  the  Therapeutic  Residential  Program  Monitoring  Initiative \n(TRPMI).  This  collaboration  allows  the  TFC  providers  to  embed  themselves  in  standard \nresidential  discharge  procedures  for  eligible  TFC  youth  so  that  the  additional  screening, \nassessments, and requirements specific to each TFC provider can co-occur with the residential \ndischarge process.  If a youth meets the TFC criteria and eligibility, the agency who is reviewing \nthe referral will participate in staffings/ meetings pertaining to the youths step down needs. This \nallows for the  receiving agency to have all current and up to date information on the youth to be \nconsidered for matching to a TFC foster home. At the end of this reporting period, no youth \nidentified by TRPMI has been placed in a TFC home.  \n    To address the concern that no youth identified by TRPMI have been placed in TFC \nhomes, the logic model has been revised and the DCFS Clinical Unit has agreed to complete the \nCASII assessment to attempt to facilitate this process.  TFC providers have also increased their \nefforts to work closely with case managers and Centralized Matching staff to identify youth who \nmay be matched with a residential treatment facility but who can also be considered for a TFC \nplacement. This is being done by having the TFC case managers for the agencies ensure that they \n12 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 15 of 66 PageID #:2521\n \nhave complete packets regarding the youth during the placement consideration phase.  Also the \nTFC agencies will participate in any meetings or staffings for a youth who is being considered \nfor a TFC placement.  This will include attending court dates as well to attempt to obtain all of \nthe relevant information regarding the youth so that that information can be considered during \nthe placement process.  \nTFC Evaluation.  During this reporting period, a number of changes were made to the \nevaluation design for the TFC pilot, after consultation and approval of the Expert Panel.  The \nmost significant change include a decision to conduct three separate evaluations to clearly \ndistinguish the three TFC target populations -- step-down from  residential, deflection from \nresidential and CHASI model.   The step-down from residential population includes youth who \nare currently placed in a residential treatment facility and who score a 5 on a CASII conducted \nwithin 90 days of the TFC referral; the deflection population include youth who are not currently \nin residential care, but who score a 5 on a CASII conducted within 90 days of the TFC referral; \nand the CHASI population includes youth ages 12-17 in Cook County who are currently in \nresidential care and are ready to step down from residential care to the community, though \nCASII is  not used for CHASI referrals.  \nThe second change involves a decision to focus strictly on DCFS administrative data to \nexamine outcomes differences instead of using survey data when it became apparent that the \nTFC Pilot is, in fact, three separate evaluations.   After consultation with BH expert Dr. Mark \nTesta, a decision was made that DCFS administrative data can be used to operationalize safety, \npermanency, and well-being outcomes for both the TFC intervention groups and the control \ngroups, and that DCFS administrative data would be a robust data source for the TFC Pilot \nevaluation. This provides a more accurate reflection of  the number of youth placed in TFC.  For \nthe step-down and deflection evaluations, the DCFS administrative data will be used to compare \n13 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 16 of 66 PageID #:2522\n \noutcomes between the TFC intervention groups and the residential care comparison groups.  For \nthe CHASI evaluation, administrative data will be used for a comparison of home of relative or \nhome of fictive kin, or adolescent foster care. The outcomes in the logic model have been revised \nto measure progress over an extended period while focusing on particular areas of youth safety, \npermanency, and well-being. Proximal outcomes (safety) will seek to decrease the percentage of \nyouth with one or more substantiated investigations. Intermediate outcomes (permanency) will \nseek to increase the percentage of discharges to family and fictive kin caregivers, increase \npercentage of discharges to permanency from TFC/residential care, and track the length of stay \nin TFC/residential care. Distal outcomes (well-being) will seek to decrease the percentage of \ndays  in  detention,  psychiatric  care,  and  runaway  during  TFC/residential  care  and  within  6 \nmonths of TFC/residential care discharge and decrease the number of placement moves per day \nin care within 6 months of TFC/residential care discharge. Additionally, the distal outcomes will \nseek to improve traumatic stress symptoms, emotional/behavioral needs, risk behaviors, and \nsocial functioning per CANS. \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nExpansion and Service Contracts. Service contracts are in place for Fiscal Year 2018 \nand those contracts were issued in the regular course of the fiscal year contracting process.  \nThere was no delay in the processing or execution of the service contracts for FY18. There have \nbeen no concerns expressed for this reporting period regarding contractual issues. \nTFC  Placements.    The  revised  placement  goals  and  timeline  for  the  TFC  pilot \nremains as stated in the Implementation Plan and prior reports to the Court -- a minimum of 40 \nchildren and youth in licensed TFC homes by April 1, 2018 and to have placement of  a \nminimum of 100 children and youth by April 1, 2019, with at least 60% of the youth served in \nthe age group of 12 and older.  DCFS is on target for the April 2018 goal, even if the \n14 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 17 of 66 PageID #:2523\n \nproviders have not satisfied their anticipated numbers of licensed and certified homes and \nplacements set for September 30, 2017. There have been no new goals identified for the \nproviders during this reporting period.  \nTFC Foster Parent Recruitment.  DCFS has received foster parent recruitment plans \nfrom LSSI and JCFS and continues to monitor closely the progress of the three agencies \nto recruit and certify TFC foster homes to meet these revised deadlines.  CHASI does not have \na  foster  parent  recruitment  plan  given  the  “hybrid”  model  they  are  implementing.    The \nplacements for CHASI are home of relative and/or fictive kin placements and are identified \nthrough other efforts, such as family findings, and not through recruitment.  CHASI does \nprovide DCFS information on a monthly basis on family members that are trained in the hybrid \nmodel for each youth who is accepted into a CHASI home trained in the hybrid TFC model. \nCHASI accepts youth who are ready to step down from residential care; meaning they no longer \nneed the intensive services of residential placements.  \n  It is anticipated that the performance based payment for the licensure and certification of \nfoster homes will assist in recruitment efforts.  \nTFC Referrals  and  Eligibility.  DCFS continues to monitor the referral and eligibility \nprocess to ensure timeliness in the decision and placement process and this information is \nreported monthly to the DCFS Project Manager.    It has taken the TFC agencies longer than the \nfive to seven days to decide whether they will accept a youth for placement into a TFC home \nand additional time is often required to actually get the youth placed in the home. The identified \nbarriers for this process include the time for gathering information regarding the youth, time to \nactually interview the youth and time to engage the residential facilities in the TFC process.  To \naddress this issue, the DCFS project manager and Central Matching Unit staff have weekly \n15 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 18 of 66 PageID #:2524\n \nphone calls with the TFC agencies regarding the referral process.  The discussions include any \nclinical and referrals issues that might arise such as coordination of therapy and school issues.  \nThe TFC project manager is also attending a variety of internal DCFS meetings to \ndiscuss the TFC project and address questions that field staff have about the TFC pilot.  The \nTFC  project  manager  has  also  attended  meetings  with  the  developers  of  the  various  TFC \nmodels.  This process has assisted in explaining the various TFC models to staff, including \nfoster parent support specialists and caseworkers. \n  Discussions have also been held internally with CIPP and the Clinical Division in order \nto ensure that appropriate youth who meet the eligibility requirements for TFC get referred for \nResidential/ TFC concurrently. This allows the youth to be reviewed for residential placement if \nno TFC home is available and vice versa; it is hoped that this will decrease the length of time a \nyouth is waiting for placement. The DCFS Clinical Division has also agreed to complete CASII \nscores on youth to determine their level of care need.  \nC.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Care Management Entity \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe planned goals for the Care Management Entity (CME) pilot include:  increasing non-\ntraditional,  community-based  behavioral  health  supports;  faster  step-downs  for  youth  in \ncongregate care settings; treating youth and family voice and choice as primary factors in \npermanency planning and mental health/behavioral health interventions; placement of youth in \nspecialized foster care or congregate care settings rather than residential treatment facilities; \nincreased placement stability at the foster care level; high service-intensity youth receiving \nnecessary  behavioral  health  supports  and  services  in  their  home  and  community  settings; \ndecreased psychiatric hospitalization; and increased permanency.   \n16 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 19 of 66 PageID #:2525\n \nThe CME pilot, which is administered through Choices, began in February 2014 and is \nnow scheduled to continue through June 30, 2018.  The goal of the pilot was to serve 200 youth \nannually and 600 youth during the course of the pilot.  See Implementation Plan, p. 19. The \ntarget established in the last reporting period was for DCFS to revise the program plan with \nChoices to address issues regarding aftercare services, disenrollment (discharge) expectations \nand outcome data.  Additional planned changes included a requirement for aftercare services and \nmaintaining youth in the CME until permanency is achieved and DCFS is no longer the legal \nguardian of the youth.  Second Triannual Report at p. 14-15 and Exhibit H, Four Month Status \nReport, Care Management Entity Pilot Update.  In addition, it was anticipated that a monthly \ncensus of approximately 160 youth will be served through the CME pilot during FY 2018. \n  2.  Status Report:   \nExtension of the Pilot in FY18:  It is anticipated that a Medicaid managed care program \nwill be implemented for the children in DCFS’ care beginning as of Fiscal Year 2019; the \nChoices program will be superseded by that managed care program.  DCFS accordingly has \ndetermined that the CME model should remain in pilot status during Fiscal Year 2018.  DCFS \nand pilot staff continue to plan for ongoing service provision to youth upon the conclusion of the \npilot period.  Managed care will provide for the needs of the child to the extent there is Medicaid \ncoverage.  DCFS will be prepared to provide those services which are not covered by Medicaid.  \nExhibit H. \nChildren Served.  The CME pilot has served approximately 370 youth in care through \nAugust 31, 2017.  As of July 31, 2017, 164 youth in care were being served in the CME pilot.  \nExhibit H. \nMobile Crisis Response Services.  Mobile Crisis Response Services have had a positive \nresult.  Between April and July 2017, the available data shows that there was a generally lower \n17 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 20 of 66 PageID #:2526\n \nhospitalization rate for youth in care who were enrolled in the CME compared to those not \nenrolled in the CME pilot area.

A series of meetings was held in the summer of 2015 to discuss service deficits. \nDCFS, DMH, HFS, and the Youth and Family Peer Support Alliance met with community based \nproviders and parents in the community to discuss what service areas needed to be addressed. \nKey feedback from this meeting included the need for crisis respite, crisis support, intensive in \nhome services, and youth peer supports. As a result of these meetings, services were developed \nand rolled out. These have been added to the Choices provider network.  Some of these services, \nincluding intensive in home clinical support, were introduced more slowly in order to train \ncommunity providers to implement services.    \n  Addressing Program Barriers.  Monthly meetings with DCFS, private agency partners, \nand the CME, have continued to be an effective means of addressing concerns.  Meetings were \nconvened on May 30, 2017, June 27, 2017, and August 3, 2017. Discussion at the meetings \nincluded:  role clarity between care coordinators and caseworkers; availability of services; and  \nspecific examples of systemic challenges that were being experienced by caseworkers and care \ncoordinators.  For example, it was made clear that many of the child welfare stakeholders were \nnot aware of the number or types of services that the CME has access to.  The CME had an \nexisting online list of services that took several steps by the user to get to the information \ndesired.  In response to the discussion about the awkward path to obtain information, the CME \ncreated easier access to an online provider list that is clearer to navigate.  \n  Two to three cases were identified by each child welfare agency for review at the \nmeetings.    These  were  cases  in  which  intensive  service  needs  were  present  or  there  were \nescalating situations, such as heightened mental health needs, that could affect placement or \n19 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 22 of 66 PageID #:2528\n \npermanency.  The CME had not been considered a primary resource that caseworkers identified \nas a resource when their cases became challenging. The group focused on the individual cases to \naddress the specific barriers in those cases.  Exhibit H, pp. 3-4.   \n  Renewed Focus on Stepdown Placements.  The 52 youth who are enrolled in the CME \npilot, placed in a congregate care setting, and waiting for a step-down placement were selected \nfor qualitative review of the involvement of the Child and Family Teams  to examine and \nimprove the  transition of  youth to  a  less restrictive setting if clinically appropriate. These \nyouth are being reviewed by the Program Supervisor and the downstate Behavioral Health \nSpecialist, prioritized based on the length of the youth’s stay in a congregate care setting. The \nreviews involve participation by the Program Supervisor and Behavioral Health Specialist in \nupcoming CFTMs to identify additional resources and/or non-traditional supports and services \nrequired to either immediately step the youth down, or further prepare them for step down into \nless restrictive settings.  Because the expected outcome was a faster rate of step down, DCFS is  \nexamining what occurs in the CFTMs for youth in residential care  and also what Choices can \noffer as supports for potential placements for these youths.  For youth who overlap between \nCME enrollment and placement in a TRPMI identified residential facility, collaboration on these \nsteps continues.  A recent review of these youth showed they were either moving to a less \nrestrictive setting within a short time or had not been identified as appropriate for stepdown at \nthis juncture.  Exhibit H, p. 8.   \n2.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nExtension of the Pilot.  CME will remain in pilot status during FY 2018.   \nChildren Served. The goal for FY 2018 is for Choices to maintain a monthly census of \n160 children. \n20 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 23 of 66 PageID #:2529\n \nTransition  to  Medicaid  Managed  Care  Program.    As  the  transition  to  Medicaid \nmanaged care progresses, the Project Manager plans to convene internal meetings as well as \nmeetings with the Expert Panel, Plaintiffs’ counsel and other DCFS division representatives.  \nGeneral topics for discussion at those meetings will include decision-making for services to meet \nthe unique needs of child welfare involved families, communication between the MCO and the \nchild welfare staff and the manner in which conflicts will be resolved.  DCFS acknowledges that \nall work for children and families must be centered within the Child and Family Team and be \nfamily-driven.  The lessons learned from the Choices pilot include the fact that the child welfare \nstaff and MCO need to both know and acknowledge who will do what for a family and that the \ndecisions  need  to  be  driven  by  the  family.    Other  lessons  learned  include  the  need  for \nconsolidation of activities, guidelines for payment of services, and collaboration.  These areas \nwill also be included in the topics of ongoing discussions as the MCO process continues to roll \nout.  \n1.  Clarity of role and function of the Care Management Entity and child welfare.  \nManaged care is to bring the full array of Medicaid services to the child and \nfamily team. \n \n2.  The MCO must have a full array of physical and mental health services developed \nprior to work with DCFS clients.  These services must be available in all areas of \nthe state. \n \n3  Education of child welfare community partners regarding the MCO partnership, \nsuch as judges, State’s Attorneys, probation departments, Guardians ad Litem, \nCASA, school/education, and law enforcement, needs to occur before the launch \nof the MCO working with DCFS. \n \nCourt  Outreach.    DCFS  staff  will  schedule  meetings  with  court  personnel  from \nChampaign, Ford and Iroquois counties involved in the CME pilot during the next reporting \nperiod to continue to educate the various court systems on available programs and services.   \n21 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 24 of 66 PageID #:2530\n \n  Pilot Evaluation.  The target date for evaluation of the program through Fiscal Year \n2017 has been modified to November 2017 due to the time needed to educate the assigned \nresearcher regarding DCFS information systems. \n  D.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved  \n    Youth at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe Regenerations pilot is designed to provide placements and intensive services to \nDCFS youth in care, 12 to 18 years old, who are also involved in the juvenile justice system and \nare ready for release from the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).  Implementation \nPlan, pp. 20-22.  The program provides traditional mental health services, care coordination, \nfoster care services (if needed) and individualized home and community based services through a \nwraparound philosophy.  Id. The Regenerations pilot is a collaborative effort with the JTDC, \nCook County Juvenile Probation, Lutheran Child and Family Services (LCFS), Youth Advocate \nPrograms (YAP), and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  See Exhibit I, Regenerations \nPilot Project for Dually-Involved Youth at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center Four Month \nStatus Report, August 30, 2017; Exhibit J, DCFS Regenerations RUR/Pilot Logic Model August \n18, 2017.  The program goal was to serve 65 youth.  There was no deadline specified in the \nImplementation Plan for reaching that level of service, however the pilot was scheduled to be \ncompleted in June 2017.  Implementation Plan, p. 21.      \n2.  Status Report:    \nProgram Conversion.  The Regenerations pilot will continue through Fiscal Year 2018.  \nSince the pilot was fully implemented in Fiscal Year 2017 and it took longer than expected to get \ncomparison data, the decision was made to continue the pilot through Fiscal Year 2018 and to \nhave a final evaluation report by the end of Fiscal Year 2018.  Beginning in February 2017, \n22 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 25 of 66 PageID #:2531\n \nDCFS was to implement specific strategies to ensure that the service data and the billing data for \nyouth served through the pilot project are reconciled. The billing and service data has not yet \nbeen reconciled. DCFS is still in the process of addressing this matter by reviewing specific \ncases that have billing discrepancies. Billing discrepancies have not impacted service delivery \nand are being addressed by DCFS. The service data entry challenges are related to the lag time \nbetween when the service is provided and when the data is entered on the service provided into \nthe appropriate data base.  Data entry has improved and will be consistently evaluated for \nimprovement. Billing data has been reconciled for Fiscal Year 2017; service data is still being \nworked on for completing data entry.   \nAs of Fiscal Year 2018, YAP will serve as an independent contractor with DCFS. YAP \nwill continue to collaborate with LCFS and provide intensive advocacy support for current \nRegenerations youth.  YAP is planning to expand to serve other high risk youth outside of the \nRegenerations pilot by hiring additional staff for an increase in capacity for the next fiscal year. \nYAP and LCFS are working on a memorandum of understanding to be completed before the \ncommencement of Fiscal Year 2018 related to each entity’s responsibilities.  YOS is no longer \nbeing considered as an independent contractor.  More agencies were added because LCFS has \nlimited capacity for youth and there is a need for additional homes.  Exhibit I, p. 4.  LCFS and \nYAP have worked in tandem on the Regenerations project even before the pilot was created.  \nYAP  was  a  sub-contractor  of  LCFS.    In  Fiscal  Year  2018  YAP  became  an  independent \ncontractor and is no longer a subcontractor of LCFS.  There is a memorandum of understanding \nbetween YAP and LCFS that describes the responsibilities of each agency.   \nTwo case management/foster care providers have been added to expand support to youth \nidentified as RUR or with Target Release Dates.  These two new providers – NYAP and \nChildServ – will not be evaluated as part of the Regenerations Pilot.  DCFS contracts with \n23 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 26 of 66 PageID #:2532\n \nNYAP and ChildServ so that there are additional placements available for RUR youth when \nLCFS and YAP do not have capacity but there are court orders that require that youth be released \nfrom detention.  Youth are considered part of the Regenerations pilot if they are served by LCFS \nand  YAP  pursuant  to  the  original  Regenerations  pilot.    YOS  will  not  be  added  to  the \nRegenerations pilot; YOS is already working on Pay for Success.  \n  Foster Parent Recruitment.  LCFS has a foster home recruitment plan. LCFS submitted \na draft recruitment plan in June 2017 and the plan projects that 20 new homes will be added by \nthe  conclusion  of  Fiscal  Year  2018.  LCFS  began  additional  recruiting  in  June  2017.  A \nrecruitment event is planned for October 2017.  Although LCFS and YAP are the main parts of \nthe Regenerations pilot, there are limitations to placement resources that are needed from other \nagencies.  The  additional  agencies  are  expected  to  develop  between  nine  and  14  more \nspecialized/dually involved foster home beds within the next six months.  \nWraparound consultants.  LCFS and YAP are working together to schedule ongoing \nwraparound  training  for  direct  service  staff  involved  with  Regenerations  pilot.  YAP  has \nidentified the consultant. LCFS and YAP continue to work on the training that is required. LCFS \nand YAP have committed to setting a training schedule by December 31, 2107.      \n  Output Data Analysis.   According to output data analysis, there is substantial evidence \nthat  providers  are  ensuring  CFTMs  are  scheduled  with  consistent  frequency  and  there  is \ninclusion of all the child’s invested stakeholders at CFTMs, advocates are spending considerable \ntime with youth on a weekly basis, the majority of youth have an individualized service plan and \ncrisis intervention services in place if needed, and parents are engaged in their child’s education.  \nExhibit I, pp. 6-10.  The pilot went from reporting on three metrics in the previous four-month \nstatus report to 12 output metrics and six outcome metrics in this four-month status report. \nTwenty output measures in total are being assessed on a monthly basis. Chapin Hall provides \n24 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 27 of 66 PageID #:2533\n \nmonthly data metric reports, line graph and data charts of how many CFTMs occurred, and \nwhether the number met the threshold of .33 CFTMs per month per child.  The data provided in \nthe four month status report is a culmination of monthly reports. See Exhibit I. \n  The  status  of  whether  there  remains  an  increase  in  residential  placements  of  youth \npursuant to court orders and how that impact(ed) Regenerations ability to place youth is unclear. \nChapin Hall has found that there are fewer youth referred to residential treatment placements as \ncompared to the comparison group.  There is a significant waiting list for youth recommended or \nordered to residential treatment placements (60 to 90 days) due to limited bed capacity.   \n  Regenerations  data  was  to  be  incorporated  into  the  Mindshare  platform  within  this \nreporting period, and DCFS anticipated that it would begin tracking outcomes for the youth who \nhave  been  served  to  date,  with  a  particular  focus  on  stability  and  safety.    This  was  not \naccomplished during this reporting period.  However, comprehensive data is available through \nChapin Hall, which is the data keeper for the Regenerations pilot at this time.    \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nThe pilot project capacity goal was to serve an active caseload of 65 youth. Since \ninception of the pilot, July 1, 2015, and through August 15, 2017, 73 youth have participated in \nthe pilot. The comparison report looks at outcomes related to these 73 youth.  Exhibit I. DCFS \nwill request a final evaluation report from Chapin Hall to be completed by July 31, 2018.    \nDCFS  achieved  a  goal  of  involving  additional  case  management  agencies  (National \nYouth Advocate Program (NYAP) and ChildServ) and reduced  the number of days youth are \nbeyond RUR and increased home and community based settings from detention. NYAP and \nChildServe are not included in the pilot evaluation, but are assigned RUR cases. The purpose of \ninvolving these other agencies was to allocate additional service capacity for RUR cases than \nwhat LCFS/ YAP alone had capacity to serve.  \n25 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 28 of 66 PageID #:2534\n \n  Program Evaluation.   The goal of providing a comparative data analysis using a \nhistorical comparison group has been met.  During this reporting period, Chapin Hall was able to \ndevelop  an historical comparison group using fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for cases that were \n“RUR to DCFS” during their detention stays at the Cook County JTDC. Exhibit I includes \ncomparison group data.  References to the comprehensive analysis and historical comparison are \none and the same.  Below are some of the key findings of the pilot group versus this comparison \ngroup (Exhibit I, pp. 2, 5):  \n  The comparison group on average had a shorter wait (19.9 days) than the Pilot youth \n(39.0 days) from RUR to JTDC release, however, the Pilot group had a higher percentage \nof youth released from JTDC to family or family-like settings (64.3%) than the \ncomparison group (28.4%). \n \n  The Pilot group also had a lower percentage of youth released from JTDC to residential \ncare (21.4%) than the comparison group (35.5%). Among the youth released from JTDC \nto family or family-like settings, the Pilot group had a lower percentage of youth who had \na next placement in residential care (6.7%) than that of the comparison group (30.0%). \n \nIn terms of total placement moves after exit from detention, not controlling for follow-up time \nafter release from JTDC, the Pilot group had a lower average number of placement moves (3.6 \ntimes) than the comparison group (7.8 times).  This preliminary analysis does not control for \nfollow-up time. See Exhibit I. Placement moves were counted irrespective of the “placement \ntype” as defined in DCFS placement type codes.   \n  Data  Reports.  Chapin  Hall  administers  monthly  data  reports  at  the  monthly \nRegenerations Implementation Team meetings in order to provide real time feedback regarding \ncertain program outputs (e.g., average advocate service hours per week, parent/child/sibling \nvisitations per week, etc.) associated with the fidelity of the pilot’s service model.  The providers \ncontinue to struggle with submitting data to SharePoint and SACWIS in a timely manner by both \nYAP and LCFS staff.  Continued attention to this concern by DCFS and Chapin Hall staff in the \n26 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 29 of 66 PageID #:2535\n \nmonthly  implementation  meetings  through  a  review  of  outstanding  data  submissions  have \nmoderately  decreased  these  issues.    However,  there  is  an  understanding  that  continued \nmonitoring of this concern must be an ongoing priority by all parties.   \n   Dashboard.    The  date  for  completion  of  the  Regenerations  dashboard  is  not  yet \ndetermined, but this dashboard is in development phase with the assistance of outside consultants \nas  part  of  a  development  of  a  larger  information  collection  system.    Further  information \nconcerning a date for completion of the dashboard will be provided in the next reporting period.  \nHowever, as discussed above, Chapin Hall is providing data on a monthly basis.    \n  Final Report.  Chapin Hall will prepare a final Regenerations report at the conclusion of \nFiscal Year 2018, the final year of the pilot.   \nE.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved \n  Youth \n  1.   Progress Goals / Target:   \n  The Illinois Pay for Success Pilot, directed to youth dually involved in the child welfare \nand juvenile justice systems, was designed to reduce recidivism and increase placement stability, \neducational achievements and employment opportunities.  The goal for the Illinois Pay for \nSuccess pilot remains unchanged from the Second Triannual Report: to fund the pilot through a \nsocial  impact  bond,  by  which  private  funds  are  used  to  pay  for  the  pilot \nservices.   Implementation  Plan,  pp.  22-25.   The  current  goal  is  to  serve  800  youth  in  the \ntreatment group and 800 youth in the control group over four years.   \n  2.  Status Report:     \nFunding.  The fundraising goal has been extended from July 31, 2017 until October 1, \n2017. During this reporting period, the target fundraising amount has been adjusted from $17 \nmillion  to  $6  million  dollars,  with  the  state  to  fund  the  remainder  amount.  The  original \n27 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 30 of 66 PageID #:2536\n \nfundraising plan was for CCN to put $17 million into an escrow account with the State to make \npayments and draw down from the escrow.  CCN experienced difficulties in raising funds.  The \nState agreed to adjust the fundraising goal to $6 million dollars. In addition, at the behest of \nCCN, the plan was adjusted to place the funds in a guaranteed fund rather than an escrow \naccount.  The need for supplemental funds was not anticipated until the fundraising goal was \nadjusted downward this reporting period.  In order to continue the pilot, the State agreed to \nprovide supplemental funds.   The status of fundraising will be reviewed in mid-September, \n2017.  Exhibit K, Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved Youth, Four Month Status \nReport, August 31, 2017.   \nYouth Served.  The current goal is to serve 800 youth in the treatment group and 800 \nyouth in the control group over four years. The four year period began in November 2016.  There \nare currently 42 youth receiving services as part of the pilot  in Cook, Lake, Franklin and \nJefferson counties.  The pilot has accepted an additional 25 youth since the last reporting period.  \nA total of 95 youth have been served by the project.  Fifty-three of the youth were served \nduring the ramp up period and will not be part of the evaluation that will be conducted at the end \nof the three year evaluation period. The ramp up phase was used to create the systems, including \nintake, referral pathways, database, communication lines between the Department agencies and \nCCN, staffing and training of the Wrap facilitators, and other evidence based therapies. Forty-\ntwo youth (including the 25 youth served during this reporting period) have been served during  \nthe pilot and will be evaluated at the end of the evaluation period.  \n   Evaluation.  The Second Triannual Report stated that the University of Michigan would \nnot be evaluating the program performance during the ramp up phase since the purpose of the \nramp up phase was to develop and work out system-related issues.  There will be an evaluation \nas planned after three years, but not on the 53 youth in the ramp up phase.   \n28 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 31 of 66 PageID #:2537\n \n  In addition, due to the amount of time required to develop the pilot, the Department \ndecided to evaluate the ramp up youth for any trends or results.  The Department asked the \nUniversity of Michigan, the pilot evaluator, to prepare an evaluation of the 53 ramp up youth \ncompared  to  the  control  group  during  that  time.  The  evaluation  and  a  description  of  the \ninterventions utilized are attached.  Exhibit K, Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved \nYouth, Four Month Status Report, Attachments A and B, August 31, 2017.  The evaluators \nconcluded that the results are positive.  The evaluation design for the ramp up youth was to \nevaluate one year after participation in the program to see if there are any trends in placement for \nthe ramp up youth. The summary of those findings is below and the evaluation is attached along \nwith a description of the interventions. Exhibit K at pp. 1-2 & Exhibits A and B.  Those findings \nare as follows:  \n  21% decrease in congregate care days for youth in treatment group compared to \ncontrol group; \n  58% decrease in detention days for youth in treatment group compared to control \ngroup; \n  The overall risk of having even one day in congregate care decreased by 22% for \nthe treatment group; \n  The overall risk of having even one day in detention decreased by 17% for the \ntreatment group. \n     \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \nFunding.    Securing  funding  remains  an  ongoing  challenge.  Both  DCFS  and  the \nGovernor’s Office continue to provide support to CCN in their fundraising presentations.  If \nCCN’s fundraising goal of $6 million is not met, the goal is to be reconsidered during the next \nreporting period.  The downward adjustment from $17 million to $6 million was based on CCN’s \nassessment of its fundraising capacity.  \nYouth Served.    The current goal remains to serve 800 youth in the treatment group and \n800 youth in the control group over four years. \n29 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 32 of 66 PageID #:2538\n \nProgram Refinement.  As noted in the Second Triannual Report, CCN raised concerns \nabout delayed referrals of youth who may be eligible for the program due to lack of timely \ncompletion of Unusual Incident Reports (UIRs).  DCFS had identified this as a system-wide \nissue and replaced the UIR system with the Significant Event Reporting System (SERS).  SERS  \nis linked to the SACWIS system and provides timely updates to significant events that occur in a \nyouth’s case.  CCN can access the information directly from SERS.  This alleviates delay in \nreferrals to CCN.   DCFS will continue to monitor SERS  to ensure that the change from the UIR \nsystem to SERS has addressed the problems identified in the UIR reporting system.  Work \ncontinues on automating this function.    \nDashboard.   The Pay for Success dashboard was tested and validated by the University \nof Michigan during this reporting period.    \n  F.  Panel Recommendation #2 \nCreate  four  “immersion  sites”  of  small  geographic  areas  that  coincide  with  judicial \ncircuits to fully build, test and implement a core practice model that puts children and families at \nthe center of service planning and builds community and home-based services for children and \ntheir families. (Implementation Plan at pp. 25-38).    \n1.  Project Goals / Target: \nImmersion sites are test or pilot sites representing a small geographic area where youth, \nbirth parents, foster parents, DCFS staff, private agency staff and multiple other stakeholders \nwork together to fully build and implement a “core practice model” of child welfare practice that \nputs children and families at the center of service planning and builds community and home \nbased resources to service children and families.  To date, the immersion site process has started \nin four cities:  Lake County, St. Clair County, the Rock Island area (including Rock Island, \nWhiteside, Mercer, and Henry counties), and the five “Mount Vernon area” counties (Clay, \n30 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 33 of 66 PageID #:2539\n \nHamilton,  Jefferson,  Marion,  and  Wayne).    Exhibit  L,  Four  Month  Status  Report:  \nImmersion/Innovation Sites Pilot, August 31, 2017.    \nMoSP  Training.  The  delivery  date  for  the  Model  of  Supervisory  Practice  (MoSP) \ntraining was November, 2017, but has been extended to December, 2017.  The training will \ninclude a combination of classroom training and individual coaching.  Initial presentation of the \ntraining in Immersion sites is currently scheduled to begin in December.  A training schedule \nremains to be developed during the next reporting period.  \nCFTM Training.  In June 2017, one day Leadership Summits were scheduled in each \nImmersion Site.  The first round of CFTM training was planned to commence in July or August \n2017 in each Immersion Site.   \nQSR Training and Implementation.  The CWG contract also provides for training and \nsupport for the QSR process.  CWG recommends that the training be done in parts:  an initial \ntraining, participation in an on-site review and, after the conclusion of three on-site reviews with \nthe participation of a CWG mentor, additional advanced training that will prepare them to \nbecome a mentor/trainer in the QSR process going forward.   \nOffice Realignment with Judicial Circuits.  DCFS developed a plan to align regional \nand field offices with judicial circuits.  It was anticipated that the plan would be ready for review \nby the Director and for union negotiations by March 31, 2017.   \nRestructuring and Decentralization.  DCFS continues to work on structural issues to \nbetter align with practice goals and expectations in the Immersion Sites.   \n  2.  Status Report: \n31 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 34 of 66 PageID #:2540\n \n  DCFS has experienced increases in adoption and guardianships across the state and in the \nimmersion sites1 since the submission of the First Triannual Status Report to the Court.      \no  Adoptions increased by 37% in the balance of the state and increased by 49% \nin the immersion site. \no  Guardianships increased by 49% in the balance of the state and increased by \n185% in the Immersion Sites. \nReunifications also increased by 14% in the immersion sites.  However, reunifications decreased \nin the balance of the state by 14%.   Exhibit L.  \n  Maltreatment in Care per 100K Days:   \n  The immersion sites demonstrated an improvement in maltreatment in care per 1000 days \nover the past year.  The current rate of maltreatment in care per 100K days is 4.44/100K days, an \nimprovement from the prior rate of 8.51/100K days in foster care.   There was also improvement \nin this measure statewide from 5.3/100K to 5.07/100K days, however this improvement was not \nas large as the improvement in the immersion sites.  Exhibit L. \n  Stability in Care per 1000 Days: There was also improvement in the stability in care \nmeasure.  As with the other measures listed above, the improvement in the immersion sites was \ngreater than in the balance of the state.  The rate of moves in the immersion sites improved to \n2.78 moves/1000 days from 3.98 moves/1000 days while the rate of movement in the balance \nstate demonstrated less improvement and went to 2.93 moves/1000 days from 3.8 moves/1000 \ndays.  Exhibit L.  \n  Procedure 315:  Training on Procedure 315 has been provided to all individuals required \nto have this training. Exhibit L. \n  FTS: 98.6% of the required individuals have been trained.  Exhibit L. \n                                                 \n1 This analysis is based on overall performance data for non-Cook and non-Immersion site \nbalance of the state downstate counties as a comparison group for the Immersion/Innovation \nsites. Exhibit L.   \n32 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 35 of 66 PageID #:2541\n \n  MoSP:  MoSP training is projected to begin in December 2017. The goal of the MoSP \ntraining will be to train and coach supervisors on effective supervisory practices and this training \nwill be aligned with the CFTM training for supervisors.  Exhibit L. \n  CFTM  /  QSR:    The  CFTM  training  and  coach  development  process  is  underway. \nLeadership Summits were held in each of the immersion sites on various dates between June 19 \n– 22, 2017.  The first CFTM three-day training sessions were held in July, 2017. In August, \n2017, the first of four rounds of coaching for the Master Coaches was conducted and a second \nround of coaching was scheduled for September, 2017. It was anticipated that by September 29, \n2017, the 25 Master Coach candidates would have achieved Coach status and the 25 trained as \nfacilitators would have achieved Facilitator status. Additional training and coaching is scheduled \nto be  conducted in October and November, 2017.  It was anticipated that the first 25 Master \nCoaches would be certified by December, 2017, as well as an additional 75 additional coaches \nand facilitators.  However, after the time period covered by this report, fewer Master Coaches \nwere certified for a variety of personnel reasons.  In turn, fewer coaches and facilitators were \ncertified because there were fewer Master Coaches and due to a variety of personnel reasons \nwithin the private agencies.  In addition, some trained individuals await CWG’s approval for \ncertification because CWG determined that further observations would be needed.  It is now \nanticipated that 18 Master Coaches will be certified by December 2017.  CWG has agreed that \nthese 18 Master Coaches will be permitted to coach and develop other Facilitators, Coaches and \nMaster Coaches without further CWG approval.  In addition 12 of the DCFS training staff will \nreceive special training to be Trainers. Once the Trainers and Master Coaches are fully certified, \nDCFS will have ability to progressively move this process statewide under the direction of the \nMaster Coaches.

During the month of June, there \nwere four QSR case reviews with mentors, completed in each immersion site, for a total of 16 \ncases. Paired QSR reviews are occurring each month utilizing the QSR reviewers.  In October, \n2017 an additional three QSR reviewers have been trained with onsite review occurring with \nmentors. These reviews with mentor oversight, will determine whether the QSR reviewers are \nready for the advanced training.   Exhibit L, Appendix B. \n  Intensive Array of Community/In-Home Services:  The contracts for the lead agencies \nfor the intensive array of community/in-home services have been in place since April 2017 and \neach program is fully operational. The DCFS Clinical Division continues to guide development \nand implementation of in-home services. Projections for the number of children served are \nincluded in each contract. The programs and the number of families engaged in services as of the \nend of August, 2017 are:  \n  Spero Family Services, Mount Vernon. 50 families engaged in intensive wrap \naround service or in the nurturing parent in home intensive model as of mid-\nAugust. \n \n  Bethany Family Services, Rock Island. 19 families engaged. \n \n  Nicasa Behavioral Health Services, Lake County. 40 families had been engaged \nas of August. \n \n  Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House, St. Clair County. 19 families have been \nengaged as of August. \n \n  Realignment of Office Areas with Illinois Judicial Circuits.  The realignment of DCFS \nlocal office areas with Illinois judicial circuits will not proceed in light of the extensive work \nrequired to reorganize the DCFS field office structure and the need to reach an agreement with \nthe union to which the vast majority of DCFS employees belong.   \n35 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 38 of 66 PageID #:2544\n \n  Decentralization / Structural Change:  DCFS continues to expand innovations begun \nin the immersion sites.  The current plan is for CIPP assessment and planning process to be \nprogressively  transitioned  into  the  CFTM  process  as  the  CFTM  training  and  coaching  is \nimplemented.  Matching is currently delegated to the immersion sites and the  plan is for the \nmatching process for youth in care to be fully integrated into the CFTM process as the CFTM \ntraining and coaching proceeds. Children and youth with exceptionally complex disabilities will \nbe matched with centralized clinical and placement support   \n  Approval of requests for Norman housing funds have been delegated to the immersion \nsites, including the POS agencies.  \n  The Agency Performance Team has been decentralized and is now under the direction of \nthe regions. \n  In  Fall  2016,  management  for  the  DCFS  Clinical  Division,  the  immersion  sites, \nPlacement Matching and CIPP oversight was integrated under Pete Digre, former Associate \nDirector. This led to a significant improvement in increased clinical attention on DCFS’s most \ncomplex children and youth.   \n  Improved  case-flow  and  day-to-day  operational  processes  by  changing  rules, \npolicies,  practices  and  operational  procedures  that  have  proven  to  be  ineffective  or \nredundant, and which hinder achieving permanency outcomes for children and youth.   \nNumerous process improvements have been made by the immersion sites. This success has led to \nActing Director Walker’s initiation of an overhaul of DCFS rules and administrative procedures \nto lessen the burden on front line workers and to make the overall administration of DCFS more \nintegrated.  \n  Examples of results achieved include: \n36 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 39 of 66 PageID #:2545\n \no  Norman  housing  funding  approval  was  delegated  to  POS  case  management \nagencies. \no  The 11 page “Matching Tool” was eliminated. \no  POS Case Management Agencies were authorized to access the system that tracks \nthe status of adoption and guardianship subsidies. \no  A Guardianship fax line for prompt school consents was opened. \no  Legal  screening  for  court  documents  was  authorized  by  telephone  avoiding \nextensive travel. \no  Adoption Labs were established to allow caseworkers to complete their adoption \nand guardianship paper work with the personal direction and assistance of a \nDCFS adoption expert. \no  Foster care and relative care contracts were amended to provide that private \nproviders make reasonable efforts to ensure that a child’s case remains assigned to \nthe originally assigned worker whenever possible, including when a child moves \nfrom the contracted provider’s foster home to residential treatment, emergency \nfoster care, or shelter. When the agency has made reasonable efforts to maintain \ncase continuity, but a case must be transferred, the agency will ensure that all \naspects  of  the  case  transfer  policy  are  adhered  to.  POS  agencies  are  now \nauthorized to license DCFS recruited foster homes. \no  A reduction in paperwork regarding tracking children’s education was achieved. \no  Modifying the “percentage of referral opportunities” system by pooling the foster \ncare  resources  of  agencies  to  allow  the  best  placement  to  be  selected,    not \nnecessarily the next placement in the rotation. (Lake County) \n \n  The detailed implementation plan for the IV-E Waiver is pending approval by the \nAdministration for Children and Youth.  The impact of the IV-E waiver is to give DCFS \ndiscretion over the use of these federal funds so they will be a portion of the funding for in-home \nservices along with Medicaid. The IV-E Waiver has made additional funds available for FY 18 \nwhich has allowed the expansion of services and training in the Immersion Sites. \n  3.    Goals and Revised Targets: \n  The goals and revised targets for the next reporting period are:    \n  Reformation of the Immersion Site Roll Out Process:  Acting Director Walker takes \nthe  position  that  the  interests  of  youth  in  care  will  be  best  served  by  reformation  of  the \nimmersion site roll out process, and the parties and the Expert Panel have had preliminary \n37 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 40 of 66 PageID #:2546\n \ndiscussions consistent with  the  meet  and  confer  requirement  in  the  Restated B.H.  Consent \nDecree.  The parties and the Expert Panel will continue these discussions as a priority during the \nnext reporting period.  Acting Director Walker views the current immersion sites as innovation \nor research and development sites where five or six initiatives are being tested to determine if \nthose initiatives could develop into systemic changes that can be re-created across the entire \nagency.  Acting Director Walker is committed to the process underlying the Implementation Plan \nof testing various initiatives prior to rolling out a strategy statewide. However, the initiatives in \nthe immersion sites apply only to a small percentage of the children and families served by \nDCFS while urgent needs continue to exist statewide.  While DCFS must continue to work with \nchildren and families within existing resources and strategies, the Implementation Plan can be \nsufficiently flexible and should not constrain DCFS from a wider use of some of the strategies \nbeing tested in the immersion sites as the strategies begin to show positive results.   \n  Outcomes: The following outcome goals for the Immersion Sites will be documented in \nthe next report to the Court:   \no  Safety in care compared to the other non-Cook counties.  \no  Increased numbers of adoptions, guardianships and family reunifications in the \nImmersion Sites compared to the other non-Cook counties. \no  Decreased median average length of stay in foster care and residential care in the \nImmersion Sites compared to the other non-cook Counties.   \no  A reduction in the median days in foster care compared to the other non-Cook \ncounties. \no  Improved permanency within 12, 24, and 36 months of entry into foster care. \no  Improved placement stability compared to the other non-Cook Immersion Sites. \no  Improved child in care well-being as documented in timely EPSDT and dental \nscreenings compared to the other Non-Cook Counties. \n \n  Model  of  Supervisory  Practice  Training:  All  POS  and  DCFS  supervisors  in  the \nImmersion Sites should be trained in the MoSP.  \n  Child and Family Team Meeting Development of Facilitators, Coaches and Master \nCoaches:  Approximately 100 total facilitators, coaches and Master Coaches will be trained, \n38 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 41 of 66 PageID #:2547\n \nincluding the Certification of 25 Master Coaches who are prepared to train additional facilitators, \ncoaches and Master Coaches. The success of this developmental model will be evaluated and a \nplan will be completed. \n  Quality Services Review Evaluation: Eight QSR reviewers will be fully trained and \nproviding QSR reviews. An evaluation of the success of this quality assurance model will be \ncompleted and a plan developed to continue the process of engaging in a different process to \nensure fidelity to the Core Practice Model.   \n  Intensive Array of Services: Each of the Intensive Array of Services will reach full \ncapacity and an initial evaluation of the family outcomes will be documented. \n  IV-E Waiver Plan: The IV-E Waiver Plan will be updated to include the changes \ndescribed in this Four Month Status Report.  \n  Improving Case Flow and Operational Processes: The immersion sites will continue \nto  develop process  and  case  flow  simplifications.    DCFS  will  develop  plans  for  statewide \nimplementation for those process improvements which are demonstrated to have the greatest \nimpact.  \nG.  Panel Recommendation #3: \nFund a set of permanency planning initiatives to improve permanency outcomes for \nadolescents who enter state custody at age 12 or older either by transitioning youth to permanent \nhomes or preparing them for reconnection to their birth families when reaching adulthood.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 38-42.   \n1.  Project Goals/Target  \n  The goal is to decrease the amount of time of youth spend in care and to increase \npermanency  of  youth  through  guardianship  or  adoption  when  youth  are  unable  to  reach \npermanency  through  reunification  with  their  family.  DCFS  has  pursued  two  initiatives  in \n39 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 42 of 66 PageID #:2548\n \naccordance with Panel Recommendation #3:  the Fictive Kin/ State Funded Guardianship; and \nFamily Finding.   The BH Expert Panel reviewed these initiatives and the decision was made to \ncombine them into one report.  Fictive kin and subsidized guardianship were separate initiatives \nbut  the decision was made to consolidate these two initiatives, although there will be separate \ndata generated for each for evaluation purposes.   Family Finding is geared towards locating \nrelatives and fictive kin to provide support to the family.  This can include placement while in \nfoster care or permanency when the child is unable to return home, and reporting on this \ninitiative.  Including Family Finding in the report on Fictive Kin and Subsidized Guardianship \ntherefore made sense.   \n  Family Finding and Expanded Subsidized Guardianship/KinGap previously examined the \npopulation of youth over 12 years old.  The Expert Panel reviewed data for the population of \nyouth over 12 and noted a decline in permanency for those youth. During their review they also \nnoted a delay in permanency for those youth who enter care between birth to three years old in \nCook County, compared to the same population located Downstate.  The population of youth in \ncare who enter care between birth and three years old in Cook County has seen a decline in \nreunification after 36 months in care, so it is hoped that with the use of concurrent planning and \nthe focus of either adoption or guardianship can increase permanency for this population in Cook \nCounty.  At the suggestion of the BH Expert Panel, the younger population, birth to 3 years old, \nhas been added to the pilot, based on the data reviewed in reference to their time in care and \nobtainment  of  permanency.    Exhibit  M,  Amended  Expanded  State  Funded  Guardianships, \nAmended Definition of Fictive Kin and Family Finding  (SG-HFK-FF) Project July 2017, p. 8. \n  The  interim  goals  identified  in  the  last  reporting  period  are  as  follows:  tracking \nplacements and outcomes of youth in fictive kin homes to monitor for safety, stability and \npermanency;  training on Procedure 315 to be completed by June 30, 2017;  clarification and \n40 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 43 of 66 PageID #:2549\n \ncompletion of business rules and data elements for Fictive Kin, State Funded Guardianship/Kin \nGap, and Family Finding; completion of the rulemaking process for Fictive Kin and  Expanded \nState Funded Guardianship;  consolidation of Fictive Kin, Subsidized Guardianship, and Family \nFinding  required development of a combined dashboard.   \n2.  Status Report:    \n  There is an increase in permanencies through adoption and guardianship for the targeted \npopulation (youth 12 and over as well as youth entering care between birth and age three) as well \nas statewide from FY 16 to FY 17.  There has been an overall statewide increase in permanency \nfor all youth in care via adoptions, FY 16 (12.1%) to FY 17 (14.1%), and guardianships, FY 16 \n(2.6%)  compared  to  FY  17  (3.4%).    Specifically  looking  at  the  targeted  populations,  the \nfollowing was observed in the data contained in Mindshare.  For youth entering care at birth \nthrough age 3, 439 youth exited care through adoption in FY 16 compared to 573 in FY 17. Of \nthe youth entering care at birth through age 3, 32 youth exited care through guardianship in \nFY16 compared to 45 in FY 17.  This shows an increase of youth entering care at birth through \nage 3 who gained permanency through both adoption and guardianship. For youth age 12-17, \nthere were 179 youth who exited care through adoption in FY 16 compared to 224 youth in FY \n17.  For youth age 12-17, 129 youth exited care through guardianship in FY 16 compared to 143 \nyouth in FY 17. This shows an increase of youth ages 12-17 who gained permanency through \nboth adoption and guardianship. Exhibit M.  This is positive data.  \n  ACR  reviewers  are  now  required  to  ask  questions  to  identify  if  caseworkers  have \ncompleted Family Finding activities. In addition, ACR reviewers ask a series of question to \ndetermine  whether  older  youth  will  benefit  from  the  expanded  state  funded \nguardianship/KinGap; specifically, those older youth who have current independence goals, and \nthose older youth who do not have any identified resources that would lead to permanency.   \n41 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 44 of 66 PageID #:2550\n \n  Rulemaking for DCFS Rules 300, 301, 302, 304, 309, 315, 328, 337, 338, 359 and 402, \nwhich includes the updated definition of fictive kin, was filed for publication in the Illinois \nRegister  for the required second notice.    Rulemaking for DCFS Rule 302.410 which includes \nthe expanded definition of state funded guardianship, was also filed for publication in the Illinois \nRegister for second notice.  It is anticipated that the rules will be final in the next reporting \nperiod.  \nTraining  on  revised  Procedure  315,  Permanency  Planning,  includes  training  on  the \nexpanded definition of fictive kin.  Training has been completed.  \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  \n  Dashboard.  The consolidation of the fictive kin and subsidized guardianship dashboards  \nwas reviewed with the Office of Information Technology and the Expert Panel and the change in \nbusiness  rule  to  implement  the  consolidation  for  the  dashboard  has  been  requested.    It  is \nanticipated that Mindshare will begin work on those changes by the end of September, 2017. \n  Evaluator.  The lack of an assignment of a program evaluator or university contractual \nsupport to this project has continued to be challenging; however Dr. Mark Testa has offered to \nprovide  assistance with data and data evaluation. Dr. Testa’s inclusion in this process will assist \nin the proper collection of data and identification of measurable outcomes to assure that there is \nevidence of the efficacy of this project.  \n  Improving  casework  and  casework  supervision.      Training  on  Procedure  315  to \nimprove casework and supervision on permanency planning is expected to result in an increase \nin reunification, and data on reunification should show this improvement. This data will be \nreviewed over the next reporting period.   \n \n \n42 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 45 of 66 PageID #:2551\n \n   H.  Panel Recommendation #4: \nRetain an organizational consultant to aid DCFS in “rebooting” a number of stalled \ninitiatives that are intended to address the needs of children and youth with psychological, \nbehavioral  or  emotional  challenges  (Implementation  Plan,  pp.  42-43).  Recommendation  #4 \naddresses two points - DCFS reorganization, and “rebooting” stalled initiatives intended to meet \nthe needs of specific youth.  DCFS identified two initiatives that needed to be “rebooted.”  \nDCFS’s reorganization and those two programs – Birth to Three (IB3) and Safe Families for \nChildren  (SFC)  –  are  discussed  below.    In  addition,  DCFS  identified  various  IT  projects, \nincluding updating or expanding certain information systems and applications and implementing \na data analytics system intended to alert investigators of children at exceptionally high risk of \nserious harm, as part of its response to this Recommendation.  Those projects are also addressed \nbelow.  \nI.  Expert Panel Recommendation # 4: Reorganization \n1.         Project Goals / Target: The Implementation Plan called for DCFS to create \na high level unit with cross-organization authority to develop an implementation plan, manage \nthe  implementation  and  resolve  system  barriers.  It  also  noted  that  the  organizational \nconsultant should evaluate the organizational structure and culture of DCFS; the effectiveness of \nDCFS’  policies,  procedures  and  programs;  the  effectiveness  of  DCFS’s  leadership  and \nmanagerial structure  and  function  and  to  assess  the  supervisory  functions  of  the  agency.   \nImplementation Plan at pp. 42-43. \n2.  Status Report.  Beverly J. Walker was appointed Acting Director of DCFS on \nJune 23, 2017 [Dkt. 551 Notice of Substitution of Defendant Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 25(d)].  Acting Director Walker comes to DCFS with a wealth of child welfare and \npublic sector government experience.

Panel Recommendation # 4:  Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) \n1.  Project Goals / Target: \nThe  Illinois  Birth  Thru  Three  (IB3)  is  a  five-year  federal  demonstration  project \nthat  provides  two  evidence-based  interventions,  singly  or  in  combination  –  Child  Parent \n                                                 \n2 Former Interim Acting Director Lise Spacapan is now General Counsel to the Governor.  \n44 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 47 of 66 PageID #:2553\n \nPsychotherapy (CPP) and Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) – to parents and children in Cook \nCounty, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility, in order to reunify children with their parents more \nquickly and reduce the risk of re-entry to the child welfare system.  Implementation Plan, pp. \n22-26.    DCFS  intends  to  complete  the  five  year  federal  demonstration  project  by \nSeptember 30, 2018, and may seek renewal of the waiver for an additional year.  Second \nTriannual Interim Status Report to the Court.  The goal of the federal demonstration project is to \nreunify children with their parents more quickly and reduce the risk of re-entry to the child \nwelfare system.   \n  2.  Status Report:  The target number of children to be served through the project  \nis 2,400 and currently 2,005 children have been referred to the project, which includes 78 new \ncases during the past fiscal year.  During Fiscal Year 2017, there were 100 CPP referrals, the \nmost referrals in a fiscal year during the demonstration project. Out of the 179 cases that have \nbeen closed across the life of the waiver, 28% have been closed successfully. meaning that the \nfamily has achieved progress in the identified treatment goals. Exhibit R, IB3 Four Month Status \nReport. During Fiscal Year 2017, 55% of the referred participants who were biological parents \nsuccessfully enrolled by completing the intake process and actually attending sessions for NPP \nand 76% of the participants who enrolled successfully completed the program by completing the \nnecessary sessions, engaging in home coaching and completing a post services test.  Id.  \nLack  of  Engagement  by  Birth  and  Foster  Parents.    DCFS developed an on-site \nfield support program for agencies.  The Implementation Support Specialists assist caseworkers \nand supervisors in effective communications with caregivers.   The use of Implementation \nSupport  Specialists  was  helpful,  as  evidenced  by  the  substantial  progress  in  the  NPP \nintervention for foster parents.  At the end of the fiscal year, 50 foster parents completed the \nNPP program  for foster parents by completing the necessary sessions, engaging in home \n45 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 48 of 66 PageID #:2554\n \ncoaching and completing a post-test during the last fiscal year.  DCFS attributes this effort to \nthe Implementation Support Specialists, who focus primarily on engagement of foster parents.   \nEvaluation.  DCFS has contracted with the University of Illinois at Chicago Survey \nResearch Lab (SRL) to evaluate the IB3 program.  The unit of analysis for the evaluation is \nchildren enrolled in the IB3 waiver in Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 15 and SRL began the \nmain study data collection in July 2017.  \n3.  Revised  Targets  /  Goals:  The  IB3  program  is  a  five-year  federal \ndemonstration  project  that was originally scheduled to conclude in September 2018.  DCFS \nrequested and received approval from the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices for the program to continue for an additional year, and that request was granted and so \nthe program may continue until September 30, 2019.  The project will continue to focus on \nmore successful engagement with biological parents and foster parents to improve the number of \nfamilies that successfully complete the targeted interventions of CPP and NPP. The goal of the \nfederal demonstration project is to reunify young children with their parents and prevent re-entry \nto foster care.   \nK.  Recommendation # 4:  SAFE Families for Children (SFC) \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The core objectives of SAFE Families for Children \n(SFC) include deflection of youth from  child  welfare  custody,  child  abuse  prevention,  and \nfamily  support  and  stabilization by providing host families to parents involved in the child \nwelfare system.  Implementation Plan, pp. 44-46.  As noted in the First Interim Triannual Report \nto the Court, the program cannot be evaluated until there are a total of 475 families in the \ncontrol group and 475 families in the comparison group. Due to low engagement, DCFS has \nreexamined and modified the process for engaging families in SFC so that the evaluation can \nbe completed.  SFC has been in place in northern Illinois for over ten years and was expanded \n46 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 49 of 66 PageID #:2555\n \nstatewide in October 2015, but even after that participation in the program has lagged behind \nexpectations. Implementation Plan, pp. 44-46. \n  2.  Status Report:  From April through August 2017, there were 80 referrals to the \nproject.  Forty four of the referrals were identified by the randomizer within the investigation and \nthirty six of the referrals were identified by the second randomizer at SAFE Families.  Exhibit S, \nFour Month Status Report, SAFE Families.  The referrals numbers are on target to meet the goals \npreviously set.  DCFS continues to address the issue of sufficient referrals and this was the main \nfocus of the issues during this reporting period.  In mid-July, DCFS implemented a process by \nwhich an identified DCFS child protection administrator is able to trigger the randomizer within \nthe investigation upon a call from SAFE Families. This process appears to be working since, for \nthe first time, more cases were randomized during the investigation than during the secondary \nrandomizer at SAFE Families.  While the secondary randomizer at SAFE Families is still in use \nafterhours and on weekends, it is no longer the primary source of randomized referrals to the \nproject.  This procedure was implemented to address the issue of duplicate assignments and \navoid issues with crossover cases and pullback cases.  Crossover cases refer to those cases that fall \nwithin both the experimental group and the control group.  Crossover cases could occur due to \nmultiple assignments or reassignment of cases.  Pullback cases are those cases that are assigned to \nthe control group but then “pulled back” because a family member has been located to care for a \nchild or the investigator determines a child must be taken into protective custody.   \n             The SAFE Families dashboard shows promising trends, using aggregate data from the \ncommencement  of  the  program.  All  downstate  sites  have  lower  custody  events  and  lower \nmaltreatment events within the experimental groups.  The indication rate for families within the \nexperimental group is also lower overall than the control group.  Exhibit S. Families in the \n47 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 50 of 66 PageID #:2556\n \nexperimental group receive a variety of services from SAFE families, notably a host home for the \nchild and parent mentoring.  \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  DCFS will continue to monitor the revised referral and \nallocation process to address concerns regarding the number of referrals to the project, although \nthe recent changes to this process appears to have resolved the referral issue.   The referral and \nallocation process has been centralized through DCFS to eliminate the issue of crossover cases.  \nDCFS will also monitor both crossover cases and pullbacks to continue to develop resolutions \nshould these issues continue.   \n  L.  Panel Recommendation # 4: Information Systems \n \n  1.  Project Goals / Target: \n \nThe Implementation Plan requires DCFS to take a number of steps to enhance or replace \ndata systems to generate more timely, accurate and complete data. \nShort  term  goals,  with  a  targeted  completion  between  March  and  September  2017, \ninclude enhancement of the existing SACWIS system to accept educational data provided by \nISBE and unusual incident reporting from private agencies, as well as improvements in mobile \ntechnology  through  a  mobile  application  for  caseworkers,  on-line  foster  parent  licensing \napplication, and a tablet application for licensing site inspections.  Implementation Plan, pp. \n48-52. \n  Long-term goals, with a targeted completion date of September 2019 include a feasibility \nstudy  with  recommendations  for  DCFS  to  enhance  the  core  case  management  system \n(SACWIS)  or  implement  a  CCWIS  solution  and  implementation  of  predictive  analytics.   \nImplementation  Plan,  pp.  48-52.    Regarding  predictive  analytics,  DCFS  committed  to \nestablishing  an  internal  team  in OITS  to  bring  reporting  needs  and  data  analytics  into  a \ncentrally  managed  organization.  In  the short  term,  DCFS  elected  to  use  Mindshare  as  the \n48 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 51 of 66 PageID #:2557\n \nplatform for its data analytics.  This product allows DCFS to merge and analyze data from \nmultiple environments and produce reports for more informed decision making in a dashboard \nformat.  Ultimately, DCFS intends to establish a statewide enterprise data analytics platform \n(“Enterprise IT”) to reduce reliance on external entities to collect and analyze data to drive \noutcomes. Implementation Plan, pp. 49-51. Achievement of that goal is not anticipated until \nDecember 2018. \n  2.  Status Report: \n \nReplacement of SACWIS:  DCFS awarded a contract to the Public Consulting Group, \nInc. for the feasibility study to replace the SACWIS system with a CCWIS system.  Exhibit T, \nFour Month Status Report, CCWIS; Exhibit U, Contract with the Public Consulting Group, Inc. \nPublic Consulting Group, Inc. is a nationally recognized firm that specializes in planning the \ntransition of child welfare systems to federally certified systems.  \nThe goal is for the CCWIS feasibility study to be completed by September 30, 2018. The \nproject  has  a  series  of  seven  phases.  Phase  I  is  the  Initiating  phase,  which  involves  the \ndevelopment of a statement of work, initial project risks and various procurement meetings.  \nPhase 2 is the Planning phase and involves the development of a communication plan and \nproject schedule, identification of stakeholders and a policy and procedure compliance review.  \nPhase 3 is the Requirements phase, which requires the development of business requirements \nand a business flow process and a matrix for managing the requirement documents.  Phase 4 is \nAlternative Analysis and Cost Benefit analysis phase, which requires the completion of a cost-\nbenefit analysis and an alternatives analysis report.  Phase 5 is Strategic Implementation phase \nand requires completion of a feasibility study and recommendation document, a gap analysis \ndocument, an architectural design, a technical design and an implementation roadmap. Phase 6 \nis the Procurement Support Activities phase which involves the development by DCFS, with the \n49 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 52 of 66 PageID #:2558\n \nassistance of the Public Consulting Group, of an Implementation Advance Planning Document \nto the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) regarding the CCWIS system.  An \nImplementation  Advance  Planning  Document  is  a  written  plan  of  action  for  designing, \ndeveloping and implementing the CCWIS system which must be submitted and approved by  \nACF to secure additional federal  funding for the CCWIS system. Phase 7, the final phase, is the \nsubmission the summary report.  Exhibit V, Contract with the Public Consulting Group, Inc.  \nDCFS did not renew its contract with Five Points Consulting Group. \nMindshare. The contract with Mindshare began in September 2015 and is in place \nthrough January 2018.  At the present time, DCFS is exploring the possibility of developing a \nreplacement  for  the  Mindshare  platform  using  POWERBI  and  MS-SQL  server  engines  in \nhouse.  In preparation for this change, DCFS has acquired the POWERBI product and is in the \nprocess of scheduling training for staff on this product.  DCFS is also considering an extension \nof the contract with Mindshare for the dashboards.   \nShort Term Improvement of Existing SACWIS:    \nMobile Applications: DCFS released version 2 of the Case Access mobile app which \ncontinues to be in use by DCFS staff.  \nDCFS also created an on-line licensing application for foster homes. A controlled roll-\nout of the licensing application commenced in DuPage, Bloomington, McLean, Livingston, \nPeoria, Tazewell and Woodford counties.   DCFS staff continue to work on the controlled roll-\nout of the licensing application and DCFS has received 38 online applications to date. Exhibit C, \nFour Month Status Report, IT Projects, p. 4.  \nDevelopment of the on-line licensing application continues with internal DCFS staff.  \nThe current issues include how to address the need for an applicant who completes the on-line \napplication to provide additional required documentation to DCFS for the processing of the \n50 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 53 of 66 PageID #:2559\n \nlicensing application.   The current expectation is for DCFS licensing staff to continue referring \npotential applicants to the online application at www.fostercare.illinois.gov and make follow up \ncontact after the on-line application is received.    \nTo date, 49 licensing applications have been submitted through the on-line licensing \napplication; 30 applicants did not follow through in response to any follow-up calls or requests \nfor additional documentation, four applications were withdrawn and the remaining applications \nare in various stages of being processed.   \n  Predictive Analytics \n \nThe predictive analytics project developed by Mindshare is up and running and the \ncontract runs through January 2018. DCFS has decided not to expand the predictive analytics \nproject to intact family service cases, but DCFS is implementing a case review process for the \nintact family service cases.  This will incorporate features of the case management review \nassociated with predictive analytics. \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nReplacement of SACWIS.  The contract for the CCWIS Feasibility Study has been \nawarded to Public Consulting Group, Inc. and is in place.  The CCWIS Feasibility Study is due \nto  be completed in June 2018.  \nShort-Term Improvement of Existing SACWIS.  The technical work to create a link \nto  individual  child  data  from  ISB  in  SACWIS  was  started  in  October  2017.    Due  to \nunanticipated technical issues with the web programming interfacing in October, the process \nwill need to be completed in early November 2017.  After the November work has been \ncompleted, a link will be available in an individual youth’s SACWIS case that will allow \ncaseworkers and supervisors access to a youth’s ISBE Student Profile Report for individual \nstudents to be saved or printed. Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report, IT Projects.   \n51 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 54 of 66 PageID #:2560\n \nMobile App  for  Caseworkers.  By the  next  reporting  period,  DCFS  will  have \ndeveloped and implemented a plan for identifying caseworkers who are not using the mobile \napp and for providing the additional support those caseworkers need to adapt to this changed \ntechnology.   In addition, DCFS will develop a process for evaluating whether supervisors’ \npractices should be modified as the new technology is routinely used in the field.  DCFS uses a \ncomputer application to monitor progress and other issues. \n  Mobile App for Licensing. Prior to the development of any statewide roll-out, DCFS is  \n \nexploring adding additional forms to the on-line application process to expedite the processing of \nthe application.   Under the current process, an on-line applicant must be sent additional forms to \nbe completed once they have completed the initial on-line application.  Adding the additional \nforms on-line will allow the applicant to complete all the required forms at one time and will \nexpedite the licensing process. A determination regarding the ability to add additional documents \nto the on-line application needs to be made before a statewide roll-out plan is developed.   \nPredictive Analytics.  DCFS did not expand the predictive analytics program to intact \nfamily services.  The Mindshare contracts began in September 2015 and will be in place until \nJanuary 2018.  The Implementation Plan contemplated that Mindshare would provide short term \ntransitional assistance in developing dashboards to view key outcomes in real time and DCFS \ncontinues to explore options to bring this function in-house. \nM.  Panel Recommendation #5: \n \nRestore funding for the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (ISCAW) \nthat uses standardized instruments and assessment scales. Implementation Plan, p. 53. \n1.        Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplated restoration of \nfunding for the ISCAW well-being study.  Implementation Plan, p. 53. \n52 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 55 of 66 PageID #:2561\n \n2.         Status Report:  During this reporting period, the study methods for were \nfinalized, including sampling procedures, informed consent procedures and final choice of all \ninstruments  and  other  data  collection  methods.    The  study  protocol  was  submitted  and \napproved  by  the  institutional  review  boards  of  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago,  the \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and DCFS.  Exhibit V, Four Month Status Report, \nISCAW. \n3.         Revised Targets / Goals:  Data collection is scheduled to begin in October \n2017. Data analysis is currently scheduled to begin in April 2018, A brief initial report is \nanticipated to be completed by the end of Fiscal Year 2018. \nN.  Panel Recommendation #6: \nDevelop and implement a new plan for monitoring residential and group home programs, \nutilizing external partners. (Implementation Plan at p. 53).   \n1.         Project Goals / Target:  The goals set out in the Implementation Plan were \nfor DCFS, with the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University, to develop a \nredesigned residential monitoring program, the goal of which is to increase the safety and well-\nbeing of youth placed  at  residential  treatment  facilities  and  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  \nof  the  residential services provided at the residential treatment facilities.  As described in the \nImplementation  Plan,  the  program  called  for  development  of  regional  multi-disciplinary \nmonitoring teams that would assess residential programs’ effectiveness utilizing multiple data \nsources and inputs.  Residential monitoring teams were to have been identified and training \nwas  to  have  begun  by  December 2016.   Implementation Plan, Exhibit YY [Dkt. 531-51].    \nDCFS partnered with Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Chicago to \ndevelop  an  improved  monitoring  system,  the  Therapeutic  Residential  Performance \nManagement Initiative (TRPMI). Chapin Hall was selected as the evaluator for this initiative.  \n53 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 56 of 66 PageID #:2562\n \nThe TRPMI pilot is designed to enhance youth treatment, progress and well-being as well as to \neffectively monitor, evaluate and promote therapeutic residential program effectiveness,   \n2.         Status   Report:    A   comprehensive   plan   for   TRPMI was developed and \nthree TRPMI pilot teams are in place in the Northern, Southern and Cook regions.  Exhibit W, \nFour Month Status Report, Monitoring Residential and Group Homes, April – July 2017.  \nDCFS executed a contract with Northwestern University and UIC for certain external positions \nfor the TRPMI pilot and with Chapin Hall as the evaluator.  \n  Staffing. The hiring of staff for the all the TRPMI teams was expected to be completed \nby June 30, 2017.  The hiring of all staff for the pilot teams has not yet been completed and \ncontinues to be a challenge. During the pendency of hiring full time staff, DCFS assured \ncoverage of the clinical specialist positions by utilizing internal DCFS to fulfill the role.  The  \nteams consist of the following positions:   \n \n    \nTeam Positions \nSouthern Team  Northern Team  Cook Team \nStatewide Manager \nKaren Sneade (UIC) \nStatewide QI \nSpecialist  TBD (Northwestern) \nData Systems \nDevelopment \nSpecialist  Chris Davidson (Northwestern) .5 FTE \nAshley Albrecht (DCFS) –  Chuck Redeker \nTeam Coordinator \nleaving in October 2017 Eric Smith (DCFS)  (UIC) \nAva Jernigan  Debra McGee \nKimberly Newsome (DCFS)  (DCFS)  (UIC) \nTeam Monitor \nDortha Nickens  Damen Trice \nBill Tourville (DCFS)  (DCFS)  (UIC) \nLinda Karfs (Northwestern)   Pamela McQuaid  Sue Devereux \n.5 FTE  (Northwestern)  (NW) \nClinical Specialist \nDeanna Hall \nTBD (Northwestern)  TBD (Northwestern)  (NW) \nQI Specialist  TBD (Northwestern) .5 FTE  TBD (Northwestern) 1 FTE \n \n54 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 57 of 66 PageID #:2563\n \n= Current vacancies (Northwestern contract) \n \nThe TRPMI teams currently have the following vacancies for the external positions: \n \n  Statewide QI Specialist – 1 Full Time Employee (FTE) \n  Clinical Specialist- 2.5 FTE \n  QI Specialist – 1.5 FTE \n  Data Systems Development Specialist - .15 FTE \n \nThe vacancies in the external positions exist for several reasons.  During the summer months, \nbecause of indications that two of the team coordinator positions, which are staffed by DCFS \nemployees, would become vacant, TRPMI staff requested that the team coordinator positions be \nfilled with external personnel.  TRPMI staff was also considering options for restructuring the \npilots and the restructuring was going to require additional external headcount.   On July 14, \n2017, DCFS informed TRPMI staff that the six vacant external positions should be filled, that \nteam coordinator positions would remain DCFS employees, in order to allow DCFS to build \ninternal capacity, and that the decision on additional external positions was on hold pending \npilot results after the filling of the already existing vacancies.  \n  During the last reporting period, DCFS provided internal DCFS staff to the support the \nTRPMI  teams.  This  staff  included  three  full  time  DCFS  clinical  staff;  one  retired  DCFS \nemployee (who was previously employed as a residential monitoring manager), who worked on \nthe pilot on a 75 day contract; five part time, contracted Clinical Psychologists; two part time \ndata staff (one staff member who worked only through June) and one part time data staff with \nwhom DCFS individually contracted, who were all assigned to the TRPMI pilot.    \n  Step-Down  and  TRPMI  Involvement  in  Child  and  Family  Team  Meetings \n(CFTMS).  The  goals  of  the  TRPMI  pilot  include  identifying  youth  who  are  ready  or \napproaching readiness for discharge, improving the step down planning process and promoting \nthe development of the CFTM as the staffing process that drives discharge planning for youth.    \n55 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 58 of 66 PageID #:2564\n \nDuring this reporting period, TRPMI staff participated in 91 CFTMs.  The CFTMs attended by \nTRPMI staff were frequently not conducted consistently with the new DCFS CFTM model.  \nAdditionally, significant TRPMI resources were devoted to working on individual cases in order \nto get services and placements in place. Exhibit W. \n  Communication  Protocol  and  Youth  Advisory  Council.    Implementation  of  the \nCommunications Protocol and the engagement of a youth advisory council were temporarily \npostponed until additional staff were hired for the TRPMI pilot teams.  \nIdentification of Systemic Barriers and Plans to Address those Barriers. The TRPMI \npilots continue to identify and encounter systemic barriers that impede the progress of the pilot \nand have historically impeded the efforts of traditional monitoring teams.  These issues include \nlack of community based resources, supports and services, staffing shortages, lack of an adequate \ndata system and training issues for monitoring and residential staff.  To address these systemic \nand historical issues, TRPMI will track and analyze recurring system related barriers that impact \nthe ability of youth to step-down from residential treatment facilities, including the availability of \nplacements and community based supportive services.   \n   Another systemic barrier identified by TRPMI is a lack of residential treatment options \nfor the most challenging youth with severe mental health, behavioral problems and increasingly, \njuvenile justice involvement.  These service deficits lead to an increasing number of placements \nof youth in out of state placements and youth going through a revolving door of residential \nplacements which may lead to unsafe conditions in residential programs.  TRPMI is surveying \nstates, such as New Jersey, that have mature systems of care, with the hope of providing \nfindings and recommendations.  \n  Another system issue involves delays in matching and placing youth to foster care \nplacements when they are ready to step-down from a residential treatment facilities.  This barrier \n56 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 59 of 66 PageID #:2565\n \nresults in youth being placed in residential treatment facilities for long periods of time, a \nsituation that often to an exacerbation of behavioral issues.  A recent TRPMI report found that \nresources, including placement resources, are a barrier for roughly 60% of youth ready for \ndischarge from a residential treatment facility. \n  There are sixteen residential agencies currently involved in the TRPMI Pilot.  Eight of \nthose agencies require either enhanced or intensive levels of monitoring intervention. Two \nagencies improved their status during this reporting period and two agencies required more \nintensive attention. The TRPMI teams continue to devote significant resources to these agencies.  \n \nAgency Monitoring Plans \nCensus  Regular  Enhanced  Intensive \nTeam  Agency  8/14/17  Monitoring  Monitoring  Monitoring \nCHASI Rice  35  XX     \nIbukun  5  XX     \nLawrence Hall  39    XX   \nThresholds  25  XX     \nCook   UCAN  69    XX   \nAllendale  62    XX   \nArden Shore  8  XX     \nLittle City  15    XX   \nLutherbrook  3    XX   \nNorthern   One Hope United  10    XX   \nCatholic Children’s \nHome  8    XX   \nEgyptian - Circle of \nHope  Program Closed \nFive Star Industries  3  XX     \nHoyleton  42  XX     \nSouthern  \nOne Hope United \nHudelson  31  XX     \nSpero  15  XX     \nSt. John Bosco  26    XX   \nTCI  36  XX     \n57 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 60 of 66 PageID #:2566\n \n  During the initial stages of the pilot, there is one preliminary proximal outcome of \ninterest.  Exhibit  W.  This  figure  shows  that  during  the  pre-TRPMI  implementation  period \nbetween January 2008 and March 2016, the non-TRPMI program groups, on average, had a \nsignificantly higher rate of substantiated investigations than the TRPMI program groups. There \nappears to be a lower rate of substantiated child abuse and neglect investigations for program \ngroups in the TRPMI pilot sites and while the rate of substantiated investigations for both \nprograms in the TRPMI pilot and programs not in the TRPMI pilot were on an increase, the \nprograms not in the TRPMI pilot rose at a greater rate. Exhibit W. \n Dashboard/CASII (Child Adolescent Services Intensity Instrument) \n \n A  CASII  roster  page  providing  an  at-a-glance  view  of  all  youths’  CASII  scores, \nrecommended service level, and recommendations on level of care  is complete and in use.   This \ndata is used to support discharge planning for youth entering residential treatment.  As part of \nthis process, TRPMI staff can determine if recommendations are addressed and implemented, \nestablishing accountability and prompting Child and Family Team Meetings.  TRPMI will be \nsystematically assessing fidelity of the CASII and the discharge planning process.   \n  The Mindshare dashboard for youth in congregate care is complete.  Some data from that \ndashboard are being used to update the TRPMI Sharepoint site. \n  Program Evaluation.  During this reporting period, the evaluation plan for TRMPI has \nbeen modified.  The initial evaluation plan used a cross-sectional pre-test/post-team design for a \ncalendar year (2016) defined as the baseline year (pre-test) and another calendar year (2018) \ndefined as a post-test year.  However, due to the changes in monitoring residential treatment \nfacilities,  the  evaluation  plan  has  been  changed  to  an  interrupted  time  series  design.    An \ninterrupted time series design allows the evaluators to better control for changes over time that \nmay be independent of the TRPMI intervention.  This design also allows more flexibility in \n58 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 61 of 66 PageID #:2567\n \ndefining a baseline point or points, which allows for a more accurate reflection of various \nimplementation milestones, such as hiring of all clinical staff. The change has been approved by \nthe TRPMI Steering Committee and the Expert Panel.  \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nStaffing.   Several qualified candidates for the Clinical Specialists have been identified \nand it is anticipated the employment offers will be made to those candidates.  Other key positions  \nthat are filled include the Quality Improvement Specialists, who will serve as the collector, \nintegrator and disseminator  of the quantitative and qualitative data that is collected, and  Data \nSystems Development Specialist, who will support TRPMI in the initial implementation and \ndevelopment of data collection and reporting, who will be working on less than full time.      \nThere remains room in the contract for the hiring of an additional data person.   \nStep-Down  and  TRPMI  Involvement  in  CFTMs.    There  was  an  increase  in  the \nnumber of CFTMs that TRPMI staff attended during this reporting period.   \nDashboard.  The CASII data collection function is in use and the congregate care \ndashboard is also in use.  DCFS has provided data staff support beyond the currently approved \nTRPMI contract.  DCFS approved a request to allow OITS staff to assist with the development \nof a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database management system as this system \nwill ultimately support monitoring efforts statewide.   \n  Program Evaluation.  The evaluation has been modified. The current evaluation plan is \nfor an interrupted time series design that accounts for changes in implementation over the course \nof the study.   Members of the evaluation team are participating in an ad hoc workgroup with the \nImplementation  Sub-committee  to  refine,  organize,  and  link  study  activities  to  measurable \noutputs. At this time Chapin Hall is unable to test for statistical differences or draw conclusions \nabout the effectiveness of the pilot. \n59 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 62 of 66 PageID #:2568\n \nIV.  Communication Plan:  Implement a Defined Communication Plan with the B.H. \n  Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ Attorneys.  (Implementation Plan, p. 55). \n  1.  Progress Goals / Target:  A Communication Plan, entered by the Court on \nSeptember 28, 2016 [Dkt. 530], provides for bi-weekly conferences with the Expert Panel and \nthe Parties, during which the pilots and programs identified in the Implementation Plan are \ndiscussed.  The plan provides for DCFS to provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel which details the specific steps that have been taken in actual implementation \nof each initiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers \nthat exist and strategies to eliminate or resolve the barriers, and an evaluation of program results.  \nThe Plan also provides for DCFS to make efforts proactively to share information “beyond that \nwhich directly relates to the specific initiatives described in the Implementation Plan” that \nnevertheless is significant.  DCFS will continue in its efforts to comply with all requirements of \nthe Communication Plan. \n  2.  Status Report:  During this reporting period, all required telephone conferences \nand  meetings  have  been  held  and  monthly  reports  have  been  produced  and  posted  on  a \nSharepoint site to which the parties and the Expert Panel have access. Regular Tuesday bi-\nweekly calls were held. The purpose of these calls was for the DCFS project managers to provide \nregular updates on the pilot projects in the B.H. Implementation Plan. Generally, attendees \nincluded the project managers, some of the evaluators, other DCFS employees, the Expert Panel \nmembers and Plaintiffs’ counsel.  There are in excess of 40 regular participants.  The expectation \nwas the each project manager would provide an update on their pilot and discuss barriers and \nproblems.  At times, at the suggestion of the Expert Panel, the Expert Panel members would \nprovide “coaching sessions” for various project managers who would go through their projects in \n60 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 63 of 66 PageID #:2569\n \ngreat detail.  In addition, there are regular bi-weekly teleconferences with the parties and the \nExpert Panel.  The Expert Panel routinely prepares an agenda for these calls.  \nThere continue to be instances in which the Experts and the Plaintiffs have flagged a \npotential problem or issue and have asked questions, and DCFS makes its best effort to provide \ntimely responses.     \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  DCFS will continue in its efforts to comply with all \nrequirements of the Communication Plan.  DCFS has modified the format for the bi-weekly \nmeetings to focus on one or two of the major pilots, with attendees limited to those individuals \ninvolved in those specific pilots to encourage an uninhibited discussion of each pilot.  This new \nprocess will be reported on in the next triannual report to the Court.  \nV.  Project for a Target Group of Children and Youth/Enhanced IPS Program Beyond \n  Medical Necessity Pilot \n  1.  Progress  Goals  /  Target:    The  Enhanced  Intensive  Placement  Stabilization \nProgram/Beyond  Medical  Necessity  pilot  was  designed  to  provide  immediate  services  to \nstabilize youth in a home setting after a psychiatric hospitalization. The current pilot provides a \nconsultant that works with the entire treatment team, including the family where the youth is \nplaced, the caseworker, the school and other therapeutic providers, to connect the family with \nintensive community-based services and resources to support the youth and family in order to \nmaintain the placement and prevent future hospitalizations. The pilot is designed to serve up to \n50 youth in care from Cook County placed in a psychiatric hospital whose prior placement was \nin a foster home in Cook County or who is recommended for a placement in a foster home in \nCook County after an Emergency Hospital Staffing (EHS).  DCFS and Kaleidoscope can decide \njointly to expand the capacity of the pilot with additional funding.   \n \n61 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 64 of 66 PageID #:2570\n \n2.  Status Report: \nAs originally conceived, the pilot population was defined as youth determined to be \nbeyond medical necessity in a psychiatric hospital.  Based on the experiences of the three youth \ninitially served, it was determined that an intervention prior to the clinical readiness to discharge \ndate would be more useful.   The Placement Stabilization Consultants are now invited to the \nEmergency Hospital Staffings (EHS) in Cook County for youth who are in a psychiatric hospital \nto permit a better exchange of information about the intervention and the youth.  An Emergency \nHospital Staffing is similar to a CIPP and includes the participation of DCFS Clinical personnel.  The \nEHS is a term of art used for staffing youth in psychiatric hospital settings.  The three possible \noutcomes for the EHS where the Placement Stabilization Consultant participates are:  1) home \nbased services are recommended and the assigned agency will agree to have Kaleidoscope \nprovide the pilot programming through the Placement Stabilization Consultant; 2) home based \nservices are recommended and the assigned private agency is not willing to have Kaleidoscope \nprovide the pilot programming; or 3) home based services are not recommended for the youth.   \nA timeline has been developed for services for this pilot as well.  Once a youth has been \naccepted for the pilot, within the first 30 days, the Placement Stabilization Consultant will \nschedule an initial home visit with the caregiver for a psycho-education assessment, schedule a \nCFTM,  complete  a  CANS  and  the  Enhanced  IPS  assessment  and  develop  service \nrecommendations for distribution to the case agency and other providers working with the youth \nand family. Exhibit Y, Enhanced IPS Assessment; Exhibit Z, Enhanced IPS Service Timeline.     \nDuring the next  90 days, the Placement Stabilization Consultant will have weekly contact with \nthe caseworker and other collaterals, have bi-weekly contact with the caregiver and ensure that a \nCFTM takes place every month or six weeks based on the family’s needs.  \n62 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 65 of 66 PageID #:2571\n \nDCFS  has  a  process  to  provide  enhanced  board  payments  for  caregivers  of  youth \nassigned to the pilot where necessary even if the private agency does not have a specialized \nfoster care contract.   \nHiring.   A second Placement Stabilization Consultant started in September 2017.  The \nPlacement  Stabilization  Consultant  hired  in  May  2017  attended  the  three  day  Child  and \nFamily Team Training in July 2017.   Exhibit X, Four Month Status Report, Target Group of \nChildren and Youth in Psychiatric Hospitals that are at Risk to Become Beyond Medical \nNecessity Pilot.  \nChildren Served.  Ten youth have been assigned to the project since its inception.  The \ngoal of the pilot is to serve 50 youth.  \n  Evaluation.  An evaluator has not yet been identified for the pilot, but DCFS continues \nto explore Chapin Hall as an option. \n  The evaluation will involve a random comparison of a control and experimental group. \nDCFS originally anticipated formalizing the evaluation by July 1, 2017.   The original plan for \nidentifying youth to be assigned to the pilot was based on the last digit of the youth’s DCFS \nID number and the day that the youth’s CIPP or staffing occurs.   DCFS attempted to modify \nthis by identifying the control group as  youth referred for an EHS on a Tuesday and with  a \nDCFS ID ending in an odd digit and the comparison group (treatment as usual group) would \ninclude youth referred for an EHS on a Tuesday and has a DCFS ID ending in an even digit. \nThis method, however, did not result in sufficient referrals to the pilot.  Given the insufficient \nnumber  of  referrals,  a  revised  method  for  identifying  a  comparison  and  control  group  is \ncurrently under discussion.   \n \n \n63 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 564 Filed: 10/30/17 Page 66 of 66 PageID #:2572\n \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals \n \nHiring.  DCFS requested that the recently hired Placement Stabilization Consultant \nattend the Child and Family Team training scheduled for October 2017.  The goal remains for \nKaleidoscope  to  hire  additional  Placement  Stabilization  Consultants.  The  goal  is  for \nKaleidoscope to maintain current staffing patterns through this reporting period.  DCFS will \nutilize Northwestern University to provide CANS comparison and comparison reports for the \npilot and comparison groups.   \nDashboard.  DCFS originally planned to have the  dashboard completed during this \nreporting period. However, since there are ten youth currently assigned to the pilot, and the plan \nis to add five to ten youth as each Placement Stabilization Consultant is hired by Kaleidoscope, \nDCFS is able to use the Psychiatric Hospital Database to track information for this pilot.     \nDuring the next reporting period, DCFS will be working with Kaleidoscope’s Quality \nAssurance Division to develop a system for tracking the frequency of Child and Family Team \nmeetings and CANS scoring.  Northwestern University will provide CANS scoring and reports \nwhich will include the control group population. DCFS will also be re-considering the necessity \nof developing a dashboard for this pilot and a timeline for the development of that dashboard \nshould it be necessary.  \n  Pilot Completion and Evaluation.   The pilot will remain in effect until June 30, 2019.   \nDuring  this  reporting  period.  DCFS  worked  with  Chapin  Hall  to  identify  a  control  and \ncomparison group in order to ensure a method to identify sufficient youth for the control group. \nGiven the focus on developing a method for identification of a control group, DCFS did not \nidentify an evaluator for this pilot during this reporting period; however the evaluation goals and \nobjectives will be a priority for this next reporting period.      \n \n64 ",

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN \n \n  Plaintiffs respectfully provide this Submission addressing the time period covered by the \nFourth Triannual Interim Status Report (the “Fourth Status Report”) filed by the Department of \nChildren & Family Services (“DCFS” or the “Department”). This Submission provides Plaintiffs’ \nview of the Department’s ongoing reform efforts under the current Implementation Plan and, more \ngenerally, under the B.H. Consent Decree.  \nIntroduction \nAs with the last Triannual Report filed in October 2017, neither the Expert Panel nor \nPlaintiffs have joined in the Department’s Status Report. This is a continuing indicator that the \nDepartment’s current implementation efforts are not going well. The Department again received \nan extension of time to submit its Triannual Report, but did not provide Plaintiffs or the Experts \nwith  any  drafts  in  advance  to  allow  review,  comments,  and  verification  of  accuracy.  The \nDepartment told Plaintiffs and the Experts that it would provide the first of the piecemeal drafts to \nthem on Friday, March 2. When nothing had been sent by the morning of March 6, Plaintiffs asked \nthe Department for an update on the status of its drafts. The Department stated that it would send \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 2 of 23 PageID #:4384\nthe first piece that evening and the remainder the following morning, on March 7. Plaintiffs and \nthe Experts notified the Department that one day was not sufficient time to react to a draft report \nfrom the Department and the Department confirmed that it would include that fact in its report. \nThe Department did not circulate any drafts prior to filing its report on March 8, the day it was due \nto the Court. This did not allow time for any meaningful review, comment, and verification by \nPlaintiffs or the Experts.  \nGiven the Department’s failure to share any drafts in advance, the Experts were not able to \noffer any meaningful input. That theme continues to persist throughout the Department’s overall \nprovision  of  information  to  the  Experts.  The  Department  provides  delayed  or  incomplete \ninformation or ignores completely the Experts’ repeated requests for responses. The Experts have \nreceived a small fraction of the information or updated plans they have requested over the last \nseveral months. The Expert Panel’s overall assessment is that things are so broken, they do not \n(and  will  not)  have  meaningful  consultation  to  offer  on  the  current  projects  and  B.H. \nImplementation Plan (“Implementation Plan” or the “Plan”) until the parties have clarity (by \nagreement or court order) that a different path forward is required, and the Department must \nconcede that. Plaintiffs share the Experts’ views. We feel that implementation of the Plan is at a \ncrossroads and something drastic must change.  \nThe Department’s continued inability to prepare an appropriate draft report for Plaintiffs’ \nand the Experts’ prior review and potential joinder prior to the filing deadline to the Court is \nemblematic of a deeper and more fundamental problem that the Department cannot continue to \nignore and leave unaddressed. While the Department has expressed that it wishes to simplify the \nreport to focus on the outputs and outcomes generated, that effort is impeded by the Department’s \n2 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:4385\nfailure to regularly manage and analyze the initiatives in a thoughtful and cohesive way despite \nregular internal calls, meetings, and reporting. \nTo Plaintiffs’ grave concern, despite the months that have passed since the last Triannual \nReport, the Department’s leadership appears determined not to change its course back to full \nsupport of the Implementation Plan and its initiatives. In many cases, the Department does not \ncommunicate information to the Experts and Plaintiffs that is critical to measuring the progress of \nthe initiatives under the Implementation Plan and making course corrections where necessary. \nWhile the Department more recently expressed support for the Core Practice Model, which it had \nalready committed to in the Implementation Plan, it has yet to provide the final proposed calendar \nfor its core ingredient—Child and Family Team training and coaching. That effort must not be \ndisrupted as it is critical to the collective efficacy of the Core Practice Model immersion process. \nIt is also critical to maintaining and building buy-in and seeing improvement in the field. The \nDepartment also has not confirmed the approval of its proposed schedule by Paul Vincent’s Child \nWelfare Group (“CWG”). The CWG Core Practice Model was hand-picked by the Department \nand CWG is currently working with the Department on training and coaching. \nWhile the Implementation Plan anticipated that the parties would periodically review the \nprogress made toward reform and negotiate appropriate revisions once actionable evidence became \navailable, the Department has prevented that process. After several months, by failing to respond \nto Plaintiffs’ and the Experts’ requests for information, the Department effectively refuses to \ndiscuss or present alternatives to failing initiatives, instead letting them wane while the need for \nservice development to help of hundreds of youth in care goes unmet. This impedes—and \nessentially makes impossible—the achievement of the goals of the Implementation Plan. The \nDepartment still has not produced any formal or written proposals for changing the Implementation \n3 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:4386\nPlan to address the fact that the Predictive Analytics and Pay for Success initiatives have been \ndropped. While Plaintiffs do not object to their being dropped because they were not working, the \nDepartment said it would do something in place of those initiatives to address the needs identified \nby the Experts which prompted the Plan. Plaintiffs have not received commitments in that regard \nand nothing has not been put in front of the Court for approval. Additionally, the Department has \nprovided no written proposals regarding Therapeutic Foster Care (“TFC”) or the Choices Care \nManagement Entity (“CME”) to analyze why they failed and what will be done to advance their \ngoals of placement and service development. The Department has also shown no signs of progress \nin respect to using implementation science and the use of NIRN to assist with implementation \nefforts, despite continuing requests from the Experts in that regard. \nThe Department’s pattern of behavior over the last several months shows no sign of change. \nIt also impedes the development of solutions to roadblocks by failing to address the Experts’ \nrepeated questions and requests for information. The new administration in the Department has \nbeen provided an opportunity to “get on board” with the Court-enforceable Implementation Plan \nand it has refused. It is time for Court intervention. \nPlaintiffs’ Assessment of DCFS’ Reform Efforts Under the Decree \nI.  Inadequate Collaboration Regarding Transition of Youth to Managed Care. \nA critical issue requiring immediate attention is the proposed transition of DCFS youth to \nmanaged care. Another month has passed with no direct communication from the Department \nabout the proposed transition of youth in DCFS care to managed care. In February, Plaintiffs \ninformed the Court that in response to Plaintiffs’ requests to receive information about the \nmanaged care transition, Acting Director Beverly “B.J.” Walker (“AD Walker”) told Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel that they could attend public meetings and find information online. At a public meeting, \n4 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:4387\nEmily Monk, the DCFS project manager for the managed care transition, listed a B.H. working \ngroup as one of several working groups. However, the Department has not invited counsel for \nPlaintiffs and the Expert Panel to participate in the working group. When Plaintiffs brought up the \nB.H. working group at a monthly meeting, the Department and AD Walker claimed they had no \nknowledge of a B.H. working group. At the February Court status, counsel for DCFS stated that \nMarci White would be on at least one working group. Neither she nor Plaintiffs have received any \nupdate on that. \nThe  Department  has  also  failed  to  follow  the  Court’s  instruction  regarding  its \ncommunications about managed care. At the last Court status in February, the Court stated that \nPlaintiffs should not have to guess why they are not being told information or why information is \nnot being shared regarding the managed care contract. The Court directed the Department to let \nPlaintiffs know if it feels they are not entitled to certain information so that Plaintiffs can respond \nand engage in a discussion. However, the Department’s “radio silence” on this issue has continued.  \nPlaintiffs are deeply concerned about the potential impact of managed care on DCFS youth \nand their continuity of care. Plaintiffs’ concern is significantly amplified by the fact that we have \nheard  that  for  unknown  and  unexplained  reasons,  the  contract  between  the  selected  MCO, \nIlliniCare, and the Department of Healthcare and Family Services (“HFS”) covering youth in care \nmay not be signed on the date anticipated (which was to occur this month). While Plaintiffs \ncertainly do not want the contract signed in a rush, Plaintiffs remain in the dark as to the reasons \nfor the delay that apparently will occur. No one from the Department has provided any substantive \ninformation regarding the negotiations or anticipated problems with the program roll out to \nPlaintiffs or the Experts. Plaintiffs have not seen any drafts or been involved in any discussions \nwith the Department or HFS relating to the managed care contract.  Plaintiffs do not want to pick \n5 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:4388\nthe providers or set the rates. We want to make sure that the process provides continuity of care to \nyouth, that adequate service providers are lined up, and that the service providers can actually \noperate under this system. Plaintiffs’ exclusion from discussions about the critical coordination \nand planning necessary to ensure services for youth are not diminished or interrupted is both \ninexplicable and inexcusable. In its FY2019 Budget Briefing, the Department stated that it is \n“anticipating the renewal of contracts with existing providers to ensure continuity of care even as \nproviders also become contract providers to the new managed care entity, IlliniCare.1” However, \nPlaintiffs have no understanding of what planning and activities the Department is engaged in to \nensure such continuity of care, like what short and long term alternative plans are in place in the \nevent provider contracts are not renewed2. Plaintiffs have no assurance that projections regarding \nthe need  for particular  placements, services,  and resources are realistic or that a sufficient \ncomplement of providers will be available and willing or able to participate in serving kids’ needs \nthroughout the State. Additionally, Plaintiffs are very concerned about how lines of authority will \nwork in respect to decision-making for services that will be provided through the MCO and how \nthe Department intends to pick up its responsibility for providing services that are not covered \nthrough the MCO. \nPlaintiffs also have significant concerns about what is being done to ensure that the MCO \nproperly handles issues like pre-clearance for prescription of psychotropic drugs and difficulties \nin retaining kids in psychiatric hospitalization beyond medical necessity. Plaintiffs have heard that \n                                                 \n1 Illinois Department of Children & Family Services, FY 2018 Budget Briefing, at 22, available at \nhttps://www.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/newsandreports/Documents/FY19_BudgetBriefing.pdf. \n2 For example, at one of the public meetings in February, a residential provider informed the \nDepartment that their local hospital will not contract with IlliniCare so their kids would need any \nalternative. DCFS did not have an immediate response for how it planned to deal with that kind of \nsituation, which should be at the forefront of the Department’s planning for purposes of continuity \nof care and fulfilling voids in service area availability. \n6 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:4389\nthe working groups responsible for drafting the contract do not include a psychiatrist. Plaintiffs \nbelieve that a psychiatrist must participate in the working group and provide knowledge and \nexpertise regarding psychotropic medication and other areas critical to children’s behavioral and \npsychological  needs.  When  Plaintiffs  addressed  their  concern  with  the  Department  at  their \nFebruary 5, 2018 monthly meeting, the Department confirmed that there is no psychiatrist in the \nworking groups but said that there is a psychologist with expertise in trauma. In Plaintiffs’ view, \nwhile that individual’s involvement may also be critical to planning, it is not equivalent to the \ninvolvement of a psychiatrist by way of expertise. Plaintiffs and the Experts still do not know \nwhich other individuals are serving in the working groups or what discussions they have engaged \nin to ensure minimal disruption of services and continuity of care for youth once the MCO is in \nplace.  \nRelatedly,  Plaintiffs  and  the  Expert  Panel  are  waiting  to  receive  the  Department’s \nevaluation of the Choices CME pilot which is critically important to informing the managed care \nproposal. The CME was designed to provide care coordination services to children with severe \nand complex behavioral health concerns. It involves care coordination and administration and \noversight of a provider network comprised of community-based providers willing to offer services \nto children and families enrolled in the program. In Plaintiffs’ view, this pilot has failed, an \noutcome which does not bode well for managed care.3 The Department offered to follow up with \n                                                 \n3 In their last Triannual Report, the Department anticipated that the managed care program would \nsupersede the CME:  \nIt is anticipated that a Medicaid managed care program will be implemented for the \nchildren in DCFS’ care beginning as of Fiscal Year 2019; the Choices program will \nbe superseded by that managed care program . . . DCFS and pilot staff continue to \nplan for ongoing service provision to youth upon the conclusion of the pilot period. \nManaged care will provide for the needs of the child to the extent there is Medicaid \ncoverage.”  \n7 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:4390\nlessons learned from the Choices pilot in preparation for the transition to managed care, but has \nnot done so. In its last Triannual Report, the Department stated:  \nAs the transition to Medicaid managed care progresses, the Project Manager plans \nto convene internal meetings as well as meetings with the Expert Panel, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel and other DCFS division representatives. General topics for discussion at \nthose meetings will include decision-making for services to meet the unique needs \nof child welfare involved families, communication between the MCO and the child \nwelfare staff and the manner in which conflicts will be resolved . . . The lessons \nlearned from the Choices pilot include the fact that the child welfare staff and MCO \nneed to both know and acknowledge who will do what for a family and that the \ndecisions need to be driven by the family. Other lessons learned include the need \nfor  consolidation  of  activities,  guidelines  for  payment  of  services,  and \ncollaboration. These areas will also be included in the topics of ongoing discussions \nas the MCO process continues to roll out. \n \nDkt. 564 at 23 (emphasis added). No meetings or discussions with the Experts or Plaintiffs’ counsel \nabout the transition to managed care or lessons learned from the CME have taken place. The \noverarching “lessons learned” articulated above by the Department without explanation of how the \nDepartment will adjust its plans in preparation for the transition to the MCO suggests that no such \nadjustment is happening. Additionally, the Department has said that it is not renewing the Choices \ncontract. The Department reported recently that the evaluator has been having issues interpreting \nand working with the Department’s data. However, the Department has not formally told Plaintiffs \nand the Expert Panel that Choices has run its course. Moreover, the Department has not presented \nan alternative to address the CME goals.  \nIn sum, it is unclear what date the Department has in mind for contract execution or rollout. \nThis change is absolutely critical to the safety and wellbeing of our clients. At the very least, \nPlaintiffs believe they are entitled to be kept informed about the process. Plaintiffs remain open \nand willing to discussing the managed care transition with the Department. However, there is no \n                                                 \nDkt. 564 at 19. \n8 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:4391\nreason  to  believe  the  Department’s  unwillingness  to  share  information  pursuant  to  the \nImplementation Plan and the Consent Decree—or to provide a basis for not sharing—will change. \nThe Department cannot continue to ignore instruction from the Court and leave Plaintiffs and the \nExperts with no way of evaluating whether it is in fact prepared for managed care.  \nII.  Issues Regarding Residential Monitoring.  \nThe  Therapeutic  Residential  Performance  Management  Initiative  (“TRPMI”)  pilot \ncontinues to struggle and the Department’s inaction is deeply troubling. The TRPMI initiative \naddresses assessment of the services provided to youth by residential facilities and provides \nguidance to agencies who are struggling to provide those services at an acceptable level. The youth \nat residential facilities are among the most difficult to serve. In addition, service shortages impact \nthat population most severely, and attempts to address situations where youth in those settings \neither need to step down or are in a facility that cannot safely handle their high-end needs are \ndifficult and time-intensive. Frankly, it is one of the most difficult initiatives to run. \nInadequate staffing and resources provided by the Department continue to be a problem in \nthe pilot. The Department has filled the Team Coordinator position in the Southern Region. \nHowever, the Department has not filled the Team Coordinator position in the Northern Region. \nThat position has been vacant for several months. The Department blames the delay on labor \nnegotiations and has provided no timeframe for when this issue will be resolved or any plan to \nmake sure the pilot is adequately staffed to be carried out in the interim with fidelity to the model. \nThe Experts have told the Department that another alternative is needed in order to implement the \npilot fully in the Northern Region and asked the Department to provide an alternative plan for \naddressing this staffing need in a more timely manner. The Department has not provided an \nalternative plan. The Department is flouting its agreement and responsibility to provide appropriate \n9 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:4392\nand sufficient resources to the initiatives it committed to undertake in the Implementation Plan. \nThat failure makes impossible a true testing of evidence-based practices that the Department \ncommitted to undertake in the Plan. The point of testing evidence-based practices was to be able \nto draw generalizable conclusions about what is working and what is not. The Department is \npreventing that from happening. \nSeveral additional months have passed since the TRPMI team (which includes Dr. Alan \nMorris  and  Deann  Muehlbauer,  MPH,  both  of  UIC)  sent  a  detailed  communication  to  the \nDepartment identifying significant, systemic issues that were serving as barriers to the TRPMI \nprogram implementation. The Department’s response  continues to be deafening silence and \ninaction despite the Experts’ repeated requests for the Department’s formal response to these \ndischarge barriers for  youth  in  TRPMI. The Experts asked for the  Department’s reactions, \nproposals, and plans to address the discharge barriers and asked whether the Department would \nimplement specific strategies to begin addressing some of the barriers outlined. The Department \nhas failed to formally respond, instead apparently using its silence and delay as a substitute for a \nfrank statement of disagreement.  In Plaintiffs’ view, this is a  reflection of the  Department \nleadership’s continuing pattern of ignoring concerns expressed by the Experts and Plaintiffs and \nmaking clear that they do not believe in, agree with, or support certain core principles underlying \nthe Implementation Plan or the initiatives that the Department chose and committed to undertake.  \nIII.  Issues Relating to Insufficient Progress Toward Resource Development  \nThe Department has yet to assess or develop the number of appropriate service resources \nit needs for youth with high-end needs. Subsequently, the problems with youth remaining in \npsychiatric  hospitalization  beyond  medical  necessity,  other  youth  being  unable  to  find \n10 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:4393\naccommodation in residential treatment when needed, and still other youth remaining stuck in \nresidential treatment centers past the point where step down should have occurred all persist.  \nTherapeutic Foster Care (“TFC”).  \nOne of the Department’s key initiatives to develop more community-based therapeutic \nfoster homes that could serve as “step down” placements for youth “stuck” and ready for discharge \nfrom residential placements and/or psychiatric hospitalization continues to fail. The Department \ncannot continue to claim that it is too soon to make a judgment on the TFC initiative’s success. \nPlaintiffs have repeatedly expressed their concern about the Department’s inability to modify or \nreplace TFC in its current form. This is not an initiative the Department will be able to roll out \nstatewide, which was the whole point of the pilot program. It is clear that this initiative is not \ndeveloping needed services and resources for the high-end youth it targeted. And there is nothing \nthat is being done, as far as Plaintiffs can tell, to put something in its place.  \nSeveral months ago, the Expert Panel recommended to the Department and Plaintiffs that \nthe Department strongly consider re-tooling or modifying specialized foster care—for which the \nDepartment budgets over $100 million—as a way to better achieve the desired goals underlying \nthe TFC pilot to create more capacity to serve youth with high-end needs. The Department actually \nexplored doing that several years ago and previously had developed a plan for such changes. \nDuring the February 5, 2018 monthly meeting, the Expert Panel again asked the Department about \nits consideration of specialized foster care. The Department said that DCFS Senior Deputy \nDirector of Clinical & Child Services Michael C. Jones was reviewing the documents previously \nproduced on re-tooling specialized foster care and that the Department did not have a position on \nit yet, despite the fact that multiple individuals involved in the review several years ago are still \nconnected to or working for the Department. The Department stated that it would follow up with \n11 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:4394\nMr. Jones (with no specific timeframe) and would follow up with Plaintiffs and the Experts. \nHowever, the Department stated that any plans to revise the specialized foster care program would \nnot be proposed as part of revisions to the Implementation Plan since that program was not part of \nthe original Implementation Plan. We and the Experts strongly disagree. As with other promises \nfrom the Department to follow up, the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs have heard nothing.  \nThe Department has also stated that it is considering discontinuation of some aspects of its \nTFC pilots and may explore piloting a new model. The Department has not committed either way, \nnor has it come up with a different alternative for developing services, placements, and resources \nfor  these  youth.  Plaintiffs  believe  that  the  Department  has  a  higher  obligation  under  the \nImplementation Plan to address these issues. The parties are already well past the point in time \nwhen there should have been substantive work done on a new project and its method for rollout. \nPlaintiffs and the Experts are concerned that the Department is not engaged in the work required \nfor wider system reform and focuses on specific program proposals to create contracts for more \nbeds without thinking about it as part of overall system design.  \nThere also appears to be a fundamental disagreement between Plaintiffs and the Experts \non one hand and the Department on the other in respect to the replacement of failing initiatives \nlike TFC. From Plaintiffs’ and the Experts’ perspective, the Expert Report identifies areas of need \nand  sets  out  goals  for  the  Department.  The  Implementation  Plan  includes  initiatives  the \nDepartment agreed and committed to in order to achieve those goals. Part of the Department’s \ncommitment was that if the initiatives did not work, it would try something else. A next effort at \naddressing the goals of TFC to fill the dearth of resources available to kids with significant needs—\nwhether it is a re-tooling of specialized foster care or something else—should be included in the \n12 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:4395\nImplementation Plan. As far as Plaintiffs and the Experts are concerned, that is part of the \nDepartment’s effort in achieving the goals identified by the Expert Report and the Plan.  \nPlaintiffs see no indication that the Department has made any progress in developing \nnecessary step-down resources through TFC or otherwise. For example, at the last Court status, \nthe Department reported that 43 youth were placed outside of the state.4 Nor has the Department \ngenerated data (to our knowledge) that measures the need for such resources, which is even more \nconcerning in the face of planning required for the proposed managed care transition. Again, \nPlaintiffs hope that the Department will reexamine its approach to these issues and choose to work \ncooperatively in partnership with the Experts in order to shift the direction of the Department’s \ncurrent efforts. \nIV.  Issues Relating to the Core Practice Model and Immersion Sites. \nWhile AD Walker has expressed her strong commitment to the use of the Core Practice \nModel,  the  Department’s  delayed  actions  and  incomplete  plans  do  not  fully  reflect  that \ncommitment. The Department has not provided Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel with a final \nproposed extended schedule for Child and Family Team training, which is at the center of the Core \nPractice Model the Department committed to adopting across the state. Additionally, it is unclear \nwhether the Department’s revised schedule follows the CWG’s recommendations. Plaintiffs are \nconcerned that the Department is not regularly checking in with CWG and following its guidance, \nwhich Plaintiffs view as critical to the Department maintaining fidelity to the model. The Experts \n                                                 \n4 At the February 8, 2018 Court status, the Department asked Plaintiffs to provide a write-up \nshowing the bases for Plaintiffs’ concerns regarding youth being place at out-of-state facilities run \nby Acadia Healthcare Corporation. B.H. Status Hearing Transcript 7:13-25, 8:1-24, February 8, \n2018. On February 22, 2018, Plaintiffs provided a memorandum describing these concerns and \narticles about investigations into the relevant facilities to the Department. The Department has not \nresponded to that memorandum. \n13 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:4396\nhave expressed concern as to whether sufficient resources and time are being committed to \ncoaching workers to become facilitators of Child and Family Teams and whether the Child and \nFamily Teams are actually taking place. These are measures of whether the rubber is meeting the \nroad in respect to implementing the Core Practice Model. Despite requests to be provided with the \nDepartment’s new proposed schedule for coaching and training and notice of when that schedule \nhas been approved by CWG, Plaintiffs simply have not been informed.  \nIn December, CWG provided several recommendations for completing the work already \nunderway in the immersion sites. The Experts have repeatedly asked the Department to formally \nrespond to whether it agrees with or accepts those recommendations and to provide its alternative \nproposal(s)  for  addressing  the  needs  identified  in  CWG’s  recommendations.  Again,  the \nDepartment has provided no formal response.  \nThe Department has proposed a modification to the rollout of the Core Practice Model to \nexpand coaching and training by provider agency instead of by county. While Plaintiffs remain \nopen to discussing this idea as long as it is consistent with CWG’s guidance on timing and pace, \nthe Department has not yet presented anything in writing describing a plan for what the change \nwould entail and it how would affect the anticipated rollout schedule. Some of the concerns raised \nby Plaintiffs and the Experts are whether such a rollout would be consistent with the Core Practice \nModel approach to casework since youth—especially those with high-end needs—might move \nbetween agencies within the same county. Plaintiffs and the Experts also raised concerns about \nhow development of the service array might require different funding structures if done by agency \nrather than geographically. Plaintiffs requested that the Department check with Paul Vincent and \nCWG regarding the possible change and also provide Plaintiffs with a written proposal and \nadditional documentation regarding the proposed switch. The Department has not confirmed that \n14 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:4397\nit conferred with Paul Vincent or that he has approved the proposed rollout, nor have they provided \na written proposal. \nOf critical import, the Department must also adequately preview this substantive change to \nthe  immersion  site  process  to  the  federal  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \nAdministration  for  Children  and  Families  Administration  on  Children  Youth  and  Families \nChildren’s Bureau in order to extend its Title IV-E Waiver for out-of-home care funds to develop \nand build an intensive array of services in the immersion sites. The Department relies in large part \non the waiver funds to support and evaluate the immersion site process of more intensive child \nwelfare services for foster youth in the immersion sites. In its budget briefing, the Department \nnoted that it estimates the waiver will produce an additional federal benefit of approximately $26 \nmillion in FY19, assuming its application is approved for extension beyond June 30, 2018.5 \nPlaintiffs understand that the waiver extension application is due March 30, 2018. This due date \nwas raised in a monthly meeting with the Department after the Experts raised questions about the \nstatus of the IV-E Waiver. At the February 5, 2018 monthly meeting, the Department expressed \nconcern that it would not be able to provide Plaintiffs and the Experts with the level of detail \nrequired to approve the change to the Core Practice Model rollout prior to the waiver application \ndeadline. Plaintiffs and the Experts understand and appreciate the time-sensitivity of the waiver \napplication. They told the Department that in the interim, broad statements of commitment with \nregard to  maintaining fidelity to  the CWG model  and following CWG guidance would be \nacceptable with  the expectation  that those promises  would be honored by the Department. \n                                                 \n5 Illinois Department of Children & Family Services, FY 2018 Budget Briefing, at 3, available at \nhttps://www.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/newsandreports/Documents/FY19_BudgetBriefing.pdf \n(emphasis added).  \n15 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:4398\nHowever, the Department has not provided Plaintiffs and the Experts with anything in writing that \nmakes those broad commitments.  \nAt the February 5, 2018 monthly meeting, the Department also presented a proposal for a \nchange to the Implementation Plan regarding the Quality Service Review (“QSR”) process, which \nis part of the Core Practice Model. While Plaintiffs appreciate the Department raising issues for \ndiscussion, the Department did not add this as an agenda item prior to the meeting, which would \nhave assisted in preparation for discussion. Additionally, while the decision to make the change \nwas presented from Plaintiffs’ perspective as a fait accompli, the Department did not present any \nwritten material to accompany its proposal nor had they discussed with CWG the proposal or \nrelated issues like how the QSR change might affect the Core Practice Model rollout, child and \nfamily teaming, or the effectiveness of service planning. Plaintiffs do not raise this issue to criticize \nthe Department’s desire to consider alternative proposals to the initiatives in the plan. However, \nPlaintiffs believe it is a reflection of the compounded problem of 1) the Department’s rush to scale \nback initiatives in the Implementation Plan without the careful deliberation, thought, and analysis \nrequired (including consideration of the rationales for choosing them at the outset); and 2) the \nDepartment’s refusal to provide information to the Experts that would enable the Experts to \nprovide  the  much-needed  feedback  and  guidance  in  decision-making  that  prompted  their \nappointment.  \nV.  Mindshare and Information Technology Issues. \nThe Department originally elected to retain Mindshare to assist in developing various \n“dashboards” for initiatives in the Implementation Plan. The dashboards were a vehicle for \ndrawing information from multiple databases containing information about youth in care and \nmaking that data more readily accessible. The intent was to allow the Department to evaluate the \n16 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:4399\nefficacy of the initiatives it was road-testing under the Implementation Plan, to assess quality of \nservice provision, and to improve its ability to identify the needs of youth in care so that rational \nplanning for program development could occur. \nWhile Plaintiffs received the update that the Mindshare contract has been renewed, we do \nnot know the scope of their work while the Department is developing its proposed replacement for \nthe Mindshare platform using POWERBI and MS-SQL server engines “in house.” The Department \nhas not presented a plan for ensuring the data needed for ongoing review and evaluation of the \nprojects is available until the Department’s alternative platform is up and running. After months \nof  requests  from  Plaintiffs  and  the  Experts  about  the  status  of  the  Mindshare  dashboards \ncontemplated by the Implementation Plan, the Department has not provided information about the \ndashboards it plans to discontinue or which it plans to modify. Without this information, Plaintiffs \nand—more  importantly—the  Experts  cannot  provide  input  or  guidance  about  potential \nconsequences of those proposed modifications or course corrections that should be implemented. \nAgain, the Department’s obstruction by silence pervades. A change regarding which dashboards \nthe Department will produce would require a modification of the Implementation Plan, which the \nDepartment has not proposed. The Mindshare dashboards are critical to the evaluation of the \ninitiatives in the Plan. Any transition of platforms needs to be done in a planned and thoughtful \nmanner so that there is no lapse of information and IT development. No such transition planning \nor explanation in respect to the dashboards has been presented to Plaintiffs or the Experts.  \nVI.  Communication and Cooperation.  \nDespite a lengthy meeting between the parties on February 5, 2018 addressing some of the \ncommunication breakdowns between the parties and Experts, the Department continues to either \ncompletely disregard information requests from Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel or employs delay \n17 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 18 of 23 PageID #:4400\ntactics in providing information,6 as described throughout this submission. Other times, the \ninformation that the Department provides is incomplete or inaccurate. This leaves the Experts \nwithout the critical information they need to fulfill their Court-appointed roles in determining \nwhether the Department is progressing in respect to the goals of the Implementation Plan and \nengaging in the critical analysis necessary to move things forward in a cohesive manner. The \nDepartment’s repeated lack of response suggests that the Department is not engaged in such an \nanalysis or refuses to cooperate under the terms of the Implementation Plan.  \nThe Department often shuts out Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel from what the Department \nclaims are “internal” discussions, including when Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel request to work \nwith the Department to review drafts and proposals before the Department makes a final decision \nregarding possible modifications to an initiative or pilot. Plaintiffs and the Experts have no \nobjection to the Department conducting “internal” discussions. But after such discussions take \nplace, there is no reason for the Department to refuse to provide information that the Plaintiffs or \nthe Experts have requested. For example, AD Walker convenes a weekly call on whom she refers \nto as “stuck kids.” Based on Plaintiffs’ understanding, these youth are often if not always within \nthe  category  of  youth  who  are  in  residential  treatment  centers  or  who  are  psychiatrically \nhospitalized in need of a “step down” placement—some of the very youth the Expert Report and \nImplementation Plan identify as being in severe need of an expanded service array. When Marci \nWhite asked to participate on the calls, the Department declined. She then asked if she could \nreceive a list of the youth who were the subject of the calls so she could independently track their \n                                                 \n6 At the November 2017 status hearing before the Court discussing the Third Triannual Report, \nthe parties reported that the Department had agreed to work with Plaintiffs to identify an individual \npoint person to manage and respond to Plaintiffs’ requests for data and updates. The Department \nhas not confirmed the identification of such an individual. B.H. Status Hearing Transcript 16:11-\n22, November 9, 2017.  \n18 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:4401\nprogress. After several months, the Department has yet to provide Ms. White with that list. The \nDepartment has also refused to provide the Experts with proposals for program plans it is \nconsidering that are aimed at serving youth with high-end needs so the Experts could review things \nlike estimated costs, sources of funds, implementation timelines, and number of youth to be served. \nThe Department has said it does not plan to send those until it has decided which programs to \ncontract with. Again, the Experts are prevented from raising concerns before a decision is made. \nIn Plaintiffs’ view, the Experts are empowered under their appointment by the Court to information \nthey have requested and should be able to give meaningful comment before relevant decisions are \nfinalized. If the Department disagreed with the Experts’ recommendations about its proposed \ncourse of action, in Plaintiffs’ view, the Implementation Plan would require the parties and Experts \nto meet and confer before taking other steps for relief, if needed. Plaintiffs are deeply concerned \nthat we are meeting with a serious disagreement between the parties about the Plaintiffs’ role and \nthe Experts’ role in respect to the Implementation Plan and the Plaintiffs’ entitlements to be kept \ninformed of things more generally under the B.H. Decree. At the very least, communication is \nbroken.  \nIn light of the broken status of the process, Plaintiffs believe that Court intervention is \nrequired. The Department’s failure to provide information in a timely way has become a critical \nimpasse and the lack of speed in accepting or rejecting recommendations or coming up with an \nalternative approach is at a tipping point. Plaintiffs have made an initial proposal to the Department \nfor a process by which the Experts would be able to make more formal requests asking the \nDepartment to commit to responding within a two-week timeframe for certain requests. If the \nDepartment does not respond within that timeframe, the process would require the Department to \nreport to the Court the reason it could not meet the deadline. With regard to the Experts’ \n19 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:4402\nrecommendations, the process would require that if the Department receives a recommendation \nfrom the Experts under the Court order, the Department must either follow the recommendation \nor report to the Court within a specific timeframe the reason(s) it does not believe that course of \naction is necessary. The Experts would be in charge of when they make such requests and \nrecommendations, which would be reserved for appropriate situations. Plaintiffs and the Experts \nneed to know that when the Experts think something is critically important, there is a mechanism \nfor the Experts and the Court to get a prompt response or to be informed of why an answer is not \nforthcoming. \nWhile this process should not be necessary with an existing Court-ordered Implementation \nPlan, that Plan now requires amendment. Plaintiffs can no longer attempt cooperation while the \nDepartment continues its practice of delayed response (or no response at all), and the Experts are \nentitled to prompt receipt of information they request. Plaintiffs will ask the Department to confer \nregarding the above-referenced amendment to the Communication Plan, and Plaintiffs ask the \nCourt to direct that the Department participate in such negotiations.  \nAdditional Pending Motions Under B.H. \na.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce the Decree \nAt the last status hearing, the Court instructed the Parties to meet, confer, and negotiate to \nsee if they could come to an agreement on the issue of investigator caseloads. On February 26, \n2018, a meeting  on caseloads  was held  between Plaintiffs’ and DCFS counsel,  as well as \nindividuals from DCFS Operations Department and Office of Employee Services. At that meeting, \nthe Department presented and described new caseload reporting tools it intended to roll out to the \nfield. The Parties agreed to meet again when the next monthly caseload reports are produced to \ndiscuss the Department’s progress and the utility of the reporting tools to assist in managing \n20 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:4403\ncaseloads within the B.H. requirements. In the next meetings, Plaintiffs also expect to discuss \nwhether the Department is hiring and retaining enough workers, what is happening at the field \nlevel, and why assignments are routinely being made in violation of the B.H. Decree even when \nthere appears to be adequate workforce in a particular office. \nAt the February 26, 2018 meeting, Plaintiffs also notified the Department that immediate \nsupport for caseworkers is required in a number of sites across the state7 while the Department \nproceeds with its ongoing recruitment and hiring efforts. While Plaintiffs appreciate that some \nprogress is being made, the overloading of caseworkers in multiple sites across the state that have \nbeen over the caseload limits for months is not acceptable and puts the safety of youth at risk. As \nPlaintiffs told the Department, they will press for emergency relief with the Court if the extreme \nunderstaffing in these locations is not addressed in a timely manner. The Department has not \nprovided a response or update about whether or not it will address the extreme understaffing at the \nlocations Plaintiffs identified on February 26. Plaintiffs are hopeful that continued discussions with \nthe Department on this front at least will be productive and, accordingly suggest that this Motion \nremain pending for the time being. \nb.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel \nOn February 7, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their motion to compel the Department’s full response \nto Plaintiffs’ request for information relating to issues arising under the Decree and specifically \nrelating to intact family services provided by the Department. The Court directed the Department \nto respond to Plaintiffs’ motion on March 14, 2018. In the interim, the Department has not \n                                                 \n7 In particular, Plaintiffs pointed to Waukegan and Rockford, where caseworkers received up to \n21 and 33 cases, respectively, in the month of January. Plaintiffs also noted similar concerns in \nEmerald and Harvey, though those two locations do not rise to quite the same level as Waukegan \nand Rockford. \n21 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 612 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:4404\ninformed Plaintiffs of any intent to alter its position on the subject matter of Plaintiffs’ request and \nPlaintiffs plan to respond to the Department according to the briefing schedule. \nConclusion \nThe Department’s own failure to share critical information or work collaboratively with \nthe Experts and Plaintiffs has thwarted its progress under the Implementation Plan. Plaintiffs hope \nthat with negotiation and amendment to the Communication Plan, there will be a significant shift \nin the direction of the Department’s progress in developing the service array and supports for the \nmany youth in care with high-end needs. Plaintiffs stand ready to provide additional detail at the \nparties’ next appearance before the Court. \n \nDated: March 8, 2018       Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBy: /s/ Claire E.W.

During this \nreporting period, several of the projects began to generate proximal and distal outcomes and other \ndata,  which  are  both  contained  and  explained  in  each pilot’s  four-month  report.    The  data \nillustrates the progress that has been made and provides a guide to whether each of the pilots \nshould continue as originally drafted or whether certain pilots should be modified, revised, or \ndiscontinued.  This  process  is  accordance  with  the  experimentalist  approach  underlying  the \nImplementation Plan.   \nDCFS continues to make progress toward reform.  The data in the immersion sites is \nencouraging and DCFS, working with the Child Welfare Group, continues to develop master \ncoaches,  and  facilitators  who  are  trained  in  the  Child  and  Family  Team  Meeting  model.  \nDuring this reporting period, the parties discussed and agreed that the Core Practice Model \nwill be rolled out by individual agencies.  Dr. Allison Metz from NIRN has committed to \nassisting with this rollout process. DCFS plans to provide a proposed plan for that rollout to \nPlaintiffs and the Expert Panel in the near future.  \nFurther progress is demonstrated by other projects.  The Regenerations pilot, which \ntargets dually involved youth who are ready for release from the Juvenile Temporary Detention \nCenter in Cook County, continues to demonstrate improvements in placing youth in family and \nfamily-like settings and in the stability of these family and family-like placements.  TRPMI has \n                                                 \n1 This Fourth Triannual Report is neither a joint nor an agreed submission.  Due to the press of \ntime, there was insufficient opportunity for the Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel to review and \ncomment on this submission.  On information and belief, both the Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel \nhave filed separate submissions.      \n2 \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 4 of 57 PageID #:4063\n \nhired additional staff and has been diligently working on development of data systems with the \nhope to produce data in the next reporting period.  \nAs with any reform effort based on an experimentalist approach, some pilots will be \nsuccessful in achieving the desired outcomes and others will not.  For example, the Therapeutic \nFoster Care pilot has been slow to progress: two of the four TFC agencies have shown some \nsuccess, while the other two agencies have not demonstrated any measureable success.  DCFS \nhas begun discussions with the Expert Panel and plaintiffs’ counsel on next steps with respect \nto the TFC pilot.  The Care Management Entity pilot will be ending by June 2018 and DCFS \nwill be incorporating lessons learned from that pilot moving forward.  \nDetailed Status Report \nThe following provides the detailed report regarding the various initiatives that DCFS has \nundertaken pursuant to the Implementation Plan. \nI.  Application of Implementation Science to the Implementation Plan: \n \nUtilize principles of implementation science to develop, implement, evaluate and modify \ninitiatives outlined in the B.H. Implementation Plan. \n1.        Project Goals/Target: This Court’s Order of July 11, 2016 [Dkt. 527] provides \nfor DCFS’s retention of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN), to review and \ncomment on DCFS’s adherence to best practices in implementation science and assist with an \nassessment of DCFS’s implementation capacity and strategy. \n2.  Status  Report:    Mary  Nam,  DCFS  Associate  Director,  Strategy  and \nPerformance Execution, has conferred with Dr. Metz about the statewide rollout of the Core \nPractice Model.  Dr. Metz has committed to working with DCFS and the Expert Panel on \nimplementation of the rollout.  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 5 of 57 PageID #:4064\n \n3.  Revised Targets/Goals:   DCFS will work with Dr. Metz on the rollout of the \nCore Practice Model.   \nII.       Overarching Outcome Measures \n1.        Project Goals / Target:   The Implementation Plan requires DCFS to measure \nsafety, permanency and well-being of class members and to monitor changes in both the quality \nand quantity of services and supports to class members and their families.  The metrics DCFS \nwill use for measuring safety and permanency are the same measures used in the national Child \nand Family Service Reviews (CFSR), and the measures for well-being are based on a matrix \ndeveloped by the Child Welfare Advisory Sub-Committee.  Implementation Plan, pp. 4-7. \n  2.  Status Report:  Validation of Safety, Permanency and Stability Measures. \nDCFS continues to work with its vendor to finalize all dashboards with focus on the final \nvalidation of the CFSR dashboards that continued to be validated and are not recommended for \nuse.  The dashboards in yellow status means there is an issue which is the responsibility of the \nvendor to correct and then notify DCFS that a correction can be made so that the validation can \ncontinue.  DCFS is currently holding weekly calls with the vendor to address issues and improve \ncommunication.  The top priority is to address and complete all issues for the CFSR metrics. \nExhibit A, Four Month Status Report Mindshare Dashboards.   \n  Key Findings for Overarching Outcomes.   Key findings of data for some of the \noverarching outcomes measures are:2 \n  \n \n                                                 \n2 For this Triannual report, statewide CFSR measures by federal financial fiscal year (October to \nSeptember) were calculated by Chapin Hall due to concerns regarding the continued validation \nof the dashboards in the Mindshare platform.  DCFS anticipates that a more dynamic view of the \nCFSR measures will be available for the next triannual report.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 6 of 57 PageID #:4065\n \n             Permanency Achievement: \n•  Adoptions increased by 29% in immersion sites compared to an 11% increase \nstatewide from Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017 \n•  Guardianship increased by 69% in immersion sites as compared to a 28% \nincrease statewide from Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017  \n•  Reunifications increased by 9% in immersion sites as compared to a 5% \ndecrease statewide from Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017 \n \n            Maltreatment in Care per 100K Days:   \n \n•  There was a slight increase in the maltreatment in care rate statewide from \nCalendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017  \n \n            Permanency Achievement by CFSR Cohorts (12 months, 12-23 months and +24 \n  months \n•  Statewide, permanencies increase the longer children remain in foster care  \n \n            Placement Stability (rate of placement moves per 1000 days of care)3 \n•  Statewide, the rate of placement stability improved to 4.33 in federal Fiscal \nYear 2017 from a rate of 4.45 during federal Fiscal year 2017 \n \nExhibit B, Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites Key Findings as of \nFebruary 7, 2018.  \nIntegration of CANS DATA.  In the last Report, DCFS stated its intent to begin \ntracking as many well-being measures as possible.   At present, DCFS is in the process of \nconsolidating the CANS application, which will allow better tracking of CANS data on child \nwellbeing. \nDCFS  also  set  the  deadline  for  integrating  CANS  data  relative  to  the  well-being \nmeasures into the SACWIS system in the first quarter of FY18 (i.e., July through September \n2017).   DCFS is currently working with DCFS executive leadership to develop a plan to \nprioritize the work for integrating the CANS data. \n                                                 \n3 There are only three months of data for federal Fiscal year 2018 available for this measure, so \nconclusions cannot be drawn at this time. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 7 of 57 PageID #:4066\n \nIM CANS.   DCFS will proceed  with the implementation  of the  Illinois  Medicaid \nCANS.  \nPrioritization for Mindshare.   While the work with Mindshare continues, DCFS is \nalso in the process of reproducing all dashboards currently being hosted by Mindshare.  One of \nthe  requirements  under  the  current  contract  is  the  provision  of  a  data  dictionary  from \nMindshare. The data dictionary will assist DCFS in building the dashboards with new data \nvisualization software.  DCFS believes that the ability of DCSF to host the dashboards will \nbetter serve the agency.  It is anticipated that once DCFS is able to host the dashboards, the \namount of time to address and resolve issues will be reduced due to the data knowledge of IT \nstaff.   \nValidation of CANS Data.  The CWAC Subcommittee on Child Wellbeing continues \nto  make  significant  progress  on  its  analysis  for  CANS  data  and  data  collected  by  other \nindependent  measures.    Exhibit  C,  Four  Month  Status  Report  CWAC  Child  Wellbeing \n(January 30, 2018); Exhibit B, Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites \nKey Findings as of February 7, 2018.   \nAll new independent measures have been implemented by Integrated Assessment for \nFY18 for establishing a baseline of child wellbeing.  There have been 180 cases assessed using \nthe new measures; 58 of these cases are from the St. Clair immersion site, 44 are from the \nRock Island immersion site, 41 are from the Mt. Vernon immersion site and 37 are from the \nLake County immersion site.  Screeners are generally positive about using the direct web entry \ndatabase through Objective Arts.     Exhibit C, Four Month Status Report CWAC Child \nWellbeing (January 30, 2018). \nThe one outstanding data management issue during this reporting period  was that the \ntwo month old ASQ was not programmed into the initial system. However, the testing site is \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 8 of 57 PageID #:4067\n \nnow complete and final programming is anticipated to be completed during the next reporting \nperiod.  Backlog data entry is also anticipated to be completed during the next reporting period.  \nExhibit C, Four Month Status Report CWAC Child Wellbeing (January 30, 2018).  \nCANS data can be extracted from SACWIS. The Northwestern team had to format the \nextracted  data  into  a  format  that  was  comparable  to  the  larger  CANS  data  warehouse.     \nExhibit C, Four Month Status Report CWAC Child Wellbeing (January 30, 2018) \nThe evaluation team projects an initial report by the end of March 2018.   Exhibit C, \nFour Month Status Report CWAC Child Wellbeing (January 30, 2018) \nISBE   Data   Integration   into   SACWS:   Student records from ISBE are available \nin SACWIS.  The next step will be for DCFS to work to develop aggregate reports from the \nindividual records for use in data analysis and DCSF continues in its efforts to create a data \nwarehouse internally.  Exhibit B, Overarching Outcomes:  State, Regions and Immersion Sites \nKey Findings as of February 7, 2018. \nExpansion  of  Access to  the  Mindshare  Website  Within  DCFS.  Immersion  Site \nDirectors and project managers already have access to the Mindshare Website.  The expansion \nof the dashboards to DCFS staff and other private agency providers will be addressed once the \ndashboards are developed by and hosted by DCFS IT staff.  \nPrivate Provider Access to Mindshare.   The expansion of the dashboards to private \nagency providers will be addressed once the dashboards are developed by and hosted by DCFS \nIT staff.  \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nValidation of Safety, Permanency and Stability Measures. DCFS  continues  to \nwork with its outside vendor to complete validation of dashboards. In addition, \nDCFS is redeveloping the dashboards using different data visualization software.  \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 9 of 57 PageID #:4068\n \nDCFS’s current goal is to have a prototype of a dashboard completed toward the \nend of the next reporting period.  \nIntegration  of  CANS  Data.   The evaluation team project related to validation of \nCANS data anticipates an initial report to be completed during the next reporting period and \nmay be completed by the end of March 2018.  \nIM CANS.  The IM CANS may be implemented during the next reporting period.  \nPrioritization for Mindshare. DCFS continues to work with Mindshare in accordance \nwith the current contract, which is in place until January 2018.   DCFS continues to work on the \ndevelopment of dashboard developed by internal DCFS staff.  \nISBE Data Integration into SACWIS.  Student records from ISBE are available in \nSACWIS.  The next step will be for DCFS to build a data warehouse to allow for the creation \nof aggregate reports.   \n  Expansion of Access to Mindshare Website within DCFS.  This has been completed. \n \nPrivate  Provider  Access  to  Mindshare.    DCFS  will  reevaluate  this  issue  as \ndevelopment of dashboards by internal staff is completed.    \nIII.  Implementation of Specific Recommendations of the Expert Panel \nA.  Panel Recommendation #1: \nInstitute a children’s system of care demonstration program that permits POS agencies \nand DCFS sub-regions to waive selected policy and funding restrictions on a trial basis in order \nto reduce the use of residential treatment and help children and youth succeed in living in the \nleast restrictive, most family-like setting.  Implementation Plan, pp. 7-25.  \nThe Implementation Plan identifies four initiatives DCFS is pursuing in response to \nRecommendation # 1.  The first is the Therapeutic Foster Care pilot (TFC) initiative.  The second \nis the Case Management Entity pilot (CME).  The remaining two are programs targeted to the \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 10 of 57 PageID #:4069\n \nneeds of “dually involved youth” – the Regenerations pilot and Pay for Success.  Each of these \nprograms is discussed individually below. \nB.  Panel Recommendation #1: Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots \n \n1.        Project  Goals  /  Target:  The  Implementation  Plan  calls  for  DCFS  to  select \nprivate child welfare agencies to implement evidence-based or evidence-informed therapeutic \nfoster care programs over a five year period.  The goal of the TFC pilot is to determine whether \noutcomes for youth served in the TFC pilot programs are equal to or better than those for youth \nwho meet the clinical criteria for residential treatment and are placed in residential treatment. \nImplementation Plan, pp. 8-13.  At least 60% of the youth served in TFC licensed homes are \nto be age 12 and older.  Implementation Plan, pp. 8-9. \nDCFS set a two-year goal for the recruitment and licensure of therapeutic foster parents \nand placements.  The original goal included placement of a minimum of 40 children and youth \nin licensed  TFC  homes  at  the  end  of  the  “first  contractual  year”  (April  2018)  and \nplacement of a minimum of 100 children and youth at the end of the “second contractual year” \n(April 2019). \n2.  Status Report: \n \nRecruitment of foster families has been a priority in this reporting period.  DCFS, with \nthe assistance of the BH Experts, has worked with the agencies to identify activities to recruit \nnew licensed TFC foster parents. Recruitment activities have included working with current \nfoster parents, attending community events, attending events sponsored through health care \nproviders, attending PTO meetings in schools, and utilizing social media. Exhibit D, Four Month \nStatus Report Therapeutic Foster Care. \n  Additionally, efforts have been made to improve timely response to child referrals, as \nwell as to understand what activities support or delay the speed with which children are placed in \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 11 of 57 PageID #:4070\n \nTFC homes. DCFS is examining the process by which a youth is matched to a prospective \nplacement, the decision when a youth is accepted/ denied by a treatment provider, and when a \nyouth is actually placed.  \nDCFS, along with Chapin Hall, refined the uniform tracking sheet that each of the \nproviders submits on a bi-weekly basis. The tracking sheet, which initially contained fields for \nrecruitment and referrals, now has fields about the conclusion and outcome of cases.  \nThe TFC pilot has produced three sets of outputs which have generated data:  (1) TFC \ncapacity; (2) TFC fidelity to Family Focused Treatment Association Standards; and (3) TFC \nfidelity to specific intervention models.  Exhibit D, Four Month Status Report Therapeutic Foster \nCare, pp. 3-10.  The TFC pilot has also generated a progress report on attaining proximal and \ndistal outcomes.  Id. at 11-15. \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nTFC Placements.  The revised placement goals and timeline for the TFC pilot remains \nas stated in the Implementation Plan and prior reports to the Court is unchanged:  the goal and \ntimeframe for the TFC pilot is to have a minimum of 40 children and youth licensed TFC homes \nby April 1, 2018. There is a targeted goal to have a minimum of 100 youth placed by April 1, \n2019, with at least 60% of the youth serves in the age group of 12 and older. Since it is unlikely \nthat the interim goal of 40 TFC placements by March 31, 2018 will be met, that goal will need to \nbe the subject of discussion between DCFS, the Expert Panel and plaintiffs’ counsel.  DCFS has \ngenerally targeted goals for recruitment and placement for the agencies by March 31, 2018 are as \nfollows:  CH+A: TBD;  LSSI: 65 homes and 78 youth served.  \n  YOS and JCFS have been unable to develop TFC placements and place children in TFC \nhomes.  Each currently has one youth placed in a TFC home.  DCFS is reevaluating these \nprograms at the suggestion of the Expert Panel and plaintiffs’ counsel.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 12 of 57 PageID #:4071\n \n  LSSI and CH+A have had more encouraging results and  DCFS anticipates that the focus \nwill be on increasing placements with those agencies.   \n  In this reporting period, the TFC Evaluation/Implementation subcommittee recommended \nand the TFC Steering Committee agreed to create a discharge protocol.   Youth have both favor \nand unfavorable exits from the TFC program and DCFS is tracking these exits to better understand \nthe  clinical  dynamics  of  therapeutic  foster  care.    Youth  with  favorable  discharges  have \nsuccessfully completed the TFC program.  Youth with unfavorable discharges are those require a \nnew placement, a psychiatric hospitalization or a higher level of care.  There are times when youth \nmay be re- referred to the program and DCFS will be capturing this information as well. The \nfollowing information will be documented on the tracking sheets:   \n1.  Each episode of TFC care will be tracked on a unique row of data. For example, if a youth \nhas 3 episodes of care, there will be 3 rows of data. \n \n2.  The first episode of TFC care should contain the following comprehensive information: \n•  Date of referral \n•  Date of response to referral \n•  Date of child interview with agency \n•  Date of child visit \n•  Date Team Leader talks with case manager \n•  Date program accepted youth  \n•  Date foster parent accepted youth \n•  Date of referral disposition \n•  Disposition outcome \n•  Date of placement \n \n3.  Subsequent episodes of care, due to discharge from the first episode of care, should \ncontain, at minimum, date of referral and date of placement, in addition to other dates \nfrom the above list that are relevant to these follow-up episodes of care. \n \nThe  primary  implementation  barrier  in  this  reporting  period  was  the  inconsistent \ntimeframe from referral to placement.  DCFS took two steps to better understand this barrier and \nto devise a strategy to address the issue. First, case record reviews were conducted with YOS, \nJCFS and LSSI.  Each provider reported on two cases: one which went smoothly and expediently \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 13 of 57 PageID #:4072\n \nand  one  which  encountered  barriers.    Discussions  regarding  the  cases  highlighted  issues \nproviders encounter, including the need to balance speed of decision making with the best \ninterest of the youth (e.g., delaying placement to allow a youth to finish a school term), the \nimportance of conducting a thoughtful review of a case before accepting a referral to ensure an \nappropriate match is made, and the benefit of identifying a discharge resource at the outset of a \ncase, among others.  Second, efforts are underway to determine the typical timeframe from \nreferral to placement for other levels of care within DCFS to better understand how the TFC \ntimeline compares. Together, this information will help inform both provider-level and system-\nlevel efforts to improve the timeliness and appropriateness of TFC placements.  \nFinally, efforts continue to ensure that residential staff understand the TFC models and \ncan collaborate with TFC providers to best serve youth in care.  \nThe TFC pilot manager will also work with DCFS Agency Performance Monitoring to \nensure that compliance and quality of services are being provided and monitored.  DCFS is also \nin the process of assigning a clinical coordinator assigned to the TFC team who can be available \nfor additional support.   \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \n  DCFS,  in  consultation  with  the  BH  Experts  and  Plaintiffs’  counsel,  will  continue \ndiscussions to revise the TFC placement goals for this pilot and will explore other options for the \ndevelopment of TFC homes.  \n  C.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Care Management Entity \n1.  Project Goals / Target: \n \nThe planned goals for the Care Management Entity (CME) pilot include:  increasing \nnontraditional, community-based behavioral health supports; faster step-downs for  youth in \ncongregate  care  settings  (i.e.,  15%  of  enrolled  youth  to  step  down  six  months  after \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 14 of 57 PageID #:4073\n \nenrollment and another 15% to step down 12 months after enrollment); treating youth and \nfamily  voice  and  choice  as  primary  factors  in  permanency  planning  and  mental \nhealth/behavioral health interventions; reduction in youth experiencing elevations in level of \ncare (i.e., youth being placed in specialized foster care or congregate care settings); increased \nplacement  stability  at  the  traditional  foster  care  level  (i.e.,  fewer  lateral  moves);  high \nservice-intensity  youth  receiving necessary  behavioral  health  supports  and  services  in  \ntheir  home  and  community  settings; decreased psychiatric hospitalization; and increased \npermanency. \nThe  CME  pilot,  which is  administered  though  CHOICES,  began  in  February  2014 \nand was scheduled to continue through June 30, 2017; the pilot was extended until June 30, \n2018.  The goal of the pilot was to serve 200 youth annually and 600 youth during the course of \nthe pilot.   DCFS committed to identifying a comparison group for the evaluation by December \n2016 and to completing an interim evaluation by March 2017.  Implementation Plan, p. 19. \n  2.  Status Report: \n \nExtension of the Pilot in FY18:  The current plan provides for the conclusion of the \nCHOICES pilot by June 30, 2018 since youth in care will be covered by a managed care \nprogram through the Department of Healthcare and Family Services and Illini Care.  \nThe  current  efforts  related  to  the  CME  pilot  revolve  around  the  end  of  the  pilot, \nincluding identifying an end date for referrals and the transition and continuity of services for \nyouth currently being served in the pilot.  There are ongoing discussions regarding a date on \nwhich to end referrals to the pilot.  Since the pilot follows a high fidelity wraparound model, it \nrequires significant time on the front end to identify youth and family strengths, needs and \nnatural  supports  that  are  necessary  to  develop  an  individualized  comprehensive  plan.  \nConsideration must be given to this time requirement in determining the end date for referrals.  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 15 of 57 PageID #:4074\n \nAdditionally, DCFS is in the process of reviewing CHOICES provided services to identify what \nservices are needed when the pilot ends to ensure continuity of service provision for youth in the \npilot. \nDCFS led programs, such as Intensive Placement Stabilization Services, System of Care \nservices and the Clinical Intervention for Placement Preservation were removed from the pilot \narea when it began.  DCFS must develop a process for reinstating these programs to the service \nareas covered by the pilot. \nChildren  Served.  During this reporting period, the CME served 188 youth in care, \nincluding 22 youth that were enrolled during September to December 2017 and 14 youth that \nwere discharged during September to December 2017.  To date, the CME pilot has served 409 \nyouth in care.  DCFS met its goal of maintaining a census of approximately 160 youth in the \nCME pilot during FY 2018.  Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, Case Management Entity \nPilot December 2017; Exhibit F, CME DCFS Triannual Data September to December 2017. \nIn addition, during this reporting period, nine  youth  assigned to the  pilot achieved \npermanency. Five of the nine youth reunified with family and four youth were adopted; there \nwere no youth who achieved permanency through guardianship.  From the commencement of \nthe pilot through December 2017, 88 youth assigned to the pilot achieved permanency and those \npermanencies were almost evenly split between reunifications (45) and adoptions (42).   Exhibit \nF, CME DCFS Triannual Data September to December 2017.   \nYouth and families who participated in Child and Family Team meetings (CFTM) as \npart of the CME pilot continued to approve of the CFTM process.   During this reporting period. \n89% of the youth and families were satisfied or very satisfied that their voices were being heard \nduring the CFTM process. Exhibit F, CME DCFS Triannual Data September to December 2017.   \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 16 of 57 PageID #:4075\n \nAddressing  Program  Barriers.   DCFS continued to meet with the CME and POS \nadministration.    The  CME  made  efforts  to  increase  integration  in  the  community  by \nparticipating in local LANS meetings and the Champaign Community Coalition, a group of \nlocal community leaders and local police chiefs, and by hosting quarterly Network Advisory \nCommittees.  These activities are good faith efforts to integrate community resources and \ndemonstrated continued movement towards this goal.  Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, \nCase Management Entity Pilot December 2017. \nThe  Program  Supervisor  and  Deborah  Keen,  DCFS  Behavioral  Health  Specialist \ncompleted a review of the CFTMs for youth placed in residential treatment that were held as \npart of the CME pilot.  This review resulted in a recommendation that permanency supervisors \nperiodically request a clinical review and insight into cases that appear to be “stagnant.”   The \npurpose of this review would be to assist permanency staff in viewing the case from a different \nperspective and engage different strategies to assist moving in youth moving from congregate \ncare settings.  The review also recognized that youth enrolled in the CME pilot faced the same \nchallenges  as  other  youth  around  the  statement  in  identifying  step  down  resources  and \nplacements.   Exhibit E, Four Month Status Report, Case Management Entity Pilot December \n2017. \n  Foster Parent Recruitment and Improved Communication.     Due to the focus on \nissues related to determining the end date for referrals, CHOICES did not meet with any foster \nparent groups during this reporting period.  \nCourt Outreach.  Court outreach efforts were postponed while DCFS and the CME \nfocus on issues related to the end of the pilot.  During this reporting period, there have not been \nany court related issues for youth involved in the pilot.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 17 of 57 PageID #:4076\n \nEnhancement  to  the  Mobile  Crisis  Response  Process:   The  service  of  a  mobile \ncrisis response team to assess youth undergoing a behavioral health crisis has been offered \nthrough the CME Pilot since April 2016. During this reporting period, the data continues to \ndemonstrate a  reduction in the rate of hospitalization for children who received mobile crisis \nresponse services.  There were 188 youth enrolled during in the pilot between September \nand  December  2017  and  14%  (26)  of  those  youth  received  mobile  crisis  response \nservices.  Of those youth who received mobile crisis response services, 62% did not \nhave  any  follow  up  screenings.    Exhibit  F,  CME  DCFS  Triannual  Data  September  to \nDecember 2017.   \nPilot Evaluation.  Work continues on data sharing with the researcher assigned to the \npilot  and  DCFS  awaits  his  analysis  and  the  evaluation.  The  evaluation  will  answer  the \nquestion whether youth in care with behavioral health issues who are placed in congregate \ncare  settings  and  foster  care  with  placement  stability  issues  experience  higher  rates  of \npermanency achievement, shorter lengths of stay in congregate care settings and increased \nplacement stability if they are provided intensive care coordination for behavioral health \nissues.   \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nExtension of the Pilot.  Discussions centered on determining the end date for referrals \nto the pilot and identifying services for youth that would need to continue once the pilot has \nended.   Those dates and the plan for service continuity will be shared during the next reporting \nperiod.  \nChildren Served. The goal for FY 2018 is for Choices to maintain a monthly census \nof 160 children and at goal remains the same. \n \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 18 of 57 PageID #:4077\n \nCourt Outreach. Outreach with court personnel was postponed to focus on issues related \nto the end of the pilot and the transition to managed care.  \nPilot Evaluation.  Mark Arber is the identified researcher from the University of \nIllinois, Urbana-Champaign and he has been provided with guidelines for the comparative \nresearch as well as access to the child care information.  DCFS continues to compile data on \nyouth in comparison counties.   \n  D.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved  \n    Youth at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe Regenerations pilot is designed to provide placements and intensive services to \nDCFS youth in care, 12 to 18 years old, who are also involved in the juvenile justice system and \nare ready for release from the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).  Implementation \nPlan, pp. 20-22.  The program provides traditional mental health services, care coordination, \nfoster care services (if needed) and individualized home and community based services through a \nwraparound philosophy.  Id. The Regenerations pilot is a collaborative effort with the JTDC, \nCook County Juvenile Probation, Lutheran Child and Family Services (LCFS), Youth Advocate \nPrograms (YAP), and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  The program goal was to \nserve 65 youth.  There was no deadline specified in the Implementation Plan for reaching that \nlevel of service, however the pilot was scheduled to be completed in June 2017.  Implementation \nPlan, p. 21.      \n2.  Status Report:    \nProgram  Conversion/Refinement.    The  Regenerations  pilot  will  continue  through \nFY18.  The current program provides that LCFS assumes case management responsibility for a \nyouth new to care when they are placed on the RUR list at the Cook County JTDC or released \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 19 of 57 PageID #:4078\n \nfrom JTDC directly to shelter care. For youth already in care, LCFS assumes case management \nresponsibility when a youth is placed on the RUR list or released directly to shelter care, the \nyouth  does  not  have  a  placement  option  and  transferring  case  management  is  not  contra-\nindicated.  LCFS case managers are required to have at least three in person visits with each \nyouth every month.  Exhibit G, Four Month Status Report, Regenerations Pilot Project for \nDually Involved Youth at Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.   \nThe Youth Advocate Program (YAP) provides in-home supports to both the youth and \nthe caregiver.  Youth advocates are typically individuals from the communities in which the \nyouth reside and are available at all times to the youth and to the caregiver. Youth advocates \nfocus on intentional skills building for the youth, family repairing activities, and attendance at   \ncourt hearings, CIPPS and CFTMs.  Clients are targeted to receive an average of 15 advocate \nhours per week once the case is assigned.  The advocate hours can be adjusted and increased if, \nfor example, a youth is experiencing difficulty adjusting to a less restrictive setting, exhibiting \nrisky  behavior  or  experiencing  high  stress  levels.    Exhibit  G,  Four  Month  Status  Report, \nRegenerations Pilot Project for Dually Involved Youth at Cook County Juvenile Temporary \nDetention Center.   \nThe Regenerations Implementation Team consists of three DCFS staff, including the \nAssociate Deputy Director for the Office of Delinquency Prevention and Restorative Justice; the \nDually Involved Program Manager and the Statewide CIPP Program Manager; two LCFS staff, \nincluding  the  Program  Manager  and  Northern  Illinois  Regional  Director;  three  YAP  staff, \nincluding the regional and program directors and three staff from Chapin Hall, the principal \nevaluator.   The Implementation Team meets on a monthly basis and all monthly meetings were \nheld during this reporting period.  Exhibit G, Four Month Status Report, Regenerations Pilot \nProject for Dually Involved Youth at Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.   \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 20 of 57 PageID #:4079\n \n  Foster Parent Recruitment.  During this reporting period, LCFS had to re-schedule \nsome foster parent recruitment events due to a lack of responses.  LCFS continues to explore \noptions for recruiting foster parents.   \nWraparound Consultants.  LCFS and YAP are working together to schedule ongoing \nwraparound training for direct service staff involved with Regenerations pilot. Monthly trainings \nhave been ongoing and the next training is scheduled for March 20, 2018.  \nOutput Data Analysis.   DCFS has data for each of the 13 Program Output metrics for \n64 youth who were served in the pilot during FY18.  Some highlights of the Program Output \nmetrics include: \nProgram Output 5 -  Individual Service Plans to include In-home Supports, Access to educational \nand  recreational  activities,  crisis  coordination  and  intervention  and  placement  stabilization \nservices:  \n•  94%  (60  out  of  64  youth)  of  youth  had  an  individual  service  plan  (ISP)  in \nSACWIS.  With respect to those ISPs, 75% (48 out of 60 youth) of the ISPs had \nin-home supports indicated in the Outcome/Action steps, 83% (53 of 60 youth) \nhad educational and recreational activities indicated in the Outcome/Action steps, \n86.7% (52 of 60 youth) had coordination of crises intervention services indicated \nin the Outcome/Action steps and 76.5% (49 of 60 youth) had placement  \nstabilization services indicated in the Outcome/Action steps  \n \nProgram Output 6 – Quarterly Child and Family Team Meetings and composition at CFTM: \n•  84.3% (54 of 64 youth) had at least one CFTM recorded in SACWIS   \nfrom July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018 \n•  44.4% (24 of 54 youth) had a CFTM each quarter they were enrolled in the pilot \n•  35.1% (19 of 54 youth) had all key stakeholders present in their first CFTM in \nFY18  \n \nProgram Output 7 – Frequency of CASII following home based placement:  \n•  79.7% (51 of 64 youth) had a post-placement CASII on file  \n \nProgram Output 13 – Provision of Flex Funds when Appropriate: \n•    Flex funds were used for 64  youth and a total of $52,418.65 in flex funds \n   were expended between September 2017 and December 2017  \n \nOutcome Data and Analysis.    \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 21 of 57 PageID #:4080\n \n  During this reporting period, DCFS, with the assistance of Chapin Hall, was able to use \ndata from the Cook County Juvenile Court to construct a matched historical comparison group \nfrom FY14-FY15. The comparison group was matched to the 64 youth in the pilot that received \nservices in FY18 by age, gender and ethnicity.  Using this historical comparison group, DCFS \nhas data on proximal, intermediate and distal outcomes.  Some highlights of that data include:  \nProximal Outcome 1 -  Fewer Days in JTDC after mandatory release date:  \n  \n•  The pilot group on average had a shorter wait time than the comparison group \nfrom RUR date to JTDC release date  \n•  The average number of days between RUR date and JTDC release date for the \npilot group was 45.2 days and the median number of days between RUR date \nand JTDC date was 30,5 days while the after number of days between RUR date \nand JTDC release date for the comparison group was 104.5 days and the mediate \nnumber of days between RUR release date and JTDC date was 37 days \n \nIntermediate Outcome 1 – More Discharges to and Days in Family or Family-Like Settings and \nDays in Family or Family-Like Settings  \n   \n•  The pilot group on average had a higher percentage of youth released from JTDC \nto family or family like settings than the comparison group  \n•  76.6% of the youth in the pilot were released to family or family-like settings  \n•  18.8% of the youth in the comparison group were released to family or family-\nlike settings  \n \n•  The average number of days that the pilot group (49 of 64 youth) remained in the \nfamily or family-like setting was 120.3 days and the mediate number of days that \nthe pilot group remained in the family or family-like setting was 55 days \n•  The average number of days that the comparison group (12 of 64 youth) remained \nin the family or family-like settings was 276.3 days and the median number of \ndays that the comparison group remained in the family or family-like settings was \n181 days  \n \nIntermediate Outcome 2 – From JTDC, fewer discharges to and days in residential care  \n \n•  The  pilot  group  on  average  had  fewer  youth  discharged  from  JTDC  to  a \nresidential treatment facility than the comparison group  \n•  18.8% of the youth (12 of 64 youth) in the pilot were discharged JTDC to a \nresidential treatment facility   \n•  35.9% of the youth (23 of 64youth) in the comparison group were discharged \nfrom JTDC to a residential treatment facility  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 22 of 57 PageID #:4081\n \n•  The pilot group that were released from JTDC to a residential treatment facility \nhad fewer days of care in a residential treatment facility than the comparison \ngroup  \n•  The average number of days that youth in the pilot group stayed in residential \ncare was 205.8 days and the median number of days that youth in the pilot group \nstayed in residential care was 178 days  \n•  The  average  number  of  days  that  youth  in  the  comparison  group  stayed  in \nresidential care was 344.04 days and the median length of stay was 199 days  \n \nExhibit G, Four Month Status Report, Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually Involved Youth at \nCook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.   \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \n   Dashboard.    The  date  for  completion  of  the  Regenerations  dashboard  is  not  yet \ndetermined, however Chapin Hall is providing data that is used for the outputs and outcome \nmetrics.  \nFinal Report.  Chapin Hall will prepare a final Regenerations report at the conclusion of \nFY 2018, the final year of the pilot.   \nE.  Panel  Recommendation  #1:    Illinois  Pay  for  Success  Pilot  for  Dually-\nInvolved   Youth \n  1. Progress Goals / Target:   \n  The Illinois Pay for Success Pilot, directed to youth dually involved in the child welfare \nand juvenile justice systems, was designed to reduce recidivism and increase placement stability, \neducational achievements and employment opportunities, by funding the pilot through a social \nimpact bond, by which private funds are used to pay for the pilot services.  Implementation Plan, \npp. 22-25.   The goal was to serve 800 youth in the treatment group and 800 youth in the control \ngroup over four years.   \nConscience Community Network (“CCN”) was not able to secure the private funding that \nit was required to secure under the terms of its contract with DCFS.  That contract with CCN will \nterminate effective January 31, 2018, and DCFS and CCN executed a contract extension to wind \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 23 of 57 PageID #:4082\n \ndown treatment  and services for the remaining 19 youth in the pilot.   Exhibit H, Illinois Pay for \nSuccess Pilot for Dually-Involved Youth, Four Month Status Report, Sept. – Dec. 2017, dated \n1/19/2018.     \n  2.  Status Report:     \nFunding.  CCN could not meet the required fundraising goal, despite DCFS’s agreement \nto extend the time allowed for fundraising and to decrease the target fundraising goal.  Exhibit H, \nIllinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved Youth, Four Month Status Report, Sept. – Dec. \n2017, dated 1/19/2018.     \n  Youth Served.  CCN’s intake was on hold for most this reporting period given CCN’s \ninability  to  meet  the  fundraising  goal  and  consequently  the  number  of  youth  in  the  pilot \ndecreased.  There are currently 19 youth being served in the pilot.  The Operations Committee is \ncurrently reviewing each youth to determine who will be expected to complete treatment by \nMarch 15, 2018, and who will need continued services under a new contract. \n  Evaluation.  The evaluation design originally called for an evaluation three years after \ntreatment. The University of Michigan evaluated the ramp up youth at one year after treatment to \nascertain whether there were any trends.   A summary of those findings is below and the \nevaluation is attached along with a description of their interventions.  As part of the original \npilot, the University of Michigan did an evaluation of the 53 youth in the ramp up phase to \ncompare  to  the  control  group.    Exhibit  I,  Appendix  A,  University  of  Michigan,  Updated \nSummary of PFS Pilot Data.  \n•  21% decrease in congregate care days for youth in treatment group compared to \ncontrol group;  \n•  58% decrease in detention days for youth in treatment group compared to control \ngroup; \n•  The overall risk of having even one day in congregate care decreased by 22% for the \ntreatment group; \n \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 24 of 57 PageID #:4083\n \n•  The overall risk of having even one day in detention decreased by 17% for the \ntreatment group;  \n \n  3.  Revised Targets / Goals:   \n  Due to CCN’s inability to raise funds, CCN’s intake has been on hold since October 1, \n2017.  DCFS has permitted services to existing youth to continue until a new contract can be \nexecuted. A new contract is being negotiated:  the contract will be a performance based contract \nbetween CCN and DCFS with no private funding and control group. Success metrics are being \nrevised and negotiated. DCFS hopes to include as many of the existing innovative approaches as \npossible in the contract including:  wraparound services,  flex funding, and evidence based \ntherapies.  Exhibit I, Appendix B, Summary of CCN Interventions.  DCFS will also attempt to \ninclude in the new contract on-going use and access to the previously developed database to help \nidentify dually involved youth statewide. The University of Michigan will no longer evaluate the \nnew contract; performance measures will be evaluated within DCFS.   \n  DCFS anticipates that it will know by mid-March 2018 if there will be a new contract \nwith CCN.  DCFS’s intention is for CCN to service youth in Cook and Lake counties and to \nreceive referrals directly through the DCFS Dually Involved Division. \n  F.  Panel Recommendation #2 \nCreate  four  “immersion  sites”  of  small  geographic  areas  that  coincide  with  judicial \ncircuits to fully build, test and implement a core practice model that puts children and families at \nthe center of service planning and builds community and home-based services for children and \ntheir families.

(Implementation Plan at pp. 25-38). \n4.  Project Goals / Target: \n \nImmersion Sites are test or pilot sites representing a small geographic area where youth, \nbirth parents, foster parents, DCFS staff, private agency staff and multiple other stakeholders \nwork together to fully build and implement a “core practice model” of child welfare practice \nthatputs children and families at the center of service planning and builds community and \nhome based resources to service children and families.  DCFS intends to use Immersion Sites \nas the center of its transformation to improve safety, permanency and stability outcomes. \nDCFS continues to track data on a statewide, regional and Immersion Site basis for the \nfollowing outcomes:   maltreatment in foster care, repeat maltreatment, child and family team \nmeetings, supervised and unsupervised visits, family reunification within five and 12 months, \npermanency within 12 months, total permanency achievements by month and year to date, \npermanency within 12 months, total permanency achievements by month and year to date, \nplacement moves, time to achieve family reunification and intact service levels.

DCFS continues to review data for the state  \nand the immersion sites on key indicators regarding permanency, maltreatment and stability.  \nSome of the key findings from the data demonstrate:  \nPermanency Achievement: \n•  Adoptions increased by 29% in immersion sites compared to an 11% increase statewide \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 26 of 57 PageID #:4085\n \nfrom Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017 \n•  Guardianship increased by 69% in immersion sites as compared to a 28% increase \nstatewide from Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017  \n•  Reunifications increased by 9% in immersion sites as compared to a 5% decrease \nstatewide from Calendar Year 2016 to Calendar Year 2017 \n \nMaltreatment in Care per 100K Days:4 \n•  There was a slight increase in the maltreatment in care rate statewide from Federal Fiscal \nYear 2016 to Federal Fiscal Year 2017  \n \nPermanency Achievement by CFSR Cohorts (12 months, 12-23 months and +24 months) \n•  Statewide, permanencies increase the longer children remain in foster care  \n \nRoll-Out to New Immersion Sites.   The parties continue discussions regarding a \nrevised plan for rollout of key components of immersion sites.  During this reporting period, \nthe parties discussed and agreed to rollout the Core Practice Model by agencies and a plan for \nthat rollout is currently in development.  \nFTS Training and Implementation.   All staff in the immersion sites received FTS \ntraining.  \n  Since March 2017, the DCFS Field Implementation Support Program (FISP) has offered \nmonthly  training  on  FTS  practice.    These  trainings  rotate  between  immersion  sites  to \naccommodate staff who have been hired or transferred into the immersion site after the initial \nround of FTS training.  FISP staff works collaboratively with Immersion Site Directors to \nidentify staff that require this training.  \n  Additionally, the self-directed learning module for FTS training is currently available on \nthe  DCFS  Virtual  Training  Center.    As  of  November  30,  2017,  the  following  staff  have \ncompleted the FTS self-directed training: \n  36 residential staff;  \n                                                 \n4 For this Triannual report, statewide CFSR measures by federal financial fiscal year (October to \nSeptember) were calculated by Chapin Hall due to concerns regarding the continued validation \nof the dashboards in the Mindshare platform.  DCFS anticipates that a more dynamic view of the \nCFSR measures will be available for the next triannual report.  \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 27 of 57 PageID #:4086\n \n  57 out of 58 scheduled non-residential staff (96.55%); \n  85 out of 100 scheduled State Central Register staff (85%); \n  312 community partners  \nExhibit  K,  Four  Month  Status  Report,  Core  Practice  Model  (November  2017  update)  and \nExhibit L,  Four Month Status Report, Core Practice Model (October to December 2017). \nProcedure  315  Training.    As  of  March  30,  2017,  100%  of  permanency  and \nadoption staff, including supervisors and managers in the immersion sites have completed \ntraining in revised Procedure 315.  Makeup sessions are being offered for this training as \nwell, on a rotating basis between Immersion Sites, to account for newly hired staff and staff \nwho need make-up sessions. \n  MoSP Training. DCFS currently anticipates that MoSP training will begin in March \n2018.  As currently designed, the training will include a combination of classroom training and  \nindividual  coaching and will be targeted to occur within the current immersion sites following \nthe completion of the initial four Child and Family Team coaching cycles.  Exhibit K, Four \nMonth Status Report, Core Practice Model (November 2017 update); and Exhibit L, Four Month \nStatus Report, Core Practice Model (October - December 2017). \n              CFTM Training.   DCFS and the Child Welfare Group (CWG) continue to work on \ndevelopment of the Master Coaches.  In October 2017, CWG advised that identified master \ncoach candidates would receive CWG confirmation as coaches and master coaches concurrently \nat the close of cycle four.  On November 3, 2017, one FISP staff was confirmed by CWG as a \nmaster coach a full cycle early.  Eleven more staff, including nine FISP staff and two CIPP staff, \nare on track for achieving master coach confirmation by the end of cycle four.  There is an \nadditional FISP staff that missed cycles two and three due to an unexpected leave of absence, \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 28 of 57 PageID #:4087\n \nhowever that staff member returned in November and was able to pick up where she left off by \njoining the fourth cycle to begin working on development as a coach. \nDCFS currently 18 master coaches completed by December 2017.  These staff include:  \nten FISP staff, two CIPP staff, one TRPMI staff and five POS staff.  An additional TRPMI staff \nis in the process of becoming a master coach.  DCFS anticipates that the FISP staff and TRPMI \nstaff can achieve master coach status in 2018.  \nThe third round of CFTM classroom trainings was completed in November 2017 in each \nimmersion site.  Ten FISP staff have been approved by CWG as trainers of CFTM curriculum \ngoing forward.  There are several FISP staff awaiting CWP approval to develop other trainers of \nthis curriculum.   \nThe following chart details the number of participants trained in the three day classroom \nbased CFTM training; coached as facilitators, coaches and master coaches; and trained as the \ntrainers for the  three day class:   \nTotal All Immersion Sites \nCurrently in \n   Trained to Date \nTraining  \nCFTM - 3 Day Training  148    \nSupervisors  36    \nCaseworkers  111    \nOther  0    \nFacilitators Trained  55  29 \nCoaches Trained  12  9 \nMaster Coaches Trained  18  1 \nTraining of Trainers \n1st Observation  12  12 \n1st Delivery  11  11 \nTrainer Approval  10  1 \n  \n \nExhibit L, Four Month Status Report, Core Practice Model (October to December 2017). \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 29 of 57 PageID #:4088\n \n  QSR  Training  and  Implementation.      During  September,  the  DCFS  QSR \nreviewers paired up to complete a total of four QSR reviews in each immersion site \nand  attended  two  QSR  Team  Meetings  via  teleconference.    During  October,  a  new \ndedicated QSR reviewer was hired and was trained along with two additional non-\ndedicated QSR reviewers.  There was a fourth on-site review with CWG mentors \nduring the week of October 16 to 19, 2017.  QSR staff also participated in a case \nswap  and  attended  team  meetings  via  teleconference.  Additionally,  QSR reviewers \npaired up and completed an additional two paired reviews in the Rock Island Immersion site. \n  During November and December, QSR reviewers paired up on their own and conducted a \nseries of reviews in East St Louis, Rock Island, Mt. Vernon and Waukegan.   During December \nthe QSR reviewers also completed a case swap of completed cases and attending several team \nmeetings. \nIn addition, during this reporting period, QSR reviewers regularly met with immersion \nsite  directors  and  attended  CQI  ted  activities.

Exhibit M, \nFour Month Status Report, QSR. \nService Provision.     Contracts for lead agencies in each of the  Immersion Sites \ncontinue to be in place.  The lead agencies are:  Spero Family Services in the Mount Vernon \nImmersion Site, Lessie Bates Davis in the East St. Louis Immersion Site, Bethany in the Rock \nIsland Immersion Site and NiCASA in the Lake County Immersion Site.  \nIV-E Waiver.  The Administration for Children and Families asked DCFS to provide a \ndetailed plan for implementation of the IV-E waiver by April 2017 and this was completed.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel and the Expert Panel have been provided copies of all submissions to the \nAdministration for Children and Families \nOffice Realignment.  DCFS developed a plan to align regional and field offices with \njudicial circuits, however DCFS will not be going forward with this plan.  \nRestructuring and Decentralization.   DCFS continues to work on structural issues \nto better align with practice goals and expectations in the Immersion Sites. \n6.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \nRoll-Out to New Sites.   DCFS continues to discuss revisions to the immersion site \nprocess with plaintiffs’ counsel and the Expert Panel.  The parties have reached agreement to \nroll out the Core Practice Model by agency and DCFS is currently developing a plan for this \nrollout.  \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 32 of 57 PageID #:4091\n \nFTS Training and Implementation.    This has been completed in the four initial \nImmersion Sites and monthly training sessions are being held to train staff new to immersion \nsites.  \nProcedure  315  Training.    All  staff  in  the  Immersion  Sites  have  completed  this \nrequired training. \nMoSP.  The MoSP training is projected to begin in March 2018.  \n \nChild and Family Team Training.   DCFS continues to work with CWG to \ntrain Master Coaches and coaches.   \nQuality Service Review Process.  The four dedicated QSR reviewers have engaged in \nnumerous activities during this reporting period.  During the next reporting period, the fifth \nround of coaches will be held.  \nProgram Evaluation.  Details of the outputs and proximal and distal outcomes are \nstated in considerable detail in the status report on Immersion Sites.   \nG.  Panel Recommendation #3: \nFund a set of permanency planning initiatives to improve permanency outcomes for \nadolescents who enter state custody at age 12 or older either by transitioning youth to permanent \nhomes  or  preparing  them  for  reconnection  to  their  birth  families  reaching  adulthood. \n(Implementation Plan, pp. 38-42). \nStatus Report:  DCFS has addressed this recommendation by expanding eligibility for \nstate funded guardianship, expanding the definition of fictive kin and engaging permanency \nworkers in family finding practices during all phases of casework.  DCFS has updated its rules \nand  procedures  with  respect  to  state  funded  guardianship,  fictive  kin  and  family  finding \nactivities.    With  respect  to  practice  changes,  DCFS  implemented  a  process  through  the \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 33 of 57 PageID #:4092\n \nAdministrative Case Review Process to review questions specifically related to state funded \nguardianship, fictive kin and family finding activities.   \n  G.  Panel Recommendation # 3: Amended Definition of “Fictive Kin” \n \n  1.  Project Goals/Target \n \nThe  Implementation  Plan  contemplates  that  amendments  to  expand  the  definition \nof  fictive  kin  will  improve  permanency  options  and  lead  to  improved  well-being.  DCFS \ncommitted to  updating  its  administrative  rules  with  the  expanded  definition  of  fictive  kin \nafter January 1, 2017, which was the effective date of the statutory change to the Children \nand Family Services Act.  Implementation Plan, pp. 39-40. \n2.  Status Report: \n \nDCFS is in the final process of completing the rulemaking process with the  \n \nupdated definition of fictive kin with respect to DCFS Rules 300, 301, 302, 304, 309, 315, \n \n328,  337,  338,  359  and  402.   It is anticipated that these rules will be finalized in February \n2018.  Exhibit N, Four Month Status Report Amended Expanded State Funded Guardianships, \nAmended Definition of “Fictive Kin: and Family Finding (SG-HFK-FF) Projects February 2018.   \nThere are currently 7,010 youth in care placed in fictive kin homes.  With respect to \nyouth who entered care in FY18, 1,423 of those youth have been placed in fictive kin homes. \nWhile there is no data regarding whether family finding activities are occurring during child \nabuse and neglect investigations, the large number of youth placed with relatives and fictive kin \nclearly demonstrates strides in DCFS practice in terms of locating and placing  youth with \nrelatives or with individuals with whom they have a connection.

DCFS will continue tracking placements and outcomes of youth in \nfictive kin homes to monitor for safety, stability and permanency.  The mechanism for tracking \nyouth  in  fictive  kin  placement  was  originally  identified  as  a  dashboard  in  the \nMindshare platform.   Efforts to complete this dashboard were delayed in light of the need to \ncomplete the dashboards for the CFSR measures. However, DCFS program and IT staff have \nworked to obtain some preliminary data in the Mindshare data in the interim.  DCFS has \npreliminary and unvalidated data regarding:  the number of children who are placed in fictive kin \nhomes, who have been in care three to five years, the number of youth entering care in FY17 and \nFY18 with family findings activities and the number of permanencies by type in FY8.  See \nExhibit  N,  Four  Month  Status  Report  Amended  Expanded  State  Funded  Guardianships, \nAmended Definition of “Fictive Kin” and Family Finding (SG-HFK-FF) Projects February 2018.   \nH.  Panel Recommendation # 3: Expanding State Funded Guardianship \n \n1.         Project Goals/Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplates that DCFS \nwill amend its administrative rules to expand the eligibility for state funded guardianship.  \nDCFS committed to completing the amendments by December 2016. Implementation Plan, p. \n39. \n2.  Status  Report:  DCFS  is  completing final rule making on DCFS  Rule \n \n302.410  which  includes  the  expanded  definition  of  state  funded  guardianship.   The \nSecond  Notice  was  filed  on  November  27,  2017  and  a  hearing  before  the  Joint \nCommittee on Administrative Rules was held in December 2017.

ACR reviewers are asking whether state funded guardianship is \nbeing pursued for all children who have a goal of guardianship and are placed in a non-licensed \nor licensed relative home.  ACR reviewers are also exploring this option if siblings under the \nage of 12 are placed in the same home as an eligible youth.   On August 1, 2017, the ACR \ninstrument was been revised to open the population to include all children with permanency \ngoals other than adoption and to take out any age restriction.  The changes were implemented to \nensure that information about whether a child meets the criteria for either KinGap or state \nfunded guardianship is captured and appropriate feedback is provided to the field.    \n  DCFS has data from ACR from July 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018.

Panel Recommendation # 3: Family Finding \n \n1.         Project Goals/Target: One of the initiatives DCFS is undertaking to ensure \nthat no youth ages out of foster care without some permanent family connection is Family \nFinding.  The  Implementation  Plan  requires  DCFS  to  implement  specific  “family  finder” \nstrategies  as  part  of  permanency  planning  for  adolescents  who  do  not  have  an  obvious \nreunification plan. Implementation Plan, p. 40.   The goal of DCFS’s Family Finding strategy is \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 37 of 57 PageID #:4096\n \nto improve permanency outcomes for all youth by identifying family that can serve as potential \nplacements, supports or resources for youth.  Implementation Plan, pp. 40-42.  \n2.  Status Report:   Beginning April 1, 2017, ACR staff are required to ask  \nquestions  at every ACR to assure that family finding activities have been completed.  DCFS \nhas data from ACR from July 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018.  Exhibit O, Data Report.

Revised Targets / Goals:  \n \n     There are no revised targets and goals.  \n   \n   H.  Panel Recommendation #4: \nRetain an organizational consultant to aid DCFS in “rebooting” a number of stalled \ninitiatives that are intended to address the needs of children and youth with psychological, \nbehavioral  or  emotional  challenges  (Implementation  Plan,  pp.  42-43).  Recommendation  #4 \naddresses two points - DCFS reorganization, and “rebooting” stalled initiatives intended to meet \nthe needs of specific youth.  DCFS identified two initiatives that needed to be “rebooted.”  \nDCFS’s reorganization and those two programs – Birth to Three (IB3) and Safe Families for \nChildren  (SFC)  –  are  discussed  below.    In  addition,  DCFS  identified  various  IT  projects, \nincluding updating or expanding certain information systems and applications and implementing \na data analytics system intended to alert investigators of children at exceptionally high risk of \nserious harm, as part of its response to this Recommendation.  Those projects are also addressed \nbelow.   There are no updates to this section.  \nI.  Expert Panel Recommendation # 4:  Reorganization \n1.         Project Goals / Target: The Implementation Plan called for DCFS to create \na high level unit with cross-organization authority to develop an implementation plan, manage \nthe implementation  and  resolve  system  barriers.  It  is  also  noted  that  the  organizational \nconsultant should evaluate the organizational structure and culture of DCFS; the effectiveness of \nDCFS’  policies,  procedures  and  programs;  the  effectiveness  of  DCFS’s  leadership  and \nmanagerial structure  and  function  and  to  assess  the  supervisory  functions  of  the  agency.   \nImplementation Plan at pp. 42-43. \n2.

Revised Targets / Goals:  None at this time. \nJ.  Panel Recommendation # 4:  Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) \n  1.  Project Goals / Target: \n \nThe  Illinois  Birth  Thru  Three  (IB3)  is  a  five-year  federal  demonstration  project \nthat began in 2012 which DCFS will complete within the original timeframe specified in the \nterms and conditions of its IV-E waiver agreement with the federal government. The project \nprovides  two  evidence-based  interventions,  singly  or  in  combination  –  Child  Parent \nPsychotherapy (CPP) and Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) – to parents and children in Cook \nCounty, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility, in order to reunify children with their parents more \nquickly and reduce the risk of re-entry to the child welfare system.  Implementation Plan, pp. \n22-26. \n2.   Status Report:  The target number of children to be served through the program \nis 2,400 and currently 2,230 children have been referred to the program.   There have been 303 \nnew cases during Fiscal Year 2018. There is a balance of those cases across the intervention \ngroup and the comparison group.  Exhibit P, Four Month Status Report, Illinois Birth Through \nThree Project (January 2018). \nOn November 2, 2017, an IBE Summit was held and approximately 120 professionals \nparticipated.  A  highlight  of  the  summit  was  a  panel  of  foster  parents  that  shared  their \nexperiences with the Nurturing Parenting Program. The foster parents shared that while they \nwere initially resistant to the program, they did find new information that was necessary for the \ncare of their young children. They also found the support of fellow group members to be critical \nfor the challenge task of fostering  Exhibit P, Four Month Status Report, Illinois Birth Through \nThree Project (December 2017). \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 40 of 57 PageID #:4099\n \nAt the end of the calendar year, Cheryl Lawrence, who served as the project manager \nsince the inception of the waiver retired.  Additionally, Latiffany Connelly, who supported \nproject coordination, moved to a new position. Responsibilities have been reallocated while a \nreplacement for the coordinator position is being sought. Exhibit P, Four Month Status Report, \nIllinois Birth Through Three Project (January 2018). \nThe Medicaid analyst completed an analysis of Medicaid data pertaining to the Child-\nParent Psychotherapy contracts during this reporting period.  The report found there was a 69% \nincrease in Medicaid billing and a 79% increase in the number of  cases served from FY16 to \nFY17.  Exhibit P, Four Month Status Report, Illinois Birth Through Three Project (January \n2018). \nWith respect to the interventions, approximately 33% of the children that have been \nserved by IB3 have been recommended for our most intensive therapeutic intervention. With \nrespect to the Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) part of the project, there are currently 81 open \ncases that are currently assigned to CPP providers.  There have been a total of 94 CPP referrals \nin FY18 as of December 31, 2017, which is the highest number of referrals within a six month \nreporting period since the start of the demonstration.  Additionally, successful case closures over \nthe lifetime of the demonstration are now at 30%; 30 child cases (45%) have been closed \nsuccessfully with a foster parent and 37 child cases (55%) have been closed successfully with a \nbiological parent.  Exhibit P, Four Month Status Report, Illinois Birth Through Three Project \n(January 2018) \nWith  respect  to  the  Nurturing  Parenting  Program  (NPP)  part  of  the  project,  the \nimplementation support team focused on referrals of biological parents to the NPP-PV, the \nprogram focusing specifically on biological parents.  During this reporting period, there were \n131 referrals which is a 54% increase in referrals from the last reporting period.  The NPP-CV \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 41 of 57 PageID #:4100\n \nprogram, which is the intervention for foster parents continues to make substantial progress.  \nDuring this reporting period, 31 foster parents have completed the program.  Exhibit P, Four \nMonth Status Report, Illinois Birth Through Three Project (January 2018) \nThe Implementation Support Team continues to work to build capacity and engage \ncaseworkers and supervisors on issues of permanency for IB3 families.  The Implementation \nSupport Team met with individual workers, supervisors and teams and provided IB3 training \nand  education  on  issues  such  as  engagement,  court  testimony  and  documentation.  The \nImplementation Support Team conducted 359 case status reviews in November.  \nThe IB3 evaluation team is preparing the semi-annual report that is due in January 2018.   \nThe current plan is to provide more detailed descriptive data on the population as well as new \noutcome data.  DCFS has contracted with the University of Illinois at Chicago Survey Research \nLaboratory to do the evaluation. The final caseworker interviews reflect an 80% response rate. \nCaregiver interviews are now underway. \nProgram Outputs: \n \nComp\nProgram Outputs  Program   Significance and \narison  \n(per Outputs in Logic Model)  (%, N)                                     Explanation of Difference \n(%, N) \nMean for engagement = 72 \n%  Engagement reflects 30-day \nMean for successful case  intervals. 2% increase in \nProgram Output 1-CPP  closure =31%   0  successful case closure. \n Successful completion for  Retention rates reflect \nthose enrolled across the 3  enrolled participants who \nProgram Output 2-NPP- agencies reporting data is  complete intake and attend \nPV  62%.   0  the initial session. \nRetention rates reflect \nSuccessful completion for  enrolled participants who \nProgram Output 3-NPP- those enrolled for FY’ 18  complete intake and attend \nCV  is 77%.  0  the initial session. \n \n3.

Recommendation # 4:  SAFE Families for Children (SFC) \n1.         Project Goals / Target:  The core objectives of SFC include deflection of \nyouth  from  child  welfare  custody,  child  abuse  prevention,  and  family  support  and \nstabilization. As noted in the First Interim Triannual Report to the Court, the program cannot be \nevaluated until there are a total of 475 families in the control group and 475 families in the \ncomparison group. Due to low engagement, DCFS has reexamined and modified the process \nfor engaging families in SFC so that the evaluation can be completed.  SFFC has been in place \nin northern Illinois for over ten years and was expanded statewide in October 2015, but even \nafter that participation in the program has lagged behind expectations. Implementation Plan, pp. \n44-46. \n  2.  Status Report:  Since November 2017, when Cook County was taken out of the \npilot, referrals to SAFE Families have decreased.  During September 2017 through October \n2017, six cases were referred to SAFE Families by the downstate regions. In November 2017, as \na result of the low number of referrals, the DCFS Deputy Director for Child Protection sent an \nemail to staff regarding the SAFE Families program and highlighting the value and use of this \nprogram. Meetings were also scheduled in various offices to provide staff information on the \nprogram.   \n          From November 2017 through February 2018, nine referrals have been received from \ndownstate regions.  The DCFS Deputy Director of Child Protection, SAFE Families staff and the \nevaluators engaged in discussions to attempt to determine the reason for the number of referrals. \nOne potential issue is that many new child protection investigators have been hired and training.  \nDCFS agreed to schedule another round of meetings with staff in individual offices. The focus of \nthese meetings will be slightly different than the prior round of meetings DCFS held with staff.  \nThe upcoming meetings will be presented in a round table discussion and seek to get local staff \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 43 of 57 PageID #:4102\n \nto honestly identify any barriers that may prevent utilization of this program.   The Deputy \nDirector of Child Protection also requested that the SAFE Families local supervisor drop in at \nvarious local offices so that investigative staff he can build a relationship with local investigative \nstaff.    This  process  commenced  during  this  reporting  period  and  the  SAFE  Families  local \nsupervisor reported positive feedback regarding his office visits and the SAFE Families program.  \nThe Deputy Director of Child Protection also plans to be in touch with the evaluator regarding \nsuggestions for the referral issue during the next reporting period. Exhibit Q, Four Month Status \nReport, SAFE Families for Children Project (March 2018).  \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \n \n  There are no revised targets or goals as the focus during the next reporting period will be \non increasing referrals to the SAFE Families program downstate.  \n  L.  Panel Recommendation # 4: Information Systems \n \nThe Implementation Plan requires DCFS to take a number of steps to enhance or replace \ndata systems to generate more timely, accurate and complete data. \nShort  term  goals,  with  a  targeted  completion  between  March  and  September  2017, \ninclude enhancement of the existing SACWIS system to accept educational data provided by \nISBE and unusual incident reporting from private agencies, as well as improvements in mobile \ntechnology  through  a  mobile  application  for  caseworkers,  on-line  foster  parent  licensing \napplication, and a tablet application for licensing site inspections.  Implementation Plan, pp. \n48- 52. \nLong-term goals, with a targeted completion date of September 2019, are replacement of \nthe existing SACWIS system, and implementation of predictive analytics. Implementation Plan, \npp. 48-52.  Regarding predictive analytics, DCFS committed to establishing an internal team \nin OITS to bring reporting needs and data analytics into a centrally managed organization. In \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 44 of 57 PageID #:4103\n \nthe short term, DCFS elected to use Mindshare as the platform for its data analytics. This \nproduct allows DCFS to merge and analyze data from multiple environments and produce \nreports for more informed decision making in a dashboard format.  Ultimately, DCFS intends to \nestablish a statewide enterprise data analytics platform (“Enterprise IT”) to reduce reliance on \nexternal entities to collect and analyze data to drive outcomes. Implementation Plan, pp. 49-51. \nAchievement of that goal is not anticipated until December 2018. \n2.  Status Report: \n \nReplacement  of  SACWIS:   The Public Consulting Group, Inc. (PCG) continues its \nwork on the feasibility  study  for the new CCWIS system.  PCG completed all five of the \ndeliverables for Phase 1, Initiation for the CCWIS Feasibilty Study and Roadmap and Phase 2, \nPlanning.  Phase 3, Requirements:  As Is and To Be, is currently underway and includes contact \nwith  youth  in  care,  adoptive  parents,  DCFS  licensing  ad  DCFS  IT.    PCG  also  conducted \ninformation sessions to identify requirements for the computer system with the Birth Parent \nCouncil  and  Performance  Based  Contracting  (Residential)  staff.    The  next  steps  including \ndevelopment  of  the  Business  Requirement  Documents  and  the  Gap  Analysis  Deliverable \nExpectation Document.   Exhibit R, Information Technology/CCWIS Status Report (December \n2017).   \nMindshare. DCFS extended the contract with Mindshare for one year and is continuing \nto work with Mindshare to complete validation on the CFSR dashboards.   DCFS will also \nbuild dashboards, beginning with the CFSR dashboards using internal DCFS IT \nstaff.   \nShort  Term  Improvement  of  Existing  SACWIS:    The  Significant  Event  Report \nsystem was launched on February 24, 2017 and continues to be in place. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 45 of 57 PageID #:4104\n \nMobile Applications:  Version 2 of Case Access mobile app was released in April \n2017 and continues to be in use for DCFS staff.    \n  OnLine Licensing Application:   The online licensing application remains in a pilot \nstage given the priority list for It projects.  \n  Predictive  Analytics:    DCFS  did  not  renew  its  contract  with  outside  vendors  for \npredictive analytics and provided notice of that to plaintiffs’ counsel.  \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals: \nReplacement of SACWIS.  PCG continues work on the feasibility study for the new \nCCWIS system and completion date is anticipated to be in the fall of 2018.  \nPredictive Analytics.  DCFS will be building predictive analytics into the new CCWIS \nsystem and that will be included in the request for proposal that is issued for the CCWIS system. \nM.  Panel Recommendation #5: \n \nRestore funding for the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (ISCAW) \nthat uses standardized instruments and assessment scales. Implementation Plan, p. 53. \n1.        Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplated restoration of \nfunding for the ISCAW well-being study. \n2.         Status Report:  The study is underway and as of January 2017, 117 caseworker \ninterviews and 26 caregiver interviews have been completed.  Data collection is anticipated to \nbe completed in the spring and the initial report from the data in anticipated to be completed by \nJune 30, 2018.  Exhibit S, Four Month Status Report ILSCAW (January 2018).   \nUniversity of Illinois Survey Research Lab (SRL) has been collaborating with staff at \nNorthwestern University to enrich the study by adding baseline CANS data from the integrated \nAssessment.  SRL staff is also currently exploring how to integrate educational data available \ninto the well-being study. Exhibit S, Four Month Status Report ILSCAW (January 2018).    \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 46 of 57 PageID #:4105\n \nSome issues with the initial sample files have recently been resolved.  The initial sample \nfiles contained names of caseworkers that SRL determined were not accurate.  When this issue \nwas brought to the attention of DCFS IT staff, they were able to provide updated sample files \nthat corrected the issue. In January 2018, SRL began contacting caseworkers and foster parents. \nExhibit S, Four Month Status Report ILSCAW (January 2018).  \nTraining for individuals conducting interview of youth in care has been completed.  SRL \nhad to modify the protocol to send consents for interviews of youth in care through the DCFS \nsecure document transfer system instead of an email mailbox.  This requires an amendment that \nis currently being reviewed by the Institutional Review Board. Exhibit S, Four Month Status \nReport ILSCAW (January 2018).     \nSRL has developed a protocol for obtaining consents, where necessary, for interviews of \nchildren in care.

Panel Recommendation #6: \nDevelop and implement a new plan for monitoring residential and group home programs, \nutilizing external partners. (Implementation Plan at p. 53). \n1.      Project Goals / Target:  The goals set out in the Implementation Plan were for \nDCFS, with the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University, to develop a \nredesigned residential monitoring program, the goal of which is to increase the safety of youth \nplaced  at  residential  treatment  facilities  and  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  \nresidential  services  provided  at  the  residential  treatment  facilities.    As  described  in  the \nImplementation  Plan,  the  program  called  for  development  of  regional  multi-disciplinary \nmonitoring teams that would assess residential programs’ effectiveness utilizing multiple data \nsources and inputs.  Residential monitoring teams were to have been identified and training \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 47 of 57 PageID #:4106\n \nwas  to  have  begun  by  December 2016.   Implementation Plan, Exhibit YY [Dkt. 531-51].    \nDCFS partnered with Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Chicago to \ndevelop  an  improved  monitoring  system  –  the  Therapeutic  Residential  Performance \nManagement Initiative (TRPMI). Chapin Hall was selected as the evaluator for this initiative.  \nThe TRPMI pilot is designed to enhance youth treatment, progress and well-being as well as to \neffectively monitor, evaluate and promote therapeutic residential program effectiveness. \n  2.         Status   Report:    \nStaffing.  TRPMI has recently been able to hire external staff for the Clinical Specialist \npositions.  In July 2017, two Clinical Specialists were hired and in October 2017, three \nClinical Specialists were hired. These Clinical Specialists replace the DCFS Clinical staff who \nwere previously assigned to the TRPMI pilot and who subsequently returned to their regular \npositions.  TRPMI also hired a Statewide QI Specialist, who began in early November 2017.  \nIt is anticipated that once the Statewide QI Specialist is acclimated to her position, she will \ninitiate hiring of the additional QI specialists to join each of the three TRPMI teams.  Exhibit \nT, Four Month Status Report, TRPMI (Monitoring Residential and Group Homes).  \nThe DCFS Team Coordinator positions in the Southern and Northern regions remained \nvacant during this reporting period.  In October 2017, the DCFS Team Coordinator for the \nSouthern Team resigned.  Although interviews were conducted for this position in late October \n2017,  no  candidate  was  identified.    DCFS  has  re-posted  the  position.    The  DCFS  Team \nCoordinator  for  the  Northern  Team  ended  his  role  in  TRPMI  in  August  2017  by  mutual \nagreement.  DCFS has initiated the process to create an additional position, however this process \nmay  take  up  to  one  year.    Exhibit  T,  Four  Month  Status  Report,  TRPMI  (Monitoring \nResidential and Group Homes).  \nThe current TRPMI staffing is as follows:  \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 48 of 57 PageID #:4107\n \nTeam Positions Southern Team Northern Team Cook Team\nKaren Sneade \nStatewide Manager\nUIC - 1.00 FTE\nWendi Wilkins \nStatewide QI Specialist\nNorthwestern - 1.00 FTE\nChris Davidson \nData Systems Dev Specialist\nNorthwestern - .50 FTE\nLinda Karfs\nStatewide Training Coord\nNorthwestern -.50 FTE \nVacant  Vacant  Chuck Redeker \nTeam Coordinator\nDCFS - 1.00 FTE DCFS - 1.00 FTE UIC - 1.00 FTE\nKimberly Newsome  Ava Jernigan  Debra McGee \nDCFS - 1.00 FTE DCFS - 1.00 FTE UIC - 1.00 FTE\nMonitor\nBill Tourville  Dortha Nickens  Damen Trice \nDCFS - 1.00 FTE DCFS - 1.00 FTE UIC - 1.00 FTE\nErin Lewis  Pamela McQuaid  Sue Devereux \nNorthwestern - 1.00 FTE Northwestern - 1.00 FTE Northwestern -  1.00 FTE\nClinical Specialist\nTricia Stottler Pamela Slane  Deanna Hall \nNorthwestern - 1.00 FTE Northwestern - 1.00 FTE Northwestern - 1.00 FTE\nVacant  Vacant \nQI Specialist\nNorthwestern - 1.00 FTE Northwestern - 1.00 FTE  \nExhibit T, Four Month Status Report, TRPMI (Monitoring Residential and Group Homes).  \nStep-Down and TRPMI Involvement in CFTs.  TRPMI’s goal include improvements \nin the identification and process for stepping youth down from congregate care settings and \nusing the Child and Family Team meeting process as the driver of discharge planning.   \nTRPMI staff participated in 61 CFTMs between August and November 2017.  TRPMI \ndeveloped a form to measure fidelity of CFTMs to the DCFS model and this process has been \npartially implemented with the completion of 25 forms.  A review of the forms indicates that all \nof the CFTMS took place on weekdays during business hours, all but one CFTM occurred at the \nresidential  treatment  facility  and  there  was  a  lack  of  evidence  demonstrating  the  CFTM \nparticipants were prepared prior to any of the CFTMs.  Additional review of data from SACWIS \nindicates that 44% of the current TRPMI youth never had a CFTM and that when only youth \nwith return home goals are considered, 40% of those youth had a CFTM in the last 12 months \nand 50% of the youth have never had a CFTM.  TRPMI will complete additional analyses of \nthese data to develop an initiative that promotes effective CFTM planning for these youth who \nwill  soon  be  returning  to  their  parents.

During the last months of this reporting period, relatively few number of \nCASIIs were completed due in large part to numerous staffing changes.  It is anticipated that the \nthree new Clinical Specialists hired in October 2017 will be fully trained to complete CASIIs by \nJanuary 2018. A first draft of a CASII fidelity tool has been implemented and will be used to \nfurther support development of the Clinical Specialists.  Exhibit T, Four Month Status Report, \nTRPMI (Monitoring Residential and Group Homes).  \nAdditionally, one Clinical Specialist from the Cook Team is currently in training to be a \nmaster coach in Rock Island.  It is anticipated that this individual will achieve master coach \nstatus shortly after she completes her training in January 2018.  At that time, it will be necessary \nto develop a plan about how to best leverage her new skills.

The systemic barriers identified by TRPMI include significant \ndelays in the central matching process, especially with respect to youth being discharged from \nresidential treatment facilities to foster home placements, the  access to and availability of \nservices for youth with mental and behavioral health issues and lack of staff and adequate \nresidential treatment options for challenging  youth. Exhibit T,  Four  Month  Status Report, \nTRPMI (Monitoring Residential and Group Homes).  TRPMI has taken a number of steps to \naddress these systemic issues, including surveying states with mature systems of care similar \nto Illinois, such as North Carolina and New Jersey, to identify how such states maintain an \narray of residential services that provide more intensive treatment options than exist in Illinois, \nreview of DCFS data regarding youth who experience lateral and step up moves and negative \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 53 of 57 PageID #:4112\n \ndischarges, such as out of state placements and conducting a survey of Illinois residential \nproviders, DCFS leadership and DCFS staff and other stakeholders for insight on the matching \nand placement process for residential treatment facilities.   \nThe implementation barriers include data systems and staffing issues.  In addition, nine \nof the sixteen residential agencies currently involved in the TRPMI Pilot require enhanced levels \nof  monitoring  intervention.  As  safety  concerns  with  respect  to  these  programs  must  be \nprioritized, TPMI continues to devote significant resources to these agencies, which diverts \nTRPMI from its  primary mission of effectively connecting youth to families and community \nresources.

Members of the Evaluation Subcommittee are participating \nin an ad hoc workgroup with the Implementation Subcommittee to refine, organize, and \nlink  team  activities  to  measurable  outputs.  Output  definitions  are  currently  being \nfinalized. \nIV.  Communication Plan:  Implement a Defined Communication Plan with the B.H. \n  Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ Attorneys.  (Implementation Plan, p. 55). \n  1.  Progress Goals / Target:  A Communication Plan, entered by the Court on \nSeptember 28, 2016 [Dkt. 530], provides for bi-weekly conferences with the Expert Panel and \nthe Parties, during which the pilots and programs identified in the Implementation Plan are \ndiscussed.  The plan provides for DCFS to provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel which details the specific steps that have been taken in actual implementation \nof each initiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers \nthat exist and strategies to eliminate or resolve the barriers, and an evaluation of program results.  \nThe Plan also provides for DCFS to make efforts proactively to share information “beyond that \nwhich directly relates to the specific initiatives described in the  Implementation Plan” that \nnevertheless is significant.   \n  2.  Status Report:  During this reporting period, all required telephone conferences \nand  meetings  have  been  held  and  monthly  reports  have  been  produced  and  posted  on  a \nSharepoint site to which the parties and the Expert Panel have access. Regular Tuesday bi-\n53 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 55 of 57 PageID #:4114\n \nweekly calls were held during which DCFS project managers provided updates on the pilot \nprojects in the B.H. Implementation Plan. Generally, attendees included the project managers, \nsome  of  the  evaluators,  other  DCFS  employees,  the  Expert  Panel  members  and  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel.  The Expert Panel members provided “coaching sessions” for various project managers \nwho would go through their projects in great detail.  In addition, there are regular bi-weekly \nteleconferences with the parties and the Expert Panel.  The Expert Panel routinely prepares an \nagenda for these calls.  \n  The parties determined that monthly in-person meetings with the Expert Panel and the \nparties would be more productive than bi-weekly calls.  The monthly in-person meetings were \nheld on January 9 and February 5, 2018, and the next monthly meeting is scheduled for March \n15, 2018.   \nThere continue to be instances in which the Experts and the Plaintiffs have flagged a \npotential problem or issue and have asked questions, and DCFS makes its best effort to provide \ntimely responses.      \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals:  DCFS will continue in its efforts to comply with all \nrequirements of the Communication Plan.  This new process for having monthly in-person \nmeetings will be reported on in the next triannual report to the Court.  \nV.  Project for a Target Group of Children and Youth/Enhanced IPS Program Beyond \n  Medical Necessity Pilot \n  1.  Progress  Goals  /  Target:    The  Enhanced  Intensive  Placement  Stabilization \nProgram/Beyond  Medical  Necessity  pilot  was  designed  to  provide  immediate  services  to \nstabilize youth in a home setting after a psychiatric hospitalization.  Amended  and  Revised \nImplementation Plan, pp. 56-57; Exhibit U, Enhanced IPS for Youth That Are at Risk to \nBecome Beyond Medical Necessity Pilot, Four Month Status Report, September – December \n54 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 56 of 57 PageID #:4115\n \n2017, dated 2/1/2018; Exhibit V, Enhanced IPS Flow Chart.  The current pilot provides a \nconsultant that works with the entire treatment team, including the family where the youth is \nplaced, the caseworker, the school and other therapeutic providers, to connect the family with \nintensive community-based services and resources to support the youth and family in order to \nmaintain the placement and prevent future hospitalizations.  \n  This pilot is projected to end June 30, 2019.   \n2.  Status Report: \n  Hiring.   A second Placement Stabilization Consultant started in September 2017.  Jill \nTichenor, Associate Deputy Director for Clinical Assessment and Monitor, is now assisting \nLeslie Berg, the Project Manager, with this pilot.  The decision has been made to hire one \nadditional Placement Stabilization Consultant. \n  Tracking and Assessment.  Kaleidoscope has also established clearer timeframes and \ndeveloped an assessment tool and a Child and Family Team action plan to formalize this process.  \nA process has been developed to identify and track the control and experimental group, to \ninclude working with Northwestern University on CANS comparison data, the Illinois \nDepartment of Information Technology  on CFTM frequency for both the control and \nexperimental group, and with Kaleidoscope’s quality improvement staff on CANS completion, \ncomparison data and outcome data collection.   \n  Children Served.  Seven youth have been assigned to the pilot since September, one of \nwhich was assigned in December.  The numbers below include youth that were identified by \nKaleidoscope’s participation in the Psychiatric Hospitalization Staffings. \nTotal population of youth assigned as of 12/31/17  Amount \nYouth Assigned since May 2017  15** \nYouth discharge from Pilot due to success and stability in home  0 \nYouth discharged from Pilot due to a recommendation for congregant  care  1 \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 604 Filed: 03/08/18 Page 57 of 57 PageID #:4116\n \n**one youth involved in the pilot is now receiving residential treatment and is no longer part of \nthe pilot \n*** this does not include the 3 youth that were initially assigned to the pilot as the process and \nimplementation were not formalized.  \n \n  Proximal and Distal Data.   Proximal and distal outcome data discloses the following \nwith respect to recommendations for placement:  \n•  Percent of youth where a recommendation is made to remain with the previous \ncaretaker:  47% of youth in the pilot; 60% of youth in the comparison group.  \n \n•  Percent of youth where recommendation is to reside in a home environment with \ncommunity and agency supports other than in his or her pre-admission placement:  \n53% of youth in the pilot; 40% of youth in the comparison group. \n  Proximal and distal outcome data also discloses the following comparison for youth who \nreceive Kaleidoscope Enhanced IPS Services: \n  Proximal/Distal Outcome  Program  Comparison \nYouth re hospitalized since identified  5 =33%  3 = 20% \nhospitalization \nYouth who remain in same placement prior  8=53%  10= 67% \nto hospitalization  \nYouth who remain with the same agency  12=80%  10=67% \nsince psychiatrically hospitalized \nYouth who remain with the same agency  8= 53%  8= 53% \nand child welfare specialist since \npsychiatrically discharged. \n \n3.  Revised Targets / Goals \n \nHiring.  Kaleidoscope will pursue hiring of the third Stabilization Consultant.  \n  Tracking Outputs, Proximal and Distal Outcomes.  There are ongoing discussions \nconcerning tracking. The pilot currently uses the Psychiatric Hospitalization Tracking Database  \nto track data regarding all youth that are psychiatrically hospitalized.   Since the pilot at this time \ninvolves only a small segment of the total population of psychiatrically hospitalized youth, \ninformation is tracked on an Excel tracking sheet.   Continued discussions are needed regarding \nformulating business rules and completed validation measures.  \n56 \n ",

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN \nIntroduction   \nIn April 2015, this Court appointed a panel of experts pursuant to Federal Rule of \nEvidence 706 to evaluate the services and placements provided to plaintiff class members with \npsychological, behavioral or emotional challenges.  In July 2015, the Expert Panel submitted a \nreport to the Court outlining specific findings and making six recommendations for systemic \nchange at DCFS.  Under the leadership of then-newly appointed Director George H. Sheldon, \nDCFS did not dispute the factual findings and committed to address the challenges described by \nthe Expert Panel.  DCFS is committed to take action to correct systemic deficiencies and to strive \nfor the safety, permanence, and wellbeing of children and youth in care.   \nIn October 2015, the Court adopted the Expert Panel’s findings, subject to certain \nrevisions proposed by the parties, and reappointed an Expert Panel.  The October 2015 Order \ncontemplates collaboration of the parties and the Expert Panel to develop an implementation plan \nfor DCFS to follow as it addresses systemic reform. \nAlthough Director Sheldon was initiating multiple steps to address the challenges and \nconcerns he observed at DCFS, the July 2015 Expert Panel recommendations sparked further \nurgency and a broader approach to DCFS reform.  DCFS now has a number of critical and \ninnovative initiatives under way that are intended to address many of the underlying challenges \nreferenced in the report, but there is still a long way to go to implement those initiatives fully in \norder to evaluate and sustain their success.  These initiatives are being implemented in \naccordance with the requirements of implementation science.  Work has already begun to spread \nseeds of cultural change, a sense of urgency and clear planning and ownership at multiple levels \nof DCFS.  Success in those efforts will be a critical factor as the broader work begins.  In \naddition, DCFS continues its work to determine an overarching strategy that will connect \n \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 5 of 60 PageID #:1001\n \nprojects and initiatives together to truly reform the child welfare system and in so doing address \nthe psychological, behavioral and emotional needs of the Plaintiff class.  \nThe Parties jointly submitted the DCFS B.H. Implementation Plan to the Court on \nFebruary 23, 2016.  Since the submission of the Implementation Plan, at the Court’s instruction, \nthe parties have submitted additional and supplemental information regarding the initiatives in \nthe Implementation Plan.  These are incorporated into this Amended and Revised DCFS B.H. \nImplementation Plan.  \nThis Amended and Revised Implementation Plan sets forth the specific steps DCFS will \ntake to begin addressing the six recommendations and the specific needs of children and youth in \ncare with psychological, behavioral or emotional challenges.  Additionally, in accordance with \nimplementation science, each initiative contains a logic model which incorporates the Expert \nPanel’s comments. \nThe Plan represents a core component of the overarching DCFS strategic plan a draft of \nwhich has been published for public comment.  The direction of DCFS is to embed child and \nfamily centered practice into a system where all leaders, administrators and staff have a sense of \nurgency toward reaching the best possible outcomes for children and families in Illinois.   \nI.  Implementation Plan Leadership \nWith the input of the Expert Panel, DCFS has appointed Pete Digre as Deputy Director \nfor Placement and Community Services with complete authority and responsibility for \noperationalizing the Implementation Plan.  Mr. Digre reports directly to Director Sheldon and \nhas authority to direct DCFS staff and private providers, and to assign staff to specific aspects \nof the Implementation Plan.  This definition of authority and unequivocal leadership will \nassist in the breakdown of silos between divisions and drive implementation in a cohesive and \nintegrated manner. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 6 of 60 PageID #:1002\n \nMr. Digre has extensive experience in developing and implementing child welfare \nprograms in Illinois, Philadelphia, Florida and Los Angeles, including specialized intensive and \ntherapeutic foster care programs.  Exhibit A, Resume of Pete Digre.   \nII.  Application of Implementation Science to the Implementation Plan \nIn developing the overall Implementation Plan as submitted on February 23, 2016, DCFS \nwas guided by principles of implementation science as put forth by the National Implementation \nResearch Network (NIRN).  These principles suggest that successful implementation requires \nthoughtful phasing (“Stages of Implementation”), teaming, and continuous data monitoring \n(“Plan-Do-Study-Act” cycles), as well as careful examination of organizational drivers that may \nhelp or hinder innovation and provide the organizational capacity to address technical and \nadaptive challenges.  Exhibit B, Stages of Implementation Analysis:  Where Are We?; \nImplementation Science:  Changing Hearts, Minds, Behavior and Systems to Improve \nEducational Outcomes. \nA logic model for each initiative and project has been developed and reviewed by the \nExpert Panel.  Logic models are graphical depictions of the logical relationships between the \nresources, activities, outputs, and outcomes of a program.  Logic models are tools used by \nevaluators of programs to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. One of the important uses \nof logic models is for program planning, helping program managers to plan with the end or \ndesired results in mind.  See Designing Evaluations, Applied Research and Methods, U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office, 2012 Revision.     \nIn order to operationalize the Implementation Plan in a structured way, evaluation \ntemplates were prepared by Mark Testa to assist the Strategic Planning and Innovation Division \nand DCFS project managers and staff.  The templates are adapted from materials that Dr. Testa \nhelped develop.  Exhibit C, A Framework To Design, Test, Spread, and Sustain Effective \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 7 of 60 PageID #:1003\n \nPractice in Child Welfare, Children’s Bureau, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (2014). \n Logic models and status reports based on the evaluation templates are provided for each \npilot and initiative described in the Implementation Plan.  \n  The National Implementation Science Research Network (NIRN) will assist DCFS in the \napplication of implementation science to its implementation efforts for the B.H. Implementation \nPlan.  DCFS is in the process of completing the contract with Alison Metz, NIRN Senior \nScientist.  After consultation with the Expert Panel, the current plan will require Dr. Metz to \nreview and comment on DCFS’s adherence to best practices in implementation science and assist \nwith an assessment of DCFS’s implementation capacity and strategy.  DCFS will provide NIRN \nwith logic models and implementation plans for each separate pilot, project and initiative.  With \nrespect to each initiative, Dr. Metz will provide guidance and direction on: what is going well, \nthe identification of potential barriers to implementation of reform, and possible ways to \novercome and address such barriers.  In particular, Dr. Metz will offer guidance around the \narchitecture and teaming structure of the pilots, projects and initiatives.  In addition, DCFS will, \nas needed, seek assistance from Dr. Metz as implementation moves forward.  Under the \nconsulting arrangement, the Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel members will be permitted to freely \ncommunicate with Dr. Metz about their work on an ex parte basis.      \nIII.  Overarching Outcome Measures  \nAs a result of collaboration with the Expert Panel and DCFS consultant Dr. Mark \nCourtney, DCFS identified specific outcome metrics to assess the safety, permanency and \nwellbeing of class members.  These metrics are intended to monitor changes in both the quality \nof, and capacity to provide, services and supports for children and families in the Illinois child \nwelfare system.  Notably, every state child welfare system is measured by the United States \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 8 of 60 PageID #:1004\n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families.  For \npurposes of this Implementation Plan, DCFS will use the same safety and permanency outcome \nmeasures that are currently utilized by the federal government in the Child and Family Service \nReview (CFSR) process.  The data for the safety, permanency, and stability metrics will be \ndrawn from existing DCFS data sources and based on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis \nand Reporting System (AFCARS) and National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n(NCANDS). Though not as a measure of compliance with the Expert Panel’s report, DCFS will \nroutinely track and monitor other data indicators as part of this Implementation Plan that are \ndiscussed under Recommendation #4.  See discussion infra at pp. 42-52.    \nThe CFSR, however, does not track wellbeing outcomes with specificity.  Therefore, \nDCFS will use wellbeing measures developed by the Illinois Child Welfare Advisory Committee \n(CWAC) Sub-Committee on Wellbeing.  CWAC was established pursuant to executive order \nand provides counsel regarding emerging policy issues and best practices in child welfare. The \nCWAC Sub-Committee on Wellbeing is comprised of experienced, credentialed DCFS and \nprivate agency stakeholders and child welfare experts at Northwestern University. Exhibit D, \nCWAC Sub-Committee and Sub-Committee membership list.  \n  A.  Safety \nThe selected safety measure from the CFSR is maltreatment in foster care:  \n“Of all children in foster care during a 12-month period, what is the rate of victimization \n  per day of foster care?”   \n \nSee Exhibit E, Final Notice of Statewide Data Indicators and National Standards for Child and \nFamily Services Reviews.  \nB.   Permanency and Stability  \nThe selected permanency and stability measures are:  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 9 of 60 PageID #:1005\n \n1.  Permanency in 12 months for children entering foster care:  “Of all children who \nenter foster care in a 12-month period, what percent are discharged to permanency \nwithin 12 months of entering foster care?” \n \n2.  Permanency in 12 months for children in foster care 12 to 23 months:   “Of all \nchildren in foster care on the first day of a 12-month period who had been in foster \ncare (in that episode) between 12 and 23 months, what percent discharged from foster \ncare to permanency within 12 months of the first day of the period?” \n \n3.  Permanency in 12 months for children in foster care 24 months or more:  “Of all \nchildren in foster care on the first day of a 12-month period, who had been in foster \ncare (in that episode) for 24 months or more, what percent discharged to permanency \nwithin 12 months of the first day?” \n \n4.  Re-entry to foster care in 12 months:  “Of all children who enter foster care in a 12-\nmonth period who discharged within 12 months to reunification, living with a \nrelative, or guardianship, what percent re-enter foster care within 12 months of their \ndischarge?”  \n \n5.  Placement stability:  “Of all children who enter foster care in a 12-month period, what \nis the rate of placement moves per day of foster care?”  \n \nC.  Wellbeing \nBecause the CFSR process does not provide for specific data measures for child \nwellbeing, DCFS will measure wellbeing based on a matrix that was developed by the CWAC \nSub-Committee.  The matrix is premised on the four functional domains (cognitive functioning; \nphysical health; emotional/behavioral functioning; and social functioning).  The CWAC Sub-\nCommittee has submitted a final matrix which has been forwarded to the Expert Panel for \nreview.  Exhibit F, Matrix.  \nMany of the wellbeing indicators in the matrix will be gathered from existing DCFS data \nsources.  For the indicators that are not currently available because DCFS does not have \naccessible data sources, the DCFS Office of Information Technology will develop and \nincorporate data sources to measure the outcomes associated with the wellbeing matrix.  \nOne of the existing DCFS data sources from which the wellbeing indicators will be \ngathered is the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strength Assessment tool (CANS).   CANS \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 10 of 60 PageID #:1006\n \ndata-capturing and reporting activity is maintained by the Northwestern University Illinois \nOutcomes system. To assess the validity of CANS findings, DCFS will develop and implement \nin the selected immersion sites an independent quality service and progress review consisting of \nthe periodic collection of data from external sources, such as children and youth, foster parents \nand teachers to compare to CANS findings. The Psychiatric Hospital database has been finalized.  \nIt permits DCFS to collect data regarding youth who have been and are currently psychiatrically \nhospitalized, critical information to confirm the CANS.   \nIn addition, DCFS is developing a database for data from the Illinois State Board of \nEducation (ISBE) that will include the Student Information System that monitors a student’s \nprogress over time and tracks school enrollment, attendance and progress. The DCFS technology \nupgrade required to allow the acceptance of this data into the Statewide Automated Child \nWelfare Information System (SACWIS) is due to be completed in 6-12 months.  \nIV.  Implementation of Specific Recommendations of the Expert Panel \n  A.  Recommendation #1: Institute a children’s system of care demonstration   \n  program that permits POS agencies and DCFS sub-regions to waive    \n  selected policy and funding restrictions on a trial basis in order to reduce   \n  the use of residential treatment and help children and youth succeed in    \n  living in the least restrictive, most family-like setting. \n \nDCFS will begin implementing Recommendation #1 through four pilot projects targeted \nat populations of children with emotional and behavioral needs and/or youth involved in both the \njuvenile justice and child welfare systems (“dually involved”).  The goal of the pilot projects is \nto reduce lengths of stay in residential facilities and increase placements in community and \nhome-based settings.  DCFS is committed to the pilot project process, and the four pilots \ndescribed below have been launched.  Each of these pilots includes a rigorous evaluation \ncomponent.   If the evaluation demonstrates that the pilots are meeting stated goals, it is \nanticipated that they will be rolled out more broadly across the state. If they are not effective, \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 11 of 60 PageID #:1007\n \nthey will be modified or discontinued, and alternative approaches will be pursued as appropriate \nand necessary.   \n  1.   Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots \n    a.  Pilot Overview \nDCFS will pilot the use of therapeutic foster care through evidence-based or evidence-\ninformed models in three sites over the next five years.  Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) is a \ncommunity-based service for children and youth whose emotional or behavioral health needs \ncan be met through services delivered primarily by foster parents, as an alternative to high-\nend, restrictive placements such as residential treatment, incarceration, and/or psychiatric \nhospitalization.  See http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5310a1.htm.  The goal \nof the Therapeutic Foster Care Pilot is to develop and test the effectiveness of various models \nof Therapeutic Foster Care for children and youth with emotional disturbance who are in \nDCFS custody. \n    i.  Theory of Change  \nThe  Theory of Change employed by DCFS in the therapeutic foster care pilot is that \nchildren and youth thrive when cared for within a home and family environment and that \nplacement in a residential setting is a point-in-time intervention to respond to the clinical \nneeds of children and youth.  Therapeutic foster care will be implemented in areas of high \nneed in Illinois to reduce the number of youth in residential treatment facilities and increase \nboth placement stability and clinical functioning.  Exhibit G, DCFS Logic Model and Status \nReport, Therapeutic Foster Care.    \nDCFS set a two-year goal for each program for the recruitment of therapeutic foster \nparents and placements.  This goal will include the placement of a minimum of 40 children \nand youth in TFC licensed homes at the end of the first contractual year; and placement of a \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 12 of 60 PageID #:1008\n \nminimum of 100 children and youth in TFC licensed homes at the end of the second \ncontractual year. At least 60% of the youth served in TFC licensed homes will be aged 12 \nyears and over.  Exhibit H, Chart of TFC programs with numbers. \n    b.    Development of Therapeutic Foster Care Evidenced-Based Models   \nDCFS began the pilot project in September 2015 with the issuance of request for \nproposals for TFC programs.  The programs were targeted for Cook, Kane and Winnebago \ncounties based on an analysis of the current DCFS population by Chapin Hall at the \nUniversity of Chicago (Chapin Hall), because those areas were found to have the highest need \nfor alternative placements for youth with serious emotional or behavioral health needs.     \nDCFS identified three groups of children and youth for the TFC pilots which include:  \nchildren who without more intensive services were likely to later enter residential care (i.e., \ndeflection group, later entry), children who were entering residential care directly upon \nplacement with DCFS (i.e., deflection group, direct entry), and children who were ready for \nstep down from residential care (i.e., step-down group).  DCFS specifically identified these \ngroups to correspond with the requirements of the Children and Family Services Act.1 \nDCFS received twenty-six responses to the RFP, which were reviewed and analyzed.   \nA pre-bidders conference was held to answer questions from bidders.  DCFS then scored the \nproposals based on a matrix developed in collaboration with Chapin Hall.  In early 2016, \n                                                 \n1 The Act provides: “Multi-dimensional treatment foster care. Subject to appropriations, beginning June 1, \n2016, the Department shall implement a 5-year pilot program of multi-dimensional treatment foster care, \nor a substantially similar evidence-based program of professional foster care, for (i) children entering care \nwith severe trauma histories, with the goal of returning the child home or maintaining the child in foster \ncare instead of placing the child in congregate care or a more restrictive setting or placement, (ii) children \nwho require placement in foster care when they are ready for discharge from a residential treatment \nfacility, and (iii) children who are identified for residential or group home care and who, based on a \ndetermination made by the Department, could be placed in a foster home if higher level interventions are \nprovided.”  20 ILCS 505/5.40. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 13 of 60 PageID #:1009\n \nbidders with top scores gave oral presentations to DCFS staff.   DCFS selected three private \nagencies based on the combination of their written proposals, proposal scores, and oral \npresentations: Lutheran Social Services of Illinois (LSSI) for pilots in Cook County, Aurora \nand Rockford; Children’s Home and Aid of Illinois (CHAID) and Jewish Child and Family \nServices (JCFS) for pilots in Cook County. \nDuring the exploration phase, DCFS Chapin Hall, LSSI, CHAID and JCFS reassessed \nthe potential match between the target population, the proposed evidenced-based model, \nprogram needs, and community resources.  The exploration phase included meetings and \ndiscussions with the developers of the various evidenced-based models and consultation with \nMarci White. As a result of the Expert Panel’s guidance, each private agency modified their \noriginal proposals to implement improvements. \nLSSI will implement the Treatment Foster Care Oregon Children (TFCO) model in \ncombination with a number of programs, for children 6 – 11 years of age in all three target \nregions.  LSSI expanded their proposal to also include youth ages 12 – 14 in consultation with \nthe TFCO developers for all three sites.  LSSI will be serving 30 youth, 10 in each site.   LSSI \nwill implement a professional foster parent model where one parent will not work outside of \nthe home.  Exhibit I, LSSI Therapeutic Foster Care Implementation Plan. \nCHAID and JCFS both proposed a Therapeutic Foster Care model that meets DCFS’ \nTherapeutic Foster Care definition through implementation of the Keeping Foster and Kin \nParents Supported and Trained (KEEP) model.  After discussions with the KEEP model \ndeveloper, however, it was decided that the KEEP model was not a good fit for this population.  \nWith assistance from both Chapin Hall and Marci White, CHAID and JCFS identified other \nevidence-based interventions that would meet the DCFS Therapeutic Foster Care model \ndefinition.  CHAID will be serving youth ages 12 to 18 in the step down population.  CHAID \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 14 of 60 PageID #:1010\n \nwill be using a number of evidence-based interventions in their pilot, including Therapeutic \nCrisis Intervention for Families (TCI), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-\nCBT), Attachment, Self-Regulation and Competency (ARC), Quality Parenting Initiative \n(QPI), Excellence Academy and Adult Connections.  Exhibit J, CHAID Therapeutic Foster \nCare: Implementation Plan and Theory of Change.  Through the use of the above mentioned \nprograms, CHAID will serve youth in Cook County and anticipates serving ten youth in the \nfirst year.  \nJCFS will serve youth ages 12 to 18 in the deflection step down and trauma \npopulations.  JCFS be using the Together Facing the Challenge model, which is an evidence-\nbased practice model that provides comprehensive training for both agency staff and treatment \nfoster care parents.   JCFS anticipates serving 10 youth in the first year. Exhibit K, Jewish \nChild and Family Services Therapeutic Foster Care Pilot Implementation Plan. \nEach private agency and DCFS staff has had in person meetings with the developers of \nthe evidence-based models.  LSSI and DCFS met with the developers of TFCO on June 20, \n2016, CHAID met with the developers of TCI on August 15, 2016 and JCFS met with the \ndevelopers of Together Facing the Challenge on August 29, 2016.  The meetings allowed the \nprivate agencies and DCFS to get a clear understanding of the specific model, the required \ntraining, fidelity monitoring and sustainability issues.   DCFS has established rates and has \nfinalized grant contracts for each agency.  The grant contracts will allow the agencies to hire, \nrecruit and train staff for the pilots and each agency has begun the recruitment and hiring \nprocess.  After each agency has appropriate staff in place, DCFS will develop service contracts \nto be put in place by the time the first children or youth are placed in the pilot.   \n  c.  Oversight of TFC Implementation Steps \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 15 of 60 PageID #:1011\n \n DCFS and the private agencies developed a committee structure to provide necessary \nguidance for future decisions.  Exhibit L, Therapeutic Foster Care Committee Structure.  The \nTFC Steering Committee includes representation from each agency and high level DCFS staff \nand meets on a monthly basis. The Steering Committee serves in an advisory capacity to \nprovide input and guidance throughout both the implementation and evaluation phases.   \nSteering Committee members will assist with identifying solutions to system barriers that may \naffect implementation of evidence based practices. \nThe TFC Evaluation/Eligibility Sub-Committee is responsible for developing eligibility \ncriteria for youth entering the pilot and criteria for step down from therapeutic foster care \ntreatment.  The sub-committee will be responsible for compiling and analyzing data relevant to \ndecision making.  The sub-committee will also be responsible for developing the evaluation \nplan. The committee is co-chaired by Dr. Cynthia Tate, DCFS Senior Deputy Director, \nProgram Practice and Dr. Richard Epstein, Chapin Hall. \nImplementation sub-committees will be developed.  An implementation team will be \nestablished for each evidence-based model that is being used in the TFC pilot (Therapeutic \nFoster Care Implementation Sub Committee, Together Facing the Challenge Implementation \nSub Committee and Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Families Sub Committee.)  Each \nimplementation sub-committee will provide direction for the operational planning and initial \nand ongoing implementation of the evidence-based model.  The sub-committees will be \nresponsible for identifying barriers to implementation and decision making regarding the \nprinciples of plan- do-study-act to support information based decision making and \ncontinuous learning.        \n    d.  Evaluation by Chapin Hall \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 16 of 60 PageID #:1012\n \nThe evaluation of the TFC pilot programs will be conducted by Chapin Hall.  Chapin \nHall completed a comparison of the providers’ programs and the Foster Family Treatment \nAssociation Standards.  Exhibit M, Program Comparison.  While the evaluation component is \nnot complete, wellbeing measures will be included.  DCFS identified proximal and distal \noutcomes for the TFC pilots.  The proximal outcomes include decreased percentages of entries \nand re-entries into residential care, increased placement stability and increased clinical \nfunctioning.  The distal outcomes include increased safety, improved permanency, and improved \nwellbeing outcomes.  \n    e.  DCFS Leadership of the TFC Pilot \n    The implementation of this project will be led by Twana Cosey, M.S.W., Statewide \nRecruitment Administrator, working in close collaboration with Peter Digre.  Mr. Digre leads a \nteam that includes managers from the DCFS Clinical, Licensing, Operations and Training \nDivisions.  \n   2.  Care Management Entity Pilot \n  The Illinois Care Management Entity (CME) pilot arose out of changes that began in \n2012 in federal and state law which signaled a shift toward managed care and a potential impact \non Medicaid behavioral health services to children and youth in DCFS custody.  At the same \ntime, DCFS noticed a trend in the increased length of time that children and youth were \nremaining in care and also remaining in institutional settings.  DCFS and other state agencies \nworked with Shelia Pires, a national System of Care expert, in researching viable options to \naddress these issues for Illinois.  This work led to the identification of Choices, a CME with over \n15 years of experience providing care coordination services.  The CME pilot began in February \n2014 and currently serves DCFS youth ages three to 21 who are placed in congregate care \nsettings, in psychiatric hospitals, in specialized foster homes and in traditional foster homes, but \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 17 of 60 PageID #:1013\n \nwho are experiencing placement stability issues or who have been screened for possible \npsychiatric hospitalization through Screening, Assessment and Support Services programs. \n  The Theory of Change for this pilot is that implementation of system of care principles, \nsuch as the increased use of cost-effective home and community based services and care \ncoordination oversight, will result in better clinical and permanency outcomes for children and \nyouth with mental health conditions. The implementation of the CME pilot is set forth in the \nLogic Model.  Exhibit N, CME Logic Model.  An status report is also attached.  Exhibit O, CME \nStatus Report.  \n    a.  Pilot Overview   \n  As the CME, Illinois Choices provides care coordination services based upon Systems of \nCare principles to children with severe and complex behavioral health concerns. The pilot serves \nchildren in DCFS custody who have a head of household address or legal county of origin in \nChampaign, Ford, Iroquois or Vermilion counties and who are either: 1) in psychiatric hospitals, \nresidential /group home facilities, or specialized foster care; or 2) have been screened due to a \npsychiatric crisis; or 3) in traditional foster care and are experiencing placement stability issues.  \nThe four counties for the pilot were selected based upon high intake rates and long lengths of \nstay for children in those areas.   \n     b.  Child and Family Teaming Model  \nThe CME’s care coordination services are provided through an intensive Child and \nFamily Teaming (CFT) model that is implemented according to High Fidelity Wraparound \nstandards.  See National Wraparound Standards, attached as Exhibit P.  When a child is enrolled \nin the CME pilot, a care coordinator is assigned and begins an engagement process to establish a \nCFT that includes the child, the permanency worker, any available family members, and other \nnatural supports, such as teachers, friends, mentors and neighbors.  The care coordinator \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 18 of 60 PageID #:1014\n \nfacilitates a meeting with this CFT at least every 30 days to ensure that the child’s and family’s \nneeds are being met. The CFT uses the strengths and needs that are identified through \ncompletion of CANS when the child is enrolled to develop a Plan of Care that authorizes all \nservices required for the child and family. Those services are provided by agencies who are \nmembers of the CME’s Provider Network.  \n   Each member of the CFT has specific responsibilities.  The care coordinator is \nresponsible for scheduling and facilitating the CFT, for ensuring that all necessary services are \nproperly authorized and that access to services is streamlined. The assigned permanency worker \nis responsible for ensuring that the permanency goal drives all of the CFT planning and that \nDCFS rules, procedures and policies and all court orders are being met.  The permanency worker \nand care coordinator work as a team.  \n    c.  CME Provider Network \nThe CME provides care coordination, administration and oversight of the Provider \nNetwork, which is comprised of community-based providers who are willing to offer services to \nchildren and families enrolled in the program.  Importantly, the CME is not a direct provider of \ntherapeutic services. This permits “conflict-free” care coordination.  \n The CME pays providers directly, thus maintaining control of the network and allowing \nfor flexibility to add new providers and services as needed for an individual child.  The Provider \nNetwork began with only providers who had existing contracts with DCFS for both placement \nand therapeutic services. The CME has expanded the network to include other non-traditional \nproviders (e.g., equine therapist, mentors, family peer supports, etc.) not previously under \ncontract with DCFS. The CME Provider Network continues to expand to cover additional service \ntypes and providers.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 19 of 60 PageID #:1015\n \nHome and community-based behavioral health services currently available within the \nCME Provider Network include, but are not limited to: therapy – individual, family, group, and \nspecialty (e.g., equine); community support – individual and group; evaluation and testing \nservices; and behavior management services. Expanded child welfare support services include, \nbut are not limited to: team meeting participation; court hearing attendance; mentoring – \neducational, social, recreational, life coach, independent living skills, family and parent; tutoring; \nsupervised visitation; shared parenting and coaching; family support services including camp; \nchildcare reimbursement; transportation; incentives; utilities; supplies; activities; medical; \nclothing; and restitution and damage repaid.  \n    d.  Flexible Funding \n \nThe CME manages specific funds for “flexible spending” for each child enrolled in the \nprogram.  These funds are pooled across all children providing the opportunity to secure \nadditional creative and flexible services and supports for children with higher needs.  The CME \naccesses Medicaid reimbursed services whenever possible to ensure that flexible funds are only \nutilized for services and supports not already available in the community. \nMental health services currently available through flexible funding include home-based \nservices (utilizing evidence-informed practices), enhanced mobile crisis response, crisis \nstabilizers, crisis respite, therapeutic mentoring services, peer support and non-crisis respite.  The \ngoal is for such services to be integrated by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family \nServices (which is the Illinois State Medicaid agency) into the federally approved Medicaid \nservice array.   \n    e.  Enhanced Mobile Crisis Response \n  In April 2016, an enhanced Mobile Crisis Response program was launched as part of the \nCME pilot.  The Mobile Crisis Response program is for youth in care and also youth in the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 20 of 60 PageID #:1016\n \ncommunity who are experiencing behavioral health crises that may require hospitalization or \nmay lead to them being removed from their current placement.  This enhanced Mobile Crisis \nResponse replaces the previous pre-hospitalization screening service that was offered prior to the \nCME pilot being implemented.  The enhancements to the crisis program include a team-based \nresponse with a crisis responder and care coordinator (for children enrolled in the CME pilot), \nexpanded services available immediately to the youth/caregiver and an expanded definition of \nwhat constitutes a “crisis.”  Previously, a youth had to be experiencing a “psychiatric” crisis, \nhowever, under the new Mobile Crisis Response, a crisis can include behavioral health issues \nthat may result in the child losing their current placement or being removed from the home.  \n    f.  Goals and Outcomes for CME Pilot \nThe CME pilot is intended to keep children stabilized in the least restrictive placement \npossible, to move children to sustained permanency as soon as they are ready, and to ensure \nchildren’s and families’ interests and participation directly influence the planning and delivery of \nservices.  The goal is to develop a network of community providers who offer a long-term \ncommunity-based support system after the children achieve permanency.  \n    g.  DCFS Leadership of CME Pilot  \nThe CME pilot is administered by DCFS’s Care Coordination Office, overseen by \nKristine Herman, Associate Deputy Director of Medicaid Behavioral Health and Care \nCoordination within the Strategic Planning and Innovation Division.  The Care Coordination \nOffice authorizes all referrals to the CME, oversees the implementation of the pilot program and \nensures that administrative issues are addressed at the field level by interacting directly with both \nprivate agency and DCFS permanency workers and other staff.  \nThe Care Coordination Office is also responsible for ongoing oversight of the \nimplementation of the pilot through CME compliance reviews and quarterly and annual \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 21 of 60 PageID #:1017\n \noutcomes reports by the CME. Additional baseline data, outcomes and performance benchmarks \nwill be reported by r the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign tasked with evaluating the \nCME project. These reports will be used to assess the impact of the pilot as it continues to be \nimplemented and before the final evaluation is completed.    \n    h.  CME Pilot Time Frames and Capacity \nThe CME pilot started in February 2014 and is currently scheduled to last for three years.  \nThe pilot is designed to serve approximately 200 children annually and 600 during the course of \nthe three year pilot.  The daily census as of approximately September 9, 2016, is 150, and a total \nof 310 children have been served in the pilot since February 2014.  \nLessons learned from the two years of the CME pilot have been applied to the \ndevelopment of the immersion sites as set forth in Recommendation #2.  See discussion infra at \npp. 25-38.  Through the CME pilot, DCFS has begun to localize processes within the regional \nstructure of the CME allowing more local control and further empowering CFTs to make \ndecisions regarding the best services and placement types for children.  For example, the Clinical \nIntervention for Placement Preservation (CIPP) has been eliminated for children enrolled in the \nCME and the centralized process for placing children in substitute care (Central Matching) is \nbeing replaced.  DCFS is committed to continuing the process of reinforcing local control of \nvarious policies and processes, since this local integration has been shown to be effective in the \nCME pilot.  \nIn addition, DCFS recognizes that any system change processes, such as those undertaken \nin the CME pilot, must have strong administrative oversight and support.  Because changing the \nculture of a system requires consistent messaging, over time, a single administrator of the \nprogram with direct access to executive leadership was established. This administrative structure \nhas allowed policy, procedural and other system barriers to be addressed in the pilot helping to \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 22 of 60 PageID #:1018\n \npropel culture change. This also ensures that both DCFS and private agency staff are held \naccountable for honoring the CFT model integral to the pilot, which represents a completely new \nway of doing business.  \n    i.  CME Evaluation \n  The Psychology Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be \nperforming a full evaluation of the CME pilot project.  DCFS and the University of Illinois are \ncompleting a data sharing agreement.  The current plan for the evaluation includes identification \nof a comparison group by the end of December 2016 and the completion of an interim evaluation \nby March 2017.  A full evaluation of the efficacy of the pilot will be completed after the full \nthree years period of the pilot has been completed in 2017.    \n  3.  Dually-Involved Youth Pilots   \n \nDually-involved youth are involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems \nsimultaneously. These youth face complicated challenges and generally require a more intense \narray of services and supports than other youth known to each system individually.  There is \nlittle cross-systems collaboration between the child welfare and the juvenile justice systems.  \nTo address the unique challenges of this population, DCFS initiated two separate pilots to \ndetermine the most effective strategies for attaining better outcomes for these youth. The \nRegenerations pilot provides intensive placement finding with additional supportive services to \nmove children out of detention as soon as possible. The Pay for Success pilot is funded by \nprivate dollars and offers intensive care coordination through a fidelity wraparound process to \ndually involved youth.  Both pilots are running simultaneously to determine which model \nproduces the best outcomes for dually-involved youth.  The pilots are described in more detail \nbelow.    \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 23 of 60 PageID #:1019\n \n    a.  Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved Youth at Cook  \n      County Juvenile Detention Center  \n \nDCFS engaged Dr. Alan Morris and Deann Muehlbauer, from the University of Illinois \nat Chicago Behavioral Health Program to review and assess the DCFS system, placement \nresources and the current system for matching and placing youth in residential treatment \nfacilities in response to the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce the Consent Decree.  This review \nidentified a high-risk population of youth who remain in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary \nDetention Center (JTDC) for long periods of time after their release date and who are often \nplaced directly from JTDC into residential treatment facilities, where they remain for long \nperiods of time.  Exhibit Q, JTDC RUR/Regenerations Pilot Presentation.  The consultants \nfurther determined that this population of youth and families were often difficult to engage and \nresistant to services, presented complex mental health and behavioral challenges and exhibited \nhigh levels of environmental stress.  The Regenerations/RUR pilot (Release Upon Request) \nwas initiated to address these long stays of youth at the JTDC by developing additional \nplacement and resources for this population.  In order to support the Regenerations process \nDCFS has contracted with ChildServ and National Youth Alternatives Program to develop \nmore foster homes for dually involved youth.  \n     i.  Theory of Change  \nThe theory of change developed for the Regenerations RUR project is that services \nprovided under a wraparound philosophy result in better outcomes for youth being released \nfrom detention, including placements in less restrictive settings than residential treatment \nfacilities.  The wraparound services include intensive care coordination, family and youth peer \nsupport services, intensive in-home services, respite care, mobile crisis response and \nstabilization and use of flexible funds.  Federal research supports this theory of change.  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 24 of 60 PageID #:1020\n \n   The implementation of the Regenerations pilot is set forth in the Logic Model attached \nas Exhibit R.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the Logic Model is attached as \nExhibit S.     \n      ii.  Pilot Overview  \n \nThe Regenerations/RUR (Release Upon Request) pilot began July 6, 2015, and serves \nyouth ages 12 - 18 years old who are 1) in the custody of DCFS, 2) are detained in the Cook \nCounty Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), and 3) have been determined by a judge \nto be ready for release (RUR).  Based upon the evaluation of dual ward detention data in \nprevious years, the pilot was developed to serve a total of 65 youth, and 56 youth are currently \nenrolled.  Youth in this pilot receive specialized services including intensive mentoring services \nand priority placement in home and community settings.   \n Upon the notification from the courts that a youth is eligible for RUR, DCFS Legal \nnotifies a DCFS Child Protection Supervisor and the Regenerations pilot program manager to \nopen the case.  Regenerations pilot staff interview the youth within 24 hours of notification.  \nImmediately upon assignment to the Regenerations pilot, an assessment is initiated to identify \nthe youth’s strengths and needs, while still detained at JTDC.  Family and court-appointed \nstakeholders also are engaged in this assessment.  Shortly after the initial assessment begins, a \nCIPP meeting is held at JTDC to establish a Child and Family Team (CFT), which is led by the \nRegenerations staff assigned to the case and includes a CIPP Facilitator.  The CIPP Facilitator \ncompletes the Child and Adolescent Service Intensity Instrument (CASII) to document the \nyouth’s service intensity level.  The CFT utilizes the CASII to develop an Individualized Service \nPlan that identifies the services required to support the youth’s strengths and needs. The \nIndividualized Service Plan is completed within 30 days.  \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 25 of 60 PageID #:1021\n \nAt least quarterly, continued CFTs take place to provide care coordination, assuring the \nIndividualized Service Plan is implemented according to the youth’s case plan action steps and \ntimeframes for implementing those steps.  The plan includes additional services such as \ncomprehensive mental health assessment, mentoring and advocacy services at a minimum 7 ½ to \n30 hours a week, program-funded employment, crisis intervention, and flexible funding to meet \nthe needs of individualized youth.   \n      iii.  Evaluation \n        Chapin Hall anticipates finalizing its evaluation for the Regenerations Pilot by late 2017 \nor early 2018, with periodic interim evaluations.  The key outcome measures will focus on the \nreduction in the days youth are detained in the JTDC beyond their release date, increase in the \nnumber of youth released directly to home and community-based settings, increase in the \nprovision of needed community-based behavioral health services, and child welfare support \nservices resulting in a reduction in the days youth reside in a residential placment.     \n      iv.  DCFS Leadership \n  This project is being led by Pete Digre, Deputy Director of Placement and Community \nServices.  The Project Manager for this pilot is Elizabeth Kling, Associate Deputy Director, \nJuvenile Justice and Pilot Programs.   \n  b.  Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually Involved Youth  \nIn September 2013, the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget announced a \nrequest for proposals (RFP) for Social Impact Bonds to spur better outcomes for Illinois \nyouth.  The RFP focused on two specific areas:  1) increasing placement stability and \nreducing re-arrests for youth in DCFS legal custody with histories of justice involvement; \nand 2) improving educational achievements and living wage employment opportunities for \njustice involved youth most likely to reoffend upon return to their communities.  Exhibit T, \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 26 of 60 PageID #:1022\n \nPress Release on Social Impact Bonds.  The Social Impact Bond model is premised on \ngovernment agencies teaming up with service providers and private sector investors to \ncreate and fund innovative social programs.  Private sector investors provide start-up funds \nand then get re-paid when the programs reach specific outcome targets.  Social Impact \nBonds are designed to create innovative evidence based solutions to address social issues \nwhile at the same time limiting risks to tax payers.   In May 2014, the Conscience \nCommunity Network, LLC (CCN) was selected through the RFP process to develop a Pay \nfor Success project for dually involved youth in Illinois.  Exhibit U, Illinois Dually-Involved \nYouth Pay for Success Initiative Ramp-Up Fact Sheet.   \n      i.   Theory of Change \n  The theory of change for the Pay for Success Pilot is premised on the belief that many \nyouth in the juvenile justice system get involved in the child welfare system due to the \nbreakdown of family and community services.  Extensive collaboration with the multitude of \nsystems in which the families of these youth are involved, and development of support \nsystems for these youth and families through a wraparound approach, will return the youth \nto a more healthy community and family support system.  \nThe implementation of the Pay for Success for dually involved youth pilot is set forth in \nthe Logic Model, attached as Exhibit V.  A status report, which adheres to the structure of the \nLogic Model, is attached as Exhibit W.     \n    ii.  Overview \nThe Pay for Success pilot will serve dually-involved youth who are not in Regenerations. \nThis pilot utilizes the Crossover Youth Practice Model (CYPM), developed by the Georgetown \nUniversity McCourt School of Public Policy – Center for Juvenile Justice Reform.  This pilot \nwill provide intensive care coordination through a fidelity wraparound model that will ensure \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 27 of 60 PageID #:1023\n \nyouth have access to evidence-based, community-based and non-traditional treatments and \nsupports that address the individual’s and family’s behavioral health needs.   \nYouth aged 11 to 17 who are in DCFS legal custody who are arrested for a crime or \nyouth who are in the juvenile justice system and placed into the legal custody of DCFS are \neligible for the pilot.  When a youth is assigned to the Pay for Success pilot, a Wraparound \nFacilitator will coordinate the CFT process, which includes a thorough and joint assessment of \nthe youth’s strengths and needs and the development of a service plan within 30 days.  In \naddition, the pilot will provide access to evidence-based services through a network of home and \ncommunity-based service providers along with flexible funds that will be utilized to fund \nspecialized services when needed.   The Wraparound Facilitator will also support the \npermanency worker by identifying resources, sharing information, and connecting youth to non-\ntraditional programming.   \nThe pilot will support collaboration between governmental systems to rapidly identify \nissues, engage in case coordination, and provide increased access to therapeutic programs. The \nramp-up phase of the pilot began January 2016 with children from Cook and Lake Counties. \nThere was a significant period of negotiation regarding contract terms, which has been recently \nbeen resolved.  It is anticipated that the pilot will commence in Cook, Lake, Jefferson and \nFranklin counties shortly after September 1, 2016. The current plan calls for the identification \nand start up in three additional counties during the next six months.  \n    iii.  Service Array \nYouth enrolled in the Pay for Success pilot will have access to the following services: \nfunctional family therapy; multi-systemic therapy; brief strategic family therapy; Attachment, \nRegulation and Competency (ARC); Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to \nChronic Stress (SPARCS); academic supports; counseling/therapy; recreational activities; \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 28 of 60 PageID #:1024\n \nsubstance abuse treatment; workforce development; and other services that will benefit the \nyouth’s functioning.  Some youth will be placed in Treatment Foster Care – Oregon foster \nhomes.  \n      iv.  Pay for Success Payment Structure and Evaluation  \nThe Pay for Success project is funded through a social impact bond that is supported by \nprivate investors, philanthropies and foundations. The private funds will be used to pay for the \npilot services ensuring that DCFS has no fiscal investment in the project while the project is in \noperation.  DCFS only pays if it is clearly demonstrated that the services that were provided had \na statistically significant impact on the outcomes of the youth that are enrolled in the program.   \nThe evaluation is being designed by the University of Michigan School of Social Work \nand will include outcomes focused on the reduction in the number of days youth are placed in \nresidential facilities and an increase in home and community-based service capacity and \nprovision. \n      v.  DCFS Leadership of the Pay for Success Pilot  \n  Lee Annes, CIPP and D-CIPP Statewide Administrator, is the DCFS Project Manager for \nthe Pay for Success project. The Strategic Planning and Innovation Division liaison for this pilot \nis Kristine Herman.  \n  B.  Panel Recommendation #2: Engage Department offices in a staged  \n  ‘immersion’ process of retraining and coaching front-line staff in a cohesive    \n  model of practice that provides children and their families with access to a    \n  comprehensive array  of services, including intensive home-based services,    \n  designed to enable children to live with their families. \n \n  1.  Immersion Site Overview \n   \n  Immersion sites are test or pilot sites representing a small geographic area where youth, \nbirth parents, foster parents, DCFS staff, private agency staff and multiple other stakeholders \nwork together to fully build and implement a “core practice model” of child welfare practice that \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 29 of 60 PageID #:1025\n \nputs children and families at the center of service planning and builds community and home \nbased resources to service children and families.  DCFS will use the immersion site process as \nthe center of its transformation in order to achieve better outcomes for safety, permanency and \nstability for Illinois families.  \n  The immersion site process will incorporate a number of key components.  Central to the \nimmersion site process is extensive training and coaching of all DCFS and private agency staff in \nthe new “core practice model,” which is comprised of the Family Centered, Trauma Informed \nand Strength Based (FTS) training for all staff and the Model of Supervisory Practice (MoSP) \ntraining and coaching model for all supervisors.   The centerpiece of the core practice model is \nparental engagement and child and family team meetings.  \n  DCFS will also integrate its Quality Assurance Division and Monitoring Division in the \nimmersion site development.  The Quality Assurance and Monitoring Divisions will implement a \nQuality Service Review Process (QSR), with the input and guidance of Paul Vincent and the \nChild Welfare Group, for a variety of activities in the immersion site.  One aspect of the Quality \nService Review process will be to ensure establishment of the FTS and MoSP model, focusing \non the establishment of parental engagement and child and family team meetings.  \n  Another key piece of the immersion site process is the development of community and \nhome based services for children and families.  These services will be developed on a local level \nwith the input of key stakeholders.  DCFS will also develop a system for of flexible funding so \nany services that are needed to achieve permanency and assist families can be purchased quickly \nand on a local level. \n  DCFS will engage in a number of structural changes to improve the overall child welfare \nsystem.  These changes include improving case flow and day to day operational process by \nreviewing and revising rules, policies, practice and operational procedures which are ineffective, \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 30 of 60 PageID #:1026\n \nredundant and hinder achievement of permanency for children and youth. The DCFS \norganizational structure will also be revamped to increase integration and decentralize various \nfunctions.  In particular, DCFS will modify some current central office functions such as \nmatching children with placements (Central Matching) and case opening (Case Assignment and \nPlacement Unit) to determine if efficiencies can be achieve through local management.  DCFS \nintends to reorganize the DCFS field office structure around Judicial Circuits to better align its \noperations with the Juvenile Court. \n    a.  Theory of Change  \n  The theory of change underlying the immersion sites is that the enhancements to training \nfor all casework staff and coaching for supervisors coupled with a quality service review process \nwill improve casework practice.  The improvements in casework practice will assist in the \ndevelopment of services that are family centered and individualized, which will result in \nimproved outcomes in terms of safety, stability, and permanency. A logic model is attached as \nExhibit X.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as \nExhibit Y.     \n    b.  Identification of Immersion Sites  \nIn August 2016, DCFS began the immersion site process in the four initial sites.  The four \ninitial immersion sites include:  (1) Lake County, (2) St. Clair County, (3) the Rock Island area, \nincluding Rock Island, Whiteside, Mercer and Henry counties, and (4) the five counties in the \nMount Vernon area, including Clay, Hamilton, Jefferson, Marion and Wayne Counties.  At the \nurging of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, DCFS agreed to realign the territory of \nits Rock Island field office so that Whiteside County, the only county in the Fourth Judicial \nCircuit not part of the original selection, would be included in the immersion site.  Recognizing \nthe importance of the court system to the success of the immersion sites, the Director made the \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 31 of 60 PageID #:1027\n \ndecision to realign the DCFS boundaries.  DCFS is in the process of assessing DCFS office \ncoverage areas in relation to judicial circuit areas as they do not currently align.  The initial \nimmersion sites encompass approximately 11% of children and youth in care.   \nIt is expected to take approximately one year to complete the process in the first four \nimmersion sites. This timeline has been intentionally extended beyond that first anticipated, \nbased on feedback and advice from the immersion site consultants Paul Vincent and Narell \nJoyner.  \nAdditional immersion sites will be rolled-out on a regular basis.  The current goal is to \ncomplete the immersion site process in the entire state by 2019.   \n  c.  Immersion Site Activities  \nAfter identifying the first four immersion sites, DCFS established Immersion Site \nDirector positions in each of the four sites.   Candidates for those positions were interviewed and \nare in the final selection process.   \n  DCFS designed an outcome data tracking system that will allow DCFS to track \ninformation for an immersion site and for comparison sites. Key elements of the design of the \ndata set to be tracked include the following. Other data sets will be developed with the experts \nduring the project. \na.  Historical trend lines for proximal and distal outcomes; \nb.  Tracking outputs and proximal and distal outcomes for both Immersion and \nComparison sites as well as statewide; \nc.  Alerts when the stability of the placement for the following cohorts of youth has \nbeen disrupted: \ni.  Youth who have been in shelter over 30 days; \nii.  Youth who have been stepped down from residential care; \niii.  Youth who have stayed in a psychiatric hospital beyond medical necessity; \niv.  Youth who have stayed in detention beyond their release upon request \ndate. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 32 of 60 PageID #:1028\n \nDCFS leadership staff held listening visits in the four initial immersion sites.2  The \nlistening visits were conducted with DCFS leadership staff from both the Director’s office and \nthe local regional office, DCFS front line personnel, judges currently sitting in Juvenile Court in \neach immersion site, other key court personnel, such as State’s Attorneys and guardians ad litem, \nprivate agency staff, counseling and other service providers, children and youth in care, birth \nparents and foster parents.   \nDCFS began initial steps toward decentralizing various programmatic pieces.  A pilot \nwas established for regionalization of the matching process for placements for children and \nyouth and for the case opening process in the Southern region.  This includes the immersion sites \nof Mount Vernon and East St. Louis.   \n  2.  Description of Family-Centered, Trauma-Informed, Strength-Based    \n    (FTS) Practice Model     \n \nThe FTS component of the Core Practice Model sets forth clear guidelines for \ncaseworkers and supervisors that establish a more effective process of family engagement, \nassessment and case planning.  The FTS trains caseworkers to engage with youth and families in \na continuous, rather than episodic, manner that ensures open, honest, and culturally-aware \ncommunication with children and families.  This level of engagement requires seeking out and \nlistening to the opinions and goals of the children and families, respecting and implementing \ntheir suggestions whenever possible, and providing them with essential information and \neducation in a respectful and understandable way.  \n  a.  Theory of Change  \n                                                 \n2 DCFS held the initial listening visit in Mount Vernon on August 3 and 4, 2016.  A listening visit was held on August 9, \n2016 in East St. Louis, August 18, 2016 in Rock Island and August 24, 2016 in Lake County.  DCFS will be returning to \nSt. Clair County in mid-September and will return later in September to meet with additional stakeholders in the Mt. \nVernon area.   \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 33 of 60 PageID #:1029\n \nThe theory of change developed for the FTS training model is that Illinois needs a core \npractice model that shapes the way that all persons within the system will work with the children \nand families served.  Implementation of the FTS practice model will provide practical guidance \non the behaviors needed to engage with families and partner with stakeholders in an effort to \nincrease child safety, permanency, and well-being.  Adoption and implementation of the FTS \nCore Practice Model across the child welfare system will require time, resources, system \npatience, risk tolerance, support at all levels and the involvement of parents, families and youth \nin partnership with purchase of service agencies, judicial, community stakeholder, and other state \nagencies to fully achieves the desired outcomes for safety, permanence, and wellbeing.  \nKey components of the FTS training model include:  Child and Family Teams, individualized \ncase and service planning, development of pathways to permanency and methods to address \nissues of disproportionality and disparity in the child welfare system. A logic model is attached \nas Exhibit Z.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as \nExhibit AA.     \n  b.  Child and Family Teams   \nA major component of the FTS model is that caseworkers must establish and facilitate \nChild and Family Teams (CFT) that plan and coordinate interventions. The child’s permanency \nworker will be responsible for facilitation of the CFT, which includes the child, the family, any \nnatural supports identified by the family and all providers of services to the child and family.  \nThe CFT is responsible for assessment, case planning and monitoring progress of permanency \ngoals.  The FTS model establishes accountability of everyone involved, because it requires a \ncontinuous review of the plans and responsibility for implementation.  The FTS model requires \nthat children and families are treated as full partners in assessment, planning, intervention, \nreview, evaluation and decision-making.  FTS also requires caseworkers to collaborate with all \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 34 of 60 PageID #:1030\n \nindividuals who are involved with a child and family in the planning, delivery, coordination and \nmanagement of services.    \n  c.   Individualized Case/Service Planning  \n FTS provides guidance to ensure that all assessment and planning is backed by clearly \nidentified goals that are measured, reviewed and revised to meet children and families’ changing \nneeds and strengths. The training will focus on developing individualized plans that include \ndeliberate action steps and identify specific individuals responsible for implementing each step.  \nCaseworkers will better understand that all plans must set forth meaningful and well-articulated \ntimeframes. Relevant action steps are reviewed regularly by the permanency worker with the \nCFT (e.g., a minimum of every three months) to evaluate the feasibility of existing goals and \nappropriateness of services as the youth progresses.   \n  d.  Safe and Sustained Transition to Permanence  \nFTS focuses on early and meaningful engagement of the family to develop pathways to \npermanency.  FTS requires the identification and engagement of formal and natural supports to \nmaintain the child’s connections to their community, culture, relatives and fictive kin, which is \ncritical to ensuring that children transition to adulthood with a robust support network.   \n  e.  Disproportionality/Disparity in the Child Welfare System  \n Issues of disproportionality and disparity are also addressed by FTS. Disproportionality \nrelates to the under- or over-representation of a particular racial or ethnic group involved in child \nwelfare compared to their representation in the general U.S. population. Disparity refers to the \nunequal treatment of individuals across racial and ethnic groups.  FTS strives to reduce, if not \neliminate, disproportionality and disparity through the reform of permanency workers’ \nengagement practices. Under FTS, permanency workers and supervisors will be trained, coached \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 35 of 60 PageID #:1031\n \nand evaluated on their ability to interact with children and families in a continuous, open, honest, \nculturally-aware manner, with the aim of eliminating cultural biases.   \n  f.  Implementation of FTS in Immersion Sites  \nDCFS training staff, working with Paul Vincent and the Child Welfare Group, are \ndeveloping a training plan for all immersion sites.  The current plan includes training of direct \nservice staff, including permanency and intact staff, child protection staff, licensing staff and \nadoption staff.  Training staff is currently developing a training plan by role and specialty.  \n3.  Description of Model of Supervisory Practice \nThe Model of Supervisory Practice (MoSP) is the second component of the Core Practice \nModel. The MoSP trains supervisory staff to continuously coach the permanency worker through \nreflective supervision.  The MoSP clearly defines the duties and boundaries of supervisors, and \nfacilitates their ongoing learning of social work best practices. The training gives supervisors \nenhanced techniques for teaching staff the skills to engage families, facilitate CFTs, and develop \ncomprehensive assessments that lead to strengths-based, individualized case planning with clear \npathways to permanency.  \n  a.  Theory of Change  \nThe theory of change developed for the MoSP is that Illinois needs a model of supervisory \npractice that will shape the way supervisors within the system work with child welfare staff.  \nProvision of consistent quality supervision will support the application of the DCFS FTS Child \nWelfare Practice Model and will contribute to a supported and committed workforce that is able \nto deliver services to children aimed at achieving the outcomes of safety, permanency, and \nwellbeing.  Exhibit BB, MoSP Logic Model.  A status report which adheres to the structure of \nthe logic model is attached as Exhibit CC.     \n \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 36 of 60 PageID #:1032\n \n  b.  MoSP Overview  \nSupervisors will be trained to conduct case-specific supervision that includes: a brief \nhistorical summary of the case; the current level of engagement and any additional engagement \nstrategies that could be explored; current safety and risk factors or concerns; protective factors; \nfollow-up on previous case instruction; and a review of the child and family’s progress toward \nmeeting case planning goals, timeframes and supports in light of changing needs and strengths of \nthe child and family.   \nIn the event case planning goals have not been accomplished, the supervisor will be \ntrained to evaluate with staff why the plan was not successful; in retrospect, what specific steps \ncould have been taken earlier to achieve success; and, what specific changes to the plan are \nneeded to ensure the family’s success.   \n4.   Initiation of MoSP Training Model \nDCFS piloted the MoSP training curriculum from January 2016 until May 2016.  The \npiloted training included pre-engagement webinars and implementation surveys.  Classroom \nbased learning sessions were conducted between January and April 2016.  Additionally, \ncoaching and content reinforcement between the various learning sessions were provided to each \nparticipant with an emphasis on application of the MoSP content.  The four modules of the \nMoSP training were delivered over two days of in-person training over four months and there \nwas a minimum of 90-minute coaching sessions between each of the learning sessions.   \n5.  Core Practice Model Expert \nBecause the Core Practice Model represents a fundamental shift in casework and \nsupervisory practice in Illinois, DCFS has retained Paul Vincent, Director, The Child Welfare \nPolicy and Practice Group, as an expert to lead and direct the implementation of the model.  Mr. \nVincent, Narelle Joyner, and others from The Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group will \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 37 of 60 PageID #:1033\n \nassist DCFS with development of the curriculum, development and implementation of the \ntraining model, and training logistics at immersion sites.    \n6.  Statewide Summit \n  In October 2016, a statewide Summit will be held by DCFS and the Casey Family \nPrograms. The courts, contracted private agencies and other community stakeholders have been \nengaged in the planning and presentations. The Summit will include an announcement of the \nimplementation of the Core Practice Model and the immersion site process.  The Summit \nprovides an opportunity for all stakeholders to be introduced to the common language and \nprinciples of the Core Practice Model encouraging a sense of shared mission. The Summit will \ninclude participants from throughout DCFS and its private agency partners. It will also include \nrepresentatives from the judiciary, involved youth, families, members of the Illinois Children and \nFamily Services Advisory Council and members of CWAC committees, State’s Attorneys, \nGuardians ad Litem, Court Appointed Special Advocates, and public defenders. \n  7.  Quality Service Reviews   \n  An essential piece of the Core Practice model is the implementation of a Quality Service \nReview (QSR) process.   A QSR is a practice improvement approach designed to assess current \noutcomes and system performance by gathering information directly from families, children and \nservice team members.  DCFS, with the assistance of Paul Vincent and the Child Welfare Group, \nwill utilize an Illinois specific review protocol for the examination of FTS model of practice that \nincludes a model of supervision and the effective utilization of Child and Family Team meetings. \n    a.  Theory of Change  \n  The theory of change developed for the QSR process in immersion sites is premised on \nthe belief that staff who receive relevant information and coaching through the results of quality \nservice reviews, dashboards and data reports and also receive support and encouragement \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 38 of 60 PageID #:1034\n \nthrough teaming and utilization of an improvement cycle will begin to understand the benefits of \nimplementing data driven behavior and practice.  The improved behavior and practice should \nshow positive impacts on outcomes on children and families in Illinois.  A logic model is \nattached as Exhibit DD.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic model is \nattached as Exhibit EE.     \n    b.  Implementation of the QSR Process  \n  The first step in implementing the QSR process in the immersion sites is the development \nof the draft tool.  DCFS will begin a review of the draft review tool by October 15, 2016.  \nPersonnel from the Divisions of Quality Assurance, Training and Monitoring will be part of the \ndesign team for the QSR tool, working in conjunction with Paul Vincent and George Taylor from \nthe Child Welfare Group. The review tool will be finalized by the middle of November 2016.  \n  Once the QSR review tool is finalized, staff will be trained on the tool.  It is anticipated \nthat this training will be two days in length and will be completed by January 30, 2017.  DCFS \nintends to begin to pilot use of the QSR process by February 1, 2017. The initial pilot review will \nencompass a single immersion site, which permits any identified adjustments in the tool before \nuse in other immersion sites.  Mentors will be provided for each of the initial reviews.  Each \nreviewer will have at a least two week long mentoring experience and the mentors will be on site \nduring the initial reviews.  \n  8.  Development of Regional Capacity to Expand Service Array  \nWithin the immersion sites, DCFS will build sufficient capacity within the community to \nprovide services to meet the unique needs of the children and families.   DCFS has begun \ndiscussions with the federal Children’s Bureau regarding the development and enhancement of \nTitle IV-E waivers for out-of-home care funds to develop and build an intensive array of services \nin the immersion sties.  DCFS plans on finalizing the Title IV-E waiver in September 2016.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 39 of 60 PageID #:1035\n \nDCFS children and families may also require enhanced behavioral health services and \ninterventions to address concerns that are impeding permanency. DCFS will begin to offer these \nenhanced behavioral health services in the immersion sites by utilizing existing Intensive \nPlacement Stabilization (IPS) contracts. Currently, IPS contracts provide community-based, in-\nhome therapeutic interventions to children in traditional foster care who are experiencing trauma \nreactions, emotional and/or behavioral problems putting them at risk of losing their current \nplacement.  To enhance the availability of evidence-based/trauma-informed services, IPS has \nintegrated Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET), an \nevidence-based psycho-educational approach to treat trauma symptoms, into the available \nservice array.  \nWithin the immersion sites, DCFS will expand the availability of IPS programs and \nservices to DCFS children who are in psychiatric hospitals, residential placements, or group \nhome placements to assist in their transition to a less restrictive setting. DCFS also will use the \nexisting IPS contracts and providers to develop additional critically-needed behavioral health \nservices such as home-based services, family and youth peer support, crisis and non-crisis \nrespite, and evidence/trauma-informed services.  \n9.  Use and Oversight of Flexible Funds \nAs another avenue of ensuring that children and families receive needed supports and \nservices, immersion sites will incorporate the use of flexible funding as part of the Core Practice \nModel.  Flexible funds will allow permanency workers to respond to the unique needs of \nchildren and families by purchasing goods and services beyond what is available through \nexisting contractual services. Permanency workers and supervisors will be trained on appropriate \nservices and supports that can be purchased with flexible funding, as well as on mechanisms that \nensure the funds are readily available and monitored for appropriateness.  With the guidance of \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 40 of 60 PageID #:1036\n \nthe Core Practice Model expert, DCFS will establish time frames for the finalization of flexible \nfunding policies and procedures.  \nWithin the immersion sites, DCFS will access Medicaid reimbursed services whenever \npossible and to the extent available.  Flexible funds will be utilized to purchase non-Medicaid \nservices and to help support the development of new services that are not already available.  \n Within the immersion sites, where needed, DCFS will utilize flexible funding to develop \nand implement additional mental health services.  An example of those services that could be \ndeveloped and implemented with flexible funds include some of those services that have been \ndeveloped through the CME pilot, including enhanced mobile crisis response, crisis stabilizers, \ncrisis respite, therapeutic mentoring services, peer support and non-crisis respite care. With the \nunderstanding that DCFS is not the Illinois State Medicaid agency, the goal is for such services \nto be integrated by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (which is the \nIllinois State Medicaid agency) into the federally approved Medicaid service array. \n   10.  Evaluation  \nImplementation of the Core Practice Model will comprise both a process and outcomes-\nbased evaluation.  \nPrior to the implementation of the immersion site coaching and training, Chapin Hall will \ncomplete a statewide baseline analysis for all areas anticipated to be impacted by the Core \nPractice Model including: \n•  Web-based survey of DCFS and POS caseworkers and supervisors around \nknowledge, beliefs, and practices to assess congruence with the new practice \nmodel.  \n \n•  Surveys of parents (in-home and permanency planning cases) to assess their \nstrengths and needs as well as their experience of their caseworker and services \nthey receive through DCFS. Sample sizes within immersion sites to provide \nestimates that are accurate enough to allow for comparison to later assessments at \nthe immersion site level.  \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 41 of 60 PageID #:1037\n \n \n•  Assessment of children’s functioning, and, for age-appropriate youth, their \nexperience of their caseworker and services they receive through DCFS, through \nmeasures used to audit CANS going forward (i.e., from independent sources such \nas caregivers, teachers, and children). Sample sizes within immersion sites to \nprovide estimates that are accurate enough to allow for comparison to later \nassessments at the immersion site level. \n \nOnce the Core Practice Model is implemented at immersion sites, Chapin Hall will \nevaluate DCFS’s and provider staff’s fidelity to the Core Practice Model, utilizing audits of \nimmersion sites that measure staff adherence to the model through assessments of staff \nengagement, assessment, and case planning with children and families.  Chapin Hall assessments \nwill include reviews of individual children’s files, interviews of children and families, and \ninterviews of DCFS and provider staff.  In addition, Chapin Hall will evaluate outcomes for \nchildren and families based on the implementation of the Core Practice Model.  Against \nestablished baselines for each immersion site, Chapin Hall will evaluate children’s absence of \nmaltreatment, placement stability, permanency, foster care re-entry, and wellbeing as defined by \nthe overarching metrics outlined in Section I above. \n  C.  Panel Recommendation #3:  “Fund a set of permanency planning    \n  initiatives to improve permanency outcomes for adolescents who enter state    \n  custody at age 12 or older either by transitioning youth to permanent homes or   \n  preparing them for reconnecting to their birth families reaching adulthood.”  \n \n  Youth over the age of 12 require additional services and assistance to achieve \npermanency so they do not age out of the system without substantial relationships and \ncommunity-based supports.  DCFS is focusing on this population through statutory, policy and \npractice initiatives.  Specifically, DCFS is expanding age eligibility for state-funded \nguardianship regardless of Title IV-E eligibility, and DCFS is expanding the definition of ‘fictive \nkin’ to include current foster parents.    Finally, DCFS is strengthening its family findings \ninitiatives to enhance family relationships for all children and youth in care.    \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 42 of 60 PageID #:1038\n \n  1.  State-funded guardianship assistance should be extended to all children aged \n    12 and older regardless of IV-E eligibility. \n \nOn August 24, 2016, the Department issued Policy Guide 2016.09, which changed the \neligibility criteria for state funded guardianship.  Exhibit FF.  Children who are 12 years and \nolder and who are placed with a licensed or unlicensed relative are now eligible for the state \nfunded option of subsidized guardianship. DCFS will engage in formal rulemaking to revise \nDCFS Rule 302.410 which should be completed by December 2016.  \n  a.  Theory of Change  \n  The theory of change for the implementation of revised criteria for state-funded \nguardianship is premised on the evidence that by lowering the age for youth eligible for state  \nfunded guardianship, more youth may find permanency with relatives and the opportunity for \nyouth to return to their family of origin may be enhanced.  The results of lowering the age of \neligible youth to 12 years of age will improve options for permanency and lead to improved \nwell-being.  A logic model is attached as Exhibit GG.  A status report which adheres to the \nstructure of the logic model is attached as Exhibit HH.     \n  2.  The definition of kin should be revised to include the current foster parent of \n    a child who has established a significant and family-like relationship with the \n    child, whether related or unrelated by birth or marriage. \n \nEffective January 1, 2015, the Children and Family Services Act was amended to expand \nthe definition of “relative” for placement purposes to include fictive kin.  Fictive kin “means any \nindividual, unrelated by birth or marriage, who is shown to have close personal or emotional ties \nwith the child or the child’s family prior to the child’s placement with the individual.”  20 ILCS \n505/7 (emphasis added).   On August 19, 2016, Governor Rauner signed House Bill 5551 which \nfurther expands the definition of fictive kin to include “any individual, unrelated by birth or \nmarriage, who is the current foster parent of a child in the custody or guardianship of the \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 43 of 60 PageID #:1039\n \nDepartment . . . if the child has been in the home for at least one year and has established a \nsignificant  and family-like relationship with the foster parent has been identified by the \nDepartment as the child’s permanent connection, as defined by Department rule.”   P.A. 99-\n0836.  The effective date of this statute is January 1, 2017 and DCFS is in the process of \nupdating its administrative rules.  \n  3.  Both changes will result in a savings since the administrative savings are well \n    above the state costs for guardianship assistance payments and revision to  \n    the definition of kin will qualify more assistance payments for IV-E    \n    reimbursement. \n \nAfter the above-described rules are amended, many current foster parents will qualify for \nKinGap, a federally-funded reimbursement program for guardians.  The foregoing rule changes \nthus should enhance the flexibility of foster parents to move from traditional foster care to \nsubsidized guardianship. Conservative estimates indicate that 85 youth who are between ages 12 \nto 14 would be eligible for subsidized guardianship as a permanency option.  This expansion \nwould save DCFS an estimated $600,000 a year.   \n  4.  Implement specific “family finder” strategies as part of permanency    \n    planning for adolescents who do not have an obvious reunification plan. \n \nThe 2008 federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions \n \nAct sought to promote additional permanency options for children in care by funding grants to \nlocate relatives and requiring agencies to provide notice to relatives when children enter foster \ncare.  DCFS received a five year grant for intensive family finding services called Illinois \nRecruitment and Kin Connection Project – Getting Connected, Staying Connected.  The grant \nwas awarded in October, 2010 and ended September, 2015.  The project provided intensive \nfront-end family finding services in urban Cook County and suburban Will County for \nchildren ages six through 13 entering the child welfare system for the first time in order to \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 44 of 60 PageID #:1040\n \nimprove permanency options.3   Illinois Recruitment and Kin Connection Project, Final \nReport: Executive Summary, attached as Exhibit II.  \n  The program focused on identifying maternal and paternal family members and fictive \nkin immediately after custody was granted to DCFS. A Kin Connection Specialist was assigned \nto the case immediately after the granting of temporary custody and sought to locate family \nmembers who could participate in service planning and serve as a resource for placement, be a \nback-up placement, host sibling visits, host parent visits and act as a mentor for the family. \n  The theory of change for the Family Finding program is premised on the belief that \nrelatives will step up to care for their own family and that parents can be empowered to engage \nin the placement process by identifying relatives and fictive kin as placement options.  These \nchanges will lead to improved permanency for youth in care.  A logic model is attached as \nExhibit JJ.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as \nExhibit KK.     \n  DCFS will revise its rule and procedures to enhance family findings efforts on all levels.  \nFamily finding efforts will be conducted for all children and youth entering care with a return \nhome goal.  The revised rules and procedures will require all child protection, intact and-\npermanency staff to seek out non-custodial parents, relatives and fictive kin when placing a child \nor youth.  These individuals will be identified to serve not just as placement options, but also as \nindividuals to provide support to the family during their involvement with the Department. \nDCFS Permanency Achievement Specialists within each DCFS region will conduct family \nfinding tasks. Permanency Achievement Specialists will also be available to both DCFS and \nprivate agency staff to provide technical assistance on complex or difficult cases to identify \n                                                 \n3 At the request of DCFS personnel, the project was expanded to Kankakee and Grundy counties.   \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 45 of 60 PageID #:1041\n \nbarriers to permanency through methods of file mining, family meetings, trainings or other \nassistance.  Trainings on family findings will be provided to DCFS staff and private agency staff \nand administrators.  \nAdditionally, Administrative Case Review staff will flag cases where family finding is \nnot occurring or where there is a barrier to permanency so that DCFS and private agency staff \ncan be made aware of the issues and take steps to rectify the problems. In 2015, DCFS revised \nProcedures 315, Permanency Planning, to include and highlight new family finding strategies \nthat must begin early and continue throughout the life of every child’s case. The amended \nprocedures require caseworkers to speak with children and youth throughout the life of the case \nto identify relatives and other individuals with whom they have a connection.  The amended \nprocedures also formalize family findings issues as part of the ACR process. ACR staff will flag \na case when it is determined that  staff  have not taken the necessary steps to locate and engage \nfamily and fictive kin and alerts will be sent to the caseworker  supervisor and DCFS or Purchase \nof Service manager.   http://www.nrcpfc.org/downloads/SixSteps.pdf.  In order to expedite \npermanency DCFS has automated the family finding forms and tools as a step toward achieving \nthese permanency goals.  Training on Procedure 315 of all DCFS and POS permanency staff \nbegan in February 2016.  Based upon feedback from the initial training cohort, the training is \ncurrently being revised and will continue upon finalization.   \nD.  Panel Recommendation #4:  “Retain an organizational consultant to aid the  \n  Department in “rebooting” a number of stalled initiatives that are intended to    \n  address the needs of children and youth with psychological, behavioral or    \n  emotional challenges.” \n \n1.  Reorganization, Strategic Planning and Cultural Change  \n \n•  To oversee implementation of this plan, the Department should create a high level \nunit with cross-organization authority to develop an implementation plan, \nmanage the implementation and resolve system barriers \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 46 of 60 PageID #:1042\n \n•  The consultant should evaluate the organizational structure and culture of \nDCFS; the effectiveness of DCFS’ policies, procedures and programs; the \neffectiveness of the Department’s leadership and managerial structure and \nfunction and to assess the supervisory functions of the agency.  \n \nDirector Sheldon obtained approval for a departmental reorganization of leadership and \nmanagerial structure from the Illinois Civil Service Commission. The final organization structure \nwas implemented in October 2015.  See DCFS Organizational Structure, attached as Exhibit LL.  \nAs part of the process of reorganization and structural change, the Director formed the Strategic \nPlanning and Innovation Division (“Strategic Planning”) in September 2015. This division works \nwith Pete Digre and focusses on driving the implementation of innovation for DCFS.  Strategic \nPlanning will ensure that DCFS does not take a siloed approach to initiatives.  Strategic Planning \nhas cross-divisional authority and has responsibility for reform, including the B.H. \nImplementation Plan.  \nThe Strategic Planning Division, in conjunction with Pete Digre, is expanding to include \nboth internal and external experts to guide initiatives and act as liaisons to the projects, \nstakeholders and DCFS divisions. The division will partner with DCFS leadership and staff, POS \nproviders, and other external stakeholders to support and drive consistent progress toward the \ngoals envisioned in this Plan.  Pete Digre, Strategic Planning, and Project Managers will meet \nweekly and report to during bi-weekly supervision meetings.  Project Managers will support and \ncollect reports from each university or external partner at least quarterly as well as ensure \ncompliance with the four-month implementation plan status reports. Project Managers are \nresponsible for tracking data and outcomes for each initiative and for supporting consistent \nevaluation of success, progress and lessons learned in conjunction with the contracted expert \nsupport and other members of the Strategic Planning team.   \n \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 47 of 60 PageID #:1043\n \n2.  Full Implementation of Designed Initiatives  \n•  Development of new programs and retention of existing initiatives in DCFS \nshould be done after determining how it fits in with the DCFS core mission, after \na thorough review of other programs that may already be in existence to address \nthe problem or need driving the new initiative, and that duplicate services and \ninitiatives already in place be eliminated or revised to prevent inefficient use of \nresources. Mechanisms must be enacted to make effective programs and policies \nbe self-sustaining such as through changing reimbursement strategies or revising \njob descriptions. \n \n•  Full implementation of several excellently designed initiatives, including among \nothers: the Illinois Birth thru Three Demonstration, Integrated Assessment, \nResidential Services Performance-Based Contracting, DCFS Monitoring of \nResidential Services, and Home-Based Mental Health Services, is being stalled \nor undermined by a variety of systemic and external factors, such as lengthy \ncourt delays to adjudication, categorical funding restrictions, challenges of client \nengagement, inflexible bureaucratic rules, and discontinuities in the handoff of \ncase management responsibilities among public and private agencies. \n \nDCFS has multiple initiatives in progress across the state.  The Strategic Planning \nDivision has been put into place to help drive those initiatives, assess barriers, and track \noutcomes so that staff can update the program plans quickly to determine if strategies are \nproductive.  The Expert Panel mentions numerous specific initiatives that are currently \ndesignated as stalled, many of which are addressed in other areas of this report. \nThe initiatives including Integrated Assessment (Recommendation #2), Residential \nServices Performance-Based Contracting (Recommendation #6), DCFS Monitoring of \nResidential Services (Recommendation #6), and Home Based Mental Health Services \n(Recommendation #1) are discussed in the other sections of this plan. The additional stalled \ninitiatives, Illinois Birth thru Three Demonstration Project and SAFE Families for Children, are \ndetailed below.  Barriers to successful implementation of both of these initiatives persist.  \n    a.  Illinois Birth Thru Three Demonstration Project \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 48 of 60 PageID #:1044\n \nDCFS was awarded a five year demonstration project in 2012 which targets caregivers \nand their children aged birth through three years of age who enter foster care through out-of- \nhome placements regardless of Title IV-E eligibility in Cook County.  These children are \nprovided one of two evidence-based interventions, Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), a \ndyadic therapeutic intervention for children ages 0 to 5 who have experienced on or more \ntraumatic events and experience behavior, attachment or other mental health problems, and/or \nNurturing Parenting Program (NPP), a curriculum based psycho-educational and cognitive \nbehavioral group intervention that modifies maladaptive beliefs which contribute to abuse \nparenting,  in an effort to improve attachment, reduce trauma symptoms, prevent foster care re-\nentry, improve child wellbeing and increase permanency. \nThe project identifies children ages 0 to 3 years of age entering foster care in Cook \nCounty.  Following random assignment of the child’s case to DCFS regions and foster care \nagencies, children are referred on a rotational basis to receive developmental screenings by \nearly childhood developmental specialists and are selected for the interventions based on those \nscreenings. Children assessed as high risk are referred immediately to CPP.  Biological parents \nparticipate in NPP.   A unique feature of the project is the comprehensive assessment of trauma \nand risk for children within the targeted age group. The IB3 assessment protocol requires \nclinicians to consider the trauma experiences of the child in relation to the needs of the \ncaregiver. \n  The theory of change is predicated on the assumption that improvements in parenting \ncompetencies will enhance early brain development in infants and children and provide a \nresponsive parenting environment that will allow children to be returned to their parents. A logic \nmodel is attached as Exhibit MM.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic \nmodel is attached as Exhibit NN.     \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 49 of 60 PageID #:1045\n \n    i.  Current Status  \nThis demonstration project has completed year three of full implementation.  Strategies \nand approaches to address the issues and challenges with engagement of foster parents in NPP \n(e.g. NPP Alumni Orientation, working with agency licensing staff, arranging for child care \nduring class participation time) have resulted in increased participation.  Engagement of foster \nparents continues to be a focus and in addition to orientation sessions and home outreach, the \ncurrent plan includes focusing on day care supports for foster parents to increase engagement.   \nAlthough implementation challenges still exist, the intervention group demonstrates a \nstatistically significant difference in permanency outcomes.  While both CPP and NPP have \nprogress to report, known challenges include:  \n•  CPP continues to experience a waiting list for clients in need of services. For \nexample, fee-for-service contracts do not allow for billing for the intensive \nengagement work required to get families involved in treatment and, as a result, \nproviders are struggling.  \n \n•  Challenges in engaging foster parents also exist.  As the pilot shifts additional \nresponsibility to the caregivers, additional foster parent training and supports are \nneeded.  \n \nThe Strategic Planning and Innovations Division will drive progress in overcoming the \nbarriers discussed.  Kristine Herman will be the Strategic Planning and Innovations Liaison. The \noperations lead for this project is Kimberly Mann, Project Director for the IB3 Title IV-E \nWaiver. \n  b.  SAFE Families for Children \nSafe Families for Children (SFFC) is a nationwide program that recruits and oversees a \nvoluntary network of host families where parents can safely place their children in a time of \nneed.   The program is designed to create an extended family- like support system for parents \nand provides a safe place for children while parents stabilize and get back on their feet, and \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 50 of 60 PageID #:1046\n \nmay prevent a child from coming into foster care.  The core objectives of SFFC include child \nwelfare deflection, child abuse prevention, and family support and stabilization.  Exhibit OO, \nSafe Families for Children Fact Sheet. \nSFFC maintains several unique features.  Host families are volunteers and receive no \ncompensation for providing care for a child.  A parent retains all rights to make decisions for \ntheir child while in a Safe Families host home. SFFC also provides mentors and family \ncoaches available to work with the parents and family towards reunification and ongoing \nstabilization of the family unit.  SFFC’s focus is to reunify families and make them stronger \nand more successful and resilient.     \nThe theory of change underlying the Safe Families program is that birth parents who \nvoluntarily place their children with a host family can receive resources and support to reduce \ncrises and chronic problems.  This will lead to a reduction in child maltreatment and avoid the \nremoval and placement of children in foster care.  The use of trained volunteer host families \nwill also assist parents in avoiding social isolation and help to improve parent and child \nfunctioning.   \nSFFC has been in operation in Cook and Northern regions of Illinois for thirteen \nyears.  Due to a grant from the Arnold Foundation, SFFC was recently expanded state-wide to \nprovide services to children and to evaluate the program.  The program evaluation requires a \ntotal of 950 families with 475 families in the control group and 475 families in the \ncomparison group. \nInitial challenges in implementation include a lack of participation by caseworkers and \nidentified clients.   DCFS and Safe Families worked together touring the state and providing \ninformation and education regarding the Safe Families program, referral process and benefits \nof the program.  Additionally, a second randomizer was also implemented within the Safe \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 51 of 60 PageID #:1047\n \nFamilies program that could be utilized when investigators were unwilling to use the initial \nrandomizer.  DCFS continues to train and educate staff on the Safe Families program and is \nproviding the front line investigative staff with information sessions on Safe Families.    \nThe Project Manager on this project is Nora Harms-Pavelski, M.S.W.  The Strategic \nPlanning team will drive the continued progress of this initiative by breaking down barriers to \nsuccess.   \nA logic model and a status report are attached as Exhibit PP.  \n    i.   Theory of Change  \nData analytics helps DCFS to provide timely and accurate data to identify patterns, \ncorrelations, and trends.  This will support decision making by providing key real-time data to \nstakeholders to improve overall performance and achievement of child and family outcomes, as \nmeasure by the CFSR indicators. \n    c.  Information Systems \nDCFS is reviewing the updated regulations on SACWIS to replace the existing SACWIS \nsystem to improve integration of information through web services to third parties, other internal \nsystems, and to enhance its caseworkers' business processes through mobility.  DCFS will \nreceive federal reimbursement for the majority of this investment.  \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/08/11/2015-19087/comprehensive-child-welfare-\ninformation-system.  Given the investment in a new SACWIS system, all current IT projects are \nbeing evaluated by the Technology Governance Board (TGB).  The TGB is comprised of the \nDirector, Chief of Staff, Chief Deputy Director, all Senior Deputy Directors and several other \nkey executives and advisors.  The State CIO, Director of HHSi2 and Director of Enterprise \nApplications also participate. TGB prioritizes all technology-based project work and aligns \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 52 of 60 PageID #:1048\n \nDCFS and Governor’s Office strategy.  TGB directs OITS to maximize technology and human \ncapital.  \n    i.  Near Term Plan (6-12 months) \nDCFS will enhance SACWIS while it evaluates and selects a replacement system.  It is \nexpected that the following SACWIS updates will be made:  \n•  Education Data Feed from ISBE  \n•  Unusual Incident Reporting \n \nIn addition, the following projects are also in process to support DCFS’s improved technology. \n \n•  Mobile Application \n•  On-line Licensing Application \n•  Tablet Application for Licensing Site Inspections \n \n    ii.  Long Term Plan (Beyond 12 months) \nThe SACWIS replacement system will include all existing systems, such as Child and \nYouth Computer Information System, and other case management reporting systems.  Resources \nwill be redirected to the new system other than those previously mentioned.  Selection of the new \nSACWIS system will be the result of an RFP process.  This RFP will be released within the next \ntwelve months.  The time frame for activating the new system will be determined when the \nvendor is selected. \n  d.  Predictive Analytics \nDCFS intends to reduce reliance on external entities to collect and analyze data to drive \noutcomes. DCFS is officially establishing an internal team in OITS to bring the reporting needs \nand the data analytics into a centrally managed organization.   \n  Eckerd has developed a predictive model that will be used to identify those incoming \ninvestigations with the highest probability of serious injury or death and has researched the \nDepartment’s current Child Protective Services Investigations practices. Utilizing the results of \n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 53 of 60 PageID #:1049\n \nthe predictive model and the practice research, Eckerd has developed a web-based secure portal \nthat will present to the Department Quality Assurance staff the cases to be reviewed, the review \nquestions to be answered, the documentation and tracking of any follow-up activities required of \nthe investigator and data for analysis.  Training of staff is ongoing.   \n    i.  Theory of Change  \n  Data analytics helps DCFS to provide timely and accurate data to identify patterns, \ncorrelations, and trends.  This will support decision making by providing key real-time data to \nstakeholders to improve overall performance and achievement of child and family outcomes, as \nmeasure by the CFSR indicators.  A logic model is attached as Exhibit QQ.  A status report \nwhich adheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as Exhibit RR.   \n      ii.  Short Term  \nWhile internal positions are being established and filled, there will be some transitional \nactivity including a contract with MindShare and with Eckerd.  MindShare will collaborate with \nthe Division of Quality Assurance, the Division of Strategic Planning and Innovation, and the \nIllinois Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT).  Contracts began in September 2015 \nand will be in place until January 2018 to assist with the transition and to provide additional \nassistance.  \n  MindShare will provide a dashboard view of DCFS key outcomes in real time.  \nMindShare will provide dashboards for each level of staff from caseworker to Director. This \nsolution will use embedded metrics to present actionable intelligence to front line as well as \nadministrative staff.  The CFSR measures will be delivered by MindShare via dashboards within \n30 days of the finalized contract.  There will be additional dashboards delivered to include the \nDirector’s 26 Metrics and others. See Contract Cover Page and Scope of Services for the ICARE \nProgram, attached as Exhibit SS. \n50 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 54 of 60 PageID #:1050\n \n      iii.  Long Term (Beyond 18 Months) \nThe State of Illinois is establishing a state-wide enterprise data analytics platform \n(“Enterprise IT”).  DCFS intends to reduce reliance on external entities to collect and analyze \ndata to drive outcomes.  DCFS expects to reduce, but not eliminate, the need for occasional \nexternal services.  Enterprise IT is currently under review by the State CIO’s office and the \nHealth and Human Services Innovation Incubator’s (HHSi2) office. DCFS will continue to work \nclosely with the state’s new CIO to adopt an interoperable Health and Human Services \nframework that will be conducive to data sharing and integrated service delivery across state \nagencies.  The TGB will prioritize IT initiatives to ensure alignment with the state’s vision for \nEnterprise IT. \n  e.  Data Not Included in Overarching Outcome Measures \n  DCFS recognizes that the safety and permanency outcome measures currently utilized by \nthe federal government in the CFSR process do not capture other relevant information related to \nsafety and permanency. The Children and Family Research Center (CFRC) publishes its annual \nMonitoring Report of the B.H. Consent Decree entitled Conditions of Children In or At Risk of \nFoster Care In Illinois.  This report tracks data indicators related to child safety; children in \nsubstitute care; legal permanence; and child wellbeing. Though not as a measure of compliance \nwith the Expert Panel’s report and recommendations, DCFS will obtain from CFRC and track \nadditional indicators of re-entry, stability and maltreatment for the B.H. class.  Additional \nindicators include, but are not limited to: re-entry rates for children in foster care 12 to 23 months \nand longer than 23 months who are discharged to reunification, adoption, living with a relative, \nor guardianship; rate of placement moves per day for all children in foster care; and maltreatment \nrecurrence for all children within 12 months of a substantiated report (including those children \nwho remain at home, those served in intact family cases and those who do not receive services; \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 55 of 60 PageID #:1051\n \nany maltreatment recurrence for children who leave substitute care through adoption, \nguardianship, and return home).   \n  3.  Training and Coaching Program \n \n•  The Department should initiate a program for training and ongoing coaching of \nproject administrators on how to provide effective coordination and supervision. \nThis training should not only include supervision on completion of responsibilities \nbut on clinical matters as well. \n \n•  The training should emphasize that data should be used positively as a means \nfor assisting managers in exploring new ways of improving program \nperformance rather than negatively as an excuse for rendering unsatisfactory \nassessments of the performance of managers responsible for the program. \n \nDCFS is initiating the MoSP as detailed in Recommendation # 2 that includes in-depth \ntraining and coaching in recognition of the need for mid-level managers to have appropriate \nskills and training to manage projects from planning to implementation and for ongoing \nsuccess.  DCFS will implement additional training to: 1)  build the knowledge and skill set of \nmid-level DCFS managers, 2) educate DCFS managers on the use of data to improve \nperformance, 3) foster collegiality among DCFS managers, and; 4) enhance the effectiveness \nof managers as they safely and appropriately reduce the number of children and youth in care \nin Illinois. The additional training, called the Success Academy, will include ten workshops \nover a six-month period, eventually including all mid-level managers.  The initial cohort of \nparticipants completed the program in July 2016. The initial series of trainings focused on \nenhancing and building knowledge and skill sets, understanding how organizations work, \neffective communication, effective decision making and problem solving.  Exhibit TT, \nDirector’s Announcement.  The second cohort of participants began the Success Academy in \napproximately August 2016.  Monico Whittington-Eskridge, Associate Deputy Director of the \nOffice of the Office of Professional Development, will lead the project. \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 56 of 60 PageID #:1052\n \n  E.  Panel Recommendation #5:  Restore funding for the Illinois Survey of Child  \n  and Adolescent Wellbeing that uses standardized instruments and      \n  assessment scales modeled after the national Survey of Child and Adolescent    \n  Wellbeing to monitor and evaluate changes in the safety, permanence, and well-  \n  being of children for a representative sample of DCFS-involved children and    \n  their caregivers.  \n \n  1.   Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (ISCAW) \n  DCFS is working with the Children and Family Research Center to plan for reinstituting \nthe Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing.    A logic model is attached as Exhibit \nUU.  A status report which adheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as Exhibit VV.  \nIn August 2016, the Steering Committee for the Illinois Child Well-Being Study 2017 reached \nconsensus on all major elements of the methodology for the study.  The well-being study will be \na point-in-time study of the well-being of the population of children in open placement cases as \nof a selected date during FY2017.  It will replicate most of the methods of the Illinois Child \nWell-Being Year 3 launched in 2004, with additional new features including:  updated methods \nto enhance caseworker participation and increase caseworker response rates and a brief measure \nof child life satisfaction to enhance measurement of positive child well-being.  \n  The team is also exploring opportunities to enrich the well-being study by supplementing \nprimary data collection with data on the sample from other sources, including Child and \nAdolescent Needs and Strengths Scale (CANs); Trauma Comprehensive Version collected \nduring the Integrated Assessment; health data in SACWIS, education data from the Illinois State \nBoard of Education (ISBE):, and placement data from the DCFS Integrated Database.  Any use \nof these data sets will take time to develop, and will postdate primary data collection for the \nstudy to enable the most timely possible implementation of the study.  \n \n \n53 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 57 of 60 PageID #:1053\n \n  F.  Panel Recommendation #6: The implementation plan will provide for the  \n  Department to contract with an external partner to perform an effective     \n  residential and group-home monitoring program.  The Department shall use   \n  an external partner for that function until such time as the Department has    \n  sufficient staff with the necessary experience and clinical expertise to perform   \n  the function internally and further has developed an in-house program that    \n  can monitor residential and group-home placements effectively.    \n \n  DCFS will develop a new plan for monitoring of residential and group homes.  \n \n    1.  Theory of Change \n \n  The theory of change developed for residential monitoring is premised on the fact that to \nachieve positive outcomes, residential programs must effectively implement and sustain \nappropriate evidence-based or evidence-informed interventions within an enabling organizational \nculture and climate. Consequently, residential performance teams should be clinically driven and \ndraw upon Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) principles and research on organizational \neffectiveness and implementation science.  In addition, these teams should perform traditional \nmonitoring functions that prioritize youth safety as well as provide additional support for youth \nwith urgent clinical needs.  A logic model is attached as Exhibit WW.  A status report which \nadheres to the structure of the logic model is attached as Exhibit XX.     \n  DCFS, along with the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University have \ndeveloped a redesigned residential monitoring program. The aims of the redesigned residential \nmonitoring program will be the increased safety of youth placed at residential treatment facilities \nand the enhancement of the effectiveness of the residential services provided at the residential \ntreatment facilities.  The core components of the redesign include:  a therapeutic residential \nprogram model that is aligned with the FTS core practice model and DCFS policy, assessment of \norganizational effectiveness and capacity building activities, systemic and structured monitoring \nof the implementation of the child’s plan developed by the CFT, clinically driven monitoring \nprocess that incorporates the CFT-developed plan, clinical consultation and interventions, \n54 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 58 of 60 PageID #:1054\n \ncommunication and collaboration with DCFS staff to break down silos, prioritization of family \nand youth voices and concerns, integrated data system and advocacy to address system barriers.   \n  The plan will require the development of regional multi-disciplinary monitoring teams \nthat will assess a residential program’s effectiveness utilizing multiple data sources and inputs.  \nThe focus of the teams will be on the CQI and individualized approach to monitoring.  The \nmonitoring team will promote a strong CFT and discharge planning process for all youth placed \nin a residential treatment facility.  The Residential Monitoring Redesign Project Work Plan is \nattached as Exhibit YY.  DCFS will continue to work with the Expert Panel and University \npartners and will update when additions or revisions are made to the monitoring program. \nV.  Communication Plan \n  In furtherance of the collaborative process that has been established as part of this \nImplementation Plan, DCFS will engage in robust and mutual communication with the Expert \nPanel throughout the implementation process.  A Communication Plan was submitted to the \nCourt for approval on July 25, 2016.  The plan includes bi-weekly conferences by telephone or in \nperson with the Expert Panel and the Parties during which there will be discussion each initiative \nset forth in the Implementation Plan, including barriers encountered and potential solutions.   \nDCFS will provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ Counsel which will detail \nthe specific steps that have been taken regarding actual implementation of each initiative set \nforth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers that exist and strategies \nto eliminate or resolve the barriers and a comparison to the planned results as documented in the \nImplementation Plan. The Communication Plan does not limit the Experts from requesting \nadditional meetings, teleconferences or communications, or from requesting implementation-\nrelated information from the Department (whether in written form or otherwise), or the \nDepartment’s or Plaintiffs’ ability to raise matters in consultation with the Experts.   \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 59 of 60 PageID #:1055\n \nVI.  Project for a Target Group of Children and Youth \n  On June 17, 2016, the Expert Panel submitted a letter to the Court asking that DCFS \ndevelop and executed a plan to provide services for an agreed-upon subset of the Plaintiff class. \nWhile the parties and the Expert Panel agree that systemic change accomplished through the \napplication of implementation science is not a speedy process, there is a need to address \nimmediate concerns.  Accordingly, following the July 11, 2016, hearing, the parties submitted a \nproposed project for a target group of children and youth.   \n  The Expert Panel requested that DCFS identify a target group of one hundred (100) \nchildren and youth from Cook County who are in psychiatric hospitals beyond medical necessity \nin order to determine their specific service and support needs and develop an approach to better \ncare for and serve them. The parties and the Expert Panel agree that the target group shall \ninitially include children and youth from Cook County who are in psychiatric hospitals and \ndetermined to be beyond medical necessity.  The parties and the Expert Panel will evaluate \nwhether to add additional children and youth, including youth in residential treatment facilities \nready for discharge, as the project is developed and operationalized.   \n  Fifty (50) youth with whom the caseworker has been assessed to have a strong \nrelationship will be assigned coaches.  These coaches and caseworkers will be authorized to \npurchase and tailor services to meet the needs of the youth.  The child and family teams will \ninclude everyone important in the youth’s life, including the caseworker, the coach, providers, \nfamily, mentors, caregivers, clinicians, and the youth.  A comparison group of fifty (50) will also \nconsist of youth who have a strong relationship with the caseworker, but the caseworker will not \nbe assigned a coach.  Instead, the children will receive services as usual with no expanded array \nof intensive evidence-based services beyond what is customarily available.  A second \n56 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 531 Filed: 09/28/16 Page 60 of 60 PageID #:1056\n \ncomparison group will be fifty (50) BMN youth who are assessed not to have a strong \nrelationship with their caseworker and their outcomes will be tracked as part of the evaluation.   \n  The program will be evaluated by the B.H. Experts by tracking proximal and distal \noutcomes. Children and youth will be selected from the actual population in beyond medical \nnecessity status during the time the project is operational.   \n  The timeline for implementation begins in September, 2016 with the review of five cases \nto further refine the plan the logic model.  It is anticipated that the project will be operational by \nNovember, 2016.  A logic model is attached as Exhibit ZZ.  A status report which adheres to the \nstructure of the logic model is attached as Exhibit AAA.     \n \nENTERED: \n \n \n9/28/16          __________________________________ \n            Jorge L.

DCFS, \nalong with the Plaintiffs and Expert Panel, submits the following as the first triannual Report to \nthe Court, discussing each of the projects identified in the Implementation Plan.  Following this \nCourt’s approval of the Implementation Plan and the Parties’ Communication Plan, there have \nbeen regular bi-weekly meetings with the Expert Panel, Plaintiffs, and Project Managers.  \nMonthly reports for each project also are being provided to the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs.  This \ncollaboration has assisted in identifying whether projects are proceeding according to plan as \nwell as barriers to progress.  It further provides a means for the Department to determine when \nand whether there is a need to revise or reconsider a project.  Through this ongoing process, \nDCFS has made revisions, large and small, where progress has been slower than anticipated.   \n  For this Report to the Court, the status of each project was graded by the Expert Panel on \na scale ranging from Exemplary, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement, to Unsatisfactory.  Grading \nis based on the Expert Panel’s assessment of the Department’s actual implementation of each \nproject, not on substantive project outcomes themselves or the extent of the Department’s efforts \nand activities for each project.  Overall, two of the projects were graded Exemplary, nine were \ngraded Satisfactory, five were graded Needs Improvement, and two were graded Unsatisfactory.   \nThe Expert Panel arrived at these grades after each project was presented by Project Managers to \nthe Expert Panel and Plaintiffs at a two-day meeting, dubbed “mid-term exams,” that was \nconducted by the Expert Panel on January 5 and 6, 2017.   The specific evaluation grades are as \nfollows:  \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 5 of 76 PageID #:1513\nProject  Evaluation Grade \nApplication of Implementation Science   Needs Improvement \nOverarching Outcome Measures  Exemplary \nTherapeutic Foster Care Pilots    Unsatisfactory \nCare Management Entity Pilot  Needs Improvement \nRegenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved Youth at Cook County  Satisfactory \nJuvenile Detention Center \nIllinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved Youth   Needs Improvement \nImmersion Sites Pilot  Satisfactory \nAmended Definition of “Fictive Kin”  Satisfactory \nExpanding State Funded Guardianship  Satisfactory \nFamily Finding Project  Unsatisfactory   \nDCFS Reorganization  Exemplary \nIllinois Birth Thru Three Project  Satisfactory \nSAFE Families for Children Project  Satisfactory \nInformation Systems Enhancement/Replacement Project  Satisfactory \nRestore Funding for the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Well- Needs Improvement \nBeing Study \nDevelop and Implement a New Plan for Monitoring Residential and Group  Needs Improvement \nHome Programs \nImplement a Defined Communication Plan Satisfactory \nTarget Group of Children and Youth in Psychiatric Hospitals Beyond  Satisfactory \nMedical Necessity Pilot \n \n  Apart from the grades on the projects themselves, the Expert Panel has assessed the \nDepartment’s overall progress on the goals in the Implementation Plan as Satisfactory for this \ninitial triannual report. The Department, Plaintiffs and Expert Panel would like to have seen far \nmore progress in reducing youths’ length of stay in residential facilities and increasing \nplacements in community and home-based settings in order for youth to live successfully in the \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 6 of 76 PageID #:1514\nleast restrictive, most family-like setting.  However, there has been some progress toward \nreducing the number of children in congregate care.   \n  Drawing from Department Child and Youth Comprehensive Information System \n(CYCIS) information from January 2000 through September 2016, the following trends in the \nutilization of congregate care1 have been observed.  See Exhibit A, Chapin Hall and DCFS FY \n17 Mid-Year Meeting, slides 6-11. \n  About 3% of youth in care are placed on average each month in congregate care \nsettings; since January 2015 utilization appears to be trending lower; \n \n  About 32% of exits from congregate care on average per month are to less restrictive \nhome or home-based settings; since January 2015 exit to home or home-based \nplacements has risen on average;  \n \n  About 62% of exits on average per month from congregate care do not re-enter \nResidential Treatment Centers (RTC) within 6 months of discharge; since January \n2015 re-entry appears to be trending lower. \n \n In March 2016, the most recent month for which six months of follow-up data were available at \nthe time of the analysis, 73% of congregate care discharges did not re-enter congregate care \nwithin six months of congregate exit.    \nThere is a shared recognition that continuing to develop and sustaining needed services to \nchildren and youth with psychological, behavioral or emotional challenges requires a major “sea \nchange” for DCFS in mindset, policy, practice, and continuing quality improvement. The \nDepartment has solidified its reorganization and strengthened its B.H. leadership positions by \nclarifying their responsibilities and authority. According to the Expert Panel and the Parties, \nthere is some evidence of movement to achieve the “sea change” necessary for serving class \n                                                            \n1 For purposes of this analysis, Chapin Hall used the Department’s CYCIS database to define \ncongregate care placements as including group homes and other institution-private care facilities \nand excluding shelter placements.   \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 7 of 76 PageID #:1515\nmembers appropriately, most notably in Immersion Sites as the seeds of change begin to take \nroot.  \nThe Department has four Immersion Site Directors in place, each of whom has identified \npolicy and practice barriers impeding the development and delivery of needed services, and has \ntaken steps to address a number of these barriers.  Examples of policy and practice barriers that \nthe Immersion Site Directors have acted to modify or eliminate include: a) DCFS adoption staff \nare working with private agency adoption staff to resolve the backlog in adoption and \nguardianship subsidies; b) the state-managed “case rotation” assignment of new cases among \nprivate agencies has been replaced by a community-based team process which places children in \nthe most appropriate placement and not the next placement on the rotation; c) phones will be \nprovided to parents who do not have them so that they make immediate contact with their child’s \nfoster parents to continue their relationships with their children while in the foster home; and d) \nDCFS will share foster homes it has recruited, but is unable to complete licensure for in a timely \nmanner, with private agencies so homes can be licensed more quickly.   \nThe progress achieved to date will be meaningful only if it is sustained while additional \nmeasureable progress occurs with the goals of the Implementation Plan.  It takes time to embed \nthe kinds of policy, practice and mindset changes required for successful achievement of the \ngoals in the Implementation Plan, just as it takes time to develop and sustain the needed array of \nintensive home and community-based services. During the next reporting period, the \nDepartment, Plaintiffs’ counsel and the Expert Panel will examine the different initiatives and \nprojects that the Department is implementing to determine how best to prioritize implementation \nefforts among the initiatives.  The goal will be to ensure that the initiatives most crucial for \naddressing the needs of children and youth with serious psychological, behavioral or emotional \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 8 of 76 PageID #:1516\nchallenges are prioritized. It is not realistic for the Department to apply the same level of focus \nand resources to all of the initiatives and projects included in the Implementation Plan at the \nsame time.    \nI.  Application of Implementation Science to the Implementation Plan:  Utilize principles of \nImplementation Science to develop, implement, evaluate and modify initiatives outlined in the \nB.H. Implementation Plan.   \n   \n1.  Project Goals / Target: The Order entered by this Court on July 11, 2016 [Dkt. \n527] provides for DCFS’ retention of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN), to \nreview and comment on DCFS’ adherence to best practices in implementation science and assist \nwith an assessment of DCFS’ implementation capacity and strategy.  DCFS will be working with \nDr. Allison Metz, Director of NIRN, who is experienced in the application of implementation \nscience to inform plans in child welfare.  There was no deadline set in the Implementation Plan \nor by the Court for the Department to engage NIRN’s services.   \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade: Needs Improvement.    \n \n3.          Status Report:  On August 18, 2016, Dr. Metz met with the Expert Panel and \ndiscussed NIRN’s participation in reviewing the Department’s adherence to implementation \nscience.  In September, Dr. Metz discussed with the Department an appropriate budget for her \ninvolvement going forward for an estimated eight hours per month.  Thereafter the Department \nprepared the documents necessary to comply with the Illinois state procurement process:  a \ndecision memo, a small business set-aside program waiver, and a procurement business case.  \nHowever, the Department experienced delays in finalizing the contract with Dr. Metz due to the \nlength of the Department’s procurement process and Dr. Metz’s travel schedule. Effective \nFebruary 14, 2017, the Department has an executed a contract with Dr. Metz to provide the \nservices outlined above.   \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 9 of 76 PageID #:1517\nLogic models for implementation initiatives are a significant component of the \nimplementation process.  The Department, with the assistance of the Expert Panel, has developed \nlogic models for each Implementation Plan initiative.  Several logic models have been adjusted \nas the work has proceeded; in one case, with respect to Residential Monitoring, the pilot project \nand the logic model were substantially revised.  See discussion infra at pp. 68-70.  The \nDepartment provided the logic models for each initiative to Dr. Metz on February 10, 2017.   \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  Upon execution of the contract, Dr. Metz will provide \nguidance and direction on the implementation of the projects in accordance with the principles of \nimplementation science.   \nII.  Overarching Outcome Measures:  DCFS will identify metrics to assess the safety, \npermanency and well-being of class members.  (Implementation Plan, pp. 4-6).      \n \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan requires the Department to \nmeasure safety, permanency and well-being of class members and to monitor changes in both the \nquality and quantity of services and supports to class members and their families.   This initiative \nfollows the B.H. Implementation Plan’s call for the Department to begin gathering and analyzing \ndata, measuring outcomes, and evaluating the success of programs according to the newest and \nmost advanced standards for public accountability in consent decree monitoring. Nationwide, the \nfirst generation of consent decree monitoring focused primarily on enforcing agency compliance \nwith fixed performance rules, e.g. caseload ratios, timetables, etc., regardless of whether \ncompliance actually linked to improved outcomes. The second generation focused on \nestablishing performance targets, e.g. % reunified, % re-entered, etc., and tracking their \nachievement without necessarily knowing if and how the achievements linked to agency \nperformance. The third generation, which the B.H. Implementation Plan is using, focuses on \nevaluating the validity and integrity of pilot demonstrations of services in actually attaining \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 10 of 76 PageID #:1518\nperformance targets before rolling out new services or service models system wide. This newest \nphase of public accountability, which the Expert Panel calls “results-oriented accountability,” \nrequires continuous monitoring of implementation integrity and tracking of overarching outcome \nmeasures in real time. \nThe metrics DCFS will use for measuring safety and permanency are the same measures \nused in the national Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSR), and the measures for well-being \nare based on a matrix developed by the Child Welfare Advisory Sub-Committee.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 4-7.  The Implementation Plan provided for Mindshare, a data \ntechnology company that creates innovative analytics to monitor progress in child welfare \nsystems, to provide dashboards2 with the CFSR measures within 30 days after its contract was \nexecuted.  The contract was signed on February 5, 2016, such that the dashboards should have \nbeen available as of March 5, 2016.  Implementation Plan at 50, Ex. SS. Thereafter, further \ndashboards were to be delivered, but no deadlines were set for those additional dashboards. \nThere is no specific deadline in the Implementation Plan for implementation of a system \nallowing the Department to track the metrics for measuring well-being.    \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Exemplary.   \n \n  3.          Status Report: While the timeline anticipated in the Implementation Plan has \nnot been met as to the safety and permanency measures, DCFS has made commendable progress \non this difficult initiative.   \nWebsite Development That Will, inter alia, Track Permanency and Stability \nMeasures.  DCFS has made significant progress in developing a website, through the Mindshare \n                                                            \n2 The dashboards are tools for visualizing and communicating information about youth in care \nand youth in specific pilots in “real time” that can be used to understand how specific pilots may \nimpact the outcomes of and services provided to youth in care.  \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 11 of 76 PageID #:1519\nplatform,3 that integrates real time data from multiple locations across the DCFS system that are \nneeded to track permanency and stability.4 (See Screen Shot below)\n \nUsing data sets provided by the Department, the Mindshare platform allows various dashboards \nand other reports to be developed and used by DCFS to monitor the implementation of pilot \ndemonstrations and the tracking of overarching outcome measures in real time.  Exhibit B, Four \nMonth Status Report IT Mindshare, p. 1.  \n  DCFS has developed data sets in the Mindshare platform for the safety, permanency and \nstability measures identified in the Implementation Plan.  The safety, permanency and stability \nmeasures include: rate of victimization per day of foster care of all children in foster care during \na 12 month period, permanence in 12 months for children entering foster care, permanence in 12 \nmonths for children in foster care 12 to 23 months, permanence in 12 months for children in \n                                                            \n3 The Department is making additional improvements in the IT area, which are discussed below \nat pp. 59-66.   \n4 The data sets with green stars are dashboards in which the content has been validated; the data \nsets with yellow stars are dashboards in which the data sets are available, but not yet finalized \nand validated; and the grey stars are dashboards that are to be developed.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 12 of 76 PageID #:1520\nfoster care 24 months or more, re-entry to foster care in 12 months, and placement stability.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 5-6.  The data sets for the safety,  permanency and stability measures \nare available for review.  However, these data sets are not yet validated.    \n  Integration of Well-Being Measures Into the Website.  The measures for well-being \nare based on a matrix of well-being indicators.  Implementation Plan, pp. 6-7.  One of the \nexisting sources for the well-being data will be gathered from the Child and Adolescent Needs \nand Strengths (CANS) tool.  The CANS is a multi-purpose tool developed for children’s services \nto support decision making (including level of care and service planning), to facilitate quality \nimprovement initiatives, and to allow for the monitoring of outcomes of services. Versions of the \nCANS are currently used in 50 states in child welfare, mental health, juvenile justice, and early \nintervention applications.  CANS generally measures life functioning domains, child strengths, \nbehavioral and emotional needs, child risk behaviors, caregiver needs, and strengths and needs \nthrough a variety specific questions. \n  DCFS is currently considering what version of the CANS should be incorporated into the \nStatewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS).  DCFS currently has a \nversion of CANS that can be incorporated into SACWIS, however, other human services \nagencies such as the Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) and the Department \nof Human Services are developing, with the input of DCFS,  another version of CANS, referred \nto as the Illinois Medicaid (IM CANS) CANS, to be used by those agencies.  The IM CANS \nincorporates additional factors that are geared for the adult population and is intended to be a \nlifespan document, meaning the it can be used for individuals from childhood to adulthood  The \ncurrent plan is to implement the IM CANS in the other human services agencies in July 2017.  If \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 13 of 76 PageID #:1521\nDCFS were to incorporate the IM CANS in July 2017, there would be a delay in the \nincorporation of the data into SACWIS due to the current implementation date of the IM CANS.   \n  Validation of CANS Data.   DCFS agreed to validate information from the CANS \nthrough the use of a variety of other data set forth in the CWAC wellbeing matrix.  Some of the \ninformation in the Wellbeing matrix is accessible through a variety of databases, such as \ndevelopmental assessments of youth zero to three and information from the Illinois State Board \nof Education (ISBE).  Other information in the Well Being matrix for use as a validation tool, \nincluding some health information from HFS and information from ISBE, will require significant \ndata configuration that is estimated to take six to 12 months. For example, one of the physical \nhealth validation measures in the CWAC wellbeing matrix is emergency room visit frequency \nfor non-chronic health diagnosis.  Implementation Plan, Exhibit F, Wellbeing Matrix, p. 2.  \nWhile DCFS can currently obtain emergency room visit frequency for youth in care from HFS, \nSACWIS is not currently configured to accept specific information from HFS such as the reason \nfor the emergency room visit.   Additionally, the data from the ISBE does not contain \ninformation regarding grade point averages and school expulsions.  \n  In the interim, while the DCFS Office of Information Technology Services (OITS) is \nreconfiguring the SACWIS system to incorporate more detailed information from HFS and \nworking to develop the data that is not contained in the ISBE data, DCFS has other health \ninformation data from the E-Health Passport and from the Children’s Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), that can be used to validate the CANS data.  For \nexample, DCFS has dashboards that contain EPSDT data for youth in care in congregate care \nsettings, immunization data on youth in care, and preventive dental compliance for youth in care.  \nExhibit C, DCFS Office of Health Services Compliance Reports.  DCFS has additional data from \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 14 of 76 PageID #:1522\nthe Illinois CHIPRA program and the national CHIPRA program.  Exhibit D, Healthworks of \nIllinois, CHIPRA Measures FY2010-FY2014.5  This information will be used to validate the \nCANS data in the interim period.  \n  Expansion of Access to the Website.  The Expert Panel and DCFS both agree that the \nMindshare platform provides the potential to transform DCFS’ access to real time data.  DCFS \nmanagers can access the Mindshare platform to judge the effectiveness of various programs and \npolicies.  Immersion Site Directors and project managers were trained in Mindshare in December \n2016 in Springfield.  Remaining DCFS staff will be trained as the Mindshare dashboards are \ndeveloped. The provision of this training will be the topic of discussion at the next in-person \nmeeting of DCFS with the Expert Panel in April 2017.   \n      Currently, access to the Mindshare platform is limited to DCFS administrators and \nExecutive staff.  However, it is also helpful for outside providers to have access because it assists \nthose providers in judging the effectiveness of their programs as well.  DCFS must develop a \nsecurity protocol before it can allow outside providers’ access to the Mindshare website since the \nwebsite contains information on all youth in care.   \nDCFS is developing data sets in the Mindshare platform for each of the pilots and \nprograms identified in the Implementation Plan. The addition of data sets for some of these \nprograms has required a reprioritization of the work to track the well-being measures.  Though \nthere are no deadlines in the Implementation Plan relating to the time for incorporation of \nthewell-being measures.  DCFS recognizes the importance of tracking these measures and \n                                                            \n5 Another method for validating the well-being data pulled from CANS will be the quality \nservice review process in the Immersion Sites.  Implementation Plan, p. 7. See Quality Service \nReview discussion at pp. 39-40. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 15 of 76 PageID #:1523\nintends to begin tracking as many as possible in the next reporting period through use of the data \nfrom e-Health passport and CHIPRA, described above.     \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  DCFS anticipates the safety, permanency, and \nstability measures to be fully validated by June 2017.   The CANS data relative to the well-being \nis currently scheduled to be integrated into the DCFS SACWIS system in the first quarter of \nFY18, (i.e., July through September 2017).  These targets may be altered depending on which \nCANS tool DCFS decides to integrate into SACWIS.  DCFS will decide whether to implement \nthe IM CANS by the next reporting period.   \nRepresentatives from the OITS, Legal Services, and Operations are meeting in \nSpringfield on February 14, 2017, to address incorporation of the CANS data and identify \nbarriers in obtaining the ISBE data and developing a plan to obtain the needed data.   \n  The Department, working with the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs, will agree by April 30, \n2017, on the prioritization of the different B.H. projects for completion and incorporation into \nMindshare and a timeline by program stating when the data for the program and associated \ndashboards will be up and running on Mindshare.  \nIII. Implementation of Specific Recommendations of the Expert Panel \n \nPanel Recommendation #1:  Institute a children’s system of care demonstration program that \npermits POS agencies and DCFS sub-regions to waive selected policy and funding restrictions \non a trial basis in order to reduce the use of residential treatment and help children and youth \nsucceed in living in the least restrictive, most family-like setting.  (Implementation Plan, pp. 7-\n25).  \n \nThe Implementation Plan identifies several initiatives that the Department is pursuing in \nresponse to Recommendation # 1.  Those initiatives are the Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots, the \nCase Management Entity pilot, and two additional programs that are both targeted to the needs of \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 16 of 76 PageID #:1524\n“dually involved youth” – the Regenerations pilot and Pay for Success.  Each of these programs \nhas been separately graded by the Expert Panel and each is discussed individually below. \n  A.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Therapeutic Foster Care Pilots  \n \n1.  Project Goals / Target: The Implementation Plan calls for the Department to \nselect private agencies to implement evidence-based or evidence-informed therapeutic foster care \nprograms over the next five years.  The goal of the TFC pilot is to determine whether outcomes \nfor youth served in the TFC pilot programs are equal to or better than those for youth who meet \nthe clinical criteria for residential treatment and are placed in residential treatment. \nImplementation Plan, pp. 8-13.   \nAt least 60% of the youth served in TFC licensed homes will be ages 12 years and older.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 8-9.  DCFS set a two-year goal for the recruitment and licensure of \ntherapeutic foster parents and placements.  The original goal included placement of a minimum \nof 40 children and youth in licensed TFC homes at the end of the “first contractual year” and \nplacement of a minimum of 100 children and youth at the end of the “second contractual year.”  \nThe Implementation Plan, however, did not specify whether these “contractual year” deadlines \nreferred to “development” contracts that the Department intended to execute with the providers \nor to “service” contracts that would be executed later.   \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Unsatisfactory.  \n \n  3.          Status Report: The Department selected three agencies for the pilot project:  \nLutheran Social Services of Illinois (LSSI), Jewish Child and Family Services (JCFS), and \nChildren’s Home and Aid of Illinois (CHAID).  Development contracts with these agencies were \nsigned in August, September, and October, 2016, respectively.  The three agencies established \nprojections for the number of TFC foster homes to be certified, consistent with the targets \nincluded in the Implementation Plan. The targets for the end of the first contractual year were as \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 17 of 76 PageID #:1525\nfollows:  LSSI – 30 homes; JCFS – 10 homes; CHAID – 10 homes.  To date, however, no TFC \nhomes have been certified.  As of February 1, 2017, no children have received services under the \npilot program.  DCFS has executed service contracts for TFC programs with JCFS and CHAID.  \nOne youth is scheduled to be placed in a JCFS TFC home in the next several weeks.  \nDevelopment Contract Activities.  DCFS’ development contracts with the three \nagencies were written for a five-month period and allowed for activities such as the hiring of \nnecessary staff for the individual TFC programs being implemented.  LSSI and JCFS each hired \na Program Director, clinical director, clinician, foster parent licensing worker, recruitment \nworker and a licensing supervisor. LSSI hired a team leader and a foster parent resource worker \nfor each of the three geographic areas covered in the pilot.  CHAID hired a Program Manager, \nfoster home recruitment specialist and licensing worker. CHAID is in the process of hiring four \nadditional staff. Exhibit E, Therapeutic Foster Care BH Four Month Status Report, January 17, \n2017.  Each of the agencies is in the process of training staff in the relevant evidence-based \nmodels they are implementing.   \nThe three agencies also commenced recruitment activities for TFC foster parents.  The \nrecruitment activities vary by agency and include:  meetings with foster parent networks and \ncommunity social service agencies, outreach to various community leaders, such as state \nrepresentatives and local alderman, schools and churches and use of social media platforms such \nas agency websites, Facebook pages and Instagram.   \nDCFS recognizes that continuously tracking all contact with potential foster parents from \ninquiry to licensure and TFC certification is essential for developing a successful TFC program, \nand it has directed the providers to track their recruitment activities and outcomes, by family, and \nprovide bi-monthly reports to DCFS.  LSSI is being allowed to utilize its own internal tracking \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 18 of 76 PageID #:1526\nsystem because that it is able to generate reports containing all of the information needed to \nassess the success and effectiveness of its recruitment process.  DCFS has directed JCFS and \nCHAID to use the recruitment tracking system that DCFS developed because those agencies \nhave not provided reports containing the needed recruitment information. Exhibit F, TFC \nTracking.   \nStatus of TFC Recruitment.  LSSI  is actively working with ten already-licensed foster \nfamilies who want to become certified as TFC homes under the TFC-O model.  Six of those \nfamilies were originally licensed by LSSI;  the remaining four families are licensed at other \nagencies and seek to transfer their foster home license to LSSI and become TFC-O certified with \nLSSI. That transfer of license is expected to take place by June 30, 2017.  LSSI is actively \nworking with another 19 families that are not yet licensed as foster homes. LSSI expects to \ncomplete training in the TFC-O model for sixteen of those families in February 2017.  For the \npilot, LSSI will not place a child until a home has been licensed with or had a license transferred \nto LSSI and has been certified in the TFC-O model.  It is anticipated that six LSSI homes \ncertified in TFC-O model will be ready to accept children in March 2017.  \nJCFS has one licensed family ready to serve an adolescent TFC child.  The home has not \nyet become TFC-certified because the TFC model JCFS is using (unlike the model used by \nLSSI) begins training licensed foster parents in TFC interventions coincident with the family’s \nfirst TFC placement.  JCFS has nine additional families in the inquiry phase who may participate \nin the pilot.  Two families are already licensed and the other seven are not yet licensed.  JCFS \nhas a total of two homes that are active in the assessment phase that are not licensed.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 19 of 76 PageID #:1527\nCHAID has identified two families who are currently in the licensing process to become \nfoster parents and then to be certified as TFC homes. One of these homes is slated to serve a TFC \nreferral from CHAID’s residential program.    \nTFC research and field experience show that the most successful recruitment efforts \nfocus on networking with and using former and current foster parents for recruitment purposes, \nreferred to as word of mouth recruitment.  As evidence of this research and field finding, LSSI \nreported in its January 2017 report that more than 87% of the families actively pursuing TFC \ncertification with their agency were identified through word of mouth recruitment.       \nDCFS and the agencies have established the eligibility criteria for youth to be placed in \nthe TFC homes as part of this pilot. The Child and Adolescent Intensity Instrument (CASII) has \nbeen identified as the instrument to determine clinical eligibility for a TFC placement.  Exhibit \nG, Therapeutic Foster Care B.H. Four Month Status Report, January 17, 2017.  \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \nThe agencies have asked DCFS to extend the initial development contracts, and DCFS \nexpects to do so for a limited additional period.  DCFS has sent service contracts to the three \nagencies; two of the agencies have executed those contracts and DCFS expects the remaining \ncontract to be executed by April 1, 2017. The service contracts will extend until the end of Fiscal \nYear 2017.  \nThe revised timeline for the TFC pilot is to have a minimum of 40 children and youth in \nlicensed TFC homes by April 1, 2018 and to have placement of a minimum of 100 children and \nyouth by April 1, 2019, with at least 60% of the youth served in the age group of 12 and older.   \nDCFS will continue to monitor closely the progress of the three agencies to recruit and \ncertify TFC foster homes so that DCFS can meet the deadlines set forth in the Implementation \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 20 of 76 PageID #:1528\nPlan. DCFS will take the steps necessary to ensure that TFC services are developed by these or \nother providers or programs. If DCFS determines it will not be able to meet the targeted number \nof 40 TFC placements by the estimated April 1, 2018 date, DCFS, in consultation with the \nExpert Panel and Plaintiffs’ counsel, will revise the TFC placement goals for this pilot and will \nexplore alternative options, with these or other providers or programs, for development of TFC \nhomes in the targeted areas.    \nB.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Care Management Entity \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \nThe planned goals for the Care Management Entity or “CME” pilot include:  increasing \nnon-traditional, community-based behavioral health supports; faster step-downs for youth in \ncongregate care settings (i.e., 15% of enrolled youth to step down six months after enrollment \nand another 15% to step down 12 months after enrollment); treating youth and family voice and \nchoice as primary factors in permanency planning and mental health/behavioral health \ninterventions; reduction in youth experiencing elevations in level of care (i.e., youth being placed \nin specialized foster care or congregate care settings); increased placement stability at the \ntraditional foster care level (i.e., fewer lateral moves); high service-intensity youth receiving \nnecessary behavioral health supports and services in their home and community settings; \ndecreased psychiatric hospitalization; and increased permanency.   \nThe CME pilot, which is administered though CHOICES, a care management entity, \nbegan in February 2014 and is scheduled to continue through June 30, 2017.  The goal of the \npilot was to serve 200 youth annually and 600 youth during the course of the pilot.  DCFS \ncommitted to identifying a comparison group for the evaluation by December 2016 and to \ncompleting an interim evaluation by March 2017.  Implementation Plan, p. 19.  \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Needs Improvement.  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 21 of 76 PageID #:1529\n \n  3.          Status Report:  The CME pilot currently is operating in four counties in central \nIllinois.  The pilot was designed to achieve the improved clinical and permanency outcomes \nidentified for the program by applying system of care principles premised on (i) localized control \nof interventions and supports through intensive Child and Family teams, (ii) use of flexible \nfunding for goods and services, and (iii) development of community and home based services.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. at 17.   \nProgram Design:  Children are referred to CHOICES in several ways, including in  non-\ncrisis and emergency circumstances by DCFS child protection investigators (if DCFS has \ntemporary custody) and by DCFS/POS permanency staff if the family meets the target \npopulation criteria.  In non-crisis circumstances, a referral form is sent to the DCFS Care \nCoordination Office (CCO) by the child welfare referral source to ensure that target population \neligibility is met, then the referral and accompanying releases/consents are sent via the \nDocument Transfer System to CHOICES staff.  In emergency situations, a crisis screening6 \n(mental health crisis) of a non-enrolled youth in care by the Mobile Crisis Response group is \nreported to the CCO through a list created by HFS.  The CCO reviews the case of the youth and \ndetermines whether the youth meets eligibility criteria.  If the youth is eligible for CHOICES \nenrollment, the CCO sends an e-mail with the CHOICES referral form, DCFS consent form and \nthe Choices consent form to the permanency worker.  The worker completes the documents and \nreturns the information to the CCO.  The CCO then forwards information to CHOICES \nstaff.   The list is provided to the CCO one time per month by HFS. \n                                                            \n6 A crisis screening occurs when a youth has a psychiatric crisis. Screenings occur within 90 \nminutes of the crisis call being reported to Crisis and Referral Entry Services (CARES) and the \nMobile Crisis Response group is dispatched.     \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 22 of 76 PageID #:1530\n   DCFS investigative staff and permanency staff can request emergency CHOICES \nenrollment for a child who meets eligibility requirements.  Examples of emergency requests may \ninclude children who enter care on based on dependency due to their mental health needs and \nplacement is required; children who need placement because a caregiver issued a 14-day notice \nfor removal of the child; and children who are approaching beyond medical necessity (BMN)  or \nmay be in BMN status during hospitalization for psychiatric concerns. \n  Immediately after crisis screening, youth enrolled in CHOICES have an emergency Child \nand Family Team Meeting (CFTM) with the youth, family members who are engaged in the \nteam (this includes foster parents and sometimes biological parents if their rights have not been \nterminated), formal and natural supports, the caseworker, and the Care Coordinator to revise the \nindividualized crisis safety plan and the plan of care.  Care Coordinators from the CME also \nfollow up with the family and bring the CFTM members together to review supports and \nservices. The initial Child and Family Teams meetings are scheduled within 30 days of the initial \nreferral if the child is not referred following an emergency event.  If a youth is referred following \nan emergency event, the Child and Family Team meeting is scheduled within one week of the \nreferral.  Exhibit H, CME Four Month Status Report, p. 4; Exhibit I, Care Management Entity \nCare Coordination through High Fidelity Wraparound PowerPoint, p. 5.  Additionally, the \naverage number of days between each Child and Family Team meeting is 30.3 days, which is a \nsignificantly better than the required number of days outlined in DCFS policies.7  Historically, \nthese CFTMs have not occurred on time and often do not include a youth and family’s full team \nof support. The CHOICES timeline ensures the Child and Family Team is engaged at significant \n                                                            \n7 DCFS procedure 315.105 states that permanency workers are required to have Child and \nFamily Team meetings 14 days after protective custody, then 40 days after protective custody to \nreview assessment documents and develop an initial service plan, then quarterly (approximately \nevery 90 days) thereafter. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 23 of 76 PageID #:1531\njunctures in a child’s life and with a level of frequency that solidifies the role of this team in \ndecision-making for the child. \nThe Provider Network:  The current Provider Network is comprised of providers who \nmay hold contracts either with DCFS and CHOICES, or solely with CHOICES.  There are a total \nof 76 unique providers in the Network.  Some providers may offer multiple services, and some \nhave single-service agreements for services with individual children.  The break-out of providers \nis as follows: \nBehavioral Health – 55 providers; 20 are CHOICES-only contracts \nBehavioral Support – 69 providers; 32 are CHOICES-only contracts \nSubstance Use – 11 providers; 3 are CHOICES-only contracts \nMentoring – 23 providers; 14 are CHOICES-only contracts \nSupervision Services – 28 providers; 4 are CHOICES-only contracts \nMedical Services – 27 providers; 0 are CHOICES-only contracts \nPlacement – 23 providers; 0 are CHOICES-only contracts \nRespite – 5 providers; 2 are CHOICES-only contracts \nSingle-Service Agreements for specific youth - 4 providers serving 8 youth \n \nExhibit J, CHOICES Provider Service Report.  The growth and development of the CME \ncommunity-based provider network has stabilized since service providers are being added to the \nCME network at a slower rate than in the past.  The provider network now  includes the range of \ntraditional and non-traditional providers needed by youth served by the pilot, with the exception \nof (i) family-based placements equipped to provide intensive treatment services; and (ii) \nindividualized supports for youth enrolled in the pilot, especially those placed in or at risk of \nbeing placed in congregate care settings.  Exhibit H, CME Four Month Status Report, p. 4.  \nThere is still some limited growth of the provider network, however, through single-service \nagreements with specific providers to support individual youth.  Id. \n  The primary resource gaps exist for youth at risk of entering congregate care or who are \nready to step down from congregate care settings.  CHOICES staff have experienced difficulty \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 24 of 76 PageID #:1532\nbuilding family care resources for youth who have experienced significant mental health or \nbehavioral dysregulation.  CHOICES staff working with children who are slated for discharge \nfrom congregate care settings encounter wait lists for placement options such as group homes, \ntransitional living placements and Community Integrated Living Arrangements.  The delay in \nstep down can be so long that youth age out of the eligibility criteria for their step down \nplacements and alternative placements have to be secured.  CHOICES staff have also \nencountered challenges working with congregate care providers when the Child and Family \nTeam believes a child is ready for step down, but the case management provider does not believe \nthe child is ready.  Currently, this is not consistently being addressed through the Non-Consensus \nResolution Process, which involves CHOICES staff elevating the review to the DCFS Clinical \nDivision, and holding the parties involved accountable to follow-through on the Clinical \nrecommendation. In order to make sure these situations are addressed through the Non-\nConsensus Resolution process, DCFS Clinical will follow-up to ensure the clinical \nrecommendations are implemented.    \n  Recently-Added Services:  Home-Based Clinical and Home-Based Support Services, \nwhich is a joint service between DCFS and HFS, was added after the Implementation Plan was \nentered.  It is a Medicaid reimbursable service available in the pilot area to youth who are \nenrolled in CHOICES.  This Home Based Clinical service is provided by master’s level \ntherapists using the Managing and Adapting Practice system to identify evidence-based practices \nthat would be effective given the demographics and symptomology of the individual youth. \nCurrently, there are nine service slots available.  The nine slots available are used selectively by \nCHOICES administration.  This includes consideration of children served by the CHOICES \nCME from the community who are not in care and children who are youth in care who are \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 25 of 76 PageID #:1533\nalready enrolled in CHOICES.  The criteria for use is to provide the service to children who are \nin need of it most, particularly youth who are at risk of being placed in congregate care settings \nor in juvenile detention centers. Currently one youth in care receives these services, and eight \ncommunity youth fill the other slots. \nNumber of Youth Served and Initial Outcomes:  From the time the program began in \nFebruary, 2014 through mid-January 2017, the CME has served 321 youth in care.  This strongly \nsuggests that the goal of serving 600 children by June, 2017, when the pilot concludes, will not \nbe met.  The current census is 143 youth in care; 52.4% of those youth are placed in traditional, \nhome of relative or fictive kin placements, 32.9% of those youth are placed in congregate care \nsettings, 3.5% are in detention, shelter, or hospitalization for psychiatric reasons, and 10.5% are \nplaced in specialized foster care placements.  Exhibit H, CME Four Month Status Report, p.1.  \nHowever, there are positive indicators for the program.  Monthly reports from CHOICES show \nover 90% of youth are participating in Child/Family Team Meetings on a monthly basis.  Client \nsatisfaction surveys reflect that at least 85% of youth and families felt satisfied or very satisfied \nthat their voice is heard and respected in Child/Family Team meetings.  Exhibit H, CME Four \nMonth Status Report, p. 5.    The data on actual outcomes to date for youth enrolled in CHOICES \ninclude:   \nForty-seven youth now enrolled in the CHOICES program reside in congregate care; \nThe March 2015 – February 2016 report for youth who were in congregate care at the \n  time of referral reflected a step-down rate of 15.5% at six months and 32.8% at 12 \n  months;  \n \nThe February 2014-December 2016 report shows that 36% of youth in congregate care \n  stepped down to a less restrictive setting within 12 months after their enrollment in \n  CHOICES; and  \n \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 26 of 76 PageID #:1534\nThe DCFS Supplemental Report for February 2014-December 2016 shows 45% of youth \n  in traditional foster care for 12 months were stable in one placement.  Similarly, 51% of \n  youth in specialized foster care were stable in the first twelve months of their enrollment.  \n  \nExhibit K, DCFS Supplemental Report for February 2014 through December 2016.   \n \n  Initial results from another service, Mobile Crisis Response, also appear to be promising.  \nThe Mobile Crisis Response program is for youth in care and youth in the community who are \nexperiencing behavioral health crises that may require hospitalization or may lead to them being \nremoved from their current placement.  Implementation Plan, pp. 16-17.  This service has been \noffered since April 2016.  Since April 2016, a total of 205 youth in care received Mobile Crisis \nResponse services.  Sixty-nine youth were enrolled in CHOICES and 136 youth were not \nenrolled in CHOICES.  Exhibit L, MCR Data.  \n First quarter data from September 2016 showed a reduction of psychiatric hospitalization \nrates immediately following a crisis for all community youth in the pilot counties, not just those \nenrolled in CHOICES, from an average of 50% for youth assessed by Screening Assessment and \nSupport Services (SASS) providers to 35% when screenings were completed by the pilot’s \nMobile Crisis Response.   Mobile Crisis events for DCFS youth decreased over the course of \ntwelve months after CHOICES enrollment: during those twelve months after enrollment, 13% of \nDCFS youth engaged the Mobile Crisis Response team at least one time; in months 1 through 6, \n8% of DCFS youth engaged in Crisis Response; in months 6 to 12, this reduced to 7%.  These \nreduced Mobile Crisis and hospitalization rates might be attributable to several factors, \nincluding,  regularly occurring CFT meetings, individualized crisis plans that are included in the \nyouth’s overall service plan and that are reviewed and revised when new risks are identified, \nimmediate access to care coordinator and other team members knowledgeable about the \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 27 of 76 PageID #:1535\nindividual youth’s needs and available supports, and individualized services in place for youth \nthat are designed to prevent and reduce crises.  \nIdentified Program Challenges:  The most significant challenges the Department has \nidentified in respect to the CME pilot are (i) the need for family-based placements equipped to \nprovide intensive treatment services and individualized supports for youth enrolled in the pilot, \nespecially those placed in or at risk of being placed in congregate care settings; and (ii) \npermanency workers’ resistance to the program.  The need for development of appropriately \nequipped and supported family-based placements was the primary reason cited by the Expert \nPanel for the “Needs Improvement” rating.  \nOther challenges include the contracting process, such as the length of time necessary to \ncomplete required background checks for providers and their employees, and concern from \nproviders regarding the amount of funds necessary to build new services and the sustainability of \nthose new services.  Exhibit H, CME Four Month Status Report, p. 4.  \nProgram Evaluation:  DCFS did not identify a comparison group for the CME \nevaluation in December 2016 as it had planned, and an interim evaluation will not be completed \nby March 2017.  One reason for the delay was due to the change in evaluators from Chapin Hall \nto the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  This change required the drafting of new data \nsharing agreements and the reconfiguration of hardware to access the necessary data.   \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \nAddressing Barriers to Success:  The project manager and supervisor have requested \nassistance from DCFS Associate Director Pete Digre to clarify expectations about supporting the \nCME pilot with DCFS state level and regional administrative staff.  State and regional \nadministrative DCFS staff are expected to serve as champions for the pilot, and to take the steps \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 28 of 76 PageID #:1536\nnecessary to ensure that DCFS and private providers focus on developing new family-based \nplacements and enhancing existing foster homes with supports and services that are available to \npotential foster parents through the CME.  DCFS will begin to address this at the next quarterly \nmeeting with the CME, private agency and DCFS administrative staff.  At that time project staff \nwill apprise private agencies and DCFS administrative staff of the specific service deficiencies in \nthe pilot and, with them, develop a plan to address the service gaps, specific service capacity \nneeds and timeframes for getting needed services in place.  \nIn addition, while most permanency workers and court personnel support the principles \nand services of the pilot, the CME continues to experience resistance from some permanency \nworkers to serve youth with intensive home and community-based services through the CME, \nrather than seeking more restrictive and congregate care settings for youth on their caseloads. \nThis challenge is to be expected when developing new community-based service systems and is \npart of the process to change worker mindset and the culture to support individualized, \ncommunity-based services. However, it is a challenge that must be overcome.  Project staff and \nthe CME will continue to enlist the support and action from agencies and workers that have \nmade the “sea change” in their mindsets and have experienced first-hand the improved outcomes \nfor youth served in the community.   \nDuring the next reporting period, the CME pilot will track the extent to which its actions \nwith DCFS regional staff, community stakeholders and providers have a positive outcome on the \nservices provided to youth in the pilot and the outcomes they achieve.  \nRenewed Focus on Step-Down Placements:  As part of the efforts identified above \nregarding resource development, a renewed focus will be placed on youth enrolled in the CME \nwho are placed in residential treatment facilities and need a step down placement. For those \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 29 of 76 PageID #:1537\nyouth, provider staff, working in conjunction with residential staff, will assess each youth’s \nneeds, convene a CFT meeting to identify the supports and services necessary for the child to be \nmoved and served in a community setting, and then implement the plan for needed services.  A \nbarrier to the step down of these youth is the lack of available foster homes that are willing to \ntake them, either because foster parents do not understand the level of individualized support and \nservices that are available through the CME pilot or because of gaps in service availability.  By \nthe next reporting period, DCFS will have implemented improved communication to foster \nparents regarding the services that can be provided through the CME.  In addition, pilot staff will \ndevelop a plan with specific targets and timeframes to increase the number of new foster homes \nin the pilot project area for step-down placements and to increase the pool of existing foster \nparents. \n  Court Outreach:  Vermillion County has a new presiding judge and additional outreach \nefforts will continue with the judge to provide an overview on the CME pilot and to solicit \nfeedback from the court and other stakeholders and supports for serving youth from Vermillion \nCounty in community-based settings. \n  Transition from Pilot to Ongoing Model:  During the next reporting period, the \nDepartment, along with pilot staff, will develop plans for continuing the services (e.g., contract \nrenewals, new contracts), along with targets and timeframes to accomplish the transition from a \npilot project to an ongoing care management model. \nCME Evaluation:  Now that the change in program evaluators has been accomplished, it \nis anticipated that a comparison group can be drawn from surrounding counties to the CME pilot, \nsuch as McLean, Macon, Piatt and Livingston Counties for purposes of the program \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 30 of 76 PageID #:1538\nevaluation.  The new target date for the evaluation is September 2017, though efforts will be \nmade to complete the evaluation before then. \nD.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Regenerations Pilot Project for Dually-Involved \nYouth at Cook County Juvenile Detention Center \n1.  Project Goals / Target:   \n \nThe Regenerations pilot is designed to provide placements and intensive services to \nDCFS youth in care who are also involved in the juvenile justice system and are ready for release \nfrom the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).  Implementation Plan, pp. 20-22.  The \nprogram, using two providers (Lutheran Child and Family Services (LCFS) and Youth Advocacy \nProgram (YAP), provides traditional mental health services, care coordination, foster care \nservices (if needed) and individualized home and community based services through a \nwraparound philosophy.  Id. The program goal was to serve 65 youth.  There was no deadline \nspecified in the Implementation Plan for reaching that level of service.   Implementation Plan, p. \n21.    \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.  \n \n3.          Status Report: Since its inception in July 2015, the pilot has served 67 \nyouth.  Eight youth were not placed: 6 were awaiting placement and 2 were listed as “N/A” \n(meaning that the Department has not yet identified a placement).  Of the 59 youth in the pilot \nthat were placed, 81% of those youth were placed in a family-like setting as opposed to \nresidential care.  Only 17% youth in the pilot were placed in a congregate care setting.  1%, or \none child, went to a transitional living placement. Most youth were placed in the homes of \nrelatives or specialized foster care placements.  Exhibit M, DCFS Regenerations Pilot, FY17Q2 \nFidelity Metrics Report and Information for January 5, 2017 Mid-Term Exam, pp. 4, 6.   \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 31 of 76 PageID #:1539\nThe services provided to the youth through the pilot included in-home supports, crisis \nintervention/response services, placement stabilization services, and educational and recreational \nactivities.  Moreover, YAP advocates work with the youth on a weekly basis and provide \nintensive one-on-one mentoring services, ranging from five to thirty hours per week, and \ndesigned around each youth’s particular need. Exhibit N, Regenerations January 2017 Updated \nStatus Report, p. 2.  \nDuring Fiscal Year 2016, the Regenerations/RUR Pilot implementation team, in \nconjunction with Chapin Hall, developed a logic model, program manual and components, \nimplementer responsibilities, fidelity metrics, target outcomes and an evaluation plan for the \nprogram.  Exhibit M, DCFS Regenerations Pilot, F12Q2 Fidelity Metrics Report and Information \nfor January 5, 2017 Mid-Term Exam, p. 1.   \nDCFS created a Regenerations/RUR Pilot Post-Placement SharePoint site to facilitate \ncase coordination of post-placement services between LCFS and YAP and to provide data for \nfidelity metrics and outcomes identified in the evaluation plan. Id.  The data that is to be \nprovided on the SharePoint site consists of providers’ reports regarding individual/family \ncounseling services, medication management services, youth employment hours, advocate \n(mentoring) hours provided, and any parent/child/sibling visits.  Exhibit M, F12Q2 Fidelity \nMetrics Report and Information for January 5, 2017 Mid-Term Exam, pp. 1-2.  \nThe SharePoint site is a less than ideal solution to managing data for the project.  The \nsystem is cumbersome, and as a result, the two provider agencies have struggled to maintain \naccurate and timely service data in SharePoint.  At present, however, the Department does not \nhave a better alternative.  The Department has clarified the data entry expectations and timelines \nwith the provider agencies.  An agreed-upon schedule has been developed for entering historical \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 32 of 76 PageID #:1540\ndata onto the Sharepoint site, while there is a weekly deadline by which current service data will \nbe entered there.  \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  Beginning in February 2017, DCFS will explore \noptions and implement specific strategies to ensure that the service data and the billing data for \nyouth served through the pilot project are reconciled.  \nThe current Regenerations Pilot will be moved from a pilot project to an ongoing DCFS \nprogram upon completion of the pilot in June 2017.  \nDCFS is analyzing how to expand the pool of service providers for dually-involved \nyouth.  In addition, recruitment of new traditional and other “specialized” foster homes equipped \nto serve dually-involved youth with co-occurring mental health and behavioral needs for youth in \nthe pilot is essential.  The Regenerations/RUR team will continue to develop strategies for the \nrecruitment of foster parents.  A plan for expansion of the foster parent resources necessary for \nthe program has been submitted by LCFS to DCFS.  Exhibit O, LCFS Foster Parent Recruitment \nPlan. DCFS will review the plan for expansion to ensure it meets the goals of recruiting \nadditional foster parents.  \nBased on the initial implementation of the pilot and the fact that many of the dually \ninvolved youth have been placed in community and other home based settings, DCFS is in the \nprocess of developing contracts for other agencies to provide similar services to dually involved \nyouth.  Those programs will be developed with four additional agencies, including Youth \nOutreach Services, National Youth Advocate Program, Youth Advocate Program and \nChildserve.  The services provided by these additional agencies for dually involved youth are \ncurrently scheduled to begin in the next reporting period.  \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 33 of 76 PageID #:1541\nBy the next reporting period, a target date will be set for incorporating Regenerations \ndata into the Mindshare platform.   The Department will run a test of some of the youth in the \nRegenerations pilot in the Mindshare platform by February 24, 2017.  Any necessary \nadjustments will be made after that test run and then all of the youth currently involved in the \nRegenerations pilot will be embedded into the Mindshare platform. The Department also will \nbegin tracking the outcomes for the children who have been served through the pilot to date, with \na particular focus on stability and safety.   \nE.  Panel Recommendation #1:  Illinois Pay for Success Pilot for Dually-Involved \nYouth  \n1.  Progress Goals / Target:   \n \nThe Illinois Pay for Success Pilot is designed to reduce recidivism and to increase \nplacement stability, educational achievements and employment opportunities for youth dually \ninvolved in the child welfare and juvenile justice system.  Implementation Plan, pp. 22-25.  The \npilot was to be funded through a social impact bond, by which private funds are used to pay for \nthe pilot services.  DCFS would not have an obligation to pay for services delivered through the \npilot unless it is clearly demonstrated that the services had a statistically significant impact on the \noutcomes of the youth enrolled in the program.  Service providers selected for the pilot joined \ntogether to form the Conscience Community Network LLC (CCN) to raise private funds for the \npilot and then deliver services for eligible youth. Implementation Plan, pp. 22-23.   \nThe Implementation Plan called for a Ramp Up phase (funded by separate foundation \nfunds) during which 50 youth would receive services.  After the Ramp Up phase a pilot was to \nbegin in or around September 1, 2016.  CCN was to raise $17 million in private funds by March \n31, 2017 to pay for the services that were to be provided during the pilot period. Expansion of \nthe pilot to three additional counties was to occur by March 2017. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 34 of 76 PageID #:1542\n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Needs Improvement.  \n \n3.          Status Report: Funding for the Ramp Up phase was secured.  Fifty children \nwere served during the Ramp Up phase, which began in January 2016 and continued until \nDecember 2016.  Exhibit P, Pay for Success Four Month Status Report, Dec. 29, 2016, p. 1.   \nThe start date of the pilot was delayed due to difficulties encountered during contract \nnegotiations which involved issues regarding each of the parties’ legal obligations under the \ncontract and to the finalization of the evaluation plan with the University of Michigan. The pilot \ncommenced on December 1, 2016 and intake began in January 2017.  Twelve youth currently are \nreceiving services as part of the pilot.   \nTo date, DCFS has identified two significant issues with the program.  First, there were \ndelays in inputting information into the Unusual Incident Reporting system, which serves as a \nmajor referral pathway to the Pay for Success pilot. The delays concerned the time between the \noccurrence of the incident and when the caseworker inputted the information into the Unusual \nIncident Reporting System.   In addition, there are problems with the communication path \nnecessary for appropriate caseworkers to partner with a Wrap Facilitator from the private agency \nsince caseworkers were not returning the calls from the facilitators.    Exhibit P, Pay for Success \nFour Month Status Report, December 29, 2016, p. 1. \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  CCN is in the midst of a fundraising period and has \nset a goal of raising $17 million by March 31, 2017.  Those funds are intended to cover the \nprojected cost of the pilot for four years of treatment (through March 2021) and three years of \nevaluation.  CCN will not enroll any more than 25 youth in Cook, Lake, Franklin and Jefferson \ncounties until after the fundraising deadline has passed.   Exhibit P, Pay for Success Four Month \nStatus Report, December 29, 2016, p. 1.   \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 35 of 76 PageID #:1543\nIf CCN’s fundraising goal is not met, DCFS at the least will enter into appropriate \ncontracts to continue serving youth already receiving services as part of the pilot.  The \nDepartment will also consider renegotiating the contract during the next reporting period.  CCN \nis a network among some of the state’s largest providers, and DCFS recognizes that the \nformation of a provider network with which it could contract for needed services has potential as \na model for the Department to bring together key providers under a single contract to provide \nspecific services, or services for small, but targeted populations (e.g., youth with sexually \naggressive behaviors, youth involved in human trafficking, parenting teens, dually-diagnosed \nyouth, youth on the autism spectrum).   \nOn the assumption that work with CCN will continue in some form, DCFS and CCN will \ncontinue to work to address the problems identified in the ramp up phase regarding \ncommunication issues and referral pathways.  By the next reporting period, if the program \nproceeds in some form, DCFS will resolve any delays in the UIR reporting.  CCN has already \ndeveloped a protocol tool for their management to reach out to management of the agency with \ncase management responsibility to work together in the pilot and rectify the communication \nissues. \nDCFS is also currently negotiating with the evaluation team from the University of \nMichigan to analyze data on the 50 youth that received services during the ramp up phase. \nRecommendation #2:  Create four “immersion sites” of small geographic areas that coincide \nwith judicial circuits to fully build, test and implement a core practice model that puts children \nand families at the center of service planning and builds community and home-based services for \nchildren and their families. (Implementation Plan at pp. 25-38).    \n \n  1.          Project Goals / Target:   \n \nImmersion Sites are test or pilot sites representing a small geographic area where youth, \nbirth parents, foster parents, DCFS staff, private agency staff and multiple other stakeholders \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 36 of 76 PageID #:1544\nwork together to fully build and implement a “core practice model” of child welfare practice that \nputs children and families at the center of service planning and builds community and home \nbased resources to service children and families.  DCFS intends to use Immersion Sites as the \ncenter of its transformation to improve safety, permanency and stability outcomes.  The \nDepartment identified the key components to the process as: \n(i)   training and coaching of all DCFS and private agency staff in the new Family-\nCentered, Trauma-Informed, Strength-Based Practice Model practice model for \nservice delivery (referred to here as “FTS”);  \n \n(ii)  implementation of a new “Model of Supervisory Practice” or “MoSP;”  \n(iii)  integration of its Quality Assurance Division and Monitoring Divisions in the \nimmersion sites in order to implement a new, Quality Service Review Process \n(QSR);  \n(iv)  development of community and home based services for children and families \nand securing Title IV-E waivers to fund same;  \n(v)   refinement of a data tracking system to measure outcomes for children;  \n(vi)  revision of coverage areas for DCFS offices to align them with the boundaries of \nthe State’s judicial circuits; and  \n(vii)   decentralization and internal, DCFS structural changes to improve case flow and \nday-to-day operational processes.   \nIn August 2016, before the time the Implementation Plan was filed, DCFS had begun the \nimmersion site process in four initial sites.8  The initial Immersion Sites encompass \napproximately 11% of children and youth in care.  Exhibit Q, Immersion Sites Four Month \nStatus Update, September through December 2016 (dated January 12, 2017).   \nThe Implementation Plan set out a series of target dates for the Immersion Site process.  \nDCFS intended to finalize Title IV-E waivers by September 2016 in order to secure out-of-home \n                                                            \n8 The four initial Immersion Sites are:  (1) Lake County, (2) St. Clair County, (3) the Rock Island \narea, including Rock Island, Whiteside, Mercer and Henry counties, and (4) the five counties in \nthe Mount Vernon area, including Clay, Hamilton, Jefferson, Marion and Wayne Counties. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 37 of 76 PageID #:1545\ncare funds to develop and build an intensive array of services in the immersion sties.  The \nDepartment planned to hold a summit to announce its new Core Practice Model (comprised of \nFTS and MoSP) in October, 2016.  For QSR, DCFS was to begin a review of the draft review \ntool by October 15, 2016, and the tool was to be finalized by the middle of November 2016. \nTraining required for use of the QSR tool (consisting of a two-day training session and two \nsubsequent, week-long mentoring sessions) was to be completed by January 30, 2017, and pilot \nuse of the QSR process was to begin in one immersion site by February 1, 2017, with the \nmentors on site during the initial reviews.  \nThe Department projected that it would take until September, 2017 to complete the \nprocess in the first four Immersion Sites.  Additional Immersion Sites then were to be rolled out \non a regular basis, with the immersion process to be completed throughout the entire state by \n2019.   \n2.           Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.       \n3.          Status Report:   \n \nThe Summit.  At a pre-Summit meeting on October 17, 2016, Immersion Site \nstakeholder leaders were informed of all FTS and CFTM training that would be conducted in \neach immersion site.  Then, with support from Casey Family Programs, the Department held its \nplanned, statewide Summit on October 17-19, 2016.  The Summit did not provide formal \ntraining for implementation of services, but served as the public launch of the Immersion Site \nmodel and provided extensive information on the Department’s new Core Practice Model \n(comprised of FTS, QSR, and MoSP) and the immersion goals and outcomes. Approximately \n900 people from across Illinois attended the Summit.  Summit participants were stakeholders \nfrom throughout child welfare including: DCFS, private child welfare agencies, the judiciary, \ncurrent and former youth in care, foster and birth families, members of the Illinois Children and \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 38 of 76 PageID #:1546\nFamily Services Advisory Council and members of CWAC committees, State’s Attorneys, \nGuardians ad Litem, Court Appointed Special Advocates, and public defenders. See Exhibit R, \nSummit Program and Agenda. The Summit included sessions regarding the FTS model and the \nchild and family team process.  \nFTS Training and Implementation.  Some progress has been made in providing the \nnecessary training for Immersion Sites.  The FTS training module is the prerequisite for all \nsubsequent training. The FTS training module has been completed by most required participants \nin the Immersion Sites.  The training was provided by a team of DCFS trainers.   Service \npersonnel were trained in person, and administrative and support personnel were trained via an \nonline module. As of January 2017, the following have been trained: \nTotal targeted participants    \nTotal participants who have \n83.02% \ncompleted FTS training \nTotal participants registered for \n8.02% \nupcoming FTS training \nTotal participants not completed \n12.31% \nor not registered \nTotal participants scheduled for \n4.66% \nself-directed learning \n \nExhibit Q, Immersion Sites Four Month Status Update, September through December 2016 \n(dated January 12, 2017), p. 14.  With the exception of some 50 staff scattered among the \nImmersion Sites, FTS training for all targeted participants in the Immersion Sites was completed \nin January 2017. Two make-up sessions are scheduled for February for staff who missed the \ntrainings and if necessary an additional session will be held in March. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 39 of 76 PageID #:1547\n  In addition, an abbreviated self-directed version of this FTS training has been in place \nduring the rollout for specific populations of staff who DCFS management identified as \nappropriate for more limited training.  This abbreviated self-directed version centers on outlining \nall three aspects of the practice model and discusses how those aspects interact together along \nwith practice to encompass how staff should be engaging and working with children, youth and \nfamilies.  \nBeyond the FTS training, all Immersion Site staff also must be trained in Procedure 315 \n(P315) (a permanency planning procedure that covers Child and Family Teams, Family Finding, \nFictive Kin, and State-funded Guardianship expansion).  Procedure 315 training was initiated \nwithin the immersion sites in January 2017.  \nMoSP Training. The Model of Supervisory (MoSP) training will include a combination \nof classroom training and individual coaching and is currently scheduled to begin in Immersion \nSites in October or November 2017.  \n  CFT / QSR Training and Implementation.  Under the Core Practice Model, quality \nassurance will be improved by use of the Quality Services Review (QSR) model to review cases, \nincluding onsite interviews to ensure family engagement and effective child and family teams.  \nThe purpose of the QSR is to determine whether the Department is appropriately addressing the \nneeds of individual children and assessing the performance of the service system in meeting \nindividual youth’s needs. The target population for QSRs is those youth who are placed outside \nthe home and have serious emotional or mental health needs. Four immersion site QSR \nreviewers have been hired.  The QSR instrument is being finalized and the reviewers received \ntheir initial two-day training on January 19-20, 2017.  DCFS currently anticipates that four \nrounds of review of the QSR pilots will be conducted by Child Welfare Group (CWG) in the \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 40 of 76 PageID #:1548\nspring of 2017 to ensure that the QSR review have fidelity to the QSR standards.   The plan also \nincludes that the QSR reviewers will have regular debriefings and case reviews with CWG to \nincrease their skills in facilitating the reviews.  DCFS’ goal is to have eight skilled QSR \nreviewers in place by May 2017.  \nDCFS is working with the CWG on a plan for the Child and Family Team training and \nthe current goal is for the CWG to provide training and coaching based on their proprietary \ncurriculum and model.   DCFS should receive the final training plan by February 28, 2017. The \ncontent of the training will focus on ways to engage and prepare families for an effective child \nand family team meeting and then how to effectively facilitate the meeting in such a way as to \nensure that the family and youth feel supported and empowered. The first cohort of trainings is \ncurrently scheduled for early March 2017 with coaching commencing two weeks after the \ntraining.  DCFS staff from the Office of Professional Development will meet with immersion site \nstakeholders and private agency administration staff to explain the training and coaching process \nand to encourage the identification of supervisors and staff to participate in the first training \ncohort.  \nCommunity /- In-Home Services and Title IVE.  The development and implementation \nof an intensive array of in-home services is under design in each immersion site.  Two \nImmersion Sites have developed their respective approaches: Mount Vernon is developing a lead \nagency approach integrating supervised reunification, Nurturing Parent Training, Intensive \nPlacement Support for both intact and reunifying families, 24/7 emergency response and the \nintensive Multi-Systemic Therapy program. Lake County is developing an intensive wrap around \napproach involving ARC (Attachment and Regulation Competency), Motivational Interviewing, \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 41 of 76 PageID #:1549\nTriple P parent training and 24/7 emergency access.  St. Clair County and Rock Island are \nworking to finalize their designs and anticipate doing so during the next reporting period. \nProgress also has been made in increasing the availability of funds to develop in-home \nservices in the Immersion Sites. DCFS has developed a process to allow the Immersion Sites to \nprovide emergency cash for housing to keep high-risk families and youth together (“Norman \nfunds”).  In addition, in January 2017, a Title IV-E waiver was authorized by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Children’s Bureau. Exhibit S, Title IV-E Waiver.  \nThe waiver provides additional funding to create and provide an array of intensive in-home \nevidence-based services.  The Title IV-E waiver removes the prior restriction on use of federal \nMedicaid funds solely for out of home care and now permits use of those funds to pay for in- \nhome services.   \nProgram Evaluation.   \nDCFS is developing its Mindshare system to track permanency outcomes and to track \nchild and youth well-being.   DCFS also has a daily production report which flags both the \nnumbers of children in shelter (currently at an all-time low of 30) and those that stay in shelter \nbeyond 60 days, as well as all youth in residential facilities, BMN youth, and RUR youth in \nCook County. All youth in residential facilities who are determined to be ready to be stepped \ndown are reviewed every two weeks and a special team works with their case managers to \nsupport the step down process. Over 550 youth have stepped down due to this process over the \npast two years, though the Department cannot yet report on their subsequent placements. RUR \nyouth are tracked weekly with data from Cook detention center; however, no data is readily \navailable for non-Cook youth. BMN youth are also tracked daily and special calls are conducted \nwith their case managers to move them to a non-hospital placement.  \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 42 of 76 PageID #:1550\nDCFS Output and Outcome data will be refined by ensuring its alignment with CFSR \nbusiness rules. The University of Illinois Child and Family Research Center, Chapin Hall and \nDCFS business rules will each be aligned with CFSR business rules to ensure consistency in \nmeasurement.  \nThe key outcomes listed below are also currently tracked.  All outputs and distal and \nproximal outcomes should be accessible by March 2017 for the next four months status report, \nincluding the entire array of data called for in the CWAC Child Well Being Study as follows:  \nSafety and Permanence \n1.  Maltreatment in foster care  \n2.  Repeat maltreatment \n3.  Child and Family Team Meetings \n4.  Supervised and Unsupervised Visits \n5.  Family Reunification within 5 and 12 months \n6.  Permanency within 12 months \n7.  Total permanency achievements by month and year to date \n8.  Placement moves \n9.  Time to achieve family reunification \n10. Intact service levels \n \nPermanency will be tracked by immersion site, by DCFS region, and statewide to assess \nprogress so that prompt corrective action can be taken. Results will be provided in the monthly \nreports to the Expert Panel. The assessment of the immersion site pilot by way of output and \noutcome data is now being modified to ensure alignment with federal CFSR business rules.  See \nExhibit T, Immersion Site Outcome Improvement Services; Exhibit U, Outputs and Outcomes \nfor Illinois Immersion Sites, B.H. Mid-Term (January 5, 2017).    \nDCFS Internal Change and Decentralization.  DCFS is taking initial steps toward \ndecentralization to allow regional decision-making in the Immersion Sites.  The matching for \nplacements of children and youth and for the case opening process has been de-centralized in all \nfour Immersion Sites.  DCFS has also transferred agency performance team monitoring to the \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 43 of 76 PageID #:1551\nregions to ensure better integration of public and private sector case flow and quality of work.  \nPlans are being developed to integrate clinical staff into the Immersion Site child and family \nteam process during the next reporting period to ensure that accurate, thorough and strength-\nbased assessments are developed for youth in care. These assessments will drive the \ndevelopment of individualized plans and the delivery of needed services for youth with serious \nmental health and behavioral needs. \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \nRoll-Out to New Sites:  It is too early to state with confidence whether the goal to roll \nout the Immersion Site process statewide by September, 2019.  The immersion site work over the \nlast four months, including DCFS’ consultations with the CWG  and Paul Vincent, have \nhighlighted the significant length of time needed to train stakeholders, improve child welfare \npractice in a sustainable way, and develop and sustain the array of intensive home and \ncommunity-based services youth need. The Department, in collaboration with the Expert Panel \nand Plaintiffs’ counsel, may adjust the timeline for adding new Immersion Sites for the \nremainder of the state.     \nFTS:  The handful of individuals who have not yet completed the initial FTS training \nwill be trained by March 31, 2017. Currently 9% of caseworkers in Immersion Sites have not \nbeen trained. Additional make ups will be held in February and if needed March to compete this \nfirst round of training. \nProcedure 315 Training:  The targeted timeframe for completion of P315 training for \nimmersion site staff is March 31, 2017.  DCFS Operations, Monitoring and Professional \nDevelopment staff are working to ensure that all other permanency and adoption staff, \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 44 of 76 PageID #:1552\nsupervisors and managers complete the Procedure 315 training by March 2017. Makeup sessions \nwill be scheduled in April 2017.      \n  MoSP:  The MoSP training is projected to begin in October/November 2017. The goal of \nthe MoSP training will be to train and coach supervisors on effective supervisory practices.  \n  CFT / QSR.  By March 15, 2017, DCFS will have finalized its plan for providing \nnational expert coaches through the CWG in each immersion site to develop DCFS capacity to \nconduct independent reviews of status indicators and system performance indicators for \nindividual youth (QSR) and to create and facilitate Child and Family Teams while coaching local \nstaff to facilitate CFTs (CFT training). Rounds of Child and Family Team training and \nfacilitation coaching are scheduled to begin in March 2017 and will culminate when the Child \nWelfare Group certifies that DCFS staff have demonstrated the skills and ongoing capacity to \nfacilitate effective CFTs and to coach others in the principles and practices of effective CFTs.  \nThe targeted projected completion date is November 2017. At that time, it is anticipated that \nDCFS will have a core group of certified trainers and coaches in each immersion site to carry on \nthe work of CFT training with the support of periodic fidelity reviews from the Child Welfare \nGroup.  \nCommunity / In-Home Services:  DCFS plans to have a contract program plan and \nbudget in place for community / in-home services in each Immersion site by March 1, 2017 with \nan implementation date of April 1, 2017. The designs for the programs to be used in St. Clair \nCounty and Rock Island will be completed by March 1, 2017.  Contract program plans and \nbudgets will be in place in those sites by the next reporting period.    \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 45 of 76 PageID #:1553\nThe DCFS Clinical Division will guide development and implementation of in-home \nservices once the contracts for each Immersion Site are in place in April.  DCFS is working on \nprojections of the number of children who will be receiving these services by immersion site.    \nThe Administration for Children and Youth has asked DCFS for its detailed plan for \nimplementation of the IV-E waiver by April so it will be presented in the next four month status \nreport. The impact of the IV-E waiver is to give DCFS discretion over the use of these federal \nfunds so they will be a portion of the funding for these in-home services along with Medicaid.   \nDCFS will develop a plan for use of the Title IV-E waiver during the next reporting period.  \nRealignment of Office Areas:  Considerable progress has been made in developing a \nplan for realignment of DCFS Offices and Regions so that they will match the boundaries of \nassociated Judicial Circuits.  It is anticipated that the plan will be ready for the Director’s review \nand Union negotiations by March 31, 2017. \nDecentralization / Structural Change:  During the next reporting period, DCFS will \ntake the following steps toward decentralization to allow regional decision-making in the \nImmersion Sites:  (i) retool the current Integrated Assessment process to make it timely and \nconcise; (ii) transform the CIPP process into the CFT process; (iii) delegate to the CFT team the \nprocess of matching children with placements and deciding  which cases should have active and \ncontinuing clinical involvement in the CFT process from the beginning to the end of the life of \nthe case. This plan will be implemented in the Immersion Sites by April 30, 2017, and a plan for \nstatewide implementation will be presented in the next Four Month Status Report.  \n   \nPanel Recommendation #3:  Fund a set of permanency planning initiatives to improve \npermanency outcomes for adolescents who enter state custody at age 12 or older either by \ntransitioning youth to permanent homes or preparing them for reconnection to their birth families \nreaching adulthood.  (Implementation Plan, pp. 38-42).   \n \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 46 of 76 PageID #:1554\nDCFS is pursuing two initiatives in accordance with this Recommendation – the Fictive \nKin State Funded Guardianship, and Family Finding.  Each initiative has been separately graded \nby the Expert Panel and each is discussed separately below. \nA.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Amended Definition of “Fictive Kin”  \n \n1.  Project Goals/Target  \n \n  The Implementation Plan contemplates that amendments to expand the definition of \nfictive kin will improve permanency options and lead to improved well-being.    DCFS \ncommitted to updating its administrative rules with the expanded definition of fictive kin after \nJanuary 1, 2017, the effective date of the statutory change to the Children and Family Services \nAct.  Implementation Plan, pp. 39-40.  \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.  \n \n3.   Status Report: Effective January 1, 2017, amendments to the Children and \nFamily Services Act expanded the definition of fictive kin to include “a current foster parent if \nthe child has been placed in the home at least one year and has established a significant and \nfamily-like relationship with the foster parent.”  In anticipation of that change, on June 6, 2016, \nDCFS had issued Policy Transmittal 2016.06 advising staff of the amendment to the definition of \nfictive kin.  DCFS is updating various administrative rules, including DCFS Rules 300, 301, 302, \n304, 309, 315, 328, 337, 338, 359 and 402 with the updated definition of fictive kin.  On \nFebruary 2, 2017, DCFS filed these rule revisions with the Secretary of State for publication in \nthe Illinois Register on February 17, 2017, triggering the time for First Notice.  Exhibit V, \nExemplar Pages of Rule Changes.   \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 47 of 76 PageID #:1555\nDCFS has commenced training DCFS staff on Procedure 315, Permanency Planning, \nwhich includes training the expanded definition of fictive kin.9 The training involves two days in \nthe classroom and is occurring throughout the state. The status of this training is described in \ngreater detail at p. 43.  The first cohorts for training will include managers and supervisors in \nImmersion Sites.  Once all DCFS and POS Permanency staff are trained, the Office of \nProfessional Development will develop a shortened version of Procedure 315 to provide to intact \nand investigation staff.  The training will focus on the components that affect all aspects of \npermanency.   \nDCFS has been tracking placements with fictive kin.  From January 1, 2015, when the \ndefinition of relative was first expanded to include fictive kin in the Children and Family \nServices Act, to December 31, 2016, there were 1236 youth placed with fictive kin.  Exhibit W, \nFictive Kin Data.  Data sets for fictive kin are being embedded in the Mindshare platform.  These \ndata sets will distinguish between placements with fictive kin under the old, narrower definition \nof ‘relative,’ prior to the change on January 1, 2015 with those who meet the new expanded \ndefinition of ‘relative.’ \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  \nDCFS will continue tracking placements and outcomes of youth in fictive kin homes to \ndetermine if there is increased stability and permanency from January 2017 forward.  \nTraining for Procedure 315 for DCFS staff will begin in March 2017 and will be \ncompleted by all DCFS and private agency staff.  Exhibit X, Procedure 315 Training Schedule.   \nTraining for Procedures 315 for Investigation and Intact staff will begin in June of 2017. \nB.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Expanding State Funded Guardianship \n                                                            \n9 Training on fictive kin is part of the Procedure 315 training that is mandated for all DCFS and \nprivate agency staff statewide.  \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 48 of 76 PageID #:1556\n1.         Project Goals/Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplates that DCFS will \namend its administrative rules to expand the eligibility for state funded guardianship.  DCFS \ncommitted to completing the amendments by December 2016. Implementation Plan, p. 39. \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory. \n3.          Status Report:  DCFS issued Policy Guide 2016.09 on August 24, 2016 which \nannounced changes to Rule 302.410 to amend the eligibility criteria for state funded \nguardianship. The changes expanded eligibility criteria for state funded guardianship by: (i) \nlowering the age of eligible youth to 12 years of age from 14 years of age; and (ii) including \nlicensed and unlicensed relatives as placements eligible for the program.  On February 15, 2017, \nDCFS filed amended Rule 302.410 with the Secretary of State for publication in the Illinois \nRegister on March 3, 2017, triggering the time for First Notice. \nDCFS has already expanded the responsibilities of Adoption Specialists presently \nassigned to each private agency to include (i) review of all cases with guardianship goals, (ii) \nprovision of technical assistance to determining which youth are eligible for the state funded \nguardianship, and (iii) addressing the guardianship option with the foster parents.  This process \nbegan in August of 2016 and is still in effect. \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  \n            On March 3, 2017, First Notice for Rule 302.410 will be published in the Illinois \nRegister.  \nDCFS is developing a dashboard in the Mindshare platform that will allow program \nmanagers to be able to identify youth eligible for specific subsidies like the state funded \nguardianship program in order to move them to permanency.  Exhibit Y, New BH Related Data \nElements in Mindshare Dashboard – M02 – Children Active in Foster Care.  The target date for \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 49 of 76 PageID #:1557\ndevelopment of the Mindshare dashboard will be determined by the Expert Panel and Parties.  \nOnce that is in place, DCFS will review those youth who may be eligible for the new state \nfunded guardianship program.  Once those youth are identified, their names will be provided to \ntheir assigned case manager and supervisor to explore if the youths’ current permanency goal \nshould be changed to state-funded guardianship. The permanency worker and supervisor will \ndocument the discussion and will change the goal when appropriate.  \nDCFS Regional Administrators, through regular staff meetings and other staffings, will \nwork to ensure that all staff are advised of the expanded eligibility for state-funded guardianship, \nthat cases are reviewed to determine eligibility for state funded guardianship, and that \ncaseworkers are discussing the revised eligibility criteria with all eligible families.  A staff \nmeeting in the Central Region in scheduled for February 17, 2017, Southern Region is scheduled \nin early March 2017 and the Northern region is scheduled for February 27, 2017. The Cook \nCounty Meeting with Regional Administrator will be held by the end of March 2017. Fictive Kin \nwill also be addressed at each regional meeting.  \nDCFS will add questions to the Administrative Case Review (ACR) packet regarding \neligibility for both state funded guardianship and the KinGAP program, which is a federally \nfunded reimbursement program for guardians, by end of April 2017.  During the next reporting \nperiod, ACR staff will be instructed to raise the issue of eligibility for state funded guardianship \nduring each ACR and to document that discussion in their feedback. The ACR staff will \nadditionally discuss with the permanency staff the youth’s current placement type and determine \nif Fictive Kin was explored as a placement option.    \n \n \n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 50 of 76 PageID #:1558\nC.  Panel Recommendation # 3:  Family Finding     \n \n1.  Project Goals/Target: The Implementation Plan requires DCFS to implement \nspecific “family finder” strategies as part of permanency planning for adolescents who do not \nhave an obvious reunification plan. Implementation Plan, p. 40.  The goal of the Department’s \nFamily Finding strategy is to improve permanency outcomes for all youth by identifying family \nthat can serve as potential placements, supports or resources for youth.  Implementation Plan, pp. \n40-42.  \nDCFS committed to revising its rules and procedures to enhance family findings efforts \non all levels and that family finding efforts will be conducted for all children and youth entering \ncare with a return-home goal. The revised rules and procedures will require all child protection, \nintact and permanency staff to seek out non-custodial parents, relatives and fictive kin when \nplacing a child or youth.  DCFS further committed to requiring Permanency Achievement \nSpecialists within each DCFS region to conduct family finding tasks, and that these Specialists \nwould be available to both DCFS and private agency staff to provide technical assistance on \ncomplex or difficult cases to identify barriers to permanency through methods of file mining, \nfamily meetings, trainings or other assistance. Training on family finding was to be provided to \nDCFS staff and private agency staff and administrators.      \n Additionally, the Plan states that ACR staff will flag cases where family finding is not \noccurring or where there is a barrier to permanency so that DCFS and private agency staff can be \nmade aware of the issues and take steps to rectify the problems.   \nNo dates for the above commitments were specified in the Implementation Plan. \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Unsatisfactory   \n  3.          Status Report:   \n50 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 51 of 76 PageID #:1559\n            DCFS revised Procedures 315, Permanency Planning, to include family finding \nactivities.  Exhibit Z, Policy Transmittal 2016. 11: Procedures 315 Permanency \nPlanning.  Training on Procedure 315 of all DCFS and POS permanency staff began in February \n2016. Based upon feedback from the initial training cohort, the training was revised.  \nImplementation Plan, p. 42.  \nACR began requesting documentation to show completion of Family Finding activities by \nthe permanency worker at every ACR since August of 2016. If no documentation is provided to \nthe ACR reviewer, notification is then sent via the ACR Alert feedback to appropriate parties to \naddress. This allows for the supervisor to address the lack of family finding efforts in \nsupervision. This is completed at every ACR regardless of past compliance of the activity.  \nQuestions regarding family finding efforts also are being been added to the ACR review \npacket. The revisions to this packet are pending review for approval. The addition of this \nquestion will show compliance of Family Finding activities being completed from a statewide \nlevel.   \n            4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  The current goal is by the end of the next reporting \nperiod, DCFS will have identified and implemented steps to refocus its family finding efforts on \nadolescents with emotional and behavioral health needs to locate additional placements or \nsupports for these youth. \nTraining on Procedure 315 re-commenced in its revised format in December 2016 and is \nexpected to be completed by March 31, 2017.  Exhibit X, DCFS Training Schedule for \nProcedures 315.  \n  Additionally, a webinar which provides more in-depth instruction on the theory of family \nfindings is being finalized.  Exhibit AA, Family Finding Four Month Status Report, p. 7.  The \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 52 of 76 PageID #:1560\nWebinar will be available by March 15, 2017. The training is geared to all Permanency and \nInvestigation staff as Family Finding is required for all youth in care. The required timeframe for \ncompletion will be 60 days post-release to the DCFS Virtual Training Center. Anticipated date of \nstaff completion of this training is May 30th, 2017. The training will continue to be available for \nnewly hired staff and will be part of the required training. \n DCFS is developing a Mindshare platform dashboard to track family finding data and \nhas identified an outline of information to be included in that dashboard.  The dates for \ndevelopment of the Mindshare dashboard will be developed by the Expert Panel and Parties.  See \ndiscussion at pp. 14-15 supra.   \nPanel Recommendation #4:  Retain an organizational consultant to aid the Department in \n“rebooting” a number of stalled initiatives that are intended to address the needs of children and \nyouth with psychological, behavioral or emotional challenges” (Implementation Plan, pp. 42-43).  \nRecommendation #4 addresses two points - DCFS reorganization, and “rebooting” stalled \ninitiatives intended to meet the needs of specific youth.  The Department identified two \ninitiatives that needed to be “rebooted.”  The Department’s reorganization and those two \nprograms – Birth to Three (IB3) and Safe Families for Children (SFFC) – are discussed below.  \nIn addition, DCFS identified various IT projects, including updating or expanding certain \ninformation systems and applications and implementing a data analytics system intended to alert \ninvestigators of children at exceptionally high risk of serious harm or death, as part of its \nresponse to this Recommendation.  Those projects are also addressed below.  \nA.  Expert Panel Recommendation # 4:  Reorganization \n1.  Project Goals / Target: The Implementation Plan called for the Department to \ncreate a high level unit with cross-organization authority to develop an implementation plan, \nmanage the implementation and resolve system barriers. It also noted that the organizational \nconsultant should evaluate the organizational structure and culture of DCFS; the effectiveness of \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 53 of 76 PageID #:1561\nDCFS’ policies, procedures and programs; the effectiveness of the Department’s leadership and \nmanagerial structure and function and to assess the supervisory functions of the agency.  \nImplementation Plan at pp. 42-43.   \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Exemplary     \n3.          Status Report:  By the time the Implementation Plan was filed with the Court, \nDCFS already had undertaken a reorganization. Director Sheldon had obtained approval for a \ndepartmental reorganization of leadership and managerial structure from the Illinois Civil \nService Commission. The final organization structure was implemented in October 2015.  \nAccordingly, the need for an organizational consultant was deemed moot. \nSince the Department’s initial reorganization, additional refinement has occurred. The \nDepartment realigned several units and reassigned senior staff as implementation of the \nImmersion Site pilots and the strategic plan is underway. Exhibit BB, Director’s Announcement \nRe: Reorganization, dated January 17, 2017; Exhibit CC, Organizational Chart.  Pete Digre is the \nAssociate Director responsible for all the Implementation Plan initiatives, including the \nImmersion Sites.  In recognition of the need to integrate clinical expertise into the front-line \nwork of the Department, Mr. Digre also is now responsible for the Division of Clinical and \nProgram Development, residential monitoring and Medicaid behavioral health.  Further, Neil \nSkene, currently the Deputy Chief of Staff, is now Senior Deputy Director for Strategy and \nPerformance. This division combines program assessment, innovation and planning, professional \neducation, and engagement with stakeholders.  Michael Ruppe remains Senior Deputy Director \nfor Operations, responsible for Child Protection and Permanency and the DCFS Regional \nAdministrators.  The Operations division has been modified to now include Agency Performance \nTeams, which will report to Regional Administrators, Resource and Recruitment, and the Case \n53 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 54 of 76 PageID #:1562\nAssignment and Placement unit.  The Child Intake and Recovery Unit will be part of Operations \nand move under the umbrella of Permanency, led by Diane Cottrell. These structural changes \nfurther the goal of regionalization by integrating more functions into operations and into local \ncommunities.  \nThe Implementation Plan states that Pete Digre, Strategic Planning, and Project Managers \nwill meet weekly and report to during bi-weekly supervision meetings; that Project Managers \nwill support and collect reports from each university or external partner at least quarterly as well \nas ensure compliance with the four-month implementation plan status reports; and that Project \nManagers are responsible for tracking data and outcomes for each initiative and for supporting \nconsistent evaluation of success, progress and lessons learned in conjunction with the contracted \nexpert support and other members of the Strategic Planning team.  Implementation Plan at p. 43.    \nThose activities are ongoing.   \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  None at this time.  \nB.  Panel Recommendation # 4:  Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) \n  1.  Project Goals / Target:   \n  The Illinois Birth Thru Three (IB3) is a five-year federal demonstration project that \nbegan in 2012 that the Department still intends to complete within the originally contemplated \ntimeframe. The project provides two evidence-based interventions, singly or in combination – \nChild Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) or Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) – to parents and \nchildren in Cook County, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility, in order to reunify children with \ntheir parents more quickly and reduce the risk of re-entry to the child welfare system.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 22-26. \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.    \n54 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 55 of 76 PageID #:1563\n  3.          Status Report:  The IB3 project is in the fourth year, with one year remaining \nfor the five-year demonstration project.  There are currently 1704 children assigned to the \ndemonstration and eight agencies that provide the evidence-based interventions.  Exhibit DD, \nIB3 Four Month Status Report, p. 2.   \nCurrent challenges include maintaining sufficient and credentialed staff at the agencies \nproviding the services and continued engagement of parents.10    Specifically, current data for the \nChild Parent Psychotherapy demonstrates that 125 cases have been closed across the lifetime of \nthe project, but only 24% of the cases have been closed successfully.  The remaining 76% of the \ncases were discharged from the waiver program due to engagement challenges.  Similar evidence \nexists for the NPP.  Thirty-eight percent of the birth parents that are referred for the NPP \nprogram complete the program and approximately one third of the birth parents enroll in the NPP \nprogram several times before successfully completing NPP.  Exhibit DD, IB3 Four Month Status \nReport, pp. 4-6.   \nTo address parental engagement issues, the IB3 staff developed a model of on-site field \nsupport at agencies to be held several times a week to increase parental engagement with the \nintervention.  Implementation support specialists are now assigned to specific agencies.  Specific \nDCFS offices and agencies have been targeted for a case status reviews and permanency plans \nfor IB3 involved families. \n  The Implementation Support team has increased its capacity from 1.5 to 3 \nimplementation support specialists. Thus, the first quarter of the fiscal year focused on \ndeveloping and implementing an initial onboarding plan. The target date of October 2016 for \nintroducing the new staff and beginning implementation support in agencies was met. A few new \n                                                            \n10 For example, one agency lost a clinical director and two facilitators and another agency, which \nresumed their role as a provider, had to get new staff trained.   \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 56 of 76 PageID #:1564\nstructures were introduced, including the assignment of Implementation Support specialists to \nspecific intervention agencies. Implementation Support also worked toward a model which \ninvolves having onsite field support at agencies on a monthly basis. This new structure began at \nCook Central as a result of implementation support receiving an open invitation from the Area \nAdministrator to attend the supervisor meeting that occurs the first Tuesday of every month. This \napproach to onsite coaching is currently in 5 of the 10 intervention agencies.  \n  Field coaching still is largely targeted to foster care staff. However, the Implementation \nSupport team has strategically enhanced the engagement of agency licensing staff this year. The \nframework that was developed to support the process of implementation support is the main tool \nutilized by the Implementation Support specialists. The primary area of focus with supervisors \nand caseworkers has been permanence. During the meetings with agency staff, case status \nreviews are conducted, and those case updates are being used to guide engagement/ planning. \nImplementation Support specialists have met with approximately 166 agency staff and obtained \nthe status of 410 families recommended for the interventions. It remains challenging to educate \nmost agencies and courts regarding evidence-based interventions, the skill of engagement, and \nembracing the reality that infants and toddlers are affected by trauma exposure. While practice \ntraining modules are not yet in use, but Implementation Support continues to provide \neducation/coaching in the areas of engagement, court testimony on progress of evidence-based \ninterventions, and trauma-informed supervision.   \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \n  The Department will complete the pilot as scheduled by September 30, 2017.  \nImplementation support staff will provide support for 10 agencies that provide casework services \nto children enrolled in the IB3 program by 10% in an effort to improve engagement. \n56 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 57 of 76 PageID #:1565\nReunification and Overall Permanency Rates for Infants and Toddlers (Under 4 years old) who \nentered care between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2015 \n  \nProximal Outcome  Intervention  Comparison \nSignificance and Explanation \n(per Proximal Outcome  Group  Group \nof Difference \nin Logic Model)  (%, N)  (%, N) \nThe higher rate of reunification \nfor intervention cases (+3.5) \n   16.6%, 483  13.1%, 457  does not exceed the statistical \nReunification  17.0% 483  13.3%, 457  threshold of significant difference \nfrom 0 but is trending in the \nexpected direction (p < .139) \nThe higher rate of permanence \nby adoption, guardianship or \nreunification for intervention \n23.0%, 483  19.3%, 457  cases (+3.7) does not exceed \nOverall Permanence \n23.6%, 483  19.7%, 457  the statistical threshold of \nsignificant difference from 0 but \nis trending in the expected \ndirection (p < .162) \n*Top row as of December 2016; bottom row as of February 2017. \n  \nC.  Recommendation # 4:  SAFE Families for Children (SFFC)   \n  1.  Project Goals / Target:  The core objectives of SFFC include deflection of youth \nfrom child welfare custody, child abuse prevention, and family support and stabilization. The \nefficacy of the program cannot be evaluated until there are a total of 475 families in the control \ngroup and 475 families in the comparison group. Host families are volunteers and receive no \ncompensation for providing care for a child.  A parent retains all rights to make decisions for \ntheir child while in a Safe Families host home. SFFC also provides mentors and family coaches \navailable to work with the parents and family towards reunification and ongoing stabilization of \nthe family unit.  SFFC’s focus is to reunify families and make them stronger and more successful \nand resilient.  (Implementation Plan, pp. 46-47).    \n57 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 58 of 76 PageID #:1566\nDCFS’ goal for this program is to reexamine and modify the process for engaging \nfamilies in SFFC so that the evaluation can be completed.  SFFC has been in place in northern \nIllinois for over ten years and was expanded statewide in approximately October 2015.  \nImplementation Plan, pp. 44-46.  Nevertheless, participation in the program has lagged far \nbehind expectations. \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.   \n  3.          Status Report:   \nWhile the pilot design requires 475 families referred by DCFS and 475 from a control \ngroup, only 227 referrals have been made to the pilot between October 1, 2014 to September 15, \n2015.   This represents the total cases randomly identified and allocated to both the experimental \nand control group. Exhibit EE, SAFE Familes Four Month Status Report, p. 1.  The evaluators \noriginally hoped for 120 referrals from DCFS each quarter, however, in July 2016, that target \nwas revised to 60 referrals from DCFS per quarter and a secondary computerized referral \nmechanism was added at SFFC.    In the quarter from October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, \nwhich was last quarter for which there is data, there were 80 referrals to the program in total: 35 \ncases were identified through DCFS and 45 were identified by SFFC.  Id. at p. 1.   The \nevaluation period was extended for two years.  \nIdentified challenges for the program are being addressed.  One challenge concerned \nfamilies that failed to follow through with the referral to SFFC.  Administrative staff from SFFC \nnow have access to SACWIS and are making individual contacts with families that have been \nreferred to the program.  DCFS also held information sessions for frontline staff at DCFS offices \nwith the fewest referrals to identify whether there are problems with caseworker non-\nparticipation, which is another barrier DCFS had identified for this program.  DCFS is also \n58 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 59 of 76 PageID #:1567\naddressing the challenge presented by duplication of referrals from DCFS’ computerized referral \nsystem and SFFC’s system.  DCFS now provides SFFC with a daily report of referrals for \ncomparison and along with the SACWIS access; a SFFC administrator is able to review cases \nand prevent duplicate referrals. Duplicate referrals resulted in families being assigned to both the \ncontrol and experimental groups.  This “flipping” of assignments impacts the integrity of the \nevaluation and the ability to determine the success of Safe Families in preventing children \ncoming into foster care. \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  SFFC administrative staff will continue to make \nindividual contact with families referred to the program for the purpose of increasing family \nengagement and participation. By the next reporting period, DCFS also will determine how to \ntrack family engagement and whether to create a specific referral form to assist with tracking.  \nBy that same deadline, SFFC will decide whether an expansion of the program is needed to \nbetter serve the first cohort of Immersion Sites and what that expansion should entail. A meeting \nis being set for March 2017 with the professional evaluators, Safe Families staff and DCFS to \ndetermine next steps regarding non-participation by DCFS staff, current issues, needs for \ncontinued education and efforts surrounding expansion.  As of February 1, 2017, as a first step, \nAssociate Deputy for Child Protection is informed of the names of DCFS staff who do not \nrespond to Safe Families inquiries regarding the status of a referred family so that proper action \nis taken.  \nD.  Panel Recommendation # 4:  Information Systems   \n  1.  Project Goals / Target:   \n  The Implementation Plan requires DCFS to take a number of steps to enhance or replace \ndata systems to generate more timely, accurate and complete data.   \n59 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 60 of 76 PageID #:1568\nShort term goals, with a targeted completion between March and September 2017, \ninclude enhancement of the existing SACWIS system to accept educational data provided by \nISBE and unusual incident reporting from private agencies, as well as improvements in mobile \ntechnology through a mobile application for caseworkers, on-line foster parent licensing \napplication, and a tablet application for licensing site inspections.  Implementation Plan, pp. 48-\n52. \nLong-term goals, with a targeted completion date of September 2019, are replacement of \nthe existing SACWIS system, and implementation of predictive analytics. Implementation Plan, \npp. 48-52. Regarding predictive analytics, DCFS committed to establishing an internal team in \nOITS to bring reporting needs and data analytics into a centrally managed organization. In the \nshort term, DCFS elected to use Mindshare as the platform for its data analytics.  This product \nallows DCFS to merge and analyze data from multiple environments and produce reports for \nmore informed decision making in a dashboard format.  Ultimately, DCFS intends to establish a \nstatewide enterprise data analytics platform (“Enterprise IT”) to reduce reliance on external \nentities to collect and analyze data to drive outcomes. Implementation Plan, pp. 49-51.  \nAchievement of that goal is not anticipated until December 2018.   \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.   \n  3.          Status Report:   \nReplacement of SACWIS:  On November 29, 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services Administration for Children and Families (ACF) approved DCFS’ “Planning \nAdvance Planning Document.” This federally approved plan allows DCFS to develop a request \nfor proposal (RFP) for a feasibility study to replace SACWIS by migrating to a new \n“Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System” to replace SACWIS.  The approval permits \n60 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 61 of 76 PageID #:1569\nDCFS to receive federal matching funds for the feasibility study through December 2017.  \nExhibit FF, Information Technology/CCWIS RFP BH Status Report; Exhibit GG, November 29, \n2016 Letter from Commissioner Rafael Lopez to Director George H. Sheldon. \n  Short Term Improvement of Existing SACWIS:  DCFS is replacing the current \n“Unusual Incident Reports” with a newly developed Significant Event Report system.  A major \naspect of the new system is the ability to record UIR information directly into SACWIS.  Exhibit \nHH, Information Technology BH Status Report, p. 6.  DCFS and private agencies have been \nreceiving training on the new system.  \n  DCFS Information Technology System staff continues to meet with staff from the State \nBoard of Education regarding integration of educational data into SACWIS.   DCFS needs to \ndetermine the data elements required from ISBE which demonstrate improved well-being for \nchildren and decide if this information should be stored by DCFS or accessed on demand by case \nworkers.   Exhibit HH, Information Technology Projects BH Status Report, p. 6.    \n  Mobile Applications:  DCFS is the first state agency in Illinois to develop and use an \ninteractive mobile app for casework activity.   The mobile app allows staff to upload contact, \ncase notes and photographs directly into SACWIS.  Notes for contacts with family members can \nbe typed in on the iPhone or can be dictated into the Talk to Text feature on the iPhone.  The \nnotes created either in the app or on SACWIS can be edited within the app until they have been \ncompleted.  The app also displays the last three months of contact or case notes.  Photographs are \ntaken and uploaded within the app simultaneously. Exhibit II, DCFS Mobile Application User \nGuide.   \n  DCFS began the mobile app pilot in January, 2016, and it concluded on April 29, 2016.  \nThe program then was expanded statewide.  As of January 2017, iPhones with the SACWIS \n61 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 62 of 76 PageID #:1570\napplication have been provided to approximately 927 DCFS child protection and permanency \nstaff.    In December 2016, DCFS implemented PIWIK, an analytic platform that allows DCFS \nto track real-time data usage of the mobile app.   DCFS data demonstrate that while there are still \nsome challenges with the app, when it is used the case and contact notes are input at least 20% \nfaster.  Exhibit JJ, SACWIS Mobility Statistics/Usage State Roll-Up January 2017.     \n  DCFS also created an on-line licensing application for foster homes.  A controlled roll-\nout of the licensing application commenced which includes DuPage, Bloomington, McLean, \nLivingston, Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford counties.  Licensing staff in those counties will \ndirect interested individuals to the on-line application, but will also take a paper application as \nwell.  DCFS has received 28 online applications to date.     \nPredictive Analytics  \nThe predictive analytics project developed by Mindshare, which identifies investigations \nwith the highest probability of serious injury or death for children known to the Department, \nbegan on May 16, 2016.  Exhibit KK, Eckerd Rapid Safety Feedback Update, October-\nDecember 2016.  The Eckerd Rapid Safety Feedback Model began in Florida and has been used \nin other jurisdictions to help decrease poor outcomes (child deaths and serious harm). The \nprogram identifies the children at the highest risk, and then involves a review process that \nfocuses on nine critical practices to support child safety.  Exhibit LL, DCFS Announcement \nEckerd Rapid Safety Feedback Model.   \n  Trained reviewers from the DCFS Division of Quality Assurance and Research began \nwork on the predictive analytics project in May 2016.  The project focused on investigations \ninvolving children ages 0 to 18 years who were known to the Department that were at high risk \nof death or serious injury within 12 months.   In early September, DCFS further  narrowed the \n62 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 63 of 76 PageID #:1571\nfocus to investigations of  children ages 0 to 8 known to DCFS who are at risk of death or serious \ninjury within the next 24 months.    There are three teams of reviewers in Chicago, Springfield \nand Belleville.  The investigation will be reviewed at a minimum between the 10th and 15th day, \nthe 45th day and prior to case closure.  Additional reviews can be conducted on the investigation \nat any time. The reviewers focus on nine areas focused on the quality of assessment and \ninformation on child safety:   \no  whether the totality of accessible family history (prior referrals, law enforcement \nand service records, etc.) is sufficiently assessed and utilized in decision making;  \no  whether interviews with all pertinent individuals are timely completed;  \no  whether interviews and observations are sufficient to assess overall family \nfunctioning and include child vulnerability and parent/caregiver capacity to \nprotect;  \no  whether contacts with family are made with sufficient frequency to assess for \nemerging dangers;  \no  whether communications with other parties (collaterals, referred service \nproviders, legal entities) are sufficient to gather information, reconcile conflicting \nstatements and provide relevant information to stakeholders;  \no  whether safety assessments and resulting actions are sufficient to prevent \nmaltreatment;  \no  whether services appropriate to meet the family’s needs are identified and \nprovided;  \no  whether safety-related communications with non-custodial parents are sufficient \nto gather information, reconcile conflicting statements and provide relevant \ninformation; and  \no  whether the supervisory review identifies gaps and provides appropriate and \nsufficient guidance regarding all of the above issues.   \nBased on the review, the reviewer may conduct a staffing with child protection staff to \naddress concerns with the information or assessment process used during the investigation. \nDuring the staffing, action items for child protection staff may be identified and completion dates \nfor those action items are set.  Reviewers are responsible for determining if the action items have \n63 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 64 of 76 PageID #:1572\nbeen completed.  The table below reflects the percent of cases where the reviewers determined \nthat the information obtained during the investigation is satisfactory.   \nFirst Quarter of \nImplementation  Second Quarter of \nPercent \nSAFETY CONSTRUCTS  (Baseline Data for  Implementation \nImprovement\nIllinois)             (8/24/16-11/23/16) \n(5/24/16-8/23/16)  \nQuestion 1 - Utilizing family history in decision-\n67.2%  70.4%  3.2% \nmaking \nQuestion 2 - Timely interviewing  75.6%  77.9%  2.3% \nQuestion 3 - Assessing child vulnerability and \n64.8%  69.4%  4.6% \ncaregiver protective capacities \nQuestion 4 - Frequency of contacts  73.6%  75.1%  1.5% \nQuestion 5 - Stakeholder communication  66.0%  73.0%  7.0% \nQuestion 6 - Sufficiency of safety assessment \n69.2%  78.3%  9.1% \nand planning \nQuestion 7 - Service referral and linkage  62.0%  77.2%  15.2% \nQuestion 8 - Safety-related communication with \n50.9%  52.5%  1.6% \nnon-custodial parents \nQuestion 9 - Sufficiency of supervisory reviews  69.2%  71.3%  2.1% \nOverall  67.1%  72.5%  5.4% \n \n   The Eckerd Prediction is shared weekly with Child Protection Administration and \nRegional Administrators. The goal of the program is to provide reports to management that \nidentify patterns or trends in performance, to provide data to front line staff to improve practice \nand to identify strong administrators, supervisors and investigators whose strategies can be \nmodeled for other staff.   \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \n64 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 65 of 76 PageID #:1573\n  The integration of education data from the Illinois State Board of Education into \nSACWIS is expected to be completed by October 1, 2017.  \n  The mobile development team is working toward a spring release of the updated \nSACWIS app version 2.0 for DCFS investigators and caseworkers both Android and iOS \ndevices. This will facilitate use of the app by private agency partners.   The timeline for roll-out \nto the private agencies is currently under development. The new Significant Event reporting \nsystem to replace the Unusual Incident Report system is expected to be in place by March 31, \n2017. Exhibit HH, Information Technology Projects BH Status Report, p. 6  \n  By the end of February 2017, DCFS staff from Licensing, Recruitment, Information \nTechnology and Communications will meet in person to discuss the marketing and roll-out \nstrategy for the mobile app for foster parent licensing.  DCFS is developing a strategy for a \nstatewide roll-out, including a media and communication strategy to advise the public of the new \non-line process.   \nDCFS is currently developing a mobile application for DCFS licensing staff to capture \ndata, document findings and generate compliance notices.  DCFS licensing staff will be provided \nwith tablets containing appropriate licensing forms that can be completed on site and \nimmediately provided to the licensee.  The roll-out is currently scheduled for mid-2017. The \nmobile application for DCFS licensing staff is currently scheduled to be completed by May 31, \n2017.     \nDCFS anticipates completion of the RFP for system intended to replace SACWIS by \nMay  2017.  The RFP must be approved by ACF and be processed through the state procurement \nprocess by May 2017. \n65 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 66 of 76 PageID #:1574\nProject Goals/Target:  Eckerd/Mindshare will build in reporting mechanisms into the \nEckerd Portal to allow Illinois to provide data to share with Department Administration, \nRegions, and Teams for the nine practice areas being reviewed by the last quarter of \nFY17.  DCFS is currently determining whether to renew or expand the contract for the Rapid \nSafety feedback program.  One issue to be determined is whether to expand the model to intact \nfamily cases. This could be accomplished with current Eckerd staff within the Department. If \napproved, the goal would be to expand to include intact families starting in FY18.  \nPanel Recommendation #5:  Restore funding for the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent \nWell-Being (ISCAW) that uses standardized instruments and assessment scales. (Implementation \nPlan, p. 53). \n \n  1.  Project Goals / Target:  The Implementation Plan contemplated restoration of \nfunding for the ISCAW well-being study, which would be a point-in-time study of the well-\nbeing of the population of children in open placement cases as of a selected date during FY2017.  \nNo similar study has been conducted in Illinois in nine years.  By August, 2016, a Steering \nCommittee comprised of three DCFS representatives and 11 University Partners & POS \nproviders already had been formed.  The well-being study was to replicate most of the methods \nof the Illinois Child Well-Being Year 3 launched in 2004, with additional new features \nincluding:  updated methods to enhance caseworker participation and increase caseworker \nresponse rates, and a brief measure of child life satisfaction to enhance measurement of positive \nchild well-being. Implementation Plan, p. 53.  The report is projected for the second quarter of \n2018.  \n  2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Needs Improvement.   \n  3.          Status Report:  DCFS is working with the Children and Family Research Center \nto plan for reinstituting the Illinois Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being.  It appeared that \n66 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 67 of 76 PageID #:1575\nthe Steering Committee for the Illinois Child Well-Being Study 2017 had reached consensus on \nall major elements of the methodology for the study by August 2016, but issues later arose.    \nThe committee had considered incorporating data from other Illinois data sets such as health data \nin SACWIS and education data from the Illinois State Board of Education.   However, all agreed \nthat at present it is not practical to access and analyze these data in a timely way, expect for the \nCANS data. \n  In November 21, 2016, the Survey Research Laboratory (SRL) of the University of \nIllinois at Chicago (UIC) submitted a proposal to the Children and Family Research Center \n(CFRC) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) for field operations and data \npreparation for the study. UIUC is the contractor for the study and UIC will be a subcontractor.  \nThe SRL proposal details proposed data collection operations, deliverable data sets, a timeline \nand a subcontract budget.  Exhibit MM, Illinois Child Well-Being Study, Presentation to \nDCFS/BH Panel, January 6, 2017.  A sample of 500 to 600 children will be drawn from the \npopulation in care on June 30, 2017.  All children will be in non-permanent substitute care \nplacements for a minimum of three months.  The Survey Research Laboratory at the UIC will \ncalculate and apply sample weights to adjust for design effects and non-response.  Id.  \nDCFS anticipated that the study would begin in the 3rd quarter of 2017.   The start date \nwill be delayed due to the time that was needed to develop the research strategies for the study.  \nUIUC has begun to negotiate data-sharing with Northwestern to incorporate data from Child and \nAdolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) scale that DCFS routinely collects on all children \nentering care. This data on well-being will provide a baseline to relate to data at time of study \ndata collection. \n67 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 68 of 76 PageID #:1576\n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals: By the next reporting period, the Department and its \nuniversity partners will have worked together to establish a date to commence the survey, \nfinalize the research strategies for the study, and establish a target date for completion of the \nstudy.  \n   Panel Recommendation #6: Develop and implement a new plan for monitoring \nresidential and group home programs, utilizing external partners. (Implementation Plan at p. 53).    \n1.  Project Goals / Target:  The goals set out in the Implementation Plan were for \nthe Department, with the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University, to \ndevelop a redesigned residential monitoring program, the goal of which is to increase the safety \nof youth placed at residential treatment facilities and to enhance the effectiveness of the \nresidential services provided at the residential treatment facilities.  As described in the \nImplementation Plan, the program called for development of regional multi-disciplinary \nmonitoring teams that would assess residential programs’ effectiveness utilizing multiple data \nsources and inputs.  Residential monitoring teams were to have been identified and training was \nto have begun by December 2016.  Implementation Plan, Exhibit YY [Dkt. 531-51].  \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Needs Improvement.   \n \n  3.          Status Report:  Despite significant efforts made toward the development and \nimplementation of the monitoring plan, an evaluation of the plan during the design discussions \nled all participants on the Residential Monitoring Redesign Group, including the Expert Panel, \nDCFS, Northwestern University and University of Illinois at Chicago, to conclude that a \nsubstantial redesign of the plan was required in order to effectively monitor the safety and \nquality of care provided to youth in residential treatment facilities.  That conclusion was based \non agreement that the primary focus of the initiative should be to monitor youth and their \nprogress from a clinical perspective, in addition to the regulatory requirement to monitor \n68 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 69 of 76 PageID #:1577\nprograms and facilities from a compliance perspective.  The prior monitoring program the \nDepartment had used focused heavily on facilities’ compliance (or lack thereof) with safety and \nfacility standards, and had not focused on youth outcomes.   \nA comprehensive, revised plan for monitoring now has been developed.  That plan \naddresses the safety, well-being and clinical outcomes of youth in residential facilities in \naddition to a review of the facilities themselves. The new monitoring program, Therapeutic \nResidential Performance Management Initiative (TRPMI), calls for a team approach and \ncollaborative decision making. The primary focus will be on the clinical progress of youth that \nare deemed clinically ready for discharge and/or in Phase II of their treatment. Each TRPMI \nteam is made up of five functions:  Team Coordinator, Monitor, Clinical Specialist, Quality \nImprovement Specialist and Manager. See Exhibit NN, DCFS Residential Monitoring Redesign \n4-Month Status Report, dated 1/17/2017. \nThe TRPMI pilot consists of three teams (1 each in the Northern, Southern and Cook \nDCFS regions).  Implementation of the TRPMI pilot began on January 9, 2017 in the Northern \nand Southern regions.  The Team members are a mix of DCFS staff and university partners’ \nstaff.  Each team consists of 1 Team Coordinator, 2 Monitors, 2 Clinical Specialists and 1 \nQuality Improvement Specialist. The 3 teams will be led by one TRPMI Pilot Manager (from \nUIC) and their progress will be monitored by the TRPMI Steering Committee and evaluated by \nChapin Hall. Collaboration with leadership of the Immersion Sites, QSR, Family Finding and \nTraining is mandatory.  See Exhibit OO, DCFS TRPMI Logic Model – Last Updated 1/12/17. \n  4.          Revised Targets / Goals: Cook County is the remaining region to participate in \nthe pilot.  The TRPMI pilot will become operational in Cook by March 31, 2017. After the pilots \nhave been completed, Chapin Hall will provide data regarding the effectiveness of the pilots.  \n69 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 70 of 76 PageID #:1578\nUpon successful completion of the pilots, the TRPMI strategies will be used to build the internal \ncapacity of DCFS staff to effectively monitor the safety, well-being and permanency of youth \nreceiving residential treatment. The TRPMI monitoring model will then be implemented \nstatewide. The evaluation of the three pilot regions consists of three phases: baseline year \n(CY16), implementation year (CY17), and post-implementation year (CY18). Chapin Hall \ncollected baseline survey data (CY16) on all residential treatment providers, including those in \nthe three pilot regions. During the implementation year (CY17), TRPMI will be implemented in \nthese three pilot regions, in which process and implementation data will be collected to guide \nimplementation. During the post-implementation year (CY18), a follow-up survey will be \nconducted. In addition, outcomes data leveraged from administrative data will be analyzed to \ncompare outcome changes from the baseline year to the post-implementation year (CY16-CY18) \nbetween providers in the pilot regions vs. providers not in the pilot regions. It is anticipated that \nthe monitoring program will identify youth who are ready for step-down but do not have an \nappropriate placement.   \n  Using the Child and Family Team process, the TRPMI teams will collaborate with \nrelevant stakeholders, including case management, residential and immersion site staff, to \ndevelop effective and timely resolutions to the identified barriers.   Concurrently, the TRPMI \nteam will draft Procedures that clarify the roles, responsibilities and communication strategies \nfor assuring completion of tasks identified by the team.    The draft Procedures will be completed \nby February 21, 2017. \n    \nV.  Communication Plan:  Implement a defined Communication Plan with the B.H. Expert \nPanel and Plaintiffs’ attorneys.  (Implementation Plan, p. 55).    \n \n70 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 71 of 76 PageID #:1579\n  1.  Progress Goals / Target:  A Communication Plan, entered by the Court on \nSeptember 28, 2016 [Dkt. 530], provides for bi-weekly conferences with the Expert Panel and \nthe Parties, during which the pilots and programs identified in the Implementation Plan are \ndiscussed.  The plan provides for DCFS to provide a monthly report to the Expert Panel and \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel which details the specific steps that have been taken in actual implementation \nof each initiative set forth in the Implementation Plan, the actual results achieved, any barriers \nthat exist and strategies to eliminate or resolve the barriers, and an evaluation of program results.  \nThe Plan also provides for DCFS to make efforts proactively to share information “beyond that \nwhich directly relates to the specific initiatives described in the Implementation Plan” that \nnevertheless is significant.   \n2.         Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory.    \n \n3.          Status Report:  The Department generally is meeting compliance requirements.  \nBi-weekly Expert Calls occur with DCFS, the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ counsel. Project \nManager calls, to which the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ counsel are invited, occur weekly. B.H. \nSteering Committee calls, to which the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ counsel are invited, occur \nweekly. Agendas for both the Project Managers and Steering Committee Calls are distributed to \nparticipants prior to each meeting. Monthly reports are being provided to the Expert Panel and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel using the templates developed by the Expert Panel, which is based on the \nDesign, Test, Spread, and Sustain (DTSS) Framework commissioned by the U.S. Children's \nBureau. \nImproved communication has resulted in improved collaboration, with the Expert Panel \nparticipating in meetings with stakeholders statewide.  This collaboration has facilitated DCFS’ \nadjustment of some pilots and programs on an ongoing basis.   There have been glitches, \n71 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 72 of 76 PageID #:1580\nhowever.  In several instances, communications or information was provided to the Expert Panel, \nbut not to Plaintiffs’ counsel. In those instances, the Expert Panel has shared the relevant \ninformation with Plaintiffs’ counsel.  And the Expert Panel has identified some instances where \nthe Department was not sufficiently proactive in sharing information, most specifically in \nconnection with issues that have arisen during the development of the QSR process.   \n4.          Revised Targets / Goals:  The Department will continue in its efforts to comply \nwith all requirements of the Communication Plan.  In addition, the parties and the Expert Panel \nwill meet by March 31, 2017 to reach a more refined agreement as to the information that \npresumptively should be provided both to the Expert Panel and to Plaintiffs’ counsel.   \nVI.  Project for a Target Group of Children and Youth/Enhanced IPS Program Beyond \nMedical Necessity Pilot    \n   \n1.  Progress Goals / Target \n \n  In the September 28, 2016 Implementation Plan, DCFS committed to a pilot targeted to \nserve fifty (50) children and youth from Cook County who are in psychiatric hospitals beyond \nmedical necessity (BMN). Fifty (50) youth were to be served, and 100 youth were to be used for \ntwo comparison groups of 50 youths each.  \n   As of September, 2016, when the Court entered the Implementation Plan, the logic model \nfor this pilot had not been refined.  \n   The BMN pilot was scheduled to begin in September 2016 with a review of five cases \nand scheduled to be operational in November 2016.   Amended and Revised Implementation \nPlan, pp. 56-57. \n2.          Expert Panel’s Evaluation Grade:  Satisfactory   \n \n72 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 73 of 76 PageID #:1581\n  3.          Status Report:  During calendar year 2015, a total of 1,826 youth were \nhospitalized; 22.4 % of those youth were hospitalized more than once. A total of 244 youth were \nidentified as having remained in hospitals beyond medical necessity in 2015.11  \nDuring 2016, 1841 youth were hospitalized and 419 (22.8 %) of these youth have been \nhospitalized more than once.  A total of 265 youth were identified as having remained in \nhospitals beyond medical necessity.12  \nPrior to instituting this BMN project, the Department had increased its focus on the BMN \npopulation.  In October 2016 the Department instituted twice weekly staffings with involved \nparties, including caseworker/supervisor, Central Matching, PHP, and DCFS Clinical.  These \nmeetings focused on ensuring that all parties are actively working on solutions and arranging \ncase coordination and step-down services to further reduce the amount of youth that are BMN.  \nSince the BMN project start, as of February 10, 2017, 11 youth were considered BMN as \ncompared to 18 youth that were BMN December 8, 2016, and significantly fewer than the \nnumber of BMN youth in December 2015.  As the pilot originally was envisioned, it was \nassumed that youth in the BMN pilot would already have developed a strong relationship with a \ncaseworker and that it would be important to preserve those strong relationships.    It soon \nbecame obvious however, that many of the youth who have been categorized as BMN were new \nto foster care and did not have an established relationship with a caseworker. For example, of the \n18 youth who were BMN as of December 8, 2016, nine of the youth were new to DCFS custody, \nwith custody being taken either after hospitalization or less than three months prior to \nhospitalization.  \n                                                            \n11 DCFS Psychiatric Hospital Database \n12 Id. \n73 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 74 of 76 PageID #:1582\nAccordingly, the pilot has been revised as follows: 1) the pilot will serve 50 youth who \nreside in Cook County and collar counties, who are psychiatrically hospitalized BMN, and who \nhave an assigned caseworker; 2) the selected youth must have been recommended for a home \nsetting; 3) the selected youth’s caseworker must work for a case management agency that is \nwilling to receive coaching and support by a Kaleidoscope Stabilization Consultant13; and 4) the \nassigned case management agency must commit to continuing the case management role for the \nyouth even if the service or placement setting of the youth changes.  Exhibit PP, Enhanced IPS \nProgram Beyond Medical Necessity Pilot, January 3, 2017, p. 1.  The pilot contemplates that \nfive days before a youth’s clinical staffing at the psychiatric hospital, DCFS will be notified of \nthe upcoming staffing and will participate if there is a risk that a youth could become beyond \nmedical necessity or there is a risk that no appropriate placement is available.  Once a youth is \nidentified as appropriate for the pilot, a Stabilization Consultant will be assigned to the case \nmanagement team.  The Stabilization Consultant will model, teach, guide and assist the case \nmanagement team and work to improve the case management team’s assessment, engagement \nand individualized planning.  Id.   \n  The Child and Family Team (CFT) will serve as the hub of the decision making, service \nplanning and assessment process.  The CFT will meet monthly and review the plan for the youth, \nand review whether the youth is achieving placement stability, and emotional and educational \nstability.  The CFT will make adjustments and modifications as necessary to the youth’s services \nand supports.   Id.  \n  Each Stabilization Consultant will be assigned five to ten cases. The small number of \nassigned cases is designed to allow the development of a stronger relationship with the case \n                                                            \n13 Kaleidoscope is the selected provider for this project.   \n74 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 75 of 76 PageID #:1583\nmanagement team and increased contact with clinical, community and other service providers.  \nId.    The Stabilization Consultant will ensure that the casework relationship with the youth and \nthe family considers strengths-based approaches to best engage the youth and family since \nengagement is the foundation upon which trust must be built.  Id.    \n  The youth and the family will have access to Intensive Placement Stabilization services \nprovided by Kaleidoscope, regardless of catchment area in Chicago.  The service array can \ninclude immediate crisis response.  Flexible funds will be available for the purchase of services \noutside of the case management agency’s current programming as necessary to meet the needs of \nthe youth and family.  Id.       \nMost youth who are identified as BMN move to a congregate care setting. Therefore, the \ntheory of change for this pilot is that the provision of intensive and clinically knowledgeable \nconsultation and coaching by stabilization consultants will enable caseworkers to resolve \nproblems that otherwise would impede the youth from maintaining placement stability in a \nfamily-like setting.  Exhibit OO, DCFS TRPMI Logic Model – Last Updated 1/12/17. \nThe pilot will be evaluated against a comparison group.  The comparison group will be \nidentified to show the impact of the services delivered for youth included as part of the BMN \nPilot compared to BMN and other youth who were psychiatrically hospitalized and received \npost-discharge services as usual.  DCFS will work with Chapin Hall to define the comparison \ngroup and will identify the comparison group by March 30, 2017. This comparison group will \nreceive services as usual and may include youth that are already in specialized, adolescent or \ntherapeutic foster home programs.  Exhibit PP, Enhanced IPS Program Beyond Medical \nNecessity Pilot, January 3, 2017.    \n75 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 538 Filed: 03/03/17 Page 76 of 76 PageID #:1584\nSince implementation of the amended pilot began in January 2017, three children have \nbeen identified to receive services through the pilot.  Services that are being provided for these \nyouth by Kaleidoscope since the implementation include: supportive care coordination provided \nby the stabilization consultant, mentoring and facilitation of Child and Family Team Meetings, \nIPS servicing and transportation to services and flexible funding when needed.    \n     4.          Revised Targets / Goals:   \nDCFS will amend the current contract with Kaleidoscope for Intensive Stabilization \nServices in light of the substantial changes that have been made to this initiative.  Kaleidoscope \nmust hire staff for this pilot and expects to post new positions for the Stabilization Consultants in \nJanuary 2017.   Exhibit PP, Enhanced IPS Program Beyond Medical Necessity Pilot, January 3, \n2017, p. 5.  The target date for hiring and necessary training to occur for the first stabilization \nconsultant is March 31, 2017.  Until then, no more than three youth will be served through the \npilot.  By April 30, 2017 it is expected that at least five new youth will be assigned to the pilot.  \nKaleidoscope will add a Stabilization Consultant for every five – eight BMN youth added to the \nBMN pilot.  An end date for this pilot has not yet been determined and will be better defined \nbased on the outcomes for sustaining community based services for these youth.    \n \n76 \n ",

Alonso \nUnited States District Court, Northern District \n219 South Dearborn, Courtroom 1219 \nChicago, Illinois 60604 \n \n \nRe: B.H. v. Sheldon, No.: 1:88-cv-05599 \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \n \nJudge Alonso: \n \n  DCFS, with Plaintiffs and the Expert Panel, have submitted the Second Triannual Report \nto the Court regarding the projects and initiatives identified in the Implementation Plan. It covers \nthe time period generally from February through March of 2017.  After providing written input \nand discussing the report’s contents with the parties, we decided to submit separate comments to \nthe Court outlining some of our particular concerns and planned areas of focus in the upcoming \nmonths. We have discussed our concerns and plans with the parties.  \n  As noted in the Second Triannual Report, we continue to see progress in the execution of \nseveral initiatives under the Implementation Plan. We are concerned, however, that the ongoing \nstate budget problems, the pending expiration of key contractual agreements, and especially the \npotential loss of key leadership staff with the resignation of George Sheldon might derail the \npositive change we’ve seen thus far. We are grateful for the close collaborative relationship we’ve \nbeen able to forge with key DCFS staff, but remain frustrated with learning about pertinent \ninitiatives and issues too late or only after major decisions have been made.   \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:2385  \n \n \n \n  The parties and Expert Panel continue to have regular bi-weekly phone conferences and \nfrequent additional face-to-face and phone conferences to address specific issues and concerns.  \nDCFS project managers, the Expert Panel, and the parties also have regular weekly teleconference \ncalls regarding the status of BH projects.  Monthly reports for each project are provided to the \nExpert Panel and parties.  These regular phone conferences and other face-to-face meetings assist \nin the identification of projects that are proceeding according to the Implementation Plan and \ninstances where progress has been impeded or initiatives have gone off course in the estimation of \neither the Expert Panel or Plaintiffs’ counsel. The Experts have conducted bi-weekly tutorials with \nproject managers to help them prepare monthly and 4-month status reports. In some cases, the \nExperts have conducted special data analyses to improve project managers’ understanding of the \nproblems and enhance their ability to monitor progress.  We expect our productive working \nrelationship to continue as DCFS grapples with the impact of the upcoming leadership change and \nwith the implementation challenges associated with putting in place and sustaining the services \nclass members need. \nDespite progress toward the Department’s reform goals since February, 2017, we, as well \nas the Plaintiffs, have voiced our concerns about significant barriers to effective implementation, \nespecially as DCFS moves into the next phase of work required under the Implementation Plan. \nWe  agree  with  the  concerns  set  out  in  Plaintiffs’  Additional  Report  to  the  Court  (filed \ncontemporaneously with the Second Triannual Report) and share their view that the Department \ncontinues to undertake significant initiatives without ensuring that those initiatives fit with the \nrevised core practice model that the Department has adopted.  This problem already has led to \nconfusion and delay and threatens to derail the Department’s efforts if left uncorrected. \n \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  2 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:2386  \n \n \n \nExpert Panel to Increase Monitoring Activities \nThe Expert Panel is concerned that, even without the upcoming DCFS leadership change, \nthe next phase of implementation of some of the initiatives is imperiled due to their complexity \nand interdepartmental scope.  The Expert Panel believes there is a need for deliberate focus on the \nconnection and integration among the BH initiatives and all other DCFS and interdepartmental \nfunctions and practices.   \nIn the Expert Panel’s view, some longstanding DCFS functions and practices are not \nconsistent with, and at times run counter to, the tenets of the newly developed DCFS Core Practice \nModel.  This lack of congruence and integration among all departmental functions and practices \ncontinues to have an impact on the pace of implementation and on the extent to which actual \nimplementation is consistent with the Core Practice Model as well as with the plans and designs \nfor the various initiatives.  The Expert Panel sees evidence that these challenges are likely to \ncontinue absent deliberate focus on resolving them or at least mitigating their impact.  Therefore, \nat  this  critical  juncture,  the  Expert  Panel  will  increase  its  level  of  participation  and  direct \nmonitoring of DCFS’ implementation efforts to ensure that the BH initiatives proceed without \nunwarranted administrative or structural obstacles, are consistent with the Core Practice Model, \nand are effective in meeting the needs of class members. \nThe functions and responsibilities of the Expert Panel include providing assistance to the \nparties and the Court in evaluating the Implementation Plan, and evaluating DCFS’ progress in \nmaking the reforms necessary for effective implementation of its initiatives.  Going forward, when \nit deems necessary, the Expert Panel will make formal recommendations to the parties and the \nCourt about actions it believes DCFS needs to take to achieve the outcomes set forth in the \nImplementation Plan.  We have developed a productive relationship with the parties, and expect \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  3 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:2387  \n \n \n \nthat to continue, even as we step up our monitoring activities.  We believe any disagreements about \nour recommendations can be resolved collaboratively among the parties, but, if not, the parties will \nnot hesitate to request the Court to resolve any such disagreements.  \nAs the Expert Panel increases its monitoring activities, such activities will result in more \nindependent analysis and assessment of DCFS implementation efforts (which, of course, we will \nshare with the parties).  As a consequence, the Expert Panel will provide supplemental and separate \nreports to the Court in the future containing any independent findings and recommendations, as \nwe deem necessary. \nFinally, in order to fulfill our responsibilities at this nascent stage of implementation, we \nneed additional consultation and staff support.  Following submission and approval by the Court \nof the Second Triannual Status Report, we will work with the parties to agree on how our \nconsultation and staff support needs will be met. \nSignificant and Complex Implementation Challenges \nThe Expert Panel has voiced concerns about several significant implementation challenges \nthat are likely to have an impact on DCFS’ ability to proceed as planned with its initiatives.  Some \nof these challenges were unanticipated, but for most, DCFS saw them coming or should have \nanticipated them and taken steps to inform and address them with the Expert Panel and the \nPlaintiffs well in advance of the moment when they became serious enough to jeopardize the \nimplementation and delivery of services to class members.  We provide here some examples of \nthese challenges. \nInformation Systems and Management - One example of an overarching challenge has \nbeen DCFS’ lack of ready capacity to modify and/or develop technology and information systems \nthat fulfill essential management, reporting, and monitoring functions for internal and external \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  4 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:2388  \n \n \n \nstakeholders.  As set forth in the Implementation Plan, “while internal positions are being \nestablished and filled,” DCFS has contracted with outside vendors, such as Mindshare.  The \ncontract with Mindshare began in September 2015 and is in place through January 2018.  DCFS \nhas disclosed that it may not be in a position to continue, after its current contracts expire (one as \nearly as the end of June, 2017 and the other in January 2018), the development and maintenance \nof “dashboards” and other information technology and data analysis functions that all parties agree \nare essential for managing and monitoring BH initiatives and outcomes. Then, as recently as June \n6, 2017, DCFS informed Plaintiffs and us for the first time that it is in the process of developing a \nreplacement for the Mindshare platform using POWERBI and MS SQL server engines in-house.  \nNeither we nor the Plaintiffs have had a chance to evaluate how this planned shift from \nMindshare will impact the Department’s operations or implementation efforts. In light of this most \nrecent information, we plan to obtain independent IT consultation to advise us how best to move \nforward  with  BH  implementation  monitoring  if  the  Department  proceeds  with  securing  or \ndeveloping an alternative to Mindshare. Our concern, which we believe the parties share, is that \nregardless of a specific product or platform, the Department must be able to perform certain \nessential information management functions to include, among others: \n(i)  Development of a platform that allows the Department to draw essential data from \nmultiple data sources (e.g., SACWIS, CYCIS, CANS, Medicaid, and project-specific databases) \nin which information regarding children in care is stored;  \n(ii)  Development of “dashboards” that allow one to pull select, pre-identified data points \nneeded to monitor the metrics for child well-being, permanency and safety, and to evaluate the \nefficacy of the various program initiatives DCFS has undertaken as part of the Implementation \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  5 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:2389  \n \n \n \nPlan.  Significant progress has been made in developing the Mindshare platform, developing and \nvalidating the various “dashboards” DCFS needs, but that essential work is by no means complete. \nOther essential information management functions that could be in jeopardy include:  \n(i)  Mobile  applications  for  timely  input  of  investigation,  background  checking,  and \nlicensing data;  \n(ii)  Help with the development of and requirements for measuring child well-being as part \nof the overarching outcome measures;  \n(iii)    Assistance  with  the  development  of  a  means  to  automate  the  extraction  and \nreformatting of computerized education records for youth in care from the Illinois State Board of \nEducation, so that those records can be added to SACWIS; \n(iv)  Development of security protocols that must be in place before private providers \ncaring for DCFS youth will be able to access the Mindshare platform – a development essential to \nimplementation of the Department’s new Core Practice Model; and  \n(v) The Department’s ability to begin the feasibility study for the anticipated CCWIS \nconversion from SACWIS by July 2017 may be imperiled, which poses the threat that the \nDepartment could lose $1,400,000 in federal funds that would pay for that study. If this occurs, \nthe process of converting to an upgraded CCWIS system may well be delayed by as much as 18 \nmonths to two years. \nDepartment of Health and Family Services Managed Care RFP - Another example of \na significant implementation challenge is the Illinois Department of Health and Family Services’ \n(“HFS”) issuance of a request for proposals for a mandatory managed care program that would \nprovide medical care, mental health care, and other “covered services” for all children in DCFS’ \ncare (the BH class members).  DCFS was involved in the development of the RFP, but did not \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  6 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:2390  \n \n \n \ninform the Expert Panel or the Plaintiffs of the RFP’s key elements or seek our input regarding the \npotential  impact  on  services  and  service  management  for  BH  class  members  prior  to  the \nfinalization of the RFP.   \nThe RFP and model MCO contract contemplate the use of “care coordinators,” who are \nemployed by the MCO, and who have critical responsibilities in identifying and coordinating \nservice delivery to youth in care.  However, the assignment of lead service planning responsibility \nto MCO “care coordinators,” as described and interpreted in the RFP by the Expert Panel, directly \nconflicts with the assignment of responsibilities to “permanency workers” under the Core Practice \nModel DCFS has adopted and is beginning to implement in the Immersion Sites.  DCFS has \ninsisted  that  permanency  workers,  not  MCO  Care  Coordinators,  will  have  the  primary \nresponsibility for ensuring that appropriate plans are developed and implemented through Child \nand Family Teams. Further, if a problem emerges about the role and authority of MCO Care \nCoordinators, it can be addressed in the “negotiation phase” of the MCO contract once an MCO \nentity has been selected, and that HFS is not under any obligation to execute a contract with an \nMCO entity if it does not meet DCFS’ requirements.  The Department has stated that control over \ndeciding what services a youth in care needs will not be ceded to the MCO.  But at the same time, \nthe Department has stated that it cannot confirm that it has the power to ensure that the final \ncontract (if any) that HFS may choose to adopt for youth in care will fit with DCFS’ practice \nmodel.  Until a bidder is selected (by June 30, 2017), DCFS has said they are prohibited from \nanswering the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs’ questions about the rationale or content of the RFP due \nto procurement restrictions.  While the Expert Panel understands that the RFP bidding and \nselection process is tightly controlled to ensure fairness, it is quite concerned that the questions it \nraised  for  several  months  were  not  addressed,  and  perhaps  not  anticipated,  as  part  of  the \nB.H. Expert Panel Supplemental Comments on the  7 \nSecond Triannual Joint Interim Status Report \nJune 9, 2017 \n\n \nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 544 Filed: 06/09/17 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:2391  \n \n \n \ndevelopment of the RFP prior to its issuance.  Of even greater concern to the Expert Panel is that \nDCFS did not inform or engage the Expert Panel or Plaintiffs, well before the RFP was finalized, \nin discussions and consideration about the potential impact that a restructured behavioral health \nsystem could have on youth in DCFS custody. \n  Community-Based  Service  Contracts  and  Determination  of  Residential  Service \nCapacity Needs -  The Expert Panel continues to observe a pervasive departmental problem \nexecuting timely contracts with existing and new providers that secure, maintain, and individualize \nthe whole range of needed services for families and children with challenging emotional and \nbehavioral needs.  One example involves the service contracts for the agencies participating in the \nTFC pilot. Service contracts are in place through Fiscal Year 2017 and are in process of being \ndistributed and executed for Fiscal Year 2018. The Expert Panel is concerned about the current \nlengthy contract negotiation and rate setting process underway for this particular service have \ndelayed finalizing contracts and reimbursing agencies for their contract expenses.  \n  DCFS’ long-standing need for appropriate residential services is well-documented. The \nPlaintiffs’ separate filing describes both ongoing and recently identified problems with the array \nof residential services required to address specialized needs of youth, as well as problems with the \noverall capacity of needed residential services for DCFS youth. The Expert Panel agrees with the \nconcerns described in the Plaintiffs’ separate filing.  \nThe Expert Panel is in the process of requesting information from DCFS about a variety of \nareas related to residential services, including its current and anticipated residential capacity for \nFY2018 (e.g., residential facilities, specialized foster care) and contract amounts and expenditures. \nIn the immediate short-term, we will work closely with DCFS and the Plaintiffs to assess and make \nB.H.

The parties having represented that the findings set forth in the Report of the \nExpert Panel dated July 21, 2015 (Dkt. No. 490-1, the “Expert Report”) are undisputed, the \nCourt hereby adopts those findings in full.  \n2.  The  Court  approves  Expert  Report  Recommendation  1,  regarding  the \ndevelopment of a system of care demonstration program that permits DCFS and Purchase of \nService to waive various restrictions on a trial basis to placements in residential treatment \nfacilities.    The  Court  sustains  the  Department’s  objection  only  to  the  extent  that  this \nrecommendation requires action by other state agencies and third parties not parties to this \nlawsuit.  The Department has agreed to work in cooperation with these other entities and to \ncoordinate  activities  with  these  other  entities  as  appropriate,  and  if  the  goals  expressed  in \nRecommendation 1 cannot be achieved by that cooperation, the Department will inform the \nparties and the Court and prepare an alternative plan in respect to Recommendation 1.   \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 507 Filed: 10/20/15 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:860\n3.     The Court approves Expert Report Recommendation 2.  \n4.  The Court approves Recommendation 3.  \n5.     The  Court  approves  Recommendation  4.    The  Court  acknowledges  that  the \nDepartment has already hired and been working with outside experts and has already submitted a \nrevised organizational structure to the Illinois Department of Central Management Services and \nthis order is not intended to require the retention of additional consultants.  If the steps that the \nDepartment  already  has  taken  are  insufficient  to  accomplish  the  goals  set  forth  in \nRecommendation  4,  the  Department  shall  address  the  additional  actions  it  will  take  to \naccomplish those goals in the Department’s Implementation Plan.  \n6.     The Court approves Recommendation 5.  \n7.     The Court, having been advised that the parties have reached an agreement to a \nrevised Recommendation 6, approves revised Recommendation 6 as set forth below: \n   a.  The  Court  shall  appoint  an  external  panel  of  experts  (Expert  Panel) \npursuant to Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence under the same terms in \nrespect  to  payment  for  their  services  set  forth  in  the  Court’s  Order  of \nAppointment dated April 10, 2015.   \nb.  The Panel members shall assist the Department in development of its \nimplementation plan for reform, as set forth at sub-paragraphs h-i below.  It is \nhoped that the Department’s implementation plan can be submitted with common \nagreement of the parties and the Expert Panel.  The Implementation Plan shall \naddress  the  necessary  reforms  to  be  undertaken  in  a  manner  consistent  with \naccepted social work practice and standards and the Recommendations set forth in \nthe prior Report dated July 21, 2015 (see Dkt. 790-1, hereinafter the “Report”).    \n  c.  The Expert Panel also shall assist the parties and the Court in evaluating \nthe  Department’s  implementation  plan,  the  Department’s  progress  in  making \nreforms, and the effectiveness of the reform efforts.  The BH parties propose that \nthree of the current court-appointed experts, Marci White, Paul Vincent and Mark \nTesta, serve on this Expert Panel.    \nd.  The parties and Expert Panel hope and expect that this process will be \ncollaborative, will address issues on an on-going basis, and will lead to agreement \nwhenever possible. If at any time the experts deem it necessary, they may report \ndirectly to the Court. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 507 Filed: 10/20/15 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:861\ne.  The Expert Panel will be provided full access to the information needed to \nperform their responsibilities.  The Expert panel will have reasonable access to all \nnon-privileged documents, data, records and information in the possession of \nDCFS  or  any  person  or  agency  contracting  with  DCFS  to  provide  care  and \nservices to children.  The Expert Panel shall be permitted to interview privately, at \nreasonable times and places,  any person  with relevant information, including \nchildren, parents, foster parents, DCFS employees and other persons providing \nservices to class members.  The consent of persons other than DCFS employees or \nofficials shall be required before such interviews take place.  The Expert Panel \nmay  also  conduct  on-site  inspections  of  any  facilities  or  programs  providing \nservices to DCFS wards.  \nf.  The Expert Panel may communicate ex parte (without other parties or \ncounsel)  with  any  party  or  counsel  for  any  party.    If  the  Expert  Panel \ncommunicates in writing with the Court, it must simultaneously serve copies on \nthe parties.  The Panel shall not communicate orally with the Court without \naffording the parties prior notice and an opportunity to be present.       \ng.  If  any  member  of  the  Expert  Panel  resigns  or  otherwise  becomes \nunavailable, the parties will attempt to agree on the selection of a replacement to \npropose to the Court.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement, each party will \nnominate one person to serve as the replacement and present the issue to the Court \nfor resolution.     \nh.  In consultation with the Expert Panel, the Department should, within the \nframework of the Report [Dkt. 790-1], develop an enforceable implementation \nplan pursuant to Paragraph 68(d) of the Consent Decree, which identifies the \ntasks, responsibilities and timeframes necessary to accomplish the objectives of \nthe  Consent  Decree  as  addressed  in  the  Expert  Panel’s  findings  and \nrecommendations. The parties and the Expert Panel will confer regularly as the \nDepartment  develops  the  implementation  plan  and  thereafter.  This \nimplementation plan should be developed within four (4) months and submitted to \nthe Court for approval.  At least two weeks prior to the deadline for submission, \nthe Department will provide final drafts of the plan to Plaintiffs and the Expert \nPanel.  The parties and the Expert Panel will attempt to resolve any disagreements \nregarding the implementation plan. If any disputes remain, the parties and the \nExpert Panel will provide the Court with their respective positions as to such \ndisputes.     \ni.  The implementation plan will provide for the Department to contract with \nan external partner to perform an effective residential and group-home monitoring \nprogram.  The Department shall use an external partner for that function until \nsuch time as the Department has sufficient staff with the necessary experience and \nclinical expertise to perform the function internally and further has developed an  \nin-house  program  that  can  monitor  residential  and  group-home  placements \neffectively.   \nj.  The parties recognize that the implementation plan may not anticipate all \nof the obstacles the Department may encounter and that experience may lead to \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 507 Filed: 10/20/15 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:862\nrevisions of the initial plan.  As a result, once initially approved by the Court, the \nimplementation plan should be reviewed by the Department, Plaintiffs’ counsel, \nand the experts regularly.  Necessary revisions will be included in amendments to \nthe plan following the same process as set forth in paragraph 7h, above.  Any such \namendments will be submitted to the Court for approval with the next Status \nReport. \nk.  The  Department  is  in  the  process  of  developing  an  Internal  Change \nManagement, Strategic Planning and Innovation Unit (“the Unit”) which will \nreport directly to the Director. The Unit will be empowered to drive system \nchange and implement actions necessary to achieve compliance with the Consent \nDecree. It is expected that the Department will identify a single individual within \nthe Unit who has responsibility for and sufficient authority to oversee and direct \nthe Department’s plan and implementation efforts to achieve compliance, and to \nserve as the primary contact with the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs.  The individual \nwill update the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs through regular meetings and other \ncommunication during periods of plan development, in the filing of the interim \nStatus Reports, described immediately below, and thereafter.  \nl.  The Department shall prepare interim Status Reports for submission to the \nExpert Panel and Plaintiffs regarding the status of its implementation efforts to \nachieve compliance and the efficacy of those efforts.  The reports should include, \nat a minimum: 1) the steps that the Department has taken for addressing system \nbarriers  and  for  rolling-out  and  assessing  the  fidelity  of  the  Department’s \nimplementation  of  its  proposed  practice  model  and  identified  evidence-based \ninterventions;  2)  the  results  of  its  formative  evaluation  and  any  summative \nevaluations  of  impacts  following  the  guidelines  in  the  Children’s  Bureau’s \n“Framework” publication and using appropriate comparison groups and one or \nmore of the 26 key metrics and other measures; and  3) the various quality service \nreviews undertaken for ensuring that children are being fully served as intended \nand  learning  when  specific  initiatives  should  be  sustained,  discontinued,  or \nrevised when the desired goals are not being achieved.  \nm.  The Department shall provide to the Expert Panel and Plaintiffs interim \nStatus Reports every four months after the Court’s approval of the Department’s \nimplementation plan. Plaintiffs may provide to the Expert Panel a response to the \nreport raising any issues regarding the Department’s implementation efforts and \nany objections to the report’s sufficiency or accuracy. The Expert Panel, in turn, \nmay obtain verification of the accuracy, reliability, and validity of the information \nand findings contained in the Interim Status Reports.  The parties and Expert \nPanel  shall  use  the  interim  Status  Reports,  Plaintiffs’  feedback  and  other \ninformation the Department has to prepare Interim Status Reports for submission \nto the Court regarding the Department’s progress toward compliance, and further \nrecommending corrective courses of action for the Department when appropriate.   \nThe expectation is that the parties and Expert Panel will submit to the Court a \nsingle Status Report with common agreement on the progress of the Department’s \nimplementation  plan,  the  Department’s  progress  in  making  reforms  and  the \neffectiveness of the reform efforts. The parties and the Expert Panel will attempt \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:88-cv-05599 Document #: 507 Filed: 10/20/15 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:863\nto resolve any disagreements regarding the interim Status Reports.  If any disputes \nremain,  the  parties  and  the  Expert  Panel  will  provide  the  Court  with  their \nrespective positions as to such disputes.   \nn.  The Implementation Plan and the Interim Status Reports will describe how \nthe Department will develop, in partnership with one or more of its University \npartners, a results-oriented accountability system that improves regular and timely \naccess  to  available  data,  develops  new  measurement  systems  to  monitor \nimplementation integrity, evaluates intervention effectiveness in accomplishing \nintended  results,  and  adapts  program  modifications  flexibly  when  results  are \ncontrary to expectations.  \no.  The Expert  Panel shall serve at least for the period up to and including the \nissuance  of  the  interim  Status  Report  due  twelve  months  after  the  Court’s \napproval of the implementation plan.  At that time, expected to be January 2017, \nthe parties shall provide the Court with a Joint Status Report, setting out their \nrespective positions regarding the additional time, if any, the Expert Panel should \ncontinue  to  serve,  and  shall  include  in  that  filing  the  Expert  Panel’s \nrecommendation regarding the need, if any, for continued service.  The Expert \nPanel’s appointment shall not end until entry of an Order by the Court terminating \nthe appointment on the grounds that the Department has achieved substantial \ncompliance  with  the  goals  of  the  implementation  plan  and  has  adequately \naddressed the findings in the report of the court-appointed experts [Dkt. 790-1].   \n  8.  In accordance with revised Recommendation 6, set forth in Paragraph 7 above, \nthe Court appoints an external panel of experts (Expert Panel) pursuant to Rule 706 of the \nFederal Rules of Evidence.  The Expert Panel shall consist of Mark Testa, Paul Vincent, and \nMarci White.     \n                \nSO ORDERED: \n \n10/20/15            _______________________     \n              Jorge L.
