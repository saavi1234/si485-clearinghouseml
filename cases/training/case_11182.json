    "summary": "<p>In March 1996 the plaintiff, an inmate of the Milwaukee County Jail,  filed a pro se complaint in state court alleging that he was confined in dangerous conditions in violation of the Wisconsin State Constitution.  Specifically, the Plaintiff claimed that overcrowding in the jail led to needless pain and suffering, and posed a serious danger to the physical and mental well-being of inmates.  The Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee began representing the plaintiff and sought to represent a class of all present and future inmates of the jail.  On October 15, 1996 the county court (Judge Michael Skwierawski) certified the case as a class action.  </p><p>On June 19, 2001 the court (Judge Thomas Donegan) approved a consent decree that was divided into one part dealing with population controls and another dealing with medical care.  It required that the county maintain a population cap in the jail generally and in the booking room specifically.  It provided that no inmate would spend more than thirty hours in the booking room and required better staffing and training for staff in that area.  In terms of medical care it required that the county provide adequate, well-trained staff and complete screening of inmates for physical and mental health conditions.  It further set out requirements for physical examinations, dental care, women's health, sick call, mental health, chronic care, and emergencies.  The parties were to agree to a medical monitor to supervise the medical care provisions while the court retained jurisdiction over the population control provisions until the defendant was in full compliance.  </p><p>In late 2003, plaintiffs' counsel requested an investigation of compliance with the consent decree.  In the thirty month period between November 2001 and April 2004 there had been 16,662 violations of the thirty hour maximum waiting period in the booking room.  Additionally, the conditions remained substandard and unsanitary in contravention of the consent decree.  On September 13, 2004 plaintiffs moved for enforcement of the consent decree.  On January 4, 2006 the county court (Judge Clare L. Fiorenza) found that the Milwaukee County Jail had deliberately violated the consent decree and had been in contempt of court, but that sanctions were unavailable because the violations had ceased.</p><p>Plaintiffs appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals and on January 29, 2008 the court (Judges Wedemeyer, Fine, and Kessler) reversed on the basis of an intervening decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  Milwaukee County appealed to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin and on July 21, 2009 the Supreme Court (Justices Abrahamson, Bradley, Crooks, Gableman, Prosser, Roggensack, and Ziegler) reversed the appeals court by a vote of four to three and held that since the violations of the consent decree had ceased remedial sanctions were unavailable.</p><p></p>",

Henrichs, 2007 WI 102,304 Wis. 2d 1, 736 .\nN.W2d 85, does Chapter 785 ofthe Wisconsin Statutes allow for an award\nof damages as a remedial sanction where the contemptuous conduct has\nceased and traditional avenues of relief are still available to the allegedly\naggrieved party?\nThe Court ofAppeals answered \"Yes.\"\n2. Should the decision in Frisch be applied retroactively to the\nfacts of this case when the conduct at issue ceased and the Circuit Court\nissued its rulingbeforeFrisch was decided?\nThe Court ofAppeals answered.\"Yes.\"\n3. If the Court ofAppeals correctly applied Frisch, should the\nholding ofFrisch be reexamined?\n.The Court of Appeals did not answer this question, as only\nthis Court has the power to reexamine its holding inFrisch.\n4. If the Court of Appeals correctly applied Frisch, did it\nnonetheless improperly usurp the role of the Circuit Court by mandating\nthat it award damages to 16,662 former prisoners ofthe Milwaukee County\nJail, thereby eliminating any discretion on the part of the Circuit Court to\ndetermine theproper remedial sanction?\nThe Court ofApp~alsdid not answer this question, as it arises\nonly because of the manner in which the Court of Appeals\nremanded this case to the Circuit Court.\n\nSTATEMENT ON ORAL ARGUMENT AND PUBLICATION\nPetitioners, Milwaukee County and Milwaukee County Sheriff.\nDavid A. Clarke, Ir. (collectively, \"Milwaukee County\" or \"the County\"),\nrespectfully request the opportunity to present their position at oral\nargument. Oral argument will assist this Court by allowing the parties to\nmore fully present the theories and legal authorities developed in their\nrespective briefs and because ofthe significance ofthe statutory and public\npolicy issues raised by this case.\nThe County respectfully submits thatthe decision in this case should\nbe published. Specifically, the decision in this case islikelyto substantially\nclarifY the law inWisconsin regarding theimposition ofremedial sanctions\nfor contempt and resolve a matter ofsubstantial and continuing interest to\nthe public.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nIn Wisconsin, remedial contempt sanctions are limited to those\nimposed for the purpose of terminating a \"continuing\" contempt of court.\nWis. Stat. §§ 785.01(3) & 785.04(1). Accordingly, in the past, the\nWisconsin courts have consistently held that contemptuous conduct must\nbe ongoing to permit an award of remedial sanctions. See, e.g., State v.\nKing, 82 Wis. 2d 124, 130,262 N.W.2d 80 (1978); Evans v. Luebke, 2003\nWI App 207, ~ 22,267 Wis. 2d 596, 671 N.W.2d 304; Benn v.Benn, 230\nWis. 2d 301,309,602 N.W.2d 65 (Ct. App. 1999).\nMore recently, in Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, 304 Wis. 2d I,\n736 N.W.2d 85, a four justice.majority of this Court moved beyond the\n2\n\nclear words of the statute and theiraditional reading of a trial court's\nre!TIedial .contempt powers in considering what constitutes a continuing\ncontempt. However, the Frisch majority did so in the context ofa family\n.court proceeding where the contempt had deprived the victim of any\ntraditional avenues ofrecourse and where a compelling argument was made\nthat the underlying conduct was, in fact, still continuing.\nIn this case, the decision of the Court of Appeals represents a\nwholesale departure from any traditional understanding of a trial court's\nremedial contempt powers under Chapter 785 and imposes an incorrect rule.\nregarding continuing contempt. Indeed, it is undisputed that the conduct\nunderlying the Circuit Court's finding ofcontempt - the holding oflawfully\nincarcerated prisoners in the booking room ofthe Milwaukee County Jail in\nexcess ofthirty hours before assigning them to a housing area elsewhere in\nthe Jail in violation of a 2001 consent decree - ceased months before\nplaintiffs' initial contempt motion was filed. Further, the conduct at issue\ndid not deprive plaintiffs of a traditional remedy for any harm they\nallegedly suffered. Nonetheless, according to the Court of Appeals, the\ncontempt was continuing under Frisch simply because any harm suffered\nby individual members ofthe plaintiff class was \"unremedied.\" Based on\nthis holding, the Court of Appeals remanded to the Circuit Court with\ndirections that it conduct further proceedings to determine the amount of\nthe monetary sanction to be imposed against the County in favor of the\nplaintiffprisoners.\n3\n\nIf the Court of Appeals' decision is allowed to stand, any act of\ncontempt will now necessarily be continuing and subject to remedial\nsanctions - even if the underlying conduct itself has stopped - unless and\nuntil the persons allegedly harmed by the conduct have been compensated.\nSuch a result is in direct conflict with the statutory language, is inconsistent.\nwith prior decisions of this Court regarding remedial contempt sanctions,\nand was not intended by the majority's holding inFrisch.\nMoreover, the Court ofAppeals' decision usurps the Circuit Court's\ndiscretion by mandating that it award damages as a remedial sanction rather\nthan directing it to consider damages as one possible sanction under the\nstatute. In doing sO,the decision takes a judicial decree that arose from a\ncase filed more than twelve years ago seeking only injunctive relief - a\ndecree that purposefully did not contemplate compensatory damages for a\nviolation ofits provisions- andgives it new lifemore than five years after\nit was first eligible to be terminated as a means of awarding money\ndamages to members of the plaintiff class of prisoners. This result is\nseemingly unprecedented in prisoner class action litigation nationwide, is\ncontrary to recent trends in such litigation, and ignores the procedural\ncomplexities that would confront the Circuit Court in determining how to\naward potentially drastic money damages.to 16,662 one-time prisoners of\ntheMilwaukee CountyJail.\n4\n\nI. THE NATURE OF THE CASE, ITS PROCEDURAL\nmSTORY, AND THE DISPOSITIONS BELOW.\nThe plaintiffclass filed this lawsuit in 1996 seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive reliefconcerning conditions that then existed in the Jail. (R.12.)\nThe Circuit Court certified a plaintiff class for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief. The class included all prisoners in the Jail, both then and in the\nfuture. (R.27.) Neither the complaint nor the class certification order\ncontemplated an award ofcompensatory damages. (R.12 & 27.)\nOn June 19, 2001, the Circuit Court approved a negotiated\nsettlement agreement and consent decree (the \"Consent Decree\") initially\nresolving the litigation. (R.161; App. 35-84.)\nOn September 13, 2004, the plaintiffclass filed a motion seeking an\norder finding the County in contempt and in breach of the Consent Decree\nand asking for compensatory damages. (R.240.) After discovery, the\nplaintiffclass renewed its motion on July 29, 2005. (R.254.).\nOn January 4, 2006, the Circuit Court issued a Decision and Order\ndenying plaintiffs' motion. (R.282; App. 21-34.) The Circuit Court\nconcluded that Milwaukee County had acted in contempt by allowing\n16,662 prisoners to remain in the Jail's booking area in excess of30 hours.\n(R.282 at 8; App. 28.) However, considering the request of the plaintiff\nclass for an award ofdamages as a remedial contempt sanction, the Circuit\nCourt concluded that no such remedy was available because the conduct\nunderlying the contempt finding had ceased. (Id.)\n5\n\nOn January 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals issued a published\nDecision reversing the Circuit Court. (App. 1-19.) Relying on Frisch  \nand notwithstanding the fact that any violations of the Consent Decree\nstopped four months before the plaintiff class filed its initial motion for\nrelief- th'e Court ofAppeals concluded that the remedial sanctions set forth\nin Wis. Stat. §785.04(1) are available to plaintiffs because the contempt\nfound by\"theCircuit Court was \"continuing.\" (App. 4 & 19.) According to\nthe Court of Appeals, the contempt was (and is) continuing because the\nprisoners held in the Jail's booking area in excess of 30-hours \"have\nsuffered unremedied injury as a direct result of that noncompliance\" with\nthe ConsentDecree. (Id. 19.)\nRather than remanding to the Circuit Court for a determination in its\ndiscretion of the proper remedial sanction, if any, the Court of Appeals\nremanded with,specific directions that the trial court \"determine . . . the\n'sum of money sufficient to compensate' the prisoners held in violation of\nthe Consent Decree for the 'loss or injury suffered.''' The Court ofAppeals\ngave no guidance to the Circuit'Court on what procedure it was to follow in\nlocating and awarding such damages to each of the 16,662 prisoners in\nquestion. (App. 19.)1\nI The Circuit Court also denied a request by plaintiffs for damages under a breach of\ncontract theory, (R.202 at 1& 9-14; App. 21 & 29-34.) The Court ofAppeals did not\nreach plaintiffs' breachofcontracttheory. (App. 19.)\n6\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS.\nAt the outset of this litigation in 1996, plaintiffs asserted that\nconditions the Jail were deficient under the Wisconsin Constitution.\nIII\nAccording to plaintiffs, these conditions included, among other things,\nserious overcrowding, routine double-ceiling ofinmates, a lack ofpersonal\nsafety and outbreaks of violence, the absence of proper inmate\nclassification, and a substantial lack of access to medical, dental, and\npsychiatric staff and care. (R.l2.) The Consent Decree that initially\nresolved this lawsuit is a complex, forty-eight page document containing\nmyriad provisions relating to population control measures and the medical,\ndental, and psychiatric care ofinmates in the Jail. (R.262, Ex. A; App. 35-\n84.)2 And, despite the problems experienced before May 2004 under a\n2 While at one time conBent decrees were perceived to be an efficient mechanism to\naddress prison conditions, that perception more recently has been changing. Legislators,\nprison officials, and taxpayers have come to bemoan micromanagement ofjails by the\ncourts, the burden on the taxpayers of seemingly never-ending lawsuits, and perpetual\nconsentdecreesthattake on a life oftheir own. Indeed, in 1996PresidentClintonsigned\ninto lawthe Prison Litigation Refonn Act of 1995 (the \"PLRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-134,\n§§ 801-810,110 Stat. 1321-66 to 1321-77 (1996) (codified in sections of 18 U.S.C., 28\nU.S.C., & 42 U.S.C.). Oneofthe stated reasons behind the passage ofthe PLRA was to\ncurtail themicromanagementbythe federal courts in running stateand localjails:\n(N]o longer will prison administration be turned over to\nFederal judges for the indefinite future for the slightest\nreason. Instead, the States [or the appropriate federal\nagency] will be able to run prisons as they see fit unless\nthere is a constitutional violation, in which case a\nnarrowly tailored order to correct the violation may be\nentered.\n141Cong. Rec. S14419 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1995) (statement ofSen. Abraham). As a\nsponsor of the legislation stated: \"[t]he legislation I am introducing today will return\nsanity and Statecontrol to our prison systems. It will do so by limitingjudicial remedies\nin prison cases ... .\" 141 Congo Rec. SI4316 (daily ed. Sept. 26, 1995) (statement of\nSen. Abraham).\n7\n\nsingle provision ofthe Consent Decree - the so-called \"3D-Hour Rule\"  \nthe overall record since the entry of the Consent Decree is one of\nundisputed success by the County in correcting the problems originally\nalleged by plaintiffs and creating a first-class jaiJ.3\nA. The Consent Decree.\n1. Population Control.\nPart I of the Consent Decree, relating to \"Population Limits,\"\ncontains several restrictions on the population of the Jail: (I) the County\nmust maintain the total population of the Jail below 1,100 as measured at\nthe daily 11:59 p.m. prisoner count;4 (2) the County must use its \"best\nefforts\" to ensure that the population ofthe Booking/Open Waiting area of\nthe Jail (the \"BKOW\") is less than 110 as of the 11:59 p.m. count; and\n(3) no prisoner may be held in the BKOW for longer than 30 hours (the\n\"3D-Hour Rule\"). (R.262, Ex. A at 4-5; App. 38-39.) Nothing in national\nstandards, state statutes, or state administrative regulations independently\nsets a standard comparable to the 3D-HourRule. (R.269 ~~ 11 & 13; R.265\n.·P8.)\n3 Creating a first-class jail has not come without a price. The record reflects that,\nbetween 200I and 2003, the dailycostto house an inmateatthe CJF increased31.6%and\nthat the CJF's expenditures as a percentage of the County's tax levy has risen from\n18.19%to 23.27%. (R.271.)\n4 By stipulation of the parties, the total population cap was lowered to 960 for\nremaining life ofPart I effective May 14, 2007. (R.322.) Both the 1,100 and 960 caps\nreflect asubstantial reduction from the population figures in the Jail prior to the Consent\nDecree. (SeegenerallyR.12.)\n8\n\n2. Substantial Compliance (Which Is Not Measured\nBy The 30-Hour Rule).\nThe Consent Decree's population provisions' originally were to\nremain in place for a minimum of two years and, in any event, until the\nCircuit Court determines that the County is in \"substantial compliance\"\nwith the Decree and that \"there is no longer a need for the court's\ninvolvement to prevent future overcrowding.\" (R.262,Ex. A at 5-6; App.\n.39-40.) Under the negotiated terms of the Consent Decree, substantial\ncompliance is measured by three specific factors, none ofwhich relates to\nthe 30-HourRule. (R.262, Ex.A at 5;App. 39.)\n3. Monitoring.\nThe County is required to regularly mail to counsel for the plaintiff\nclass several reports regarding the population ofthe Jail. (R.262, Ex. A at\n6; App. 40.) Further, counsel for plaintiffs have the right to conduct\ninspections ofthe Jail and to have access to county staffunder the Decree.\n(R.262, Ex. A at 6-7; App. 40-41.) The County has satisfied these\nmonitoring obligations since the entry ofthe Consent Decree. (R.262 ~ 10\n& Ex. 1.)5\n4. Remedies For Non-Compliance (Which Do Not\nInclude Damages).\nThe Consent Decree does not authorize compensatory damages for\nviolations of its terms. (R.262, Ex. A at 6; App. 40.) Counsel for the\n5 Counsel for the plaintiffclass was required to prepare semi-annual reports to the\nCircuitCourt indicatingthe status ofthe Counl:)l's .compliancewith the Consent Decree's\npopulation provisions,including the 3D-HourRule, but never did so. (R.262, Ex. A at 6 \n7; App. 40-41; R.262 'If 13.)\n9\n\nplaintiff class expressly acknowledged this fact when advocating for\njudicial approval of the Decree. (R.302 at 4 & 10; R.303 .at 6.) For\n. example, during one settlement hearing, then counsel for the plaintiffclass\nstated:\n[a]s the Court knows, this is a class action, and members\nofthe class are all inmates who are now or in the future\nwill be subject to policies and procedures of the\ndefendants. The relief, asthe Court knows, is injunctive\nrelief, so that it applies to all members of the class.\nThere are nO damages, individual damages sought in\nthiscase.\n(R.303 at 6 (emphasis added).)\nB. The Booking/Open Waiting Area.\n1. Plaintiffs' Allegations Regarding Conditions In The\nBooking Room.\nThe Circuit Court noted that various members of the plaintiff class\nalleged conditions in the BKOW that were \"unacceptable, ifnot appalling,\"\nand the Court ofAppeals quoted at length from the Circuit Court's decision\non this issue. (App. 27 & 7-8.) The County has never conceded that the\nconditions in the BKOW fell below acceptable standards for a major\nmetropolitanjail facility. (R.308 at 22-25.) Indeed, as is described below,\nthe evidence submitted by the County directly disputed many ofthe claims\nmade by the plaintiffclass concerning conditions inthe BKOW.\nHowever the precise nature ofthe conditions in the BKOW (beyond\nthe fact that prisoners were held there longer than permitted by the 30-Hour\nRule) was and is not relevant to theissue ofwhether plaintiffs are entitled,\nas a matter of law, to recover compensatory damages for any contempt on\nthe part of the County. Thus, while the following description of certain\n10\n\naspects of the BKOW provides basic context for the issues before this\nCourt given plaintiffs' allegations, the full nature of the conditions in the\nBKOW can only be.definitively litigated should this case ultimately return\nto the Circuit Court for further proceedings on the question ofdamages.\n2. The Layout And Basic Amenities In Booking.\nThe BKOW is where prisoners entering the Jail are processed and\nheld before they are assigned to space in one of the facility's permanent\nhousing areas or released altogether. (R.267 ~ 3.) The only persons held in\ntheBKOW are those who are lawfully incarcerated, and therehas been no\nallegation by plaintiffs to the contrary.\nThe BKOW contains a large open waiting area surrounded by\nseventeen separate cells, each ofwhich can lawfully accommodate between\nseven and twelve prisoners. The open waiting area contains several rows of\nbenches on which prisoners are permitted to sit. Consistent with state\nregulations, the benches for females are separated from those for males.\n(Id.·~4.)\nThe BKOW is climate controlled, with both heat and arr\nconditioning, and the temperature in the BKOW is consistently maintained\nat roughly seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit. (Id. ~ 5.) Prisoners being held\nin the BKOW have appropriate access to food (including fruit for inmates\nwith special dietary needs), drink, restrooms, phones, and televisions. (Id.\n'll'\\l4-9; R. 265 ~ 13.) It is undisputed that the food offered prisoners in the\nBKOW is consistent with food offered in booking rooms in other jails\nacross the country. (R.265~ 13.)\n11\n\n3. Staffing And Security Measures.\nThe Sheriff's Office uses a \"direct supervision\" model in the BKOW,\nwith some staffstationed at an elevated booking desk and others on foot in\nand among the prisoners. At any given time, between five and nine officers\nand a sergeant are stationed in theBKOW monitoring the inmates.. (R.267\n~ 10.)\nInmates entering the Jail are searched by the agency transferring\ncustody to the Sheriff's Office and then again by Sheriff's personnel. (Id.\n~ 13.) Prisoners' movements are readily observable by Jail personnel at all\ntimes. (Id. ~ 15.) Further, the cells surrounding the open waiting area of\nthe BKOW contain an alarm system so that Jail personnel are alerted in the\nevent ofan emergency. (Id. ~ 16.)\n4. Medical Care.\nUpon admission to the Jail, each prisoner has an initial medical\nscreeningwith a registered nurse. Ifappropriate, the prisoner is directed to\na hospital for medical care. (R.267 ~~ 18 &20; R.266 .~~ 10 & 12.)\nPrisoners have access to medical care during the entire time they are\nin the BKOW. A registered nurse is assigned to the BKOW and is on duty\nat all times..A psychiatric social worker is available in the BKOW sixteen\nhours a day, six days a week. Both a physician and a psychiatrist are\npresent at the Jail on a full-time basis, and aphysician and a psychiatrist are\nalso on call during non-business hours. (R.267 '\\119; R.266 ~ II.)\nIn the BKOW, a nurse conducts a wellness round every four hours.\nEvery two hours, a nurse conducts separate rounds to ensure that prisoners'\n12\n\nhypertension needs are met In addition, medication rounds occur four\n.times daily. Since medical personnel are always available, the BKOW has\nan \"open sick call.\" Prisoners needing nursing evaluations more than two\ntimes a shift are moved to a special housing unit (R.267 ~ 20; R.266\n~ 12.)6\nC. The County's Efforts To Comply With The Decree And\nThe Unanticipated Problems Under The 30-Hour Rule.\nIn the almost seven years since the Consent Decree was entered, the\nCounty has successfully complied with all but one of its multiple\npopulation control provisions. As is now clear, between November 2001\nand April 2004, the County did not ensure that each ofthe roughly 128,000\nprisoners booked into the Jail (aU ofwhom who were properly in the Jail)\nwere moved from the BKOW to housing areas fast enough to comply with\nthe 30-Hour Rule. These violations occurred despite the best efforts ofthe\nCounty to comply with theDecree as awhole.\n6Some ofthe prisoner affidavits offered by plaintiffs before the Circuit Court raised\nissues with respect to the medical care prisoners received in the booking room. (See\nR.256 at Keuffer, Roche, Collins, Evans, Gunnarson, Hyke, Payton, & Ziesmer\nAffidavits.) For instance, AnthonyHyke, who according to public records available on\nthe Wisconsin Circuit Court Access website, was being held in the Jail in April 2003 on\nfelony charges of sexual assault and enticement,of a child and was later convicted of\nfelony child enticement-sexual contact, asserts that he did not receive a prescription\nmedication for acid reflux while he was in the booking room. (See http://wcca.\nwicourts.gov (Milw. Co. Case 2003CF2524); R. 256, Hyke Affidavit.) However, as the\naffidavit offered by the Countyfrom the Jail's Medical Director illustrated, many ofthe\nallegations in these affidavits were incomplete, misleading and, in some respects, simply\nfalse. (R.273,) These factual issues need to be resolved atthe CircuitCourt level only if\nthe plaintiffclass is entitled to compensatorydamages underChapter785.\n13\n\n1. The County's Focus On The Population Caps.\nFollowing the entry of the Consent Decree; the County and the\nSheriff made compliance with the population control provisions a high\npriority. First and foremost, the Sheriffmade every effort to keep the total\npopulation ofthe Jail below 1,100 (and, since May 2004, below 960). By\nkeeping the facility population within the cap set by the Consent Decree,\nthe Sheriff's Office intendeq to maintain its ability to move inmates through\nthe BKOW in greater numbers and at a quicker pace so as to stay in\ncompliance with the BKOW population cap and the 30-Hour Rule. (R.262,\nEx. Hat 26-27.)\nAs Deputy Inspector Jerianne Feiten, who was assigned to run the\nJail between late 2002 and early 2004, testified:\nOrally or in writing, everyday it was reinforcedthat we\nwould do - make every feasible attempt possible to\nreduce facility population. By reducing facility\npopulation, that would open up beds upstairs to which\nthose beds would be filled from the booking room. So\nthat would be a cycle thatwould be going on and looked\nat on a constant basis on all three shifts. So in that way\nwe were looking to move people out of booking as\nquickly as possible.\nIfI don't have any beds available, I don't have any way\nto move anyone out of booking. So at the timeI was\nassigned to the jail, population was always extremely\nhigh. Focus onbooking came viareducingpopulationin\nany way possible, because then we could move people\nfrom bookingupstairs.\n(Id.) As Deputy Inspector Feiten further testified:\nSo I worked endlessly at figuring out ways to either\nreduce the population or to prevent taking in any more\ninmates. So therefore, itwould be a trickle down effect.\nI couldmove peopleout ofbooking. I could movethem\n14\n\nout.faster, and if I did that trickle down effect they\nwould be in the booking room lessthan30 hours.\n(Jd. at 102.)\n2. Outside Pressures And Limitations On The\nCounty's Compliance With The Decree.\nHowever, the County's ability tocomply with the population control\nprovisions ofthe Consent Decree, including the overall population cap and\nthe 30-Hour Rule, has always been significantly impacted by pressures and\nlimitations that are outside its control. In fact, the COUIity has no control\nover the number of prisoners arrested and brought to the Jail by the\nmunicipalities it serves, including the City of Milwaukee. (R.267 ~ 21.)\nMoreover, in the past, the County had only limited control over the number\nof state prisoners the Jail was required to accept on probation or parole\nviolation holds (so-called \"YOPs\"). (Jd. ~22.) Likewise, the County has\nno control over the rate at whiCh prisoners are processed through the\ncriminaljustice system and, ultimately, cleared for release or transfer. (Id.\n~ 23.)\n,\nNonethtdess, following t~e entry ofthe Consent Decree, the County\nsuccessfully kept the total population ofthe Jail below the caps imposed by\nthe Decree. To do so, the County relied, among other things, on contacts\nwith the Milwaukee County House of Correction (\"HOC\") to open\nadditional dorms to house prisoners from the Jail, contacts with court\nrepresentatives to secure lowered bail amounts and earlier releases, contacts\nwith the Department ofCorrections to slow or stop the influx ofYOPs, and\nattempts to stop or at least control the flow ofprisoners cominginto the Jail\n15\n\nfrom otherlocal law enforcement agencies. (R.262, Ex. H at 26-27, 31-33,\n62, 68, 72, & 102.)\n. 3. The Jail's Objective Classification System.\nTo avoid assignments that will cause safety and security risks, the\nJail uses a classification system to assign prisoners to various housing areas\nbased on a series of objective factors (such as age, sex, criminal history,\npending or sentenced charge, escape history,. institutional disciplinary\nhistory, alcohol or drug abuse history, and various stability factors). (R.267\n.~ 24.) This objective classification system is an accepted modem-day\ncorrections practice.\nHowever, with this objective classification system in place, the Jail\n. is never able tcassign prisoners to each ofthe 990 beds in the facility, as it\nnever has theperfect mix ofprisoners. Forinstance, males and females do\nnot enter the system in perfect 64-person groups, so the male and female\nhousing units can rarely be filled to the maximum. Likewise, the Jail can\nnever count on a full complement of sick or injured prisoners for the\ninfirmary, prisoners with disciplinary problems for Pod 4D, or prisoners\nwith mental health problems for the special needs unit. As a result, even\nwhen thetotal population ofthe Jail was below 1,100, the Jail staffstill was\nnot able to move prisoners out of the BKOW to fill all 990 beds in the\nfacility. (Id. ~ 25; R.262, Ex.H at69-71.)\nIn this fashion, the original total population cap of 1,100 set by the\nDecree, when it was implemented in the context of the Jail's objective\nclassification system, allowed for a situation where the County was not\n16\n\nalways able to comply·with the 30-Hour Rule even when it met·its\nobligationto keep the total population ofthe Jail under the cap.\n4. The Resulting Problems Under The 30-Hour Rule.\nUltimately, the officials running the Jail were so focused on keeping\nthe overall population of the Jail below the 1,100 figure that they did not\nensure that each prisoner stayed in the BKOW for fewer than thirty hours.\n(R.262, Ex. H ~t 49 & 68.) Roughly 111,400 (or 87% ofthe approximately\n128,000 prisoners booked between November 2001 and April 2004) were\ntimely processed through the BKOW, and roughly 16,600 (or 13% of the\ntotal) were not. (App. 23-24; R.267 \"1130.) However, while the Circuit\nCourt concluded that the conduct ofthe County was intentional as a matter\noflaw, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that the Jail's command\nstaffactuallyhad knowledge that the number of30-Hour violations was as\nhigh as is now known. As Deputy Inspector Feiten explained in her\ntestimony:\nAgain, all ofmy concentration was on reducing facility\npopulation so that therefore I could move people out of\nbooking. Yes, I was aware at times people were in\nbooking for extended periods of time. But as far as\ntrying to generalize it and say it was routine - I was\nmore concerned with dealing with facility population,\nwhich in turn trickles down to bookingroom population.\nI'm just surprised. We struggled with the population\nlanguage you have in that settlement everyday, and on\nmost days we were in total compliance. And ifIwas in\ncompliance there, Iwould maybe erroneously assumed I\nwas in compliance in other places. But again, \"I\nconcentrated on total facility population, because if I\nwasn'twithinthose guidelines it's a domino effect.\n(R.262, Ex. H at 49 & 68.)\n17\n\nFurther, when counsel for the plaintiff class first asked questions in\nmid- to late-2003 about information regarding the length oftime prisoners\nwere spending in the BKOW, the County mistakenly relied on computer \ngenerated data reflecting the average time spent in BKOW rather than the\n,underlying raw information. This data regarding average stays in BKOW\nsuggested that the County was well within the parameters of the Consent\nDecree in this respect and did not revealthe nature or extent ofthe problem.\n(Id., Ex. K at 69-70 & 135-38.) Only later, when the datathat was provided\nto the Circuit Court in April 2004 was specially generated, was the full\nextent ofthe problem known. (Id., Ex. H at 49 & 68;Id., Ex. K at 70-75.)\n5. The Probl~ms Under The 30-Hour Rule Did Not\nLead To An Increase In Serious Disciplinary\nIncidents Or Other Problems In The Eyes OfThe\nState Jail Inspector.\nImportantly, it is undisputed that the fact that numerous prisoners\nremained too long in the BKOW did not lead to an increase in serious\ndisciplinary incidents. In fact, according to Dr. Stan Stojkovic, Dean ofthe\nSchool of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and\nDr. Rick Lovell, Chair of UWM's Department ofCriminal Justice, the\nnumber ofprisoners transferred from the BKOW to the Jail's Pod 4D (used\nfor disciplinary problems), both before and after the Sh5:riff fixed the\n30-Hour problem in April 200~, was extremely low when compared to the\ntotal number of persons booked into the Jail. Moreover, there was no\nsubstantive difference in the numbers of prisoners transferred to Pod 4D\n18\n\nbefore the April 2004 solution versus the numbers similarly transferred\nafter April 2004. (R.264.)\nIn addition, Walt Morzy, a Detention Facilities Specialist with the\nDepartment ofCorrections, never observe<tan overcrowding problem in the\nBKOW during his numerous, at times unannounced, inspections in the\nperiod between November 2001 and April 2004. (R.264; R.269.) In fact,\nMorzy believes that since the entry of the Consent Decree, the Jail has\nmade tremendous strides, particularly in providing health services to\ninmates. (R.269~~ II & 13.)7 Further, the County's expert jail consultant\nalso confinned that the BKOW posed no substantial risk of harm to\nprisoners and was superiorto others he hastoured. (R.265.)\nD. The Solution Implemented By The County In April 2004.\nWhen the County realized in April 2004 that a significant number of\nprisoners had been held in the BKOW for longer than thirty hours, it\nimmediately corrected the problem. It did so by unilaterally instituting a\nselfcimposed total population' cap of 960 at the Jail and by freeing\nadditional funding to use dorms at the HOC as overflow space. (R.262,\nEx. K at 148-49 & 155; R.267 ~~ 26-27.)\nThis self-imposed cap went beyond the provisions of the Consent\nDecree, and it corrected the disconnect described above between the\n7 Overall, the County also has successfully complied with its obligations under the\nlengthy portions ofthe Consent Decreerelatingto the provision ofhealth care in the Jail.\n(See R.262, Ex. A at Part II.) This was confirmed by the testimony of Dr. Ronald\nShansky, a nationally-renowned expert in correctional medicine who was appointed as\nthe Medical Monitor underthe Decree afterhaving served as the expert for the plaintiff\nclass. (ld, Ex. J at 11-18,21,48, & 57.)\n19\n\npopulation control measures and the objective classification system ofthe\n-Jail. By following t!J.is self-imposed cap of960 beginning in May 2004, the\nSheriff has been able to guarantee the flexibility to house prisoners in the\nJail using the objective classification system and still avoid the backlog of\nprisoners in the BKOW awaiting assignment to a permanent housing area\nthat led to the 30-hour problems experienced between November 200I and\nApril 2004. (R. 267 ~ 27.)\nIn addition, the Jail now monitors daily how long each prisoner in\nthe BKOW has been there in an effort to prevent any future reoccurrence of _\nproblems under the3O-HourRule. (Id. ~ 28.)\nEo Current Compliance By The County.\nSiilce 2001, the -County has successfully maintained the overall\npopulation of the Jail within the caps set by the Consent Decree. Indeed,\nthe population of the Jail (with one exception, September 12, 2002, when\nthe population measured at 11:59 p.m. was 1105) did not exceed the 1,100\ntotal cap set by the Consent Decree between November 2001 and August\n2005 (the end point for the data in the record on this issue). (R.267 ~ 32 &\nEx. A.) This is true despite the fact that the Jail handled on average 50,000\nbookings per year (and roughly 190,000 in total) during this forty-six\nmonth time period. (Id. ~ 32.)\nLikewise, the County has successfully used its best efforts to\nno\nmaintain ·,thepopulation of the BKOW within the cap for the\n11:59 p.m. count. SpecificallY,from November 2001 to August 2005, the\n20\n\npopulation ofthe BKOW was below 110 at the 11:59 p.m. count 93.4% of\nthe time. (Id. ~ 33 & Ex. C.)\nFinally, it is uncontested that the County has successfully operated\nthe Jail and the BKOW since June 2004 in such a way as tonot violate the\n30-Hour Rule. In fact, of the 118,571 prisoners booked into the Jail\nbetween June 2004 and October 2006 (the last data contained in the record\non this issue), a mere forty-eight (or 0.04% of the total) were held in the\nBKOW for longer than twenty-four hours. More importantly, none was\nheld in theBKOW for more than thirty hours. (Id. ~ 36& Ex. A; R.298\n~ 4.)\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nQuestions about the interpretation and application of a statute are\nquestions of law that this Court reviews independent of the lower courts.\nSee, e.g., Beard v. Lee Enters., Inc., 225 Wis.2d 1, 9, 591 N.W.2d 156\n(1999).\nARGUMENT\nI. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONCLUDING\nTHAT THE CONTEMPT STATUTE PERMITS AN AWARD\nOF DAMAGES AS. A REMEDIAL SANCTION FOR PAST\nVIOLATIONS OF THE 30cHOUR RULE.\nA. Chapter 785 Does Not Permit An Award Of Damages As\nA Remedial Sanction For A Past Contempt.\n1. Remedial Sanctions CannotBe Imposed Unless The\nContemptIs Continning.\nAs enacted by the Wisconsin Legislature, Chapter 785 permits two\nseparate types of sanctions for contemptuous behavior. A \"'[p]unitive\n21\n\nsanction' means a sanction imposed to punish a past contempt of court for\nthe purpose ofupholding the authority ofthe court.\" Wis. Stat. § 785.01(2).\nA \"'[r]emedial sanction' means a sanction imposed for the purpose of\nterminating a continuing contempt of court.\" Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3).\nImportantly, \"[t]he remedies authorized by statute are the exclusive\nremedies available, and punitive sanctions may not be imposed in remedial\nsanction proceedings.\" State ex reI. N.A. v. G.s., 156 Wis. 2d 338,341,456\nN.W.2d 867 (et. App. 1990).8\nAccordingly, a trial court must determineifthe contemnor's conduct\nstill continuing before imposing a remedial sanction in a contempt\nIS\nproceeding. If the conduct has ceased, there is no ongoing contempt to\ncorrect. See King, 82 Wis. 2d at 130; Luebke, 2003 WI App 207, \"!I 22; see\nalso Benn, 230 Wis.2d at 309 (describing remedial sanctions as being\ndesigned \"to procure present and future compliance with court orders\")\n(emphasis added); Schroeder v.· Schroeder, 100 Wis.2d 625, 637, 302\nN.W.2d 475 (1981) (observing that \"[c]ivil contempt looks to the present\nand future\" and discussing \"remedial\" purpose ofsanctions not in the sense\nof being purely compensatory but in the sense of being \"coercive, i.e.,\ndesigned to force one party to accede to another's demand\").\nIn keeping with this principle, the explanatory notes offered by the\ncommittee that drafted the current version of the contempt statute provide\n. as follows:\n8As the Court ofAppeals correctly observed, punitive sanclions are not at issue in\nthis case. (App. 10.)\n22\n\nTraditionally, a remedial sanction was the type\n.ofsanction imposed for civil contempt. The purpose of\nthe sanction was remedial in that it was designed to\nforce aperson into complyingwith an orderofthe court\nand terminating a present contempt of court. That\nconcept is continued here, even though without the civil\ncontempt designation. The definition makes it clear that\na remedial sanction is appropriate only when the\ncantempt is continuing, andcannotbe imposediffor any\nreason the contempt has ceased, even as a result ofthe\nsettlementofthecase.\nWis. Stat. Ann. §785.01, Comments - L. 1979, c.257, § 11, at 412 (West\n2001) (emphasis added).\nAs defined by the Legislature, remedial sanctions for contempt\ninclude \"[p]ayment ofa sum ofmoney sufficient to compensate a party for\na loss or injury suffered by the party as the result ofa contempt ofcourt.\"\nWis. Stat. §785.04(1)(a). But, while remedial sanctions may include the\npayment ofmoney, even for a past loss, this is only true when a continuing\ncontempt exists and the contempt is purgeable. This is made clear not only\nby the definition of \"remedial sanction\" contained in § 785.01(3) as\ndescribed above, but also by the catch-aU provision of §785.04(1)(e),\nwhich specifies that any other sanction imposed by a trial court, like those\nenumerated in subsections (a) through (d), must be directed at\n\"terminat[ing] a continuing contempt ofcourt.\" Thus, the Court ofAppeals\nerred in construing the text of§785.04(1) as indicating that the Legislature\nwas authorizing the imposition of compensatory damages as a remedial\nsanction for apast contempt ofcourt. (See App. 11.)\n23\n\n2. A .Past Contempt' Is Not Continuing Simply\nBecause A Harm Caused By The Contempt\nRemains Uncompensated.\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, the contempt statute provides\nremedies for contempt \"which are aimed at ending the harm to the victim\nresulting from noncompliance with the order.\" (App. 10.) Traditionally,\nhowever, remedial contempt sanctions have been viewed as a means to\nforce the contemnor to terminate a continuing course of conduct that\nconstitutes contempt of a court order, not as a means to end a harm\noccasionedfrom past noncompliance with the order. See, e.g., Frisch, 2007\nW1102, ~ 35 (noting that \"[aj remedial sanction ... is civil and is 'imposed\nfor the purpose ofterminating a continuing contempt ofcourt\"') (emphasis\nomitted) (quoting Wis. Stat. §785.01(3)); King, 82 Wis.2d at 130\n(contrasting civil contempt, which \"looks to the present and future and the\ncivil contemnor holds the key to his jail confinement by compliance with\nthe order,\" with criminal contempt, where the \"contemnor is brought to\naccount for a completed past action\"); Diane K.J. v. James L.J., 196\nWis. 2d 964,968,539 N.W.2d 703 (Ct. App. 1995) (noting that \"[r]emedial\ncontempt is imposed to ensure compliance with court orders\").\nThe three family law cases discussed at length by the Court of\nAppeals - Griffin v. Reeve, 141 Wis. 2d 699, 416 N.W.2d 612 (1987); State\n.ex reI. Larsen v. Larsen, 165 Wis.2d 679, 478 N.W.2d 18 (1992); and\nLuebke, 2003 WI App 207 - do not stray from this accepted interpretation\nof the contempt statute and the purposes underlying remedial contempt\nsanctions.\n24\n\nFor instance, in Griffin, the Supreme Court considered a\ncircumstance where the subject ofa court order failed to make child support\n_payments under the order. 141 Wis.2d at 701-02. At the time of the\ncontempt motion, the child support payments were still past due even\nthough the child in question had reached the age eighteen. Id. at 701.\n.Accordingto the Court:\n.-\nWhile the court may not modifY or terminate the support\norder after the child reaches majority, the force of the\norder does not expire until the parent complies. A\nparent's failure to pay child support after the child\nreaches majority is a continuing disobedience ofa court\norder. The contemptis notpast; it is ongoing.\nId. at 708.\nAs the Court ofAppeals noted here, the Griffin Court also went on\nto observe generally that \"[a] dominant purpose ofthe contempt proceeding\nis to aid the private litigant.\" Id. The aid to the litigant in Griffin, however,\nwas not to cori',pensate the aggrieved party for a past, completed harm, but\nwas instead to provide \"a mechanism to effect compliance with the court-\n_ordered duty to support.\" Id.\nIn Larsen, the trial court found Gaylon Larsen in contempt for\nfailing to make child support payments. 165 Wis.2d at 681. As an\nalternative to servingjail time as a remedial sanction, the trial court granted\nLarsen the opportunity to purge the contempt by seeking work and\nobtaining psychiatric'treatment. Id. Larsen challenged the treatment\ncondition. Id. at 682-83. This Court responded to Larsen's arguments by\nobserving that the treatment requirement was only a-purge condition,\nexercisable at his will, rather than a remedial sanction. Id. at 683-85. A\n25\n\ngiven the Court's discussion, however, was the fact that Larsen's\nIII\nunderlying conduct - his failure to make child support payments - was, in\nfact, still ongoing. Id. at 681-82.\nLikewise, in Luebke, the Court of Appeals considered a contempt\nfinding against a guardian act litem who hact failed to comply with a court\norder directing her to place the proceeds from a minor settlement in trust\nuntil the minors in question reached the age ofeighteen. 2003 WI App 207,\n\"3-4. In considering the various sanctions imposed by the trial court, the\nCourt of Appeals expressly noted that the guardian's contempt was still\nongoing:\nWashington's allegedly contemptuous act or omission\nwas her alleged failure to deposit, or see to the deposit\nof, the minors' settlement proceeds in restricted accounts\nas ordered by the court. So long as no properly\nrestricted accounts containing the settlement proceeds\nexisted, heralleged contemptcontinued.\nId. , 22. Thus, while the Court of Appeals may have gone on to uphold\nmonetary remedial sanctions, there was no question that the underlying\ncontempt was still continuing at the time the sanctions were imposed. Id.\n, 27. Significantly, nowhere inLuebke is any discussion ofthe idea that the\nsanctions were authorized solely for the purpose of compensating the\nchildren for any harms suffered as a result ofthe guardian's contemptuous\nconduct, regardless ofwhether the conduct was continuing.\n3. Frisch Did Not Alter 'fhe Requirement That The\nConduct Underlying The ContemptBe Continuing.\nIn Frisch, the trial court found Ronald Henrichs in contempt for\nfailing to timely provide tax and income information to his former wife,\n26\n\nHeidi Frisch, pursuant to state statute, their divorce judgment, and a court\norder, and ordered him to pay the. sum of $100,000 to 'Frisch as\ncompensation. 2007 WI 102; ~~ 1, 2, & 23. The Court of Appeals\nreversed, concluding that the $100,000 award was improper because the\ncontempt was no longer continuing at the time of the contempt hearing\nbecause it believed Henrichs had supplied the required information\nimmediately prior to the hearing. Id. ~~ 3& 26..\nThe Supreme Court reversed again, reinstating the compensatory\naward. Id. ~ 4. According to the Court, Henrichs' contempt was continuing\nbecause his long-standing failure to timely provide the income information\nenabled him to avoid any modifications to his child support obligations. Id.·\nContrary to the reasoning ofthe Court ofAppeals in the case at bar,\nFrisch does not stand for the overly-broad proposition that all \"unremedied\ninjuries\" suffered as a result of contempt constitute continuing contempt\nunder §785.01(3) regardless of whether the underlying contemptuous\nconduct is still ongoing. According to the Court in Frisch, the circuit\ncourt's support order required not just the production of the income\ninformation, but its timely production each year that child support was due.\nId. ~ 47. Otherwise, absent timely production of the income information,\nHenrichs was able effectively to avoid being subject to court-ordered\nmodifications of his child support obligations. Id. UltimatelY, by not\nproviding the required information, the Court observed, Henrichs deprived\nFrisch of her ability to ever seek such modifications for the years in\nquestion. Id. ~~47 & 77. As a result, according to the Court, Frisch and\n27\n\nher children \"lost their traditional remedy\" and \"cannot be made whole\"\nbecause of Henrichs' contempt. Absent such a remedy, the Court\nconcluded that the contempt remained continuing. Id. ~~ 47, 62, & 81.\nAs the Court noted, the circumstances in Frisch were \"unusual\" and·\nwere rooted in the unique interplay between Chapter 785 and the family\nlaw provisions of Chapter 767. Id. ~~ 40-49, 62, & 81-82. According to\nthe Court, \"[b]ecause.Ronald could not and did not turn back time when he\nproduced the rcquired information too late to be acted on, his contempt was\nand is continuing within the legislative directive of Wis. Stat.\n.§ 767.27(2m).\" Id. ~ 81 (emphasis added).\nHowever, the decision does not extend to all situations where a past\ncontempt has allegedly caused a harm that might be remedied through other\nexisting avenues of relief, whether constitutional, .common law, or\nstatutory. Such a reading of Frisch would remove the decision from its\nparticular facts and family law context and result in a broad rule that all\nacts of contempt would be continuing for the purposes of § 785.01(3)  \neven if they had ceased before a· contempt motion was ever brought  \nunless and until any alleged harm caused by the contempt was remedied by\na damages award under § 785.04(1). Such a reading of Frisch would\nrender the text of § 785.01(3) meaningless insofar as it limits remedial\ncontempt to continuing acts ofcontempt.\n28\n\nB.Here,The Contempt Found By The Circuit Court Was\nAnd Is Not Continuing, Even Under Frisch.\nIt is undisputed that the,problems with theCounty's implementation\nofthe 30-Hour Rule were resolved months before plaintiffs ever filed their\ninitial contempt motion, had not reoccurred by the time the Circuit Court\nissued its ruling on contempt, and have never again been an issue (more\nthan four years later). In fact, although roughly 50,000 prisoners are\n.booked into the Iail each year, no violations of the 30-Hour Rule have\noccurred since May 2004. (R.267 ~ 36 & Ex. A; R.298 ~ 4.) As a result,\nChapter 78S's plain language and the controlling authority discussed above\nall establish there was no continuing contempt at issue before the Circuit\nCourt and no basis for the imposition of a remedial sanction such as\ncompensatory damages.\nThis is true even under the holding ofFrisch. Unlike the appellant\nin Frisch, plaintiffs are not in a position where the contempt has deprived\nthem ofany existing remedy under the law for any alleged harm, either as\nindividuals or, should the law permit, as a class. As a result, in contrast to\nthe contemnor's former spouse in Frisch, plaintiffs have not \"lost their\n. traditional remedy.\" As such, the holding of Frisch does not dictate the\nconclusion advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by the Court ofAppeals.\nII. FRISCHSHOULD NOT BE APJ>LIED RETROACTIVELY TO\nTHIS CASE.\nI~WisC{)nsin,there are three factors a court considers in determining\nwhether a new judicial holding should be applied retroactively. First, does\nthe holding \"establish a new principle oflaw, either by overruling clear past\n29\n\nprecedent on which litigants may have relied, or by deciding an issue of\nfirst impression whose resolution was not cleady foreshadowed\"? Kurtz v.\nCity a/Waukesha, 91 Wis.2d 103, 109,280 N.W.2d 757 (1979). Second,\n\"[w]ill retroactive operation further or retard the operation of the judicial\nholding in question?\" Trinity Petroleum, Inc. v. Scott Oil Co., 2007 WI 88,\n\"1177,302 Wis. 2d 299,735 N.W.2d 1. Third, \"[w]ill retroactive application\nproduce substantial inequitable results? Ifthese factors are met, thejudicial\nholding in question should not be applied retroactively.\" Id. (footnote\nomitted).\nHere, the Court of Appeals raised the issue of whether Frisch  \nwhich was decided eighteen months after the Circuit Court's January 2006\nfinding ofcontempt and more than three years after the violations ofthe 30 \nHour Rule stopped- should be applied retroactively to this case sua sponte,\ndeciding that it should because it was only a \"further explanation of the'\nscope of [the contempt statute], rather than announcement of new law.\"\n(App. 16 & n.6.) This was error.\nFirst, given the plain language of§§ 785.01(3) and 785.04(1), and in\nlight of prior precedent repeatedly referencing the need for contemptuous\nconduct to be continuing in order to justifY remedial sanctions, Frisch's\nholding was an extension ofthe law of contempt that was not forecast by\nprior precedent. None of the cases discussed above or in the Court of\nAppeals' decision imposed a remedial contempt sanction where the\nunderlying conduct had ceased at the time of the trial court's contempt\nfinding. Certainly no prior published decision expressly held, like Frisch,\n30\n\nthat remedial contempt sanctions could be imposed where the underlying\nconduct had stopped but the victim ofthe contempt had lost all traditional\nrecourse to recover for any losses suffered as a result thereof.\nSecond, the retroactive application of Frisch will not further the\napplication ofthe new rule announced therein. As noted above, the purpose\nunderlying all remedial conteJ;Ilpt sanctions is to coerce present and future\ncompliance with court orders. Frisch's extension of the concept of what\nconstitutes a \"continuing contempt\" will not further this purpose with\nrespect to cases arising before its holding was announced, as the\ncontemptuous conduct at issue in those cases will necessarily have already\nstopped in order for the ruling to even apply.\nThird, retroactive application cif Frisch will work substantial\ninequitable results. Plaintiffs did not request compensatory damages in\ntheir complaint, the plaintiff class was not certified for damages, and the\nnegotiated Consent Decree purposefully omitted damages as a remedy for\nany violations thereof. (R.282 at 11-14; App. 22 & 32-33.) Nonetheless,\nthe County is now faced with the inequitable result ofa Court ofAppeals\ndecision directing the Circuit Court to impose potentially drastic financial\nsanctions on the taxpayers of Milwaukee County based solely on judicial\nauthority decided three years after the fact and announcing a new rule of\nlaw.\nIn making this argument, the County does not suggest - as has been\nargued by plaintiffs - that it should be free to flaunt the requirements ofthe\nConsent Decree with impunity so long as it can stop before a court\n31\n\nintervenes.· As is described abuve, the County has consistently worked to\ncomply with the myriad provisions of the Consent Decree since its entry\nseven years ago. Also, the record does not suggest that the County\npurposefully evaded compliance with the Consent Decree, relenting only\nupon imminent threat of a monetary· sanction. Ultimately, once it\ndiscovered the problem in its implementation of the 30-Hour Rule, the\nCounty on its own adopted restrictions with respect to the operation ofthe\nJail that were stricter than those set forth in the Decreeand which imposed\na financial burden on the taxpayers ofMilwaukee County. (R.262, Ex. K.\n. .\nat 148-49 & 155; R.267 ~ 26.) Likewise, the County voluntarily agreed in\nMay 2007 to make those restrictions permanent for the remainder ofthe life\n.ofthe Decree'.s population provisions, to extend the period before which it\ncould seek to terminate the Decree, and to comply with tighter reporting\nrequirements under the Decree. (R.322.) In short, .the County has not\nescaped the consequences of its past failure to comply with the 30-Hour\nRule. It should not be held further responsible, however, under a rule of\nlaw first announced more than three years after it cured its failings under\nthe 30-HourRule.\nIII. IF THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY APPLIED\nFRISCH, THE MAJORITY'S HOLDING IN FRISCH\nSHOULD BE REEXAMINED.\nUnder the doctrine ofstare decisis, this Court has the authority only\nunder limited circumstances to overrule its prior holdings. . Johnson\nControls, Inc. v. Employers Ins., 2003 WI 108, ~~ 94-100,264 Wis. 2d 60,\n665N.W.2d 257. However, as this Court has reasoned:\n32\n\n,Stare decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable\nrule, We do more damage to the rule of law by\nobstinately refusing to admit errors, therebyperpetuating\ninjustice, than byoverturningan erroneous decision,\nId. ~ 100 (citation omitted). Thus, among the questions that must be\nconsidered in deciding whether to depart from a prior decision are \"whether\nthe prior decisIon is unsound in principle\" and \"whether it is unworkable in\npractice.\" Id. ~~ 99; see also Dairyland Greyhound Park, Inc, v, Doyle,\n2006 WI 107,~ 93,295 Wis. 2d 1, 7l9N.W.2d 408.\nIfthe Court ofAppeals was correct in reading Frisch as holding that\na contempt is necessarily continuing as long as \"the victim(s) of the\nnoncompliance have suffered unremedied injury as a direct result of that\nnoncompliance\" (see App. 19), then Frisch represents an unsound,\nunworkable departure from the law of contempt that must be reexamined\nby this Court. Again, under such an interpretation of remedial contempt\npowers, there would be no principled or workable way to distinguish\ncontempt that has ceased from contempt that is continuing - rather, all\ncontempt would be continuing absent compensation from the contemnor to\nthe victim. This is not supported by the plain language ofthe statute itself,\nis not consistent with prior precedent focusing on the purposes behind\nremedial contempt remedies, and transforms remedial sanctions from a\ncoercive tool designed to ensure present and future compliance with court\nordersinto an all-purpose tort remedy for past contempt.\nJustice Butler,joined by Justice Bradley, warned of exactly such a\nconsequence in his concurrence in Frisch:\n33\n\nI write separately because the majority opinion does\nviolence to the law of remedial contempt when\napplication of accepted principles of contempt law will\ndo. In my view, the majority opinion distorts beyond\nrecognition the meaning of\"continuing contempt\" under\nWis. Stat. §785.0I(3) by holdingthat a failure to meet a\ndeadlineconstitutes a \"continuingcontempt\" ofcourt.\n2007 WI 102, ~ 84 (Butler, J., concurring). Believing that the record\ndemonstrated that Henrichs' contemptuous conduct in fact was continuing\n(through his ongoing efforts to shield his true income from the court and his\nformer wife), Justice Butler suggested that the majority was \"shoehorn[ing]\nthe concept of 'continuing contempt' under Wis. Stat. §785.01(3) to fit its\nview ofthe facts\" and that its \"definition of'continuing' invents a new legal\nfiction to reach a desired outcome.\" Id. ~~ 100-01. As a result, Justice\nButler warned, \"another law, the law of unintended consequences, is likely\nto impact future cases involving contempt orders issued under § 785.01(3).\"\nId. ~ 101.9\nIV. IF THE' COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY APPLIED\nFRISCH, IT NONETHELESS ERRED IN MANDATING\nTHAT THE CIRCUIT COURT AWARD DAMAGES.\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, the issue before it was only\n\"whether financial sanctions may be imposed to purge the contempt found\nby the trial court in this case.\" (App. 9 (emphasis added).) Even the Circuit\nCourt did not state that it had concluded that compensatory damages would\n9In dissent, ChiefJnstice Abrahamson noted the disagreement on whether Henrichs'\nconduct was ongoing and reasoned that the Court should remand for the trial court to\nenter a specific finding on whether he continued to shirk his obligations to the court and\nhis spouse. 2007 WI 102,'If III (Abrahamson, C.J., dissenting).\n34\n\nbe necessary and appropriate butfor the statutory limit on such damages in .\ncases where the contempt is continuing. (R.282 at 8-9; App.28-29.)\nGiven the limited issue presented on appeal, the Court of Appeals\nerred in directing - once it concluded that damages were an available\nsanction under § 785.04(1) - that the Circuit Court determine on remand\nthe \"sum of money sufficient to compensate\" any prisoners held in the\nbooking area ofthe Jail in excess ofthirty hours. (App. 19.) The Court of\nAppeals erred in this respect because its directive eliminated any discretion\non the part of the Circuit Court in determining the proper remedy, if any,\namong those available to it under §785.04(I)(a)-(e).\nWithout question, the authority of a trial court to use its contempt\npower, including the deciSion ofwhich remedial sanction, ifany, to impose,\nis discretionary. See, e.g., City ofWis. Dells v.Dells Fireworks, Inc., 197\nWis.2d 1,23,539 N.W.2d 916 (CL App. 1995); N.A., 156 Wis. 2d at 341.\nThis discretion is embodied in the plain language of the contempt statute\nitself, as § 785.04(1) spells out that a trial court \"may impose one or more\nof the ... [enumerated] remedial sanctions\" or any another sanction\ndesigned by the trial court itselfifthose laid out in the statutewould not be\neffective in terminating a continuing contempt of court. Even plaintiffs\nacknowledged this discretion and the other remedies available before the\nCircuit Court. (R.277 at 2 n. 2.) The Court ofAppeals' ruling completely\nusurps this inherent discretion in directing that the Circuit Court impose a\nspecific sanction upon remand.\n35\n\nThis point is underscored by the fact that research reveals no other\ndecision - in Wisconsin or elsewhere in the United States - that has\nactually required that compensatory damages be paid directly to a class of\nprisoners solely for past violations of a decree. Plaintiffs cited to no such\ncases in their briefs before the Gourt ofAppeals, and the Court ofAppeals\noffered no authority specific to this context, let alone a decision providing\nfor an award of damages directly to a plaintiff class of prisoners based\nsolely on past violations of a consent decree.lO Indeed, while numerous\ndecisions have directed that damages be paid to a plaintiffclass ofprisoners\nas part of the initial entry ofa consent decree or as liquidated damages for\nfuture violations of a decree, and others have directed that the party\nviolating a jail consent decree pay money into a fund for the improvement\nof conditions in the jail, research reveals none that has imposed the\npayment of compensatory damages directly to a class of prisoners as a\n10Plaintiffs citedto two Cases in their initial bri~fbefore the CourtofAppeals for the\nproposition that prisoners are entitled to compensation ifthey suffer harm as a result ofa\nviolation ofa court order regarding the conditions oftheir confinement. (See Plaintiff \nAppellants' Br. at 9.) However, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691 (1978), concerned\nonlyan award offees to counsel for prison inmates based on a finding ofbadfaith on the\npart ofofficials in failing to correct unconstitutional prison conditions. Further, in Carty\nv. Farrelly, 957 F. Supp. 727, 747-48 (D.V.I. 1997), the court deferred a ruling on the\nissue ofwhetherthe defendants should pay monetary sanctions for violations ofa prison\nconsent decree and instead directed only that they pay the plaintiff prisoners' attorney's\nfees. As discussed below, the district courtsubsequently denied the request for monetary\nsanctions in Carty v. Schneider, 986 F. Supp. 933, 939-40 (D.V.I. 1997). Plaintiffs also\ncited to a number of other cases for the proposition that prisoners'are entitled under\ncertain circumstances to compensatory damages for having to endure unconstitutional\nconditions of confinement, but all but one of the referenced cases involved a claim or\nclaims for damages directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or on a mass tort theory. The sole\nexception, Bohannon v. Hopper, No. 98-0275-RV-S, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5834, at *2 \n3 (S.D. Ala. April 17, 2000), involved a consent decree agreed upon by the parties that\nincluded the payment ofdamages to the plaintiffclass. (See Plaintiff-Appellants' Br. at\n16n. 8.)\n36\n\nsanction for past, concluded violations of a consent decree absent a purge\n.condition that would allow prison officials to avoid the sanction. See, e.g.,\nEssex County Jail Inmates v. Amato, 726 F. Supp. 539, 542-44 & 548-49\n(D.N.J. 1989) (as part ofconsent decree, parties stipulated to per prisoner,\nper day fine for population violations to create bail fund for prisoners'\nbenefit; court rejected request that separate stipulated fines for violations of\ndecree regarding prisoner recreation be paid directly to prisoners); Alberti v.\nKlevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1357 & 1359 (5th Cir. 1995) (fines imposed for\nfuture violations ofconsentdecree population cap); Palmigiano v. DiPrete,\n710 F. Supp. 875, 888-89 (D.R.I.), affd, 887 F.2d 258 (1st Cir. 1989)\n(imposing prospective fines ifjail officials failed to show compliance with\ncourt order by future date); Mobile County Jail Inmates v. Purvis, 551\nF. Supp. 92, 97-98 (S.D. Ala. 1982), affd, 703 F.2d 580 (11th Cir. 1983)\n(prospective daily fine imposed commencing on date ofcontempthearing,\nbutjail officials allowed to purge sanction by complying with court order);\nsee also Cartyv. Schneider, 986 F. Supp. at 939-40 (denying requested\nmonetary sanction for ongoing failure to comply with'prison consent\ndecree, noting the interest of the state and local authorities in managing\ntheir own affairs and that monetary sanctions would drastically affect the\npublic interest and would impede efforts to improve conditions of\nconfinement within the prison system).\nHere, under the decision ofthe Court ofAppeals, the Circuit Court\nwould have no discretion to consider whether a monetary sanction payable\ndirectly to the plaintiffclass ~ as opposed to any other sanction, monetary\n37\n\nor otherwise - would be appropriate and necessary under the circumstances\nunique to this case. Instead, the taxpayers of Milwaukee County would\nnecessarily bear the burden of funding a potentially drastic award of\ndamages to the plaintiffclass, inevitably to the detriment ofongoing efforts\nto fund and implement other improvements in the Jail and, more generally,\n. to the already overburdened county finances as a whole.\nIn'addition, in removing any discretion from the hands ofthe Circuit\nCourt, the mandate ofthe Court ofAppeals also looks past the multitude of\nprocedural problems that would make an award ofdamages directly to the\nplaintiff class all but unworkable. Due process considerations inherent to\nthe contempt procedure in Wisconsin demand that petitioners have notice\nand an opportunity for a hearing with respect to a remedial sanction\nimposed in favor of any single member of the plaintiff class in this case.\nSee Wis. Stat. §785.03(l). Moreover, class actions for injunctive reliefare\nprocedurally and substantively different than those for damages, and there\nhas been no effort to date by plaintiffs to satisfy their significant burden to\njustify the certification of a class for damages. See, e.g., Wis. Stat.\n§ 803.08; Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(l) & (2), & (c)(2)(A) (regarding classes\nfor injunctive relief); Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(3), & (c)(2)(B) (regarding\nclasses for damages).\nIn fact, considerations usually central to the question of whether a\nplaintiffclass can be certified for damages do not weigh in favor ofsuch a\nclass under the present circumstances. See, e.g., Pastor v. State Farm Mut.\nAuto Ins. Co., 487 F.3d 1042, 1047 (7th CiL 2007) (reasoning that \"when a\n38\n\nseparate (:;videntiary hearing is required for-each class member's claim, the\naggregate expense may, ifeach claim is very small, swamp the benefitsof\nclass-action treatment\"); Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Sys. Corp., 319 F.3d 910,\n911 (7th Cir. 2003) (class action treatment appropriate only \"when the\njudicial economy from consolidation of separate claims outweighs\nconcern with possible inaccuracies from their being lumped together in a\nsingle proceeding for decision by a singlejudge or jury\"); Andrews v. Am.\nTel. & Tel. Co., 95 F.3d 1014, 1023 (lIth Cir. 1996) (denying class\ncertification given existence of numerous individual issues with respect to\ndamages).\nBy looking past these issues, the decision of the Court of Appeals\nignores the very real possibility that any award of damages to individual\nprisoners for violations of the 30-Hour Rule would require individual\nhearings or assessments on the issue of damages for more than 16,000\nprisoners, a procedural morass that necessarily would weigh heavily in the\nCircuit Court's consideration ofwhether to award such damages.\nNonetheless, unless the Court ofAppeals' decision is overturned, the\ntaxpayers ofMilwaukee County will bear this burden despite the fact that\nthe class action complaint in this case sought injunctive rather than\ncompensatory relief. Likewise, the taxpayers will bear this burden\nnotwithstanding the factthat the Consent Decree itself- consistent with the\nrepresentations ofcounsel for the plaintiffclass - does not contemplate an\naward of damages in the event of a violation of its provisions. Indeed,\nsome twelve years after the initial pro se complaint was filed in this case,\n39\n\n·seven years after the Consent Decree was entered, and roughly five years\nafter the Decree was first eligible to be terminated, the Court of Appeals'\ndecision·requires the parties to now embark on lengthy and undoubtedly\ncostly litigation over money damages that were never before asked for or\nconte:mjJlated in this litigation and which, regardless of the outcome, will\nnot serve to better the Jail or its operation.\n\",*\".\nThis is precisely the type of litigation that. Congress sought to\neliminate on the federal level in enactingthe federal PLRA. As one federal\njudge has noted,\nThe thrust of the criticism which prompted the\nlegislation was that the federal courts had overstepped\ntheir authority and were mollycoddling the prisoners in\nstate and local jails. In short, the time had come to let\nthe responsible entities, the municipal and state\nlegislatures, take careoftheirown correctional facilities.\nAfter all, the cost of keeping up with the decrees are\nstate and municipal obligations to be borne by state and\nmunicipal taxpayers, why shouldn't they be dictated by\nstate and municipal legislative bodies responsible to\ntheir constituents.\nBenjamin v. Jacobson, 935 F. Supp. 332, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), affd in part\n& rev'd in part on other grounds, 172 F.3d 144 (2nd Cir. 1999).\nFor all of the reasons described herein, this Court likewise should\nresist the temptation to prolong the ,involvement of the Circuit Court in\ncostly, resource consuming litigation that focuses solely on a problem that\nthe County fixed, on its own, more than four years ago and perpetuates a\njudicial decree that, by its own terms, may otherwise be ripe for\ntermination.\n40\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, petitioners respectfully submit that the\nDecision ofthe Court ofAppeals should be reversed.\nDated this II day ofJune, 2008.\nth\nIlliam J.

SULLIVAN (Secretary, Wisconsin\nDept. ofCorrections), LEV BALDWIN (Milwaukee\nCounty Sheriff) and MILWAUKEE COUNTY\n(a political body corporate),\nDefendants.\n.SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nThe plaintiffclass, consisting ofall persons who are now or in the future\nwill be confIned in the Milwaukee County Criniinal Justice Facility (jail -or \nMCJ), and the County defendants, Lev Baldwin, SheriffofMilwaukee County\nand MilwaUkee County, agree that the following consent decree shall be\nsubmitted for approval by the Court to resolve the issues being litigated in Case\nas\nNo. 96CV001835. The parties herein agree to the provisions contained\nfollows: .\nPart I. Population Limits\n1. Population Agreement.\nA. This agreement is entered into to resolve existing disputes between\nthe parties concerning conditions ofconfInement atthejail. .\nNothing in this consent decree shall be used as evidence ofa\nconstitutional violation in any other matter.\n1\nApp.35\n\n\"\nB. This Court has held that it has jurisdiction of this action.\nPlaintiffs' causes ofaction arise under Article I, sec. 1(due process\nand equal protection) and Article I, sec. 6 (cruel and inhuman\npunishment) of the Wisconsin State constitution.\nC. The case was certified as a class action in August, 1996. The.\nplaintiffclass consists ofall persons who are now or in the future\nwill be confined in the Milwaukee County Criminal Justice Facility\n(jail). The Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, Inc. and the ACLU of\nWisconsin are counsel for the plaintiffclass.\nD. Defendants are the individuals named in the complaint and their\nsuccessors, including Lev Baldwin, the Milwaukee (;ounty Sheriff,\nMilwaukee County (a political body corporate) and Jon Litscher,\nthe SecretaryofWisconsin's Department ofCorrections. The\nSheriffand Milwaukee County are referred to herein as County\ndefendants. This agreement is between the County defendants and\nthe plaintiffclass.\nE. Plaintiffs have alleged that they have been deprived of the\nconstitutionally required basic necessities oflife including access\nto care for serious medical and mental health needs, that crowded\nliving conditions in thejail have caused risk orserious harm, and\nthat as a result ofsuch conditions, plaintiffclass has been\npunished withoutjustification.\nF. Countydefendants denythat they failed to meet constitutional\nrequirements toward any plaintiffherein, but nevertheless agree to\nprevent the occurrence ofconstitutional violations in the future.\nThis agreement does not constitute an adjudication, finding or\nadmission ofany present or past unlawful practice by ddendants,\nit being fully understood that defendants deny unlawful acts or\npractices exist or have occurred. The parties have entered into this\nagreement as a means ofending these controversies and of\navoiding the costs and risks ofcontinued litigation.\nG. Plaintiffs have brought summaryjudgment motions in connection\nwith their allegations and County defendants have responded in\n.opposition to plaintiffs' summaryjudgment motions. The parties\nagree and the court consents to withhold any decision upon such\nsummaryjudgment motions and hold the action in abeyance\npending the successful conclusion of this agreement.\n2\nApp.36\n\n.-\nH. County defendants agree to operate the jail in a manner consistent\nwith the terms of this agreement which the parties agree meets\nconstitutional requirements. The parties have entered into this\nconsent decree in order to resolve these controversies, and to avoid\nthe costs, time and risks which litigation would involve for all\nparties. Execution and implementation of this consent decree is\nnot dependent upon any fIling or resolution of plaintiffs' petition for\nattorneys' fees and costs.\n1. For purposes of this lawsuit only, and in order to settle this matter,\nthe parties-mutually agree that the prospective reliefin this decree\nis designed to meet the nature and substance ofthe harm that\nplaintiffs have allegedin this action they suffered, but which\ndefendants have denied. Further, the terms of the consent decree\nhave been narrowly drawn to remove the court from the decision\nmaking process ofMilwaukee County and the Milwaukee County\nSheriff. The County Board will approve costs associated with\ncompliance. No master will be appointed to oversee compliance\nwith population limits agreed to herein. The consent decree will\nnot place this court in the position ofan architect, a gatekeeper, an\naccountant or an appropriating body for the jail. Instead, the\nproposed decree limits the court's role in enforcing its terms. In\nthese ways, then, the reliefset forth herein is fashioned to meet, in\nthe least intrUsive manner necessary, the nature and substance of\nviolations plaintiffs' have alleged!. County defendants will not\nchallenge the validity of this consent decree at any stage of the\nproceedings (e.g., the approval, party monitoring, compliance\nenforcement, contempt and appeal stages), and will oppose the\nefforts ofother persons who may challenge its validity. County\ndefendants retain and reserve to themselves the right to dispute\nthe circumstancesalleged by plaintiffs as giving rise to the need for\ncompliance enforcement, contempt and appeal proceedings, but\nonly to the extent that such disputations do not challenge the\nunderlying validity ofthis agreement. Ifa court at any stage ofthe\nproceedings should determine that this consent decree is not valid,\nthen and in that event, this court may proceed to decide the\nsummaryjudgment motion pending in this action, according to\nparagraph 1.G., supra. These parties further agree that the terms of\nthe judgment will not have an adverse impact on public safety or\nthe operation ofthe criminal justice system.\nII. CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT: POPULATION AND OVERCROWDING\n, Insofaras and to the extent agreed to by the parties\n3\nApp.37\n\n.'\n_- •• \"'To\nA. As of , 2000, and thereafter, County defendants and their\nemployees, agents and'successors are ordered to maintain the jail\npopulation at or below 1100 (within the exceptions and procedures\nset forth below). The calculation and monitoring of this cap shall\nbe the correct figure ofall persons in custody in the jail at 11:59\np.m. daily and as posted as Average Daily Population (ADP) on the\nso-called \"Daily Census'Reports\" also sometimes called the\n\"11:59\" jail report form\nB. County defendants agree to maintain the population levels in and\nat the jail in accordance with the resolution ofthe Milwaukee\nCounty Board signed by the Milwaukee County Executive attached\nhereto and incorporated byreference as exhibit \"A.\" County\ndefendants will use their best efforts to consider other alternatives\nfor reducing the population, including an impact study and\nutilization review to streamline pre-booking and release\nprocedures, more efficient triage practices and procedures,\ndiversion of persons with mental illness and the development of\nother pre-booking alternatives, before constructing additional jail,\nspace. County defendants agree to provide sufficient resources to\naccommodate inmates whose conditions ofconfinement will be\nmodified to such alternatives as electronic bracelets, the in-house\ndetention program, the day reporting center; and in the event they\ndo not, the court may order County defendants to comply with the\nterms of the consent decree. '\nC. As of , and thereafter, no jail inmate shall be required to\nsleep on a mattress on the jail floor or on the jail floor: There shall\nbe no inmate in thejail for longer than 30 hours without being\nassigned to a bed approved by regulationsof the Wisconsin\nDepa..'i:ment ofCorrections for overnight housing (see '1fD, next\nfollowing).\nD. Best efforts shall be made to assure that there will be no more\nthan 110 inmates in booking at the midnight count. If the number\nexceeds 110, there shall be a plan for adequate emergency staffing\nin the booking room. The plan shall limit the number ofinmates\nin the locked rooms surrounding the open waiting area in the\nbooking room and shall specify how often those side rooms are\nchecked. The maximum permanent population limit for the jail\nshall be 1100 at the midnight, \"11:59,\" count (according to the so \ncaned \"Daily Census Reports\"). The 1100 permanent capacitY limit\non the jail assumes that there will be a reasonable number of .\n4\nApp.38\n\n..\n'\npersons held on a short-term basis in the booking area. Since\nthere are no beds in the booking room, a number ofinmates may\nbe placed there for not more than thirty hours. County defendants\nwill exercise best efforts to limit any inmate's stay in booking \nopen waiting to twenty-four hours.\nE. Classification screening shall be done in accordance with time\nlimits now in place. Ifclassifications are modified to improve the\ntimeliness ofclassification, the new guidelines may be\nimplemented.\nF. Staffmg; Throughout the life of this consent decree, County\ndefendants shall maintain or enhance the present staffmg levels at\nthe jail and shall ;issure adequate training and supervision.\nNothing in this agreement shall, however, restrict Milwaukee\nCounty from implementing cost-effective alternatives to staffing as\nit presently exists, like contracting for outside services, such as for\nexample, what was done regarding medical records.\nIII. ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\nA. The Court shall retainjurisdiction for purposes ofenforcing this\nconsent decree until it determines that there is substantial\ncompliance. Nothing stated herein shall prevent plaintiffs from\nmoving the Court for enforcement or contempt upon a claim of\nnon-compliance.\nB. The injunctive provisions of this de.cree shall take effect\nimmediately upon the preliminary approval date and shall remain\nin effect until the court determines that there is substantial\ncompliance with the terms, provisions and purposes of the decree\nand that there is no longer a need forthe court's involvement to\nprevent future overcrowding. Substantial compliance shall be\nmeasured by the following factors: 1) having maintained the jail at\nor below capacity without the need for courtintervention for two\nyears; and 2) the number ofdays thejail wasnm at the maximum\nlimit; and 3) increased use ofother temporaryjail facilities to\nhouse inmates. These factors are to be considered in a manner\nthat primary consideration is given to factor #1 (maintaining the\njail at or below capacity); factors #2 (number ofdays at mma.mum)\nand #3 (use ofother facilities) would be carry additional weight\ntoward the end of the two year period as a means ofgauging\nwhether County defendants have achieved substantial compliance.\nIn that connection, seasonal peaks and cyclical pressures may be\n5\nApp.39\n\n·-- .\nconsidered in determining whether substantial compliance has\nbeen achieved. After two years next following the commencement of\nthis agreement, either party may apply to the Court for an order\ndismissing the overcrowding provisions of this case. Plaintiffs\nretain the right to oppose the application if they contend County\ndefendants have failed to comply with any population limits\nprovision of this decree. .\nC. The court shall resolve disputes between the parties regarclii:J.g the\napplication and implementation of the consent decree. The court\nshall hear emergency requests for short-term modifications ofthe\npopulation limits incorporated in this consent decree. Ifnecessary,\nthe court shall order the Sheriffto comply with the terms ofthis\nagreement.\nD.. Nothing in Sec. II paragraphs, A and B of the consent decree shall\nprohibit the County defendants, by counsel, from petitioning the\ncourt for a short term emergency modification to these agreed\nupon population limits, provided plaintiffs' counsel has immediate\nnotification ofsuch petition, and provided piaintiffs' counsel\nreceives a written statement ofthe grounds for such petition within\n24 hours and further provided that plaintiffs' counsel has the\nopportunity to be heard within a reasonable time not to exceed 48\nhours. County defendants at all times carry the burden ofproof\nand persuasion on the necessity for emergency relief.\nE. If there are petitions pursuant to Sec. III D or other petitions\nraising issues, they shall be in writing, with contemporaneous\nnotice to counsel for the opposing party.\nF. On each Monday during the life of the consent decree, the Sheriff\nshall mail to the Legal Aid Society ofMilwaukee, Inc., the so-called\n\"Daily Census Reports\" (in the form ofthe copy attached hereto as\nExhibit \"B\") as well as the Milwaukee CountyJail Population and\nMilwaukee County Inmate Population pie charts (in the form ofthe\ncopy attached hereto as Exhibits \"C-l and C-2\") from the prior\nweek.\nG. For the life of this consent decree, counsel for plaintiffs may\nconduct inspections upon request at reasonable times and upon\nreasonable notice to defendants' counsel. Counsel for plaintiffs\nshall review population documents supplied by defendants and\nprepare semi-annual reports for the court indicating the status of\n6\nApp.40\n\nCounty defendants' compliance with the provisions of this consent\ndecree.\nH. Until the Court relinquishes jurisdiction in this case, the Legal Aid\nSociety ofMilwaukee, Inc., as plaintiffs' counsel's designee, shall\nhave access to all plaintiffs at reasonable times and under\n.reasonable circumstances. Plaintiffs' counsel and their experts\nshall have reasonable access at reasonable times to all staffand\nthe jail, upon reasonable notice to defendants' counsel.\n1. Notice to the plaintiffclass shall be provided in accordance with\nthe notice provisions approved by the Court and separately\nsubmitted by the parties. In order to ensure continuing notice of\nthis consent decree, new inmates shall be notified ofthe terms of\nthis decree and of the identity ofcounsel for plaintiffs throughout\nthe life ofthe consent decree by defendants' posting of a written\nsummary of the consent decree in booking, the infirmary, special\nneeds, security pods, and in every pod.\nJ. Plaintiffs'claims regarding overcrowding, medical and mental\nhealth conditions are dismissed with prejudice when the consent\ndecree expires.\nK. The parties agree that nothing in this consent decree is intended to\nprevent County defendants from implementing new programs or\nchanges in physical conditioris which do not decrease the plaintiffs'\nrights under this consent decree or which existed prior to this\nconsent decree pursuant to valid policies, procedures; nor shall it\nabrogate any substantive rights or procedural protections plaintiffs\nmaynow have or thereafter acquire under state or federal statutes.\nCounty defendants shall carry out every provision of this consent\ndecree in good faith.\nPart II..Health Services\nDefinition - Health Services for Milwaukee County's\ndetention/correctional system provides medical, mental health and dental\ntreatment for inmates incarcerated in the Milwaukee CountyJail (MCJ) and\nMilwaukee County House ofCorrection (HOC).\n7\nApp.41\n\nI.

A review of the issue ofelectronicsurveillance vs. community access with the\n140 recognition that mostjudges do not believe that electronic surveillance is\n141 adequate punishment in many cases whereas community access provides\n142 some sense of punishment by confinement rather than a situation where\n143 someone is at home by the phone.\n144\n145 3. An expanded review ofelectronic surveillance to examine the corresponding\n146 numbers and categories ofoffenses for those on electronic surveillance.\n147\n148 4. A comprehensive review ofcategories ofoffenses and corresponding bails\n149 rather than a sole focus on bail evaluation.\n150\n151 5. Change the wording \"sentence modification\" to \"sentence interruption\"with\n152 the recognition that sentence interruption is more acceptable than the\n153 perception ofsentence forgiveness.\n154\n155 ; and\n156\n157 WHEREAS, on June 29, 2000, the Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee\n158 agreed by consensus to recommend adoption of the cap proposal presented by\n159 the Sheriffand Superintendent, House ofCorrection, with the recommended\n-160 enhancements in fines 139-157 ofthis resolution to be included in the cap -\n161 proposal to-accurately reflect the sentiments ofthe Criminal Justice Coordinating\n162 Committee; and\n163\n164 WHEREAS, an effective way to begin toaddress the issue of providing\n_165 additional capacity for individuals sentenced to community access would be to\n166 undertake a comprehensive review ofall-community accessresources that exist\n167 within Milwaukee County; and\n168 WHEREAS, the Milwaukee County Board ofSupervisors, at its meeting of\n169 July 20, 2000, referred the Judiciary Committee's recommendation back (Vote\n170 17-7); now, therefore\n171\n4\nApp.61\n\n(\n172 BE IT RESOLVED, that the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors does\n173 hereby adopt the plan presented by the Sheriffand Superintendent, House of\n174 Correction, as modified by the Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee, to cap\n175 the population of the entire Milwaukee County Jail and House ofCorrection\n176 system; and\n177\nl7& BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Executive is hereby urged to\n179 consider for inclusion in his 2001 Recommended Budget the necessary funding to\n180 allow the Superintendent, House of Correction, to undertake a comprehensive\n181 review ofall community access resources that exist within Milwaukee County;\n182 and\n183\n184 BE ITFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Superintendentof the House of\n185 Correction shall presenta written report to the Judiciary, Safety and General\n186 Services Committee at its next meeting listing the categories ofcrimes\n187 committed by people who could be released ifthis resolution were approved\n188 induding the approximately 1,000 persons in custody who have been sentenced\n189 . to community access; and\n190\n191 BE ITFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Countyconsider creating a position\n192 for a community access coordinator to look at social services for community\n193 sentE;ncing programs.\n194\n195 FISCAL NOTE: Adoption ofthis resolution would authorize a cap on the\n196 population of the County Jail which is tiedto a cap for the\n197 system wide population which includes the CountyJail and\n198 House ofCorrection. At lower population levels, there would be\n199 a series ofpopulation control actions to be undertaken in Levels\n200 I and II by the Sheriffand Superintendent, House ofCorrection\n201 for those who qualify for community access. Examples include\n202 increased bail reviews and re-evaluations, expanded electronic\n203 surveillance, and the In-House home detention program..\n204\n205 No additional cost is projected for an expanded bail review and\n206 re-evaluation effort by the Sheriff's Department or House of\n. 207. Correction. An expanded.electronicsurveillance effort is\n208 projected to cost $2.50/day per person. Existing staffhas the\n209 capacity to monitor and phone an additional 100 people over\n210 the 200 presently on electronic surveillance. Monitoring over\n211 this level would require an additional Correctional Officer 1\n212 position for each 100 inmate increment. Based On current\n213 monitoring capacity, the cost for an expanded electronic\n214 surveillance effort is approXimately $250/day or $7,500/month.\n215 This is compared to housing 100 additional inmates at the\nApp.62\n5\n\n216 County Jail at a rate of $18.15/day per person, $l,815/day for\n217 100 additional inmates/ or $54/500/month; or/ at the House of\n218 Correction at a rate of$13.57/day per person, $1/357/day for\n219 100 additional inmates/ or $41/000/month. It is apparent from\n220 these figures that under a scenario in which up to 100\n221 additional inmates are placed on electronic surveillance/ there is\n222 a considerable cost avoidance ofapproximately $33/500 - .\n223 $47/000/month versus incarcerating individuals who would\n224. otherwise qualify for community access.\n225\n226 In-House Correctional SerVices detention program is budgeted\n227 to serve an average of 191 adult defendant slots per day at\n228 $12.50/day perslot This program is more intensive than\n229 electronicsurveillance in that personal house calls are madeto\n230 check up on an iridividual who/ for example/ does not have a\n231 phone. The program has been averaging approximately 140\n232 placements so there is room to slot more individuals. Should\n233 the program exceed 191 slots dueto either court referrals or\n234 House ofCorrection referrals/ a request to increase the\n235 appropriation for the program would need to be made.\n236\n237 Despite the ongoing actionsatLevelsI and II/greatercosts··\n238 would be incurred ifitisnot possible to maintain the\n239 corresponding population levelswith the menu ofexpandedand\n240 intensive monitoring:actions already mentioned. Beginning-at\n241 Level III when the population ofthe CountyJail exceeds the\n242 proposed cap of 1/075 anda system wide population level of\n243 approximately 3/400/ it is estimated that utilization of5 East to\n244 house excess prisoners would cost approXimately$5/700 per\n245 . day or $169/500 per'month. Additional emergency measures\n246 that could potentially be utilized to alleviate severe\n247 overcrowding include use ofthe CityJail at $4/800 per dpy or\n248 $137/500 per month/ and/or the Wolke Gym at $2/100 per day\n249 or $61/000 per month.\n250\n251 Itshould be noted that 300 additional bed spaces would\n252. become available at the House ofCorrection once the new state\n253 probation and parole facility opens in mid-20Ot and 300 state\n254 VOPs are transferred to the new facility.

Does a Wisconsin court have the authority to award compensatory\ndamages as a remedial sanction for contempt of court where\ndefendantshave committedmorethan 16,000intentionalviolations of\na court order over a period oftwo and a halfyears?\nThe Court ofAppeals answered \"Yes.\"\n2. Does a Wisconsin court have the authority to award damages for\nbreach of contract where, contrary to the express provisions of a\nsettlement agreement and consent decree, thousands of Milwaukee\nCounty Jail inmates were held for more than 30 hours in the jail's\nbooking area without beds and in squalid, unsafe, and degrading\nconditions?\nThe Court ofAppeals did not answer this question, deeming it\nunnecessary to resolution ofthe appeal.\nSTATEMENT ON ORAL ARGUMENT AND PUBLICATION\nPlaintiffs-Appellants (\"plaintiffs\" or \"the plaintiffclass\") agree with\nthe statement on oral argument and publication submitted by Defendants \nRespondents-Petitioners (\"defendants\" or \"the County\").\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nPlaintiffs filed this action on July 25, 1996, seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relieffrom overcrowding and other conditions at the Milwaukee\nCountyCriminalJustice Facilitythatviolated the Constitution ofthe State of\nWisconsin. (RI2). On June 19, 2001, the Circuit Court, the Honorable\nThomas Donegan presiding, approved a settlement and consent decree\nI\n\n(\"decree\") between the countydefendants (the SheriffofMilwaukee County\nand Milwaukee County) and the plaintiffclass. (RI61, App. 35-84).1 The\ndecree defined the class as \"allpersons who are now or in the future will be\nconfinedin the Milwaukee County CriminalJustice Facility Gail-or-MCJ).\"\n(RI61, App. 35; R154).\nOn September 13, 2004, plaintiffs filed a Motion To Enforce\nSettlementAgreement and Consent Decree, seeking both contempt-of-court\nand breach-of-contract remedies based on, in relevant part, defendants'\nadmission ofhaving held over 13,000 inmates in the jail's booking room in\nexcess of 30 hours in violation of the decree. (R240, 241, 242). On\nNovember 15, 2004, the Circuit Court, the Honorable Jeffrey Kremers\npresiding, found that the defendants had violated the consent decree and\nallowed further discovery as to plaintiffs' entitlement to contempt and/or\ncontractremedies. (R306:14-18). OnJanuary6, 2006- following discovery,\nsubmission of affidavits and other evidence, briefing, and argument - the\nCircuit Court, the Honorable Clare L. Fiorenza presiding, found the\ndefendants in contempt ofcourt and in breach oftheir agreement for 16,662\nviolations of the decree, but held that the victims of the defendants'\nmisconductcouldnotrecoverdamagesto compensate them for theharm they\nsuffered. (R282, App. 21-34).\nOn April 3, 2006, the plaintiffs appealed. (R299). On January 29,\n2008, the Court ofAppeals issued a published decision reversing the Circuit\nCourtandremanding the case for furtherproceedings. (App. 1-20),2008 WI\nApp 18, _ Wis. 2d _,746 N.W.2d 553. Relying in part on this Court's\nI\"R\"refers totherecordinthis case. \"App.\" refers tothe AppendixtoBriefof\nPetitioners. \"CountyBr.\"refersto theBriefofDefendants-Respondents-Petitioners.\n2\n\nrecent decision in Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, 304 Wis. 2d 1, 736\nN.W.2d 85, the Court ofAppeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Kessler\nand joined by Judge Wedemeyer, held that \"the remedy ofsanctions under\nWis. Stat. § 785.04 for continuing contempt, as described in Frisch, is\napplicable to the contempt found by the trial court here.\" (App.4). Judge\nFine issued a concurring opinion; he agreed with the majority's result and\nmost ofits opinionbutstated that, in his view,Frisch \"changednothing\" and\nthat, \"[u]nder Wis. Stat. § 785.04(l)(a)'s forthright and unambiguous\ndirective, the plaintiffs are entitled to be compensated for the losses and\ninjuries they suffered as a result ofMilwaukee [County]'s clear and blatant\ncontempt.\" (App. 20). The Court ofAppeals remanded the case to the trial\ncourt for determination of the amount of the sanction and for such further\nproceedings as may be appropriate. (App. 19, ~ 24).2\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nThe consent decree approved by the Circuit Court on June 19, 2001,\nprovides in pertinent part:\nC. As of 3121/01, and thereafter, no jail inmate shall be\nrequired to sleep on amattress on thejail floor or on the\njailfloor. There shallbe no inmate in thejail for longer\nthan thirty hours without being assigned to a bed\napproved by regulations ofthe Wisconsin Department\nof Corrections for overnight housing. (See Paragraph\nD, next following).\nD. . .. Since there are no beds in the booking room, a\nnumber of inmates may be placed there for not more\nthan thirty hours. Countydefendants will exercise best\n'The CourtofAppeals didnotdiscuss thebreach-of-contractclaimsbecauseitfound\nthemunnecessarytoresolutionofthe appeal. (App. 19'\\I24).\n3\n\nefforts to limit any inmate's stay III booking-open\nwaiting to twenty-four hours.\n(RI54:4 § II, ~~ C and D, App. 38).\nBasedontherecordinthis case,thetrialcourtfoundthatthedefendants\ncommitted 16,662 intentional violations of the 30-hour provision of the\nconsent decree. (R282:5, App. 25). In findings of fact that were based in\nsubstantial part on admissions by the defendants' and were accepted and\nquoted at length by the Court of Appeals (see App. 7-8 '\\f 5): the trialcourt\nfound that the sheer number of these violations was \"staggering\" (R282:5,\nApp. 25); thattheviolationsspannedtwo and ahalfyears, from approximately\nNovember2001(onlymonths afterthe consentdecreewas approvedbyJudge\nDonegan) untilMay2004 (shortly afterplaintiffs broughtthe violations to the\ncourt's attention) (id.); that county officials had the capability to track how\nlong inmates were being held in booking-open waiting, and that they in fact\ndid so bymaintaining a list of inmates held longer than 72 hours (id. at 5-6,\nApp. 25-26); and that countyofficials were specifically put on notice ofnon \ncompliance with the consent decree in December 2002 and January 2003,\nwhen deputies' complaints of overcrowding, understaffing, and unsafe\nconditions in the booking area brought the Sheriff and Principal Assistant\nCorporationCounselbeforetheCountyBoardCommitteeonJudiciary,Safety,\n'See. e.g., (R242, Ex. 3)(48-houraverage stayinbooking); (R257:84-88) (n-hour\nshowerlists); (R258:3,5) (violationsummariesfrom countydata); (R255:4-7), (R257:47,\n54, 56, 69,73,76-78) Gailstaffdepositions onholdingcellconditions); (R255:17-26,\nR277:8-12, R257:14:16, 21-23, 26-28, 31-35, 39-44)(commandstaffknowledge of\nviolations); (R255:20c21, R258:1, 6-13) (countyboardcommittee hearings onbooking\nareaconditions).\nThe SupremeCourtordinarilydoes notreexamine acourtofappeals' determinationthat\n4\nacircuitcourt'sfindings offact were basedonsufficientevidence. See Curriev.\nSchwalbach. 139Wis. 2d544, 552,407N.W.2d862(1987).\n4\n\nand General Services (id. at 6-7, App. 26-27).\nThe trial courtalso found thatplaintiffs had documented conditions in\nthe booking-open waiting area that were \"unacceptable, if not appalling,\"\nincluding\"overlycrowdedconditions,inmateswhowere forced to sitorsleep\non the floornexttourinals, inmates who hadto situp forhours andhours, lack\nof hygiene, unsanitary conditions, inmates who were not given pillows or\nblankets to sleep on, cells that were infested with bugs, cold temperatures,\nbodily fluids on the floor and bad odors.\" (R282:7, App. 27).' The Court of\nAppeals accepted these findings as well. (App. 7-8 ~ 5). As the trial court\nfurther found, and as the Court ofAppeals confirmed, these conditions \"were\nnot directly contradicted bythe Affidavits submitted by Milwaukee County.\"\n(R282:7, App. 27); (App. 7 ~ 5). The trial court further found that, between\nNovember 2001 andApri12004, 4,811 inmates were held inthis environment\ninbooking for more than two days, and 719 inmates were held there for more\nthan three days - some in excess of 100 hours. (R282:7, App. 27).\nNow, however, the County belatedly urges this Court to overturn or\ndisregard these factual findings. Referring in its briefto what it describes as\nthe \"amenities\"ofthebookingarea(CountyBr. 11),the Countypaintsalovely\npicture ofconditions there; this idealizedpicture, however, is entirelyat odds\nwith the facts established in the record, found by the Circuit Court, and\naffirmed by the Court ofAppeals.\nThe Countyargues in this Courtthat\"pressures andlimitations that are\n'Seealso (R256) (describing, interalia, sleepdeprivation; lackofaccess to toilets,\nshowersandcleanclothes; fear ofviolence).

However, the trial courtfound to the contrary, noting that it\nwas \"quite telling\" that the 30-hour violations ceased immediately after\nplaintiffs filed their motion seeking discovery. (R282:10, App. 30). \"The\nspeed at which Milwaukee County was able to remedy the problem and\nimprove the conditions in the booking area demonstrates that hadthe County\nmade aseriouseffortto complywiththe thirty-hourrequirement, itcouldhave\nprevented the violations.\" Id. These findings are fully supported by the\nrecord. Morethanhalftheviolations (8,405) occurredajterplaintiffs' counsel\nbegan seeking information from defendants in the spring of 2003 regarding\ncompliance with the 30-hour rule. See (R242:1-3; R257:2-3, 369-387;\nR258:3). Counsel made several requests for this information between April\n2003 andApril2004,butdefendants deniedthatanysignificantviolations had\noccurredandrefusedtoprovideanydocumentation. (R257:3, 370). Itwasnot\nuntil April 2004 that, in response to plaintiffs' motion for permission to\nconduct discovery, defendants finally admitted in court that they had\ncommitted thousands of violations over the previous two and a half years.\n(R242:1-5; R257:2-3.)'\n'Contraryto the County'ssuggestion(CountyBr. 9n.5), therecordshowsthatplaintiffs'\ncounsel maderepeatedefforts to obtain informationpertainingto defendants'\ncompliancewiththe decree, includingthe 30-hourrule, butwere deniedthe information\nnecessarytopreparemeaningful compliancereports. Therecordshowsthat6,140\nviolations occurredafterdefendants' emphaticdenial onSeptember4, 2003, thatany\nimnateswere forced to sleeponthe floor (R257:3; R258:3); that3,474violations\noccurredafterNovember2003, whenplaintiffs' counselalerteddefendants to an\nanonymous tip that inmates were beingtemporarilymovedtoavoidreportinghigh\nnumbers inbookingandthat inmates were beingheldwithoutbeds formultiple days\n(R258:3; R302:23-24; R242:1-2);andthat3,226violations occurred afterDecember\n2003, whenplaintiffs' counseltouredthejail, questionedthe deputyinspectorincharge,\nandsubmittedaletterto defendants' counselrequesting specificdataon lengthofstay in\nbooking andaccess tobookingroomlogbooks (R242:3, R232:7-1O; R258:3). The\nviolations stoppedalmostimmediatelyafterdefendants' April2004 in-courtadmission.\n6\n\nContrary to the County's assertion (County Br. 17-18), there is ample\nevidence in the record that the jail's \"command staff' had knowledge ofthe\nmagnitudeofthe30-hourviolations. As the CircuitCourtfound andtheCourt\nofAppeals affirmed:\nMilwaukeeCountyofficials hadthe capabilityto trackhow long\ninniates were being held in the bbbking/()pen waiting area....\nInmates who were held in booking for longer than seventy-two\n(72) hours were given showers and new clothes.... [T]he\nexistenceofthe showerlistalso demonstrates ...thattheCounty\nactually knew that the Consent Decree was being violated.\nMilwaukee County was put on notice of problems in the\nbooking area in December of2002 and January of 2003 when\ntheCountyBoardJudiciaryCommitteewas forced torespondto\ncomplaints from Sheriffs Deputies that overcrowding in the\nbooking area was creating unsafe working conditions ....\n(R282:5-6, App. 25-26; App. 7'11 5).\nIt was, indeed, \"beyond [the trial] Court's comprehension how over 16,000\nviolations ofthe Consent Decree could go undetected.\" Id.\nAs in the courts below, the County also argues in this Court that its\ncompliance with other provisions of the consent decree should excuse its\nmassive failure to comply with the 30-hour mle. (See, e.g., County Br. 13 \n19).' This contention was flatly rejected by the trial court, which found as\nSee(R257:6-10). Seealso (R235) (plaintiffs' stams report andexhibits).\n'TheCountyattempts tohidebehindthe supposed complexityof\"myriadprovisions\nrelatingtopopulationcontrolmeasures andthe medical, dental, andpsychiatric careof\ninmates inthe Jail.\" (CountyBr. 7). However, thepopulationlimits inpartIofthe\ndecree, for which defendants are directlyresponsible, are short, simple anddirect. The·\nCountymustnotexceedtheoveralljailpopulationlimitandthe limitonnumbers in\nbooking, and itmust, underno circumstances,house inmates inthebookingroom, which\nhas no beds,past30hours. (R154:6-7, App. 38-39). The health servicesprovisions of\nthe decree are distinct fromthepopulationslimits andareunderthe supervisionofan\nappointedexpertmonitor. (RI54: 9-19, App. 41-51).\n7\n\nfollows: \"When 16,662 inmates are forced to spend days in a crowded\nbooking area in the condition described bythe affiants, this Courtcannotfind\nthat Milwaukee County has substantially complied with the terms or the\npurpose ofthe Consent Decree. The sheer number and seriousness of those\nviolations cannotbeoverlookedsimplybecause Milwaukee Countycomplied\nwith some ofthe provisions.\" (R282:l0, App. 30).\nBased upon the totality ofthe circumstances, the Circuit Court found,\nand the Court ofAppeals affirmed, that defendants' actions were intentional\nand constituted contempt ofcourt. (Id. at 8, App. 28; App. 7-8, 'II 5-6). The\ntrial court also found that defendants did not substantially comply with the\ndecree ,and that, on the contrary, they breached its 30-hour provision.\n(R282:11, App. 31). The trial court concluded, however, that plaintiffs were\nentitled to neither remedial sanctions for defendants' contempt (R282:8-9,\nApp. 28-29)nordamagesfordefendants'breachofcontract(id. at 11-14,App.\n31-34). As discussed below, the Court ofAppeals reversed the trial court's\nlegal conclusion that it did not have the authority to award compensatory\ndamages as a remedy for defendants' contempt. The CourtofAppeals found\nit unnecessary to reach the breach-of-contract issue.\nSTANDARDS OF REVIEW\nTheinterpretationoftheWisconsincontempt-of-courtstatutes,ch.785,\nand the existence and extent of the courts' inherent authority to provide a\nremedy for contempt, present questions of law which this Court reviews de\nnovo. Statev. Vanmanivong, 2003 WI 4,1 'il17, 261 Wis. 2d202,661 N.W.2d\n76. Whether the trial court had the authority to apply remedial contempt\nsanctions under the facts found requires interpretation and application of a\nstatute, which is also a question of law subject to de novo review. Frisch v.\n8\n\nHenrichs, 2007 WI 102, ~ 29,304 Wis. 2d 1,736 N.W.2d 85.\nThe trial court's findings offact, on the otherhand, generallymay not\nbe set aside unless they are clearlyerroneous. Wis. Stat. § 805.17(2). Where\nfindings of fact are based on inferences drawn solely from documentary\nevidence such as a contract or other written instrument, an appellate court\nreviews suchfindings de novo; eventhen, however, appellate courts value the\ntrial court's factual determinations. See Cohn v. Town ofRandall, 2001 WI\nApp 176, ~ 7,247 Wis. 2d 118,633 N.W.2d 674. The Supreme Court\nordinarilywillnotreexamine adetermination bythe CourtofAppeals thatthe\ntrial court's findings of fact were based on sufficient evidence. Currie v.\nSchwalbach, 139 Wis. 2d 544, 552, 407 N.W.2d 862 (1987).\nThe interpretation ofa contract or other written instrument normally\npresents a question of law that is reviewed de novo by the appellate courts.\nColumbia Propane, L.P., v. Wisconsin Gas Co., 2003 WI 38, ~ 12,261 Wis.\n2d 70, 661 N.W.2d 776. Where ambiguity in a contract requires resort to\nextrinsic evidence, the trial court's findings of fact generally will not be\ndisturbed on appeal unless they are against the great weight and clear\npreponderance ofthe evidence. Lambert v. Wrensch, 135 Wis. 2d 105, 115\nn.8, 399 N.W.2d 369 (1987). However, where the evidence is documentary\nand the findings are \"not dependent upon the fact finder's appraisal of the\ndemeanor of witnesses or the credibility that may be ascribed to their\ntestimony,\" the appellate courtneednotdeferto the trialcourt's interpretation·\nofthe terms ofa contract.'

CHAPTER 785 OF THE WISCONSIN STATUTES DOES NOT\nDEPRIVE THE COURTS OF THEIR POWER To COMPENSATE\nVICTIMS OFCONTEMPT BUT, ONTHE CONTRARY, CONFIRMS\nTHAT POWER.\n1. Priorto theEnactmentofChapter785,theWisconsin\nContempt Statutes Provided for Award of\nCompensatory Damages.\nInNovo, decided in 1966,the SupremeCourtaffirmed acompensatory\ndamages award under Wis. Stat. § 295.14, the immediate predecessor to Ch.\n785, noting that \"this court has previously upheld judgments of contempt\nrequiring the paymentofdamages under sec. 295.14, or its predecessor.\" 30\nWis. 2d at 130. Following the adoption of Ch. 785, but applying former §\n295.14, the Court again recognized compensatory damages as an appropriate\nstatutorysanction for contempt. Mohr v. City ofMilwaukee. 106 Wis. 2d 80,\n315 N.W.2d 504 (1982). In Mohr, a service station was in foreclosure, and\nthe cityhadbeenordered not to take anyaction thatmightchange the value of\nthepropertybefore itwas auctioned. The cityviolatedthis orderbyrazing the\nimprovements on the property before the sale, and the trial court awarded\ncompensatory damages to the mortgagors and the mortgagees for losses they\nsustained as a result of the city's contempt. The Supreme Court, while\nreducing the award, upheld recovery ofcompensatorydamages as a sanction\nfor contemptunder§295.14. 106Wis. 2dat 93-95. Thus, itisbeyonddispute\nthat, prior to the enactment ofCh. 785, the courts had the statutory authority\n13\n\nto award compensatory damages as a remedy for contempt ofcourt.\n2. Under the Clear and Unambiguous Language of §\n785.04(1)(a), Wisconsin Courts Retain the Power To\nAward Compensatory Damages as a Remedial\nSanction for Contempt ofCourt.\nWis. Stat. §785.04(1)(a) has statedsince 1979thatacourtmayimpose,\nas aremedialsanction,\"[p]aymentofasumofmoneysufficientto compensate\na partyfor a loss or injury suffered by the party as the result ofa contempt of\ncourt.\" The first step in construingany statuteis to lookto the languageofthe\nstatute itself and attempt to interpret it based on \"the plain meaning of its\nterms.\" State v. Williquette, 129 Wis. 2d 239, 248, 385 N.W.2d 145 (1986).\nIfthe language ofthe statuteis clearand unambiguous, the courtshouldapply\nit to the facts at hand without further analysis. See Turner v. Gene Dencker\nBuick-Pontiac, Inc., 2001 WIApp 28, ~14,240 Wis. 2d385,623 N.W.2d 151.\nAs the Court ofAppeals noted, the legislature's use ofthe past tense in the\nstatute at issue here \"plainly authorizes payment for injuries that occurred in\nthe past.\" (App. 11, ~ 12). Accordingly, as Judge Fine observed, it is\nunnecessary to go beyond this first step: \"Under Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1)(a)'s\nforthright and unambiguous directive, the plaintiffs are entitled to be\ncompensatedfor the losses and injuries they sufferedas aresultofMilwaukee\n[County]'s clear and blatant contempt.\" (App. 20, ~ 25).\n3. The Language, Structure, History and Purpose of\nChapter 785 Demonstrate the Legislature's Clear\nIntent To Continue To Provide Compensatory\nDamages as a Remedial Sanction for Contempt.\nNotwithstandingtheclearandunambiguoustermsof§ 785.04(a)(I),the\nCounty contends that the Circuit Court had no statutory authority to award\ncompensatory damages in this case because Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) defines\n14\n\n\"remedial sanction\" as \"a sanction imposed for the purpose ofterminating a\ncontinuing contempt of court.\" In the County's view, a Circuit Court is\npowerless to impose remedial sanctions for contempt unless the contempt is\n\"continuing,\"notonlyatthetime the contemptuousconductisdisclosedto the\ncourt, but also at the time that the court is able to act. (See, e.g., County Br.\n22). Thus where, as here, the County intentionally violated a consent decree\nthousands oftimes over two and a halfyears, but then stopped the violations\naftertheywerebroughtto the court's attention, inthe County'sview the court\nwouldhave no power to provide any contemptremedyto the victims ofthose\nviolations. And, under the County's view, ifit chooses to violate the decree\nagain, it willbe free to do so without fear ofhaving to compensate any future\nvictims ofits contempt,so long as itagain stops the violationsbefore the court\nis able to act.9\nThe County's narrow focus on § 785.01(3) obscures the language,\nstructure, history and purpose ofch. 785 as a whole. When the legislature\nenacted ch. 785, it did so against the backdrop of a long history of courts\nexercisingthe authorityto awardcompensatorydamagesunderbothcommon-\nlaw and statutory contempt powers. See Sections LA and LB.l, supra. The\nlegislature wished to preserve this authority, not to abolish it.\nAsnotedabove, the clearandunambiguous languageof§785.04(1)(a)\nprovides courts with the statutory authority to award monetary remedies to\ncompensate for a loss orinjurysuffered in the pastas the result ofa contempt\n'Contrary tothe County's assertion, itis indeedsuggestingthatitcan circumventthe\ncourt's authorityandthereby\"flaunt[sic] the requirements ofthe ConsentDecreewith\nimpunityso longas itcanstopbeforeacourtintervenes.\" (CountyBr. 31-32). This is\npreciselywhatit didinthis case, continuingto knowingly andintentionallyviolate the\ndecree fortwo andahalfyears until itwasbroughtinto courtonplaintiffs' discovery\nmotion inApril 2004, whenitfinally admittedtheviolations. SeeR242:1-5; R257:2-3.\n15\n\nofcourt, notjustfor a loss orinjury that is currently beingsufferedat the time\nthe court rules on a contempt motion. There is no evidence that, contrary to\nthe words the legislature chose, it actually intended to strip the courts of a\ncontempt remedy they had long exercised. Instead, the legislative history\nconfirmsthat \"[t]hesanctionslistedinthis section [785.04] are essentiallythe\nsame as under prior law.\" 1979 Wis. Laws 257, Committee Notes.lo As\ndiscussed above, under prior law, courts clearly had the authority to award\ncompensatory damages in such cases.\nSection 785.01(3)'s description ofa remedial sanction as \"a sanction\nimposed for the purpose of terminating a continuing contempt of court\"\nfocuses onlyonthecoercivefunction ofremedial (formerly\"civil\") contempt.\nThis description is under-inclusive and ignores the compensatory function of\ntraditional civil contempt remedies, a function reflected in § 785.04(1). See\nSchroeder v. Schroeder, 100 Wis. 2d 625, 637, 302 N.W.2d 475 (1981)\n(describing \"civil\" contempt as being either remedial or coercive in\ncomparison to the punitive purpose of\"criminal\" contempt). The definition\nsection of the statute, which in this instance serves primarily to distinguish\nbetween\"punitive\"and\"remedial\"sanctions(replacingtheold\"criminal\"and\n\"civil\"contemptnomenclature), shouldnotbereadin amannerthatundercuts\nthe substance ofthe statute as a whole.\nIn interpreting ch. 785, the Court should consider \"the role of the\nrelevant language in the entire statute\" and \"attempt to give effect to every\nword ofa statute, so as not to render any portion ofthe statute superfluous.\"\nIOTathe extentthere is anyambiguity createdby §785.04'sexpress authorization of\ncompensatorydamages as aremedial sanctionfor contemptand§785.01's definition of\nremedial sanctionsfor continuingcontempt, the Courtmayconsiderlegislative notes or\ncommentsto discern legislativeintent. See Grosse v. ProtectiveLifeIns. Co., 182Wis.\n2d97,110,513N.W.2d592 (1994).\n16\n\nIndustry to Indus., Inc. v. Hillsman ModularMolding, Inc., 2002 WI 51, ~ 8,\n252 Wis. 2d 544, 644 N.W.2d 236. By contrast, the County's reading ofthe\ndefinitional language of§ 785.01(3) ignores the purposes ofch. 785 and the\nspecific language of§ 785.04(1)(a); creates an unnecessary conflict between\nthose two sections ofch. 785; andwould rendermeaningless § 785.04(1)(a)'s\nspecific grantofauthorityto awardcompensatorydamages to thosewho have\nsuffered a loss or injury as a result of a party's contempt of court. The\nCounty's interpretation of§ 785.03(1) would also allow it, as it argued in the\ntrial court, to resume violating the consent decree in the future and to inflict\nwidespread harm again and again without fear of ever being required to\ncompensate its victims. (See, e.g., R244:4-5). As this Court statedinFrisch,\n\"[t]o determine the proper interpretation ofWis. Stat. § 785.01(3), we apply\nits plain meaning and interpret the statute to avoid [such] unreasonable and\nabsurd results.\" 2007 WI I02, ~ 39. See also Gasperv.

Chapter 785, when read as a whole and in\nlight of its legislative intent, history and purpose, gives the trial court\ndiscretion to impose remedial sanctions for any contempt of court that has\ncaused a party to suffer loss or injury, and to regard the contempt as\n\"continuing\" so long as the loss or injury goes unremedied.12\n4. Frisch Reaffirms the Circuit Court's Authority to\nAward Compensatory Damages to Plaintiffs.\nThe County argues that the Court ofAppeals' decision represents \"a\nwholesale departure from any traditional understanding of a trial court's\nremedial contempt powers under Chapter 785 and imposes an incorrect rule\nregarding continuing contempt.\" (County Br. 3). To the contrary, the Court\nof Appeals decision fully comports with the prior decisions of this Court,\n12Thisinterpretationofch. 785 is consistentwiththe analysis in anearly\ncontemporaneousarticle inwhich RobertMartineau, Reporterforthe WisconsinJudicial\nCouncilConunitteeonContempt(1979-80), discussedWisconsin's then-newcontempt\nstatute. SeeRobertJ. Martiueau, ContemptofCourt: Eliminatingthe Confusion Between\nCivilandCriminalContempt, 50U. Cin. L. Rev. 677, 701-02 (1981) (citations omitted):\nA moneysanctioncanbe imposedpursuantto subsection785.04(1)(a) ...\nArguably, impositionofabsolute ratherthanconditionalmoney damages\nas aremedial sanctionviolates the distinctionbetweenremedial and\npunitivesanctionsmade insubsection785.01(2)and(3) becausethe\nsanctionisbaseduponpastconductandisnot designedto terminate a\ncontinuingcontempt. Whilethis analysis superficiallymight seem\ncorrect, further analysis ofthe characterofmoneydamages for contempt\nsupports its treatment as aremedial sanction. Moneydamages have a\ndual function- restitution forpastcontemptandpreventionoffuture\ndamages. The remedysimplyrestores theparties to the statusquo\nbeforethe contemptoccurred.\nSeealso Griffin v. Reeve, 141 Wis. 2d699, 706nA, 416N.W.2d 612 (1987) (citing\nMartineau anddiscussed infra).\n18\n\nincluding its decisionjust last year in Frisch, 2007 WI 102.\nIn Frisch, Ronald Henrichs violated a court order, over a period of\nseveral years, requiring him annually to provide his ex-wife with tax and\nincome documentation. He eventually complied with the order before being\nfound in contempt, but his belated compliance cost his ex-wife $220,000 in\nchild support she would have received if he had provided accurate income\ninformation in atimelymanner. This Courtheld thatHenrichs' ex-wife, Heidi\nFrisch, was entitled to compensation as a result ofhis \"continuing contempt\"\nofcourtforpurposesofWis. Stat. §785.01(3). Ronald'scontemptallowedhim\nto \"evade exposure to the possibility of a modification of his child support\nobligation and thereby deprived Heidi and their children of their traditional\nremediesunderstatutorylaw.\" 2007 WI I02. ~ 81. According to the Court, the\n\"timelyprovisionofinformationwas anessentialelementofthe court'sorder.\"\nId.\nFailure to timely produce information, as required by the order, was\n\"the essence ofRonald's contemptbecause itshielded him from exposure to\nregular,contemporarycourt-orderedmodifications\"thatwouldhaveprevented\nor mitigated the harm. Id. ~ 47. The inability to correct a past contempt,\naccording to the Court, made the narrow interpretation of \"continuing\ncontempt\" urged by the County here - one requiring an ongoing violation at\nthetime sanctions areimposed, orallowingthe offendertopurgethe contempt\nmerely by belated compliance - \"too limited.\" Id. ~ 49. Here, as in Frisch,\n\"full compliance with the court's order is impossible and partial compliance\nwith the court's order is ineffectual.\" Id. ~ 62. Full compliance is impossible\nhere because members ofthe plaintiffclass have already been harmed by the\nCounty's two and ahalfyears ofnoncompliance with the consentdecree, and\npartialcompliancebythe Countynow isineffectualbecausethatharmremains\n19\n\nunremedied.\nAs Frisch recognized, this Court \"has put its imprimatur on a broad\ninterpretationofremedialcontemptin two importantcases\"(id. 'Il55): Griffin\nv. Reeve, 141 Wis. 2d699, 416N.W.2d 612 (1987), andLarsen v. Larsen, 165\nWis. 2d 679, 478 N.W.2d 18 (1992). In Griffin, the contemnor had failed to\npaycourt-orderedchildsupportuntil afterhis childhad reachedthe age of18.\nThe Court held that \"[a] parent's failure to pay child support after the child\nreaches majority is a continuing disobedience ofacourtorder. The contempt\nis not past; it is ongoing.\" 141 Wis. 2d at 708. Moreover, even though the\ncontemnorhadbelatedlypaid the amount due underthe supportorder, Griffin\n\"reject[ed] any notion that the contempt was not continuing or had been\npurged by the contemnor's payment ...,\" and thus approved the award of\nattorney fees and other consequential damages. Frisch, 2007 WI 102, 'Il 57\n(citing Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d at 700, 709).\nLarsen, according to the Court, has even \"broader ramifications for\ncontempt law.\" Frisch, 2007 WI 102,'Il58. Larsen notedthat\"itis within the\ncircuit court's inherent authority to grant purge conditions which allow\ncontemnors to purge theircontemptoutside ofcomplying withthe courtorder\nwhichledto the contempt.\" Larsen, 165 Wis. 2dat 685. Anypurgecondition\n\"should serve remedial aims, the contemnor should be able to fulfill the\nproposedpurge,andthe conditionshouldbe reasonablyrelatedto the causeor\nnature ofthe contempt.\" Id.\nThus, as Frisch recognized, this Court has long held that a contempt\nmay be \"continuing\" under § 785.01(3), and remedial sanctions may be\nimposed under § 785.04(1)(a), even where the contemnor has belatedly\ncomplied with a court order. Remedial sanctions are appropriate where, as\nhere, \"full compliance with the court's order is impossible, and partial\n20\n\ncompliance with the court's order is ineffectual. '\" Unless the court is able to\nfashion an alternative purge condition to compensate [the victims] for their\nloss, both [the victims] and the court have been defeated.\" Frisch, 2007 WI\n102, 'il62. As the Courtin Frisch concluded, \"when dealing with payment to\ncompensate aparty for aloss suffered as aresult ofcontempt, itispossible for\nthere to be a purge condition without a sanction or, in the alternative, for the\npurge condition to be the same as the sanction.\" Id. 'iI 63. Whether the\ncompensatorydamage awardsoughtinthepresentcaseisviewedasaremedial\nsanction or a purge condition, the court clearlyhas the power to order it.\nThe Court of Appeals correctly summarized these well-established\nprinciples as follows: \"[W]hen the purpose of the court's order has been\nthwarted for a substantial period oftime bynoncompliance, and the victim(s)\nofthenoncompliancehave sufferedunremediedinjuryasadirectresultofthat\nnoncompliance, a remedial sanction is not limited to belated technical\ncompliance with the face ofthe court's order.\" (App. 19,'il22) (citingFrisch,\n2007 WI 102, 'iI'iI54, 63, 64; Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d at 685; Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d\nat 708; Evans v. Luebke, 2003 WI App 207, 'iI'iI27, 30, 267 Wis. 2d 596, 671\nN.W.2d 304). Frisch and this Court'sprior decisions clearlyestablish that, in\nsuchcircumstances, a courthas the authority to compensate contemptvictims\nfor the harm they have suffered.\n5. The County's Attacks on Frisch Are Unavailing.\na. TheCourtofAppeals correctlyappliedFrisch.\nAmong its many attacks on the line ofcases culminatinginFrisch, the\nCountyargues thatFrisch is distinguishable from thepresentcase because (a)\nFrisch aroseinachild-supportcontext(CountyBr.27-28),and(b)theplaintiff\nin Frisch had lost her \"traditional remedy.\" (Id. 29). Neither distinction is\n21\n\npersuasive. WhiletheorderinFrisch was issuedpursuantto the FamilyCode,\nch. 767, the Court did not limit its holding to that narrow context. To the\ncontrary, the Court specifically noted that\"[t]he circuitcourtdid not proceed\nunder Wis. Stat. §767.32(1); rather, the circuitcourtproceeded with the case\nunder Wis. Stat. ch. 785 as a contempt proceeding and based on Ronald's\ncontemptuous conduct of intentionally failing to provide Heidi with tax\ninformation.\" 2007 WI 102, '\\[78.\nFrisch imposedno requirement that acontempt, in order to qualify for\nremedial sanctions, must \"deprive [a plaintiff] ofany existing remedy under\nthe law for any alleged harm.\" (County Br. 29). Instead, in describing the\nharm done to the plaintiffinFrisch, the Courtobserved that the contempthad\nthe effectof\"depriv[ing] Heidi ofher ability to utilize traditional remedies in\nthe law\"- viz., \"regular, contemporary court-ordered modifications ofchild\nsupport.\" Jd. '\\[47. In Frisch. the \"loss or injury suffered by the party as the\nresult ofa contemptofcourt,\" Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1)(a), was the deprivation\nofthe \"traditional remedy\" ofmodifications ofchild support; in the present\ncase, it is the harm that was done to members ofthe plaintiffclass when they\nwere held in inhumane conditions for extended periods in violation of the\ndecree. Inbothcases, the courthasthe authorityto imposeremedial sanctions\nfor contemptofcourtwithoutregardto whetherthe plaintiffs might also have\naccess to other legal remedies.13 Moreover, as the court below correctlyheld\n(App. 18, '\\[21 n.8):\nThe \"traditional remedy\" to which the Connty refers is\napparently aseparate civil action, either state orfederal,\nFrisch itselfdidnotrequire exhaustionofall otherpotential avenues ofrelief.

Such a\n\"traditional remedy\" would encourage a party to ignore\nobligations of a consent decree if the only practical\nremedywasnumerousindividuallawsuitsbyallvictimsof\nthe violations. We fail to see how that \"traditional\nremedy\" is either fair to the individual inmates who are\nclass members harmed by the County's actions here, or\nhow suchwouldbe an efficientuse ofjudicialresources,\nparticularly when the remedy of contempt has no such\nobstacles to enforcementofthe court's order.\nb. Frisch didnotannouncenewlaw andtherefore\nraises no issue ofretroactive application.\nTheCountynextarguesthatFrisch establisheda\"newprincipleoflaw\"\nthatwas\"notforecastbypriorprecedent,\"andthatits\"retroactive\"application\nwould not further the purpose of Frisch's holding and would produce\n\"substantial inequitable results.\" (County Br. 29_30).14 As demonstrated\nabove, and as the Court of Appeals recognized, however, the issue of\nretroactive application does not even arise in this case because Frisch merely\napplied Griffin, Larsen, and other long-established precedents;15 it was a\n14The Countyalso suggests that \"continuingcontempt,\" as understoodinFrisch andby\nthe CourtofAppealsbelow, is aslipperyslope towarda\"generaltortremedy\" whereby\nallcontempts are continuingunless avictimis compensated.

Compensationis\nlimitedto \"unusual\"circumstanceswhere\"fullcompliancewiththe conrl's orderis\nimpossible,\"\"partialcomplianceis ineffectual\" andthevictimotherwise\"cannotbe\nmade whole.\"Frisch, 2007WI 102,~62.

There isno suchdiscussion\ninFrisch.\n24\n\ncontempt has caused injuries that cannot be undone by belated compliance\nwith the court's order-is furthered, notretarded,by its application to provide\na remedy to the plaintiffs here. Application of Frisch to the present case\n\"promotesthe intentbehind the contemptstatute,whichis toprovidethecourt\nwithamechanism, ortoolbox, to effectcompliancewithcourtorders.\" Frisch,\n2007 WI 102,~ 82. Finally, the only\"inequitableresult\" ofwhich the County\ncomplains is that it might be held accountable to the victims ofits intentional\nviolations ofthe consentdecree. (See CountyBr. 31). In essence, the County\ncontends that it was entitled, under its view ofcontemptlaw, to intentionally\nviolate the consent decree and avoid accountability, as long as it stopped the\nviolations before a court could act. On the facts of this case, the equities\nclearly do not lie with the County, which seeks to evade the consequences of\nits longstanding contempt ofcourt, but with its victims, who are in need ofa\nremedy.\nc. The Court should not overrule Frisch.\nIn its final assault on Frisch, the County asks this Court to overrule\nitself. (CountyBr. 32-34). Notsurprisingly, the Countyhas notcited asingle\ncase in which the Court has overruled a case it decided just one year earlier.\nThe basic principles ofstare decisis demonstrate why this is so.\n\"Stare decisis is the motto ofcourts ofjustice.\" Ableman v. Booth, II\nWis. 498, 522 (1859). Adherence to stare decisis is essential to \"maintain\nconfidence in the reliability of court decisions, promote evenhanded,\npredictable and consistent development oflegal principles, and contribute to\nthe actual and perceived integrity of the Wisconsin judiciary.\" Dairyland\nGreyhound Park, Inc. v. Doyle, 2006 WI 107, ~ 93, 295 Wis; 2d 1, 719\nN.W.2d 408. \"Fidelity to precedent ensures that existing law will not be\n25\n\nabandoned lightly. When existing law is open to revision III every case,\ndeciding cases becomes a mere exercise ofjudicial will, with arbitrary and\nunpredictable results.\" ProgressiveN. Ins. Co. v. Romanshek, 2005 WI 67, '\\[\n42, 281 Wis. 2d 300, 697 N.W.2d 417 (citations and internal quotations\nomitted). Accordingly, courts must overcome \"a high hurdle ... when they\nseek to revisit pastprecedent.\" State v. Hansen, 2001 WI 53, '\\[46, 243 Wis.\n2d 328,627 N.W.2d 195 (Abrahamson, J., concurring). This hurdle is even\nhigherwhenthe decision in question construesastatute.Romanshek,2005 WI\n67, '\\[ 45 (\"stare decisis concerns are paramount where a court has\nauthoritatively interpreted a statute\").\nRelying on Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Employers Ins., 2003 WI 108, '\\[\n99,264 Wis. 2d 60, 665 N.W.2d 257, the County nonetheless argues that\nFrisch should be overruled on the ground that it is \"unsound in principle\"\nand/or \"unworkable in practice.\" (County Br. 33). The County neglects to\nmention, however, that in Johnson Controls \"[p]erhaps the most damning\nfactor\" weighing against the Court's continued adherence to a prior decision\nwas \"its failure to provide suitabledirection andconsistencyto this area ofthe\nlaw.\" !d. '\\[106. That failure became apparent only over the course ofmany\nyears and in the light ofjudicial experience, including a subsequent decision\nwhich \"severely undercut\" the case that Johnson Controls overruled. Id. '\\[\n102. Only in those circumstances did the Court find the \"compelling\njustification\" required to overrule a prior decision. Id. '\\[93. In its briefone \nyear lifetime, Frisch has not developed any record that is either unsound or\nunworkable, nor is there any other basis for taking the drastic step of\noverruling it. Instead, Frisch reconciles Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3)'s reference to\n\"continuing\" contempt with § 785.04(l)(a)'s express grant of authority \"to\ncompensate a party for a loss or injury suffered as the result ofa contempt,\"\n26\n\nand it does so in amannerconsistentwith the language, structure, history, and\npurpose ofch. 785 and with the courts' inherent contempt powers. It would\nviolate well-settled principles ofstare decisis to overrule Frisch.\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS PROPERLY DIRECTED THE\nCIRCUIT COURT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE\nCOMPENSATION.\nThe Court of Appeals remanded this case to the trial court \"to\ndetermine, in light ofthis decision andWis. Stat. §785.04, the 'sumofmoney\nsufficientto compensate' the inmates held in violation ofthe ConsentDecree\nfor the 'loss or injury suffered,' and such further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinionasmaybeappropriate.\" (App. 19,-,r24). The County,misreading\nthe terms ofthe remand, argues that this directive \"eliminated any discretion\non the part of the Circuit Court In determining the proper remedy, if any,\namong those available to it ....\" (County Br. 35).\nThe CourtofAppeals, however, didno suchthing. Instead, faced with\nacaseinwhichthetrialcourthadwithhelditsdiscretionbasedonits erroneous\nbeliefthat ithad no authority to order compensation under ch. 785, the Court\nof Appeals directed it to exercise that discretion. Contrary to the County's\nassertion, the trial court has not been ordered to compensate \"any prisoners\nheldinthebookingareaofthe Jailin excessofthirtyhours.\" (CountyBr. 35).\nRather, it has been directed to determine the sum of money sufficient to\ncompensate inmates \"for the 'loss or injury [they] suffered,'\" and to conduct\nfurther proceedings as appropriate. (App. 19, -,r 24). If the trial court\ndetermines that inmates have not suffered any compensable loss or injury,\nthose inmates will not be entitled to any sum ofmoney, although they might\n27\n\nbe entitled to other remedial sanctions under § 785.0416\nThe Countyalso contends thatitisnotawareofanyothercasein which\nadefendanthasbeenrequiredtopaycompensatorydamages directlyto a class\nof inmates solely for past violations of a decree. (County Br. 36-37).\nPlaintiffs are unaware ofany other case in which a defendant has engaged in\nmore than 16,000 intentionalviolations ofa consentdecree for two and a half\nyears andthenescapedfrom liabilityfortheharm itcausedbyholdinginmates\ninsqualidconditionsfor extendedperiods.\" We are, however, aware ofcases\nin which, for example, it has been held to be \"clear error\" to refuse to award\ncompensatory damages to the victim ofa violation of a consent decree in a\nprisoner class action \"once actual injuries are shown.\" Milburn v. Coughlin,\n83 Fed. Appx. 378, 380, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 25137 (2d Cir. Dec. 12,\n2003). As the court in Milburn stated in language that is directly applicable\nhere:\nThe assessment of monetary sanctions in a civil contempt proceeding\nserves twopurposes: to coercefuture complianceandto compensate the\nplaintiff for any harms caused by the contempt. ... With regard to the\nsecondpurpose, the amountofthe compensatoryawardmustbebasedon\na showing ofactual injury.... However, once actual injuries are shown,\ncompensatory damages must be awarded. See Vuitton et Fils S.A. v.\nCarouselHandbags,592F.2d126,130(2dCir.[1979])(\"Thedistrictcourt\nThe CourtofAppeals' directive tothe trial courtto applycompensatorysanctionswas\n16\ndeterminedbythe facts ofthis case.

May 28, 1993) (courts have\n\"repeatedly upheld the availability of compensatory damages to individual\nclass members who establish that prison officials have violated the terms of\nclass consent decrees and judgments\"). And courts have held that such\ndamages are available to prisoners who have been harmed solely by past\nviolations ofclass-actionconsentdecrees. See, e.g., Picon v. Morris, 933 F.2d\n660, 662-63 & n.3 (8th Cir. 1991) (recognizing availability of contempt\ndamages to former prisoner harmed by violations of class-action consent\ndecree occurring while prisoner was incarcerated); Carty v. Dejongh, 48 V.L\n801,844,2007U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23330, *87 (D.V.L, Feb. 27, 2007)(\"A court\nmay impose fines following a contempt finding. These fines may 'seek to\ncompensate the complainants...for damages caused by past acts of\ndisobedience.' ... 'Alternatively,thecourtmayexerciseitsequitablepowerand\norder that the sanction be used to remedy the problems underlying the\ncontempt finding.\"') (citations omitted); Welch v. Spengler, 939 F. 2d 570,\n572-73 (8th Cir. 1991) (compensatory fines may be awarded to inmate class\nmembers who canproveactualharm as aresultofviolations ofprison consent\ndecree; nominal damages may be awarded without proofofactual loss).\nThe County obscures the issue with a smokescreen of procedural\nobjections throughwhichitquestionsthe CircuitCourt'sabilityto observethe\ndueprocess rights oftheparties (CountyBr. 38)andto efficientlymanage this\nclass litigation. (Id., 38-40). In essence, the County argues that it should be\nexcused from liabilitybecause its intentional violations ofthe consentdecree\ndamaged thousands of inmates rather than just a few, thereby making the\n29\n\nremedial process more complicated and time-consuming. However, if\n18\ncompensationis an appropriateremedy for an individual harmedby contempt\nof court, then it is also appropriate where there are multiple victims. The\nCircuit Court in this case should be presumed competent to exercise its\ndiscretion to fashion appropriate monetary relief for class members who\nsuffered loss or injury as aresultofthe County's contempt. Accordingly, this\ncase should be remanded to the Circuit Court so that it can properly exercise\nits discretion in accordance with the directions ofthe Court ofAppeals.\nIII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT IT\nCOULD NOT AWARD DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF\nCONTRACT.\nThe CourtofAppeals declined to reach the plaintiffs' contract claims,\nfindingthatitsholdingfortheplaintiffsoncontemptremedieswasdispositive.\nShould this Courtdetermine that it is necessary to decide the contractclaims,\nit may either remand to the Court ofAppeals or decide the issue itself. State\nv. Johnson, 153 Wis. 2d 121, 123 & 126,449 N.W.2d 845 (1990); In the\nInterest ofJamie L., 172 Wis. 2d 218, 233, 493 N.W.2d 56 (1992). Because\nthis Courtmayelecttoreachthe contractissue,plaintiffspresentthe argument\nThe Countyresortsto inflammatoryspeculationto suggestthattaxpayers will\n18\n\"necessarilybearthe burden offunding apotentiallydrastic award ofdamages tothe\nplaintiffclass\" andthat snch damageswillbeto the \"detrimentofongoingefforts to fund\nand implementotherimprovementsintheJail.\" (CountyBr. 38;seealso id.at31).

Johnson, 153 Wis. 2d at 124 (to preserve claim appealed but not\ndecided by court of appeals, respondent must discuss issue in its brief).\nHowever, appellate courts often prefer to allow lower courts to address the\nissues not decided below in order to benefit from the lower court's analysis.\nSee, e.g., State v. Marshall, 113 Wis. 2d 643, 656, 335 N.W.2d 612 (1993);\nState v. McConnohie, 113 Wis. 2d362, 375, 334 N.W.2d 903 (1983). In fact,\ninJamieL., the Court's mostcomprehensive opiniononpreserving issues not\naddressed by the courtofappeals, this Court remanded unaddressed issues to\nthe Court ofAppeals. 172 Wis. 2d at 231.\nA consentdecree is enforceable as ajudgment and as acontract. Klein\nv. Board ofRegents, 2003 WI App. 118, ~~ 14-16,265 Wis. 2d 543, 666\nN.W.2d 67; see also Kocinski v. Home Ins. Co., 154 Wis. 2d 56, 67-68, 452\nN.W.2d 360 (1990) (settlement agreement is an enforceable contract). Itmay\nbe enforced through supplementary proceedings in the original action, rather\nthan by filing a new action. See Hensley v. Alcon Laboratories, Inc., 277 F.3d\n535,540 (4th Cir. 2002); 15A Am. Jur. 2d, Compromise & Settlement § 49.\nThe breach of a settlement agreement may result in traditional contract\nremedies, includingdamages. 15AAm. Jur. 2d, Compromise& Settlement§§\n49-51; Pasternak\"v. Pasternak, 14 Wis. 2d38, 43-44, 109N.W.2d 511 (1961)\n(stipulationofsettlementofcourtproceedingsisbindingcontractandsupports\njudgment for damages).\nThis class action has, since its inception, been aboutproviding beds to\ninmates previously forced to sleep on floors and benches in crowded and\nunsanitary conditions. See (RI2:7-10, Class Complaint). In settling this\nlitigation, the defendants expresslypromised notto hold future inmatesunder\nsuch conditions. Recognizing that \"there are no beds in the booking room,\"\nthe defendants promised that inmates would be kept there \"fornotmore than\n31\n\nthirty hours.\" (RI54:4 § II, ~~ C & D, App. 38). The defendants broke their\npromise 16,662 times, subjecting prisoners to exactly the emotional and\nphysical harm the settlement agreement was designed to prevent. As in any\ntypicalcontractaction, the defendants shouldbeheld liable forthe natural and\nforeseeable consequencesoftheirbreachandbe requiredto compensate those\nharmed. Kramer v. Bd. ofEduc., 2001 WI App. 244, ~ 10,248 Wis. 2d. 333,\n635 N.W.2d 857.\nDespite finding that the defendants breached the agreement, the trial\ncourt denied monetary damages, on the grounds that (1) the parties had not\nnegotiatedforaliquidateddamagesprovisioninthe consentdecree,(R282:11 \n12, App. 31-32), and (2) the initial action sought and the resulting consent\ndecreeprovided injunctivereliefratherthanmonetarydamages. (R282:12-13,\nApp. 32-33). The Circuit Court's ruling is contrary to established contract\nlaw. Parties to a contract may specify liquidated damages, but are in no way\nrequired to do so. Compare Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 346(1)\n(1981) (\"[t]he injuredpartyhas arightto damages for anybreach\") (emphasis\nadded) with §356(1) (\"[d]amagesforbreach byeitherpartymaybe liquidated\nin the agreement\") (emphasis added).\nFurther,theusualremedyforbreach-of-contractobligationsisdamages,\nnot specific performance. Ordinarily, \"specific performance will not be\ndecreed unless the remedy at law is inadequate.\" Welch v. Chippewa Sales\nCo.,252Wis. 166, 168,31 N.W.2d170(1948);seealsoRestatement(Second)\nofContracts, § 359 (1981). The plaintiffs originally sought injunctive and\ndeclaratoryreliefand,whenresolvingthoseclaimsthroughsettlement,entered\ninto a contract requiring certain actions of the defendants to protect the\nconstitutional rights ofclass members. Nothing in the terms ofthe settlement\n32\n\nprecludeda damages remedyifthe defendants failed to performtheirduties.\"\nNowplaintiffsseekto recoverdamages- thecustomarycontractremedy- for\nthe defendants' breach. See, e.g.,Magestro v. North StarEnvtl. Const., 2002\nWI App. 182, '\\l10, 256 Wis. 2d 744, 649 N.W.2d 722 (\"Contract damages\nshouldcompensate thewrongedpartyfordamagesthatarisenaturallyfromthe\nbreach; said damages are limited by the concept offoreseeability. However,\ninadditiontothesecompensatorydamages, apartycanalso seekconsequential\ndamages.\") (citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs are entitled to a remedy that will restore them to the position\nthey would have enjoyed had the defendants not breached the contract. See\nThorp Sales Corp. v. Gyuro Grading Co., 111 Wis. 2d431,438, 331 N.W.2d\n342 (1983). Damages for humiliation, emotionaldistress, and mental anguish\nmay be recovered for the defendants' breach. Restatement (Second) of\nContracts, §353 (1981) (damagesforemotionalharmmayberecoveredwhere\n\"the breach also caused bodily harm or the contractor the breach is ofsuch a\nkind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result\").\nCourts have held that such damages are recoverable where \"the breach ofthe\nsettlementagreementwas ofakind likelytoinducesevereemotionaldistress.\"\nMunday v. Waste Management ofNorth America, Inc., 997 F. Supp. 681,687\n(D. Md. 1998) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 353); see also\nStockdale v. Baba, 153 Ohio App. 3d 712, 734, 795 N.E.2d 727 (Ct.

InHuskey v. NationalBroadcasting Co., 632 F. Supp. 1282, 1292-94\n(N.D. Ill. 1986), the courtheldthat an inmatecould state a claim forbreachof\nan agreement notto photograph prisoners without consent and could recover\ndamages for emotionalharm. Citingboth5 Corbin on Contracts §I076 at429\n(1964 ed.) and the Restatement, the court held that contract damages for\nmental suffering could be awarded when the contracting party had \"reason to\nknow when the contract was made that a breach would cause such [mental]\nsuffering, for reasons other than mere pecuniary loss.\" Id. at 1293.\nHeretheCountycouldforesee thatemotionaldistress,humiliation, and\nmental anguish would result from holding prisoners for extended periods\nwithout beds. Indeed, the decree did anticipate the type of harm that would\nresult from a violation ofthe 3D-hourrule. (RI54:4 §II, '11'11 C and D, App. 38\n(Consent Decree)). Monetary damages are the most effective remedy to put\nthe victims of this breach in the position they would have been in had the\nsettlement agreement not been breached, and plaintiffs are entitled to this\nremedy.\n34\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, respondents respectfully request that the\ndecision ofthe Court ofAppeals be affirmed.\nDated this 7th Day ofJuly, 2008.\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs-Appellants\nBy:\nPeter M.

Arguments heard. Court DENIES plaintiff's petition for attorney's fees, costs\nand expenses against defendant WI DOC. Court GRANTS plaintiff's petition for attorney fees for\nthe work of Legal Aid Society as court appointed counsel against defendants Milwaukee County\nSheriff and Milwaukee County. The court finds that the only issues remaining are what the hourly\nrate for compensation of attorneys' fees should be and whether the number of hours should be\nreduced by work performed in opposition to DOC or by duplication. Parties have 30 days to\nsubmit up to 5 affidavits regarding theses issues. Plaintiff's have 60 days to further itemize the\nhours submitted so as to isolate hours spent on work against the DOC and to identify work that\nmay or may not be duplicative. The court finds that the ACLU is entitled to attorneys fees and\nexpenses because the court appointed the Legal Aid Society.

Reversedandcause remandedwith directions.\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nn.\nBeforeWedemeyer, Fine andKessler,\n~I KESSLER, J. When the trial court concluded that sanctions or\ncompensation for continuing contempt were not available because Milwaukee\nCounty (County) had ceased violating the Consent Decree on which the trial court\nbased its finding of contempt, it did not have the benefit of our supreme court's\nholdings in Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, _ Wis. 2d _, 736 N.W.2d 85,\ndecided in July 2007, while this appeal was pending. We conclude that the\nremedy of sanctions under WIS. STAT. § 785.04 for continuing contempt, as\ndescribed in Frisch, is applicable to the contempt found by the trial court here.\nWe reverse and remand for determination ofthe amount ofthe sanction.\nBackground\n~2 In March 1996, Milton Christensen, who was then confined in the\nMilwaukee County Jail, filed a pro se, handwritten petition for a writ of\nprohibition seeking relief from what he described as dangerous conditions within\nthe jail. Shortly thereafter, the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, Inc. began\nI\nrepresenting Christensen, and in July 1996, filed a class action complaint2 on\nbehalf of \"all persons who are now or in the future will be confined in the\nMilwaukee CountyJail,\" alleging constitutional violations by the defendants based\nupon the conditions maintained in the jail. In the proceedings giving rise to this\nThe Legal Aid Society was later joined by the American Civil Liberties Union of\n1\nWisconsin Foundation and individual cooperating counsel, all of whom participated in this\nappeal.\n2 The individual defendants were sued in their representative capacities. Robert\nKliesmet and Lev Baldwin served successively as SheriffofMilwaukee County. The Secretary\nofthe WisconsinDepartmentofCorrections(DOC), MichaelJ. Sullivan, was dismissed from this\ncaseafterasettlementwasreachedbetweentheDOC andtheplaintiffclass.\n2\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nappeal, the trial court summarized the lengthy complaint as alleging \"that the\nconditions at the Milwaukee County Jail were substandard, lead to the infliction of\nneedless pain and suffering, and created a threat to the inmates' mental and\nphysical well-being. These conditions were presumably caused by [] serious\novercrowding problems at the Jail.\"\n~3 Ultimately, the parties resolved their differences and in March 200I,\nentered into a forty-eight page settlement agreement (referred to bythe parties and\nthe trial court as a Consent Decree), which was approved by the trial court in May\n2001, and became an order ofthe court.3 Problems with thejail conditions did not\nend, and by late 2003, plaintiffs requested, and the trial court ·authorized over\nopposition by the County, investigation and discovery on the question of\ndefendants' compliance with the Consent Decree.\n~4 In the fall of2004, plaintiffs moved for enforcement ofthe Consent\nDecree, alleging numerous and persistent violations thereof by defendants.\nPlaintiffs sought a finding of contempt and damages for breach of contract, i.e.,\nthe terms ofthe Consent Decree. In the trial court's decision and order resolving\nthat motion, the trial court4 provided an excellent summary ofthe portions ofthe\nConsent Decree relevant to these proceedings, and the factual positions of the\nparties related thereto, which we adopt and set forth in substantial part herein with\nemphasis as supplied by the trial court:\n3 The Honorable Thomas E. Doneganpresided overthe initialproceedings and approved\nthe ConsentDecree.\n4 The Honorable Clare L. Fiorenza presided over the later enforcement proceedings\nwhich are the subjectofthis appeal.\n3\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nThe Consent Decree is divided into two parts. One\npart deals with inmate overcrowding and the other deals\nwith the medical services provided to inmates. The\nprovision of the Consent Decree at issue in the present\nmotionbefore this Courtinvolves inmates' length ofstayin\nthe booking/open waiting area of the jail. The relevant\nportionofthe ConsentDecreeprovides as follows:\nC. As of3/21101, and thereafter, no jail inmate shall\nbe required to sleep on a mattress on thejail floor\nor on the jail floor. There shall be no inmate in\nthe jail for longer than thirty hours without\nbeing assignedto abedapproved by regulations of\nthe Wisconsin Department of Corrections for\novernight housing. (See Paragraph D, next\nfollowing).\nD. Best efforts shall be made to assure that there will\nbe no more than 110 inmates in booking area at\nthe midnight count. If the number exceeds 110,\nthere shall be a plan for adequate emergency\nstaffing in the booking room. The plan shall limit\nthe number of inmates in the locked rooms\nsurrounding the open waiting area in the booking\nroom and shall specifyhow often those side rooms\nare checked. The maximumpermanentpopulation\nlimit for the jail shall be 1100 at the midnight,\n\"11:59,\" count (according to the so-called \"Daily\nCensus Reports\"). The 1100 permanent capacity\nlimit of the jail assumes that there will be a\nreasonable number ofpersons held on a short-term\nbasis in the booking area. Since there are no\nbeds in the booking room, a number ofinmates\nmay be placed there for not more than thirty\nhours. County defendants will exercise best\nefforts to limit any inmate's stay in booking \nopen waiting to twenty-four hours.\n(Consent Decree, Section II, Paragraphs C and D,\nemphasis added.)\n~5 As to the material facts, the trial courtreported substantial agreement\nbetween the parties, noting: \"Plaintiffs maintain that this 'thirty-hour' requirement\nwas violated on 16,662 occasions from November of2001 through April of2004.\n4\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nThe County does not dispute that there were, in fact, approximately 16,000 such\nviolations.\" Relying on WIS. STAT. §§ 785.01 and 785.02 (2005-06),5 and\nShepard v. Circuit Court for Outagamie County, 189 Wis. 2d 279, 287, 525\nN.W.2d 764 (Ct. App. 1994), the trial court found 16,662 violations between\nNovember 2001 and May 2004. The trial court made additional findings that:\n[T]he actions of Milwaukee County officials were\nintentional. The sheer number of violations, 16,662 is\nstaggering. These violations spanned a relatively long\nperiod of time, from approximately November of 2001\n(only months after the Consent Decree was approved by\nJudge Donegan) until May of2004. Although Milwaukee\nCounty contends that it was unaware of the extent of the\nproblem, it is beyond this Court's comprehension how over\n16,000 violations of the Consent Decree could. go\nundetected.\nMilwaukee County officials had the capability to track how\nlong inmates were being held in the booking/open waiting\narea....\nInmates who were held in booking for longer than seventy \ntwo (72) hours were given showers and new clothes....\n[T]he existence ofthe shower list also demonstrates ... that\nthe County actually knew that the Consent Decree was\nbeing violated.\nMilwaukee County was put on notice ofproblems\nin the booking area in December of 2002 and January of\n2003 when the County Board Judiciary Committee was\nforced to respond to complaints from Sheriff's Deputies\nthat overcrowding in the booking area was creating unsafe\nworking conditions....\nAmong the conditions described by some ofthe Plaintiffs\n(and not directly contradicted by the Affidavits submitted\nbyMilwaukee County) include: overly crowded conditions,\ninmates who were forced to sit or sleep on the floor next to\nurinals, inmates who had to sit-up for hours and hours, lack\nof hygiene, unsanitary conditions, inmates who were not\nAll references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2005-06 version unless otherwise\n5\nnoted.\n5\n\nNo. 2006AP803\ngiven pillows or blankets to sleep on, cells that were\ninfested with bugs, cold temperatures, bodily fluids on the\nfloor and bad odors.... [B]etween November of2001 and\nApril of2004, 4811 inmates were kept in this environment\nfor longer than two days, and 719 inmates were held there\nfor more than three (3) days. Some ofthese inmates were\nheld inbooking in excess of100hours....\nIt is quite telling that the thirty-hour violations ceased\nimmediately after the Plaintiffs filed this motion to enforce\nits [sic] rights under the Consent Decree. The speed at\nwhich Milwaukee County was able to remedy the problem\nand improve the conditions in the booking area\ndemonstrates that had the County made a serious effort to\ncomply with the thirty-hour requirement, it could have\nprevented the violations.\n~6 On January 4, 2006, although the trial court specifically found that\n\"Milwaukee County's actions were intentional and constitute Contempt ofCourt\"\nthe trial court concluded that \"the remedial sanctions that the PlaintiffClass seeks,\nbased upon a plain reading of the applicable statutes, is not available.\" The trial\ncourt concluded that remedial sanctions were only available to terminate a\ncontinuing contempt, and since the parties agreed that the violations ofthe thirty \nhour rule ended in June 2005, the trial court concluded that there was no\ncontinuing contempt. In addition, the trial court, analyzing the Consent Decree as\na contract, found that Milwaukee County had breached the Consent Decree, but\nthat damages based on that breach were not available because: the 2001 complaint\n(which ultimatelyresulted in the Consent Decree) did not request money damages;\nprior to the trial court approving the Consent Decree, plaintiffs' counsel stated\nrepeatedly that the relief sought applied to conditions for the inmates, not to\nmoney damages; and the language of the Consent Decree does not \"indicate that\neither party contemplated that monetary damages would be available in the event\nofa breach.\" Plaintiffs appealed.\n6\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nStandardofreview\n~7 Interpretation of WIS. STAT. ch. 785 is a question of law that we\nreview de novo. Rosario v. Acuity & Oliver Adjustment Co., 2007 WI App 194,\n~8, _ Wis. 2d_, 738 N.W.2d 608. Whether the trial court had the authority to\napply remedial contempt sanctions under the facts found requires interpretation\nand application of a statute, which is a question of law that we review de novo.\nFrisch v. Henrichs, 736 N.W.2d 85, ~29; see also Evans v. Luebke, 2003 WI App\n207, ~16, 267 Wis. 2d 596, 671 N.W.2d 304; Shepard, 189 Wis. 2d at 286.\nContempt\n~8 Milwaukee County does not appeal the finding that it was in\ncontempt of the trial court's order approving the Consent Decree based on more\nthan 16,000 violations over a period of twenty-nine months, and that those\nviolations were intentionaL \"The legal definition of 'intentional' is essentially the\nsame, whether found in tort law or in criminal law, and we see no reason to use a\nseparate definition when interpreting the same word used in the contempt statute.\"\nShepard, 189 Wis. 2d at 286-87. Nor is there a claim that an improper procedure\nwas used in determining whether intentional violation of the order occurred. We\nare concerned here only with whether financial sanctions may be imposed to purge\nthe contempt found by the trial court in this case.\n~9 The power to enforce its orders by exercise of contempt powers is\ninherent to a court. Frisch, 736 N.W.2d 85, ~32. For more than one hundred\ntwenty years, our courts have acceded to legislative statutes which proscribe\nprocedure or penalty limitations. See Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ~17 (relying on\nState ex rel. Lanning v. Lonsdale, 48 Wis. 348, 367, 4 N.W. 390 (1880)). \"The\nlegislature may regulate and limit the contempt power 'so long as the contempt\n7\n\nNo. 2006AP803\npower is not rendered ineffectua1.'\" Frisch, 736 N.W.2d 85, ~32 (internal citation\nomitted).\n~10 Wisconsin statutes permit a court to enforce its orders by imposing\neither remedial or punitive sanctions. See WIS. STAT. §785.04. Punitive\nsanctions focus on upholding the authority of the court, must be pursued by the\ndistrict attorney or other prosecuting authority unless the contempt occurs in the\npresence of the court, and are conducted under the rules of criminal procedure.\nSee WIS. STAT. §785.03(1)(b); Frisch, 736 N.W.2d 85, ~34; Diane KJ. v. James\nL.J., 196 Wis. 2d 964, 969, 539 N.W.2d 703 (Ct. App. 1995) (Punitive contempt\nis not concerned with private interests of a 1itigant.); State v. Chinavare, 185\nWis. 2d 528,529-30,518 N.W.2d 772 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"A complaint issuedunder\n[WIS. STAT.] § 785.03(1) ... 'shall be processed under [WIS. STAT.] chs. 967 to\n973.\"'). Remedial sanctions, however, focus on the rights of the victim of the\ndisobedience to the court order. Section 785.03(1)(a). Such sanctions may be\nrequested by any victim of contumacious conduct, and the statutes provide\nremedies for the contempt which are aimed at ending the harm to the victim\nresulting from noncompliance with the order. See § 785.03(1)(b); Frisch, 736\nN.W.2d 85, ~35; State v. King, 82 Wis. 2d 124, 130, 262 N.W.2d 80 (1978);\nDiane KJ., 196 Wis.2d at 968. The harm of noncompliance, in some\ncircumstances, may not be remedied merely by a belated compliance with the\norder sought to be enforced. See Frisch, 736 N.W.2d 85, ~~42, 43 & 47.\n~11 Here, we are concerned only with the remedial sanctions for which\nthe legislature has provided, in WIS. STAT. §§ 785.01(2), (3) and 785.04:\n785.01 Definitions. In this chapter: ... (2) \"Punitive\nsanction\" means a sanction imposed to punish a past\ncontempt of court for the purpose of upholding the\nauthority ofthe court.\n8\n\nNo. 2006AP803\n(3) \"Remedial sanction\" means a sanction imposed for the\npurpose ofterminating acontinuingcontemptofcourt.\n785.04 Sanctions·authorized.\n(1) REMEDIAL SANCTION. A court may Impose one or\nmore ofthe following remedial sanctions:\n(a) Paymentofa sum ofmoney sufficient to compensate a\nparty for a loss or injury suffered by the party as the result\nofa contemptofcourt.\n(b) Imprisonment if the contempt of court is of a type\nincluded in s. 785.01 (1) (b), (bm), (c) or (d). The\nimprisonment may extend only so long as the person is\ncommitting the contempt ofcourt or 6 months, whichever\nis the shorterperiod.\n(c) A forfeiture not to exceed $2,000 for each day the\ncontemptofcourtcontinues.\n(d) An order designed to ensure compliance with a prior\norderofthe court.\n(e) A sanction other than the sanctions specified in pars.\n(a) to (d) ifit expressly finds that those sanctions would be\nineffectual to terminate acontinuingcontemptofcourt.\n'1[12 Statutory construction '''begins with the language of the statute. If\nthe meaning ofthe statute is plain, we ordinarily stop the inquiry.'\" State ex rei.\nKalal v. Circuit Courtfor Dane County, 2004 WI 58, '1[45, 271 Wis. 2d 633,681\nN.W.2d 110 (citation omitted). The legislature, in WIS. STAT. § 785.04(1)(a),\nspecifically authorizes payment of money to compensate a victim for an \"injury\nsuffered by the party as the result ofa contempt ofcourt.\" Use ofthe past tense in\nthe statute plainly authorizes payment for injuries that occurred in the past. The\nlegislature apparently recognized that bringing a party into compliance with a\ncourt order did not necessarily cure the harm the victim ofthe noncompliance had\nalready sustained because ofthe violation ofthe court order.\n9\n\nNo. 2006AP803\n~13 Under WIS. STAT. ch. 785, our courts have imposed, or approved,\nthe payment ofmoney to the victim ofdisobedience to the court order as remedial\nsanctions for injury sustained, although. the disobedience had ended when the\nfinancial sanction was, or was to be, determined. In Griffin v. Reeve, 141 Wis. 2d\n699, 416 N.W.2d 612 (1987), the court held that contempt was an appropriate\nremedy for a court to utilize to enforce past due child support payments after the\nchild has reached majority. Id. at 704. The case arose out ofa divorce from a ten \nyear marriage in which the mother was awarded sole custody ofthe minor child,\nand the father was given reasonable visitation rights and ordered to pay $25 in\nchild support on a weekly basis until the child became self-supporting or reached\nthe age of eighteen, whichever occurred first. Ido at 701. At the time the child\nreached the age of eighteen, the father owed $5375. Ido Two months after the\nchild reached eighteen, the contempt action was filed, whereupon the father paid\nto the mother $3500. Ido at 701-02. Thereafter, the circuit court dismissed the\naction on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because the child was eighteen\nyears old. Id. at 702. The supreme court tookthe case on bypass. Ido at 700.\n,\n~14 In support ofhis argument that contempt remedies are not available\nonce a child is no longer a minor, the father argued that \"[t]he purpose of a\nremedial sanction under ch. 785 in child support actions is to insure present and\nfuture compliance.... Once the child reaches the age of majority, the child no\nlonger needs the remedy ofcontempt to protect his or her welfare.\" /do at 707-08.\nThis is so, he argued, because a contempt action for failure to pay child support is\na sanction for past contempt, which is a punitive sanction, for which a private\npartycannot bring an action. Id. at 708.\n~15 In concluding that contempt was an appropriate remedy and that a\ncourt retained jurisdiction to enforce its support orders even after a child reached\n10\n\nNo. 2006AP803\nthe age ofmajority, the supreme court held that such a contempt proceeding was\n\"not to punish a past contempt but to coerce [the father] into complying with an\nexisting court order.\" Id. If the amount ordered is not paid, even ifa child is at\nthe age of majority, the contempt continues, \"achiev[ing] the purpose of the\nremedial sanction, namely to provide a mechanism to effect compliance with the\ncourt-ordered duty to support\" as its \"dominant purpose ... is to aid the private\nlitigant.\" Id.\n~16In Larsen v. Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d 679, 478 N.W.2d 18 (1992), the\nsupreme court addressed a Wisconsin court's inherent authority to impose purge\nconditions outside of the mere compliance with the violated order. Larsen, a\nVietnam War veteran, repeatedly failed to make child support payments pursuant\nto a divorce decree. Id. at 681. The trial court's attempts to enforce its support\norder, including numerous contempt proceedings and reductions in the level of\nsupport, met with minimal success, and the court found Larsen in contempt under\nWIS. STAT. § 785.01(1)(b), ordering Larsen to serve ninety days in jail as a\nremedial sanction. Id. at 682. The trial court determined that Larsen's contempt\nrelated to his inability to obtain employment, and that this inability to find work\nwas directly related to his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), for which he\nrefused treatment. Id. The court granted Larsen an opportunity to stay the jail\nsentence and purge his contempt by agreeing to seek treatment for his PTSD and\nseek employment. Id.\n~17 On appeal, Larsen contended that because the purge condition was\ntantamount to an involuntary commitment under WIS. STAT. ch. 51, he was\nentitled \"to receive all the due process safeguards afforded\" thereunder. Id. at\n683. The supreme court concluded that under the facts ofLarsen, the court had\nnot ordered an involuntary commitment, but rather ajail sentence. Because \"the\n11\n\nNo. 2006AP803\ntreatment was only a purge condition, exercisable at Larsen's will,\" and was not\nordered as a remedial sanction, which would have required a ch. 51 hearing,\nLarsen's due process rights were not violated. Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d at 684-85. In\ndiscussing remedial sanctions andpurge conditions under WIS. STAT. § 785.04, the\ncourt noted that \"it is within the circuit court's inherent authority to grant purge\nconditions which allow contemnors to purge their contempt outside ofcomplying\nwith the court order which led to the contempt.\" Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d at 685. It\nthen set forth the following rule: \"If a circuit court grants a purge condition, the\npurge condition should serve remedial aims, the contemnor should be able to\nfulfill the proposed purge, and the condition should be reasonably related to the\ncause or nature ofthe contempt.\" Id.\n~18 In Evans v. Luebke, 2003 WI App 207, 267 Wis. 2d 596, 671\nN.W.2d 304, we determined that an attorney who was guardian ad litem for minor\nchildren was in contempt when she did not follow a trial court order that she\ndeposit the proceeds ofa minor settlementin specific bank accounts for the benefit\nofthe minors. Id., ~22. We rejected the attorney's claim that the action to recover\nthe funds was really litigation based on negligence (as to which she asserted\nvarious defenses), holding that the trial court had the authority under WIS. STAT.\nch. 785 to impose remedial sanctions because its order had been, and was being,\nignored. Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ~~9, 14 & 15. The trial court ordered the\nattorney to: (I) deposit the missing funds in separate accounts as initially ordered;\n(2) add the interest lost during non-compliance; (3) pay the attorney fees of the\nsubsequent guardian ad litem who brought the action to get the money back; and\n(4) return the fees earlier approved for her work in obtaining the minor settlement.\nId., ~~7-8. We concluded that \"what the circuit court imposed in this case were\n'remedial sanctions,' i.e., ones 'imposed for the purpose of terminating a\n12\n\nNo. 2006AP803\ncontinuing contempt'\" based on the definition in WIS. STAT. §785.01(3). Luebke,\n267 Wis. 2d 596, ,-rn. Although we reversed and remanded because the circuit\ncourt had not followed the procedures required bych. 785 as a conditionprecedent\nto imposing remedial sanctions, Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ,-r,-r24-25, we concluded\nthat all of the sanctions already imposed, except the return of the guardian ad\nlitem's attorney fees, were authorized by ch. 785, Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ,-r,-r26 \n29. We did not separately analyze recovery of the lost interest and the attorney\nfees incurred by the subsequent guardian ad litem (to obtain belated compliance by\nthe attorneywiththe original court order) as each ofthose financial sanctions were\ncompensation to the victims for injuries suffered in the past, were necessary to\nremedy the injury directly caused by the attorney's violation of the court order,\nand thus all were compensable under WIS. STAT. §785.04. Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d\n596, ,-r27. We noted, by contrast, that return of the attorney fees earned by the\nguardian ad litem as counsel for the minors, which sum had been previously\nspecifically approved and authorized by the court's order, did not represent\n\"compensation of the minors for losses stemming from [the attorney's] failure to\ncomply with other provisions of the orders.\" [d., ,-r28. Based on § 785.04, we\ndirected that:\nOn remand, after notice and a hearing, if the court\nfinds that [the attorney] intentionally disobeyed its orders\nregarding disposition ofthe minors' settlement proceeds, it\nmay impose monetary sanctions pursuant to WIS. STAT.\n§785.04(1). These may include, under § 785.04(1)(a),\nrequiring [the attorney] to compensate the minors for their\nlosses suffered as aresult ofher contemptandrequiringher\nto pay the costs ofprocuring the restoration ofthe minors'\nfunds. If the court deems additional monetary sanctions\nnecessary or appropriate, such sanctions must be tied to the\npurposes setforth in paragraphs §785.04(1)(c)-(e).\nLuebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ,-r30.\n13\n\nNo. 2006AP803\n~19 The sanctions we approved in Luebke-return ofthe minors' money\n(which put the attorney in compliance with the face of the order), payment of\ninterest lost on that money, and payment ofattorney fees to a subsequent guardian\nad litem who pursued the victims' remedies for contempt-were authorized based\non the language of the statute and the intentional and continuing disobedience of\nthe court's order. That continuing disobedience, as in Frisch, caused injuries that\ncould not be undone merely by belated compliance with the order. Thus, as in\nFrisch, the injuries compensated in Luebke can also be understood as a form of\ncontinuing contemptbecause the noncompliance frustrates the basic purpose ofthe\noriginal order (to safeguard the minors' personal injury recovery) which could be\npurged onlyby requiring the contemnor to restore the victims ofthe contumacious\nconduct to the position in which they would have been had the contempt not\noccurred. Because of the prior holding in Luebke, we understand Frisch to be\nfurther explanation ofthe scope ofWIS. STAT. §785.04, rather than announcement\nofnew law.6\n6 See Kurtz v. City of Waukesha, 91 Wis. 2d 103, 108, 280 N.W.2d 757 (1979)\n(\"Retrospective application ofajudicialholding is aquestion ofpolicy, not constitutionallaw.\").\nThe explanationinFrisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, _ Wis. 2d_, 736 N.W.2d 85, ofWIS.\nSTAT. §785.04, is a judicial holding rather than application of a new statute. See Mosing v.\nHagen, 33 Wis. 2d636, 642, 148N.W.2d 93 (1967) (holding that a statute, adopted by the court\nthrough its rulemaking authority, applied retroactively unless it affected a vested or contractual\nright orimposedanunreasonableburdenupontheparty attemptingto complywiththeprocedural\nrequirements).\nOrdinarily the announcement of a new \"judicial·holding\" is retroactive unless it\n\"establish[es] a new principle oflaw, eitherby overrulingclearpast precedent onwhich litigants\nmay have relied, or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly\nforeshadowed,\" andretroactive application will eitherfurther orretard the policyannounced, and\nwill \"producesubstantialinequitable results.\" TrinityPetroleum, Inc. v. Scott OilCo., 2007 WI\n88,~77, 302Wis. 2d299,735 N.W.2d 1(footnote andcitationsomitted).\n14\n\nNo. 2006AP803\n~20 Our supreme court decided Frisch on July 17, 2007, well after the\ntrial court ruled and briefing in this appeal was complete. As in Luebke, the court\nin Frisch dealt with damages to the victim of contempt that were not, and could\nnot be, undone by belated compliance with the relevant order. Both parties\nsubmitted supplemental statements7 advising this court of their views of the\nimpact of Frisch on this case. Plaintiffs argued that Frisch clarifies both\n\"continuing contempt\" and the application ofremedial contempt under WIS. STAT.\nch. 785 by authorizing compensation to contempt victims, even though the\ncontempt has ceased by the time the compensation is considered, if the harm\ncaused by the original violation is not undone by ending the contemptuous action.\nBecause Frisch clarifies that if the harm is continuing, the statutes permit the\npurge condition to be the same as the sanction, plaintiffs argue that those harmed\nby the contempt should be compensated by a financial sanction which would\npurge the continuing nature ofthe harm earlier inflicted.\n~21 The County argues that Frisch is both legally and factually\ndistinguishable, but not that the principles discussed may not be applied here. The\nCounty argues that Frisch does not affect the outcome here because: Frisch must\nbe limited to the unique context offamily law child support obligations; unlike in\nFrisch, there is no continuing contempt in this case as the parties agree the thirty \nhour rule violations ceased as ofJune 2005, before plaintiffs moved for a finding\n7 These supplemental statements were submitted under the authority of WIS. STAT.\n§809.19(10). Th'e submissions of both parties have been considered and were helpful to the\ncourt.\nIS\"\n\nNo. 2006APS03\nof contempt; and the victims of the contempt here have not \"lost their traditional\nremedy,\"S and thus no compensationis necessaryto purge the contempt.\n~22 The County had been put on notice ofproblems in the booking area\nin December 2002 and January 2003, based on complaints from sheriffs deputies,\nbrought to the County Board Judiciary Committee, about unsafe working\nconditions in the booking area because ofovercrowding. The record also reflects,\nand the trial court noted, that violations continued after March 23, 2004, when\nplaintiffs requested discovery on the subject of violations ofthe Consent Decree.\nIt was not until June 2005,9 over fifteen months after the requested discovery was\nunderway, but before plaintiffs filed the motion for a finding of contempt and\nsanctions on September 13, 2004, that the County complied with the terms ofthe\n200I Consent Decree.\n~23 As the trial court noted, the standard for intentional misconduct in\nthe contempt context discussed inShepard, 189 Wis. 2d at 287, was met here. See\nalso Gower v. Circuit Court/or Marinette County, 154 Wis. 2d 1,452 N.W.2d\n354 (1990). Because ofthe County's violations, inmates in the booking area were\nforced to endure a variety of unsafe and unsanitary conditions because of\novercrowding which were specifically prohibitedby the Consent Decree. The trial\n8 The \"traditional remedy\" to which the County refers is apparently a separate civil\naction, eitherstateorfederal, for compensatorydamagesby each individual whowas subjectedto\nthe conditions created by the County's violation of the terms of the Consent Decree. Such a\n\"traditionalremedy\" wouldencourageapartyto ignore obligations ofaconsentdecree ifthe only\npracticalremedywasnumerous individuallawsuitsbyallvictims oftheviolations. Wefail to see\nhow that \"traditional remedy\" is either fair to the individual inmates who are class members\nharmedby the County's actions here, orhow such would be an efficientuse ofjudicialresources,\nparticularly when the remedy of contempt has no such obstacles to enforcement ofthe court's\norder.\n9 Thepartiesagreedthattheviolations ofthe thirty-hourrule endedinJune 2005.\n16\n\nNo. 2006AP803\ncourt graphically described these violations as including, among other things,\nforcing inmates to sleep on the floor next to urinals, bug-infested cells, bodily\nfluids on the floors, and bad odors. See ~5, supra. As we have seen, when the\npurpose ofthe court's order has been thwarted for a substantial period oftime by\nnoncompliance, and the victim(s) ofthe noncompliance have suffered unremedied\ninjuryas a direct result ofthat noncompliance, a remedial sanction is not limitedto\nbelated technical compliance with the face of the court's order. Frisch, 736\nN.W.2d 85, ~~54, 63, 64; Luebke, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ~~27, 30; Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d\nat 685; Griffin, 141 Wis. 2dat 708.\n~24 We remand this case to the trial court to determine, in light of this\ndecision and WIS. STAT. § 785.04, the \"sum ofmoney sufficient to compensate\"\nthe inmates held in violation of the Consent Decree for the \"loss or injury\nsuffered,\" and such further proceedings consistent with this opinion as may be\nappropriate. Our resolution is based on the available contempt sanctions;\ntherefore, we do not discuss the breach ofcontract claims as they are unnecessary\nto resolution of this appeal. See State v, Blalock, 150 Wis.2d 688, 703, 442\nN.W.2d 514 (CL App. 1989) (Cases should be decided on the narrowest possible\ngrounds.).\nBy the Court.-Order reversed and cause remanded with directions.\nRecommended for publicationin the official reports.\n17\n\nNo. 2006AP803(C)\n~25 FINE, 1. (concurring). I agree with the Majority's result and most\nof its opinion. In my view, the clear language of the statute, which the Majority\nquotes in ~ll, governs. Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, ~ Wis. 2d~, 736\nN.W.2d 85, as the Majority also notes in passing before its discussion in ~19 n.6,\nofwhether it should be applied retroactively, changed nothing. Under WIS. STAT.\n§ 785.04(l)(a)'s forthright and unambiguous directive, the plaintiffs are entitled to\nbe compensated for the losses and injuries they sufferedas a result ofMilwaukee's\nclearand blatant contempt.\n\n",

Sullivan, 2008 \nWI App 18, 307 Wis. 2d 754, 746 N.W.2d 553. \n¶2  The  decision  reversed  a  2006  order  of  the  Milwaukee \nCounty  Circuit  Court,  Clare  L.  Fiorenza,  Judge,  denying  the \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nplaintiffs' motion for monetary damages as a remedial sanction \nfor  the  defendants'  repeated  violations  of  a  Consent  Decree \ninvolving  the  Milwaukee  County  Jail  (the  Jail).    The  Consent \nDecree was approved by the circuit court in 2001.  Although the \ncircuit  court  found  that  the  defendants  were  in  contempt  of \ncourt,  it  declined  to  impose  monetary  damages  as  a  remedial \nsanction or for breach of contract.  When the court of appeals \nreversed, it remanded the case to the circuit court instructing \nit to determine the sum of money sufficient to compensate the \ninmates at the Jail who were held in violation of the Consent \nDecree. \n¶3  The  first  issue  presented  in  this  class  action  is \nwhether the circuit court was required to order monetary damages \nfor certain members of the class who were inmates at the Jail \nbetween  2001  and  2004  as  a  remedial  sanction  against  the \ndefendants for their repeated violations of the Consent Decree, \nwhen  there  is  no  dispute  that  \"the  violations  ha[d]  ceased.\"  \nThe  second  issue  is  whether  the  aforementioned  inmates  are \nentitled to monetary damages for emotional distress based upon \nbreach of contract, i.e., breach of the Consent Decree. \n¶4  We conclude, based on the facts of this case, that the \ncircuit  court  had  no  discretion  to  impose  a  remedial  sanction \nagainst the defendants after their contempt of court had ceased.  \nRemedial sanctions are \"imposed for the purpose of terminating a \ncontinuing contempt of court.\"  Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) (2007-08)1 \n                                                 \n1 All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to \nthe 2007-08 version unless otherwise indicated. \n2 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n(emphasis added).  Punitive sanctions may be \"imposed to punish \na  past  contempt  of  court.\"    Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(2)  (emphasis \nadded).    Because  breaches  of  the  Consent  Decree  had  ceased \nbefore the action for contempt was filed, the circuit court was \ncorrect  in  refusing  to  impose  a  remedial  sanction  against  the \ndefendants  for  their  past  contempt.    For  multiple  reasons,  we \nalso  conclude  that  the  plaintiff  class  is  not  entitled  to \nmonetary  damages  for  emotional  distress  for  breaches  of  the \nConsent  Decree.    Consequently,  we  reverse  the  decision  of  the \ncourt of appeals. \nI. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  ¶5  The material facts related to this appeal are not in \ndispute.    On  March  12,  1996,  Milton  J.  Christensen \n(Christensen), an inmate in the Jail, filed a handwritten, pro \nse  writ  of  prohibition  alleging  constitutional  violations \nstemming from substandard and dangerous conditions in the Jail.  \nAmong the specific conditions complained of were the following: \ndangerous overcrowding in the Jail; sharing of single-occupancy \ncells  with  other  inmates;  insufficient  time  outside  the  cell; \nand  exposure  to  communicable  diseases  due  to  inadequate \nscreening of new inmates.  At the time of filing, Christensen \nhad been held at the Jail as a pre-trial detainee for more than \na year. \n  ¶6  On  May  8,  1996,  the  Milwaukee  County  Circuit  Court, \nMichael Skwierawski, Judge, appointed the Legal Aid Society of \nMilwaukee, Inc. (Legal Aid) to represent Christensen.  On July \n25,  1996,  with  the  assistance  of  counsel,  Christensen  amended \n3 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nhis complaint in an effort to bring a class action \"on behalf of \nall persons who are now or in the future will be confined in the \nMilwaukee  County  Jail.\"    The  amended  complaint  alleged \nconstitutional  violations  at  the  Jail  for  substandard \nconditions. \n  ¶7  The  amended  complaint  alleged  that  the  Jail's \nconditions caused the infliction of needless pain and suffering \nand created a threat to inmates' mental and physical well-being.  \nThe  class  sought  relief  \"from  conditions  that  fall  below \ncontemporary standards of human decency, deny basic human needs, \ninflict  needless  pain  and  suffering,  and  threaten  plaintiffs' \nphysical and mental well-being.\" \n  ¶8  According  to  the  amended  complaint,  when  the  Jail \nopened  in  1993,  it  was  designed  to  hold  798  inmates.    This \nincluded  54  disciplinary  and  medical  beds  designated  for \ntemporary or special use.  However, the average daily population \nin the Jail in 1995 was more than 1,200.  Paragraph 27 of the \namended complaint read as follows: \n  27.  The Jail is seriously overcrowded.  Although \nit is designed to hold a maximum of 798 inmates, the \npopulation  on  July  10,  1996  was  1304  inmates.    Of \nthese, 547 were in the Jail post-sentencing, arguably \nmaking  them  the  responsibility  of  the  State  of \nWisconsin.    Specifically,  there  were  260  with  parole \nor  probation  violations  and  other  charges,  62  with \nonly  parole  violations,  30  sentenced  felons,  88 \nawaiting  sentencing,  31  with  division  of  intensive \nsanctions  penalties,  7  state  correctional  center \ninmates, 44 awaiting transfer to the state, and 25 on \norders  to  produce  and  return.    On  the  other  hand, \nthere  were  757  there  who  are  the  county's \nresponsibility.    Specifically,  this  includes  427 \npretrial  felony,  236  pretrial  misdemeanor,  84 \n4 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nmisdemeanor  sentenced  and  10  municipal  commitments.  \nIf  the  population  of  the  Jail  were  reduced  by  the \nnumber of inmates who are the State's responsibility, \nthe Jail would not be overcrowded.  The annual average \ndaily  population  in  the  Jail  was  over  1200  in  1995; \nand the monthly average daily population in June, 1996 \nwas 1222. \n¶9  Paragraph 28 continued with the following: \n  28.  As  a  result  of  the  high  population  of \ninmates, two inmates are confined to cells built for \none.  The second inmate is routinely forced to sleep \non  a  mattress  on  the  floor  because  each  cell  is \nequipped with only one bed.  Because the mattress on \nthe  floor  is  so  close  to  the  toilet,  the  toilet \n\"sweats\" and water spills or urine splashes from the \ntoilet  onto  the  floor  and  gets  the  mattresses  and \nbedding wet.  For most inmates, there are no pillows \nfor  persons  sleeping  on  the  floor  and  there  is  only \none blanket even when it is cold in the Jail. \n¶10  The  amended  complaint  pointed  to  the  special  problem \nof women in the Jail.  Women were serving misdemeanor sentences \nin the Jail, and women also were held in the Jail for violations \nof  probation  or  parole  because  there  were  no  alternative \nfacilities,  such  as  the  House  of  Corrections.    In  addition, \ninmates lacked sufficient access to adequate mental health care, \nmedical  care,  and  dental  care,  and  women  specifically  lacked \nequal access to educational and job-training opportunities. \n  ¶11  Defendants  included  the  Secretary  of  the  Wisconsin \nDepartment  of  Corrections,  the  Milwaukee  County  Sheriff,  and \nMilwaukee County (collectively referred to as \"the County\").   \n¶12  On  October  15,  1996,  the  class  was  certified  by  the \nMilwaukee  County  Circuit  Court,  Jacqueline  D.  Schellinger, \nJudge.    It  included  \"all  individuals  who  are  now  or  in  the \nfuture will be confined in the Milwaukee County Jail . . . and \n5 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nall such confined individuals who are now or in the future will \nbe subject to the policies and practices of Defendants.\" \n  ¶13  After  several  years  of  motions,  discovery,  and \nnegotiation,  the  parties  submitted  a  settlement  agreement  (the \nConsent Decree) to the court for approval.  The circuit court, \nThomas  E.  Donegan,  Judge,  held  hearings  and  on  May  29,  2001, \napproved the 48-page Consent Decree. \n¶14  At  the  hearings  on  the  Consent  Decree,  the  parties \nmade  clear  that  the  suit  was  about  injunctive  and  declaratory \nrelief, not damages.  Plaintiffs' counsel stated the following: \n\"[T]he relief applies to all inmates.  There are no damages.\" \n  ¶15  The  Consent  Decree  addressed  two  broad  issues: \novercrowding  and  medical  services  provided  to  inmates.    The \novercrowding section set a cap on the total population of the \nJail at 1,100, limited the number of inmates in the booking–open \nwaiting  area  (the  BKOW)  to  110,  and  stipulated  that  no \nindividual would remain in the BKOW longer than 30 hours.  The \n\"Medical  Services\"  section  included  provisions  to  improve \nmedical and mental health screenings conducted on new inmates, \ndecreased the wait time for sick inmates to receive a physical \nexamination,  improved  the  medication  distribution  system, \ndeveloped a mental health program, and increased staffing levels \nof mental health professionals. \n  ¶16  At  issue  in  this  case  are  the  provisions  addressing \nthe  inmates'  length  of  stay  in  the  BKOW.    The  relevant \nprovisions of the Consent Decree read as follows: \n6 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n  C.  As  of  3/21/01,  and  thereafter,  no  jail \ninmate shall be required to sleep on a mattress on the \njail floor or on the jail floor.  There shall be no \ninmate  in  the  jail  for  longer  than  thirty  hours \nwithout  being  assigned  to  a  bed  approved  by \nregulations of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections \nfor overnight housing (see ¶D, next following). \n  D.  Best  efforts  shall  be  made  to  assure  that \nthere will be no more than 110 inmates in booking at \nthe midnight count.  If the number exceeds 110, there \nshall be a plan for adequate emergency staffing in the \nbooking  room.    The  plan  shall  limit  the  number  of \ninmates  in  the  locked  rooms  surrounding  the  open \nwaiting area in the booking room and shall specify how \noften  those  side  rooms  are  checked.    The  maximum \npermanent population limit for the jail shall be 1100 \nat the midnight, \"11:59,\" count (according to the so-\ncalled  \"Daily  Census  Reports\").    The  1100  permanent \ncapacity limit on the jail assumes that there will be \na  reasonable  number  of  persons  held  on  a  short-term \nbasis in the booking area.  Since there are no beds in \nthe  booking  room,  a  number  of  inmates  may  be  placed \nthere  for  not  more  than  thirty  hours.    County \ndefendants  will  exercise  best  efforts  to  limit  any \ninmate's  stay  in  booking—open  waiting  to  twenty-four \nhours. \n(Emphasis added.) \n  ¶17  Following  court  approval  of  the  Consent  Decree,  the \nparties skirmished about attorney fees for Legal Aid.  On August \n27,  2001,  Judge  Donegan  awarded  attorney  fees  against  the \ndefendants  (except  the  Wisconsin  Department  of  Corrections).  \nThe court entered judgment on attorney fees on January 15, 2002.  \nThe  defendants  appealed  but  ultimately  sought  a  voluntary \ndismissal.    Defendants  satisfied  the  judgment  on  January  22, \n2003. \n7 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n  ¶18  The  circuit  court,  Clare  Fiorenza,  Judge,  held  a \nstatus  conference  on  November  25,  2003.    The  court  then \nadjourned the matter until May 27, 2004. \n  ¶19  On  March  23,  2004,  plaintiffs  moved  to  conduct \ndiscovery.    On  April  1,  2004,  the  Principal  Assistant \nCorporation Counsel, John Schapekahm, objected to discovery and \nfiled a lengthy affidavit, which is described infra at ¶25.  On \nApril  6,  2004,  the  court  conducted  a  motion  hearing  and  then \nauthorized plaintiffs to conduct discovery. \n  ¶20  The  court  held  a  new  status  conference  on  June  2, \n2004, and scheduled a tour of the Jail for June 21. \n  ¶21  Another status conference was held on July 13, 2004.  \nThe  docket  entry  reads  in  part:  \"Court  met  with  counsel  in \nchambers,  off  the  record.    Matter  then  called  on  the  record.  \nMatter  here  for  a  status  conference.  Plaintiff  to  file  a \ncontempt  motion  for  violation  that  occurred  prior  to  4/28/04.  \nThere have been no new violations since that date.\"  (Emphasis \nadded.) \n  ¶22  On  September  13,  2004,  the  plaintiff  class  filed  a \nmotion alleging that the County had breached the Consent Decree, \nspecifically  the  30-Hour  Rule,  by  holding  more  than  13,000 \ninmates  in  the  BKOW  for  over  30  hours.    The  plaintiff  class \nrequested  both  contempt-of-court  and  breach-of-contract \nremedies. \n¶23  On  November  15,  2004,  the  circuit  court,  Jeffrey \nKremers,  Judge,  found  that  the  defendants  had  violated  the \nConsent  Decree  and  authorized  the  plaintiff  class  to  conduct \n8 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \ndiscovery  to  determine  whether  they  were  entitled  to  either \ncontempt or contract remedies, or both. \n  ¶24  Discovery uncovered a large number of violations, but \nthe  parties  disagreed  about  what  caused  the  violations  and \nwhether  the  defendants'  attempts  to  comply  with  the  Consent \nDecree were made in good faith.  The plaintiff class reported \nthat,  between  November  2001  and  April  2004,  the  County  had \nviolated the 30-Hour Rule on 16,662 occasions.  At least 4,811 \ninmates  were  held  in  the  BKOW  for  more  than  two  days,  719 \ninmates were held for more than three days, and 39 inmates were \nheld for more than 100 hours. \n  ¶25  In  his  affidavit  of  April  1,  2004,  Assistant \nCorporation  Counsel  Schapekahm  had  claimed  that  the  Consent \nDecree  called  for  substantial  compliance  by  the  County \ndefendants as well as semi-annual reports on compliance from the \nplaintiffs.  He claimed that the plaintiffs had failed to file \nthese reports.  In response, the plaintiffs submitted a detailed \n18-page  letter  alleging  that  booking  room  violations  were  not \ndisclosed  to  them  and  were  \"in  fact  denied  and  otherwise \nobscured  for  months  in  which  the  plaintiffs  were  seeking \ninformation  about  this  problem.\"    According  to  the  letter, \ndefendants  did  not  provide  month-by-month  breakdowns  of  the \nnumber of 30-Hour Rule violations until early April 2004.  The \nJune 2 letter added the following: \"For the past four weeks that \ndefendants have been giving weekly reports of the over-30-hour \nviolations[,] the number has been zero for each of those four \nweeks.\"  (Emphasis added.) \n9 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n  ¶26  The County asserted that it made good faith efforts to \ncomply with the Consent Decree.  In a letter to the court, dated \nJuly 12, 2004, Attorney Schapekahm explained that the violations \nwere  the  result  of  breakdowns  in  communications  among \nadministrators  and  were  not  intentional.    He  stated  that \n\"I . . . can  testify  to  the  shock  written  across  the \nadministrators' faces when the gravity of the situation became \napparent.\" \n  ¶27  The defendants blamed general overcrowding in the Jail \nas a primary cause of the 30-Hour Rule violations.  According to \nDeputy  Inspector  Jerianne  Feiten,  who  was  largely  responsible \nfor overseeing the Jail from late 2002 to early 2004: \"Orally or \nin  writing,  everyday  it  was  reinforced  that  we  would  do——make \nevery  feasible  attempt  possible to  reduce  facility  population.  \nBy  reducing  facility  population,  that  would  open  up  beds \nupstairs to which those beds would be filled from the booking \nroom . . . .\"  The defendants emphasized, however, that reducing \nfacility population was largely out of their control because the \npolice  and  the  courts  controlled  the  number  of  inmates \npopulating  the  Jail.    The  Jail  population  was  a  function  of \narrests,  sentencings,  court  dates,  and  other  factors  not \ncontrolled by the defendants. \n  ¶28  The defendants explained that, if the permanent cells \nin the Jail were full, they had no place to move BKOW inmates.  \nAs  a  result,  the  BKOW  population  increased,  and  with  it,  the \namount of time inmates stayed in the BKOW.  Thus, the defendants \nmaintained  that,  despite  their substantial  compliance  with  the \n10 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nConsent Decree as a whole, their \"best efforts,\" and an increase \nin the County's funding of the Jail from $42.5 million in 2001 \nto $53.7 million in 2004, they violated the Consent Decree due \nto circumstances beyond their control. \n  ¶29  The defendants also attributed 30-Hour Rule violations \nto the Jail's \"objective housing classification system\" used to \nplace  inmates  in  permanent  cells.    The  Jail  examined  criteria \nsuch  as  age,  gender,  prior  criminal  history,  pending  or \nsentenced  charges,  escape  history,  institutional  disciplinary \nhistory,  alcohol  or  drug  abuse  history,  and  various  stability \nfactors to ensure the safety of inmates and staff.  While this \nsystem served important interests, the defendants said it also \nslowed the process of placing BKOW inmates in permanent cells.  \nFurthermore, because some inmates could not be placed together——\nbecause of gang affiliation, gender, pending charges, or other \nfactors——not  every  permanent  bed  in  the  facility  could  be \nutilized and that exacerbated the BKOW population problem. \n  ¶30  Despite the various circumstances contributing to the \n30-Hour  Rule  violations,  the  County  quickly  remedied  the \nsituation after the plaintiffs forced the issue in April 2004.  \nNo 30-Hour Rule violations have been documented since May 2004.  \nThis fact is notable, defendants claimed, considering that the \nCounty voluntarily imposed a stricter population cap on itself \nthan was required by the Consent Decree.  Defendants said that \napproval of funding in April 2004 to open a new dormitory in the \nHouse of Corrections was critical to easing population pressures \nin the Jail. \n11 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n  ¶31  The plaintiff class took a sharply different view of \nthe County's violations.  In a letter to the circuit court on \nAugust 25, 2004, the plaintiffs asserted the following:  \n \nThe problems were well known in the [J]ail throughout \nmany  months  in  which  the  plaintiffs  were  expressly \nasking  for  the  booking  information  and  during  which \nthe  defendants  provided  misleading  and  false \ninformation.  The problem did not just \"come to light\" \nin  April  2004  simply  because  upper  level  officials \nclaim to be unaware of the conditions and practices in \ntheir jail. \nThe  plaintiffs  later  pointed  to  the  depositions  of  several \nadministrators  who  admitted  to  knowing  about  the  30-Hour  Rule \nprovisions  of  the  Consent  Decree  and  that  it  was  not  being \nfollowed. \n  ¶32  The plaintiffs cited the existence of a 72-hour shower \nlist as evidence that 30-Hour Rule violations were well-known.  \nBKOW guards maintained a list that kept track of the number of \nhours each inmate had been held in the BKOW.  Any inmate held in \nthe BKOW for 72 hours was to receive a shower.  The existence of \nsuch a list, the plaintiffs said, should have raised red flags \nregarding 30-Hour Rule violations. \n  ¶33  The  plaintiffs  further  contended  that  the  County \nintentionally  hid  the  BKOW  population  limit  violations.  \nInterviews with inmates affected by the 30-Hour Rule violations \nand analysis of BKOW logs revealed that inmates were often moved \nout of the BKOW to other temporary locations in the Jail shortly \nbefore  the  nightly  \"11:59  P.M.\"  count.    The  purpose  of  these \ntemporary moves was purportedly to reduce the inmate population \n12 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nin  the  BKOW  artificially  in  order  to  comply  with  the  BKOW \npopulation cap imposed by the Consent Decree. \n  ¶34  In  response  to  these  opposing  views,  Judge  Fiorenza \nmade  various  findings  about  the  County's  compliance  with  the \nConsent Decree: \nMilwaukee County was put on notice of problems in the \nbooking area in December of 2002 and January of 2003 \nwhen  the  County  Board  Judiciary  Committee  was forced \nto respond to complaints from Sheriffs' Deputies that \novercrowding  in  the  booking  area  was  creating  unsafe \nworking  conditions . . . .    Moreover,  conditions  in \nthe  [BKOW]  area  alleged  by  members  of  the  Plaintiff \nclass  are  unacceptable,  if  not  appalling . . . \n[including] overly  crowded  conditions,  inmates  who \nwere  forced  to  sit  or  sleep  on  the  floor  next  to \nurinals,  inmates  who  had  to  sit-up  for  hours  and \nhours, lack of hygiene, unsanitary conditions, inmates \nwho  were  not  given  pillows  or  blankets  to  sleep  on, \ncells that were infested with bugs, cold temperatures, \nbodily fluids on the floor and bad odors. \n¶35  The  circuit  court  found  that  the  \"staggering\"  number \nof  violations  and  extended  period  of  time  during  which  the \nviolations occurred were clear evidence that the violations were \n\"intentional.\"  The County did not dispute these findings.  Also \nundisputed  was  the  court's  finding  that  \"the  thirty-hour \nviolations  ceased  immediately  after  the  Plaintiffs  filed  this \nmotion\" to enforce their rights under the Consent Decree. \n  ¶36  In January 2006, the circuit court declared that the \nCounty's  intentional  violations  of  the  Consent  Decree \nconstituted  contempt  of  court.    However,  the  circuit  court \ndeclined  the  plaintiffs'  request  to  award  money  damages  as \nremedial sanctions to \"members of the plaintiff class who were \nsubjected to violations of the [C]onsent [D]ecree.\"  The court \n13 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nsaid  that,  because  remedial  sanctions  are  \"imposed  for  the \npurpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court,\"  Wis. \nStat.  § 785.01(3),  and  because  it  was  undisputed  that  the \nCounty's violations had ceased, remedial sanctions could not be \nimposed. \n  ¶37  The  court  rejected  the  argument  that  it  could \ncircumvent  the  legislature's  regulation  of  the  contempt  power \nand  exercise  its  inherent  contempt  power  to  force  a  party  to \ncomply  with  a  court  order.    The  court  stated,  \"Because  the \nstatutory  language  is  clear,  the  Court  will  not  exercise  its \ninherent powers to impose sanctions.\" \n  ¶38  The  court  then considered  whether  breach  of  contract \nremedies  were  available  to  the  plaintiff  class.    The  circuit \ncourt  found  that  the  County's  actions  constituted  a  breach  of \nthe  Consent  Decree.    However,  although  both  sides  agreed  that \n\"contract law applies in interpreting the terms of the Consent \nDecree,\"  the  court  held  that  monetary  damages  for  the  breach \nwere  not  warranted  because  the  Consent  Decree  did  not  mention \nmoney  damages  as  a  remedy  for  a  violation.    Furthermore,  the \nplaintiff  class  did  not  initiate  its  suit  seeking  monetary \ndamages,  and  the  class  was  certified  for  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief only. \n  ¶39  The  plaintiffs  appealed,  and  the  court  of  appeals \nreversed on the issue of remedial sanctions.  The court did not \naddress the breach of contract issue.  In analyzing the circuit \ncourt's reliance on the contempt statute, the court of appeals \nstated that: \n14 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n[section]  785.04(1)(a),  specifically  authorizes \npayment of money to compensate a victim for an \"injury \nsuffered by the party as the  result  of  a  contempt  of \ncourt.\"  Use of the past tense in the statute plainly \nauthorizes  payment  for  injuries  that  occurred in  the \npast.    The  legislature  apparently  recognized  that \nbringing  a  party  into  compliance  with  a  court  order \ndid  not  necessarily  cure  the  harm  the  victim  of  the \nnoncompliance  had  already  sustained  because  of  the \nviolation of the court order.   \nChristensen,  307  Wis. 2d 754,  ¶12.    The  court  of  appeals  also \nrelied on this court's decision in Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI \n102,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  736  N.W.2d 85,2  to  determine  that  the \ndefendants' contempt was \"continuing\" for purposes of Wis. Stat. \nch. 785, and therefore, remedial sanctions could be awarded:  \n[W]hen  the  purpose  of  the  court's  order  has  been \nthwarted  for  a  substantial  period  of  time  by \nnoncompliance, and the victim(s) of the noncompliance \nhave suffered unremedied injury as a direct result of \nthat noncompliance, a remedial sanction is not limited \nto belated technical compliance with the face of the \ncourt's order. \nChristensen, 307 Wis. 2d 754, ¶23.  \n  ¶40  The court of appeals remanded the case to the circuit \ncourt instructing it to determine a \"sum of money sufficient to \ncompensate the inmates held in violation of the Consent Decree \nfor the loss or injury suffered.\"  Id., ¶24 (internal quotations \nomitted).    Because  it  found  remedial  sanctions  to  be  an \nappropriate  remedy,  the  court  of  appeals  did  not  reach  the \nquestion  of  whether  money  damages  for  breach  of  the  Consent \nDecree could be awarded. Id. \n                                                 \n2 Frisch  v.  Henrichs,  2007  WI  102,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  736 \nN.W.2d 85,  was  decided  after  the  circuit  court's  decision \nrejecting remedial sanctions. \n15 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n  ¶41  The County petitioned this court for review, which we \ngranted on May 13, 2008. \nII. Standard of Review \n¶42  The  issues  presented  in  this  appeal  are  reviewed  de \nnovo.    First,  to  determine  whether  the  circuit  court  had  the \nstatutory authority under Wis. Stat. ch. 785 to impose remedial \nsanctions against the County for its contemptuous conduct, even \nthough  the  contemptuous  conduct  had  ceased  at  the  time  the \nplaintiff  class  initiated  the  contempt  proceedings,  requires \nthis court to interpret and apply statutes.3  The interpretation \n                                                 \n3 The  plaintiff  class  requests  that  we  also  consider  the \ncircuit court's inherent authority to impose remedial sanctions.  \nAlso, the dissent advocates, as an alternative to its proposed \nstatutory  interpretation,  that  the  circuit  court  can  \"protect \nenforcement  of  its  orders\"  by  utilizing  its  inherent  powers.  \nDissent,  ¶¶134-136.    We  decline,  however,  to  delve  into  the \ncourt's inherent contempt authority because the legislature has \nenacted reasonable regulations and limitations upon courts' use \nof  the  contempt  power.    See  Frisch,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  ¶¶32-33, \n(\"The  legislature  has  regulated  contempt  in  Wis.  Stat.  ch. \n785.\");  Douglas  County  v.

Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶29. \n¶43  Second,  determining  whether  the  County's  admitted \nviolations of the Consent Decree entitle the plaintiff class to \nmonetary  damages  requires  the  court  to  interpret  the  Consent \nDecree as it relates to damages for breach.  The interpretation \nof a written agreement between two parties is a question of law \nthat we review de novo.  Columbia Propane, L.P. v. Wis. Gas Co., \n2003 WI 38, ¶12, 261 Wis. 2d 70, 661 N.W.2d 776; Klein v.

We do not consider the legislature's regulation \nof the contempt power to have rendered the circuit court's power \nimpotent  or  meaningless  in  this  case,  especially  given  the \ncircuit  court's  ability  to  appoint  a  special  prosecutor  to \npursue punitive sanctions.  See Wis. Stat. § 785.03(1)(b).  \n17 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n \nIII. Discussion \n¶44  The  defendants  assert  that  the  circuit  court  was \ncorrect in determining that it did not have authority to impose \na  remedial  sanction  against  the  County  for  contempt  of  court.  \nThe circuit court reasoned that it could not impose a remedial \nsanction  because  the  contempt  of  court——namely,  the  County's \nviolations of the 30-Hour Rule component of the Consent Decree——\nhad  ended  before  the  plaintiff  class  filed  its  motion  for \ncontempt, and only a continuing contempt warrants imposition of \na  remedial  sanction.    The  circuit  court  concluded  that  a \ncontinuing contempt of court is a prerequisite to the imposition \nof a remedial sanction under Wis. Stat. ch. 785. \n¶45  The  plaintiff  class  responds  that  the  circuit  court \ndoes  have  statutory  authority  to  impose  the  remedial  sanction \n\"of a sum of money sufficient to compensate a party for a loss \nor injury suffered,\" even when contemptuous behavior has ceased \nand  is  no  longer  continuing.    See  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.04(1)(a).  \nSpecifically, the plaintiff class postulates the following: \nChapter 785, when read as a whole and in light of its \nlegislative  intent,  history  and  purpose,  gives  the \ntrial  court  discretion  to  impose  remedial  sanctions \nfor any contempt of court that has caused a party to \nsuffer loss or injury, and to regard the contempt as \n\"continuing\"  so  long  as  the  loss  or  injury  goes \nunremedied.  \n¶46  The  plaintiff  class  does  not  assert  that  remedial \nsanctions must be imposed when a loss or injury goes unremedied; \nit argues only that the circuit court has discretion to impose \n18 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nthem  in  such  circumstances.    Thus,  according  to  the  plaintiff \nclass,  the  circuit  court  erred  in  failing  to  exercise  its \ndiscretion because it did not recognize its statutory authority \nto  impose  a  remedial  sanction  after  a  contempt  of  court  has \nterminated.  We disagree. \n¶47  Determining  whether  the  circuit  court  has  discretion \nto impose a remedial sanction against the County for its past \ncontempt  requires  us  to  interpret  the  statutes  found  in \nWisconsin  Statute  Chapter  785.    \"[S]tatutory  interpretation \nbegins with the language of the statute.  If the meaning of the \nstatute  is  plain,  we  ordinarily  stop  the  inquiry.    Statutory \nlanguage  is  given  its  common,  ordinary,  and  accepted  meaning, \nexcept that technical or specially-defined words or phrases are \ngiven their technical or special definitional meaning.\"  State \nex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane County, 2004 WI 58, ¶45, \n271  Wis. 2d 633,  681  N.W.2d 110  (internal  quotations  and \ncitations omitted).  Moreover, \"[i]n construing or interpreting \na statute the court is not at liberty to disregard the plain, \nclear words of the statute.\"  Id., ¶46 (internal quotations and \ncitation omitted).   \nA.  Wisconsin Contempt Law  \n¶48  We begin our analysis by focusing on the provisions of \nWis.  Stat.  ch.  785,  which  codifies  the  law  on  \"Contempt  of \nCourt.\"  Wisconsin Stat. § 785.01(1) defines \"contempt of court\" \nas intentional: \n(a)  Misconduct  in  the  presence  of  the  court \nwhich interferes with a court proceeding or with the \n19 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nadministration  of  justice,  or  which  impairs  the \nrespect due the court; \n(b)  Disobedience,  resistance  or  obstruction  of \nthe authority, process or order of a court; \n(bm) Violation of any provision of s. 767.117(1); \n(c)  Refusal as a witness to appear, be sworn or \nanswer a question; or \n(d)  Refusal  to  produce  a  record,  document  or \nother object. \n¶49  Wisconsin  Stat.  § 785.02  provides  that  a  court  of \nrecord \"may impose a remedial or punitive sanction for contempt \nof court under this chapter.\"  The terms \"remedial sanction\" and \n\"punitive  sanction\"  are  defined  in  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01  as \nfollows:  \n  (2)  \"Punitive sanction\" means a sanction imposed \nto punish a past contempt of court for the purpose of \nupholding the authority of the court. \n  (3)  \"Remedial sanction\" means a sanction imposed \nfor  the  purpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt \nof court. \n¶50  As  noted,  in  Wisconsin,  contempt  sanctions  are \nclassified  as  either  punitive  or  remedial.4    See  Wis.  Stat. \n                                                 \n4 Prior  to  1979,  Wisconsin  contempt  law  distinguished \nbetween  two  types  of  contempt——criminal  and  civil——rather  than \nbetween  two  types  of  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  for  any \ncontempt of court.  See Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶33 n.15; Note, \n§ 11,  ch.  257,  Laws  of  1979,  at  1353-54.    Rather  than  be \nconcerned over the type of contempt at issue, the \"statute now \ndraws a distinction based on the purpose of the sanction sought \nto be imposed.\"  Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶33 n.15.   \n \n\"Traditionally,  a  remedial  sanction  was  the  type  of \nsanction  imposed  for  civil  contempt.    The  purpose  of  the \nsanction was remedial in that it was designed to force a person \ninto  complying  with  an  order  of  the  court  and  terminating  a \n20 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n§ 785.04.  \"The remedies authorized by statute are the exclusive \nremedies  available . . . .\"    State  ex  rel.  N.A.  v.  G.S.,  156 \nWis. 2d 338,  341,  456  N.W.2d 867  (Ct.  App.  1990).    The \n\"imposition of either a punitive or a remedial sanction does not \npreclude imposition of the other type of sanction.\"  Robert J. \nMartineau, Contempt of Court: Eliminating the Confusion Between \nCivil and Criminal Contempt, 50 U. Cin. L. Rev. 677, 704 (1981) \n(interpreting  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.04(3)  and  acknowledging  that  a \npunitive sanction may be imposed for past conduct which was a \ncontempt  of  court  even  though  similar  present  conduct  is  a \ncontinuing contempt of court).  However, \"punitive sanctions may \n                                                                                                                                                             \npresent contempt of court.\"  Note, § 11, ch. 257, Laws of 1979, \nat 1355.  Today, \"[t]hat concept is continued here, even though \nwithout  the  civil  contempt  designation.\"    Id.    On  the  other \nhand,  \"[u]nder  prior  law,  criminal  contempt  involved  sanctions \nimposed on past conduct designed to vindicate the authority of \nthe  court.    Again  here,  the  concept  is  retained  in  the \ndefinition of punitive sanction . . . .\"  Id. \n \nTherefore, because \"[t]he distinction between the purposes \nof the contempt is retained in the current statute without the \ncriminal  and  civil  contempt  designations,\"  D.L.D.  v.  Circuit \nCourt for Crawford County, 110 Wis. 2d 168, 179, 327 N.W.2d 682 \n(1983), case law interpreting pre-1979 contempt statutes may be \nused  as  persuasive  authority  when  interpreting  the  present \ncontempt statutes, see, e.g., Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶35 (citing \nState  v.  King,  82  Wis. 2d 124,  262  N.W.2d 80  (1978),  with \napproval), State ex rel. Larsen v.

See \nGriffin  v.  Reeve,  141  Wis. 2d 699,  706,  416  N.W.2d 612  (1987) \n(\"[Chapter]  785 . . . substantially  restates  the  law  of \ncontempt.\").   \n21 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nnot  be  imposed  in  remedial  sanction  proceedings.\"    N.A.,  156 \nWis. 2d at 341. \n¶51  Punitive  sanctions  are  \"imposed  to  punish  a  past \ncontempt of court for the purpose of upholding the authority of \nthe court.\"  Wis. Stat. § 785.01(2) (emphasis added).  As the \ndefinition  implies,  punitive  sanctions  are  to  be  imposed  for \n\"past contempt of court\" only.  Id. (emphasis added); Wis. Stat. \n§ 785.04(3)  (\"A  punitive  sanction  may  be  imposed  for  past \nconduct . . . .\");    Frisch,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  ¶34  (quoting  Wis. \nStat. § 785.01(2)); Evans v.

Frisch, \n304  Wis. 2d 1,  ¶34;  Martineau,  supra,  at  694  (\"[B]ecause  the \nsanction is directed only at past conduct, its imposition cannot \ndirectly  aid  a  litigant  harmed  by  the  contempt.\");  see  also \n22 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nGriffin v.

See  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(2); Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶34; Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d at \n708; Evans, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ¶21; Diane K.J. v. James L.J., 196 \nWis. 2d 964,  969,  539  N.W.2d 703  (Ct.  App.  1995);  B.L.P.,  118 \nWis. 2d at  42;  Martineau,  supra,  at  694.    In  fact,  imposing \npunitive sanctions is much akin to imposing a criminal penalty, \nwhich is why the legislature has required that proceedings for \npunitive  sanctions  be  brought  exclusively  by  \"[t]he  district \nattorney  of  a  county,  the  attorney  general  or  a  special \nprosecutor  appointed  by  the  court\"  in  a  nonsummary  procedure.  \nWis. Stat. § 785.03(1)(b); see also D.L.D. v. Circuit Court for \nCrawford  County,  110  Wis. 2d 168,  179,  327  N.W.2d 682  (1983) \n(\"Traditionally,  a  punitive  sanction  was  imposed  for  criminal \ncontempt . . . .\"); Martineau, supra, at 693 (demonstrating the \ncommonality  between  the  current  statute's  definition  of \n23 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n\"punitive  sanction\"  and  the  previous  statute's  definition  of \n\"criminal contempt\"). \n¶54  Conversely,  remedial  sanctions  are  \"imposed  for  the \npurpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court.\"    Wis. \nStat. § 785.01(3) (emphasis added).  Logically, this means that \nremedial sanctions may be imposed only when action or inaction \nconstituting  contempt  of  court  is  ongoing  and  needs  to  be \nterminated.    Id.;  Note,  § 11,  ch.  257,  Laws  of  1979,  at  1355 \n(\"[A] remedial sanction is appropriate only when the contempt is \ncontinuing . . . .\")  (emphasis  added);  see  also  Frisch,  304 \nWis. 2d 1,  ¶¶4,  31  (imposing  remedial  sanction  for  continuing \ncontempt for failing to timely comply with a filing required by \ncourt  order,  thereby  depriving  the  opposing  party  of  her \ntraditional remedy under the law); Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d at 707-\n08 (continuing contempt and imposition of remedial sanctions for \nthe  father's  failure  to  pay  past-due  child  support  even  after \nthe child reaches the age of majority); Evans, 267 Wis. 2d 596, \n¶¶22,  27  (continuing  contempt  with  remedial  sanctions  imposed \nfor the guardian ad litem's ongoing failure to deposit funds as \nordered).    Without  a  continuing  contempt  of  court,  nothing \nremains  to  be  terminated,  and  thus,  a  remedial  sanction  is \nunwarranted.  See Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3); Note, § 11, ch. 257, \nLaws  of  1979,  at  1355  (\"[A]  remedial  sanction . . . cannot  be \nimposed if for any reason the contempt has ceased, even as the \nresult  of  the  settlement  of  the  case.\");  see  also  King,  82 \nWis. 2d at  131-32,  138  (disallowing  civil  contempt  proceedings \nunder  the  previous  contempt  statutes  after  the  underlying \n24 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \ndispute  settles);  17  Am.

See  Frisch,  304  Wis. 2d 1, \n¶35.  Rather, the stated and principal objective of a remedial \nsanction is to force the contemnor into compliance with a court \norder  for  the  benefit  of  a  private  party——the  litigant.

Martineau,  analyzing  Wisconsin's \nrecently  created  law  of  contempt  under  Wisconsin  Statutes \nChapter 785, made the following observation: \nArguably,  imposition  of  absolute  rather  than \nconditional  money  damages  as  a  remedial  sanction \nviolates the distinction between remedial and punitive \nsanctions  made  in  subsections  785.01(2)  and  (3) \nbecause the sanction is based upon past conduct and is \nnot designed to terminate a continuing contempt. \n28 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nStat. § 785.01(3) (\"'Remedial sanction' means a sanction imposed \nfor  the  purpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of \ncourt.\");  Note,  § 11,  ch.  257,  Laws  of  1979,  at  1355  (\"[A] \nremedial sanction . . . cannot be imposed if for any reason the \ncontempt has ceased, even as the result of the settlement of a \ncase.\") (emphasis added); see also King, 82 Wis. 2d at 131-32, \n138  (disallowing  civil  contempt  proceedings  under  the  previous \ncontempt statutes after the underlying dispute settles); 17 Am. \nJur. 2d Contempt § 145 (\"When the parties settle the underlying \ncase that gave rise to a civil contempt sanction, the contempt \nproceeding  is  moot,  since  the  case  has  come  to  an  end.\").  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nMartineau,  supra,  at  701-02.    Professor  Martineau  argues, \nhowever, that such an interpretation would be mistaken because \nimposition of absolute \"money damages for contempt\" can serve as \na remedial sanction.  Id. at 702.  Professor Martineau does not \ncite the Wisconsin contempt statutes to support this contention.  \nIn  fact,  he  offers  his  own  modification  to  the  definition  of \n\"remedial sanction\" under Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) to account for \nhis interpretation: \n  Of  course,  any  apparent  inconsistency  could  be \neliminated  by  modifying  Wis.  Stat.  Ann. \n§ 785.01(3) . . . to read as follows: \n(3)  \"Remedial  sanction\"  means  a  sanction \nimposed  for  the  purpose  of  terminating  a \ncontinuing contempt of court or of compensating a \nparty for loss or injury suffered as the result \nof a contempt of court. \nId.  at  702  n.147.    Quite  obviously,  Professor  Martineau's \nproposed  language  for  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3)  is  significantly \ndifferent  from  the  actual  language  in  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3).  \nAs  a  result,  Professor  Martineau's  discussion  lends  further \ncredence  to  the  conclusion  that  remedial  sanctions  can  be \nimposed only when the contempt continues.  \n29 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nPermitting the imposition of a remedial sanction in a situation \nwhere there is no continuing contempt would effectively rewrite \nthe statute.10  Therefore, the key to the issue in this case is \nwhether  the  County's  contempt  of  court  was  continuing  on  and \nafter the September 13, 2004 motion for a finding of contempt \nand imposition of remedial sanctions.   \n¶59  Chapter 785 does not define \"a continuing contempt of \ncourt.\"  If the court is required to interpret a statute and the \nwords in the statute are not defined, the court must apply the \nordinary meaning of the words to give effect to the statutory \nlanguage.  Kalal, 271 Wis. 2d 633, ¶45. \n¶60  The word \"continuing\" has many definitions.  However, \nwhen  using  \"continuing\"  in  the  context  of  determining  whether \nsomething has either been terminated or is ongoing, as in this \nstatute,  see  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3),  the  word  generally  means \n                                                 \n10 Wisconsin  Stat.  § 785.01(2)  defines  \"punitive  sanction\" \nas a \"sanction imposed to punish a past contempt of court for \nthe purpose of upholding the authority of the court.\"  (Emphasis \nadded.)  Admittedly, there is no difficulty in conceiving of a \nsanction  imposed  to  punish  a  past  contempt  of  court  for  the \npurpose of aiding a litigant.  One interpretation of Wis. Stat. \n§ 785.04(1)(a) is that payment of \"a sum of money sufficient to \ncompensate a party for a [past] loss or injury\" is that kind of \nsanction.    Wis.  Stat.  § 785.04(1)(a).    The  problem  with  this \nanalysis  is  that  trying  to  remedy  a  litigant's  past  loss  or \ninjury  by  means  of  a  remedial  sanction  deprives  the  party  in \ncontempt  of  the  protections  afforded  in  punitive  sanction \nprocedure  and  deprives  the  party  of  the  ability  to  purge  the \ncontempt by complying with a court order.  The statutory scheme \nestablishes two kinds of sanctions, each with specific criteria.  \nThere  may  be  a  void  in  this  statutory  scheme,  but  this  void \ncannot  be  filled  by  judicial  interpretation  without  doing \nviolence to the statutes. \n30 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \n\"[t]o  go  on  with  a  particular  action  or  in  a  particular \ncondition;  persist,\"    The  American  Heritage  Dictionary  of  the \nEnglish  Language  408  (3d  ed.  1992),  see  also  Black's  Law \nDictionary  316  (7th  ed.  1999)  (\"(Of  an  act  or  event)  that  is \nuninterrupted <a continuing offense>.\").   \n¶61  This definition of \"continuing\" is consistent with our \nprior  case  law  interpreting  whether  a  contempt  of  court  is \n\"continuing\" so that a remedial sanction may be imposed. \n¶62  For  instance,  one  obvious  example  of  a  continuing \ncontempt  justifying  a  remedial  sanction  is  where  a  parent  is \ndelinquent in paying child support.  See Larsen, 165 Wis. 2d at \n682,  685  (upholding  remedial  sanctions  and  purge  conditions \nimposed for the father's complete failure to pay child support \nas  ordered);  Griffin,  141  Wis. 2d at  700-01,  707-08  (holding \nremedial  sanctions  to  be  appropriate,  even  after  the  child \nreaches the age of majority, where the father has refused to pay \ncourt-ordered  support);  Benn,  230  Wis. 2d at  306-07,  315 \n(upholding  remedial  sanctions  and  purge  condition  for  the \nfather's repeated failure to pay child support as ordered).   \n¶63  In Griffin, the mother initiated contempt proceedings \nagainst the father, after the child reached the age of majority, \nfor his failure to make child support payments as required by \nthe divorce decree.  Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d at 701.11  The father \n                                                 \n11 In  this  case,  the  Wisconsin  Supreme  Court  overruled \nprevious  case  law  that  disallowed  the  enforcement  of  child \nsupport  orders  after  the  child  reached  the  age  of  majority.  \nGriffin,  141  Wis. 2d at  704  (overruling,  in  part,  Halmu  v. \nHalmu, 247 Wis. 124, 19 N.W.2d 317 (1945)). \n31 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \ndisputed the court's authority to impose a remedial sanction in \nthat  case,  arguing  that  his  contempt  could  no  longer  be \ncontinuing.    Id.  at  707.    His  theory  was  that  once  a  child \nreaches  the  age  of  majority,  \"the  parent's  duty  to  support \nceases,  and  a  delinquent  parent's  contempt  ends.\"    Id.    The \nfather contended that any sanction the court imposed against him \nfor  his  delinquent  child  support  payments  would  be  a  punitive \nsanction because his contempt had been terminated by the child's \n18th birthday and was no longer continuing.  Id. at 708.   \n¶64  In  response,  this  court  concluded  that  the  father's \ncontempt  was  continuing  because,  while  the  court  could  not \nmodify  or  terminate  the  support  order  after  the  child  reached \nmajority age, \"the force of the order does not expire until the \nparent complies.\"  Id.  In other words, \"A parent's failure to \npay  child  support  after  the  child  reaches  majority  is  a \ncontinuing disobedience of a court order.  The contempt is not \npast;  it  is  ongoing.\"    Id.  (emphasis  added).    Therefore,  the \ncourt  determined  that  the  circuit  court  did  have  authority  to \nimpose remedial sanctions against the father for his continuing \ncontempt of court.  Id. at 708-09.  \n¶65  A second example of a continuing contempt of court is \nfound  in  Evans.    There,  the  original  guardian  ad  litem, \nappointed  by  the  court  to  obtain  approval  of  settlement \nagreements  for  four  minors  in  two  personal  injury  lawsuits, \nfailed  to  deposit  the  settlement  awards  in  restrictive  trust \naccounts  as  ordered  by  the  circuit  court.    Evans,  267 \nWis. 2d 596,  ¶¶1  n.1,  4-5.    After  learning  of  the  original \n32 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nguardian ad litem's delinquency, the circuit court replaced her \nwith a new guardian ad litem who then moved the circuit court to \norder the original guardian ad litem to repay the missing funds.  \nId., ¶¶5-6.  Because the original guardian ad litem failed to \nrepay the funds as ordered, the circuit court entered judgment \nagainst  her  for  the  full  amount  of  the  funds  using  its  power \nunder Wis. Stat. § 805.03.12  See id., ¶¶8, 10.   \n¶66  In affirming the circuit court, the court of appeals \nmodified the circuit court's rationale by employing the contempt \nstatutes  rather  than  Wis.  Stat.  § 805.03.    Id.,  ¶  20  (\"[W]e \nconclude  that  the  circuit  court's  authority  to  sanction  [the \nguardian ad litem] for noncompliance with its substantive order \ndirecting the disposition of the minors' settlement proceeds is \nmore  firmly  grounded  in  Wis.  Stat.  ch.  785,  specifically  in \n§ 785.03(1)(a)  [(describing  procedure  for  remedial \nsanctions)].\").  The court of appeals concluded that the circuit \ncourt  had  actually  imposed  remedial  sanctions  in  the  case  but \ndid  not  follow  the  nonsummary  procedures  required  under  Wis. \nStat. § 785.03(1)(a).  Id., ¶¶22, 25.  Therefore, the court of \nappeals remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions \n                                                 \n12 Failure  to  prosecute  or  comply  with  procedure \nstatutes.  For failure of any claimant to prosecute or \nfor failure of any party to comply with the statutes \ngoverning  procedure  in  civil  actions  or  to  obey  any \norder  of  court,  the  court  in  which  the  action  is \npending may make such orders in regard to the failure \nas are just . . . . \nWis. Stat. § 805.03. \n33 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nto follow the procedures set forth in Wis. Stat. § 785.03(1)(a) \nand determine whether the original guardian ad litem's failure \nto  deposit  the  minors'  funds  as  ordered  was  intentional  and \ntherefore, qualified as contempt.  See id., ¶30.  The court of \nappeals  noted  that,  if  the  circuit  court  found  the  original \nguardian  ad  litem  in  contempt,  it  could  then  impose  monetary \nremedial  sanctions  because  the  contempt  would  be  continuing.13  \nId., ¶22 (\"So long as no properly restricted accounts containing \nthe  settlement  proceeds  existed,  [the]  alleged  contempt \ncontinued.\") (emphasis added). \n¶67  In  contrast,  the  most  obvious  case  of  a  contempt  of \ncourt  that  has  been  terminated  and  is  no  longer  continuing \noccurs when the underlying dispute between the parties has been \nsettled.    For  example,  in  King,  under  the  pre-1979  contempt \nstatutes, this court decided that the circuit court did not have \nthe  authority  to  conduct  civil  contempt  proceedings  after  the \n                                                 \n13 The court of appeals suggested what the monetary remedial \nsanctions should be if the circuit court found contempt:  \n[The  sanctions]  may  include,  under  § 785.04(1)(a), \nrequiring  [the  original  guardian  ad  litem]  to \ncompensate the minors for their losses suffered as a \nresult  of  her  contempt  and  requiring  her  to  pay  the \ncosts  of  procuring  the  restoration  of  the  minors' \nfunds.    If  the  court  deems  additional  monetary \nsanctions  necessary  or  appropriate,  such  sanctions \nmust be tied to the purposes set forth in paragraphs \n§ 785.04(1)(c)-(e). \nEvans,  267  Wis. 2d 596,  ¶30.    But  see  id.,  ¶28  (refusing  to \nvacate, as a remedial sanction, the original guardian ad litem's \nattorney  fees,  which  were  earned  by  negotiating  the \nsettlements).  \n34 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nprincipal action between the parties was settled and no longer \ncontinuing.  King, 82 Wis. 2d at 138.   \n¶68  King  was  an  opinion  dealing  with  violations  of  an \ninjunction that required certain state employees to refrain from \npicketing  and  other  strike-related  activities.    Id.  at  126.  \nThree  days  after  the  strike  was  settled  and  the  employees \nreturned to work, the Attorney General commenced civil contempt \nproceedings  against  those  state  employees  who  violated  the \ninjunction.  Id. at 127-28, 132.  After noting the distinctions \nbetween civil and criminal contempt,14 id. at 129-30, the supreme \ncourt  held  that  civil  contempt  proceedings  were  inappropriate \nunder  these  facts  because  the  strike  was  no  longer  continuing \nand  \"[t]he  only  purpose  for  a  contempt  action  brought  at  the \ntime the contempt was sought in these cases was punishment to \nvindicate the authority of the court,\" id. at 132.  The court \ndid state, however, that \"the acts complained of could have been \nthe  basis  for  criminal  contempt,\"  and  \"all  the  indicia  of \ncontempt point toward criminal contempt.\"  Id. at 131.  In fact, \n                                                 \n14 Civil contempt looks to the present and future and \nthe  civil  contemnor  holds  the  key  to  his  jail \nconfinement  by  compliance  with  the  order.    On  the \nother  hand,  the  criminal  contemnor  is  brought  to \naccount for a completed past action, his sentences are \nnot purgeable and are determinate.  Criminal contempt \nis  punitive.    It  is  not  intended  to  force  the \ncontemnor  to  do  anything  for  the  benefit  of  another \nparty. \nKing, 82 Wis. 2d at 130 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added); see \nalso,  supra,  ¶50  n.4  (explaining  the  relationship  between \ncriminal  and  civil  contempt  with  punitive  and  remedial \nsanctions, respectively). \n35 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nthe  court  explained,  \"These  cases  would  have  presented  no \nforeseeable  problems  if  they  had  been  brought  as  criminal \ncontempt.\"  Id. at 131-32.  \n¶69  The King court rejected the state's theory of a third \ncategory  of  contempt,  a  hybrid  approach  that  would  allow \npunitive sanctions in civil contempt.  Id. at 134.  Its decision \nwas  aided  by  the  legislature's  determination  to  \"no  longer \nrecognize[]  punitive  sanctions  for  civil  contempt\"  after  1975.  \nId.  at  134-35  (citing  Wis.  Stat.  § 295.02(5)  (1975-76)  (\"No \nperson may be imprisoned, nor required to pay any sum of money \nto  the  court  or  to  a  party,  under  this  chapter  except  as \nspecified  in  subs.  (1)  and  (2)  [(concerning  remedial  and \ncoercive sanctions but not punitive sanctions)].\")). \n¶70  The plaintiff class in this case relies on Frisch, a \ncase decided just two years ago by this court.  In Frisch, the \nunderlying  dispute  was  related  to  child  support  and  the \ndisclosure of the father's financial information.  Frisch, 304 \nWis. 2d 1, ¶6.  In particular, the divorce judgment between the \nfather and mother incorporated their settlement agreement, which \nrequired the father to provide the mother with a copy of his tax \nreturns  and  all  supporting  schedules.    Id.    The  required  tax \ninformation  would  permit  the  mother  to  monitor  the  father's \nfinancial  situation  and  to  seek  modifications  in  the  support \npayments  if  warranted.    Id.,  ¶4.    After  the  father  failed  to \ndisclose his tax returns, which would have shown a substantial \nincrease  in  income,  the  mother initiated  contempt  proceedings.  \nId.,  ¶7.    The  court  dismissed  the  contempt  proceedings  but \n36 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nrevised  the  father's  payment  schedule  and  reiterated  his \nfinancial  disclosure  obligations.    Id.,  ¶¶7-8.    This  time, \nhowever, the court ordered the father to make his tax returns \nand schedules available to the mother \"by May 12 of each year as \nlong as he had an ongoing child support obligation.\"  Id., ¶8.   \n¶71  After many months of court proceedings, the mother was \nforced to move for contempt again, alleging that the father had \nfailed to make the necessary financial disclosures.  Id., ¶12.  \nHowever, before a finding of contempt could be made, the father \ncomplied  with  the  financial  disclosure  order  and  produced  his \ntax  returns  for  the  mother.    Id.,  ¶¶14,  26.    Despite  the \nfather's belated attempt at compliance, the circuit court found \nhim  in  contempt  and  imposed  a  $100,000  sanction  against  him.  \nId.,  ¶23.    On  appeal,  the  court  of  appeals  concluded  that  a \nremedial  sanction  was  improperly  imposed  against  the  father \nbecause he had complied with the circuit court's order before it \nfound him in contempt.  Id., ¶26.  As the contempt was no longer \ncontinuing,  the  court  of  appeals  concluded,  the  circuit  court \nwas without authority to impose a remedial sanction against the \nfather.  Id. \n¶72  On review, this court reinstated the imposition of the \nremedial sanction against the father for his repeated failure to \nabide  by  the  court's  order  requiring  the  timely  disclosure  of \nhis  tax  return  information.    Id.,  ¶4.    The  sole  dispute  in \nrelation  to  the  contempt  issue  was  \"whether  remedial  contempt \nwas  properly  employed  in  this  case  because  [it  is]  dispute[d] \nwhether [the father's] contempt was continuing at the time the \n37 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \ncircuit court found [him] in contempt.\"  Id., ¶37; see also id., \n¶53  (\"[T]he  real  question  today  is  whether  the  contempt  is \ncontinuing.\").    The  court  answered  this  question  in  the \naffirmative.    Specifically,  this  court  stated  the  following \nabout the father's belated attempt at compliance and how it did \nnot suffice to terminate his contempt of court: \nAlthough  [the  father]  did  produce  all  the \nrequired documents before the circuit court found him \nin contempt, his contempt was continuing . . . because \nhis production of documents came too late to undo the \nproblems  he  had  created  by  failing  to  produce \ndocuments  on  time. . . .    Failure  to  timely  produce \nincome  information  'as  required'  was  really  the \nessence of [the father's] contempt because it shielded \nhim  from  exposure  to  regular,  contemporary  court-\nordered modifications of child support.  If [he] had \nsupplied the information timely, he would likely have \nbeen paying more support than he did.  By his repeated \nfailures,  [the  father]  deprived  [the  mother]  of  the \ninformation  necessary  to  seek  the  periodic \nmodification  of  support  she  was  entitled  to  request \nunder  the  law,  and  he  deprived  the  court  of  its \nauthority  to  timely  modify  its  child  support  order.  \nThe  contempt  was  continuing  because  [the  father's] \nfailure to comply with the court order deprived [the \nmother] of her ability to utilize traditional remedies \nin the law.   \nId., ¶47 (emphasis added).   \n¶73  In Frisch, the father paid all the child support that \nthe court had ordered.  See id., ¶23.  But he did not pay all \nthe child support he would have had to pay if he had complied \nwith the court's order by disclosing his tax returns by May 12 \nof each year.  Id., ¶23 n.10.  Timely disclosure was the essence \nof the order.  Id., ¶47.  Delinquent disclosure was ineffectual \nbecause  it  deprived  the  mother  of  her  traditional  remedies  in \n38 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nthe law, as the court was blocked by statute from retroactively \nmodifying the father's child support obligations.  Id.   \n¶74 In the present case, the circuit court found that the \nCounty had been in contempt of court, that is, the County had \nviolated the 30-Hour Rule component of the Consent Decree in the \npast.  But the court found, and the plaintiff class conceded, \nthat the 30-Hour Rule was not being violated in May, June, July, \nAugust, or September 2004, meaning that none of the members of \nthe  plaintiff  class  had  a  complaint  that  they  were  being \ndetained in violation of the 30-Hour Rule at the time the motion \nfor  contempt  was  filed.    In  short,  the  County's  contemptuous \nconduct was no longer continuing,15 and there is no suggestion \nthat  the  County  has  violated  any  part  of  the  Consent  Decree \n                                                 \n15 Under the statute, the key to whether the circuit court \nmay impose a remedial sanction is the word \"continuing.\"  The \ndissent  attempts  to  undercut  the  significance  of  the  word \n\"continuing\"  by  avoiding  the  past  tense  of  the  word,  namely, \n\"continued\" and instead using the past tense of the word \"is,\" \nnamely, \"was.\"  See dissent, ¶¶109-10 (\"[T]he County's contempt \nwas  continuing[,  i.e.,  it  continued]  for  almost  three  years.  \nWhy therefore does this case not present a case of continuing \ncontempt?\")  (emphasis  added).    However,  the  phrase  \"was \ncontinuing,\"  does  not  connote  the  same  meaning  as  the  word \n\"continuing.\"  To illustrate, the Thirty Years War continued or \n\"was continuing\" for 30 years, but the Thirty Years War is not \ncontinuing.    For  the  same  reason,  we  can  say  the  County's \ncontempt continued or \"was continuing\" for almost three years, \nbut the County's contempt is not continuing.   \n39 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nsince  April  2004.16    Thus,  we  are  left  with  the  question  of \nwhether  the  circuit  court,  under  these  circumstances,  had  the \nstatutory  authority  to  impose  a  remedial  sanction  of  any  sort \nagainst the County for its past contempt.  The answer to this \nquestion is \"No.\"   \n¶75  Because  the  County's  violation  of  the  Consent  Decree \nhad  indisputably  terminated  before  the  contempt  proceedings \nbegan,  there  is  no  way  we  can  justify  the  plaintiff  class's \nrequest  for  monetary  damages  on  grounds  of  \"a  continuing  [or \npersistent  or  uninterrupted]  contempt  of  court.\"    Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(3);  The  American  Heritage  Dictionary,  supra,  at  408; \nBlacks  Law  Dictionary,  supra,  at  316;  see  also  King,  82 \nWis. 2d at  132  (disallowing  the  maintenance  of  civil  contempt \nproceedings  because  the  contemptuous  conduct  was  terminated \nprior to the initiation of the contempt proceedings).  As the \nCounty's contempt was not continuing, the court could not impose \na  remedial  sanction  against  the  County  \"for  the  purpose  of \nterminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court.\"    Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(3); see also Note, § 11, ch. 257, Laws of 1979, at 1355 \n(\"[A] remedial sanction is appropriate only when the contempt is \n                                                 \n16 The  dissent  suggests  that  this  decision  permits  the \nCounty to resume violations of the Consent Decree without fear \nof penalty as long as the County ceases its violations before \nany party is able to file a motion for contempt.  See dissent, \n¶¶97, 111.  Although we do not decide this issue on hypothetical \nfacts not before us, we note that repeated violations of a court \norder  after  a  finding  of  contempt  may  constitute  a  continuing \ncontempt, and the circuit court has statutory authority to issue \nan \"order designed to ensure compliance with a prior order of \nthe court.\"  Wis.

In \nfact,  the  principal  objective  that  would  be  served  by  the \nimposition of a contempt sanction in this case now would be the \npunishment  of  the  County  and  the  vindication  of  the  circuit \ncourt's  authority——both  of  which  are  punitive  sanction \nobjectives.  See Wis. Stat. § 785.01(2); Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, \n¶34; Griffin, 141 Wis. 2d at 708; Evans, 267 Wis. 2d 596, ¶21; \nDiane  K.J.,  196  Wis. 2d at  969;  B.L.P.,  118  Wis. 2d at  42; \nMartineau, supra, at 694.   \n¶76  This is not a case where a contempt of court causes \nirreparable  harm  by  depriving  a  victim  of  her  \"ability  to \nutilize  traditional  remedies  in  the  law.\"    Frisch,  304 \nWis. 2d 1, ¶47.  For instance, the plaintiff class may be able \nto seek damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006).  With adequate \nproof, individual plaintiffs may be able to recover damages in \npersonal injury suits.17  The County's contempt of court cannot \nbe said to have deprived the plaintiff class of its \"traditional \nremedies  in  the  law,\"  and  consequently,  we  cannot  say  the \n                                                 \n17 In  a  significantly  different  fact  situation,  an \nappropriate authority may seek a punitive sanction and request \nthat  probation  be  imposed  upon  the  contemnor  in  place  of \nimprisonment,  and  then  seek  restitution  as  a  condition  of \nprobation.

Stat.  § 785.04(1)(a)  do  not \nexpressly  recognize  that  they  can  be  imposed  only  \"for  the \npurpose of terminating a continuing contempt of court\" does not \ncarry  the  day  for  the  plaintiff  class.    See  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(3).    All  the  sanctions  listed  under  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.04(1) carry the label of \"Remedial sanction.\"  \"Remedial \nsanction\" is a defined term that \"means a sanction imposed for \nthe  purpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court.\"  \nWis. Stat. § 785.01(3) (emphasis added).  Because the definition \nof  \"remedial  sanction\"  is  clear  on  its  face,  we  are  \"not  at \nliberty  to  disregard  the  plain,  clear  words  of  the  statute.\"  \nKalal,  271  Wis. 2d 633,  ¶46  (internal  quotations  and  citation \nomitted).    Therefore,  regardless  of  whether  all  the  remedial \nsanction  provisions  contained  in  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.04(1) \nexpressly  recognize  that  they  can  be  imposed  only  \"for  the \npurpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court,\"  Wis. \nStat. § 785.01(3), the fact that they are \"remedial sanction[s]\" \nand  the  definition  of  \"remedial  sanction\"  clearly  requires  a \ncontinuing contempt of court means that, to impose any sanction \n42 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nlisted under Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1), there must be a \"continuing \ncontempt of court,\" see Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3).18 \n¶78  Inasmuch as the County's contempt of court had ceased \nand  was  no  longer  continuing  at  the  time  the  contempt \nproceedings  were  initiated,  remedial  sanctions  could  not  be \nimposed.  Consequently, we affirm the circuit court's judgment \ndenying the plaintiff class remedial sanctions in this case. \nB.  Breach of the Consent Decree \n¶79  As an alternative to requesting monetary compensation \nas  a  remedial  sanction,  the  plaintiff  class  seeks  monetary \ndamages for breach of the Consent Decree.  The plaintiff class \nseeks  monetary  damages  for  emotional  distress  suffered  by \ninmates on account of the breach.  The circuit court denied this \nrequest,  primarily  on  grounds  that  \"[m]onetary  damages  for  a \n                                                 \n18 The dissent offers an alternative interpretation for the \ndefinition of remedial sanction under Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3): \"A \ncontempt is a continuing one and is not terminated as long as \nthe loss or injury to the victim of the contempt has not been \ncompensated.\"    Dissent,  ¶112.    First,  this  interpretation \neviscerates  the  distinction  between  remedial  and  punitive \nsanctions  found  in  Wis.  Stat.  ch.  785.    More  specifically, \nhowever, the dissent's interpretation would mean that a party's \ncontempt would not cease until remedial sanctions——better termed \n\"compensatory sanctions\" under such circumstances——were actually \nimposed.    According  to  that  interpretation,  two  outcomes  are \npossible:  (1)  the  circuit  court  would  be  required  to  impose \nremedial sanctions, thus depriving the court of its discretion \nunder Wis. Stat. § 785.02; or (2) the circuit court would refuse \nto impose remedial sanctions and the contemnor would remain in \ncontempt  of  court  indefinitely  because  \"the  victim  of  the \ncontempt  has  not  been  compensated.\"    Id.    Therefore,  the \ndissent's interpretation would not only ignore the definition of \n\"continuing\" but also would lead to absurd results. \n43 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nviolation of the Consent Decree are not even mentioned in the \nagreement.\" \n¶80  The  circuit  court  found  that  \"the  parties  did  not \nenter  into  the  Consent  Decree  with  the  expressed  intention  of \ncreating  the  opportunity  for  the  award  of  damages . . . .  \n[Moreover,  t]he  class  action  complaint  was  filed  seeking \ndeclaratory  judgment  or  injunctive  relief.    Nowhere  in  the \ncomplaint are monetary damages requested or mentioned.\"  \n¶81  The circuit court quoted the plaintiffs' trial counsel \nthree  different  times  as  saying  that  the  case  was  not  about \ndamages.  The court said that monetary damages for breach of the \nConsent  Decree  \"are  inappropriate  by  the  very  terms  of  the \nagreement  and  by  the  nature  of  the  pleadings  of  this  action.  \nThe  court  will  not  exercise  its  equitable  powers  to  award \nmonetary damages when the language of the Consent Decree clearly \ndoes not provide for them.\" \n¶82  Monetary damages were not the objective of this class \naction suit.  The original plaintiff, Christensen, filed a pro \nse writ of prohibition in March 1996.  In July 1996, Christensen \namended his complaint, with the assistance of counsel, to bring \na class action under Wis. Stat. § 803.08.  In October 1996, the \nclass  was  certified  by  Judge  Schellinger.    \"The  determination \nthat  a  class  action  is  appropriate  is  discretionary  with  the \ntrial  court.\"    Preloznik  v.  City  of  Madison,  113  Wis. 2d 112, \n125,  334  N.W.2d 580  (Ct.  App.  1983)  (citing  Mercury  Records \nProds.,  Inc.  v.  Econ.  Consultants,  Inc.,  91  Wis. 2d 482,  491, \n283 N.W.2d 613 (Ct. App. 1979)).  A party that radically alters \n44 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nits  position  after  it  has  successfully  invoked  a  court's \nexercise  of  discretion  should  anticipate  that  the  court  will \nbind the party to its prior position. \n¶83  In  May  2001,  Judge  Donegan  approved  the  48-page \nConsent  Decree.    Judge  Fiorenza  found  that  the  Consent  Decree \nwas  the  product  of  extensive  negotiation  among  the  parties.  \nThat  decree,  she  determined,  did  not  contemplate  monetary \ndamages.    \"Damages  in  breach  of  contract  cases  are  ordinarily \nmeasured  by  the  expectations  of  the  parties.\"    Handicapped \nChildren's Educ. Bd. v. Lukaszewski, 112 Wis. 2d 197, 206, 332 \nN.W.2d 774 (1983). \n¶84  Even  if  we  were  able  to  overlook  these  clear \ndeficiencies,  we  would  not  approve  monetary  damages  in  this \ncase.    The  plaintiff  class  claims  damage  \"for  humiliation, \nemotional distress, and mental anguish.\"  In essence, these are \ndamages in tort for a purported breach of contract. \n¶85  The  plaintiff  class  contends  that  the  County  could \nreasonably foresee that damage of this nature would result from \nholding prisoners for more than 30 hours without a bed and that \n\"[m]onetary  damages  are  the  most  effective  remedy  to  put  the \nvictims of this breach in the position they would have been in \nhad  the  settlement  agreement  not  been  breached . . . .\"    The \nplaintiff  class  points  to  Restatement  (Second)  of  Contracts \n§ 353  (1981),  \"Loss  Due  to  Emotional  Disturbance,\"  which \nprovides the following: \"Recovery for emotional disturbance will \nbe  excluded  unless  the  breach  also  caused  bodily  harm  or  the \n45 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \ncontract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional \ndisturbance was a particularly likely result.\"   \n¶86  Wisconsin  has  not  adopted  § 353  of  Restatement \n(Second) of Contracts.  On the contrary, the court has stated \nthat mental suffering, while recognized as an injury, \"has been \nheld not a proper element of recoverable damages in actions on \ncontract.\"    Koerber  v.  Patek,  123  Wis. 453,  464,  102  N.W.  40 \n(1905).    The  antiquity  of  the  cited  case  does  not  negate  the \nvalidity of the principle.  See Bourque v. Wausau Hosp. Ctr., \n145 Wis. 2d 589, 596 n.2, 427 N.W.2d 433 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing \nMursch  v.  Van  Dorn  Co.,  627  F.  Supp.  1310,  1317  (W.D.  Wis. \n1986)). \n¶87  Moreover,  even  if  we  adopted  § 353  of  Restatement \n(Second)  of  Contracts,  the  plaintiff  class  still  would  not  be \nable to recover for emotional distress.  In particular, Comment \na. to § 353 of Restatement (Second) of Contracts reads in part: \nDamages  for  emotional  disturbance  are  not  ordinarily \nallowed.  Even if they are foreseeable, they are often \nparticularly  difficult  to  establish  and  to  measure.  \nThere  are,  however,  two  exceptional  situations  where \nsuch  damages  are  recoverable.    In  the  first,  the \ndisturbance  accompanies  a  bodily  injury.    In  such \ncases the action may nearly always be regarded as one \nin tort . . . .  In the second exceptional situation, \nthe  contract  or  the  breach  is  of  such  a  kind  that \nserious  emotional  disturbance  was  a  particularly \nlikely  result. . . .   [I]f  the  contract  is  not  one \nwhere this was a particularly likely risk, there is no \nrecovery for such disturbance. \n(Emphasis  added.)    The  plaintiff  class  has  not  provided \nsufficient  evidence  of  compensable  injuries  to  overturn  the \ncircuit court's decision to deny the claim.  Cf. Pleasure Time, \n46 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nInc. v. Kuss, 78 Wis. 2d 373, 387, 254 N.W.2d 463 (1977) (\"[T]he \nburden rests on the [plaintiff] to prove by credible evidence to \na  reasonable  certainty  that  damages  were  suffered  and  to \nestablish  at  least  to  a  reasonable  probability  the  amount  of \nthese  damages.\").    The  plaintiff  class  has  also  failed  to \ndemonstrate that this contract \"is of such a kind that serious \nemotional  disturbance  was  a  particularly  likely  result.\"  \nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 353 cmt. a.  \n¶88  Although  we  acknowledge  that  some  members  of  the \nplaintiff  class  may  have  suffered  bodily  injury,  isolated \nincidents  of  bodily  injury,  even  if  proven,  are  nearly \ninevitable in a jail population of approximately 150,000 people \nover  the  period  of  three  years  (March  2001  to  April  2004).  \nGeneralized claims of such injuries do not support an award of \ncontract damages for widespread emotional disturbance among the \n16,000 members of the class. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n¶89  We conclude, based on the facts of this case, that the \ncircuit  court  had  no  discretion  to  impose  a  remedial  sanction \nagainst the defendants after their contempt of court had ceased.  \nRemedial sanctions are \"imposed for the purpose of terminating a \ncontinuing contempt of court.\"  Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) (emphasis \nadded).    Punitive  sanctions  may  be  \"imposed  to  punish  a  past \ncontempt  of  court.\"    Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(2)  (emphasis  added).  \nBecause  breaches  of  the  Consent  Decree  had  ceased  before  the \naction for contempt was filed, the circuit court was correct in \nrefusing  to  impose  a  remedial  sanction  against  the  defendants \n47 \n \n\nNo.    2006AP803 \n \nfor their past contempt.  For multiple reasons, we also conclude \nthat the plaintiff class is not entitled to monetary damages for \nemotional  distress  for  breaches  of  the  Consent  Decree.  \nConsequently, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals. \nBy  the  Court.—The  decision  of  the  court  of  appeals  is \nreversed. \n \n \n48 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \n¶90  SHIRLEY S. ABRAHAMSON, C.J.   (dissenting).  This case \ninvolves the civil rights of individuals who were arrested and \nconfined  in  the  booking  area  of  the  Milwaukee  County  jail.  \nThese arrested persons (not convicted of any crime and presumed \ninnocent) alleged (without direct contradiction) that they were \nheld for more than 30 hours awaiting booking, crowded into cold \ncells without blankets, sitting up or lying down on cell floors \nsplashed with bodily fluids, sleeping next to urinals, confined \nin  an  unsanitary  and  bug-infested  space.    The  circuit  court \nfound  that  thousands  of  inmates  were  held  in  these  conditions \nfor more than two days.  Hundreds were held for more than three \ndays.  Some were even held in excess of 100 hours.   \n¶91  You  do  not  see  these  substandard  and  dangerous \nconditions  on  TV  when  booking  is  portrayed.    But  these \nconditions  apparently  existed  right  here  in  Milwaukee, \nWisconsin.1   \n¶92  The Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, Inc., representing \nthese  arrestees,  sued  the  County  and  officials  (collectively \nreferred to as the County in the majority opinion and here) for \nmaintaining  such  conditions.    The  circuit  court  for  Milwaukee \nCounty entered an order, a Consent Decree, in which the County \nagreed to correct various conditions.  Under the Consent Decree \narrested  persons  could  be  kept  in  the  booking  area  (without \n                                                 \n1 The  circuit  court  found  the  government  officials  in \ncontempt  for  a  \"staggering\"  pattern  of  confining  thousands  of \npeople  in  the  jail's  booking  area  in  \"unacceptable,  if  not \nappalling\"  conditions  for  extended  periods  in  direct  violation \nof the explicit terms of the consent decrees. \n1 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nbeds) for not more than 30 hours.   At no time since the entry \nof the Consent Decree did the County seek relief from the decree \nbecause  the  requirements  proved  to  be  too  onerous  or \nimpractical.    Nevertheless  the  County  violated  the  Consent \nDecree for nearly three years.    \n¶93  The circuit court found that the County intentionally \nviolated the 30-hour provision of the court's Consent Decree on \n16,662 occasions over nearly a three-year period, November 2001 \nto April 2004, keeping inmates in the booking area longer than \n30 hours without assigning them to a bed.2  The County did not \nchallenge this finding in the court of appeals or in this court.   \n¶94  After the Legal Aid Society sought discovery in April \n2004  to  prove  violations  of  the  Consent  Decree,  the  County \nimmediately remedied the conditions and began obeying the court \norder.3  In July 2005  the Legal Aid Society asked the circuit \n                                                 \n2 Majority  op.,  ¶35:  \"The  circuit  court  found  that  the \n'staggering  number  of  violations  and  extended  period  of  time \nduring  which  the  violations  occurred  were  clear  evidence  that \nthe violations were 'intentional.'\"   \nNeither the court of appeals nor this court has been asked \nto review the circuit court's determination that the County was \nin  contempt  of  the  consent  decree.    Relevant  to  the  present \ncase, the contempt statute defines \"[c]ontempt of court\" to mean \n\"intentional . . . [d]isobedience,  resistance  or  obstruction  of \nthe  authority,  process  or  order  of  a  court.\"    Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(1)(intro)  &  (1)(b).    The  court  of  appeals  has  stated \nthat \"[a] finding of contempt rests on the trial court's factual \nfindings.  The critical findings are that the party was able to \ncomply with the order and that the refusal to comply was willful \nand with intent to avoid compliance.\"  Evans v.

The circuit court so held.   \n¶95  The  circuit  court  also  held  that  even  though  the \nCounty  intentionally  violated  the  court  order  and  was  in \ncontempt  of  court,  the  circuit  court  could  not  award  monetary \ndamages  under  chapter  785  of  the  statutes  as  a  remedial \nsanction.   \n¶96  The issue before this court, stated in general terms, \nis the power of a circuit court to ensure compliance with its \norders.  More specifically, the issue before this court is the \npower of a circuit court to ensure compliance with its order by \nawarding monetary damages for a party's intentional violation of \na court order that constitutes contempt of court. \n¶97  The  majority  opinion  holds  that  because  a  remedial \nsanction  is  statutorily  defined  as  \"a  sanction  imposed  for \npurposes  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court,\"  Wis. \nStat. § 785.01(3) (emphasis added), a circuit court is powerless \nto  impose  the  sanction  of  compensatory  damages  provided  in \n§ 785.04 (1)(a) \"when breaches of the Consent Decree had ceased \nbefore  the  action  for  contempt  was  filed.\"4    In  other  words, \nunder the majority opinion if the contempt of court lasts for \nnearly three years and ceases before the motion for contempt is \nfiled,  a  court  cannot  require  the  contemnor  to  pay  \"a  sum  of \nmoney  sufficient  to  compensate  a  party  for  loss  or  injury \nsuffered by the party as the result of a contempt of court\" as \nprovided  in  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.04(1)(a).    Thus  in  the  present \n                                                 \n4 Majority op., ¶4.  See also id., ¶¶74, 75. \n3 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \ncase, according to the majority opinion, the County can violate \nthe  circuit  court  order  without  penalty  for  two  and  one  half \nyears and may even be free to do so again so long as the County \nagain  stops  the  violations  before  a  motion  for  contempt  is \nfiled.5  \n¶98  I write separately, agreeing with the court of appeals \nthat  monetary  damages  are  permitted  under  the  statute  in  the \npresent case.  I would remand the cause to the circuit court to \ndetermine the sum of money, if any, sufficient to compensate the \npersons held in violation of the Consent Decree for the loss or \ninjury suffered.6 \n                                                 \n5 Without deciding the issue, the majority opinion suggests \nthat although the County was able to terminate its contempt of \ncourt  (and  preclude  the  use  of  remedial  sanctions)  by  ceasing \nits repeated violations of the court order before a motion for \ncontempt was filed, the County might be unable to do the same \nthing a second time.  See majority op., ¶74 n.16 (\"[R]epeated \nviolations  of  a  court  order  after  a  finding  of  contempt  may \nconstitute a continuing contempt . . . .\").  In other words, the \nmajority  opinion  suggests  that  under  the  contempt  statute  a \ncontemnor  has  one  freebie  opportunity——but  \"may\"  not  have  two \nfreebie opportunities——to repeatedly violate a court order with \nimpunity prior to a motion for contempt.   \nThe majority opinion also seems to imply that if the County \nresumes  violating  the  court  order  and  again  ceases  its \nviolations  before  a  motion  for  contempt  is  filed,  the  circuit \ncourt may exercise its authority under Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1)(d) \n\"to issue an 'order designed to ensure compliance with a prior \norder  of  the  court.'\"    Majority  op.,  ¶74  n.16  (quoting  Wis. \nStat.  § 785.04(1)(d)).    Section  785.04(1)(d),  however,  is  a \nremedial sanction and under the majority opinion's reasoning may \nnot be used except for the purpose of terminating a continuing \ncontempt of court.  \n6 The  circuit  court  concluded  as  a  matter  of  law  that \nremedial sanctions were not available under the circumstances of \nthe present case.  The circuit court therefore never determined \nwhat sum of money, if any, would be sufficient compensation.   \n4 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \n¶99  I reach this conclusion for several reasons.  First, \nthe  majority  opinion's  interpretation  of  the  phrase  \"remedial \nsanction\"  in  chapter  785  of  the  statutes  is  erroneous  as  a \nmatter of statutory interpretation.  The interpretation of the \nstatute  is  inconsistent  with  the  text  of  chapter  785  of  the \nStatutes, represents a sharp break from the traditional law of \ncontempt  in  Wisconsin,  is  contrary  to  the  statutory  and \nlegislative history, and produces an absurd result.  Two years \nago,  the  court  declared  that  \"the  intent  behind  the  contempt \nstatute . . . is  to  provide  the  court  with  a  mechanism,  or \ntoolbox, to effect compliance with court orders.\"7  Today, the \ncourt removes tools from the toolbox, tools that are needed to \neffect  compliance  with  court  orders,  and  eviscerates  the \nfunction  of  the  contempt  statute  and  the  circuit  court's \nauthority to enforce its own orders.  \n¶100 Second,  the  interpretation  contravenes  Frisch  v. \nHenrichs,  2007  WI  102,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  736  N.W.2d 85,  a  case \ndecided a mere two years ago.   \n¶101 Third, if chapter 785 is to be interpreted to create a \nvoid in a court's power to enforce an order through contempt, I \nconclude  that  a  circuit  court  may  award  compensatory  damages \nunder  its  inherent  powers  over  contempt  in  a  case  that  falls \ninto the statutory void.     \nI \n¶102 Chapter  785  has  to  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the \ntexts of Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) and § 784.04(1)(a), the context \n                                                 \n7 Frisch, 2007 WI 102, ¶82, 304 Wis. 2d 1, 736 N.W.2d 85. \n5 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nand  structure  of  the  chapter,  the  statutory  and  legislative \nhistory  of  the  chapter,  contempt  law  in  Wisconsin,  and  the \npurpose of the contempt statute.  \n¶103 Section 785.01(3) provides: \"'Remedial sanction' means \na sanction imposed for the purpose of terminating a continuing \ncontempt of court.\" \n¶104 Section  785.04(1)(a)  provides  in  relevant  part:  \"A \ncourt  may  impose  one  or  more  of  the  following  remedial \nsanctions:  (a)  Payment  of  a  sum  of  money  sufficient  to \ncompensate a party for a loss or injury suffered by the party as \nthe result of a contempt of court.\" \n¶105 A plain reading of Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1)(a) is that \nthe circuit court may order contemnors to compensate others for \nlosses or injuries suffered as a result of a contempt of court.   \nWisconsin Stat. § 785.04(1)(a) explicitly authorizes payment of \nmoney to compensate a victim \"for a loss or injury suffered by \nthe  party  as  the  result  of  a  contempt  of  court\"  (emphasis \nadded).    The  word  \"suffered\"  makes  sense  only  if  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.04(1)(a)  applies  to  payment  for  losses  or  injuries  that \nalready have occurred and that resulted from past conduct.   \n¶106 Relying on the \"clear language of the statute,\" Judge \nFine  wrote  in  his  concurring  opinion  in  the  court  of  appeals \ndecision in the present case: \"Under Wis. Stat. § 785.04(1)(a)'s \nforthright  and  unambiguous  directive,  the  plaintiffs  are \nentitled  to  be  compensated  for  the  losses  and  injuries  they \nsuffered as a result of Milwaukee's clear and blatant contempt.\"8 \n                                                 \n8 Christensen  v.

It states that \"[s]tanding alone, [Wis. Stat. \n§ 785.04(1)(a)]  could  be  interpreted  as  allowing  payment  of  a \nsum of money for a loss or injury suffered in the past . . . .\"9      \n¶108 The majority opinion nevertheless concludes that Wis. \nStat. § 785.04(1)(a) should not be interpreted according to its \nplain meaning, in light of Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3)'s definition \nof a remedial sanction as a sanction imposed for the purpose of \nterminating a \"continuing\" contempt.    \n¶109 The court therefore must determine the meaning of the \nstatutory  phrase  \"a  continuing  contempt.\"    This  phrase  is  not \ndefined in the statute.  The majority opinion concedes that the \nword \"continuing\" has many dictionary meanings and selects the \nmeaning \"to go on with a particular action.\"10  Of course, here \nthe County did \"go on with a particular action\" for nearly three \nyears. \n¶110 In ordinary, plain English, the County's contempt was \ncontinuing for almost three years.  Why therefore does this case \nnot present a case of continuing contempt?  Where in the statute \ndoes it say that the contempt has to continue after the motion \nfor contempt has been filed?

Stat.  § 785.01(3))  the  remedial \nsanction has to \"terminate a continuing contempt,\" and here the \nCounty \"terminated\" its own continuing contempt by obeying the \ncourt order.  \n¶111 The  majority  opinion's  reading  of  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.01(3) creates an unnecessary conflict between § 785.01(3) \nand  § 785.04(1)(a);  renders  meaningless  § 785.04(1)(a)'s \nspecific  grant  of  authority  to  a  court  to  award  compensatory \ndamages to those who have suffered a loss or injury as a result \nof  a  party's  contempt  of  court;  and  allows  the  contemnor  to  \nrepeatedly  violate  a  court  order  and  to  inflict  harm  without \nfear of being required to compensate its victims so long as the \ncontemnor  ceases  violations  before  a  motion  for  contempt  is \nfiled.   \n¶112 There is an alternative interpretation of the language \nin  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3)  defining  a  remedial  sanction  as  a \nsanction  \"imposed  for  the  purpose  of  terminating  a  continuing \ncontempt\": A contempt is a continuing one and is not terminated \nas long as the loss or injury to the victim of the contempt has \nnot  been  compensated.

Punitive sanctions are imposed for the \npurpose of punishment, do not involve compensation to a victim, \nand may be  imposed whether or not any harm to the victim has \nbeen remedied.  See Wis. Stat. § 785.01(2) (defining \"punitive \nsanction\" as a sanction \"imposed to punish a past contempt of \ncourt for the purpose of upholding the authority of the court\"); \nWis. Stat. § 785.04(2) (listing only fines and imprisonment as \nthe sanctions that a court may use for a punitive purpose).  \nNor does this interpretation eliminate a court's discretion \nto impose remedial sanctions.  Nothing in chapter 785 requires a \ncourt to impose a sanction in every instance that a party is in \ncontempt  of  court.    Section  785.02  states  that  \"[a]  court  of \nrecord may impose a remedial or punitive sanction for contempt \nof court under this chapter\" (emphasis added). \n12 See  Schroeder  v.

Every  version  of  the  Wisconsin  Statutes  from  1849 \nthrough  1977  stated  that  the  sanction  of  compensatory  damages \ncould be imposed in a civil contempt proceeding.16  No version of \nthe contempt statutes limited a court to using the sanction of \ncompensatory  damages  as  a  means  of  terminating  a  continuing \n                                                 \n15 A  court  may  determine  whether  to  impose  a  \"remedial\" \ncontempt sanction in an ordinary civil proceeding.  In contrast, \nwhen  determining  whether  to  impose  a  \"punitive\"  contempt \nsanction,  a  court  ordinarily  must  comply  with  the  statutes \ngoverning criminal procedure.  Compare Wis. Stat. § 785.03(1)(a) \n(stating  that  a  court  may  impose  a  remedial  contempt  sanction \nupon a motion from a party and after notice and a hearing) with \nWis. Stat. § 785.03(1)(b) (stating that when a punitive sanction \nis sought, the district attorney, attorney general, or a special \nprosecutor must issue a complaint charging the alleged contemnor \nwith  contempt  of  court  and  that  such  complaint  \"shall  be \nprocessed  under  chs.  967  to  973  [pertaining  to  matters  of \ncriminal procedure]\").   \n16 See, e.g., Wis. Stat. ch. 115, § 21 (1849) (\"If an actual \nloss or injury has been produced to any party by the misconduct \nalleged, the court shall order a sufficient sum to be paid by \nthe defendant to such party, to indemnify him and to satisfy his \ncosts  and  expenses . . . .\");  Wis.  Stat.  § 295.02(1)(a)  (1977) \n(\"If an actual loss or injury has been produced to any party by \nthe misconduct of the contemnor, which it is not efficacious to \nremedy  by  execution  or  garnishment,  the  court  may  order  the \ndefendant to pay such party a sum sufficient to compensate the \nparty for losses, costs and expenses . . . .\"). \nIn  1979,  prior  to  enacting  the  current  contempt  statute, \nthe  legislature  renumbered  chapter  295  of  the  statutes  as \nchapter 785.  See § 62, ch. 32, Laws of 1979. \n11 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \ncontempt of court.  Indeed, in 1906 this court stated that the \nstatutes  relating  to  civil  contempt  proceedings  sought  \"to \nindemnify parties to the action for their actual loss or injury\" \nas well as \"to compel the performance of duties still within the \ncontemnor's power.\"17 \n¶118 The  pre-1979  contempt  statutes  were  consistent  with \nthe  law  of  other  jurisdictions,  which  seem  uniformly  to \nrecognize that contempt sanctions in a civil contempt proceeding \nmay  be  imposed  either  for  the  purpose  of  terminating  a \ncontinuing contempt or for the purpose of compensating a party \nfor  losses  resulting  from  a  contempt  of  court.    The  United \nStates  Supreme  Court,  for  example,  has  stated  that  in  civil \ncontempt  proceedings,  sanctions  \"may,  in  a  proper  case,  be \nemployed  for  either  or  both  of  two  purposes:  to  coerce  the \ndefendant  into  compliance  with  the  court's  order,  and  to \ncompensate  the  complainant  for  losses  sustained.\"18    Numerous \n                                                 \n17 Emerson  v.

King,  82 \nWis. 2d 124, 262 N.W.2d 80 (1978).   \nKing  overruled  the  Emerson  decision  to  the  extent  that \nEmerson  permitted  \"imposition  of  punitive  sanctions  in  civil \ncontempt which have no remedial or coercive attributes.\"  King \n82 Wis. 2d at 134.  The sanction of compensatory damages is not \na  \"punitive\"  sanction.    Chapter  785  includes  the  sanction  of \ncompensatory  damages  in  its  list  of  \"remedial\"  sanctions  and \nomits it from the list of \"punitive\" sanctions.  See Wis.

Stat. \n§ 785.01(3)  reflects  the  legislature's  intent  to  diminish  the \ncourts' authority to impose compensation as a contempt sanction.  \nRather,  the  history  appears  to  show  that  the  Judicial  Council \nunderstood  the  1979  contempt  statute  as  leaving  the  courts' \ntraditional  powers  intact.    According  to  the  statutory  and \nlegislative history, Wis. Stat. § 785.01(3) must not be read as \nlimiting  Wis.  Stat.  § 784.04(1)(a)'s  provision  authorizing \ncompensation as a remedial contempt sanction.   \n¶124 In sum, as interpreted by the majority opinion, Wis. \nStat. § 785.01(3) leaves the Wisconsin courts unable to impose \nthe  remedial  contempt  sanction  of  compensation  except  for  the \npurpose  of  terminating  a  continuing  contempt  of  court  and \n\"terminating  a  continuing  contempt\"  is  narrowly  interpreted.  \nThis  limitation  on  a  court's  contempt  authority  did  not  exist \nbetween 1849 and 1979 in Wisconsin and does not appear to exist \nin  other  jurisdictions.

Elections  Bd.,  117  Wis. 2d 351,  356,  344  N.W.2d 117 \n(1984)  (\"It  is  inappropriate . . . for  a  court  to  rely  on  the \nstatements  of  a  member  of  the  legislature  as  to  what  the \nlegislature  intended  when  enacting  a  statute.\").    I  note, \nhowever, that the court has, in the past, relied upon private \ncommunications between a member of the legislative council staff \nand a single legislator as evidence of legislative intent.  See \nMaurin  v.  Hall,  2004  WI  100,  ¶¶77,  89,  274  Wis. 2d 28,  682 \nN.W.2d 866. \n17 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \ndid  not  intend  to  change  the  substantive  law  of  contempt \nsanctions  when  it  repealed  and  recreated  Chapter  785  in  1979.  \nThe  interpretation  of  chapter  785  adopted  by  the  majority \nopinion produces absurd results limiting the contempt power of a \ncourt.    For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  that  the  majority \nopinion's interpretation of the statute is erroneous. \nII \n¶125 Regardless of the correct interpretation of Wis. Stat. \n§ 785.01(3), I agree with the court of appeals that the County's \nflagrant violations of the court order represent \"a continuing \ncontempt\"  under  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3)  as  the  statute  was \ninterpreted  and  applied  by  this  court  in  Frisch  v.  Henrichs, \n2007  WI  102,  304  Wis. 2d 1,  736  N.W.2d 85.27    The  majority \nopinion significantly undercuts the Frisch decision.   \n¶126 The  Frisch  decision  teaches  that  when  a  party  is  in \ncontempt of the circuit court's order to perform actions by a \nspecified  time,  the  party  cannot  terminate  its  contempt  by \nperforming the required actions too late to undo its intentional \nviolation of the circuit court's command respecting timeliness.  \nThe  Frisch  lesson  applies  in  the  present  case,  and  under  the \n                                                 \n27 See  Christensen  v.  Sullivan,  2008  WI  App  18,  ¶1,  307 \nWis. 2d 754,  746  N.W.2d 553  (\"When  the  trial  court  concluded \nthat sanctions or compensation for continuing contempt were not \navailable because Milwaukee County (County) had ceased violating \nthe Consent Decree on which the trial court based its finding of \ncontempt,  it  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  our  supreme  court's \nholdings in Frisch v. Henrichs, 2007 WI 102, 304 Wis. 2d 1, 736 \nN.W.2d 85, decided in July 2007, while this appeal was pending. \nWe  conclude  that  the  remedy  of  sanctions  under  Wis.  Stat. \n§ 785.04  for  continuing  contempt,  as  described  in  Frisch,  is \napplicable to the contempt found by the trial court here.\"). \n18 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nreasoning  of  Frisch,  this  case  therefore  falls  within  chapter \n785's provisions relating to remedial contempt. \n¶127 In  Frisch,  a  circuit  court  order  required  an  ex-\nhusband to provide his ex-wife with certain tax information by \nMay 12 of each year.  At the time of the contempt hearing, the \nex-husband had complied with the circuit court's order insofar \nas it required him to provide the tax information to his ex-wife \nbut  had  not  complied  (and  no  longer  could  comply)  with  the \ncourt's  order  insofar  as  it  required  him  to  provide  the \ninformation  timely.    Furthermore,  the  ex-husband's  failure  to \nprovide the tax information timely had harmed the ex-wife in a \nway  that  the  ex-husband  could  not  cure  by  providing  the \ninformation  too  late  to  comply  with  the  circuit  court  order.  \nBecause  of  the  ex-husband's  conduct,  the  ex-wife  had  missed \nopportunities  to  seek  timely  modification  of  a  child  support \norder in her favor and likely had not received the full amount \nof child support to which she was entitled.       \n¶128 This court concluded, with Justice Prosser writing for \nthe majority, that the ex-husband's contempt was continuing at \nthe time of the contempt hearing because the husband could not \nundo  his  violation  of  the  circuit  court's  order  respecting \ntimeliness  and  was  in  continuing  violation  of  that  portion  of \nthe order.  The Frisch court stated that \"[t]he timely provision \nof information was an essential element of the [circuit] court's \norder.\"28    Furthermore,  the  husband's  \"[f]ailure  to  timely \n                                                 \n28 Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶4.   \n19 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nproduce income information 'as required' was really the essence \nof  [his]  contempt  because  it  shielded  him  from  exposure  to \nregular,  contemporary  court-ordered  modifications  of  child-\nsupport.\"29    Due  to  the  ex-husband's  contempt  of  the  circuit \ncourt's  order  respecting  timeliness,  \"full  compliance  with  the \ncourt's  order  [was]  impossible.\"30    The  Frisch  court  explained \nthat the husband \"could not and did not turn back time when he \nproduced the required information too late to be acted on[.]\"31   \n¶129 The contempt in the present case, like the contempt in \nFrisch,  consists  of  an  intentional  failure  to  perform  actions \ntimely as required by the circuit court's order.  The Consent \nDecree required the County to implement the 30-hour rule \"[a]s \nof  3/21/01,  and  thereafter[.]\"32    At  the  time  of  the  contempt \nhearing, the County had complied with the Consent Decree insofar \nas it required the County to implement the 30-hour rule but had \nnot  complied  (and  no  longer  could  comply)  with  the  Consent \nDecree insofar as it required the County to implement the 30-\nrule timely.  Furthermore, the County's failure to implement the \n30-hour rule timely harmed members of the plaintiff class in a \nway that the County could not cure by implementing the 30-hour \n                                                                                                                                                             \nSee  also  id.,  ¶47  (\"Producing  documents  was  only  part  of \nthe  court's  order.    Producing  documents  on  time . . . was  an \nequal part of the order.\").     \n29 Id.   \n30 Id., ¶62.   \n31 Id., ¶4.   \n32 Majority  op.,  ¶16  (emphasis  added;  quoting  the  Consent \nDecree).   \n20 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nrule too late to comply with the Consent Decree.  Because of the \nCounty's  conduct,  many  members  of  the  plaintiff  class  were \nforced to spend more than 30 hours in the County jail without a \nbed, contrary to the Consent Decree's explicit mandate.   \n¶130 The  Frisch  court's  reasoning  applies  cleanly  and \nclearly  to  the  facts  of  the  present  case.    The  County  cannot \nundo its violation of the Consent Decree's provision respecting \ntimelines and is in continuing violation of that portion of the \nConsent  Decree.    Timely  implementation  of  the  30-hour  rule \nunquestionably was an essential element of the Consent Decree.  \nDue  to  the  County's  contempt  of  the  circuit  court's  order \nrespecting  timeliness,  full  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree \nnow is impossible.  The County could not and did not turn back \ntime when it implemented the 30-hour rule too late to benefit \nthe many inmates who spent more than 30 hours in the County jail \nwithout a bed, contrary to the Consent Decree. \n¶131 The  only  obvious  difference  between  Frisch  and  the \npresent  case  that  might  seem  to  matter  under  the  majority \nopinion  relates  to  when  the  contumacious  conduct  stopped \nrelative  to  when  the  motion  for  contempt  sanctions  was  filed.  \nIn  Frisch  the  contemnor  began  complying  with  the  court  order \nafter the motion for contempt was filed (but before a finding of \ncontempt).    In  the  present  case  the  contemnor  began  complying \nwith  the  court  order  about  three  years  after  the  order  but \nmonths  before  a  motion  for  contempt  was  filed.    The  timing \nissue, however, was not even mentioned in Frisch and certainly \nwas not determinative.  \n21 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \n¶132 The  majority  opinion  seems  to  distinguish  Frisch  by \ndeclaring that \"[t]his is not a case where a contempt of court \ncauses irreparable harm by depriving a victim of her 'ability to \nutilize traditional remedies in the law.'\"33  Majority op., ¶76 \n(quoting Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶47).  Frisch, however, imposed \nno requirement that a contempt must deprive a plaintiff of any \nexisting remedy under the law in order to be \"continuing\" and to \ntrigger the possibility of compensatory sanctions.  Frisch did \nnot  hold  that  all  other  potential  avenues  of  relief  must  be \nexhausted  before  contempt  sanctions  are  used.    Indeed,  the \nFrisch court stated that remedial contempt was properly employed \nalthough  the  ex-wife  potentially  could  have  been  entitled  to \nrelief under Wis. Stat. § 806.07.34    \n¶133 The contempt statute offers no textual basis for the \nposition that whether a contempt is \"continuing\" for purposes of \nWis.  Stat.  § 783.01(3)  depends  on  whether  other  remedies  are \navailable to the victim of contempt.  The majority should not be \ndistinguishing  Frisch  by  rewriting  the  contempt  statute, \n                                                 \n33 Without explanation, reasoning, or citation to authority, \nthe majority cavalierly declares that the plaintiff class may be \nable  to  bring  a  42  U.S.C.  § 1983  action  for  damages  and  that \nindividual plaintiffs may file personal injury lawsuits. It is \nnot  clear  that  the  individual  members  of  the  class  may  bring \ntheir own actions for damages.  The majority opinion decides the \nissue  without  analyzing  claim  preclusion,  the  federal  Prisoner \nReform Litigation Act and its state progeny, or other practical \nbarriers to such suits.  As a practical matter and as a matter \nof judicial administration I do not think it a good idea for the \nmajority  opinion  to  encourage  16,662  individuals  to  file \nindividual actions or to suggest personal liability for public \nofficials in the present case. \n34 See Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶27 n.12. \n22 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nengrafting  a  requirement  onto  Wis.  Stat.  § 785.01(3)  that  is \nextrinsic to the statute and unsupported by the statute's text.  \nIII \n¶134 If the majority opinion's statutory interpretation is \naccepted,  the  result  is  that  a  circuit  court  has  no  power  to \nimpose remedial compensatory damages to sanction a contumacious \nparty for intentionally violating a court order for nearly three \nyears, a clear contempt of court, so long as the party ceases \nits contumacious behavior before a motion for contempt sanctions \nis filed.  Thus there is a void in the statute relating to a \ncircuit  court's  power  to  protect  enforcement  of  its  orders.  \nUnder such circumstances, the circuit court may use its inherent \npower to fill the void in the contempt statutes.35  Filling in a \nvoid in the statute does not contravene the statute.  \n¶135 \"A  court's  power  to  use  contempt  stems  from  the \ninherent  authority  of  the  court\"  and  a  court's  contempt  power \nmay not be \"rendered ineffectual\" by statute.36  A court's power \nof  contempt  exists  independently  of  and  outside  the  statutes; \ncourts have retained their inherent contempt power in addition \nto the statutory power prescribed by the legislature.37  When the \n                                                 \n35 As the majority opinion explains: \"The statutory scheme \nestablishes two kinds of sanctions, each with specific criteria.  \nThere may be a void in this statutory scheme . . . .\"  Majority \nop.,  ¶58  n.10.    The  majority  concludes  without  analysis  that \nthis  void  cannot  be  filled  by  judicial  interpretation  without \ndoing  violence  to  the  statutes.    Yet  the  majority  recognizes \nthat the statute does not deprive a court of its inherent powers \nto protect enforcement of its order.   \n36 Frisch, 304 Wis. 2d 1, ¶32. \n37 In  the  Interest  of  D.L.D.,  110  Wis. 2d 168,  178,  327 \nN.W.2d 682 (1983).  \n23 \n \n\nNo.  2006AP803.ssa \n \nprocedures and penalties for contempt are prescribed by statute, \nthe statute controls as long as the statute does not render the \ncourt's power impotent or meaningless.38  To the extent that the \nlegislature  unreasonably  burdens  or  substantially  interferes \nwith the contempt power of the judiciary, such interference with \nthe  courts'  power  to  enforce  their  orders  violates  the \nseparation of powers doctrine.39 \n¶136 \"The power to punish for contempts is inherent in all \ncourts; its existence is essential to the preservation of order \nin  judicial  proceedings,  and  to  the  enforcement  of  the \njudgments, orders, and writs of the courts, and consequently to \nthe due administration of justice.\"40  A court has an \"inherent \npower  to  protect  its  own  decrees  and  the  private  rights \nattendant on those decrees.\"41  Intentional defiance of a court's \njudgment or order cannot be condoned.  A party must be able to \nemploy  civil  contempt  proceedings  to  enforce  its  adjudicated \nrights.    I  therefore  conclude  that  when  a  contempt  has \nterminated  and  no  remedial  sanction  is  available  under \n                                                 \n38 Evans v.
