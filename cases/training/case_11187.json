          "description": " ENTRY CONCERNING SELECTED MATTERS - As a result of the hearing conducted on  March 18, 2016 and the parties' filings associated with the resolution of this  action through the submission and aproval of a Private Settlement Agreement,  the partie s' Stipulation [dkt 496] is approved. The Court's findings, also  issued this date, show that the proposed Private Settlement Agreement is \"fair, reasonable,  and adequate.\" Judicial policy favors voluntary settlement of  class-ac tion cases. Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir. 1977). That  policy is fully served by approval of the proposed Private Settlement  Agreement. Objections to the proposed Private Settlement Agreement are  overruled. By approving the Privat e Settlement Agreement, moreover, the  judgment will also provide for the dismissal of the action without prejudice  after a period of three years. Judgment consistent with the foregoing, with the Private Settlement Agreement  and with all other pertinent findings shall now issue.  Signed by Judge Tanya Walton Pratt on 3/24/2016.  (JLS)"

    "summary": "<p>On Oct. 1, 2008, the Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services Commission (IPAS) filed this lawsuit on behalf of a group of prisoners with serious mental illness in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. IPAS, represented by the ACLU, proceeded under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Indiana Department of Corrections (IDOC), asking the court for injunctive and declaratory relief.  IPAS alleged that IDOC failed to adequately treat the prisoners in non-segregated and therapeutic environments, as required by the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act.</p><p>Specifically, IPAS claimed that mentally ill prisoners were regularly held in isolation at multiple prisons throughout the state, and, for a number of them, the only contact they had with mental health staff was through brief conversations at their cell doors. The continued confinement of these mentally ill prisoners without adequate mental health care, IPAS argued, violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment. Additionally, by placing these prisoners in segregated and isolated confinement, the state discriminated against them in violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.</p><p>IPAS is an agency created by Indiana state law pursuant to the federal Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act. It is charged with advocating for and protecting the rights and interests of, among other parties, individuals with mental illness. IPAS claimed in its complaint that, because of its unique role in protecting the interests of mentally ill adults in Indiana, it has standing to bring suit on their behalf.</p><p>On December 15, 2008, IDOC filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing and jurisdiction; the state argued that IPAS's complaint presented only an \"intramural\" dispute between two state agencies, and should be resolved by the governor. On July 21, 2009, the court (Judge David F. Hamilton) denied IDOC's motion. It held that the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act empowered IPAS to sue on behalf of its mentally ill constituents; and the organization also satisfied the constitutional criteria for standing. The court also held that IPAS was not a traditional state agency and was independent of the governor.  642 F.Supp.2d 872.</p><p>On December 2, 2009, IPAS filed an amended complaint seeking class certification for all mentally ill prisoners in Indiana housed in settings that feature extended periods of isolation in cells. On April 27, 2010, the court (Magistrate Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson) granted IPAS's motion to certify the class. 2010 WL 1737821.</p><p>On July 25, 2011, after some discovery disputes (see 603 F.3d 365), a bench trial commenced before Judge Tanya Walton Pratt; it lasted five days. On December 31, 2012, the court filed an entry following the bench trial. It found that segregation harms mentally ill prisoners in three ways: (1) the lack of social interaction itself creates problems associated with isolation; (2) the isolation involves significant sensory deprivation; and (3) the enforced idleness exacerbates the prisoners' symptoms of serious mental illness.  The court went on to find that the mentally ill prisoners in IDOC segregation units do not receive minimally adequate mental health care and that IDOC has been deliberately indifferent regarding this care in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court then scheduled a conference with both parties to establish an appropriate remedy to the constitutional violation. 2012e WL 6738517.</p><p>From 2013-2016, the parties met to develop a plan for IDOC to remedy the constitutional violations found by the court. They entered status reports periodically throughout the years. </p><p>On January 2, 2016, the parties proposed a settlement agreement that prohibited, with some exceptions, the confinement of seriously mentally ill prisoners in restrictive status housing or protective custody (i.e., solitary confinement). As a general rule, no prisoner who was seriously mentally ill would be placed into restrictive housing. The agreement defined severe mental illness to include people who entered solitary with less than severe mental illnesses but whose mental health deteriorated due to solitary. And, the agreement provided for \"minimum adequate treatment\" for these prisoners. IDOC also agreed to pay $585,000 in attorneys' fees. The agreement would last for three years.</p><p>On March 24, 2016, Judge Pratt approved the settlement agreement finding that it was “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” The court was to retain jurisdiction over the case for three years at the conclusion of which the case will be dismissed without prejudice. </p><p>On October 16, 2018, a class member filed a motion to order contempt of court, alleging that IDOC failed to comply with the settlement agreement. On October 18, 2018, Judge Pratt denied the motion, finding that no defendant was in contempt. </p><p>In March 2019, a short time before the settlement was due to expire, the parties agreed to extend the settlement term. The state wanted to terminate the settlement in a different case about prisoners with serious mental illness at Indiana's Secured Housing Unit, Mast v. Commissioner, No. 2:05-cv-00037 (see related cases). The plaintiffs agreed to <i>that</i> termination if the settlement agreement in <i>this</i> case would be extended until one year after the Mast termination. The Court agreed to this approach. </p><p>After a fairness hearing, the Mast district court terminated that case on July 23, 2019. Accordingly, this case's settlement term was extended until July 23, 2020. However, due to a 2018 fire in the Pendleton Treatment Unit and delays in repairs, plaintiffs reported that, as of March 2020, the group therapy requirements specified in the settlement agreement are not being met. Instead of the required 10 hours of of out-of-cell treatment a week, some inmates at Pendleton are only receiving 3-5 hours of group therapy each week. As a result, plaintiffs have proposed extending the settlement an additional one year, to July 23, 2021, to allow the IDOC to achieve and maintain full compliance with the terms of the settlement before its termination. The IDOC is considering this proposal, and the case is ongoing.</p><p></p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2008, a federally-funded Protection and Advocacy organization filed this Southern District of Indiana lawsuit on behalf of prisoners with serious mental illness. After a bench trial, on Dec. 31, 2012, the court found that the Dept. of Corrections had violated the prisoners' 8th Amendment protections. In 2016, the parties reached a private settlement agreement, which was extended in March 2019 to last until July 2020. However, because the group therapy requirements prescribed by the settlement agreement are not currently being met, plaintiffs have proposed extending the settlement one additional year until July 2021.",

      "text": "Case 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 1 of 27 PageID #: 8852\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA \nINDIANAPOLIS DIVISION \n \n \nINDIANA PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY  ) \nSERVICES COMMISSION, et al.,      ) \n              ) \n    Plaintiffs,        ) \n              ) \n      v.        )  No. 1:08-cv-01317 TWP-MJD \n              ) \nCOMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT  ) \nOF CORRECTION,           )       \n              ) \n    Defendant.        ) \n \n \nStipulation to Enter Into Private Settlement Agreement  \nFollowing Notice to the Class and Fairness Hearing \n \n  The parties, in person and by their counsel, stipulate and agree as follows: \n \nI.   The history of the case \n \n1.  This action was filed in 2008 and sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the \nCommissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction (“DOC”). \n2.  The action alleged that the DOC violated both the Eighth Amendment and certain federal \nstatutes by housing seriously mentally ill prisoners in segregated or excessively isolated and \nharsh conditions where they failed to receive adequate mental health care. \n3.  At all times the DOC denied, and continues to deny, all of plaintiffs’ material allegations. \n4.  The operative complaint in this case is the Amended Complaint of December 2, 2009 \n(Dkt. 75-1, 75-2, 80), in which the plaintiffs are the Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services \nCommission and three prisoners, Joshua Harrison, Greggory Sims, and James Panozzo. \n5.  On  April  27,  2010,  the  Court  certified  this  case  as  a  class  action  with  the  class \nrepresented by the three prisoners and defined as: \nPage | 1  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 2 of 27 PageID #: 8853\n \nall current and future mentally ill prisoners who are committed to the Indiana Department \nof  Correction and who are housed in settings in Department of Correction Institutions or \nin the New Castle Correctional Facility that feature extended periods of time in cells, \nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  prisoners  in  disciplinary  segregation,  administrative \nsegregation, or in the New Castle Psychiatric Unit. \n \n(Dkt. 109). \n \n6.  The DOC no longer refers to “segregation,” and instead utilizes the term “restrictive \nstatus housing” and the parties therefore agree that the class includes those who are placed in \nwhat is now known as disciplinary restrictive status housing, administrative restrictive status \nhousing,  or  protective  custody,  as  well  as  the  New  Castle  Psychiatric  Unit.    The  term \n“segregation/restrictive  housing”  will  be  used  in  this  agreement  to  reflect  the  change  in \nterminology. \n7.  In an earlier decision, on July 21, 2009, the Court denied DOC’s motion to dismiss \nplaintiff Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services Commission, holding that Indiana Protection \nand Advocacy Services Commission had standing to sue on behalf of seriously mentally ill DOC \nprisoners. (Dkt. 58). \n8.  The Court conducted a bench trial in this case from July 25, 2011 through July 29, 2011. \n9.  The plaintiffs did not pursue their federal statutory claims, instead arguing only that the \nDOC was violating the Eighth Amendment rights of the prisoners included in the class. \n10.  On December 31, 2012, the Court issued its Entry Following Bench Trial (Dkt. 279), and \nconcluded that “Plaintiffs have prevailed as to their Eighth Amendment claim.” (Id. at 36).  The \nCourt did not, however, enter any final judgment at that time or at any time since. \n11.  Since the Court’s Entry the parties, as set out in more detail below, have been working to \naddress concerns expressed by the Court and to modify the conditions of confinement for the \nclass.  \nPage | 2  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 3 of 27 PageID #: 8854\n \n12.   The DOC continues to deny that it has at any time violated the Eighth Amendment rights \nof the class and denies the various claims made by plaintiffs to support their Eighth Amendment \nargument.  However, the parties are desirous of attempting to reach a settlement of this matter \nand therefore they enter into this Stipulation.  Plaintiffs stipulate that defendant’s entry into this \nPrivate Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) is not an admission of any kind and imposes no \nliability on defendant or any of its agents, employees, officers or other persons for any violation \nof law, constitutional or otherwise. \n13.  Insofar as the plaintiffs have sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of  the \nUnited States Constitution and federal law, this litigation is subject to the Prison Litigation \nReform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, et seq.  This Act imposes certain requirements on judicially \nsanctioned agreements made in litigation such as this, but provides that the parties may enter into \nprivate agreements which are exempted from the requirements of the Act.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(c).  \nHowever, such agreements are not subject to enforcement under federal law other than through \npotential reinstatement of the proceedings, although they are enforceable under state law as \nbreaches of contract.  Id. \n14.  Inasmuch as this case is a certified class action the Court must determine, pursuant to \nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that this Agreement is a fair, reasonable, and \nadequate resolution of this matter.  The Court cannot ascertain this until after reasonable notice is \ngiven to the class. Accordingly, even though this Private Settlement Agreement has been agreed \nto by the DOC and all named plaintiffs and Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services, it will not \ngo into effect until after notice is given to the class and the Court conducts the hearing required \nby Rule 23(e). Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services and the named plaintiffs specifically \nagree that their approval of this Agreement is contingent on the Court finding that the Agreement \nPage | 3  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 4 of 27 PageID #: 8855\n \nis fair, reasonable, and adequate, and in the event that the Court does not find that the Agreement \nis fair, reasonable, and adequate, this Agreement will immediately be deemed null and void. The \nplaintiffs will file, along with this Agreement, a motion seeking approval of the form and manner \nof notice to the class of this Agreement.  \n15.  Accordingly, to the extent that the parties agree to the terms and conditions as set forth \nbelow, this is deemed to be a private settlement agreement under the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct. \n16.  This Agreement is supported by good and valuable consideration.  This includes, but is \nnot limited to, the following.  Plaintiffs agree that they will not seek a final judgment in this \ncause.  The DOC agrees that it will not seek to appeal this Court’s Entry of December 31, 2012, \nwhether as an interlocutory matter or after final judgment, and will not challenge any of the \nCourt’s other rulings in this cause, unless this case is reinstated as set out below. \nII.   The definition and enumeration of seriously mentally ill prisoners \n \n17.  In the Court’s Entry of December 31, 2012, the Court defined seriously mentally ill \nprisoners as follows: \nprisoners with a current diagnosis or recent significant history of a DSM-IV Axis \nI  diagnosis  of:  schizophrenia,  delusional  disorder,  psychotic  disorder, \nschizoaffective  disorder,  schizophreniform  disorder,  major  depression,  bipolar \ndisorder who are actively suicidal. And, the term includes prisoners who have \nengaged in a recent serious suicide attempt, regardless of diagnosis, who because \nof their mental illness have a recent history of hallucinations, or who have organic \nbrain  syndrome,  mental  retardation,  or  severe  anxiety  disorder,  leading  to \nsignificant functional impairment or self-harm behaviors or who have personality \ndisorders manifesting in frequent episodes of psychosis or depression. \n \n(Dkt. 279 at 11). \n \n18.  The parties have agreed on the following definition of seriously mentally ill prisoners, \nwhich includes and expands upon the group of offenders covered by the Court’s definition: \nPage | 4  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 5 of 27 PageID #: 8856\n \na.   Prisoners  determined  to  have  a  current  diagnosis  or  recent  significant \nhistory  of  schizophrenia,  delusional  disorder,  schizophreniform  disorder, \nschizoaffective disorder, brief psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychotic \ndisorder  (excluding  intoxication  and  withdrawal),  undifferentiated  psychotic \ndisorder, bipolar I or II disorders; \n \nb.   Prisoners  diagnosed  with  any  other  validated  mental  illness  that  is \nclinically  severe,  based  on  evidence-based  standards,  and  that  results  in \nsignificant functional impairment; and \n \nc.   Prisoners diagnosed with an intellectual or developmental disability or \nother cognitive disorder that results in a significant functional impairment. \n   \n  d.  As used above: \n \n(i)  “Recent significant history” refers to a diagnosis made at any time \nin the last 12 months.  \n \n(ii)  “Significant functional impairment” includes one of the following \nas determined by qualified mental health staff: \n \n(cid:1)  Within  the  previous  6  months,  the  prisoner  haseither  made  a \nsuicide attempt that mental health staff considers serious, inflicted \nself-injury that mental health staff considers serious, or both; \n \n(cid:1)  The  prisoner  has  demonstrated  difficulty  in  his/her  ability  to \nengage in activities of daily living including: \n \no  Eating \no  Grooming and/or personal hygiene \no  Maintenance of housing area \no  Participation in recreation \no  Ambulation \n \n(cid:1)  The prisoner has demonstrated a pervasive pattern of dysfunctional \nor  disruptive  social  interactions,  bizarre  or  disruptive  behavior, \netc., as a result of mental illness. \n \n(iii)  A misdiagnosis does not qualify as a diagnosis or determination of \nmental illness for purposes of this settlement, once the error has been \ndetermined by a qualified mental health professional. \n \nPage | 5  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 6 of 27 PageID #: 8857\n \n19.  Inasmuch as the Court’s definition is subsumed within the definition noted in paragraph \n18, for the purpose of this Agreement the term “seriously mentally ill” is defined as noted in \nparagraph 18. \n20.  In May of 2013, a Request for Proposals created by the DOC estimated that that there \nwere  approximately  664  prisoners  to  whom  the  Court’s  December  31,  2012  Entry  applies, \nincluding  402  mentally  ill  prisoners  in  segregation/restrictive  housing  beds  and  128  such \nprisoners at the New Castle Psychiatric Facility and 134 prisoners at the Wabash Valley Special \nNeeds Unit. \nIII.  The development of mental health programming by the DOC following the Court’s \nEntry of December 31, 2012 \n \n21.  Following the Court’s December 31, 2012, Entry the parties met and the DOC committed \nto a course of action that would allow seriously mentally ill prisoners in the certified class to be \nplaced  in  a  setting  where  they  could  receive  at  least  10  hours  a  week  of  therapeutic \nprogramming, not including the time out of cell for recreation, showers, or other purposes \npermitted generally to offenders not in the certified class. The parties agreed, and continue to \nagree, that the term “therapeutic programming” can include formal group therapy, individual \ntherapy,  therapeutic  milieu  activity,  and  other  activity  as  determined  by  mental  health \nprofessionals as part of an individualized treatment plan.  The parties also agree, as set out \nfurther below, that under certain circumstances seriously mentally ill prisoners may be allowed \nto  remain  in  segregated/restrictive  housing  for  up  to  30  days  where  they  will  not  receive \ntherapeutic programming and that receipt of the therapeutic programming is subject to waiver \nand exceptional or extraordinary circumstances as described below.  \nPage | 6  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 7 of 27 PageID #: 8858\n \n22.  To this end the DOC determined to continue to utilize existing facilities and programs \nand  develop  new  facilities  and  programs  for  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoners  in \nsegregation/restrictive housing or similar housing in the DOC. \n23.   At the current time the following specialized mental health programs and facilities are in \nplace for male prisoners. \na.  New Castle Psychiatric Facility – This facility is located within the New Castle \nCorrectional Facility that is operated by the GEO Group.  It has 128 beds in 8 separate \ncell blocks.  At the current time prisoners are offered a minimum of 10 hours of out-of-\ncell therapeutic programming each week.  Depending on their functioning level they are \nprovided a decreasing amount of individual therapy from at least weekly to at least \nmonthly.  They are also provided at least one hour of recreation a day and three showers a \nweek.    Prisoners  are  provided  additional  out-of-cell  unstructured  time  as  warranted.  \nTreatment plans are maintained for all prisoners and are regularly reviewed by treatment \nteams made up of both treatment and correctional staff.  Prisoners who are on psychiatric \nmedication are regularly seen by either psychiatrists or advance practice nurses, or both, \nfor medication reviews and monitoring. \nb.   Wabash  Valley  Correctional  Facility  –  The  Special  Needs  Unit  (“SNU”) \ncontinues to house up to 134 mentally ill prisoners who can benefit from a transitional \nprogram in anticipation of returning to general population.  The prisoners are offered, at a \nminimum, 10 hours of out-of-cell therapeutic programming each week.  Treatment plans \nare maintained for all prisoners and are regularly reviewed by treatment teams made up \nof both treatment and correctional staff.  Prisoners who are on psychiatric medication are \nPage | 7  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 8 of 27 PageID #: 8859\n \nregularly  seen  by  psychiatrists  or  advance  practice  nurses,  or  both,  for  medication \nreviews and monitoring. \nc.   Pendleton Correctional Facility – Subsequent to the Court’s December 31, 2012, \nDecree  the  DOC  opened  a  new  unit  and  treatment  facility  known  as  the  Pendleton \nTreatment Unit/INSIGHT (Intent on Shaping Individual Growth with Holistic Treatment) \nUnit.  As currently envisioned, when fully occupied the unit will have the capacity to \nhouse  up  to  250  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoners,  many  of  whom  were  formerly  in \nsegregation/restrictive housing. Prisoners are being, or will be, housed in single cells or \ndouble cells, depending on their needs.  A structure at Pendleton Correctional Facility has \nbeen  rehabilitated  into  a  treatment  center,  complete  with  rooms  for  group  therapy, \nindividual therapy, and offices.  By agreement of the parties the treatment unit has been \npopulated slowly, approximately five new prisoners each week. Prisoners in this unit \nreceive at least 10 hours of out-of-cell therapeutic programming each week.  They are \nalso allowed, in addition to recreation and showers, significant time each day out of their \ncells for communal activities on their cell blocks and outside when weather permits. \nIndividualized treatment plans are maintained for all prisoners and are regularly reviewed \nby treatment teams made up of both treatment and correctional staff.  Prisoners who are \non psychiatric medication are regularly seen by either psychiatrists or advance practice \nnurses, or both, for medication reviews and monitoring. These occur at least every 90 \ndays. \n24.  The  number  of  seriously  mentally  ill  female  prisoners  is  significantly  less  than  the \nnumber of male prisoners.  Generally there have been no more than 10 seriously mentally ill \nfemale prisoners in segregation/restricted confinement at any one time.  These prisoners are \nPage | 8  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 9 of 27 PageID #: 8860\n \nhoused in the segregation/restrictive housing unit at the Indiana Women’s Prison.  However, \nunlike non-seriously mentally ill prisoners housed in that unit, these prisoners receive at least 10 \nhours of out-of-cell therapeutic programming each week.  Individual therapy is also provided as \nneeded. One hour of recreation is offered daily.  Seriously mentally ill prisoners are transitioned \nas quickly as possible from the segregation/restrictive housing unit to the special needs unit at \nIndiana Women’s Prison where prisoners are out of their cells, aside from count periods, from \napproximately 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. \n25.  The parties agree that there are also seriously mentally ill prisoners who are placed in \nsettings in the DOC other than the specialized units noted above. \nIV.  Substantive Agreement \n  Staffing \n26.  The  plaintiffs  acknowledge  that  the  DOC  has  made  extraordinary  efforts  since  the \nCourt’s Decree of December 31, 2012, to address the issues noted by the plaintiffs and the Court. \n27.  To meet the terms of the Private Settlement Agreement set out below the DOC, either \ndirectly or through its contract providers, has already, as appropriate, increased both correctional \nstaffing and mental health staffing for seriously mentally ill prisoners.  The DOC agrees that it \nwill maintain sufficient staff to manage the mental health units noted below and to identify \nseriously mentally ill prisoners and divert them from placement in segregated/restrictive housing \nin keeping with considerations of safety and security.  At the current time the DOC has no plans \nto decrease existing staffing levels.   \n28.  This agreement uses the term  “mental health  professional.”  This term includes the \nfollowing professionals: psychiatrists, psychologists, masters-prepared therapists, and psychiatric \nnurse practitioners. \nPage | 9  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 10 of 27 PageID #: 8861\n \nThe removal of seriously mentally ill from segregation/restrictive housing  \n \n29.  While not agreeing with the conclusions of the Court in its December 31, 2012 Entry or \nthat the following is mandated by the United States Constitution, and subject to the 30-day \nprovision, waiver and “exceptional circumstances” as defined in paragraphs 30, 32, and 33, the \nDOC agrees that: \na.  no  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoners  shall  be  placed  in  segregation/restrictive \nhousing (including protective custody) if they are known to be seriously mentally ill prior \nto such placement. \n \nb.   if a prisoner in segregation/restrictive housing (including protective custody) is \nfound to be, or becomes, seriously mentally ill subsequent to such placement the prisoner \nshall be removed at the earliest opportunity and placed into an appropriate placement \nwhere his or her mental illness can be addressed.  \n \n30.  This  private  settlement  agreement  is  subject  to  the  following  qualification  that  has \npreviously been referenced as “the 30-day provision.” The parties recognize that if a seriously \nmentally ill prisoner is scheduled to be in segregation/restrictive housing for 30 days or less that \nit may be more disruptive to his or her mental health to move the prisoner to a mental health unit.  \nTherefore, a seriously mentally ill prisoner may be placed into segregation/restrictive housing for \nas many as 30 continuous days if, and only if, mental health professionals determine that the \nprisoner may be safely housed in the segregated/restrictive housing for that period and that \nplacing the person in such housing is preferable to a short-term move to a mental health or other \nunit.   \n31.  If  a  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoner  continues  to  be  housed  in  segregated/restrictive \nhousing because the prisoner is scheduled to be in segregation/restricted housing for 30 days or \nless the prisoner will, at a minimum, have face-to-face contact with a mental health professional \nmultiple times a week, with no more than 3 non-contact days between contacts and with such \ncontact being recorded in the prisoner’s file and with the prisoner being offered out-of-cell \nPage | 10  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 11 of 27 PageID #: 8862\n \nevaluation and counseling by a mental health professional at least once every two weeks, but \nmore often if specified in the prisoner’s individualized treatment plan.  The prisoner will be \nremoved from the housing in the event that mental health staff determines that his or her mental \nhealth  has  decompensated  such  that  staying  in  segregation/restricted  housing,  even  for  the \nremaining period of time, would cause problems that outweigh the disruption to the prisoner’s \nmental health caused by the removal. \n32.  The parties acknowledge that there may be exceptional circumstances where barring or \nremoving a seriously mentally ill prisoner from segregation/restrictive housing would pose an \nunacceptable risk to the safety and security of one or more prisoners and/or the staff.  If such a \nsituation arises the need for confinement in segregation/restrictive housing must be approved by \nthe Superintendent of the facility where the prisoner is located, or his or her designee, following \nconsultation with an appropriate mental health professional. The opinions of the mental health \nstaff concerning the mental health needs of the prisoners will be honored unless there are real \nand  substantial  security  or  safety  concerns  noted.    The  decision  shall  be  recorded  in  the \nprisoner’s  permanent  record.  The  DOC  shall  attempt  to  resolve  any  such  exceptional \ncircumstances so that the prisoner may be removed from segregation/restrictive housing at the \nearliest possible opportunity.  If a determination of exceptional circumstances is made it shall be \nreviewed at least every 14 calendar days by the Superintendent, or his or her designee, the mental \nhealth treatment team in the facility, and the head of mental health services for either the DOC or \nany contract provider responsible for the provision of mental health services to DOC prisoners.  \nSuch review, and the decisions made as the result of the review, will be documented in writing in \nthe prisoner’s permanent record.  When the term “exceptional circumstances” is used in this \nAgreement with reference to retention of prisoners in segregation/restrictive housing it shall refer \nPage | 11  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 12 of 27 PageID #: 8863\n \nto the circumstances noted in this paragraph. In the event that a seriously mentally ill prisoner is \nrequired by exceptional circumstances to remain in segregated/restrictive housing a specific \nwritten plan of mental health care will be created for the prisoner that will set out the frequency \nof contact of the prisoner with mental health staff with the frequency to be at least that specified \nin paragraph 31 above.  Defendants will maintain a list of seriously mentally ill prisoners who \nremain in segregation because of exceptional circumstances, and share that list with plaintiffs’ \ncounsel no less often than once per calendar quarter on the request of plaintiffs’ counsel. \n33.  The parties acknowledge that some seriously mentally ill prisoners may refuse to leave \nsegregated/restrictive housing to go to an appropriate permanent placement where their mental \nillness may be best addressed. The DOC has the authority to involuntarily transfer a prisoner, \nand reserves the right to do so in appropriate circumstances as noted below.  The parties agree \nthat under the following circumstances a prisoner may waive the DOC recommendation that he \nor she leave segregated/restrictive housing.  If a prisoner indicates that he or she wishes to refuse \nto be transferred the refusal will be documented in the prisoner’s medical file.  All reasonable \nefforts will be made to counsel the prisoner to voluntarily leave segregation/restrictive housing. \nIn the event that a determination is made that the harm that will occur if the prisoner is allowed \nto remain in segregation/restricted housing outweighs the harm that the prisoner will suffer if the \nprisoner is moved to a placement where the prisoner is able to receive appropriate treatment for \nhis or her mental illness, the prisoner will be transferred even though the prisoner objects. If the \nprisoner is allowed to remain in segregation/restrictive housing, the prisoner will continue to be \nmonitored with the frequency noted in paragraphs 34-35  below and will, at least monthly, be \noffered the opportunity to be transferred if the prisoner’s mental health needs continue to warrant \nsuch a transfer. The DOC is not, however, required to provide the minimum adequate treatment \nPage | 12  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 13 of 27 PageID #: 8864\n \nset out in paragraph 42 below, and the provisions of this paragraph supersede the documentation \nand counseling requirements set forth in paragraph 43 below.  \nThe monitoring of prisoners in segregation/restricted housing \n34.  The  DOC  agrees  that  the  mental  health  status  and  needs  of  prisoners  in \nsegregated/restricted housing will be monitored frequently by mental health personnel to, among \nother things, assure that if they are seriously mentally ill, or become seriously mentally ill, steps \nwill be taken to remove them from the segregation/restrictive housing, subject to the exceptional \ncircumstances and waiver situations noted in paragraphs 32 and 33. \n35.  This  monitoring  shall  consist  of  daily  at-cell-front  monitoring  by  correctional  and \nmedical staff during each shift. Additionally, prisoners with a mental health diagnosis shall be \nvisited at least once a week, at their cell front, by mental health personnel and shall be offered \nmonthly out-of-cell monitoring by a mental health professional. Absent a significant change in \ncircumstances the weekly visit need not be recorded in the prisoner’s medical records although \nsome  general  log  or  record  will  be  kept  that  demonstrates  that  the  visit  occurred.  Unless \ncorrectional necessity dictates otherwise, out-of-cell monitoring will occur outside of the audible \nrange of correctional staff.  \n36.  In  the  event  that  a  female  prisoner  in  segregated/restrictive  housing  is  found  to  be \nseriously mentally ill she shall be placed in the segregated/restrictive housing unit at the Indiana \nWomen’s Prison, absent waiver or exceptional circumstances, and subject to the 30-day period \nnoted in paragraph 30 above, and offered minimum adequate treatment, as set out below. \nThe reclassification of mentally ill prisoners \n37.  The plaintiffs acknowledge that due to an original misdiagnosis or other circumstances, a \npatient previously classified as seriously mentally ill may properly no longer be so classified. \nPage | 13  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 14 of 27 PageID #: 8865\n \n38.  In the situation described in paragraph 37, a mental health professional may revise the \nprisoner’s prior diagnosis. Plaintiffs acknowledge that this rediagnosis may allow the DOC to \ncontinue to house the prisoner in segregation/restrictive housing. The DOC acknowledges that if \na prisoner is diagnosed with any of the mental illnesses noted in paragraph 18(a), the fact that the \ncondition is in remission is not, by itself, justification for a rediagnosis of the prisoner. \n39.  The DOC or its designee will notify the plaintiffs’ lead counsel, who is currently Kenneth \nJ. Falk, either before or, at the option of DOC, within 30 days after, the occurrence of either of \nthe following events: \na.  A  prisoner  who  was  reclassified  from  seriously  mentally  ill  to  not  seriously \nmentally  ill  is  placed  in  restrictive/segregated  housing  within  6  months  of  the \nreclassification; \nb.  A prisoner who is in restrictive/segregated housing is reclassified from seriously \nmentally ill to not seriously mentally ill and is retained in restrictive/segregated housing. \n40.  In the event of an occurrence described in Paragraph 39a or 39b, and regardless whether \nnotice has been given as provided in Paragraph 39, the plaintiffs’ counsel may review the \nprisoner’s medical records upon submission of a written request.  The defendant’s counsel will \nbe notified in writing if the identity of the plaintiffs’ lead counsel changes. \nThe provision of minimum adequate treatment to seriously mentally ill prisoners in the \nDOC’s mental health units \n \n41.  As  indicated  above,  the  DOC  is  maintaining  a  number  of  correctional  placements \nspecifically for prisoners who are seriously mentally ill.  These placements, referred to below as \n“mental health units” are: \na.   For male prisoners – New Castle Psychiatric Facility, Special Needs  Unit at \nWabash Valley Correctional Facility, and the Pendleton Treatment Unit. \nPage | 14  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 15 of 27 PageID #: 8866\n \nb.   For female prisoners – The segregation/restrictive housing unit at the Indiana \nWomen’s Prison and the Special Needs Unit at the Indiana Women’s Prison. \nThe DOC has no current plans to change the location of these specialized units for the housing of \nseriously mentally ill prisoners.  \n42. The DOC agrees that absent extraordinary circumstances, as set out below in paragraphs 46-\n47, every seriously mentally ill prisoner who is housed at the New Castle Psychiatric Facility, the \nSpecial Needs Unit at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility, the Pendleton Treatment Unit, or \nthe  segregation/restrictive  housing  unit  at  the  Indiana  Women’s  Prison  shall  receive  the \nfollowing treatment, at a minimum, while confined in the respective unit. This is referred to in \nthis Agreement as “minimum adequate treatment.” \na.   An individualized treatment plan created by a treatment team consisting of mental \nhealth  professionals  and  correctional  staff  who  are  familiar  with  the  prisoner.    The \nindividualized treatment plan will be specific to the prisoner and will be reviewed at least \nevery 90 days. \nb.  At least 10 hours of therapeutic programming each week, which can include \nformal group therapy, individual therapy, therapeutic milieu activity, and other activity \ndetermined by a mental health professional to be therapeutic, as individually tailored to \nthe  prisoner  by  mental  health  professionals.  Normal  recreation  is  excluded  from \ntherapeutic  programming  hours.    Prisoners  will  be  allowed  to  attend  group  therapy \nsessions  without  restraints,  except  to  the  extent  restraints  are  deemed  necessary  for \nsecurity reasons. Prisoners will receive individual therapy at least once a month and more \nas needed. The individual therapy will be provided by a mental health professional. \nPrisoners will be allowed to attend individual therapy without restraints, except to the \nPage | 15  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 16 of 27 PageID #: 8867\n \nextent  restraints  are  deemed  necessary  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for  security  reasons. \nUnless unsafe to do so for security reasons, as determined on a case-by-case basis, the \npatient and the therapist will be provided aural privacy. Individual therapy does not \ninclude medication reviews of prisoners receiving psychiatric medication that will occur \nby a psychiatrist or other medical doctor or advanced practice nurse consistent with \nexisting DOC policy. \nc.   Recreation and showers will be offered consistent with general DOC policy.  \nd.  As noted, the 10 hours a week of therapeutic programming is a minimum amount \nand additional hours may be provided. \ne.  Where possible and appropriate the prisoners will be provided additional out-of-\ncell time that may, or may not, involve therapeutic programming.  \n43.  The minimum adequate treatment referred to in this Agreement represents out-of-cell \nopportunities offered to prisoners.  The parties recognize that prisoners may, at times, refuse the \noffer of out-of-cell opportunities either because of their mental illnesses or for other reasons.  In \nthe event that a prisoner refuses to attend either individual or group therapy, the refusal will be \ndocumented in the prisoner’s medical records.  On any day on which the prisoner refuses to \nattend therapy, the prisoner will be visited at least once by a member of the mental health staff, \nwho will endeavor to counsel and work with the prisoner so that he or she will attend future \nmeetings.  This will also be documented in the prisoner’s medical records.  The DOC may \nwithhold privileges, such as access to a television, in order to facilitate the prisoner’s therapeutic \ninvolvement. \n44.  Seriously mentally ill prisoners will not be discharged from the New Castle Psychiatric \nUnit or the mental health program at the Indiana Women’s Prison because of their refusal to \nPage | 16  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 17 of 27 PageID #: 8868\n \nparticipate in minimum adequate treatment unless the treatment team is in agreement that the \noffender is competent to refuse to participate and that discharge from the unit does not pose an \nexcessive  risk  to  the  offender’s  mental  health.    If  the  prisoner  is  discharged  into \nsegregation/restrictive housing his or her mental health will be monitored as noted above in \nparagraphs 34-36.  If the prisoner is discharged into a unit that is not segregation or restricted \nhousing the prisoner will also receive appropriate monitoring.  The purpose of the monitoring is \nto  ascertain,  and  attempt  to  prevent,  any  deterioration  in  the  prisoner’s  mental  health.  If \nplacement back into the New Castle Psychiatric Unit or the mental health program at the Indiana \nWomen’s Prison remains appropriate the prisoner will be returned if a determination is made that \nhe or she will participate. \n45.  A  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoner  may  be  removed  involuntarily  from  the  Pendleton \nTreatment Unit or the SNU only under the following circumstances: \n  a.  The prisoner requires a higher degree of care than is provided in that unit. \n  b.  The prisoner does not require the care provided in that unit. \n  c.  The prisoner’s continued presence in that unit endangers his own safety and security \nor that of others, as in the case of prisoners in separatee status. \n  d.  The prisoner needs health care other than mental health care that cannot be provided \nadequately in the unit. \n46.  The requirements of the paragraphs above, concerning the provision of treatment to \nprisoners in the mental health units maintained by the DOC, are subject to prisoner-specific \nemergency  circumstances  where  a  particular  prisoner  is  not  offered  minimum  adequate \ntreatment.  These emergency circumstances exist where removing the prisoner, or allowing the \nprisoner to exit his or her cell, to attend the specified treatment would pose an unacceptable risk \nPage | 17  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 18 of 27 PageID #: 8869\n \nto the safety and security of prisoners and/or the staff.  It is anticipated that if such a situation \narises it will last only until the prisoner’s condition has been stabilized and the prisoner can \nsafely leave his or her cell.  In such a situation the need to remove the prisoner from the \nminimum adequate treatment must be documented in the prisoner’s medical record and the \nprisoner must be visited at least daily by a mental health professional to ascertain the prisoner’s \ncondition and to assist the prisoner in reaching the stabilized condition that will allow him or her \nto resume receiving the minimum adequate treatment.  These daily visits will allow for a daily \nreview as to whether the prisoner may resume minimum adequate treatment.  These visits should \ntake place outside of the prisoner’s cell if possible but if the prisoner’s condition does not safely \nallow such a visit it may occur at cell-front.   \n47.   Additionally, short-term emergency situations affecting the specific mental health unit \nmay justify the temporary suspension of treatment, however such suspension shall only be for \nthe  period  of  time  that  an  emergency  exists.   During  a  facility-wide  lockdown,  DOC  will \ncontinue to provide minimum adequate treatment to seriously mentally ill prisoners unless doing \nso poses an unacceptable risk to the safety and security of the facility, its staff, its prisoners, or \nthe public. \n  The discharge of prisoners from the mental health units \n48.  Discharge planning will be considered by the treatment team each time a prisoner’s \ntreatment plan is reviewed.  The goal for each prisoner in each of the DOC’s mental health units \nis to discharge him or her into an appropriate general population setting when it is therapeutically \nappropriate to do so.    \n49.  While prisoners who, but for this agreement, would be in disciplinary restrictive housing \nare committed to one of the mental health units described above, their disciplinary time will \nPage | 18  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 19 of 27 PageID #: 8870\n \n“run” so that each day in the mental health unit will be treated as one less day of disciplinary \nconfinement.  If a seriously mentally ill prisoner has disciplinary restrictive housing time left at \nthe time of his or her discharge from the mental health unit, the prisoner will be returned to \nsegregated/restrictive housing only if exceptional circumstances, as outlined in more detail in \nparagraph 32, are present such that placing the prisoner outside of segregation/restrictive housing \nwould pose an unacceptable risk to the safety and security of prisoners and/or the staff.  If the \nDOC contemplates returning the prisoner to disciplinary restrictive housing it must comply with \nall requirements and procedures noted in paragraph 32. If the prisoner’s diagnosis or condition \nhas changed such that he or she is no longer seriously mentally ill, the prisoner will not be \nreturned to disciplinary restrictive housing unless approved by the Executive Director of Mental \nHealth  and  Special  Populations,  or  his  or  her  designee,  following  consultation  with  an \nappropriate  mental  health  professional.    The  decision  shall  be  recorded  in  the  prisoner’s \npermanent record. \n50.  A seriously mentally ill prisoner who was, prior to admission to a mental health unit, in \nadministrative restrictive housing or protective custody will be returned to such housing only if \nexceptional circumstances, as outlined in more detail in paragraphs 32 and 33, are present such \nthat placing the prisoner outside of segregation/restrictive housing would pose an unacceptable \nrisk to the safety and security of one or more prisoners and/or the staff.  If the DOC contemplates \nreturning the prisoner to administrative restrictive housing or protective custody it must comply \nwith all requirements and procedures noted in paragraph 32 or 33. If the prisoner’s diagnosis or \ncondition has changed such that he or she is no longer seriously mentally ill, the prisoner will not \nbe returned to administrative restrictive housing or protective custody unless approved by the \nSuperintendent of the facility where the prisoner is located, or his or her designee, following \nPage | 19  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 20 of 27 PageID #: 8871\n \nconsultation with an appropriate mental health professional.  The decision shall be recorded in \nthe prisoner’s permanent record. \n51.    If a prisoner is released out of the DOC directly from a mental health unit, discharge \nplanning will begin at the earliest opportunity, including contact with outside mental health \nproviders to establish continuity of treatment to the greatest extent possible.  \n  Discipline \n52.  Prisoners within the mental health units noted above are subject to all disciplinary rules \nand policies of the DOC.  However, the DOC acknowledges that it is inappropriate to punish a \nmentally ill prisoner if the conduct in question is caused or strongly influenced by the prisoner’s \nmental illness. \n53.   Accordingly, the DOC’s Disciplinary Code for Adult Offenders (currently Policy and \nAdministrative Procedure  - Manual of Policies and Procedures [No.  02-04-101]) currently \nprovides that in the event that discipline is contemplated with a prisoner with a mental illness, \nthe Disciplinary Review Officer will contact the appropriate mental health professional.  If it is \ndetermined that the incident in question was the result of the prisoner’s mental illness, the \nprisoner will receive a written reprimand documenting the behavior, but will not receive other \ndiscipline.    The  parties  agree  that  the  DOC  may  change  its  Disciplinary  Code  for  Adult \nOffenders without notice to, or consultation with, plaintiffs’ counsel.  However, the DOC agrees \nthat prior to imposing discipline upon any prisoner who is seriously mentally ill and resides \nwithin a mental health or segregation unit that the appropriate mental health professional with \nthat unit will be contacted and if it is determined that the incident in question was the result of \nthe prisoner’s mental illness, the prisoner will receive a written reprimand documenting the \nbehavior, but will not receive other discipline. \nPage | 20  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 21 of 27 PageID #: 8872\n \n54.  As a temporary modification of the treatment plan a prisoner may be confined without \naccess to the minimum adequate treatment set out above.  However, such confinement will \nexceed 7 continuous days in duration only under emergent conditions that threaten safety or \nsecurity.  During such time the prisoner will be seen daily by a mental health professional, with \nthe  meeting  occurring  out-of-cell  if  possible  consistent  with  institutional  security  and  the \nprisoner’s mental health.  The prisoner will be released from such confinement for recreation \nwhen doing so is consistent with considerations of safety and security. \n  Observation of those who threaten suicide or self-harm or engage in self-harm \n55.  If a prisoner threatens suicide or self-harm, or engages in self-harm, he or she may be \nplaced in a setting consistent with the suicide-safer cell checklists outlined within DOC policy. \n56.  During the time that the prisoner is confined in such setting the DOC is not required to \nprovide the prisoner with the minimum adequate treatment noted above.  In that event, consistent \nwith DOC policy, mental health staff will monitor the prisoner daily and the prisoner will be \nprovided appropriate mental health services and treatment. \n  Policies and procedures \n57.  The DOC routinely creates certain documents, including, but not limited to, documents in \nits  Manual  of  Policies  and  Administrative  Procedures,  which  set  out  the  procedures  to  be \nfollowed throughout the DOC. \n58.  Additionally, DOC facilities may create facility or program-specific rules and guidelines. \n59.  The DOC has provided the plaintiffs’ counsel with hard copies, digital copies, or both of \na number of Administrative Policies and Procedures and other DOC-created documents that have \nbeen created specifically for use in the mental health units or otherwise deal specially with \nmentally ill prisoners. \nPage | 21  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 22 of 27 PageID #: 8873\n \n60.   The DOC is free to create new documents or alter these existing ones.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \nmay,  every  six  months,  request  and  receive  from  defendant’s  counsel  new  and  amended \nAdministrative  Policies  and  Procedures  and  other  DOC-created  documents  that  have  been \ncreated specifically for use in the mental health units or otherwise deal specially with mentally ill \nprisoners.  \n  Continued right of review by plaintiffs’ counsel \n61.  The DOC recognizes that during the time that this Agreement is actively in effect, as set \nout below, plaintiffs’ counsel will have a continued right to information and review of the \ntreatment of seriously mentally ill prisoners as follows: \na.  If the DOC alters the location or identity of any of its mental health units it shall \nimmediately notify plaintiffs’ counsel. \nb.  The DOC will transmit to plaintiffs’ counsel any new policies or procedures used \nin any of the mental health treatment units within 30 days of the time they go into effect. \nc.  Every six months plaintiffs’ counsel, either by themselves or with their retained \nconsultants, may tour each or any of the DOC’s mental health units. \nd.  If plaintiffs’ counsel have specific named prisoners concerning whom they have \nquestions, they may review the medical records of the prisoners upon notice to the \ndefendant’s counsel of record in this cause or the DOC’s Director of Legal Services. \ne.   At least once every six months plaintiffs’ counsel, upon application, will be given \naccess to the medical records of 10 prisoners from each of the DOC’s mental health units \nas well as the Westville Control Unit and Custody and Control Unit at the Wabash Valley \nCorrectional Facility. \nPage | 22  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 23 of 27 PageID #: 8874\n \nf.   The above enumerated records may not be all the records desired by plaintiffs’ \ncounsel in the future.  Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledges that the DOC has been extremely \naccommodating in sharing information since the Court’s Decree of December 31, 2012.  \nThe parties fully anticipate that this cooperation will continue and defendant’s counsel \nwill comply with all reasonable requests for documents by plaintiffs’ counsel. \ng.   Unless the Court specifies otherwise, the parties agree to file a status report with \nthe Court at least every six months, with the first report to be filed no later than six \nmonths after the date that this Private Settlement Agreement is approved by the Court. \n62.   Nothing  in  the  preceding  paragraph  prevents  employees  of  Indiana  Protection  and \nAdvocacy Services from seeking access to prisoners’ records if such access is necessary for \nmatters that fall within the organization’s statutory and regulatory purview and are unrelated to \nthis litigation. \n  Attorneys’ Fees – Monitoring Activities \n63.  Defendant shall pay to plaintiffs’ counsel the sum of $585,000 in full satisfaction of any \nclaims in this lawsuit for attorneys’ fees and costs owing as of the date of this Agreement.  The \npayment shall be made within 60 days of the Court finding that this Settlement Agreement is \nfair, reasonable, and adequate pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n64.  As noted above, plaintiffs’ counsel anticipate that they will continue to monitor this \nagreement during the time that it remains in effect.  Absent a final judgment or other order that \nallows fees to be sought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, plaintiffs’ counsel will not seek attorneys’ \nfees or costs for their monitoring efforts.   \nPage | 23  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 24 of 27 PageID #: 8875\n \n65.  Plaintiffs’ counsel reserve the right to employ consultants to assist in monitoring efforts.  \nIf defendant agrees in writing, including via electronic communication, to that retention and to \nthe identity of any consultant so retained, defendant will reimburse one-half of the cost incurred. \nV.  Further proceedings \n66.  The defendants will not be required to be in full compliance with the terms of this \nagreement until 90 days have passed from the date the Court finds this agreement to be fair, \nreasonable, and adequate.  \n67.   In the event that plaintiffs believe that the DOC is not complying with the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement they will report this to defendant’s counsel in writing and the parties will \nmeet within 30 days, if necessary, to resolve the alleged non-compliance.  If plaintiffs believe \nthat the alleged non-compliance is still not resolved they may, no earlier than 14 days after the \nmeeting, move this Court for a status conference to discuss this matter with the Court or the \nMagistrate Judge. \n68.  The parties recognize that this Settlement Agreement is in lieu of any further decisions in \nthis matter by the Court. Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek to reinstate the case and seek further \nformal relief from the Court if the request for the status conference noted above does not resolve \nthe plaintiffs’ concerns.  However, if plaintiffs do this then this Settlement Agreement is null and \nvoid and both parties retain their right to appeal following a final judgment in this cause, or as \notherwise permitted by rules of procedure. \n69.  Plaintiffs may, if they believe that this Agreement is not being complied with, elect to file \na breach of contract action in Indiana state court. \nPage | 24  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 25 of 27 PageID #: 8876\n \n \nVI.  Termination of this Agreement \n70.  It is the parties’ intention that this Agreement will remain actively in effect for 3 years \nfrom the date that the Court finds that it is a fair, adequate, and reasonable settlement pursuant to \nRule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  At that point, absent written agreement as \nnoted in paragraph 71 below, the case will automatically be dismissed without prejudice. \n71.  The period that this Settlement Agreement is actively in effect may be extended by \nwritten agreement of the parties entered into before the end of the 3-year period noted above.  It \nmay thereafter be further extended by written agreement of the parties.  In the event of any \nextension the case will be automatically dismissed without prejudice at the end of the extended \nperiod. \nPage | 25  \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 496   Filed 01/27/16   Page 26 of 27 PageID #: 8877\n \nFor the plaintiffs: \n \n              s/ Kenneth J.

IPAS\nchallenges IDOC’s alleged practice of isolating and secluding prisoners with\nserious mental illnesses and its failure to provide those prisoners with sufficient\ntreatment programs and placements.  IPAS claims that IDOC’s practices violate\nthe Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12132)\nand the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794).  IDOC has moved to dismiss IPAS’s\nsuit under Rule 12(b)(1), arguing that IPAS lacks standing to sue on behalf of\nunidentified individuals and that this court lacks jurisdiction over a supposedly\n“intramural” dispute between state agencies.  As explained below, the court denies\nIDOC’s motion.  First, by suing on behalf of mentally ill individuals, IPAS is\n\nexercising the powers and duties assigned to it by federal statute, and that\nassignment is constitutional.  Second, this dispute is not a typical “intramural”\ndispute between state agencies that the governor should resolve.  Instead, IPAS\nis trying to carry out a federal statutory directive to act independently of other\nstate agencies to protect and advocate for mentally ill individuals.  The governor\nhas no authority to resolve this dispute by telling IPAS to drop this lawsuit.\nThe Role of IPAS in Enforcing Federal Law\nIPAS is a “protection and advocacy” or “P&A” organization established\npursuant to federal law.  In Disability Rights Wisconsin, Inc. v. State of Wisconsin\nDepartment of Public Instruction, 463 F.3d 719, 724-25 (7th Cir. 2006), the Seventh\nCircuit outlined the role of protection and advocacy organizations.  As a condition\nof federal funding, states are required to designate protection and advocacy\norganizations  to  act  on  behalf  of  people  with  mental  illness,  developmental\ndisabilities, and other disabilities.  The specific statute at issue in this case is the\nProtection and Advocacy of Mentally Ill Individuals Act (“PAIMI”) enacted in 1986.1\nCongress found that “individuals with mental illness are vulnerable to abuse and\n1The other protection and advocacy laws are the Protection and Advocacy\nfor Developmental Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15043 et seq., and the Protection\nand Advocacy for Individual Rights Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e.  Together, these\nstatutes  are  referred  to  as  the  federal  “Protection  and  Advocacy”  or  “P&A,”\nstatutes,  which  “Congress  enacted  after  concluding  that  state  systems  for\nprotecting the rights of individuals with disabilities varied widely and were in\nmany cases inadequate.”  Disability Rights Wisconsin, 463 F.3d at 722.  The\nSeventh Circuit explained in Disability Rights Wisconsin the reasons for favoring\nthe acronym PAIMI in light of 1988 amendments to the Act.  Id. at 722 n.2.\n-2-\n\nserious injury” and enacted the PAIMI to “ensure that the rights of individuals\nwith mental illness are protected” and to “assist States to establish and operate\na protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness which will\n. . . protect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities to\nensure the enforcement of the Constitution and Federal and State statutes . . . .”\n42 U.S.C. §§ 10801(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(2)(A).\nThe PAIMI requires each state, as a condition of receiving certain federal\nfunding, to designate a “system” (i.e., a government agency or private organization)\nas the protection and advocacy service for the state.  42 U.S.C. § 10803.  The\ndesignated system or entity must comply with the conditions of independence and\nauthority set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 10805.  If a government agency is designated,\nthe agency “shall be independent of any agency which provides treatment or\nservices (other than advocacy services) to individuals with mental illness” and\n“shall have the capacity to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\nmental illness.”  42 U.S.C.A. § 10804.  The designated protection and advocacy\nagency must have, under federal law:\nthe authority to . . . pursue administrative, legal, and other appropriate\nremedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are\nreceiving care or treatment in the State; and pursue administrative, legal,\nand other appropriate remedies on behalf of an individual who . . . was an\nindividual with a mental illness; and  . . . is a resident of the State, but only\nwith respect to matters which occur within 90 days after the date of\ndischarge of such individual from a facility providing care or treatment.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(1)(B), (C). \n-3-\n\nThe  federal  statutory  definition  of  an  “individual  with  mental  illness”\nincludes any individual diagnosed with a significant mental illness or emotional\nimpairment  who  is  an  inpatient  or  resident  in  a  facility  rendering  care  or\ntreatment, including individuals involuntarily confined in a detention facility, jail,\nor prison, and Congress has defined “facilities” to include jails and prisons.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 10802(3), (4); 42 C.F.R. § 51.2.  In other words, under federal law,\nprotection and advocacy services must have the ability to bring lawsuits on behalf\nof mentally ill prisoners.\nIndiana has chosen to designate IPAS as the entity in Indiana to receive\nfederal funding for protection and advocacy services for the mentally ill under the\nPAIMI.  See Ind. Code § 12-28-1-1, et seq.  As a matter of federal law, therefore,\nIPAS must have the independence and authority required under the PAIMI,\nincluding the authority to bring lawsuits on behalf of mentally ill prisoners.\nIPAS is controlled by a governing board of thirteen persons.  Ind. Code § 12-\n28-1-6.  Four of its members are appointed by the Governor.  The other nine are\nappointed by majority vote of the governing board itself.  Ind. Code § 12-28-1-\n6(a)(1), (2).  No board member may be an official or employee of any state agency\nthat delivers services to the population served by IPAS.  Ind. Code § 12-28-1-6(b).\nUnder the PAIMI, the IPAS board must “include a significant representation of\nindividuals with mental illness who are, or have been eligible for services, or who\nhave received or are receiving mental health services, and family members,\n-4-\n\nguardians,  advocates,  or  authorized  representatives  of  such  individuals.”\n42 C.F.R. § 51.22(b)(2).  The PAIMI also requires that IPAS be guided by an\nadvisory council, “at least 60 percent of the membership of which shall be\ncomprised of individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services\nor who are family members of such individuals.”  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(6)(B).  \nStandard for Jurisdictional Challenge\nWhen a defendant moves under Rule 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction based on the allegations in the complaint, the court accepts\nas true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in\nfavor of the plaintiff.  Long v. Shorebank Development Corp., 182 F.3d 548, 554\n(7th Cir. 1999);  United Transp. Union v. Gateway Western Ry. Co., 78 F.3d 1208,\n1210 (7th Cir. 1996).  The court may consider additional evidence that the parties\nsubmit to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.  Long, 182 F.3d\nat 554.  Here, IPAS submitted the affidavit of Thomas Gallagher, the executive\ndirector of IPAS.  \nDiscussion\nI. Standing\nThe standing requirements under Article III of the Constitution are well\nsettled:    “injury  in  fact,  a  causal  connection  between  the  injury  and  the\n-5-\n\ndefendant’s conduct, and likely redressability through a favorable decision.”\nWinkler v. Gates, 481 F.3d 977, 979 (7th Cir. 2007), citing Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  “Ordinarily . . . the allegation [of a\nreasonable probability of suffering tangible harm] is enough.”  MainStreet Org. of\nRealtors v. Calumet City, 505 F.3d 742, 745 (7th Cir. 2007).  The components of\nstanding ensure that plaintiffs possess “such a personal stake in the outcome of\nthe controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the\npresentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination\nof difficult constitutional questions.”  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962).\nWithout referring in its opening brief to the applicable statutes or cases\ninvolving protection and advocacy agencies, IDOC argues that IPAS lacks standing\nbecause it has not alleged that IPAS itself has been injured and has not identified\nspecifically any of its constituents who have been injured.  IPAS does not argue\nthat it has suffered injury or that, as an agency, it will benefit from a favorable\ndecision.  IPAS contends that it has associational standing to bring suit on behalf\nof its “client-constituents.”  Pl. Response 9.  As the party seeking to invoke federal\njurisdiction, IPAS has the burden of establishing that it meets the requirements\nof standing.  DH2, Inc. v. S.E.C., 422 F.3d 591, 596 (7th Cir. 2005).\nAs described above, by Congressional design, IPAS and the protection and\nadvocacy  agencies  of  other  states  are  intermediary  entities.    They  can  be\ngovernmental  agencies  (like  IPAS)  or  quasi-governmental  entities  that  are\n-6-\n\nresponsible for enforcing federal and state law on behalf of individuals with\ndisabilities who otherwise would face perhaps insurmountable obstacles to seeing\ntheir rights enforced and their interests protected.  The protection and advocacy\nsystem is not unique in this regard.  In many fields, Congress has empowered\nother third parties, including state and federal agencies, to protect the rights of\nindividuals disadvantaged for other reasons.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3616a(a)(1)\n(authorizing  fair  housing  organizations  to  “obtain  enforcement  of  the  rights\ngranted by title VIII [of the Fair Housing Act] . . . through such appropriate judicial\nor administrative proceedings . . . as are available”); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)\n(authorizing the Attorney General to initiate civil actions against private employers\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and § 2000e-4(g)(6) (authorizing the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission to “intervene in a civil action brought\n. . . by an aggrieved party”); 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) (granting Secretary power to\ninitiate various civil actions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act);\n15 U.S.C. § 15c (authorizing state attorneys general to bring a federal action on\nbehalf of the state’s citizens under federal antitrust law).\nThese  other  entities  certainly  have  standing  to  carry  out  Congress’s\nmandate in the federal courts because, as the Supreme Court has commented,\nwhile agencies normally do not have standing in their own right, Congress has the\nability  to  grant  that  standing  “by  say[ing]  so.”  Director,  Office  of  Workers’\nCompensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S.\n122, 129-30 (1995) (holding that without clear statutory authority to do so,\n-7-\n\ngovernment agency did not have standing to appeal arguably inadequate award\nof compensation to injured longshoreman, and collecting statutes that do provide\nclear authority for government agencies to act on behalf of individuals in similar\nmatters).  As part of the PAIMI, as with these other statutes, Congress has said so.\nAs a condition of Indiana’s receipt of certain federal funding, IPAS must have\nstanding to sue on behalf of mentally ill constituents.  Congress cannot waive the\nconstitutional  requirements  of  Article  III,  but  once  those  constitutional\nrequirements are met, Congress has clearly vested IPAS and other protection and\nadvocacy organizations with “the authority to . . . pursue administrative, legal,\nand other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with\nmental illness who are receiving care or treatment in the State.”  42 U.S.C.\n§§ 10805(a)(1)(B).\nIn fact, courts around the country have rejected similar standing challenges\nto protection and advocacy services.  See, e.g., Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink,\n322 F.3d 1101, 1109-11 (9th Cir. 2003); Doe v. Stincer, 175 F.3d 879, 885-86\n(11th Cir. 1999) (holding that 42 U.S.C. § 10805 confers standing to bring suit on\nbehalf of individuals with mental illness); New Jersey Protection & Advocacy, Inc. v.\nDavy, 2005 WL 2416962, at *2-3 (D.N.J. Sept. 30, 2005); University Legal Servs.,\nInc. v. Saint Elizabeths Hosp., 2005 WL 3275915, at *4-5 (D.D.C. July 22, 2005)\n(“By  providing  [P&As]  the  authority  to  sue  on  behalf  of  their  constituents,\nCongress has cleared away any non-constitutional impediments for ULS . . . in\nsituations stated in § 1085.”); Aiken v. Nixon, 236 F. Supp. 2d 211, 224 (N.D.N.Y.\n-8-\n\n2002) (finding that “in light of the fact that the Court has concluded that [the\nindividual plaintiff] has standing to bring his individual claim, there are also\nsufficient allegations to find that [the P&A plaintiff] has associational standing to\nbring the same claims on behalf of its constituents.”); Risinger v. Concannon,\n117 F. Supp. 2d 61, 68-70 (D. Me. 2000); Advocacy Center v. Stalder, 128 F. Supp.\n2d 358, 365-66 (M.D. La. 1999); Brown v. Stone, 66 F. Supp. 2d 412, 425\n(E.D.N.Y.  1999)  (“standing  appears  warranted”  under  42  U.S.C.  §  10805);\nRubenstein v. Benedictine Hospital, 790 F. Supp. 396, 408-09 (N.D.N.Y. 1992)\n(finding standing under 42 U.S.C. § 10801, given its “broad remedial purposes”\nand “the statutory language apparently conferring a right upon entities such as\nDAI to pursue legal remedies”); Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, Inc. v.\nBabin, 799 F. Supp. 695, 702 n.12 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (finding in reference to the\nPAIMI that “[i]t was clearly the intention of Congress that the MPAS and other\nsimilar  advocacy  groups  represent  and,  if  necessary,  litigate  on  behalf  of\nindividuals suffering from developmental disabilities”), aff’d on other grounds,\n18 F.3d 337 (6th Cir.1994); Protection and Advocacy, Inc. v. Murphy, 1992 WL\n59100, *10 (N.D. Ill. 1992) ( “Federal courts have uniformly found that protection\nand advocacy systems have standing to sue in their own name to protect the\nrights  of  injured  developmentally  disabled  or  mentally  ill  individuals.”);\nGoldstein v. Coughlin, 83 F.R.D. 613, 614 (W.D.N.Y. 1979) (reasoning that “given\nthe Congressional purpose to provide retarded persons with legal representation,\nas revealed in § 6012,” state’s designated advocacy group “need show no injury to\nitself in order to have standing in this action”); but see Missouri Protection and\n-9-\n\nAdvocacy Services., Inc. v. Carnahan, 499 F.3d 803, 809-10 (8th Cir. 2007)\n(denying associational standing without discussion of protection and advocacy\nstatutes or Congressional intent); Association for Retarded Citizens of Dallas v.\nDallas County Mental Health & Mental Retardation Board of Trustees, 19 F.3d 241,\n244 (5th Cir. 1994) (same).\nStatutory standing is clear.  In fact, this case presents the unusual drama\nof a state challenging the constitutionality of federal statutes under which the\nstate receives federal funds.  IDOC is challenging whether the federal statutory\ngrant of standing to IPAS – a key condition of federal funding to Indiana – violates\nArticle III of the United States Constitution.  Constitutional standing requirements\ncannot be waived, of course, but the statutory grant of standing to protection and\nadvocacy groups means that the so-called “prudential” elements of standing\ndoctrine, including the limits on asserting the rights of others, do not apply.  See,\ne.g., Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d at 1109-10 (explaining statutory\neffects  on  standing  for  protection  and  advocacy  organizations);  Risinger  v.\nConcannon, 117 F. Supp. 2d at 68-70 (same).\nAs for the constitutional elements, courts usually structure the analysis of\nassociational standing and the organization’s ability to bring suit on behalf of its\nmembers  under  the  test  articulated  by  the  Supreme  Court  for  private\norganizations in Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333\n(1977).  Under the Hunt test, the protection and advocacy organization must show\n-10-\n\nthat (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, (2)\nthe interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose, and (3)\nneither the claims asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participation of\nindividual members in the lawsuit.  Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343.  The third Hunt\nrequirement does not derive from the Constitution.  Instead, it is a judicially\nimposed limitation, United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown\nGroup, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 556-57 (1996), which may be overridden by Congress.\nFamily & Children’s Ctr., Inc. v. School City of Mishawaka, 13 F.3d 1052, 1059 (7th\nCir.1994).  It has been overridden by Congress in the realm of protection and\nadvocacy organizations.  E.g., Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d at 1109-\n11.\nIPAS  easily  satisfies  these  constitutional  criteria.    Its  mentally  ill\nconstituents clearly would have standing to sue on their own behalf for violations\nof federal and state law in the conditions of their custody.  See Disability Rights\nWisconsin, Inc. v. Walworth County Board of Supervisors, 522 F.3d 796, 802 (7th\nCir. 2008) (applying Hunt test and recognizing that protection and advocacy\norganization would have standing if any individual whose rights it was supposed\nto protect would have standing).  The interests that IPAS seeks to protect are not\nmerely germane to the agency’s purpose, they are its reason for existence.\nIn this case, IPAS alleges generally in its complaint that “a significant\nnumber of prisoners committed to the care and custody of [IDOC] have serious\n-11-\n\nmental illnesses that significantly impede their ability to function within the\nprison  environment,”  and  that  IDOC  “provides  insufficient  programs  and\nplacements to treat these prisoners and many are confined in segregation or\nexcessively isolated and harsh conditions which exacerbate their illnesses and\nconditions where they fail to receive adequate mental health care.”  Complaint ¶ 1;\nsee also ¶ 72 (conditions in the segregation units maintained by IDOC create “a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm to the mentally ill prisoners who are confined\nthere, including IPAS’ clients and constituents, and in fact cause them ongoing\nand severe harm”); ¶ 56 (confinement in isolation exacerbates the illnesses of\nprisoners who are mentally ill and is “extremely deleterious” to their mental\nhealth). \nMore specifically, IPAS alleges that mentally ill prisoners in the Residential\nTreatment and Chronic Care Units located at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan\nCity  have  “infrequent  individual  contact  with  mental  health  professionals.”\nComplaint ¶¶ 38, 40, 42-43.  IPAS alleges that prisoners held in the Secure\nMental Health Treatment Unit at the New Castle Correctional Facility are held in\ncells with solid cell doors and must interact with mental health professionals: \nin  short  discussions  at  cell  fronts  which  require  the  prisoner  and\nprofessional to yell at each other through the solid cell door.  This is an\nunsatisfactory and inappropriate mental health intervention inasmuch as\nthere is absolutely no privacy.  Because of the lack of confidentiality, it is\nextremely  difficult  to  accurately  assess  the  prisoner’s  mental  health\nfunctioning,  and  prisoners  do  not  disclose  necessary  information\nconcerning their mental conditions.\n-12-\n\nComplaint ¶ 54; see also ¶¶ 44, 46, 48, 54.  IPAS alleges that the ACT program (a\nbehavior modification program for prisoners in the SMHTU and other IDOC\nfacilities) is not adequate or effective at treating mental illness.  Complaint ¶ 55.\nIPAS alleges that mentally ill prisoners held in the Custody and Control Unit in\nthe Wabash Valley Correctional Facility are often violently removed from their cells\nby armored correctional officers when those prisoners refuse to comply with officer\norders  because  of  their  mental  illnesses.    Complaint  ¶¶  60,  64-65.    These\nallegations of injury are sufficient to show that IPAS brings its suit on behalf of\nmembers of its constituency who, if IPAS’s allegations are taken as true, are\nsuffering actual injury under IDOC’s policies.  IPAS has standing to bring this\nlawsuit.\nIDOC argues that while IPAS complains generally about IDOC procedures\nand policies allegedly harming mentally ill prisoners, it has not identified any\nspecific individuals whose rights actually have been violated and thus has not met\nits constitutional standing requirements.  Def. Reply 3.  The court disagrees.  The\npleading requirement is not heightened for organizations to show standing, even\nunder Hunt.  To meet the first prong of that test, protection and advocacy\norganizations  such  as  IPAS  need  only  allege  injury  to  their  members  or\nconstituents.  Disability Rights Wisconsin, 522 F.3d at 802.  Contrary to IDOC’s\ncontention, the Seventh Circuit does not require that the member or members\nsuffering injury be named – actually, the court stated the opposite.  Disability\nRights Wisconsin, 522 F.3d at 802 (the first Hunt prong “still allows for the\n-13-\n\nmember  on  whose  behalf  the  suit  is  filed  to  remain  unnamed  by  the\norganization”).  IDOC has not pointed to any provision in the PAIMI or the Indiana\nstatutes creating IPAS that could reasonably be read to require that IPAS name\na  specific  individual  in  bringing  suit  to  redress  violations  of  the  rights  of\nindividuals with mental illness.\nIPAS has alleged that its constituents, mentally ill prisoners, are being\nhoused in specific separation units within IDOC’s system and have suffered injury\nas a result of their isolation and limited access to mental health treatment.\nCongress granted IPAS standing by statute, and IPAS has sufficiently pled actual\ninjury to its constituents so as to meet the constitutional requirements of Article\nIII standing under Hunt and Disability Rights Wisconsin.  IDOC’s motion to dismiss\nfor lack of standing must be denied. \nII. Disputes Between State Agencies\nIDOC also moves to dismiss IPAS’s complaint on the ground that it presents\nonly an “intramural” dispute between two state agencies.  Def. Br. 6-7; Def. Reply\n8-10.  The Seventh Circuit has advised in dicta that “federal courts should not get\ninvolved unnecessarily in what may be intramural struggles of state government\neven if invited to do so by one of the contenders.”  Mazanec v. North Judson-San\nPierre School Corp., 763 F.2d 845, 848 (7th Cir. 1985).  And it is difficult to see\nhow  a  case  or  controversy  exists  within  the  meaning  of  Article  III  of  the\n-14-\n\nConstitution if, for example, one state agency sues another and the heads of both\nagencies serve at the pleasure of the governor.  In that scenario, it would be as if\nthe governor were suing himself.\nBut IPAS is not a traditional state agency, and it is independent of the\ngovernor.  IPAS is funded by the federal government under the PAIMI.  It receives\nno  state  funding  and  has  authority  independent  of  the  state  to  “pursue\nadministrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of\nindividuals with mental illness who are receiving care or treatment in the State.”\n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(B); see also Ind. Code § 12-28-1-12(3) (IPAS has legal\nauthority to “provide legal and other advocacy services throughout Indiana to\nindividuals or organizations on matters related to the protection of the legal and\nhuman rights of individuals with a developmental disability, individuals with a\nmental  illness,  and  individuals  who  are  seeking  or  receiving  vocational\nrehabilitation services”).\nThe Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction serves at the\npleasure of the Governor.  IPAS is independent from the Governor.  As Congress\nhas mandated in the PAIMI, IPAS is governed by a multi-member governing board\nconsisting of thirteen individuals.  42 U.S.C. § 10805(c)(1); Ind. Code § 12-28-1-6.\nOf those thirteen people, a minority (four) are appointed by Indiana’s Governor\nand the other nine are appointed by majority vote of the board itself.  Ind. Code\n§ 12-28-1-6(a).  IPAS, then, by both funding and organizational structure, is\n-15-\n\neffectively insulated from direct control by the state’s executive.  Unlike traditional\nstate agencies, IPAS is, by Congressional design and mandate, independent from\npolicy dictates of the state government.  This is not a case in which one state\nagency seeks a larger slice of a limited state budget at the expense of a sister\nagency.  Nor is it a case in which a rogue state agency is attempting to circumvent\nstate policy, nor a case in which one agency reporting to the state’s highest\nexecutive is suing another state agency reporting to the state’s highest executive.\nIPAS has raised an actionable case or controversy against IDOC.\nDefendant IDOC’s motion to dismiss is denied. \nSo ordered.\nDate: July 21, 2009                                                        ___     \nDAVID F.

A significant number of prisoners committed to the care and custody of the \nIndiana Department of Correction have serious mental illnesses that significantly impede \ntheir ability to function within the prison environment.  The Indiana Department of \nCorrection provides insufficient programs and placements to treat these prisoners and \nmany are confined in segregation or excessively isolated and harsh conditions which \nexacerbate their illnesses and conditions where they fail to receive adequate mental health \ncare.  The failure of the Indiana Department of Correction and its agents to adequately \ntreat the prisoners in non-segregated and therapeutic environments violates the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  This action for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief is brought by Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 2 of 21 PageID #: 414\nCommission (“IPAS”) which is empowered and charged by federal law to protect the \nrights  of  mentally  ill  and  developmentally  disabled  individuals  in  Indiana  and  has \nstanding to bring this action on behalf of its numerous clients and constituents who are \nmentally ill prisoners affected by defendant’s unlawful actions and inactions.  It is also \nbrought by three prisoners who suffer from mental illness who bring this action on their \nown behalf and on behalf of a class of those similarly situated. \nJurisdiction, venue, cause of action \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n3.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n4.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation, \nunder color of state law, of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States, as well \nas being brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nthe Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. § 794. \nParties \n6.   Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services (IPAS) is an agency, created under \nState law (Indiana Code § 12-28-1-1, et. seq.) pursuant to Federal mandate, which agency \nis funded through eight separate federal programs to advocate for and protect the rights \nand interests of developmentally disabled individuals, individuals with mental illness, and \nother persons with disabilities.   \n7.  Joshua Harrison is an adult person who is committed to the Indiana Department of \nCorrection and who is currently confined in the Indiana State Prison. \n  2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 3 of 21 PageID #: 415\n8.   Greggory Sims is an adult person who is committed to the Indiana Department of \nCorrection and who is currently confined in the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, \nIndiana. \n9.  James Panozzo is an adult person who is committed to the Indiana Department of \nCorrection and is currently confined in the New Castle Psychiatric Unit in the New Castle \nCorrectional Facility in New Castle, Indiana. \n10.  Defendant Commissioner is the duly appointed head of the Indiana Department of \nCorrection (“DOC”), a state agency which receives federal financial assistance and is a \npublic entity as defined under 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B).   \nClass action allegations \n11.  Plaintiff Harrison, Sims and Panozzo bring this action on their own behalf and on \nbehalf of a class of those similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \n12.   The class is defined as: \nall current and future mentally ill prisoners who are committed to the \nIndiana  Department  of  Correction  and  who  are  housed  in  settings  in \nDepartment of Correction institutions or  in the New Castle Correctional \nFacility that feature extended periods of time in cells, including, but not \nlimited  to,  prisoners  in    disciplinary  segregation,  administrative \nsegregation, or in the New Castle Psychiatric Unit. \n \n13.   As defined, the class meets all the requirement of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure.  Specifically, \n  a   The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \n  exact size will be determined through discovery.  However, it is believed to be in \n  the hundreds. \n \nb.   There are questions of law or fact common to the class − whether their \ntreatment by the Department of Correction violates the Eighth Amendment, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n  3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 4 of 21 PageID #: 416\n \n  c.  The claims of the representative parties are typical of those of the class. \n     \n  d.   The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \n  of the class. \n \n14.  The further requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nare met in this cause in that the defendant, at all times, has acted and has refused to act in \na  manner  generally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n15.   Counsel for plaintiffs are appropriate and adequate attorneys to represent the class \nand should be appointed as attorneys for the class pursuant to Rule 23(g), Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. \nFactual allegations \n  Facts concerning IPAS \n17.  The Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act,  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10801, et seq.,  provides for the establishment and funding of systems within each state \nwhich are designed to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness as \nwell as to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of those with mental illness. \n18.  The federal funding is to be given to independent agencies or organizations which \nhave the capacity to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 10804, 10805. \n19.  The  system  established  by  each  State  to  protect  and  advocate  the  rights  of \nmentally ill individuals must have the authority to “pursue administrative, legal, and other \nappropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State.”  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(B). \n  4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 5 of 21 PageID #: 417\n20.  Pursuant  to  Indiana  law,  Indiana  Code  §  12-28-1-1,  et  seq.,  IPAS  has  been \ndesignated  as  the  protection  and  advocacy  agency  under  both  the  Protection  and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act and the Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act. \n21.  IPAS receives absolutely no State funding. \n22.  IPAS has the legal authority to “[p]rovide legal and other advocacy services \nthroughout Indiana to individuals or organizations on matters related to the protection of \nthe legal and human rights of individuals with a developmental disability . . . [and] \nindividuals with a mental illness.”  IND. CODE §12-28-1-12(3). \n23.  IPAS has the legal authority to “sue and be sued” in its own name.   IND. CODE § \n12-28-1-12(4). \n24.  IPAS has the legal authority to enter into contractual relationships in its own \nname.  Id. \n25.  IPAS has the legal authority to “apply for, solicit, and accept contributions or \ngrants of money, property, or services made by gift, devise, bequest, grant or other means \nfrom any source.”  IND. CODE § 12-28-1-12(5). \n26.  One of IPAS’ primary legal responsibilities is to investigate allegations of abuse \nand neglect involving individuals with mental illness and to advocate for appropriate \ntreatment and programs for such individuals.   IPAS’ legal role is to ensure that their \nlegal and civil rights are provided for and protected; that they are treated with dignity and \nrespect; and that they receive appropriate services to address their needs.  \n27.  IPAS brings this action on behalf of prisoners within the DOC, who are currently \nclients and constituents of IPAS, and who are mentally ill and are confined in segregation \n  5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 6 of 21 PageID #: 418\nor other isolated confinement or seclusion settings, and who are not receiving adequate \ntreatment programs.  \n28.  The prisoner clients and constituents of IPAS in this action, confined within the \nDOC, are confined to “facilities” rendering care and treatment for the mentally ill as that \nterm is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802(3). \n  Facts concerning the levels of confinement within the DOC \n29.  Prisoners who are committed to the Indiana Department of Correction may be \nplaced in, among other places, an array of state institutions which range from minimally \nrestrictive to high security institutions. \n30.  These state institutions are owned, managed and operated by the State of Indiana \nwith the exception of the New Castle Correctional Facility which, although owned by the \nState of Indiana, is operated and managed by the GEO Corporation, a private, for-profit, \ncompany, through a contract with the DOC and the DOC is ultimately in control of the \ncare and custody of its prisoners confined there.  \n31.  The lower security institutions feature dormitory-style housing and tend to house \nprisoners with less violent crimes and shorter criminal histories than those in the higher \nsecurity-level prisons. \n32.  The  higher  security  prisons,  including  Wabash  Valley  Correctional  Facility, \nIndiana State Prison (also known as Michigan City), and Pendleton Correctional Facility, \nhouse many prisoners in cells and have prisoners who, because of their committing \noffense and criminal history, require closer supervision and restrictive security measures. \n  6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 7 of 21 PageID #: 419\n33.  The higher security prisons contain segregation units where prisoners may be \nplaced either for disciplinary reasons for a specific period of time or for indeterminate \nperiods of time if the prisoners are on administrative segregation. \n34.  The DOC also maintains, at the Westville Correctional Facility and the Wabash \nValley Correctional Facility, secure confinement units which are long-term segregation \nunits. \n35.   The DOC has specific policies and administrative procedures that govern both \nadministrative and disciplinary segregation of prisoners. \n36.  By policy and procedure, prisoners who are in segregation will be placed in \nsolitary cells generally for 23 hours each day.   \n37.  They are released from their cells for a minimum of three solitary showers a week \nand for one hour of daily recreation.  Some segregated prisoners receive recreation only 5 \ndays a week.   \n38.  The recreation may be solitary although outdoor recreation may take place in \ncontiguous cages housing other prisoners engaged in outdoor recreation. \n  General facts concerning the treatment of mentally ill prisoners within the DOC \n  system \n \n39.  All  medical  care,  including  mental  health  care,  within  the  DOC,  has  been \ncontracted to a private, for-profit, company, Correctional Medical Services. \n40.   Subsequent to the filing of the original complaint in this cause the DOC made \nchanges in its housing and treatment of some, but not all, of its seriously mentally ill \nprisoners.  \n  7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 8 of 21 PageID #: 420\n41.  At the current time the DOC maintains a unit at Wabash Valley Correctional \nFacility called the Special Needs Unit or SNU that has 134 beds.  The purpose of this unit \nis to provide transition into placement back into general population. \n42.    The DOC also maintains a crisis mental health stabilization unit at the New Castle \nCorrectional Facility for seriously mentally ill prisoner in need of short term care and \ntreatment.  This unit has 32 single cells. \n43.   Also at the New Castle Correctional Facility there is now a 32 cell Chronic Care \nUnit for seriously mentally ill prisoners who are deemed to be so seriously mentally ill \nthat they cannot live independently and successfully perform activities of daily living. \n44.   The  New Castle Correctional Facility also contains 64 single cells reserved for \nseriously mentally ill prisoners who are deemed to be a substantial danger to themselves \nor others. This is now called the Behavioral Achievement Range.  (“BAR”). \n45.   The units housing mentally ill prisoners at the New Castle Correctional Facility \nare known as the New Castle Psychiatric Unit. \n46.   Prisoners in the BAR report that they have infrequent contact with mental health \nstaff. A number may have group therapy once a week and may see a therapist for \nindividual discussions intermittently. \n47.  The prisoners in the BAR are housed behind solid doors which increase their \nfeeling of isolation.   \n48.   They are afforded individual recreation daily for one hour in either an indoor \nsmall cage or in an outdoor cage.   \n49.   They are allowed three showers a week that are supposed to be for 15 minutes.  \nHowever, at times prisoners are locked into the showers for much longer periods of time. \n  8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 9 of 21 PageID #: 421\n50.  The doors to the cells in the BAR are solid doors with a small window and a cuff \nport that is locked from the outside except when it is opened to slide in meals or for the \nprisoner to extend his wrists so he can be cuffed from behind before he leaves the cell. \n51.  The prisoners are fed in their cells. \n52.  When prisoners are removed from their cells they wear leg chains and their hands \nare cuffed.   \n53.  The large majority of interactions between the mentally ill prisoners and mental \nhealth professionals on the BAR take place in short discussions at cell fronts which \nrequire the prisoner and professional to yell at each other through the solid cell door.  \nThis is an unsatisfactory and inappropriate mental health intervention inasmuch as there \nis absolutely no privacy.  Because of the lack of confidentiality, it is extremely difficult to \naccurately assess the prisoner’s mental health functioning, and prisoners do not disclose \nnecessary information concerning their mental conditions. \n54.  Confinement  in  virtual  isolation  exacerbates  the  illnesses  of  those  who  are \nmentally ill and is extremely deleterious to the mental health of mentally ill prisoners.  \n55.  There has recently been at least one suicide and another patient death in the BAR. \n  The continued segregation of mentally ill prisoners \n56.  There are a significant number of seriously mentally ill prisoners within the DOC \nwho are confined in segregation units in various DOC institutions.  \n57.  In these units they are subjected to severe isolation and lack of environmental \nstimulation.  This isolation is extremely detrimental and harmful to the mental health of \nmentally ill persons. \n  9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 10 of 21 PageID #: 422\n58.  In these units the primary, if not sole, contact the prisoners will have with mental \nhealth staff will be brief conversations at their cell doors which, for the reasons indicated \nabove, is wholly inadequate. \n59.  An example of the segregation units to which mentally ill persons are being \nconfined  is  the  Custody  and  Control  Unit  which  is  located  at  the  Wabash  Valley \nCorrectional Facility.  \n60.  There are a significant number of prisoners on this unit who are mentally ill. \n61.  As in all segregation units, those imprisoned in this unit are held in isolation for \n23 hours a day.  They are released for solitary recreation and showers.  \n62.  The prisoners are held behind solid doors which only increases their isolation and \nthe mental health problems flowing from the isolation. \n63.   Mentally ill prisoners on this segregation unit report that they are frequently and \nviolently extracted from their cells by armored correctional officers. \n64.  These violent encounters are often caused by the prisoners’ mental illness when, \nfor example, they engage in such irrational behavior as refusing to “cuff up” so they can \nleave their cells. \n65.  The Westville Control Unit at the Westville Correctional Facility also contains a \nlarge number of seriously mentally ill persons. \n66.  Mentally ill prisoners confined in other segregation units throughout the DOC do \nnot see mental health staff with any frequency.   \nThe named plaintiffs \n  Joshua Harrison \n67.  Joshua Harrison is an adult resident of Indiana. \n \n  10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 11 of 21 PageID #: 423\n68.  He is currently confined in the Indiana State Prison, although he was in Westville \nControl Unit from November of 2008 until October of 2009 for disciplinary segregation. \n69.  He is diagnosed as having an Axis I diagnosis of, among other things, Impulse \nControl disorder, unspecified. \n70.  While at the Westville Control Unit he was released from his cell for five one \nhour solitary recreation periods and five short showers a week.  The rest of the time he \nwas confined to his cell. \n71.  While  at  the  Westville  Control  Unit  he  was  in  the  ACT  Program,  but  was \nremoved from it after he received a disciplinary write-up. However, all that occurred in \nthe ACT program was that he completed worksheets in his cell and handed them in to the \ncorrectional counselor.  He never received any sort of therapy or treatment. \n72.   While  at  the  Westville  Control  Unit,  approximately  every  two  weeks  or  so, \nsomeone from the mental health department would come to his cell front to ask if he was \ndoing OK.  He was never taken out of the cell to talk to a mental health counselor.  It was \nnot possible to have meaningful and therapeutic conversations about his mental health \nissues through his cell door because all other prisoners and staff nearby would be able to \nhear the conversations. \n73.  While at the Westville Control Unit he was prescribed medications for his mental \nillness and approximately every 90 days he was seen by a psychiatrist to review his \nmedications.  He refused his medications because they did not do any good and he was \nnot being allowed to receive the medications that have assisted him in the past. \n74  He has a history of suicidal behavior. \n  11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 12 of 21 PageID #: 424\n75.  The persistent isolation of the Westville Control Unit made his mental health \nconditions worse.  He had visual and auditory hallucinations.  He sat in his cell and \nstressed all day. \n76.   While at the Westville Control Unit he was placed in a strip cell for 24 hours at a \ntime for punishment.  A prisoner placed in this cell is stripped to his shorts.  When he was \nin the strip cell he was not examined by anyone from the institution’s mental health \ndepartment. He was fed sack food of bologna sandwiches for all his meals. \n77.  The Westville Control Unit was an inappropriate placement for him and all other \npersons who are seriously mentally ill.  He is aware that there are many other mentally ill \nprisoners also confined in the isolated environment of the Westville Control Unit. \n78.   His disciplinary segregation is now over and he has been moved to the Indiana \nState Prison and reclassified for Administrative Segregation.   \n79.  He has been in administrative segregation in Michigan City previously and is \naware that in Administrative Segregation he will continue to be isolated in a solitary cell. \n80.   He  understands  that  there  is  no  mental  health  programming  or  treatmentin \nadministrative segregation.  Approximately once a month a mental health professional \nwill walk the range and will talk to prisoners at their cell front to assess their situation \nand condition.  It is not possible to have a meaningful conversation with a therapist in this \nenvironment.  \n81.    The only time he will be out of his cell regularly is for recreation five days a week \nfor approximately one hour and a 15 minute shower 7 days a week.   \n82.  The continued isolation and lack of treatment will make his mental condition \nworsen. \n  12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 13 of 21 PageID #: 425\n83.  He desires to have group therapy and other mental health treatment in a prison \nsetting that does not feature prolonged isolation. \n84.  He has fully exhausted his grievances to challenge the failure to provide him in an \nadequate setting and with adequate treatment as is shown by the attached.  (Exhibit 1). \n  Greggory Sims \n85.  Greggory Sims is an adult resident of Indiana. \n \n86.   He is diagnosed as having an Axis I diagnosis of unspecified psychosis. \n \n85.  He has recently been moved to the Indiana State Prison.  Prior to that he was \nconfined  in  the  Westville  Control  Unit  at  the  Westville  Correctional  Facility  for \ndisciplinary segregation and in other segregated settings within the DOC, including the \nsecure confinement unit at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility which was the subject of \nthe private settlement agreement referred to earlier in this amended complaint. \n87.   While at the Westville Control Unit he was released from his cell for five one \nhour solitary recreation periods and five short showers a week.  The rest of the time he \nwas confined to his cell. \n88.   While at the Westville Control Unit he was, for a period of time, in the ACT \nProgram, but was removed from it after he received a disciplinary write-up. However, all \nthat occurred in the ACT program was that he completed worksheets in his cell and \nhanded them in to the correctional counselor.  He never received any sort of therapy or \ntreatment. \n89   While at the Westville Control Unit periodically, approximately every thirty days \nor so, someone from the mental health department will come to his cell front to ask if he \nwass doing OK.  He was never taken out of the cell to talk to a mental health counselor.  \n  13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 14 of 21 PageID #: 426\nIt was not possible to have meaningful and therapeutic conversations about his mental \nhealth issues through his cell door because all other prisoners and staff nearby would be \nable to hear the conversations. \n90.  He is prescribed medications for his mental illness and approximately every 90 \ndays he is seen by a psychiatrist to review his medications. \n91.  The  persistent  isolation  of  the  segregation  units  he  has  been  in  makes  him \nparanoid and makes his mental health conditions worse. \n92.   The Westville Control Unit was an inappropriate placement for him and all other \npersons who are seriously mentally ill.  He is aware that there are many other mentally ill \nprisoners also confined in the isolated environment of the Westville Control Unit. \n93.  He was recently transferred to the Indiana State Prison and has been classified to \nbe placed in administrative segregation..   \n94.    He has been placed into administrative segregation in Michigan City previously \nand is aware of the conditions there. \n95.   In administrative segregation prisoners are in solitary cells \n96.   He will be allowed out for recreation and a shower five days a week for 75 \nminutes and for another two days will be allowed out for a short period of time during \nwhich he can take a shower.. \n97.   On administrative segregation he and the other prisoners are not afforded any \nregular mental health treatment.  Approximately every 30 days someone from the mental \nhealth department will come to prisoners’ cell fronts and inquire as to their mental status.  \nThese are brief conversations only and, as indicated above, it is not possible to have \n  14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 15 of 21 PageID #: 427\nmeaningful and therapeutic conversations about his mental health issues through his cell \ndoor because all other prisoners and staff nearby will be able to hear the conversations. \n98.  He desires to have group therapy and other mental health treatment in a prison \nsetting that does not feature prolonged isolation. \n99.  In 2007, shortly after he was placed into the Westville Control Unit, he filed a \ngrievance challenging his placement and requesting that he be moved to a place where he \ncan obtain treatment.  The grievance was denied and is fully exhausted.  The grievance is \nattached. (Exhibit 2).  He has exhausted all available grievances. \n  James Panozzo \n100.   James Panozzo is an adult resident of Indiana. \n101.  He is currently confined in the BAR in the New Castle Psychiatric Unit at the \nNew Castle Correctional Facility. \n102.  He has been diagnosed in the past as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia as \nwell  as  schizo-affective  disorder.    He  is  currently  diagnosed  as  having  antisocial \npersonality disorder as well as borderline personality disorder. \n103.  He has been confined in the New Castle Psychiatric Unit since October of 2008. \n104.  He  was  confined  to  the  secure  housing  unit  at  Wabash  Valley  Correctional \nFacility for many years. \n105.  Although he has previously been on anti-psychotic medications, the have been \ndiscontinued by the psychiatrist at New Castle. \n106.  He has frequent auditory hallucinations and sometimes has visual hallucinations. \n107.  He has a history of injuring himself and has suicidal thoughts. \n108.  He is very depressed and often does not eat for days. \n  15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 16 of 21 PageID #: 428\n109.  Although he is supposed to be in a setting that treats his serious mental illness, he \nreceives little treatment at New Castle. \n110.  He is supposed to be in group therapy once a week with two other prisoners.  \nHowever, the sessions are often cancelled. \n111.  He  is  also  taken  out  of  his  cell  to  speak  individually  to  a  mental  health \nprofessional.    This  does  not  occur  frequently.  He  last  met  with  someone  in  early \nSeptember. \n112.  He is confined to a small solitary cell except for an hour of recreation each day \nand  three  showers  a  week.    The  showers  are  only  supposed  to  be  for  15  minutes.  \nHowever, sometimes the guards leave prisoners in the showers for hours.   \n113.  The persistent isolation makes his mental condition worsen.  \n114.  As discipline prisoners may be served nutraloaf instead of regular food.  This is  a \nfood substance made by cooking vegetables together so they form a block.  All the \nprisoners receive for their meals is a portion of nutraloaf and two pieces of bread.  He \nwas fed nutraloaf as punishment for two weeks. \n115.  Mr.  Panozzo  attempted  to  file  a  grievance  concerning  his  placement.    His \ngrievance and the response is attached. (Exhibit 3).  He attempted to appeal this but was \ninformed by the staff person who is responsible for grievances, David Ittenbach, that he \nwas not going to assign Mr. Panozzo an appeal number because it was a waste of time. \nHe was therefore not able to appeal the matter further.  \n116  He has exhausted all grievance remedies that are available to him. \n117.  The New Castle Correctional Facility is an inappropriate placement for him and \nall other persons who are seriously mentally ill.   \n  16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 17 of 21 PageID #: 429\n118.  He desires to have mental health treatment in a prison setting that does not feature \nprolonged isolation. \n  General factual allegations \n119.  IPAS represents as clients and constituents severely mentally ill prisoners who are \nplaced in segregation throughout the DOC as well as in the BAR. \n120.  The segregation units as well as the BAR into which the DOC has placed the \nseriously  mentally  prisoners,  feature  severe  social  isolation,  lack  of  environmental \nstimulation, and lack of frequent contact with mental health staff and cause psychological \ndeterioration of the prisoners confined there. \n121.  These conditions create a substantial risk of serious harm to the mentally ill \nprisoners who are confined there, including plaintiffs, the putative class, and IPAS’ \nclients and constituents, and in fact cause them ongoing and severe harm. \n122.  These conditions deprive mentally ill prisoners, including plaintiffs, the putative \nclass, and IPAS’ clients and constituents, of the minimal civilized measure of life’s \nnecessities. \n123.  The psychological and mental health needs of these prisoners, including plaintiffs, \nthe putative class, and IPAS’ clients and constituents, represent a serious medical need \nand the exacerbation of their illnesses and conditions due to the conditions of their \nconfinement also constitutes a serious medical need. \n124.  Despite prior litigation which highlighted the danger of confining mentally ill \nprisoners in 23 hour-a-day isolation, the defendant continues to do so and has failed to \nprovide adequate mental health care for persons so confined, including plaintiffs, the \nputative class, and IPAS’ clients and constituents. \n  17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 18 of 21 PageID #: 430\n125.  The defendant is aware of the risk of harm caused by this form of confinement \nand is deliberately indifferent to it. \n126.  The prolonged isolated confinement of mentally ill persons, including plaintiffs, \nthe putative class, and IPAS’ clients and constituents, causes severe harm and defendant, \nat all times, has been aware of this fact. \n127.  The defendant has not reasonably accommodated the mentally ill prisoners in \nsegregated and isolated conditions, including plaintiffs, the putative class, and IPAS’ \nclients and constituents, by providing appropriate treatment in non-segregated and non-\nisolated environments. \n128.  Providing such an accommodation would not be a fundamental alteration in the \nservices provided by the DOC. \n129.  The  continued  confinement  of  mentally  ill  prisoners,  including  plaintiffs,  the \nputative  class,  and  IPAS’  clients  and  constituents,  in  the  segregated  and  isolated \nconditions noted above, and without appropriate treatment, is causing them irreparable \nharm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n130.  The mentally ill prisoners confined within the DOC, including plaintiffs, the \nputative  class,  and  IPAS’  clients  and  constituents,  are  qualified  individuals  with  a \ndisability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(2), \n12131(2), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Specifically, they have mental \nimpairments that substantially limit one or more of the major life activities, as well as \nhaving records of having such impairments and further are regarded as having such \nimpairments.   \n  18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 19 of 21 PageID #: 431\n131.  As qualified individuals with disabilities, the mentally ill prisoners within the \nDOC, including plaintiffs, the putative class, and IPAS’ clients and constituents, meet the \nessential  eligibility  requirements  for  the  receipt  of  services  or  the  participation  in \nactivities provided by defendant. \n132.  At all times defendant has acted under color of state law. \nLegal claims \n133.  The  continued  confinement  of  mentally  ill  prisoners,  including  plaintiffs,  the \nputative  class,  and  IPAS’  clients  and  constituents,  in  the  segregated  and  isolated \nconditions noted above, and without adequate and appropriate mental health care and \ntreatment,  violates  the  rights  of  the  prisoners  to  be  free  from  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as \nmade applicable to the State of Indiana by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. \n134.  Defendant  has  discriminated  against  the  mentally  ill  prisoners,  including \nplaintiffs,  the  putative  class,  and  IPAS’  clients  and  constituents,  in  segregated  and \nisolated confinement throughout the DOC by failing to provide non-segregated and non-\nisolated housing and increased treatment as a reasonable accommodation to prevent \nconfinement conditions which exacerbate the prisoners’ mental illnesses.  This represents \ndiscrimination against these prisoners in violation of both the Rehabilitation Act and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  29 U.S.C. § 794, 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nRequest for relief \n  WHEREFORE, the individual plaintiffs and IPAS, on behalf of the mentally ill \nprisoners who are its clients and constituents, request that this Court: \n  19\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 81   Filed 12/02/09   Page 20 of 21 PageID #: 432\na.

Thomas’ Motion for Leave to Proceed on\nAppeal In Forma Pauperis. (Dkt. No. 169). Fo r the reasons stated below, the Motion in\nDenied.\nMr. Thomas, a non-party to this matter isa  state prisoner who filed a Motion to have\na 3-judge panel convened to adjudicate his claims (Dkt. No. 165). His Motion was denied\nbecause Thomas is not a party to the case and the circumstances warranting a 3-judge\npanel were not presented. Mr. Thomas has ifled an appeal from this ruling. The appeal has\nbeen docketed as No. 11-1504 and the short record on appeal has been prepared and\ntransmitted. \nAn appeal may not be taken  in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies t hat the\nappeal is not taken in good faith.  28 U.S.C. § 1915; see Coppedge v. United States, 369\nU.S. 438 (1962). \"Good faith within the meaning of § 1915 mus tbe judged by an objective,\nnot a subjective, standard.  Id. There is no objectively reasonable argument which Mr.\nThomas could present to argue that r esolution of his motion for a 3-judge panel was\nerroneous. Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), a prisoner is ineligible to\nproceed in forma pauperis  based on his prior civliilt igation history in filing actions that were\ndismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim. The order in question is not\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 170   Filed 03/28/11   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 847\nappealable at this time and Mr. Thomas has “struck out” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g)1.\nThis latter factor renders Mr. Thomas ineligible to proceed in forma pauperis. In pursuing\nan appeal, therefore, Mr. Thomas “is acting in bad faith . . . [because] to sue in bad faith\nmeans merely to sue on the basis of a frivolous claim, which is to say a claim that no\nreasonable person could suppose to have any merit.”L ee v. Clinton, 209 F.3d 1025, 1026\n(7th Cir. 2000).\nBased on the foregoing, Mr. Thomas’  request for leave to proceed on appeal  in\nforma pauperis (Dkt.

Assuming for the \npresent that he is, however, his motion to  commute his sentence from an Indiana state \ncourt does not establish that he is entitled t o relief. More specifically, he alleges in his \nmotion  that the particular circumstances   of his confinement violate the Eighth \nAmendment’s proscription against the imposition of cruel  and unusual punishment and \nthat Indiana is unable to care for his myriad physical and mental health needs.  \n  It would be exc eptional for a federal cour t to determine that  release of a state \ninmate is compelled by the circumstances of his confinement. It has occurred recently , \nas the parties are aware, in Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1930-31 (2011)(confirming \nthat  injunctive relief may  be  instituted only as “nec essary  to correct a current and \nongoing violation” (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626), but the court has  not concluded that there \nis a constitutional violation associated with the plaintiffs’ claims and has not ordered any \n\nparticular relief, much less that specific inm ates or that inmates with particular profiles \nbe  released. Such an order, moreover, w ould  not negate or modify an inmate’s  \nsentence.  \n  For the reasons explained above, therefore, Mr. Jeffers is not entitled to the relief \nsought in his motion to commute sentence, and that motion [Dkt. 249] is denied. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n10/31/2011  \nDate: ___________________              \n                 \n     ________________________ \n      Hon.

A  significant number of prisoners  committed to  the  care  and  custody of the \nIndiana Department of Correction have serious mental illnesses that significantly impede \ntheir ability to  function  within the prison  environment.  The Indiana Department of \nCorrection provides insufficient programs and placements to treat these prisoners and \nmany are confined in segregation or excessively isolated and harsh conditions which \nexacerbate their illnesses and conditions where they fail to receive adequate mental health \ncare.  The failure of the Indiana Department of Correction and its agents to adequately \ntreat the prisoners in non-segregated and therapeutic environments violates the Eighth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 794.  This action for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief is brought by Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services \nCommission (\"IPAS\") which is empowered and charged by federal  law to protect the \nrights  of mentally  ill  and  developmentally  disabled  individuals  in  Indiana  and  has \n\n•  • \nstanding to bring this action on behalf of its numerous clients and constituents who are \nmentally  ill  prisoners  affected  by  defendant's  unlawful  actions  and  inactions \nJurisdiction, venue, cause of action \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n3.  Declaratory reliefis authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n4.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation, \nunder color of state law, of rights secured by the Constitution ofthe United States, as well \nas being brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nthe Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. § 794. \nParties \n6.  Indiana Protection and Advocacy Services (IP AS) is an agency, created under \nState law (Indiana Code § 12-28-1-1, et. seq.) pursuant to Federal mandate, which agency \nis funded through eight separate federal programs to advocate for and protect the rights \nand interests of developmentally disabled individuals, individuals with mental illness, and \nother persons with disabilities. \n7.  Defendant Commissioner is the duly appointed head of the Indiana Department of \nCorrection (\"DOC\"), a state agency which receives federal financial assistance and is a \npublic entity as defined under 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B). \nFactual allegations \nFacts concerning IPAS \n8.  The Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act,  42 U.S.C. \n§ 10801, et seq.,  provides for the establishment and funding of systems within each state \n2 \n\n•  • \nwhich are designed to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness as \nwell as to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of those with mental illness. \n9.  The federal funding is to be given to independent agencies or organizations which \nhave the capacity to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 10804, 10805. \n10.  The  system  established  by  each  State  to  protect  and  advocate  the  rights  of \nmentally ill individuals must have the authority to \"pursue administrative, legal, and other \nappropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are \nreceiving care or treatment in the State.\" 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(B). \n11.  Pursuant to  Indiana  law,  Indiana  Code  §  12-28-1-1,  et seq.,  IPAS  has  been \ndesignated  as  the  protection  and  advocacy  agency  under  both  the  Protection  and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act and the Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act. \n12.  IPAS receives absolutely no State funding. \n13.  IP AS  has  the  legal  authority to  \"[p ]rovide legal  and  other advocacy  services \nthroughout Indiana to individuals or organizations on matters related to the protection of \nthe  legal and human rights  of individuals with  a developmental  disability . . . [and] \nindividuals with a mental illness.\"  IND. CODE §12-28-1-12(3). \n14.  IPAS has the legal authority to \"sue and be sued\" in its own name.  IND. CODE § \n12-28-1-12(4). \n15.  IPAS  has the legal  authority to  enter into  contractual relationships in its  own \nname.  Id. \n3 \n\n•  • \n16.  IP AS has the legal authority to \"apply for,  solicit, and accept contributions or \ngrants of money, property, or services made by gift, devise, bequest, grant or other means \nfrom any source.\"  IND. CODE § 12-28-1-12(5). \n17.  One of IP AS' primary legal responsibilities is to investigate allegations of abuse \nand neglect involving individuals with mental illness and to  advocate for appropriate \ntreatment and programs for such individuals.  IP AS' legal role is to ensure that their \nlegal and civil rights are provided for and protected; that they are treated with dignity and \nrespect; and that they receive appropriate services to address their needs. \n18.  IP AS brings this action on behalf of prisoners within the DOC, who are currently \nclients and constituents of IP AS, and who are mentally ill and are confined in segregation \nor other isolated confinement or seclusion settings, and who are not receiving adequate \ntreatment programs. \n19.  The prisoner clients and constituents of IPAS in this action, confined within the \nDOC, are confined to \"facilities\" rendering care and treatment for the mentally ill as that \nterm is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 10802(3). \nFacts concerning the levels ofc onfinement within the DOC \n20.  Prisoners who are committed to the Indiana Department of Correction may be \nplaced in, among other places, an array of state institutions which range from minimally \nrestrictive to high security institutions. \n21.  These state institutions are owned, managed and operated by the State of Indiana \nwith the exception of the New Castle Correctional Facility which, although owned by the \nState of Indiana, is operated and managed by the GEO Corporation, a private, for-profit, \n4 \n\n•  • \ncompany through a contract with the DOC and the DOC is ultimately in control of the \ncare and custody of its prisoners confined there. \n22.  The lower security institutions feature dormitory-style housing and tend to house \nprisoners with less violent crimes and shorter criminal histories than those in the higher \nsecurity-level prisons. \n23.  The  higher  security  prisons,  including  Wabash  Valley  Correctional  Facility, \nIndiana State Prison (also known as Michigan City), and Pendleton Correctional Facility, \nhouse many prisoners in cells  and have prisoners who,  because of their committing \noffense and criminal history, require closer supervision and restrictive security measures. \n24.  The higher security prisons contain segregation units where prisoners may be \nplaced either for disciplinary reasons for a specific period of time or for indeterminate \nperiods of time if the prisoners are on administrative segregation. \n25.  The DOC also maintains, at the Westville Correctional Facility and the Wabash \nValley Correctional Facility, secure confinement units which are long-term segregation \nunits. \n26.  The DOC has specific policies and administrative procedures that govern both \nadministrative and disciplinary segregation of prisoners. \n27.  By policy and  procedure,  prisoners  who  are  segregation will be placed in \nIII \nsolitary cells generally for 23 hours each day. \n28.  They are released from their cells for a minimum of three solitary showers a week \nand for one hour of daily recreation.  Some segregated prisoners receive recreation only 5 \ndays a week. \n5 \n\n•  • \n29.  The recreation may be solitary although outdoor recreation may take place in \ncontiguous cages housing other prisoners engaged in outdoor recreation. \nGeneral facts concerning the treatment of mentally ill prisoners within the DOC \nsystem \n30.  All  medical  care,  including  mental  health  care,  within  the  DOC,  has  been \ncontracted to a private, for-profit, company, Correctional Medical Services. \n31.  The DOC has a Mental Health Services Plan for Adult Offenders that provides, \namong other things, for services for prisoners who are diagnosed with \"mental illness,\" \n\"serious mental illness,\" or a \"developmental disability.\" \n32.  The above terms are defined as follows by the DOC: \n-mental illness:  \"Axis I disorder, exclusive of Substance Abuse/Dependence of \nParaphilia, with a OAF score above 40.\" \n-serious  mental  illness:  \"Axis  I  disorder,  exclusive  of  Substance \nAbuse/Dependency of Paraphilia, with a OAF score of 40 or below.\" \n33.  An Axis I disorder refers to  the listing of mental  disorders maintained in the \nDIAGNOSTIC AND  STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL  DISORDERS,  a handbook used by \nmental health professionals. \n34.  The  OAF  score  is  the  global  assessment  of functioning  scale,  a  subjective \nmeasure  of the  patient's  overall  level  of psychological,  social,  and  occupational \nfunctioning on a hypothetical continuum from 0 (the lowest) to 100 (the highest). \n35.  Because the OAF score is a subjective impression of the person's functioning at \nthe moment he is seen by a clinician, it has no direct bearing on the severity of a mental \nimpairment.  In  fact,  the  Commissioner  of the  Social  Security  Administration  has \nspecifically indicated that the OAF score has no direct correlation to the mental disorder \n6 \n\n•  • \nlistings utilized to evaluate a person's disability.  65 Fed. Reg. 50746, 50764-65 (Aug. \n21,2000). \n36.  The GAF score is of limited use in a prison setting inasmuch as it is supposed to \nmeasure,  among other things,  social  and occupational functioning,  both of which are \nseverely restricted or nonexistent in the prison setting. \nThe residential treatment and chronic care units at Michigan City \n37.  Pursuant to a private settlement agreement entered into in the case of Mast v. \nDonahue, No.  2:05-CV-037 LJM/WGH (U.S. Dist. Ct. - So. Dist. of Ind.), the DOC has \nagreed not to house any prisoner with an Axis I diagnosis within the secure confinement \nunit at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. \n38.  In 2007 the DOC opened up two units at Michigan City to house mentally ill \nprisoners. \n39.  One of these is called the RTU or Residential Treatment Unit and is designed to \nhouse up to 66 prisoners in a program designed to transition them to regular housing. \n40.  On  information  and  belief,  prisoners  in  the  RTU  have  infrequent  individual \ncontact with mental health professionals, although they are allowed out of their cells for \nthree hours each day. \n41.  Prisoners in the RTU have reported that there have been two suicides by prisoners \nconfined there. \n42.  The other unit at Michigan City is the Chronic Care Unit, which is a long-term \nunit for mentally ill prisoners who are not expected to return to general population within \nthe DOC. \n7 \n\n•  • \n43.  Prisoners  confined to  the Chronic  Care Unit report that they have infrequent \ncontact with mental health staff, although they are allowed out of their cells multiple \nhours each day. \nThe secure mental health treatment unit at New Castle \n44.  In the summer of 2008 the DOC opened a new unit at New Castle Correctional \nFacility,  the Secure Mental Health Treatment Unit (SMHTU),  for prisoners who  fall \nwithin the DOC's definition of Seriously Mentally III and who are subject to segregation \nin the DOC. \n45.  There are 96 beds available at the SMHTU, but at the current time the DOC is \nplanning only to fill 67 of them. \n46.  Prisoners at the SMHTU are housed in individual cells behind solid doors. \n47.  Although the DOC does not consider SMHTU to be a segregation unit, prisoners \nare left in their cells 23 hours a day, with one hour individual recreation.  Three times a \nweek the prisoners are also released for a solitary shower. \n48.  The doors to the cells in the SMHTU are solid doors with a small window and a \ncuff port that is locked from the outside except when it is opened to slide in meals or for \nthe prisoner to extend his wrists so they can be cuffed from behind before he leaves the \ncell. \n49.  The prisoners are fed in their cells. \n50.  Because the doors are solid the prisoners have no way of seeing other prisoners. \n51.  Recreation  either  takes  place  indoors  in  a  small  barred  area  that  has  been \nconstructed for the prisoners in a day room that prisoners formerly had access to or in one \nof a number of cages constructed outside. \n8 \n\n•  • \n52.  If a prisoner elects to take a shower he is cuffed and then escorted to the shower \nwhere he may be left for an extended period of time. \n53.  When prisoners are removed from their cells they wear leg chains and their hands \nare cuffed.  A leash is connected to the leg chains and they are escorted by guards. \n54.  The large majority of interactions between the mentally ill prisoners and mental \nhealth professionals on the SMHTU take place in short discussions at cell fronts which \nrequire the prisoner and professional to  yell at each other through the solid cell door. \nThis is an unsatisfactory and inappropriate mental health intervention inasmuch as there \nis absolutely no privacy.  Because ofthe lack of confidentiality, it is extremely difficult to \naccurately assess the prisoner's mental health functioning, and prisoners do not disclose \nnecessary information concerning their mental conditions. \n55.  The  major  programming  planned  for  prisoners  in  the  SMHTU  is  the  ACT \nprogram, present in other locations within the DOC, which is a behavior modification \nprogram where the prisoner, in his cell, views recordings broadcast via closed circuit \ntelevision  and  completes  worksheets  which  he  returns,  not  to  a  mental  health \nprofessional, but to his correctional counselor.  As  the person progresses through the \nprogram he will  earn  first  some,  and then more,  commissary privileges.  It is not a \nprogram that will adequately and effectively treat mental illness. \n56.  Confinement  in  virtual  isolation  exacerbates  the  illnesses  of those  who  are \nmentally ill and is extremely deleterious to the mental health of mentally ill prisoners. \nThe continued segregation of mentally ill prisoners \n9 \n\n•  • \n57.  After all the prisoners who the DOC plans to move out of segregation units into \nthe SMHTU are moved, there will  still be more than 230 prisoners who have Axis I \ndiagnoses who will be confined in segregation units within the DOC. \n58.  In these units they will be subjected to severe isolation and lack of environmental \nstimulation.  This isolation is extremely detrimental and harmful to the mental health of \nmentally ill persons. \n59.  In these units the primary, if not sole, contact the prisoners will have with mental \nhealth staff will be brief conversations at their cell doors which, for the reasons indicated \nabove, is wholly inadequate. \n60.  An example of the  segregation units  to  which mentally ill persons  are being \nconfined  is  the  Custody  and  Control  Unit  which  is  located  at  the  Wabash  Valley \nCorrectional Facility. \n61.  There are a significant number of prisoners on this unit who are mentally ill. \n62.  As in all segregation units, those imprisoned in this unit are held in isolation for \n23 hours a day.  They are released for solitary recreation and showers. \n63.  The prisoners are held behind solid doors which only increases their isolation and \nthe mental health problems flowing from the isolation. \n64.  Mentally ill prisoners on this segregation unit report that they are frequently and \nviolently extracted from their cells by armored correctional officers. \n65.  These violent encounters are often caused by the prisoners' mental illness when, \nfor example, they engage in such irrational behavior as refusing to \"cuff up\" so they can \nleave their cells. \nlO \n\n•  • \n66.  Prisoners, including mentally ill prisoners, who are deemed to have misbehaved \nin the Custody and Control Unit are punished by being placed in strip cells for 21  days. \nThe prisoners are stripped of most of their clothing but have it returned to them over time \nif their behavior improves. \n67.  However, during the entire 21 day period the prisoners are fed \"nutraloaf,\" which \nis a food substance made by cooking vegetables together so they form a block.  All the \nprisoners receive for their meals is a portion of nutraloaf and two pieces of bread. \n68.  On information  and  belief there  have,  recently,  been a number of attempted \nsuicides in this unit. \n69.  Mentally ill prisoners confined in other segregation units throughout the DOC do \nnot see mental health staffwith any frequency. \nGeneral factual allegations \n70.  IP AS represents as clients and constituents severely mentally ill prisoners who are \nplaced in segregation throughout the DOC as well as in the SMHTU. \n71.  The segregation units as well as the SMHTU into which the DOC has placed the \nmore than  300 prisoners,  including IP AS'  clients and  constituents,  who have Axis  I \ndiagnoses or are otherwise seriously mentally ill, feature severe social isolation, lack of \nenvironmental  stimulation,  and  lack  of frequent  contact with mental health staff and \ncause psychological deterioration of the prisoners confined there. \n72.  These conditions  create  a substantial risk  of serious harm  to  the mentally ill \nprisoners who are confined there, including IP AS' clients and constituents, and in fact \ncause them ongoing and severe harm. \n11 \n\n•  • \n• \n73.  These  conditions  deprive  mentally  ill prisoners,  including  IP AS'  clients  and \nconstituents, ofthe minimal civilized measure oflife's necessities. \n74.  The psychological and mental health needs of these prisoners, including IPAS' \nclients and constituents, represent a serious medical need and the exacerbation of their \nillnesses and conditions due to  the conditions of their confinement also  constitutes a \nserious medical need. \n75.  Despite prior litigation which highlighted the danger of confining mentally ill \nprisoners in 23 hour-a-day isolation, the defendant continues to do so and has failed to \nprovide adequate mental health care for persons so confined, including IP AS' clients and \nconstituents. \n76.  The defendant is aware of the risk of harm caused by this form of confinement \nand is deliberately indifferent to it. \n77.  The prolonged  isolated  confinement  of mentally ill persons,  including  IP AS' \nclients and constituents, causes severe harm and defendant, at all times, has been aware \nof this fact. \n78.  The defendant has not reasonably accommodated the mentally ill prisoners in \nsegregated and isolated conditions, including IP AS' clients and constituents, by providing \nappropriate treatment in non-segregated and non-isolated environments. \n79.  The continued confinement of mentally ill prisoners, including IP AS' clients and \nconstituents,  in  the  segregated  and  isolated  conditions  noted  above,  and  without \nappropriate treatment, is causing them irreparable harm for which there is no adequate \nremedy at law. \n12 \n\n•  • \n• \n80.  The mentally ill prisoners confined within the DOC, including IP AS' clients and \nconstituents, are qualified individuals as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n42  U.S.c.  §§  12102(2),  12131(2),  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act,  29  U.S.C.  §  794. \nSpecifically, they have mental impairments that substantially limit one or more of the \nmajor life activities, as well as having records of having such impairments and further are \nregarded as having such impairments. \n81.  As qualified individuals  with disabilities, the mentally ill prisoners within the \nDOC, including IP AS' clients and constituents, meet the essential eligibility requirements \nfor the receipt of services or the participation in activities provided by defendant. \n82.  At all times defendant has acted under color of state law. \nLegal claims \n83.  The continued confinement of mentally ill prisoners, including IP AS' clients and \nconstituents, in the segregated and isolated conditions noted above, and without adequate \nand appropriate mental health care and treatment, violates the rights of the prisoners to be \nfree from cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution as made applicable to the State of Indiana by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n84.  Defendant has discriminated against the mentally ill prisoners, including IP AS' \nclients and constituents, in segregated and isolated confinement throughout the DOC by \nfailing to provide non-segregated and non-isolated housing and increased treatment as a \nreasonable  accommodation  to  prevent  confinement  conditions  which  exacerbate  the \nprisoners'  mental illnesses.  This  represents  discrimination against these prisoners in \n13 \n\n•  • \nviolation of both the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  29 \nu.S.c. § 794,42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nRequest for relief \nWHEREFORE, plaintiff, on behalf of the mentally ill prisoners who are its clients \nand constituents, requests that this Court: \na.  Accept jurisdiction  of this  case  and  set it for  hearing  at  the  earliest \nopportunity. \nb.

Consistent with the PSA the Indiana Department of Correction (“DOC”) has instituted \nthe policy and practice that prisoners identified as seriously mentally ill, as defined by the PSA, \nare not housed in restrictive housing for more than 30 consecutive days unless: 1) as allowed by \nparagraph 32 of the PSA, the DOC concludes that there are present “exceptional circumstances” \nwhere removing the prisoner from restrictive housing would pose an unacceptable risk to safety \nor security, or 2) as noted by paragraph 33 of the PSA, the prisoner refuses to leave restrictive \nhousing and the DOC determines that it would cause more harm than benefit to the prisoner to \nforce his or her removal. \n2.   The DOC produced a document listing the seriously mentally ill prisoners meeting the \nabove exceptions, effective September 1, 2016.  The document shows that as of that date there \nwere: \n \n~ 1 ~\n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 522   Filed 10/18/16   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 9145\n  12 seriously mentally ill prisoners in segregation-like housing because their removal from \n  such housing was believed to pose an unacceptable risk of danger to themselves or to \n  others; \n \n  4  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoners  in  segregation-like  housing  who  had  consented  in \n  writing to such housing;   \n \n  21 seriously mentally ill prisoners who were scheduled to remain in segregation-like \n  housing  for  30  or  fewer  days.  Prisoners  in  this  group  would  be  removed  from \n  segregation-like housing on or before the 31st day unless either they consented in writing \n  to remain there or their removal was believed at that time to pose an unacceptable risk of \n  danger to themselves or to others. \n \n3.   The mental health placements identified in the PSA for seriously mentally ill prisoners, \nthe New Castle Psychiatric Facility, the Special Needs Unit at Wabash Valley Correctional \nFacility, and the Pendleton Treatment Unit at the Pendleton Correctional Facility are all fully \noperational for male prisoners as described in paragraph 23 of the PSA. \n4.   In all of the above treatment units the prisoners are offered at least 10 hours a week of \ntherapeutic programming out of cell, not including the time out of cell for recreation, showers, or \nother purposes permitted generally to prisoners.  \n5.   After concerns were raised by prisoners concerning both the programming and housing at \nthe Pendleton Treatment Unit, plaintiffs’ counsel were allowed to tour the Unit on August 24, \n2016. At that time the Unit had a population of 161 prisoners. \n6.   Plaintiffs’ counsel received information from the DOC showing that the ten-hour weekly \ntherapeutic programming standard is generally being met.  \n7.   Complaints  had  been  raised  by  prisoners  that  the  therapeutic  programming  in  the \nPendleton Treatment Unit, which primarily features group meetings, was repetitive and did not \nadequately address mental health needs.  During the tour staff explained the nature of the groups \nand discussed planned expansion of the types of therapy offered. \n \n~ 2 ~\n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 522   Filed 10/18/16   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 9146\n8.   Complaints had been raised that prisoners in the Treatment Unit may, for disciplinary \nreasons, be placed into a disciplinary area within the Treatment Unit where they will not receive \nthe 10 hours of programming.  However, counsel did tour this area, in C-Building, and were \ninformed that the prisoners are released from their cells and have the opportunity to meet and \nwork with a clinician, in a small group, for at least 12 hours a week, although the prisoners may \nbe cuffed during the sessions. \n9.  Prisoners in the Treatment Unit had also complained that the non-therapeutic time out of \ntheir  cells  had  been  greatly  reduced  since  the  Unit  opened.    The  DOC  has  indicated  that \nunstructured out-of-cell time has posed a security concern in the past and this has led to a \nreduction in out-of-cell free time.  The DOC has determined that the best approach, consistent \nwith safety and security, is to increase out-of-cell time for the Treatment Unit prisoners as they \nprogress through the levels of the program.  The prisoners progress from being allowed out for 2 \nhours a day, not including recreation and therapy, in A-Building to prisoners in E-Building, the \nfinal level, being allowed out of their cells from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., except during count time or \nemergencies.  The prisoners in C-Building who are on some sort of disciplinary hold are allowed \nout for daily recreation in separate enclosures and also allowed out twice a day, for 15 minutes, \nto access a kiosk where they can send and receive e-messages or have an electronic visit. \nDefendant observes there is no minimum non-therapeutic time out of cell required under the \nPSA. \n10.   Plaintiffs’ counsel have not, post-PSA implementation, toured the other mental health \nunits, New Castle Psychiatric Unit and the Special Needs Unit at Wabash Valley Correctional \nFacility, but the DOC’s attorneys have indicated that the 10-hour minimum weekly therapeutic \nstandard is being met in those areas as well, with rare but occasional exceptions. \n \n~ 3 ~\n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 522   Filed 10/18/16   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 9147\n11.   The DOC is implementing a new program, entitled SNAP (Special Need Acclimation \nProgram), in many of its institutions. This is not specifically a mental health program but is for \ngeneral population prisoners who need additional support. However, it is serving as a step-down \nprogram for some prisoners leaving the mental health units. The defendant observes that this \nprogram is not required under the PSA and will not involve prisoners housed in the New Castle \nPsychiatric  Facility,  the  Special  Needs  Unit  at  Wabash  Valley  Correctional  Facility,  the \nPendleton Treatment Unit at the Pendleton Correctional Facility or female prisoners in restrictive \nstatus housing. \n12.   The above programs are for male prisoners.  Consistent with paragraph 42 of the PSA, \nfemale seriously mentally ill prisoners  remain  housed in the restrictive housing unit at the \nIndiana Women’s Prison, but are released from their cells for at least 10 hours of therapeutic \nprogramming each week. \n13.   Plaintiffs’  counsel,  as  well  as  the  Court,  continue  to  receive  correspondence  from \nprisoners complaining of numerous matters relating specifically to the PSA and more generally \nto the treatment of mentally ill prisoners within the DOC.  When appropriate, counsel will \ncontact attorneys for the DOC to attempt to resolve issues that arise and the parties continue to \ncommunicate often. \n14.   Upon request the DOC has continued to allow plaintiffs’ counsel to review medical \nrecords and has responded to inquiries from counsel when inquiries are prompted by the records. \n15.   The parties believe that both sides are continuing to work to ensure that the terms of the \nPSA are met. \n  WHEREFORE, the parties file their Joint Status report.  \nFor the plaintiffs: \n \n~ 4 ~\n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 522   Filed 10/18/16   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 9148\n \n              s/ Kenneth J.

Counsel  and  representatives  of  the  Indiana  Department  of  Correction  (DOC)  and \nWexford Health Services, the new medical provider for the DOC, met on June 14, 2017, to \ndiscuss the status of the PSA. \n2.   Although  Wexford  is  the  new  medical  provider  it  has  kept  the  same  mental  health \nprofessionals in place in the institutions. Additionally, Wexford has approved the hiring of 23 \naddiction-recovery specialists who will be used throughout the DOC. \n3.  Consistent with the PSA the DOC has instituted and continues to follow the policy and \npractice that prisoners identified as seriously mentally ill, as defined by the PSA, are not housed \nin restrictive housing for more than 30 consecutive days unless: 1) as allowed by paragraph 32 of \nthe PSA, the DOC concludes that there are present “exceptional circumstances” where removing \nthe prisoner from restrictive housing would pose an unacceptable risk to safety or security, or 2) \nas noted by paragraph 33 of the PSA, the prisoner refuses to leave restrictive housing and the \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 586   Filed 07/05/17   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 9480\nDOC determines that it would cause more harm than benefit to the prisoner to force his or her \nremoval. \n4.  The DOC produced a document showing that there are 18 prisoners who are seriously \nmentally ill who remain in restrictive housing past the 30-day limit because removing them from \nrestrictive housing would present an unacceptable risk to safety and security. The DOC indicated \nthat these prisoners are periodically reevaluated to determine if they may safely be moved to a \nmental health unit. Plaintiffs’ counsel has requested further documentation concerning these \nprisoners. Plaintiffs’ counsel has requested the names of any seriously mentally ill prisoners who \nhave refused to leave restrictive housing and who have been allowed to remain. \n5.   Paragraph 39 of the PSA requires the DOC to notify Kenneth Falk of prisoners who have \nbeen previously classified as seriously mentally ill and who are reclassified to not being seriously \nmentally ill and who are then placed in restrictive housing within 6 months of the reclassification \nand prisoners who while in restrictive housing are reclassified from seriously mentally ill to \nbeing not seriously mentally ill.  These names have not been provided and plaintiffs’ counsel has \nformally requested them. \n6.   Numerous prisoners have complained to plaintiffs’ counsel concerning the limitation or \nbanning of televisions in the mental health units. The DOC believes this is necessary so that \nprisoners do not remain in their cells and fail to attend programming and other activities and does \nnot plan to change current policy. \n7.   Prisoners have claimed that the 10 hours of therapeutic programming requirement is not \nbeing met at the Treatment Unit at Pendleton Correctional Facility. The DOC indicates that this \nis being met even for prisoners who commit a disciplinary infraction and are moved to a separate \nhousing unit.  Here they are able to attend therapy, even if they are cuffed. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 586   Filed 07/05/17   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 9481\n8.    A number of prisoners raised concerns because they were disciplined and lost good-time \ncredit while they were in segregation. The DOC noted that under the terms of the PSA (¶ 53) a \nprisoner may not be disciplined unless, and until, the appropriate mental health professionals are \ncontacted so a determination can be made if the incident causing the discipline was a product of \nthe prisoner’s mental illness.  The DOC indicates that this course of action is always followed \nwhen  it  is  alleged  that  a  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoner  in  a  mental  health  placement  has \ncommitted an offense.  Even if additional restrictive housing time is assigned as punishment it \nwill generally be suspended when the prisoner completes the mental health programming. \n9.  Although the goal for most prisoners at the New Castle Psychiatric Unit is to stabilize \nthem so they can safely be moved to another institution, there are approximately 28 persons who \nthe DOC believes cannot be safely released either because of the severity of their illness or \nbecause of other limitations.  These persons will not be able to make it through the levels at the \nunit and will remain there indefinitely. \n10.   A number of prisoners have claimed to plaintiffs’ counsel concerning verbal abuse by \ncorrectional staff.  No specific incidents were discussed.  The DOC reiterated that the regular \nstaff on the mental health units volunteer to serve there and are specially trained, although at \ntimes, due to staffing shortages, the mental health units may be staffed by officers who are not \nregularly on the units. Plaintiffs’ counsel will inform defendant’s counsel of any future claims.  \n11.   Discussion was had about mental health issues and treatment in the new SNAP units that \nare now in most of the larger male institutions.  These are designed as units for vulnerable \nprisoners, which may include prisoners with mental illness.  They are not mental health or \nrestrictive housing units.  These units generally have an open setting and are geared towards \nkeeping prisoners out of restrictive housing.  The Indiana Women’s Prison has the GRACE Unit, \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 586   Filed 07/05/17   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 9482\nwhich is also not specifically a mental health or restrictive housing unit, but is designed to be a \nbehavior management unit. \n12.   The CCU at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility is a restrictive housing unit.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have received inquiries from prisoners who are housed there who are seriously mentally \nill and who believe they should not be there.  However, the DOC indicated that there are no \nseriously  mentally  ill  prisoners  there,  although  there  are  prisoners  who  have  mental  health \ndiagnoses that fall outside of the definition of serious mental illness.  There is group therapy \navailable in the unit. \n13.  Counsel for the plaintiffs raised the possibility of the parties agreeing to jointly selecting \nan expert or experts to review the program instituted by the DOC, a possibility contemplated by \nthe PSA (¶ 65).  This will be discussed further. \n14.   Plaintiffs’  counsel,  as  well  as  the  Court,  continue  to  receive  correspondence  from \nprisoners complaining of numerous matters relating specifically to the PSA and more generally \nto the treatment of mentally ill prisoners within the DOC.  When appropriate, plaintiffs’ counsel \nwill contact attorneys for the DOC to attempt to resolve issues that arise and the parties continue \nto communicate often. \n15.   Upon request the DOC has continued to allow plaintiffs’ counsel to review medical \nrecords and has responded to inquiries from counsel when inquiries are prompted by the records. \n16.   The parties believe that both sides are continuing to work to ensure that the terms of the \nPSA are met. \n  WHEREFORE, the parties file their Joint Status report.  \nFor the plaintiffs: \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 586   Filed 07/05/17   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 9483\n              s/ Kenneth J.

Dvoskin, Ph.D. ABPP (Forensic) \n \nAugust 4, 2018 \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn April 2018, I was contacted by John Dallas, Vice President of Operations for \nWexford of Indiana, LLC. Wexford is the contractor that provides health and mental \nhealth services to the Indiana Department of Corrections (the Department). Mr. \nDallas asked me to conduct tours of four Indiana Prisons (one of which is operated \nunder contract with the GEO Group).  \n \nDuring my tours, the staff and leadership of Wexford and the Department were \ncordial and candid. At no time was I denied access to inmates, staff at all levels, and \nfacility and leadership. While I reviewed the data produced by the Department and \nWexford regarding compliance with the Settlement Agreement, I did not take their \naccuracy for granted, and confirmed the data with inmates and correction officers in \neach prison.  \n \nIn this report, as agreed in my discussions with Mr. Dallas, I will provide two \ndifferent kinds of observations. First, I will speak directly to the requirements of the \nSettlement Agreement. Second, as agreed with Mr. Dallas, I will provide suggestions \nfor further improvement of the mental health services provided in the four prisons I \ntoured. I very much appreciate the openness displayed by the Department and \nWexford in considering the additional suggestions, but they should in no way \nbe deemed to represent departures from or non-compliance with the \nSettlement Agreement.  \n \nFinally, I wish to thank the leadership of both Wexford and the Department for their \nkindness and hospitality. It was very clear to me that they shared the desire of the \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 2 of 17 PageID #: 9573\nplaintiffs to provide high quality mental health and psychiatric services to their \ninmates. \n \nSources of Information \n \nDuring June 26-28, 2018, I visited four of Indiana’s prisons, as follows: \n \nJune 26, 2018  Wabash Valley Prison \nJune 27, 2018  New Castle State Prison (operated by the GEO Group) \nJune 27, 2018  Indiana Reformatory \nJune 28, 2018  Indiana Women’s Prison \n \nFor each prison, I was provided with recent data regarding the offering of out-of-cell \ntherapeutic programming, including but not limited to structured groups and \nindividual therapy. These reports included explanations of exceptions, i.e., those \ninmates who were not offered at least 10 hours of therapy each week, along with an \nexplanation. I was also given a list of approximately 20 inmates in the State that \nremained in Restrictive Housing Units (RHU) despite being deemed to have a \nserious mental illness (SMI). Each of these exceptions was due to an overriding \nsecurity concern and was approved at the highest levels of the Department. I was \nalso provided with a copy of the Settlement Agreement and was given access to the \nrelevant Departmental policies and procedures.  \n \nPrior to my visit, I was able to speak by telephone with Kenneth Falk, an attorney \nrepresenting the plaintiffs. I also spoke with Mr. Dallas, representing Wexford, and \nDr. Deanna Dwenger, who supervises the programs I was to assess. \n \nAt each prison, I first met with the Warden and members of the executive team. \nThey explained to me the manner in which the prison was operated, with special \nattention to the relationship between custody, correctional programs, and mental \nhealth programs. I was provided a brief tour of each prison, before focusing on the \nRHU and the four mental health units. I was given complete and unfettered access to \ninmates and staff. Whenever I requested privacy, it was provided to me, whether I \nwas talking with inmates, correctional officers, or other staff. \n \nDuring these tours I looked to see if there were inmates with SMI who were not \nidentified. Given the brevity of my conversations with each inmate, it was not \npossible to diagnose anyone; my goal was to see if anyone required evaluation by \nthe mental health and psychiatric staff.  \n \nAt the time the Settlement Agreement was signed, it appears that there was a \nlarge number of inmates with mental illness in restrictive housing. Because of \nthe Settlement Agreement, this no longer appears to be the case. With the \nexception of a small number (approximately 20) of security exceptions, inmates \nwith SMI are moved to various mental health units instead of restrictive housing, or \n  2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 3 of 17 PageID #: 9574\nshortly after arriving there. When the Settlement Agreement was signed, many of \nthe inmates in the four mental health units had been transferred from segregation. \nToday, as a result of the Settlement Agreement and the Department’s enthusiastic \nadherence to it, many of the inmates now housed in the mental health programs \nwere never in restricted housing or were there for a short time. This has allowed for \nthe Department to continue loosening the restrictions placed on these inmates in \nthe SNU and the IRT programs, and I predict that the same thing will happen, albeit \nto a lesser degree, in the New Castle Psychiatric Program. \n \nIn my opinion, the Settlement Agreement was exceptionally clear and well-written, \nwhich made my job of assessing compliance much easier. The definitions of SMI \ncontained in the Settlement Agreement were, in my opinion, reasonable and \nconsistent with modern psychiatric treatment of these conditions.  \n \n \nKey Requirements of the Settlement Agreement \n \n1.  Except in specifically delineated exceptional circumstances, no seriously \nmentally ill prisoners shall be placed in segregation/restrictive housing \n(including protective custody) if they are known to be seriously mentally ill prior \nto such placement, or if they become seriously mentally ill subsequent to such \nplacement. \n \n2.  Otherwise, seriously mentally ill prisoners must be placed in a setting where \nthey could receive at least 10 hours a week of therapeutic programming, not \nincluding the time spent out of cell for recreation, showers, or other purposes \npermitted generally to offenders not in the certified class. Therapeutic \nprogramming can include formal group therapy, individual therapy, therapeutic \nmilieu activity, and other activity as determined by mental health professionals \nas part of an individualized treatment plan. \n \n3.  DOC will maintain sufficient staff to manage the mental health units … and to \nidentify seriously mentally ill prisoners and divert them from placement In \nsegregated/restrictive housing. \n \n4.  Prisoners will be allowed to attend group therapy sessions without restraints \nunless necessary for security reasons. \n \n5.  Prisoners will receive individual therapy provided by a mental health \nprofessional at least once a month. \n \n6.  The agreement also delineates certain exceptions to the DOC Disciplinary Code \nwhen mental health professionals determine that the incident in question was \nthe result of the prisoner’s mental illness.  \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 4 of 17 PageID #: 9575\n7.  During the time that the prisoner is confined (in a suicide-safer cell), the DOC is \nnot required to provide the prisoner with the minimum adequate treatment \nnoted above. In that event, consistent with DOC policy, mental health will \nmonitor the prisoner and the prisoner will be provided appropriate mental \nhealth services and treatment. (Please note, I strongly recommend to the \nparties that this section be changed. I will discuss this recommendation \nbelow.) \n \n \nFindings \n \nSimply put, the Department and Wexford are in full compliance with the \nsubstantive requirements of the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, the \nDepartment and Wexford have internalized these requirements and support \nthem enthusiastically. Overall, I found the leadership on both the DOC side and the \nWexford side to be outstanding. Based on my observations, I truly believe that these \nconditions would continue to be met even if there were no Settlement Agreement. \nMy specific findings will follow. \n \nWabash Valley Prison \n \nAt Wabash Valley, I met with the executive team, who seem very proud of the \nimprovements in mental health care that have been achieved during the past few \nyears. I observed good communication and cooperation between the custody staff \nand the mental health staff. Warden Brown, like the other three wardens I met, is \nimpressive in regard to his leadership as well as his commitment to meeting the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement. Officers are selected to work in the \nSpecial Needs Unit (SNU) based on their interpersonal skills and willingness to work \nwith this population. The Warden assured me that if Wexford staff felt that an officer \nwas inappropriate for this work, he or she would be moved to another assignment. \nAccording to both the prison’s executive team and the Wexford leadership, this has \nnot been a problem. \n \nI talked to several inmates who were on the list of exceptions, meaning that they \nwere housed in RHU despite their SMI due to security concerns. \n \nOne inmate made a series of serious allegations of mistreatment; however, they had \nbeen made in writing to and investigated by the prison administration, and they \nwere not confirmed by other inmates. He reported to me that he has a very long \nhistory of severely self-injurious behavior. This inmate was one of the exceptions to \nthe policy, and had reportedly been removed from the SNU and placed in RHU \nbecause he has been successfully encouraging other inmates to cut themselves.  \n \nI walked the RHU range and had confidential, cell-front conversations with a \nnumber of inmates. One inmate appeared to me to be exhibiting pressured speech, \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 5 of 17 PageID #: 9576\npossibly suggesting a need for additional evaluation and treatment. I referred him to \nDr. Dauss, who quickly arranged for him to receive a psychiatric evaluation. \nSurprisingly, the RHU was relatively quiet and free of any unpleasant smells. \nInteractions between inmates and staff appeared respectful and calm.  \n \nThe Settlement Agreement implied the necessity of identifying RHU inmates with \nserious mental illness, or those who had developed acute emotional problems after \nbeing sent to the RHU. The Department and Wexford have developed a reasonable, \nthough minimal, system of “rounds” in RHU. This practice has become the standard \nof practice in many states, and consists of regular cell front visits, and the ability of \nclinicians or inmates to request private meetings out of cell. The frequency of these \nvisits within IDOC is based upon the mental health designation of the inmates. \nInmates at level A (no known mental illness) must be visited every thirty days. \nInmates at levels B through E and visited at least once per week, and inmates with a \ndesignation of SMI are visited at last twice per week. In my opinion, this meets the \nminimum requirement of the Settlement Agreement. However, in my opinion, the \nDepartment would be well served to visit every RHU inmate at least once per \nweek. (See below.) For example, in some other states, these “rounds in segregation \noccur as often as 5 days perweek. \n \nThe cell used for suicide watch did not have a toilet. Instead, there was a hole \nin the floor that can be flushed. I found this to be offensive, degrading, and \nhumiliating. While it is not contrary to the Settlement Agreement, I recommend \nthat the Department consider changing these conditions as explained below. \n \nI toured the Special Needs Unit (SNU). As everyone is aware, the physical plant of \nthe unit is not ideal for this purpose. However, I was impressed with the way that \nDepartment and Wexford staff have adapted to it to create a reasonably therapeutic \nprogram. In large part, this is due to the professionalism of the officers and \ntherapists who work there. With only a very few and temporary exceptions, all \ninmates were offered at least the 10 hours of therapeutic programming that is \nrequired by the Settlement Agreement. Exceptions were based on security concerns \nthat were temporary and were being addressed by the treatment team. Almost all of \nthe inmates in the SNU are assigned inmate mentors, who are carefully selected and \ntrained for this function.  \n \nThe cell block in which the SNU is located consists of two levels of cells surrounding \na large common area.  The surfaces are entirely hard, creating a great deal of noise \nand echoing that creates a challenge for treatment groups. I recommended to the \nWarden that he consider breaking up the space with upholstered “pony walls” \nthat will allow for more than one group at a time, and will help alleviate the \nsound pollution and echo. The unit housing the SNU was clean, free of unpleasant \nsmells, and its showers were clean and completely free of mold.  \n \nThe right side of the SNU was called the Assessment and Orientation (A&O) part of \nthe program. Most inmates remain here for a relatively short time. While this side of \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 6 of 17 PageID #: 9577\nthe SNU operates in an approximately similar manner as the other side, the inmates \nare supervised a bit more closely. Some inmates, especially those who have recently \narrived n the SNU, are taken to group in handcuffs until they demonstrate the ability \nto behave safely. \n \nThe left side of the SNU was managed on a phase program. Inmates in the left side of \nthe SNU were taken to the chow hall for meals. Some inmates at phases 4 and 5 were \ntaken to group therapy in a different building. Inmates at phase 5 are allowed to \nhave television in their cells. However, if they are not adequately involved in \nprogramming, they could be demoted to a lower lever and denied access to their \ntelevisions.  \n \nI was especially concerned that the Settlement Agreement discussed “milieu \ntherapy,” with no real definition of what that would encompass. My concern in \nreading the Settlement Agreement was that a prison could substitute unstructured \ntime in the day room for truly therapeutic programs.  This was not the case in the \nSNU. The therapists were actively involved in helping the inmates to learn how to \nsocialize appropriately, and took special care to engage more solitary inmates with \nothers as they played cards, board games, or simply engaged in conversation. The \nmanner in which this “milieu therapy” was conducted was appropriate and \ntherapeutic, and very much conformed with the spirit of the Settlement \nAgreement.  \n \nThe therapists and correctional officers working in the SNU were outstanding. \nThey engaged with the inmates in a professional and empathic manner. Moreover, \nthey demonstrated an enthusiasm for the program that was inspiring. \n \nAn appropriate number of inmates were receiving involuntary medication, pursuant \nto the appropriate level of due process. Although I am not a psychiatrist, I did not \nobserve signs that large numbers of inmates were overmedicated.  People \nplaced on involuntary medications are required to be seen 7 days after the first \ninjection, and at clinically appropriate intervals (at least once every thirty days) \nthereafter.  \n \nNew Castle Correctional Facility \n \nNew Castle C.F. is a unique facility of approximately 3200 inmates. It has the only \nprotective custody unit in Indiana, and its general population is largely made up of \nsex offenders. The facility is operated by a contract with GEO, and sex offender \ntreatment is provided by contract with Liberty Healthcare. Warden Butz explained \nthat the dormitories are organized by types of inmates. For example, there is a dorm \nfor incarcerated veterans, a sober housing dorm for people who are recovering from \nsubstance abuse, a dorm for inmates that are heavily involved in education, etc. \n \nAt New Castle, I met with the executive team. As was the case at Wabash Valley, they \nseemed very proud of the improvements in mental health care that have been \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 7 of 17 PageID #: 9578\nachieved during the past few years. Again, I observed good communication and \ncooperation between the custody staff and the mental health staff. Warden Butz is \nan extremely impressive leader with a strong commitment to meeting the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement. Officers are selected to work in the \nSpecial Needs Unit (SNU) based on their interpersonal skills and willingness to work \nwith this population. The Warden assured me that if Wexford staff felt that an officer \nwas inappropriate for this work, he or she would be moved to another assignment. \nAccording to both the prison’s executive team and the Wexford leadership, this has \nnot been a problem. \n \nAccording to the Warden, there are only 31 RHU beds at New Castle. I was \nparticularly impressed by the Warden’s statement, \"We only lock people up when \nwe are afraid of them.\" The Warden also reported, \"We haven't done a cell \nextraction over two years.\"  \n \nCorrectional officers who work in the “New Castle Psych” (NCP) program or in the \nRHU receive training as Certified Treatment Specialists (CTS.) While I did not review \nthe entire training curriculum, the description of the training sounded appropriate. \n \nCommunication between mental health staff and correctional officers seems to work \nwell. Observations by correctional officers are communicated orally or in writing to \nthe mental health staff, who in turn document the observation in a progress note in \nthe medical record. In addition, there are shift reports between custody and the \nmental health team. \n \nAs was the case at Wabash Valley and is explained below, the rooms used for \nseclusion or suicide watch are not equipped with toilets. Instead, there are flushable \nholes in the floor of the cell. (See below.) \n \nThe therapists and correction officers working in the NCP Program were \noutstanding. They engaged with the inmates in a professional and empathic manner. \nMoreover, they demonstrated an enthusiasm for the program that was inspiring. \n \nAn appropriate number of inmates were receiving involuntary medication, pursuant \nto the appropriate level of due process. Although I am not a psychiatrist, I did not \nobserve signs that large numbers of inmates were overmedicated.  People \nplaced on involuntary medications are required to be seen 7 days after the first \ninjection, and at clinically appropriate intervals (at least once every thirty days) \nthereafter.  \n \nThe New Castle Psych Program (NCP) consists of 128 beds, divided into eight ranges \nof 16 beds each. The NCP houses those inmates with the most acute and severe \nmental health needs. Many of them had behaved in a manner that was dangerous to \nothers. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, such inmates are no longer routinely \nhoused in RHU. The NCP is a more therapeutic and less punitive alternative. \nImportantly, the same officers are assigned to the NCP every day, which contributes \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 8 of 17 PageID #: 9579\nto the teamwork with the mental health staff and decreases the likelihood of \ncounter-therapeutic interactions. \n \nWhile the Settlement Agreement only requires that 10 hours of therapeutic \nprogramming be offered, good correctional and mental health practice carefully \nmonitors the number of hours that are received. Thus, it is important to minimize \nthe number of inmates who refuse to participate in treatment. One particularly \ntalented therapist, Ms. Heimann, has gained a reputation as the \"refuser whisper.\" \nThrough a combination of skill and empathy, she seems to be able to successfully \nencourage inmates to participate. I suggested to Dr. Dwenger that these skills can be \ntaught to other therapists throughout the state, which would further enhance the \nrate of participation in the treatment that is offered.  \n \nI was also pleased to see that Ms. Heimann conducts a spirituality group. \nPeople with the most severe psychiatric disabilities have physical, cognitive, and \nemotional problems that are frequently the subject of psychiatric and mental health \ntreatment. It is less common to find clinical attention to their spiritual needs. \nAccording to several inmates, this non-denominational group helps them to think \nabout the meaning of their lives and their place in the world. \n \nI noted that the restraint beds used in this program pose the possibility of a suicide \nrisk, however, this risk is mitigated when the inmates are under constant \nsupervision. \n \nOne inmate, with a history of chronic self-injury, reported that he was confined to \nthe padded suicide watch cell for \"months.\" He reported that he felt punished for \nharming himself, and complained that he was allowed only boxer shorts despite the \nfact that the suicide watch cell was cold. He reported that he requested crayons, a \nradio, and more therapy, but was denied while he was housed in the suicide watch \ncell. When I asked staff about these reports, custody staff reported that the suicide-\nresistant \"smocks” could be torn apart and used as a ligature, which is why he was \nnot allowed a smock. I suggested that they consider buying a better quality \nsmock and suicide-resistant blankets, and mentioned several companies who \nprovide these items. \n \nSuicide watch is enhanced by the presence of inmate \"companions,\" who are tasked \nwith watching the suicidal inmate constantly. Unfortunately, these inmates are \nprecluded from engaging in conversation with the suicidal inmates, making the \nword \"companion\" ironic and inaccurate. So long as these inmates are well-\ntrained, well supervised, and clearly told that they are not therapists, there is \nno good reason for them to silently stare at the inmates that the prison is \ntrying to keep alive. \n \nThe NCP Program offers the required number of hours of therapeutic \nprogramming. Although I was only briefly able to sit in on a group, based on inmate \nreports the quality of therapy appears good.  \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 9 of 17 PageID #: 9580\n \nIndiana Reformatory \n \nAt the Indiana Reformatory (IR), I met with Warden Dusan Zatecky and the \nexecutive team. As was the case with the other facilities, they seem very proud of \nthe improvements in mental health care that have been achieved during the \npast few years. Again, I observed good communication and cooperation between \nthe custody staff and the mental health staff. There was a complete commitment, \nfrom the top down, to meeting the requirements of the Settlement Agreement. \nOfficers are selected to work in the Indiana Reformatory Treatment Unit (IRT) \nbased on their interpersonal skills and willingness to work with this population. I \nobserved no problems with the behavior and demeanor of the correctional staff \nassigned to the IRT, and was again assured that such a problem would be quickly \nremedied if it arose. \n \nAt IR, I noted that Protective Custody (PC) inmates are housed in the Restrictive \nHousing Unit (RHU), as the facility does not have a PC unit. Most of the inmates who \nare deemed to be appropriate for PC are transferred to other institutions. Most of \nthe time, these transfers are voluntary. However, when inmates are unwilling to \nexplain the reason that they believe themselves to be at risk, they may be \ntemporarily housed in the RHU, usually for less than 60 days. \n \nThe IRT is similar to the SNU at Wabash Valley in many ways. Inmates housed there \ncan be classified at any custody level. The main difference between the two \nprograms is that the disorders of the inmates housed in the IRT are deemed to be \nmore likely to be primarily characterological rather than psychotic. The belief is that \ninmates with severe character disorders, even if they are legitimately classified as \nSMI, are likely to take advantage of the more debilitated inmates housed in the SNU. \nI think this is a reasonable belief, and this plan appears to be working well. \n \nThe IRT consists of 156 people in 194 beds. There are four different buildings, \nseparated by the privilege phase the inmate has achieved. Some of the inmates in \nthis program are transferred from the NCP program, while others are transferred \ndirectly from general population. When the program first opened, there was a \nproblem with a prevalence of predatory inmates. The situation was dealt with, \nmainly through the use of appropriate clinical consequences. \n \nWhile the IRT is housed in separate buildings, the program is \"semi-integrated\" with \nthe general population, including a shared chow hall. This arrangement increases \nthe chances that at least some inmates with serious mental illness will be able to \neventually rejoin the general population. \n \nUnit C1 consists of 24 cells and is quite restrictive. There are four inmate mentors \nwho work with the inmates housed in these cells. The inmates are offered 10 hours \nper week of group activities as required by the Settlement Agreement; however, \nthey come out in restraints that include an uncomfortable \"black box\" that prevents \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 10 of 17 PageID #:\n9581\ninmates from freeing themselves from handcuffs. In my opinion, the use of the \nblack box is unnecessarily punitive and a strong disincentive for participating \nin treatment. I recommend that its use be discontinued unless an inmate has \ndemonstrated an ability to get out of handcuffs or presents other compelling \nsecurity concerns. Luckily, it appears that this status is relatively short-term, as the \nlength of stay in C1 was reported to average less than two months. Finally, for the \ninmates who did come out for group, their reports were generally positive about the \nquality of the groups. I was told that Bible study groups do not count as therapeutic \nprogram for the purposes of the Settlement Agreement. I recommend that Bible \nstudy and other organized spiritual activities should count as therapeutic \nprograms, as they are extremely valuable and therapeutic. \n \nThere were several good things about the C1 unit. There are four inmate mentors \nwho spend time talking with the C1 inmates. I met several of the mentors, and they \nappeared to be experienced, mature, and helpful. I recommend that the \nDepartment consider carefully expanding this mentor program. Mature, \nexperienced inmates have credibility that is very different from that of officers and \nclinicians. Inmates in C1 also stated that the staff generally dealt with them in a fair \nand respectful manner. \n \nOn a less happy note, the acoustics in this building are terrible. Unfortunately, I can't \nthink of any good recommendation to fix this problem. On the other hand, the \nbuzzer that signifies meals is extremely loud and unpleasant, and sounds very much \nlike a fire alarm. Apparently, because of the noise and poor acoustics of the unit, it \nwas felt that this type of signal was necessary. I would recommend seeking a \nbetter solution for announcing meals. \n \nFor inmates in C-1, the exercise areas are stark and barren of any equipment at all. \nAgain, this is a disincentive for inmates to accept the recreation time, and increases \nboredom and anger. I recommend at the facility consider installing some safe, \nbasic exercise equipment in these outdoor exercise areas. \n \nInmates in C1 are cuffed and shackled whenever they leave their cells. I understand \nwhy some inmates need to be restrained when they are in a particularly acute or \nviolent state, however there are other ways to accomplish this. For example, the \nstate of New York has developed a \"Re-start Chair,\" which allows an inmate to freely \nand relatively comfortably participate in programs, with no ability to reach staff or \nother inmates. \n \nThe groups are led by likeable, enthusiastic, and competent counselors. A \nsuggestion is to remind is counselors to avoid long, unfamiliar words and closed-end \nquestions that allowed inmates to provide one-word answers without actually \nparticipating. Amazingly, several inmates complained about the groups as \nbeing \"too short.\" I can think of no greater compliment to group therapists. \nThat being said, I do recommend some additional training for the people doing \ngroup therapy. \n  10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 11 of 17 PageID #:\n9582\n \nThere were some complaints from inmates that their dayroom recreation periods, \nespecially in the evening. are sometimes cut with no reason being given. When I \nasked about this, staff usually gave a sensible and credible reason; however I \nrecommend spending a little more time explaining this to inmates, and \nperhaps making it up the next night. When I suggested this to the custody \nsupervisor, he stated, “I don’t do give-backs.” I did not have time to explore this \nresponse, and I’m not sure I understand it. If inmates are entitled to something, but \ncan’t receive it through no fault of their own (e.g., temporary staff shortage) why \nwould it not be fair to make it up to them the next day? \n \nOn the same topic, out of cell time in phases 3 and 4 appear to be only 2-3 hours per \nday. Further, I was told that the number of hours does not increase when an inmate \ngraduates from phase 3 to phase 4. I recommend that the facility consider \nincreasing the out of cell time in both phases 3 and 4, with phase 4 receiving \nmore time than phase 3. \n \nOverall, I again found the leadership on both the DOC side and the Wexford side to \nbe outstanding. \n \n \nIndiana Women’s Prison (IWP) \n \nAt IWP, I met with Warden Laurie Johnson and her executive team. Again, I found \ngreat communication between mental health and custody staff. There are three \nwomen's prisons in Indiana, but inmates in need of mental health services, including \nthose covered by the Settlement Agreement, are transferred to IWP. The women's \nSNU is unique, in that the more secure area (similar to NCP) is housed in the same \nbuilding as the SNU. This combination makes good sense, in light of the smaller \nnumber of women in the program. \n \nThe Restrictive Status Housing Unit (RSHU) consists of 25 beds. To the credit of the \ncorrectional officers assigned there, the unit was clean and quiet. On the other hand, \nit appeared that inmates have limited access to books and other safe diversions \nwhile housed in restrictive housing. One woman, for example, spoke only limited \nEnglish, and wanted a book in Spanish that she could read to alleviate her boredom. \nApparently, none of the mental health staff speaks Spanish, which poses a real \nproblem for Spanish-speaking inmates with serious mental illness. In this woman's \ncase, this problem could be somewhat alleviated by using a translator and \nperhaps assigning a Spanish-speaking inmate mentor to spend some time with \nher. \n \nOfficially, rounds in segregation follow departmental policy, in that inmates with a \nmental health designation of A are only required to be \"rounded\" by a mental health \nprofessional once per month. It appears that the actual performance is better than \nthat. In fact, at IWP, all inmates in restricted housing are provided 10 hours per \n  11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 12 of 17 PageID #:\n9583\nweek of out of cell time. Nevertheless, I repeat my recommendation that policy \nshould require that every inmate throughout IDOC in restricted housing \nshould be rounded by a mental health professional at least once per week. \n \nI saw one woman who is receiving involuntary medication yet appears to be in \nsevere and acute distress. The prisons have no ability to transfer anyone to the state \nhospital, and while this should be very rarely needed, here was a case that seemed \nto obviously require such a transfer. As a former state hospital administrator, I \nunderstand why departments of mental health are cautious about accepting \ncorrectional transfers into a limited number of state hospital beds. I do, however, \nsuggest that IDOC negotiate for a small number of beds at the state hospital, to \nbe used only in the most extreme circumstances. \n \nCurrently, the SNU houses 30 inmates in 46 beds. As was the case at IP, several \ngeneral population inmates also lived there and serve as mentors. Again, I was \nimpressed by this program and suggest consideration of its expansion. \n \nThe Warden explained that they hand-select the officers who were to be assigned to \nthe SNU, and all of them receive CTS training, as described above. As was the case in \nthe other facilities, I was consistently impressed with the professionalism, \ncompetence, and therapeutic orientation of the correctional officers assigned to the \nmental health units. This was especially true in IWP, where I observed a number of \nextremely skillful interventions. \n \nGenerally, I found the staff open and sensitive to the problems related to trauma, \nwhich are extremely prevalent especially (but certainly not exclusively) among \nwomen inmates. However, I strongly recommend that all of the clinicians who \nwork in Indiana's prisons receive additional training on trauma-informed \ntherapies. While I did not get a chance to review the CST curriculum, I recommend \nreviewing it to ensure that trauma-related training is included in the training \nfor officers who work in mental health and restrictive housing units. \n \nI met one inmate with a severe eating disorder. Speaking with the staff, it became \nclear that they could profit from some additional sophisticated training on the \ntreatment of eating disorders. \n \nAlthough it is perhaps tangential to the official purpose of my visit, I would be \nremiss if I did not mention the \"Wee Ones” program that allows new mothers to \nremain with their babies for up to 30 months. The program is extremely well run, \nwith excellent management and good support from the prison administration, \nwhich takes justifiable pride in the program. While not officially a mental health \nprogram, I can assure you that a program like this has immense emotional and \nbehavioral value to these women inmates. My only recommendation is to publish \na description of the “Wee Ones” program so that it can be emulated by other \nprison systems. \n \n  12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 13 of 17 PageID #:\n9584\n \nFindings and Recommendations regarding the Settlement \nAgreement \n \nSimply put, the Department and its contractor (Wexford) are in diligent \ncompliance with all aspects of the Settlement Agreement. \n \nI do, however, recommend changes to item 56 of the Settlement Agreement, \nwhich reads, \"During the time that the prisoner is confined (in a suicide-safer cell), \nthe DOC is not required to provide the prisoner with the minimum adequate \ntreatment noted above. Consistent with DOC policy, mental health will monitor a \nprisoner on suicide watch and the prisoner will be provided “appropriate mental \nhealth services and treatment.” \n \nWhile there is a vague mention of providing “appropriate mental health services and \ntreatment\" to inmates on suicide watch, in practice it appears that the quality and \nquantity of mental health treatment is actually lower when inmates are on suicide \nwatch. Ironically, suicidal inmates are in need of more, not less treatment \nduring periods of suicidal crisis.  \n \nThere is a widespread belief in American corrections that inmates on suicide watch \nmust be housed alone in a cell 24 hours per day until they are no longer deemed to \nbe suicidal. This practice flies in the face of what we know about suicide prevention. \nThere is no evidence whatsoever that being locked in a room alone is appropriate \npsychological treatment for suicidal ideation or behavior. Further, as noted below, \nif the circumstances of suicide watch are perceived as punitive, it will \ndissuade truly suicidal inmates from coming forward and asking for help. If \ntherapeutic activities are adequately supervised, then there is no reason that a \nsuicidal inmate cannot participate in some therapeutic activities, especially if they \nare being constantly watched by a staff member. I would suggest that the \ndepartment adopt a presumption that inmates on suicide watch fully participate in \ntreatment unless it is clinically determined that such participation would be \ncounter-therapeutic or dangerous to the inmate or others. \n \nPlease note, I was told by several staff members that the problem of malingered \nsuicidal behavior is best solved by making sure that suicide watch is not a pleasant \nexperience. Sadly, this belief is common among many correction institutions across \nthe country. The belief is that unpleasant or even punitive conditions of suicide \nwatch will decrease false claims of suicidality. Even if this is true, it will also have \nthe same effect on people who are truly suicidal, thus inadvertently increasing the \nrisk of suicide. Further, it doesn’t work, as malingering continues to be a problem. It \nis worth considering why a person would feign suicidal intent. For example, if the \ninmate is seeking suicide watch due to fear of something or someone in their \nhousing unit, it is no wonder that unpleasant conditions do not deter them from \nasking to be safely locked up. Finally, no clinician can reliably distinguish between \n  13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 14 of 17 PageID #:\n9585\nfeigned and real suicidal intent; indeed, the two often co-exist. In summary, people \nwho claim to be suicidal need more treatment, not less, and conditions that \nare reasonably perceived to be punitive are inappropriate as part of a suicide \nprevention program.  \n \nThroughout the system, I was impressed with the relatively low number of \nnonparticipants among inmates in the various mental health units. In large \npart, this appears to be due to the friendly and likable mental health staff who \nprovide these programs, and the encouragement and support provided by many of \nthe custody officers. \n \nI was also pleased to hear of system-wide efforts by the Department to reduce \nthe overall use of restrictive housing, both by reducing admissions to RHU and by \nreducing lengths of stay. \n \n \nRecommendations Outside of the Settlement Agreement \n \nIt is interesting to note that the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \nhas significantly changed the manner in which IDOC uses restrictive housing, \nat least as it applies to inmates with serious mental illness. As a result, these \nprograms are no longer best understood as a way to get inmates out of \nrestrictive housing. Basically they have become very appropriate ways to meet \nthe mental health needs of inmates. I congratulate the parties for this \nachievement. \n \nAt New Castle and Wabash Valley, the cells used for suicide watch did not have \ntoilets. Instead, there was a hole in the floor that can be flushed. I found this to \nbe offensive, degrading, and likely to be experienced as punitive. I also believe \nit can inadvertently increase the risk of suicide. When the circumstances of \nsuicide watch are reasonably perceived to be punitive, it decreases the likelihood \nthat truly suicidal inmates will ask for the help they need. While it is not contrary to \nthe Settlement Agreement, I recommend that the Department consider changing \nthese conditions. All of the cells used for suicide watch should be equipped with \na secure toilet/sink combination unit. Flushable holes in the floor are an \nanachronism; to my knowledge, no prison or psychiatric hospital built in this \ncentury has included such a cell. In my opinion, this practice is likely to cause \ninmates unnecessary humiliation and a feeling of shame that is unnecessary and \ncounter-therapeutic. If an inmate attempts self-injury by banging his or her head \nagainst the sink/toilet, it would justify transferring them to a room equipped for \ntop-of-bed restraints. \n \nThe restraint beds are equipped with metal rings to which restraints are attached. \nHowever, these rings are far enough off of the floor to allow an inmate to commit \nsuicide by hanging. In my opinion, this precludes the use of these rooms for \n  14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 15 of 17 PageID #:\n9586\nseclusion, unless the inmate is under constant supervision by staff. To its credit, the \nDepartment has appropriately mitigated this risk by placing restrained inmates on \nconstant observation. There are, however, much safer beds available for this \npurpose, where the restraints can be attached at floor level.   \n \nIt was unclear to me how often the suicide prevention committees are meeting. \nThis is an important function. In addition to reviewing the data on suicide deaths \nand attempts, this Committee should be tasked with proactively searching for \nphysical spaces and practices that could be altered to reduce the risk of suicide even \nfurther. Examples would include creation of a “punch list” of suicide hazards to be \nused for cell inspections, such as identifying loose fixtures that might allow for the \nattachment of a ligature, and identifying sharp metal edges on beds and other \nfurniture. Obviously, these inspections are especially important in cells used for \nsuicide watch, mental health treatment, and restrictive housing. To cite another \nexample, the committee might survey the correctional staff to look for ways to \nimprove pre-service and inservice suicide prevention training. \n \nThe common area of the SNU at Wabash Valley is ill suited for groups, and \nvirtually precludes conducting more than one group at a time. In many of \nCalifornia’s prisons, they have created multiple group rooms by strategically placing \nupholstered “pony walls.” This configuration works very well, and allows the \nCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to successfully conduct \nmultiple groups at the same time. I recommend that the Department consider \naltering the large day rooms at Wabash Valley SNU by adding upholstered \n\"pony walls,\" similar to those used in some California prisons. \n \nWhen inmates with SMI appear to be making no progress, it would be good to \nconduct a formal case conference, including some of the most experienced and \nwell-trained clinicians throughout the system. In some cases, these case \nconferences might include outside consultants with specialty skills such as the \ntreatment of eating disorders. \n \nIn speaking with staff at each facility, it is clear that the rounds in segregation are \nmore frequent than officially required by policy. For people with the lowest mental \nhealth needs rating (level A), there is an official requirement of mental health \nrounds in segregation once every 30 days, unless the inmate requests a visit. I \nrealize this comports with ACA standards, but in my opinion it is not adequate. That \nbeing said, in my conversations with clinicians, it appears that inmates in \nRestrictive Housing are visited by a mental health professional at least once a \nweek. My recommendation is to make this a requirement by policy. I also \nrecommend that the policy explicitly state that either an inmate or mental \nhealth staff member can request an audibly private meeting, as opposed to a \ncell-front visit. \n \nI also noted that the mental health codes (A-F) do not correlate to the designation of \nSeriously Mentally Ill (SMI). I am not certain, but I wonder if this discrepancy may \n  15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 16 of 17 PageID #:\n9587\nbe confusing to inmates or staff. If this is the case, my recommendation is to \nconsider incorporating the SMI designation into the system of mental health \ncodes. On the other hand, if the dual system seems to be working well, there may be \nno need to change it.  \n \nI reviewed the seclusion and restraint policy, which looks good except for the \ndesignation of seclusion and restraint as \"therapeutic.\" There is nothing \ntherapeutic about seclusion or restraint, although it is sometimes necessary to \nprotect inmates or staff. I would also suggest adding to the policy more specific rules \nregarding the frequency of staff observation for inmates in seclusion and restraint, \nand a revisiting of the roles of “companions” (See below). \n \nI was especially pleased with one part of the suicide watch policy, which \nrequires follow-up of any inmate who was on suicide watch at 24 hour, one \nweek, two week, and one month intervals. \n \nSuicide watch is enhanced by the presence of inmate \"companions,\" who are tasked \nwith watching a suicidal inmate constantly. Unfortunately, these inmates are \nprecluded from engaging in conversation with the suicidal inmates, making the \nword \"companion\" ironic and inaccurate. So long as these inmates are well \ntrained, well supervised, and clearly told that they are not therapists, there is \nno good reason for them to silently stare at the inmates that they are trying to \nkeep alive. Forced solitude is not a legitimate treatment for a suicidal crisis.  \n \nI was a bit confused by the fact that “case plans” and “mental health treatment plans” \nwere completely separate.  Since I am not sure exactly how this is working, I refrain \nfrom making a specific recommendation. However, it is important to make sure \nthat these plans are either integrated or at least complementary. \n \nAs noted earlier, I was impressed with the \"mentor\" program, which is \nsometimes a good way to encourage the most difficult inmates to consider \nparticipating in treatment programs. Often, experienced inmates have credibility \nthat mental health and correctional professionals do not. If my understanding is \ncorrect, this program is not in place at NCP. Of course, these mentors must be \ncarefully selected, trained, and supervised. If it is not already the case, I suggest \nconsideration of expanding this program. \n \nGenerally, I found the staff open and sensitive to the problems related to trauma, \nwhich are extremely prevalent among all inmates. However, I strongly \nrecommend that all of the clinicians who work in Indiana's prisons receive \nadditional training on trauma-informed therapies. While I did not get a chance \nto review the CST curriculum, I recommend reviewing it to ensure that trauma \n-related training is included in the training for officers who work in mental \nhealth and restrictive housing units. \n \n  16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 613-2   Filed 09/04/18   Page 17 of 17 PageID #:\n9588\nSummary and Conclusion \n \nAs stated above, the Department and Wexford are in full compliance with the \nsubstantive requirements of the Settlement Agreement. Moreover, the \nDepartment and Wexford have internalized these requirements and support \nthem enthusiastically. Overall, I found the leadership on both the DOC side \nand the Wexford side to be outstanding. Based on my observations, I truly \nbelieve that these conditions will continue to be met even when there is no \nlonger a Settlement Agreement.  \n \nI am very grateful to the leadership of IDOC, Wexford, as well as the staff and \ninmates at the 4 prisons I visited. They treated me with hospitality and respect, \nand responded to me questions with integrity and candor.  \n \nFinally, I want to congratulate the Plaintiffs, especially Mr. Falk, and the legal \nteam and leadership of IDOC for the collaborative manner in which this case \nwas resolved. The Settlement Agreement was clear and reasonable, and has \nresulted in prisons that are safer and healthier for inmates and staff alike. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJoel A.

On February 28, 2020, counsel for the plaintiffs and defendant were given a tour \nof  the  Pendleton  Treatment  Unit  by  staff  from  both  the  Department  of  Correction \n(“DOC”) and Wexford of Indiana, LLC. \n2.   As  previously  reported,  the  structure  where  treatment  was  provided  to  the \nprisoners in the Treatment Unit was destroyed by fire in September of 2018. \n3.   The hope was that the structure would be completely rebuilt and reopened for use \nin 2019. \n4.   Unfortunately,  the  project  has  been  delayed,  although  construction  is  now \noccurring. \n[1] \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 689   Filed 03/08/20   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 9886\n5.   It is anticipated that the structure will be opened and ready to provide services by \nJune of 2020. \n6.   In the absence of the building, most treatment groups are meeting in the prisoner \nliving units, although some are being provided in a separate building.  \n7.   Because there is not enough physical space for the groups to meet as frequently as \ndesired and as set out in the parties’ Private Settlement Agreement, the required 10 hours \nof out-of-cell treatment a week are not currently being provided at Pendleton.  \n8.   Also  at  times  correctional  staff  are  not  available  at  Pendleton  to  facilitate \nmovement of prisoners. This also negatively impacts the ability to provide group therapy. \n9.   As a result of these circumstances, some prisoners in the Treatment Unit are only \nreceiving 3-5 hours a week of group therapy. \n10.   Currently the unit is staffed to be able to provide the required 10 hours of out-of-\ncell treatment a week and the DOC anticipates that once the new building is completed, \nthe 10-hour-a-week standard will once again be met. \n11.   The new building will contain 8 classrooms as well as 11 offices for treatment staff. \n12.   In order to address prisoners with both mental health and addiction issues, the D \nbuilding within the Treatment Unit, previously housing seriously mentally ill prisoners, \nnow houses prisoners with substance abuse, as well as mental health, issues and the \ntreatment provided to these prisoners addresses both needs. \n[2] \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 689   Filed 03/08/20   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 9887\n13.   During the tour, DOC and Wexford staff discussed the treatment of seriously \nmentally ill prisoners throughout the DOC, including at the psychiatric unit at the New \nCastle Correctional Facility. \n14.   In order to properly track mentally ill prisoners and provide for their treatment, \nthere is state-wide review of prisoners with DOC and Wexford staff every Friday. \n15.   The list of seriously mentally ill prisoners deemed to be too dangerous to be moved \nout of restrictive housing remains low, approximately 16 at the time of the tour at \nPendleton.  These  prisoners  are  formally  reviewed  by  mental  health  staff  at  their \ninstitutions every other week and by classification staff every month to determine if they \ncan be safely moved out of restrictive housing.   \n16.   The DOC staff person ultimately responsible for approving the determination that \nthe prisoner is too dangerous to move out of restrictive housing rigorously reviews \nrequests that a prisoner be determined to meet this category and rejects most such \nrequests. Generally, prisoners who fall into this category do so because of a lengthy \nhistory of assaultive behavior on staff. \n17.   The DOC and Wexford are currently reviewing various policies and protocols \nconcerning prisoners with potential suicidal behavior so as to better assure prisoner \nsafety. \n18.   The DOC continues to provide plaintiffs’ counsel with access to prisoner medical \nrecords and responses to questions raised by plaintiffs’ counsel on behalf of their clients. \n[3] \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 689   Filed 03/08/20   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 9888\n19.   While the inability of the Pendleton Treatment Unit to provide the minimum \nweekly treatment hours required by the Private Settlement Agreement is obviously of \nconcern, plaintiffs’ counsel has no doubt about the commitment that the DOC and \nWexford have to providing the prisoners with treatment and attempting to meet the \nterms of the Private Settlement Agreement. \n20.   In Docket Number 649 in this action, the parties agreed to extend the Private \nSettlement Agreement for a period of one year after the settlement agreement was \nterminated in the case of Mast v. Donahue, No. 2:05-cv-00037-JPH-DLP.  \n21.   The Mast settlement was terminated on July 23, 2019. (Dkt. 164, No. 2:05-cv-0037-\nJPH-DLP (S.D. Ind. July 23, 2019)). \n25.   Therefore, at the current time, the Private Settlement Agreement in this case will \nexpire on July 23, 2020. \n26.   In light of the importance of the Pendleton Treatment Unit in the treatment of \nseriously mentally ill prisoners within the DOC, and in light of the fact that the Unit has \nbeen operating at a reduced capacity because of the fire and the destruction of the \nbuilding in which treatment was provided, plaintiffs have proposed that the Private \nSettlement in this case be extended an additional one year, to July 23, 2021. This would \nallow the DOC to achieve and maintain full compliance with the terms of the Private \nSettlement Agreement before its termination.  \n[4] \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 689   Filed 03/08/20   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 9889\n27.

Synopsis of Case \n \nA.   Plaintiff, on behalf of its clients and constituents claims that the isolated \nconfinement  of  seriously  mentally  ill  prisoners,  without  adequate \ntreatment,  within  the  Department  of  Correction  and  the  New  Castle \nCorrectional  Facility  violates  the  8th  amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n \nB.  Defendant contends that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue claims on \nbehalf of prisoners and that there is no case or controversy because this is \na matter within and between Indiana state agencies.  Defendant further \ncontends that this case is or soon will be moot due to changes in the \nprocedures and practices of the Department of Correction relating to care \nfor mentally ill offenders. \n \nIII.  Pretrial Pleadings and Disclosures \n \n  Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss which is fully briefed and pending \nbefore the trial court.  Defendant contends that it is premature to impose any case \nmanagement planning and any deadlines until and unless the Motion to Dismiss is \nresolved in plaintiff’s favor.  Defendant therefore objects to any and all deadlines.  \nThe below deadlines are entered into by the defendant with the understanding that \nhis initial position is that no deadlines should be entered at all at this juncture.  By \nagreeing to the deadlines, defendant does not waive his right to argue that no \ndeadlines should be entered at this time. \n \n  A.  The parties shall serve their Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 initial disclosures on or \nbefore May 1, 2009.  This is 7 months from the Anchor Date. \n \n  B.   Plaintiff shall file preliminary witness and exhibit lists no later than 30 \ndays following the trial court’s resolution of the Motion to Dismiss (provided that \nthe Motion is denied). \n \n  C.   Defendant shall file preliminary witness and exhibit lists no later than 60 \ndays following the trial court’s resolution of the Motion to Dismiss (provided that \nthe Motion is denied). \n \n  D.  All motions for leave to amend the pleadings and or/or to join additional \nparties shall be filed no later than 90 days following the trial court’s resolution of \nthe Motion to Dismiss (provided that the Motion is denied). \n \n  E.  Plaintiff shall serve defendant (but not file with the Court) a settlement \ndemand,  no  later  than  5  months  following  the  trial  court’s  resolution  of  the \nMotion to Dismiss (provided that the Motion is denied).  Defendant shall serve on \nthe plaintiff (but not file with the Court) a response thereto within 60 days after \nreceipt of the demand. \n  2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 43   Filed 04/09/09   Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 200\n \n  F.  Plaintiff shall disclose the name, address, and vita of all expert witnesses, \nand shall serve the report required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) no later than \nNovember 1, 2009.  However, if plaintiff uses expert witness testimony at the \nsummary judgment stage, such disclosures must be made no later than 60 days \nprior to the summary judgment deadline. \n \n  G.   Defendant  shall  disclose  the  name,  address,  and  vita  of  all  expert \nwitnesses, and shall serve the report required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B) \nwithin 30 days after plaintiff serves its expert witness disclosure; or, if none, \ndefendant  shall  make  its  expert  disclosure  no  later  than  December  1,  2009.  \nHowever, if defendant uses expert testimony at the summary judgment stage, such \ndisclosures must be made no later than 30 days prior to the summary judgment \ndeadline. \nThe list of final \n \nwitnesses shall \n  H.   Any party who wishes to limit or preclude expert testimony at trial shall \ninclude a brief \nfile any such objection no later than 60 days before trial.  Any party who wishes \nsynopsis of the \nto preclude expert witness testimony at the summary judgment stage shall file any \nexpected testimony \nsuch  objections  with  their  responsive  brief  within  the  briefing  schedule \nand counsel's \nestablished by Local Rule 56.1. \ncertification that the \n \nwitness has been \n  I.   All parties shall file and serve their final witness and exhibit lists on or \ninterviewed and/or \nbefore December 1, 2009. \ndeposed.\n \n  J.   Any  party  who  believes  that  bifurcation  of  discovery  and/or  trial  is \nappropriate with respect to any issue or claim shall notify the Court as soon as \npracticable. \n \n  K.   The  parties  will  discuss  preservation  and  disclosure  of  electronically \nstored discovery information after a ruling on the motion to dismiss, including a \ntimetable for making the materials available to the opposing party.   If agreement \ncannot be reached, either party may notify the Court and request a conference \nwith the Magistrate Judge. \n \n \nIV.   Discovery1 and Dispositive Motions \n \n                                                 \n  1The term “completed,” as used in Section IV.B, means that counsel must serve \ntheir discovery requests in sufficient time to receive responses before this deadline.  \nCounsel may not serve discovery requests within the 30-day period before this deadline \nunless they seek leave of Court to serve a belated request and show good cause for the \nsame.  In such event, the proposed belated discovery request shall be filed with the \nmotion, and the opposing party will receive it with service of the motion but need not \nrespond to the same until such time as the Court grants the motion. \n  3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 43   Filed 04/09/09   Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 201\n  Due to the time and expense involved in conducting expert witness depositions \nand other discovery, as well as preparing and resolving dispositive motions, the Court \nrequires counsel to use the CMP as an opportunity to seriously explore whether this case \nis appropriate for such motions (including specifically motions for summary judgment), \nwhether expert witnesses will be needed, and how long discovery should continue.  To \nthis end, counsel must select the track set forth below that they believe best suits this \ncase.  If the parties are unable to agree on a track, the parties must: (1) state this fact in \nthe CMP where indicated below; (2) indicate which track each counsel believes is most \nappropriate; and (3) provide a brief statement supporting the reasons for the track each \ncounsel believes is most appropriate.  If the parties are unable to agree on a track, the \nCourt will pick the track it finds most appropriate, based upon the contents of the CMP \nor, if necessary, after receiving additional input at an initial pretrial conference. \n \nA.  Does any party believe that this case may be appropriate for summary \njudgment or other dispositive motion?  If yes, the party(ies) that expect to \nfile such a motion must provide a brief statement of the factual and/or \nlegal basis for such a motion.   YES \n \n  Plaintiff:   Plaintiff does not believe that summary judgment is \nlikely  in  this  case.    However,  the  uncontested  facts  may \ndemonstrate  that  the  segregated  and  isolated  confinement  of \nseriously mentally ill prisoners violates the 8th amendment.  \n \n  Defendant:  Defendant  is  making  changes  to  the  procedures \napplicable  to  care  of  mentally  ill  prisoners  and  although  no \nconstitutional violations are present, this action will be factually \nmoot and subject to dismissal. \n.  \n \nB.  Select the track that best suits this case: \n \n X Track 2: Dispositive motions are expected and shall be filed no later than 11 months \nfollowing the trial court’s resolution of the Motion to Dismiss (provided that the \nMotion  is  denied).    Non-expert  witness  discovery  and  discovery  relating  to \nliability issues shall be completed no later than 10 months following the trial \ncourt’s resolution of the Motion to Dismiss (provided that the Motion is denied).  \nExpert witness discovery shall be completed no later than February 1, 2010. \n         \nV.  Pre-Trial/Settlement Conferences \n \nThe plaintiff wishes to discuss with the Court at the initial pre-trial conference in this \ncause whether a settlement conference with the Magistrate Judge is warranted.  The \ndefendant believes that such a discussion is premature at this time in light of the rapidly \nevolving procedures for handling mentally ill offenders and impending factual mootness. \n \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 43   Filed 04/09/09   Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 202\nVI.  Trial Date \n \nThe presumptive trial date is 18 months from the Anchor Date.  This would be a trial date \nin April 2010.  The trial would be by the Court and is anticipated to take at least two \nweeks.  \n \nVII.  Referral to Magistrate Judge   \n \n  The parties wish to discuss this during the conference with the Magistrate Judge.  \n \nVIII.  Required Pre-Trial Preparation \n \nA.  TWO WEEKS BEFORE  THE FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE, the \nparties shall: \n \n1.   File a list of witnesses who are expected to be called to testify at \ntrial. \n \n  2.   Number in sequential order all exhibits, including graphs, charts \n  and the like, that will be used during the trial.  Provide the Court \n  with a list of these exhibits, including a description of each exhibit \n  and the identifying designation.  Make the original exhibits \n  available for inspection by opposing counsel.  Stipulations as to the \n  authenticity and admissibility of exhibits are encouraged to the \n  greatest extent possible. \n \n3.  Submit all stipulations of facts in writing to the Court.  Stipulations  \nare always encouraged so that at trial, counsel can concentrate on \nrelevant contested facts. \n \n4.  A party who intends to offer any depositions into evidence during \nthe party's case in chief shall prepare and file with the Court and \ncopy to all opposing parties either: \n \na.   brief written summaries of the relevant facts in the \ndepositions that will be offered.  (Because such a summary \nwill be used in lieu of the actual deposition testimony  to \neliminate time reading depositions in a question and answer \nformat, this is strongly encouraged.); or \n \nb.   if a summary is inappropriate, a document which lists the \nportions of the deposition(s), including the specific page \nand line numbers, that will be read, or, in the event of a \nvideo-taped deposition, the portions of the deposition that \nwill be played, designated specifically by counter-numbers. \n \n  5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-01317-TWP-MJD   Document 43   Filed 04/09/09   Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 203\n5.

Notify the Court and opposing counsel of the anticipated use of \nany evidence presentation equipment. \n \nB. ONE WEEK BEFORE  THE FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE, the \nparties shall: \n \n1.  Notify opposing counsel in writing of any objections to the proposed \nexhibits.  If the parties desire a ruling on the objection prior to trial, a \nmotion should be filed noting the objection and a description and \ndesignation of the exhibit, the basis of the objection, and the legal \nauthorities supporting the objection. \n \n2.  If a party has an objection to the deposition summary or to a designated \nportion of a deposition that will be offered at trial, or if a party intends to \noffer additional portions at trial in response to the opponent's designation, \nand the parties desire a ruling on the objection prior to trial, the party shall \nsubmit the objections and counter summaries or designations to the Court \nin writing.  Any objections shall be made in the same manner as for \nproposed exhibits.  However, in the case of objections to video-taped \ndepositions, the objections shall be brought to the Court's immediate \nattention to allow adequate time for editing of the deposition prior to trial. \n \n3.  File objections to any motions in limine, proposed instructions, and voir \ndire questions submitted by the opposing parties. \n \n4.

(Filing No. 496.) On \nMarch 18, 2016, this Court held a fairness hearing pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, to determine whether the proposed settlement is a fair, reasonable, and adequate \nresolution of this matter.  The parties appeared by counsel at the hearing.  The parties addressed \nthe Court concerning the history of the litigation and the process and content of the proposed \nsettlement. \n  Having considered the Private Settlement Agreement and the reports of class counsel \n(Filing Nos. 502 and 505), as well as the presentations of counsel at the fairness hearing and the \nrecord in this matter, the Court finds as follows: \n1.   This action was filed on October 1, 2008, and alleged that the confinement of \nseriously mentally ill prisoners in segregation or segregation-like conditions violated, among other \n\nthings, the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n2.   On April 7, 2010, this Court certified this case as a class action with the class \nrepresented by the three prisoner named plaintiffs and defined as: \nall current and future mentally ill prisoners who are committed to the Indiana \nDepartment of  Correction and who are housed in settings in Department of \nCorrection institutions or in the New Castle Correctional Facility that feature \nextended  periods  of  time  in  cells,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  prisoners  in \ndisciplinary  segregation,  administrative  segregation,  or  in  the  New  Castle \nPsychiatric Unit. \n \n(Filing No. 109). \n3.   On December 31, 2012, after a bench trial on the question of liability, this Court \nissued its Entry (Filing No. 279) concluding that “Plaintiffs have prevailed as to their Eighth \nAmendment claim,” although the Court did not issue final judgment because the appropriate relief \nhad not been determined.  \n4.   No final judgment has been entered in this case since that time. \n5.   The Private Settlement Agreement is designed to settle all pending matters in this \nlitigation. \n6.   This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over all the \nparties, including the members of the certified class. \n7.   The class has been given proper and adequate notice of the proposed resolution of \nthis case through the Private Settlement Agreement.  This notice was given as required by the \nCourt’s Order of January 28, 2016.  (Filing No. 498.)  The notice invited class members to notify \nclass counsel as to any objections to, or comments on, the proposed Private Settlement Agreement.  \nThe notice provided valid, due, and sufficient notification of these proceedings and the proposed \nsettlement and included information regarding the procedures for making comments to the Private \nSettlement Agreement.  \n2 \n \n\n8.   The notice to the class fully satisfied the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure and the requirements of due process. \n9.   The Court has reviewed the comments made. \n10.   Following the standards established by Synfuel Technologies, Inv. v. DHL Express, \nInc., 463 F.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir. 2006), the Court finds that the Private Settlement Agreement, and \nthe ultimate dismissal of this action as contemplated by the Private Settlement Agreement, to be \nfair, reasonable, and adequate for the following reasons: \na.   The purpose of this litigation was to prevent the practice of placing seriously \nmentally ill prisoners into segregation or segregation-like environments and to ensure that \nthese prisoners’ mental health needs are adequately addressed.  The Private Settlement \nAgreement provides generally that all seriously mentally ill prisoners who desire to be \nremoved from segregation or segregation-like environments will no longer be housed there \nfor longer than 30 days and will be provided adequate mental health treatment.  The \nproposed Private Settlement Agreement provides for the mental health care of all members \nof the class.  Thus, it appears to the Court that the proposed Private Settlement Agreement \nlargely accomplishes the litigation goals of the plaintiffs.  Given the current status of the \ncase, the Court finds that the comparison of the strength of this case with the settlement \npresented favors recognizing that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \nb.   The complexity, length, and expense of continued litigation weigh in favor \nof finding that the Private Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  Given \nthe significant changes made by the Indiana Department of Correction since the 2011 trial \nin this case, continued litigation would require a new and lengthy evidentiary hearing and \nextensive trial preparation, including further discovery, and it is unclear to the Court that a \n3 \n \n\nbetter result than that presented in the Private Settlement Agreement could be attained by \nplaintiffs even if they were to be successful at an evidentiary hearing.  Paragraphs 67-68 of \nthe Private Settlement Agreement allow plaintiffs to reinstate this action if the Private \nSettlement Agreement is not, in plaintiffs’ estimation, successful in remedying the alleged \nproblems that gave rise to this litigation.  This additional safeguard further demonstrates, \nin the Court’s opinion, that the Private Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate. \nc.   As indicated, the Court has reviewed the reports filed by plaintiffs’ counsel \nconcerning the comments of prisoners who have responded to the notice of the proposed \nsettlement and has reviewed the comments that have been filed.  The Court has no opinion \nconcerning the factual or legal merit of the comments.  However, the Court notes that few \nprisoners actually object to the settlement itself and that by far the largest percentage of \nrelevant comments are from prisoners who believe that they should be in one of the \ntreatment units that have been established.  The Court is confident that plaintiffs’ counsel \nwill continue to monitor this and will continue to bring to the attention of defendant’s \ncounsel the cases of prisoners who believe they should not be in restrictive housing because \nthey believe themselves to be seriously mentally ill.  In turn, the defendant’s counsel will \nsupply or provide access to pertinent information to address these concerns.  In short, the \nCourt does not find the level of opposition to the Private Settlement Agreement to be \nsufficient for the Court to question that it is a fair, reasonable, and adequate resolution of \nthis matter. \nd.   There is no evidence of any collusion between the parties entering into the \nPrivate  Settlement  Agreement.    The  Court  is  satisfied  that  the  Private  Settlement \n4 \n \n\nAgreement is the result of arms-length negotiations. \ne. The class is represented by counsel who are experienced in class action\nlitigation of this type. \nf. The stage of the proceedings and amount of discovery weigh in favor of\nfinding that the Private Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The \nsettlement was arrived at only after lengthy discovery, a trial, and lengthy negotiations. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Private Settlement Agreement is a fair, \nreasonable, and adequate resolution of this matter.  The Court has also found that it is appropriate \nat this time that the approval of the Private Settlement Agreement be issued in the form of Final \nJudgment. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Private Settlement Agreement will remain \nactively in effect for three (3) years from the date of this Order.  At that time, absent written \nagreement  as  noted  in  paragraph  71  of  the  Private  Settlement  Agreement,  this  case  will \nautomatically be dismissed without prejudice. \nAND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, inasmuch as all claims have been resolved \nagainst all parties, this Entry shall constitute the Final Judgment in this action and through its \nissuance the action shall be dismissed without prejudice, subject to all the provisions of the Private \nSettlement Agreement, which is approved and incorporated herein. \nSO ORDERED. \nDate:  __0_3_/_2_4_/2_0_1_6____ \n5 \n\nDISTRIBUTION: \n \nGavin Minor Rose  \nACLU OF INDIANA  \ngrose@aclu-in.org  \n \nKenneth J.
