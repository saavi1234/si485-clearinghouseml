The plaintiff, representing himself pro se, asked the Court for injunctive and declaratory relief requiring defendants to consider his requests for religious accommodation. </p><p>The plaintiff is an observant Jew and has continued his practice of Judaism while incarcerated. Plaintiff's sincerely held religious beliefs dictate that he drink at least 3.5 ounces of red wine while saying Kiddush, a prayer sanctifying the Sabbath, during Friday night and Saturday Shabbos services. Plaintiff believes that wine must be used because it has been dictated by the Code of Jewish Law and by practice. Plaintiff also believes that he must drink four cups containing at least 3.5 ounces of wine during the Passover Seder. Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") staff denied plaintiff's request to be provided with wine for the Kiddush and Passover observances and instead provided grape juice.    </p><p>On September 24, 2008, the parties entered a Stipulation of Settlement and Dismissal agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, FCI will spend up to $500 on religious materials. FCI will also provide plaintiff with challah bread for his Friday night and Saturday morning Sabbath observances and Rosh Hashanah, a cup of at least 3 ounces of nonalcoholic wine on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings, and 4 cups of at least 3 ounces of nonalcoholic wine during the two Passover Seders and other specified religious observances. The terms of the agreement are limited to the current term of plaintiff's incarceration and each party agreed to bear their own costs and fees. </p>",

The  plaintiff  is  an  obsecvant  Jew. _  Plaintiff,;>cacticed \nJudais'il  befoee  his  incarceration  and  continues  his  ,;>cactice \nof  JudaisLa -while  confined.  Plaintiff  f-cequently  attends  Jewish \nseevices,  eveDts,  etc  -and  is  cuceently  the  liason  between \nthe  Jewish  cOlMiunity  and  chaplaincy  staff  at _ his  ,;>lace  of \nincd:cce-e a tion. \n9.

Accocding  to  plaintiff ,  the  Tocah  desccibes  the  Jewish \npeople's  tcansi tion  fcom.s lavecy  to' fr·eedom  using  four  different \nwocds  to  indicate  four  stages' of·transfoc,nation.

Plaintiff  cequested  BOP  staff  to  either peovide,or  'pecmit \nhLu  to  pucchase,  wine  foe  the  Kiddush  and  Passover  obse'cvances. \nDefendant  Watts,  acting on  behalf. of  defendant Lappin,  (signatocy \nauthoei ty  foe  geievance  ces'ponses  in  the  j30P' s  Centcal  Office \nhas  been  delegated  by  the  Director  of  the  Bureau  of  Prisons \nto  the  National  Inamte  Ap?eals  Administ'ca toe.  See  28  C.F.R. \n§  542.11 Ca) (4))  denied  the  .cequest. \n14.  Defendant  Watts'  denial  ·was  pr-emised  on  the  Regional \nDicectoc's  decision  in  Remedy  ID  #  349793-R1  which  ?covides \nthat,  \"the  decision on  whether  oc  not  to  allow  inmate  consumption \nof  wine  du·cing.

The  Jewish  contractor  has  chosen \nnot  to  use  wine,  but  rather  grape  juice  in  the  service.\" \nFurthermore,  defendant  watts'  denial  included  consideration \nof  BOP  Program  state,nent  5360.08,  Religious  Beliefs  and \nPractices,  which  indicates  that  inmat·es  .may  receive  wine  as \npart  of  a  religious  ritual  but,  only  when  administered  under \nthe  supervision  of  clergy  authorized  by  the  BOP  to  perform  the \nritual. \nCOUNT  ONE \n15.  Defendant  watts'  denial  of  plaintiff's.  request  for  wine \nis  inconsistent with  the  requirements  of  RFRA  and  R~UIPA. \n16.  First,  instead  of  gauging  plaintiff's  request  for  wine \nagainst  plaintiff's  religious  beliefs,  watts  impermissibly \nshifted  the  inquiry  to  the  religious  beliefs. of another  person \nthe  contract  Rabbi.  However,  under  RFRA,  RLUIPA,  and  this \ncircuit's precedents,  this  was  error.  See .Henderson  v.  Kennedy, \n265  F.3d  1072,  1073  (D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (the  term  \"exercise  of \nreligion\"  inlcudes  any  exercise  of  religion,  whether  or  not \ncompelled  by,  or  central  to,  a  system  of  religious  belief); \nLevitan  v.  Ashcroft,  281  F.3d  1313,  1322  (D.C.  Cir.  2002)  (the \nfact  that  some  other  Catholics  only  consume  the  species  of  bread \nis  not  dispositive,  nor  are  the  statements  of  clergy  that  the \ntaking  of  wine  by  congregants  is  not  a  mandatory  element  of \nthe  ritual)  (emphasis  added). \n17.  Sacond,  as  discussed  previously,  this  denial  substantially \nburdens  plaintiff's  exercise  of  religion  because  the  taking \nof  wine  during  Kiddush  ·and  Passover  is  not  only  \"central\"  to \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 1      Filed 03/22/2005     Page 5 of 7\nQ \npl,tintiff's  religious  practice,  but  also  is  i.nporatimt  and  is \nbased  on  plaintiff's  sincere  beliefs.  Levitan,  281  F.3d  at \n1321  (In  other - cases,  in  which  the  practice  is  indisputably \nan  important -coffiponent  of  the  litigant's  religious  sche,ne,  such \nevidence  ,nay  be  relevant  to  oVerCO,lle  and  claim- that  the  impact \nof  the  challenged  law  is  de  minimis.  Moreover,  a  rule  that \nbans  a  practice  might  n::metheless  -impose  a  substantial  burden, \nif  the  practice  is  important  and  based  on  a  sincere  religious \nbelief) . \n18.  Third,  in  denying  plaintiff's  reque~t,  defendant  Watts \ndid  not  assert  a  c:>mpelling - g:::>vernmental  interest  nor  did  he \nconsider  if  his  outright  denial  was  the  least  restrictive  ffieans \n~ \nin handling  plaintiff's request. \n19.  Fourth,  reliance  on  P.S.  5360.08  and  its  requirement  that \na  Rabbi  administer  wine  violates  RF1VI.  and  RLUIPA.  This  is \nbecause  such  requirement  places  plaintiff  in  a  \"catch  22\" \nplaintiff  cannot  receive  the  wine  without  a  Rabbi,  but  no  Rabbi \nwill  co.ne  to  the  prison  on  Shabbat  or  Pass:>ver  to  participate \nin  the  service,  ffiuch  less  to  administer  wine,'  because  Jewish \nlaw  prohibits  driving  during  these  times.  This  policy  does \nn:>t  represent  the  least restrictive means  in handling  plaintiff's \nrequest  for  wine. \n20.  Instead  of  requiting  a  Rabbi  to  administer  wine,  other \nBOP  staff,  such  as  the  instituti:>n  chaplain,  can  administer \nwine  to  the  plaintiff.  Currently,  the  institution  chaplain \nprovides  grape  juice,  candles,  natzoh,  a  lightar,  and  ot.her \nreligi:>us  acoutrements  to  tha  plaintiff.  For  the  purposes  of \n--------,----- ------\n----~ \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 1      Filed 03/22/2005     Page 6 of 7\n.RFRA  and  RLUIPA,  there  is  no  s:i,gnificant  difference  between \na  Rabbi  and  the  institution  chaplain  administering  wine  and \nother  items  to  the  plaintiff. \n21.  Fifth,  wine  is  presently  provided  to  other  Jewish  and \nCatholic  inmates  in the  BOP. \n22.  Sixth,  M.anishewitz  .makes  a  low  alcohol  content  wine  that \ncan  be  used  in  lieu of  regular  wine  to  prevent  drunkenness. \nCOUNT  TWO \n23.  As  evident  by  the  allegations  in  paragraphs  8-22  of  this \ncomplaint,  defendant  .Lappin  has  failed  to  train,  supervise, \nand  promulgate  policies  requiring  hi.s  subordinates  to  co:nply \nwith  RFRA  and  RLUIPA.  Because  of  this,  plantiff's  statutory \nrights  have,  and  will  continue,  to  be  violated. \nRelief  Requested \n24.  Plaintiff  seeks  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  requiring \ndefendants  to: \n(1)  Stop  making  the  religious  beliefs  of  other  persons,  such \nas  the  Rabbi  in  the  instant  case,  dispositive  of  plaintiff's \nrequest  for  religious  accom:nodation; \n(2)  Conside.r  plaintiff's  requests  for  religious  accommodation \nconsisteht  .with  plaintiff's  sincere  and  important  religious \nbeliefs; \n(3)  Consider,  c;msistent  with  RFRA  and  RLUIPA,  plaintiff's \nrequests  for  religious  accommodation  irrespective  of  whether \nthe  practice at  issue  is  mandatory; \n(4)  Provide  plaintiff  with  at  least  3.5  ounces  of  kosher  red \nwine  for  Kiddush  on  Friday nights  and  Saturday  shabbos  services; \n---,-\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 1      Filed 03/22/2o005      Page 7 of 7\n(5)  Provide  plaintiff  with  four  cups  containing  at  least  3.5 \nounces  of  kosher  red  wine  to  be  drunk  during  the  Passover  seder; \nand \n(6)  Promulgate  . polcies  and  train  BOP  staff  to  consider \nplaintiff's.  requests·  for  religious  accommodation  consistent \nwith  the  RFRA,  RLUIPA,  and  circuit precedent. \nPlaintiff  further  seeks  costs  and  attorney's  fees,  if \napplicable. \nVerfication \nI  declare  under  penalty  of  perj ury  that  the  foregoing  is \ntrue  and  correct.  28  u.s.c.  §  1746.

Defendants\nbelieve that this transfer has rendered this case moot because\nthe inmate is in a new institution with other prison\nadministrators and the decision denying the wine that led to the\nfiling of this complaint was made under the Bureau of Prisons’\n(“BOP”) past version of then program statement 5380.08, Religious\nBeliefs and Practices, which was effective from August 25, 1997\nuntil December 30, 2004.  \nPlaintiff was transferred from Beaumont Low because he\nchanged his release address to a location in Jesup, and requested\nto be transferred to Jesup, Georgia.  See Declaration of Dee-Ann\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 4 of 25\nStephens (“Stephens Decl.”) (Attachment 1).  Plaintiff arrived at\nthe Federal Correctional Institution in Jesup, Georgia, on\nFebruary 16, 2006.  The Warden and the prison administrators at\nJesup, Georgia, are different from those at Beaumont Low; the\ndecision made at Beaumont Low is not binding on the Jesup\nadministrators; and Plaintiff has not exhausted the BOP\nadministrative remedy procedures under the new policy and in the\nnew institution.  See Declaration of Carolyn Lanphear (“Lanphear\nDecl.”) (Attachment 2).  Thus, insofar as Plaintiff has sought to\nchallenge the decision not to afford him his desired amount of\nwine under the practice adopted by his past warden, this action\nis moot; and his failure to exhaust administrative remedies at\nhis new institution so that his request can be considered in\nlight of the safety and security concerns at that new facility\nand under the new policy bars this action. \nTHE PLAINTIFF’S TRANSFER TO JESUP, GEORGIA\nAND THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT TO THE BUREAU OF PRISONS\n  RELIGIOUS POLICY HAVE RENDERED THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE MOOT\n“No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper\nrole in our system of government than the constitutional\nlimitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or\ncontroversies.”  Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights\nOrganization, 426 U.S. 26, 37 (1976) (citation omitted).  Article\nIII of the Constitution limits our jurisdiction to \"actual,\nongoing controversies.\" Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317 (1988). \n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 5 of 25\nThe power of the courts does not extend to moot cases.  People\nfor the Ethical Treatment of Animals, 396 F.3d 416 (D.C. Cir.\n2005) (citing Central Soya Company v. Consolidated Rail\nCorporation, 614 F.2d 684, 689 (7th Cir. 1980).  Therefore, a\nfederal court cannot decide a question which will not affect the\nrights of the litigation and must resolve the mootness issue\nbefore assuming jurisdiction over such a case.  Pharmachemie B.V.\nv. Barr Laboratories, 276 F.3d 627, 631 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \n\"If events outrun the controversy such that the court can\ngrant no meaningful relief, the case must be dismissed as moot.\" \nMcBryde v. Comm. to Review, 264 F.3d 52, 55 (D.C. Cir. 2001),\ncert. denied, 537 U.S. 821 (2002).  Thus, there must be a live\ncontroversy throughout all stages of the case or the case will be\nmoot.  Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197 (11th Cir. 1989).\nIn Ross v. Reed, 719 F.2d 689 (4th Cir. 1983), mootness was\ndiscussed in the context of a prisoner's continued ability to\nseek relief after transfer:\nTo be justiciable under Article III of the\nConstitution, the conflict between the litigants must\npresent a \"case or controversy\" both at the time the\nlawsuit is filed and at the time it is decided.  If\nintervening factual or legal events effectively dispel\nthe case or controversy during pendency of the suit,\nthe federal courts are powerless to decide the\nquestions presented.\n719 F.2d at 693-94.  Because the inmate in that litigation was no\nlonger incarcerated under the conditions he claimed to be\nunconstitutional, and he himself would no longer be affected by\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 6 of 25\nany relief fashioned by the Court, it was held that there was no\njusticiable case or controversy and those claims were dismissed.\nLikewise in Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1 (1988), where one\nprisoner had died during the litigation and the other had been\nreleased, the case was moot before judgment had been entered and\ntherefore the parties were not entitled to relief.  Once an\ninmate who complains about conditions of confinement is no longer\nsubject to those conditions, the case is moot.  See, Forbes v.\nTrigg, 976 F.2d 308 (7th Cir. 1992), Strader v. Blalock, 405\nF.Supp. 1155 (W.D. Va. 1975);  see also, Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S.\n478 (1982); Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968).\nSimilarly, in this case, Plaintiff Brandon Sample has been\ntransferred to Jesup, Georgia which is administered by different\nprison administrators.  The decision of Beaumont prison\nadministrators to deny him wine is not binding in Jesup.  Thus,\nPlaintiff is no longer subjected to the denial of the wine under\nthe decision reached while he was housed at Beaumont Low, and he\nhas not formally requested the wine through the appropriate\nadministrative remedy procedures at Jesup.  \nMoreover, on December 31, 2004, the BOP issued a new policy\non Religious Beliefs and Practices, Program Statement 5360.09. \nThe amendment of old regulations is among those “intervening\nevents as can moot a challenge to the regulation in its original\nform.” Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Clark, 725 F.2d\n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 7 of 25\n1422, 1432 n.27 (D.C. Cir. 1984)(stating that “[t]here is no\nquestion that a case can be mooted by promulgation of new\nregulations or by amendment or revocation of old regulations.”);\nsee also Natural Res. Def. Council v. United States Nuclear\nRegulatory Comm'n, 680 F.2d 810, 813-815 (D.C. Cir. 1982)\n(stating that “[c]orrective action by an agency is one type of\nsubsequent development that can moot a previously justiciable\nissue.”)\nIn this case, the BOP amended its religious policy statement\non December 31, 2004, which was subsequent to the filing of the\nPlaintiff’s old administrative requests.  This new program\nstatement incorporates elements of the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act (“RFRA”) that were not explicitly identified in\nthe policy under which the Plaintiff’s Beaumont Low requests were\ndenied.  The new policy explains to prison administrators that\n“[w]hen necessary, Wardens may identify alternative practices and\nimplement the least restrictive alternative consistent with the\nsecurity and orderly running of Bureau institutions.”  Program\nStatement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices, at page 5\n(December 31, 2004).  Thus, the new policy substantively changed\nthe guidance provided to prison administrators thereby rendering\nthe Plaintiff’s case moot.  \nFurthermore, the Court is not able to provide the Plaintiff\nwith the injunctive relief he is seeking.  The inmate is no\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 8 of 25\nlonger housed at Beaumont Low and an order by the Court addressed\nto the Beaumont Low officials will have no effect because the\nPlaintiff is no longer housed at Beaumont Low.  Moreover, the BOP\nhas amended its policy since the filing of the case.  Under these\ncircumstances, the Court cannot fashion an appropriate remedy.    \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff’s complaint should be dismissed\nas the matter in controversy, insofar as it may have been ripe\nfor review, is now moot.\nPLAINTIFF HAS NOT EXHAUSTED THE BUREAU OF PRISONS\nADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY PROCEDURES AT FCI JESUP\nDefendants submit that Plaintiff does not currently have any\njudicial remedies available to him.  The BOP religious policy was\namended on December 31, 2004, after the Plaintiff exhausted the\nadministrative remedy procedures.  Plaintiff was transferred to\nJesup, Georgia on February 16, 2006.  However, to this date, the\nPlaintiff has not filed any administrative remedy requests for\nthe wine at Jesup, Georgia.  See Lanphear Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.     \nInstead, Plaintiff filed two Inmate Requests to Staff, which\nare informal requests filed at the institution level and do not\nconstitute the required administrative remedy procedures.  See 28\nC.F.R. Part 542; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).  The first request for the\nwine was addressed to the institution chaplain.  The institution\nchaplain denied the request.  See Attachment 3.  The second\nrequest was addressed to the Warden.  See Attachment 4.  The\nWarden offered Plaintiff non-alcoholic red wine.  See Attachment\n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 9 of 25\n4.2 \nClearly, under these circumstances, the Plaintiff needs to\nexhaust the BOP administrative remedy procedures.  The inmate is\nnow housed in a different institution with different prison\nadministrators and regional director; there is a new policy in\neffect; and at least some wine has been offered to Plaintiff at\nthis new institution.  The balance of equities as well as the\ntext and spirit of the PLRA (42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)) mandate that\nthis inmate be required to exhaust the administrative remedy\nprocedures so that his current institution, the regional\ndirector, and central office have the opportunity to review\nPlaintiff’s request in light of the amended policy and any\ndiffering security circumstances at FCI Jesup.  Thus, this case\nshould be dismissed.\n2  Plaintiff has not rejected this option but requested\ninformation as to whether the non-alcoholic wine was Kosher.  See\nAttachment 5.  The Warden explained that no research had been\ndone on Kosher wine as the inmate did not specify Kosher in his\ninformal request.  The Warden also asked whether the non-\nalcoholic wine would satisfy his request or he was now requesting\nKosher wine as the initial request made no reference to Kosher. \nSee Attachment 5.  As of this date, the inmate has not responded\nto the Warden’s inquiry.  Since the inmate has not exhausted the\nBOP administrative remedy procedures, it is unknown whether the\nnon-alcoholic wine would satisfy the inmate’s request for the\nwine and whether this is a matter that can definitely be\nestablished at Jesup, Georgia as the administration is looking\ninto alternatives to accommodate the inmate’s request.\n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 10 of 25\nTHE PLAINTIFF HAS NOT MET HIS BURDEN OF \nSHOWING HE HAS A SINCERELY HELD BELIEF TO \nDRINK WINE AS PART OF HIS RELIGIOUS PRACTICE\nThis Court found that “[p]laintiff is Jewish and he believes\nthat he must consume a certain quantity of wine – not grape juice\n– as an important part of his observances of the Jewish Sabbath\nand Passover.” March 31, 2006 Mem. Op. at 8-9; Sample v. Lappin,\n2006 WL 833130 at *5 (D.D.C. ).  The Court later explained that\n“[a]t all times relevant to the complaint, plaintiff declares his\nJewish faith, and his religious preference, Jewish, is duly\nreflected in BOP’s records.”  Id.\nA careful reading of the Opinion reflects that inmate Sample\nhas not met his burden to show that he has a sincerely held\nbelief to drink wine as part of the religious rituals.  Instead,\nplaintiff has merely shown that for the last four years he has\nidentified himself as Jewish in the BOP’s records.  His adherence\nto the Jewish faith alone, however, does not show that he has a\nsincerely held belief to drink wine.  Within the prison setting\nand outside the prison setting, many individuals of the Jewish\nfaith utilize grape juice as an adequate substitute to pray\nKiddush and to participate in Passover Seder, and some even pray\nKiddush with just bread, and do not feel that their religious\nrights are being violated.  Thus, the mere fact that plaintiff\nclaims adherence to the Jewish faith does not in itself lead to\nthe conclusion that he has a sincerely held belief to drink wine. \n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 11 of 25\nMoreover, the Plaintiff first came into the BOP custody on\nJune 12, 2000, and identified himself as Jewish on May 18, 2001. \nHowever, he did not request wine for the religious rituals until\nAugust 31, 2004, more than four years after he entered BOP\ncustody.  See Administrative Remedy requests attached to\nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts, Exhibit 2.  If the\nplaintiff had a sincerely held belief to drink wine, it is highly\nsuspect that it took him more than four years to request wine.  A\nreview of the administrative remedy computerized records reflects\nthat since his arrival in BOP custody the Plaintiff has been well\nacquainted with the administrative remedy program.  From the time\nhe came into custody until the time he filed his first\nadministrative remedy request for wine, he filed a total of one\nhundred and twenty nine administrative requests.  See Lanphear\nDecl., ¶¶ 3-4.  None of those requests involved wine for his\nreligious rituals.  This behavior is inconsistent with an inmate\nwith a sincerely held belief to drink wine during the Jewish\nreligious rituals.    This Court recognized part of the\ninconsistencies in Plaintiff’s claimed belief that he required a\ncertain amount of wine to satisfy his religion.  March 31, 2006\nMem. Op. at 8 n.5 (recognizing Plaintiff’s inconsistent\nstatements about the amount of wine he requires -- 3.5 ounces\nversus 3-5 ounces, but concluding that the issue was not\nmaterial, because either amount would be forbidden if the lesser\n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 12 of 25\namount were).  The Court failed to recognize that in Plaintiff’s\ninitial years within the BOP, he never indicated that he needed\nwine.  This offers at least some evidence that his sincerely held\nreligious beliefs have never included a need for any wine. \nPlaintiff merely seized the opportunity to seek wine under the\npretense of a sincerely held belief that coincidentally blossomed\nyears after entering the prison system.  At no time has the\nPlaintiff explained why it took him four years to request the\nwine that he so sincerely believes he must consume during\nreligious rituals.  This is particularly telling, since his\n(controverted) assertion is that he has been of the Jewish faith\nall of his life.    \n   DISCOVERY REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF’S RELIGIOUS\nPRACTICES IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH WHETHER\nPLAINTIFF HAS A SINCERELY HELD BELIEF IN WINE\nIn cases where inmates have been found to hold a sincere\nbelief, this Circuit court has looked at the inmates’ previous\npractices to assess whether there is a sincerely held belief.  In\nLevitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 2002),3 the\ncourt looked at the inmates’ practices and the “record had\nestablished that appellants have regularly attended Mass and\ntaken wine at Communion throughout their incarceration and for\nyears prior to their incarceration.”  In Levitan, the record\n3 Although Levitan involved a claim under the First\nAmendment, the analysis for the sincerely held belief is similar\nunder both standards.\n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 13 of 25\nsupporting the Court’s finding that the plaintiffs had a\nsincerely held belief to drink wine was developed.  In contrast,\nthis record regarding what Plaintiff’s sincerely held religious\nbeliefs are and have been far from uncontroverted. \nIn his previous filings, the Plaintiff relied on Rabbi\nGoldstein’s stipulated information in support of his proposition\nthat “Sample’s beliefs are deeply entrenched in the practice of\nJudaism, and there is no factual question at issue.”  Plaintiff’s\nReply at 6.  The Plaintiff’s reliance on the stipulation is,\nhowever, misplaced.  At no time did Rabbi Goldstein attest to the\ntruthfulness of the Plaintiff’s purported beliefs.  See Rabbi\nGoldstein Stipulation (found as Exhibit E to the Plaintiff’s\nCross-Motion).  Indeed, in the Stipulation, the Rabbi made no\nreference to the Plaintiff or his beliefs or his participation in\nthe Jewish rituals and meetings at Beaumont Low.  Id.  See\nStipulation of Rabbi Goldstein.  Cf. Gartrell v. Ashcroft, 191\nF.Supp.2d 23 (D.D.C. 2002)(where the defendants stipulated the\nPlaintiffs had a sincerely held belief in not shaving or cutting\ntheir hair); Western Presbyterian Church v. Board of Zoning\nAdjustment of District of Columbia, 862 F.Supp. 538 (D.D.C. 1994)\n(where the plaintiffs established that their actions were\nmotivated by a sincerely held belief and the defendants did not\nchallenge the plaintiff on that point).  \nDefendants in this case clearly did not stipulate to the\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 14 of 25\nPlaintiff’s assertion that he has a sincerely held belief in\nwine.  Indeed, Defendants have challenged Plaintiff’s conclusory\nstatements about his belief in drinking wine in the amounts he\nseeks as there is no information or documentation on this record\nto support those assertions.  The Plaintiff makes conclusory\nstatements that he has been active in the practice of the Jewish\nfaith at the different BOP institutions in which he has been\nhoused.  See Declaration of Brandon Sample, ¶ 21 (attached as\nExhibit 1 to the Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities\nin Support of Plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment as to\nCount I).  However, no discovery has been conducted into the\naccuracy of those assertions.  Indeed, this Court takes the\nPlaintiff’s statements at face value with no corroboration even\nin light of the defendants’ persistent challenges.\nThis Court has intertwined the Plaintiff’s religious\npractices in the Jewish rituals with a belief in drinking wine. \nParticipating in the Jewish rituals generally, however, does not\nnecessarily mean the Plaintiff has a sincerely held belief in the\nneed to drink wine or in drinking wine in the amounts Plaintiff\nrequests.  Many Jewish individuals participate in their religious\nrituals with the use of grape juice.  In light of these reasons,\nthis Court should allow the defendants to seek discovery about\nthe plaintiff’s alleged sincerely held belief in drinking red\nwine in the amounts he seeks.  \n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 15 of 25\nWhen initially opposing Plaintiff’s request for summary\njudgment, Defendants did not believe that discovery was necessary\nin order to raise a genuine issue as to Plaintiff’s sincerely\nheld religious beliefs regarding wine.  Indeed, Defendants\nmaintain that material issues are already evidenced by\nPlaintiff’s impeaching convictions and the evidence already\navailable about Plaintiff’s numerous inconsistencies in his\nstatements and actions.  Nevertheless, Defendants have attached a\ndeclaration in an effort to show why discovery is needed, should\nthe Court not find sufficient reason in the earlier record to\nquestion the sincerity of Plaintiff’s religious belief that he\nneeds wine, needs 3.5 ounces of wine, or needs 3-5 ounces of\nwine.  See Declaration of Alma Lopez.  \nThe discovery that is needed would include an assessment of\nthe truth of his claim that Plaintiff has always practiced\nJudaism, as he asserts, including any historical use of wine by\nPlaintiff in religious ceremonies.  Among those who would have\nthis information would be the members of his family.  And, at\nleast Plaintiff’s mother is now living in Jesup, Georgia, where\nPlaintiff is also now housed at his request.  See Stephens Decl.,\n¶ 3.  Thus, not only would transfer to Georgia make discovery\nfrom Plaintiff more accessible, it would make discovery from his\nfamily, such as depositions, more convenient to the parties and\n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 16 of 25\nwitnesses.4\nThus, this case should be transferred to the Southern\nDistrict of Georgia as Plaintiff and his records, and the prison\nadministrators, current custodian of the plaintiff, are located\nin Georgia.\nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION HAS NO MERIT\nAS DEFENDANTS HAVE SHOWN THE EXISTENCE OF A COMPELLING\nGOVERNMENTAL INTEREST IN NOT GIVING WINE TO THE PLAINTIFF\nThe Plaintiff challenges this Court’s finding that the BOP\nhas shown a compelling governmental interest in support of its\ndenial of the Plaintiff’s request for wine.  The Plaintiff relies\non the recent Supreme Court decision in Gonzales v. Centro\nEsperita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 1220\n(2006) in support of his proposition that “the compelling\ninterest is satisfied through application of the challenged law\n‘to the person’ - - the particular claimant whose sincere\nexercise of religion is being substantially burdened.”  He\ncontends that the BOP has not met its burden as the defendants do\nnot explain how not giving wine to the Plaintiff rises to an\ninterest of the highest order.  The Plaintiff then asserts that\nBOP policy allows two ounces of alcohol for religious purposes. \n4  Specifically, counsel would be assigned from the United\nStates Attorney’s office in that district and that attorney would\nnot have to travel long distances at significant cost to take\ndepositions.  Similarly, if a trial ever took place, expensive\ntransportation costs and inconvenience of plaintiff and his\nfamily members would be avoided if the action were pending where\nthey live.  \n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 17 of 25\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration at 4-5.  The arguments the\nPlaintiff advances in his motion for reconsideration clearly have\nno merit.\nIn Centro, the Supreme Court commenced its analysis by\nstating that “. . . the Federal Government may not, as a\nstatutory matter, substantially burden a person’s exercise of\nreligion, ‘even if the burden results from a result of general\napplicability.’  The only exception recognized by the statute\nrequires the Government to satisfy the compelling interest test-\nto ‘demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person-\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.’” Centro, supra, at 1217.  The Court\nexplained that the Government must prove that the compelling\ngovernment interest is satisfied through the application of the\npolicy to the individual.  Id. at 1220.  The Court further\nexplained that through the development of the case law the court\nhas looked at the harm that would ensue from granting exemptions\nto rules of general applicability, and have still permitted\nexemptions.  Id.  The Court explained, however, that the\ncompelling government interest test is not rigid and it allows\n“for a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to\nthe facts of each particular claim.”  Id. at 1221 (quoting\nEmployment Div., Dept. Of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494\n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 18 of 25\nU.S. 872, 899 (1990)).  The Court further explained “. . . that\n‘[c]ontext matters’ in applying the compelling test, . . ., and\n. . . ‘strict scrutiny does take ‘relevant differences’ into\naccount-indeed, that is its fundamental purpose.’”  Id.\nThe instant case is distinguishable from Centro, supra. \nCentro did not address the uniqueness and complexity of the\nconsiderations existing in the prison setting when dealing with\nthe use of intoxicants.  Moreover, in Centro, the government\ncompletely barred the use of hoasca for religious rituals. \nHowever, the statute at issue allowed the use of peyote for the\nNative American religions even though the analysis under the\nControlled Substance Act and the compelling government interest\ntest would apply equally to both substances.  126 S.Ct. 1222-23. \nAlthough Congress intended only one compelling governmental\ninterest test to apply in both contexts, prison and the free\ncommunity, the outcome of the case could vary depending on the\ncontext.  See Hamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1552 (1996).  In\nour case, the BOP policy allows the use of wine in “small\namounts” consistent with the security concerns at the prisons. \nTo allow large amounts of wine as the Plaintiff requests would\nseriously hamper the security of the institution.\nUnder the line of reasoning employed in Centro, it follows\nthat the BOP can impose limitations on the Plaintiff’s religious\nbeliefs through rules of general applicability so long as the BOP\n- 16 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 19 of 25\nshows a compelling governmental interest implemented through the\nleast restrictive means.  Centro, supra at 1217.  The BOP\nadvances a compelling governmental interest through the\napplication of its religious policy to inmates which are allowed\nto receive “small amounts of wine.”\nThe kind of environment and relationship among the inmates\nand staff is unique to the prison setting.  Prison administrators\nare tasked with the challenging responsibility of accommodating\ninmates’ rights and privileges while maintaining the security of\nthe institution.  In so doing, prison administrators must \nconsider the character of the inmates confined in the\ninstitution, recent and longstanding relations between\nprisoners and guards, prisoners inter se, and the like. \nIn the volatile atmosphere of a prison, an inmate may\nconstitute an unacceptable threat to the safety of\nother prisoners and guards even if he himself has\ncommitted no misconduct; rumor, reputation, and even\nmore imponderable factors may suffice to spark\npotentially disastrous incident.  The judgment of\nprison officials . . . turns largely on 'purely\nsubjective evaluations and on predictions of future\nbehavior.'\nHewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 473 (1983)(quoting Connecticut\nBoard of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 464 (1981)).   \nAs explained in Centro, the compelling government interest\nis not applied in a vacuum and equally across the board. \n“Context matters.”  The legislative history of RFRA highlights\nthe importance of addressing the unique characteristics of the\nprison setting and it even designates a section to the distinct\napplication of RFRA in prison.  The legislative history explains:\n- 17 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 20 of 25\nThe RFRA would establish one standard for testing claims of\nGovernment infringement on religious practices.  This single\ntest, however, should be interpreted with regard to the\nrelevant circumstances in each case.  \n* * *\nThe Committee does not intend the Act to impose a standard\nthat would exacerbate the difficult and complex challenges\nof operating the nations’ prisons and jails in a safe and\nsecure manner.  Accordingly, the committee expects that the\ncourts will continue the tradition of giving due deference\nto the experience and expertise of prison and jail\nadministrators in establishing necessary regulations and\nprocedures to maintain good order, security and discipline,\nconsistent with considerations of costs and limited\nresources.\nS. Rep. 103-111, 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1892, 1899-1900 (1993).\nWith this background, the BOP has, quite logically,\ndetermined that alcohol consumption jeopardizes the security of\nthe prisons, and has shown that it has a compelling interest in\nnot allowing the consumption of alcohol in its prisons.  The BOP\nintroduced the Declaration of Linda Thomas, the Assistant\nAdministrator of the Correctional Services Branch, who has\nextensive experience in the areas of security, inmate discipline,\ncase management, and religious services.  Based on her experience\nand knowledge in the area of corrections, Ms. Thomas concludes\nthat “[t]here are legitimate penological interests for\nrestricting inmates access to alcohol, such as security and order\nof the prison, rehabilitation, punishment, deterrence of criminal\nbehavior, and a non-hostile work environment for prison staff.” \nDeclaration of Linda Thomas (attached to the Defendant’s Motion\n- 18 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 21 of 25\nto Dismiss as Exhibit 5).  The declaration distinguishes the\ninmate population from the population at large and explains the\nviolent tendencies of inmates housed in BOP facilities which\ncould be exacerbated by alcohol use.  See id.\nIn spite of the security concerns involved, the BOP has\ncarved an exception to this general rule by allowing inmates to\nreceive “small amounts of wine” as part of their religious\npractices.  The BOP, however, limits the amount of wine to only a\n“small amount of wine.”  This exception advances the government’s\ncompelling interest of maintaining the security of the\ninstitution and meets the RFRA standard. \nThe BOP has also met the compelling interest test as it\nrelates to the Plaintiff himself.  The Plaintiff requests 3 to 5\nounces of wine on Fridays and Saturdays and 4 glasses of 3 to 5\nounces of wine on Passover Seder.  In his Memorandum of Points,\nthe Plaintiff mentions that BOP policy “allows ‘an exception’ to\nits alcohol regulations by allowing for the consumption of two\nounces of regular wine for religious purposes.”  Plaintiff’s Mem.\nat 4.  Contrary to the Plaintiff’s assertion, the BOP still\nallows inmates to receive wine in “small amounts.”  \nThe portion of the policy that the Plaintiff mislabels as an\nexception, is consistent with the policy allowance of “small\namounts of wine,” and refers to the two ounces of wine utilized\nby the Clergy, for instance, during the celebration of mass and\n- 19 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 22 of 25\nthat is shared by all members of the congregation, including the\nClergy.5  This is consistent with the BOP policy of allowing\ninmates “small amounts” and the compelling governmental interest\nin maintaining security of the institution that allows inmates to\nreceive \"small amounts of wine.\" \nThe Plaintiff in this case seeks 3 to 5 ounces of red wine\nduring the Sabbath on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings and\nfour glasses each with 3 to 5 ounces of red wine during Passover\nSeder.  The unique characteristics of the prison setting and the\nsecurity concerns at stake did not allow prison administrators6\nto accommodate the Plaintiff’s request.  In the prison setting, 3\nto 5 ounces of conventional wine is a large amount in light of\nthe security concerns at stake.  Moreover, 4 glasses of 3 to 5\nounces of such wine to be consumed at one time could clearly be\nregarded as a very large amount, up to twenty ounces of wine,\nwhich could seriously compromise the security of the institution. \nThe amount of the wine has to be placed in the proper context,\nthe prison setting, with its unique characteristics and security\n5 During communion, for example, the Catholic Priest places\nthe two ounces of wine in the chalice and takes the bread, dips\nit in the wine, and gives it to the inmate to eat.  The Priest\ndrinks the amount of wine remaining in the chalice.  Thus, two\nounces of wine are used to serve the entire congregation,\nincluding the priest, and not to each inmate. \n6 This assertion applies to Beaumont Low administrators and\ndoes not include the Jesup administrators, as the Plaintiff has\nnot yet exhausted the BOP administrative remedy procedures with\nregards to his request for wine while at Jesup.\n- 20 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 23 of 25\nissues.  The BOP allows inmates to receive small amounts of wine\nand this is consistent with the practice used, for example, in\nthe Catholic mass.  To do otherwise would seriously compromise\nthe security of the institution.  \nClearly, the BOP has established a compelling governmental\ninterest in keeping alcohol consumption out of the prisons and in\nlimiting the use of alcohol in religious services to “small\namounts of wine” based on the security of the institution.  \nTHE COURT’S FINDING THAT BOP DID NOT MEET THE \nLEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE\nThis Court found that the BOP “failed to demonstrate that an\noutright ban at Beaumont Low on this plaintiff’s consumption of\nwine as part of a religious ritual is the least restrictive means\nof furthering the government’s compelling interest. ‘[T]he\ngovernment cannot meet its burden to prove the least restrictive\nmeans unless it has actually considered and rejected the efficacy\nof less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged\npractice.”  March 31, 2006 Mem. Op. at 12-13.\nAs noted above, this portion of the Court’s opinion is moot,\nas the Plaintiff has been transferred to Jesup, Georgia, and\nBeaumont Low officials, who decided not to give Plaintiff wine,\nare no longer involved in his care.  At this point, the inmate\nmust exhaust the BOP administrative remedies at Jesup, since it\nis now unknown how the Plaintiff’s request will be addressed at\nthe new institution, in the new region, and under the new policy. \n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 36      Filed 04/27/2006     Page 24 of 25\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, this action should be dismissed or\nsummary judgment entered in favor of the Defendants.

BACKGROUND\nHaving been convicted of money laundering and other fraud-related offenses,\nplaintiff is a federal prisoner who currently is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution\nin Beaumont, Texas (“Beaumont Low”).  Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 5.  He describes himself as “an\nobservant Jew” who “practiced Judaism before his incarceration and continues his practice of\nJudaism while confined.”  Id. ¶ 8; see Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of\nPlaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count I (“Pl.’s Mot.”), Ex. 1 (“Sample\n1 Defendants also move to transfer this action to the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  The Court will deny the transfer\nmotion without prejudice.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 2 of 14\nDecl.”), ¶¶ 19-23.  He “sincerely believes that he must drink at least 3.5 ounces of red wine (a\nreviit) while saying Kiddush, a prayer sanctifying the Sabbath, during Friday night and Saturday\nshabbos services.”  Compl. ¶ 9; see Sample Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8.  Under Beaumont Low’s current\nprocedures, “[d]uring the Shabbat services,” plaintiff says “Kiddush over grape juice and matzah,\nwhich is contrary to [his] sincerely held belief that a Jewish adult should say Kiddush over a\nglass of wine, and challah bread.”  Sample Decl. ¶ 22.  According to plaintiff, “[s]aying Kiddush\nover grape juice or bread alone is only an acceptable substitute for adults who are sick, and\ncannot consume alcohol.  The ritual of Kiddush is more complete if said over 3 to 5 ounces of\nwine.”  Id. ¶ 8.  In addition, plaintiff  “sincerely believes that he must drink four cups containing\na[t] least 3.5 ounces of wine during the Passover seder.”  Compl. ¶ 10; see Sample Decl. ¶¶ 2, 15. \nThrough the inmate grievance process, plaintiff challenged the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons (“BOP”) regulation which allows inmates to consume wine during religious observances\nonly at the Warden’s discretion.  He asked that BOP either provide wine or permit him to\npurchase wine for consumption during Shabbat and Passover observances.  Compl. ¶ 13; see\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss or, in the\nAlternative, for Summary Judgment or to Transfer (“Defs.’ Mot.”), Attach. A (Request for\nAdministrative Remedy dated Aug. 20, 2004).  Plaintiff also asked BOP either to amend its\npolicy regarding wine for religious rituals, or to “draft an operations memoranda on how\nWardens exercise their discretion in permitting or not permitting wine during religious services.” \nDefs.’ Mot., Attach. A (Request for Administrative Remedy dated Aug. 20, 2004).  Relying on\nProgram Statement 5360.08 (August 22, 2002 Change Notice), Religious Beliefs and Practices,\nthe Warden denied plaintiff’s request, explaining that:\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 3 of 14\nThere is no provision which requires wine be provided for inmate\nconsumption therefore it is at the discretion of the Warden.  Wine has\nbeen deemed a security issue at this institution and therefore is not\nprovided to any religious faith for inmate consumption.  Additionally,\nthe Rabbi has been consulted.  He confirms kosher grape juice as an\nacceptable alternative to wine.  \nDefs.’ Mot., Attach. A (Response to Request for Administrative Remedy #349793-F1 dated\nSeptember 14, 2004).   \nPlaintiff appealed this decision, unsuccessfully, to the Regional Director.  See\nCompl. ¶ 14; Defs.’ Mot., Attach. A (Regional Director Response dated October 22, 2004). \nWith respect to plaintiff’s request on appeal for an amendment to Program Statement 5360.08,\nthe Regional Director responded as follows:\nCurrent Bureau of Prison’s policy provides guidance to staff on the\nuse of wine for religious services.  According to Program Statement\n5360.08 . . ., inmates may be permitted to receive small amounts of\nwine as part of a religious ritual, only when administered under the\nsupervision of clergy authorized by the Bureau of Prisons to perform\nthe ritual.  There is no need to write new policy on this issue.\nDefs.’ Mot., Attach. A (Regional Director Response dated October 22, 2004).  At the last level of\nthe appeal process, the Administrator of National Inmate Appeals concurred with the responses\nprovided by the Warden and Regional Director, and denied the appeal.  Id., Attach. A (National\nInmate Appeals Response dated January 27, 2005).\nPlaintiff alleges that the denial of his request for wine violates the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1 et seq., and the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1 et seq.  Compl. \n¶¶ 1, 15-22 (Count I).  Further, he alleges that BOP’s Director “failed to train, supervise, and \n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 4 of 14\npromulgate policies requiring his subordinates to comply with RFRA and RLUIPA.”  Id. ¶ 23\n(Count II).  He demands declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. ¶ 24.\nII.   DISCUSSION\nA.  Plaintiff Need Not Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n           Regarding Request for Staff Member to Administer Wine\nIn relevant part, the Prison Litigation Reform Act provides that:\nNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\nsection 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner\nconfined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  The exhaustion requirement of Section 1997e(a) is mandatory and\n“applies to all prisoners seeking redress for prison circumstances or occurrences.”  Porter v.\nNussle, 534 U.S. 516, 520 (2002).  Section 1997e(a) “afford[s] corrections officials time and\nopportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case,” and,\nwhere possible, to “satisfy the inmate, thereby obviating the need for litigation.”  Id. at 524-25. \nA prisoner must complete the administrative process “regardless of the relief offered through\nadministrative avenues.”  Booth v. Churner,  532 U.S. 731, 741 (2001).  Thus, a prisoner may\nfile a civil action concerning conditions of confinement under federal law only after he has\nexhausted the BOP’s administrative remedies.  Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262,\n269 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\nIn his inmate grievance, plaintiff challenges the Warden’s decision to prohibit\ninmates’ consumption of wine on the ground that the decision violates federal law, and requests\npermission to drink wine during Sabbath services and the Passover seder.  See Defs.’ Mot.,\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 5 of 14\nAttach. A (Request for Administrative Remedy dated August 20, 2004).  He neither suggests a\nprocedure by which the wine could be provided to him, nor identifies a person to administer the\nwine.  In Count I of his Complaint, plaintiff proposes that “other BOP staff, such as the\ninstitution chaplain, [] administer wine” to him instead of requiring a rabbi to perform this\nfunction.  Compl. ¶ 20.  Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies “with respect to his request that a staff member, other than the Jewish Rabbi, provide\nhim with the wine he seeks.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 4 & Attach. B (Watts Decl.) ¶ 3.2  The Court rejects\nthis argument.\nPlaintiff’s inmate grievance and Complaint are consistent: his  ultimate goal is the\nunburdened exercise of his sincere religious belief.   The record makes clear that plaintiff  has\nexhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his request for wine.  It matters not\nwhether he asked that a rabbi, a chaplain, or a BOP staff member administer the wine to him. \nPlaintiff’s obligation to exhaust his administrative remedies does not require that he posit every\nconceivable alternative means by which to achieve his goal.\nB.  Summary Judgment on Plaintiff’s RFRA Claim\n       Will Be Denied in Part Without Prejudice\n1.  Summary Judgment Standard\nThe Court may grant a motion for summary judgment if the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits or\n2 Defendants also argue that plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies with\nrespect to his request for wine only under BOP Program Statement 5360.08, Religious Beliefs\nand Practices (August 22, 2002 Change Notice), which since has been superceded.  See Defs.’\nMot. at 4 n.1.  Plaintiff cannot be faulted for failing to challenge a policy that was not yet in\neffect at the time he submitted his inmate grievance.\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 6 of 14\ndeclarations, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party bears\nthe burden of demonstrating an absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  A material fact is one “that might affect the outcome of the\nsuit under the governing law.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nWhen evaluating a summary judgment motion, the Court does not make credibility\ndeterminations, weigh the evidence, or draw inferences from the facts found; those are jury\nfunctions, not those of a judge.  Id. at 255; see Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530\nU.S. 133, 150 (2000).  Factual assertions in the moving party’s affidavits may be accepted as true\nunless the opposing party submits his own affidavits or documentary evidence to the contrary. \nNeal v. Kelly, 963 F.2d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  The party opposing a motion for summary\njudgment “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but . . . must set\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. at 248; see also Jackson v. Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner,\n101 F.3d 145, 150 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n2.  Plaintiff’s Prima Facie Case Under RFRA\nPrisoners retain constitutional rights in prison, including the right to the free\nexercise of religion.  See, e.g., Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974) (“prison inmate\nretains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with\nthe legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system”); Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d\n1313, 1317 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Generally, RFRA provides that the federal government “shall not\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 7 of 14\nsubstantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).3  “Thus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\nclaim under RFRA by proving the following three elements: (1) a substantial burden imposed by\nthe federal government on a (2) sincere (3) exercise of religion.”  Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d\n950, 960 (10th Cir. 2001).  If plaintiff successfully makes out his prima facie case, defendants\nthen must show that the burden placed on the religious exercise is permissible.  See Gartrell v.\nAshcroft, 191 F.Supp.2d 23, 37 (D.D.C. 2002) (applying burden-shifting analysis under RFRA). \nA substantial burden on a person’s exercise of religion is permissible only if:\n[the government] demonstrates that application of the burden to the\nperson –\n(1)  is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b).  For purposes of RFRA, the term “demonstrates” means “meets the\nburdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(3).\n3 The Supreme Court instructs that RFRA is unconstitutional insofar as it purports\nto regulate state and local governments.  City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997).  RFRA\nremains valid as applied to the federal government, however.  See Webman v. Federal Bureau of\nPrisons, No. 05-5031, slip. op. at 4 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2006) (recognizing Congress’ “power to\nenforce RFRA against the federal government”); Henderson v. Kennedy, 265 F.3d 1072, 1073\n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (declaring that RLUIPA’s amendments to RFRA regarding exercise of religion\n“remove the doubt . . . that the portion of RFRA remaining after [Flores]. . . survived the\nSupreme Court’s decision striking down the statute as applied to the States”), cert. denied, 540\nU.S. 1218 (2004).  RLUIPA’s amendments to RFRA are applicable.  See Kikumura v. Hurley,\n242 F.3d at 960 (noting RLUIPA’s amendment of RFRA’s definition of term “exercise of\nreligion”).  There is no separate cause of action under RLUIPA, however.  Ish Yerushalayim v.\nUnited States Dep’t of Corr., 374 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2004) (concluding that RLUIPA “clearly\ndoes not create a cause of action against the federal government or its correctional facilities”). \n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 8 of 14\na.  Exercise of Religious Beliefs\nThe term “religious exercise” includes “any exercise of religion, whether or not\ncompelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A).4  The\nexercise in question need not be mandatory.  Cf. Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d at 1319 (finding\nno requirement that consumption of communion wine by Catholic prisoners be mandatory to\nwarrant First Amendment protection).  In this case, there is no genuine issue of material fact that\nthe exercise in question is religious in nature.  It is “an important part of the Jewish religion to\nsay Kiddush over a glass of wine” and to consume “four glasses of wine . . . during the Passover\nSeder.”  Pl.’s Mot., Ex. 3 (Goldstein Stip.) ¶¶ 4, 7-9; see Defs.’ Mot., Attach. (Van Baalen Decl.) \n¶ 13.5 \nb.  Sincerity of Religious Beliefs\n“It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or\npractices to a faith, or the validity of a particular litigant’s interpretation of those creeds.” \nHernandez v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue Serv., 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989).  The Court’s inquiry \n4 RFRA refers to the definition of “religious exercise” set forth in RLUIPA.  See 42\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4).\n5 There appears to be a discrepancy as to the quantity of wine plaintiff believes he\nmust drink.  According to the Complaint, plaintiff alleges that he must consume one cup of wine\nduring Friday and Saturday Shabbat services, and four cups of wine during the Passover seder. \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 9-10.  Each cup of wine must be at least 3.5 ounces.  Id.  In his declaration,\nplaintiff states that he must consume slightly larger quantities, “between 3 to 5 ounces of wine\nevery Friday and Saturday during the saying of Kiddush,” and “3 to 5 ounces of wine four times”\nduring the Passover seder.  Sample Dec. ¶ 2.  It does not appear, however, that the quantity of\nwine is a material fact.  If BOP forbids consumption of a smaller quantity of wine, it is unlikely\nthat it would allow a larger quantity.\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 9 of 14\nis limited to “whether a claimant sincerely holds a particular belief and whether the belief is\nreligious in nature.”  Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 476 (2d Cir. 1996).  \nBased on this record, there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to the\nsincerity of plaintiff’s religious beliefs.  Plaintiff is Jewish and he believes that he must consume\na certain quantity of wine – not grape juice – as an important part of his observances of the\nJewish Sabbath and Passover.  Whether plaintiff declared his Jewish faith at the time of his\nincarceration is of no moment.6  At all times relevant to the complaint, plaintiff declares his\nJewish faith, and his religious preference, Jewish, is duly reflected in BOP’s records.  See Defs.’\nMot., Attach. (Inmate History – Religion). \nc.  Substantial Burden on Exercise of Sincerely Held Religious Beliefs\nPlaintiff completes his prima facie case under RFRA, then, if he shows that\nBOP’s policies substantially burden the exercise of his sincere religious beliefs.  A substantial\nburden exists “where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct \nproscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by\nreligious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to\nviolate his beliefs.”  Jenkins v. Angelone, 948 F.Supp. 543, 546 (E.D.Va. 1996) (quoting Thomas\nv. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-18 (1981)); see Sherbert v.\n6 Defendants question the sincerity of plaintiff’s religious beliefs because he\nallegedly did not declare his religious preference as Jewish upon his initial entry into BOP in\nJune 2000.  See Van Baalen Decl. ¶ 10.  BOP records reflected “religion unknown” initially, then\n“no preference” until May 18, 2001, when records reflect “Protestant.”  See Defs.’ Mot., Attach.\n(Inmate History – Religion).  As of September 17, 2001, BOP’s records reflect plaintiff’s\nreligious preference as “Jewish.”  See id.  The accuracy or inaccuracy of BOP records does not\nnecessarily reflect the sincerity of plaintiff’s religious beliefs.\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 10 of 14\nVerner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963) (award of government benefits would force applicant to\n“choose between following the precepts of her religion . . . and abandoning one of the precepts of\nher religion”).\nRegarding the religious use of wine, BOP regulations in relevant part provide: \nInmates may be permitted to receive small amounts of wine as part of\na religious ritual, only when administered under the supervision of\nclergy authorized by the Bureau of Prisons to perform the ritual.\nBecause wine is otherwise a contraband substance, it can only be\nadministered under strict control and supervision.  Inmates will not\nbe allowed to administer wine to other inmates.  For purposes of this\npolicy, the consumption of wine under these circumstances will not\nbe considered consumption of alcohol or ingestion of an illegal\nsubstance.\nDefs.’ Mot., Attach. C (Program Statement 5360.08, Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sec. 20\n(August 22, 2002 Change Notice)).7  Further, the Program Statement authorizes each institution\nto develop additional policies in the form of an Institution Supplement “for operating religious\nprograms and activities.”  Id., Sec. 22.8  Beaumont Low’s Warden evidently exercised his\ndiscretion by declaring the consumption of wine a security threat, and by refusing to provide \n7 The August 22, 2002 Change Notice to Program Statement 5360.08 was in effect\nat the time plaintiff pursued his inmate grievance.  Neither Program Statement 5360.07 (effective\nAugust 25, 1997) nor the portion of Program Statement 5360.08 (effective May 25, 2001)\namended by the August 22, 2002 Change Notice is relevant here.\n8 The current policy, Program Statement 5360.09 (effective December 31, 2004),\ndirects each institution to develop an Institution Supplement for operating religious programs and\nactivities, which must include “[p]rocedures for religious fasts [and] ceremonial meals” and\n“[p]rocedures and limitations for storage and provision of religious wine.”  Id., Sec. 20.\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 11 of 14\nwine for any inmate’s consumption.  See Defs.’ Mot., Attach. A (Response to Request for\nAdmin. Remedy #349793-F1); Defs.’ Reply at 10-11.9  \nPlaintiff could receive wine for religious services only if Beaumont Low’s\nWarden were to allow wine at the institution, and if an authorized rabbi were to administer the\nwine in the course of the religious ritual.  Clearly the Warden is unwilling to provide plaintiff\nwith wine, regardless of its quantity or alcohol content, and BOP is unwilling to further amend its\npolicies.  Even if plaintiff were allowed a quantity of wine, there would be no rabbi present to\nadminister it.  The contract rabbi visits Beaumont Low only once a month.  Van Baalen Decl. ¶ 5. \nAccording to plaintiff, “Jews are commanded not to work during Shabbat,” and, therefore, the\nrabbi “cannot drive to the prison” for weekly Shabbat services.  Sample Decl. ¶ 22.10  Nor does it\nappear that a rabbi is present for the Passover seder, during which prisoners are supervised by the\nprison chaplain and prison staff.  Id. ¶ 14.  \nCurrently, the BOP regulation and its implementation at Beaumont Low do not\nmerely inconvenience plaintiff.  Rather, plaintiff effectively is prohibited from exercising his\nsincere religious beliefs in consuming wine during Sabbath and Passover services.   Plaintiff\nsuccessfully makes out a prima facie case under RFRA. \n9 Beaumont Low’s Institution Supplement has not been made a part of this record\nby either party.\n10 During discovery, it might be appropriate to determine whether this statement is\ntrue of all rabbis or only Orthodox rabbis.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 12 of 14\n2.  Furthering a Compelling Governmental Interest by the Least Restrictive Means\nThe government’s application of the burden to the person’s exercise of religion is\npermissible only if it furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that interest.  See Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d at 475 (applying RFRA’s\n“compelling interest” test to religious exercise claims of inmate).  The Court considers “whether\nthere is a compelling government reason, advanced in the least restrictive means, to apply the\nprison regulation to the individual claimant.”  Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d at 962 (emphasis\nadded); see Gonzales v. O Centro Esperita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, __ U.S. __, __, 126\nS.Ct. 1211, 1220 (2006) (government must “demonstrate that the compelling interest test is\nsatisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to the person’ – the particular claimant\nwhose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened”).  “[O]nly those interests of\nthe highest order . . . can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.” \nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215 (1972).  \nDefendants argue that the government has a compelling interest in controlling\nalcohol consumption and intoxicants in BOP’s correctional facilities.  Defs.’ Mot. at 29.  Among\nthe legitimate penological interests for restricting inmates’ access to alcohol are “security and\norder of the prison, rehabilitation, punishment, deterrence of criminal behavior, and a non-hostile\nwork environment for prison staff.”  Defs.’ Mot., Attach. (Thomas Decl.) ¶ 4.  Defendants link\nthe availability of intoxicants to violent or otherwise disruptive behavior at BOP facilities, noting\nthat a significant percentage of disciplinary incidents involved violations of the regulation\nprohibiting inmates from making, possessing, or using intoxicants.  Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9.  \n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 13 of 14\nPlaintiff concedes this point, stating that [t]here is no argument that controlling alcohol\nconsumption is a compelling government interest.”  Pl.’s Mot. at 22 .  \nPlaintiff contends – and the Court agrees – that defendants fail to demonstrate that\nan outright ban at Beaumont Low on this plaintiff’s consumption of wine as part of a religious\nritual is the least restrictive means of furthering the government’s compelling interest.  “[T]he\ngovernment cannot meet its burden to prove least restrictive means unless it has actually\nconsidered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged\npractice.”  Gartrell v. Ashcroft, 191 F.Supp.2d at 39.  Recognizing that defendants need not\n“refute every conceivable option in order to satisfy the least restrictive means prong of RFRA,” \nHamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1556 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 874 (1996), this Court\nsimply cannot determine on this record whether the parties meet their respective burdens on\nsummary judgment.  \nBOP policy allows inmates to receive small amounts of wine as part of religious\nrituals under certain controlled circumstances.  The Program Statement at issue does not define\n“small amount,” and the parties’ submissions shed no light on this matter.  Beaumont Low’s\nWarden apparently has chosen to exercise his discretion to bar the religious use of wine for\nreasons that are not explained fully in this record.  Defendants speculate that accommodating\nplaintiff’s request would create an “administrative nightmare” leading to “chaos in prisons.” \nDefs.’ Mot. at 30-31.11  Their assertions  are speculative, unsupported by the current record, and\n11 Defendants worry about the appearance of favoring one Jewish inmate over other\ninmates, whether Jewish or not.  Defs.’ Mot. at 30.  In the alternative, BOP asserts that it would\nbe forced to treat members of other faiths equally, allowing other inmates who sincerely believe\nin consuming wine as part of their religious observances to consume wine in amounts of their\n(continued...)\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 32      Filed 03/31/2006     Page 14 of 14\nneither compelling nor sufficient to meet the government’s burden of showing that an outright\nban is the least restrictive alternative under RFRA. \nIII.   CONCLUSION\nThe Court concludes that plaintiff makes out a prima facie case under RFRA and\nthat defendants establish a compelling government interest in controlling alcohol consumption\nand intoxicants in BOP facilities.  At this stage of the proceedings, neither plaintiff nor\ndefendants have met their respective burdens with respect to the “least restrictive means”\nelement.

In\nshort, Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed because\nPlaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted under the Religious Exercise in Land Use and by\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), which does not apply to\nfederal prisons.  Plaintiff's claim under the Religious Freedom\nand Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") of 1993 are also without merit and\nthe policy Plaintiff seeks to challenge is reasonably related to\na governmental interest under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78\n(1987), and Plaintiff has failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies on at least one of his contentions.  Finally, transfer\nis appropriate, even were any claim to survive the instant\nmotion.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 4 of 52\nARGUMENT\nRLUIPA does not apply to Federal Prisons\nPlaintiff alleges that the denial of his request for a\nreligious accommodation while in federal prison violates RLUIPA. \nRLUIPA applies exclusively to state prisons and has no\napplication in federal prisons.  Ish Yerushalayim v. United\nStates, 374 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 2004); Benning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d\n1299 (11th Cir. 2004).  See also 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2 and cc-5. \nBecause Plaintiff is incarcerated in federal prison and his\ncontentions related to matters that occur while in federal\nprison, RLUIPA does not provide the proper basis to challenge\nactions by federal officials in federal prisons. \nThus, the Plaintiff’s claims under RLUIPA must be dismissed.\nPlaintiff has not exhausted administrative remedies for one\nof his contentions\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), a prisoner\nmust exhaust “such administrative remedies as are available”\nbefore bringing a civil action in federal court.  42 U.S.C.\n§1997e(a).  In Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001), a unanimous\nSupreme Court held that Congress mandated completion of any\nprison administrative remedy process capable of addressing the\ninmate’s complaint and providing some form of relief,\n“irrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 5 of 52\nadministrative avenues.” Id. at 741 n.6.  The remedy system at\nissue in Booth was nearly identical to the three-level process\nused in the federal prison system. Id. at 734; 28 C.F.R. Part\n542.  \nThe Supreme Court affirmed dismissal of the case for failure\nto complete exhaustion.  The High Court also closed the door on\nany futility arguments made by the inmate, stating, “we will not\nread futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion\nrequirements where Congress has provided otherwise.”  Id. at\n1825.  See also Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002).\nExhaustion of all stages of the administrative remedy system\nis therefore mandatory before a federal action may be commenced\nby a prisoner.  The Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") administrative\nremedy procedure is set out at 28 C.F.R. § 542.10, et seq., and\nprovides formal review of any complaint which relates to any\naspect of the inmate's confinement.  The process has four levels\nof review: informal resolution, institution level, regional\ndirector, and office of general counsel in central office, which\nis the final administrative appeal in the Bureau of Prisons.  28\nC.F.R. § 542.13-14.     \nA review of the administrative remedy requests filed by this\nplaintiff revealed that he exhausted his administrative remedies\nregarding the denial of wine on Fridays and Saturdays and holy\ndays under the former BOP Central Policy. See Attachment A:\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 6 of 52\nRequest for Administrative Remedies, and Regional and Central\nOffice Appeals.  However, the Plaintiff did not exhaust his\nadministrative remedies with respect to his request that a staff\nmember, other than the Jewish Rabbi, provide him with the wine he\nseeks.  See Attachment B: Declaration of Harrell Watts, National\nAppeals Administrator.  Thus, the court should dismiss those\nallegations.1  The Plaintiff is well acquainted with the\nadministrative remedy program as he has filed a total of 145\nadministrative requests since September of 2000.\nThe Bureau of Prisons Regulations and Program Statements\nThe Code of Federal Regulations explains that BOP does not\nrequire that incarcerated individuals express a religious belief\nor preference.  Upon arriving at the institution, inmates go\nthrough an initial screening completed by the Unit Team, during\nwhich inmates may or may not make known their religious\npreferences.  Inmates can also request a change of their\nreligious preferences by submitting a written request to the\nChaplain at any time. 28 C.F.R. § 548.10 (c).  BOP policy has\n1  Arguably, because Plaintiff exhausted his request for\nwine only under the BOP’s earlier policy, his claim under that\npolicy is ineffectual, because that former policy is moot.  BOP\nquestions whether his desire for relatively large amounts of wine\nwould ever be consistent with safety and security.  But if he is\nseeking to have his warden employ the “least restrictive\nalternative” of Program Statement 5360.09, he should address his\nrequest to his Warden.  The proper place to litigate such an\nissue, however, would be in the District where he is\nincarcerated.\n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 7 of 52\nprovided, and provides that in determining what religious\nactivities an inmate can participate in, “staff may wish to refer\nto information reported on the intake screening form and the\ninmate’s religious preference history.  Inmates showing ‘No\nPreference’ or indicating membership in a different faith group\nmay be restricted from participating in activities deemed\nappropriate for members only.”  See Program Statement 5360.08\n(Attachment C), ¶ 8; accord Program Statement 5360.09, ¶ 8.\nThe regulations, which afford all inmates equal\nopportunities in the accommodation of their religious practices,\nprovide:\n(a) The Bureau of Prisons provides inmates of all faith\ngroups with reasonable and equitable opportunities to pursue\nreligious beliefs and practices, within the constraints of\nbudgetary limitations and consistent with the security and\norderly running of the institution and the Bureau of\nPrisons.\n(b) When considered necessary for the security or good order\nof the institution, the Warden may limit attendance at or\ndiscontinue a religious activity.  Opportunities for\nreligious activities are open to the entire inmate\npopulation, without regard to race, color, nationality, or\nordinarily, creed. . . .\n28 C.F.R. § 548.10 (emphasis added).\nThe BOP policy specifically addresses the use of wine during\nreligious rituals.  The BOP policy, amended in August 2002, \nreads as follows:\nInmates may be permitted to receive small amounts of wine as\npart of a religious ritual, only when administered under the\nsupervision of clergy authorized by the Bureau of Prisons to\nperform the ritual. \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 8 of 52\nBecause wine is otherwise a contraband substance, it can be\ndispensed only under strict control and supervision. \nInmates will not be allowed to give wine to other inmates. \nFor purposes of this policy, the consumption of wine under\nthese circumstances will not be considered consumption of\nalcohol or ingestion of an illegal substance.  \nSee Program Statement 5360.08, Religious Beliefs and Practices,\npages 15-16, Section 20 (August 22, 2002 Change Notice).2 \nOn December 31, 2004, the BOP policy was again amended.  See\nAttachment C: Program Statement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and\nPractices, page 4, Section 7(b) (December 31, 2004). The 2004\namended policy which came into effect on December 31, 2004, reads\nas follows: \nInmates may be permitted to receive small amounts of\nwine as part of a religious ritual only when\nadministered under the supervision of BOP chaplains,\nclergy contractors, or clergy volunteers authorized by\nthe Bureau to perform the ritual.\nProgram Statement 5360.09 at 4.  The distinction between the two\namendments is that the 2004 amendment expands the category of\nindividuals who can administer the wine to “BOP chaplains, clergy\ncontractors, or clergy volunteers.” See id.\nIn determining how to accommodate the inmate requests for\nreligious practices, BOP regulations also provide: that \nThe Warden may request the chaplain to consult with\ncommunity representatives of the inmate’s faith group . . .\nto verify the religious significance of the requested\nobservance.  The chaplain will work with requesting inmates\nto accommodate a proper observance of the holy day.\n2  On August 22, 2002, a Change Notice amended the 2001\npolicy to allow inmates to use “small amounts of wine” during\nreligious rituals. See Program Statement 5360.08, Change Notice.\n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 9 of 52\n28 C.F.R. § 548.18.\nThe new BOP policy is rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental interest\nThe Court of Appeals in Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313\n(D.C. Cir. 2002), provided an analytical framework for cases\nfiled in the District of Columbia, which involve religious\npractices in correctional institutions.  In Levitan, Catholic\ninmates challenged the BOP policy no longer in effect which\nprohibited inmates from drinking wine at any time, even during\nreligious ceremonies.  Catholic inmates had previously been\nallowed to partake in the wine during mass and subsequently were\ndenied access to wine due to a policy change.3  Id. at 1316.  \nThe Levitan case involved a challenge under the First\nAmendment and did not address whether the BOP policy violated the\nRFRA as the appellants had not raised that issue at the District\nCourt level.  Id. at 1316.  Nevertheless, the Appellate Court\nremanded the case with instructions to apply Turner v. Safley,\n482 U.S. 78 (1987), and O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342\n(1987),4 as the standard applicable to cases involving a free\nexercise claim in this circuit.  Id. at 1318-19.  The Levitan\n3  The 1997 policy stated that “[s]acramental wine is\nnecessary for the worship of some faith groups . . .  In those\ncases only, the staff or contract chaplain may consume small\namounts of wine for performance of the ritual.”  See Program\nStatement 5360.07, Religious Beliefs and Practices, at 10,\nSection 19 (August 25, 1997).\n4  In O’Lone, the Supreme Court applied the reasonableness\ntest in Turner.  See infra.  \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 10 of 52\ncourt concluded that the religious practice subject to\nrestriction does not have to be mandatory to be protected.  Id.\nat 1319.  However, the restriction must be of a substantial\nnature, and the restriction may be substantial if the practice is\nbased on a sincere belief.  Id. at 1319-20.  \nThe Plaintiff in this case files his complaint under RFRA. \nThe Bureau of Prisons has amended its policy since Levitan and\ncurrently allows inmates the use of wine during religious\nrituals. The current policy is reasonable and establishes a\nbalance between the religious rights of inmates and the\nlegitimate governmental interest of maintaining security of the\ninstitution.   \nIn Levitan, the Catholic inmates’ religious practice could\nhave been accommodated with a small amount of wine, or even by\njust dipping the host in the wine. Id. at 183.  Unlike the small\namount of wine at issue in Levitan, the Plaintiff in this case is\nasking for a relatively large quantity of wine on a regular basis\nthereby presenting the institution with a serious threat to\nsecurity and a significant challenge to the efficient allocation\nof resources devoted to religious purposes as similar requests\nfor wine from inmates of all religions who utilize wine would\nhave to be accommodated.  See Declaration of Susan VanBaalen\n(\"VanBaalen Decl.\"); Declaration of Linda Thomas (\"Thomas\nDecl.\").  The BOP policy the Plaintiff challenges meets the test\n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 11 of 52\nenunciated in Turner as it is reasonably related to the\nlegitimate governmental interest of maintaining the secure and\norderly running of correctional institutions.  Moreover, the\nlimitations imposed by Plaintiff’s Warden and by BOP’s Central\nPolicy are the least restrictive alternatives that allow some\nwine for religious purposes but are designed to protect the\nsafety and security of the prisons.\nThe New BOP Regulation and Policy Statement \nsatisfy the Turner test as enunciated in Levitan and the RFRA\nThe Levitan Court directed district courts to apply the\nTurner test in cases involving regulations which restrict the\nfree exercise of religion in a prison setting.  In so doing, the\ncourt outlined the four prong test first enunciated in Turner,\nsupra, as follows:\nFirst, there must be a valid, rational connection between\nthe regulation and the legitimate interest put forth to\njustify it.  Second, there must be a determination whether\nthe prisoners retain alternative means of exercising their\nasserted rights.  Third, there must be an assessment of the\nimpact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right\nwill have on guards, other inmates, and prison resources. \nFinally, “the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of\nthe reasonableness of a prison regulation.”\nId. at 1318 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 90).  In Turner, the\nSupreme Court recognized the difficulty in running prisons which\n“requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources,\nall of which are peculiarly within the province of the\nlegislative and executive branches of government.”  Turner,\n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 12 of 52\nsupra, at 85.  The Supreme Court established the standard of\nreview “that is responsive both to the ‘policy of judicial\nrestraint regarding prisoner complaints and [to] the need to\nprotect constitutional rights.’”  Id.  Application of the Turner\ntest to the BOP religious policy reflects that it is rationally\nrelated to the security of the prisons.\nFirst, the BOP regulations and policy (hereinafter BOP\npolicy) regarding the use of wine by incarcerated individuals for\na religious purpose meet the first prong of the Turner test.  The\npolicy is permissive; thus, allowing prison administrators to\nmake decisions which fit the special circumstances or inmate\npopulation in their institutions.  The governmental interest in\nrestricting the use of wine in federal correctional institutions\nis most definitely legitimate.  Use of wine or any other\nalcoholic beverage in prison could seriously compromise the\nsecurity of the institution as such consumption has the effect of\naltering moods and eliciting violent behavior.  See Linda Thomas,\n¶ 4-11.  Many individuals who consume alcohol engage in violent,\nerratic behavior, or behavior that disrupts the orderly running\nof the institution.  See VanBaalen Decl., ¶¶ 11-16; Thomas Decl.,\n¶¶ 4-11.  This violent and erratic behavior may be exacerbated by\nthe conditions of confinement.  Id.  Many incarcerated offenders\nhave a history of substance abuse and may utilize the religious\nrituals to get the amounts of alcohol or wine they choose.  See\n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 13 of 52\nThomas Decl., ¶¶ 5-11.  The governmental objective in this case\nis neutral and the regulation is implemented in a neutral\nfashion.  All inmates of all religious faiths are treated the\nsame, are subject to the same policy, and are provided the same\nor equivalent access to religious objects and rituals.  \nThe BOP policy is not arbitrary or irrational nor is it an\nexaggerated response to a governmental interest.  The BOP policy\nallows for the use of wine in “small amounts” during religious\nrituals thereby striking a compromise between the religious\nrights of the inmates and the secure and orderly running of the\ninstitution.  See Program Statement 5360.09, ¶ 7; VanBaalen\nDecl., ¶¶ 6-7, 12-16; Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.  \nIn FCI Beaumont’s Low Security facility (“Beaumont Low”),\ninmates are not allowed to partake in the wine because of\nsecurity concerns.  Even if Beaumont Low allowed wine, the\nPlaintiff would not obtain the relief he is seeking.  The\nPlaintiff in this case is asking for a substantial amount of wine\n- several ounces on a regular basis - clearly outside the amount\ngenerally allowed by the BOP policy.  Specifically, he is asking\nfor 3.5 ounces while saying Kiddush5 during Friday and Saturday\n5 “The Sabbath meal on Friday evening is ushered in with the\nrecital of Kiddush (the sanctification blessing).  It is\nmeritorious to say Kiddush over aged and perfect wine, but grape\njuice is acceptable in the institutional setting. . . . When wine\nof grape juice are unavailable, the Kiddush may be recited over\ntwo loaves of bread or whole matzot. . . . The Kiddush should\nalso be recited over a cup of wine or grape juice at the start of\nthe Sabbath morning meal.” Institutional Handbook of Jewish\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 14 of 52\nshabbos6 services, and four cups of 3.5 ounces of wine each\nduring the Passover seder.7  The BOP must provide equal\nopportunities for all inmates of all faith groups to pursue their\nreligious practices.  As a result, BOP would have to provide all\ninmates with religious practices involving wine consumption with\nsubstantial amounts of wine.  See VanBaalen Decl., ¶¶ 7-8. \nIndeed, BOP would have to accommodate inmates’ requests for wine\nin the amounts requested.  Thus, the dispensation of wine as the\nPlaintiff requests would be contrary to sound correctional\nPractice and Procedure, Chapter 4-7 (9/98).  \n6 Shabbos and Shabbat both are the Hebrew word for Sabbath.  \n7 Passover Seder is described as follows:  \nThe two Passover Seders are not simply ‘meals’ - they are\nreligious rituals that require certain foods as part of\ntheir proper observance.  Observant Jews are obligated to\npartake in two Seders on Passover, on the first two eves of\nthe holiday.\nDuring the Seder, the ‘Haggadah’ is recited.  The Haggadah\nis a collection of prayers, songs and text recounting the\nExodus from Egypt.\nMatzo, bitter herbs and wine (or grape juice), ‘Charoses’\n(see below), a chicken neck or other piece of roasted meat,\nhorseradish and romaine lettuce, potatoes, onions, salt\nwater and a hard-boiled whole egg are religious items that\nare required to complete the Seder rituals, as are the other\nfoods comprising a religious meal.\nAmong other rituals, Jews are mandated to drink four cups of\nwine at each of the two Seders. . . .  If, however, for\nhealth or other reasons, wine is unavailable, kosher grape\njuice may be used instead.\nId. at 6-20.  \n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 15 of 52\njudgment and would seriously jeopardize the security of BOP\ninstitutions.  See Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.\nMoreover, Beaumont Low is utilizing grape juice as a\nsubstitute for wine for the celebration of religious rituals,\nincluding those of Judaism.  See VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 4.  Grape\njuice is accepted in the Jewish faith generally as a permissible\nsubstitute for wine during the Jewish ceremonies and holy days. \nSee VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 13.  The Plaintiff is still able to\ncelebrate his religious holy days and observances.  He is given\naccess to a Rabbi and to articles needed to celebrate his holy\ndays.  Id., ¶ 5.  Thus, the policy is a rational response to the\nlegitimate governmental interest of preserving institution\nsecurity. \nSecond, the plaintiff has an alternative means to exercise\nhis religious preference.  In engaging in this prong of the\nTurner analysis, the Court looked at whether the inmates were\ndeprived of “all means of expression.”  Turner, supra, at 92.  In\nO’Lone, the Supreme Court upheld a prison policy which prevented\nsome Muslim prisoners from participating in a Muslim service as\nthe Plaintiffs were not deprived of “all forms of religious\nexercise but instead allow[ed] participation in a number of\nMuslim religious ceremonies.”  O’Lone, supra, at 343.  Similar to\nO’Lone, this Court should look at the plaintiff’s ability to\nparticipate in all the holy days and observances of his religion\n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 16 of 52\nas support that the restriction on the use of wine is reasonable. \nThe Plaintiff is allowed to participate in all weekly Sabbath\nobservances, which consist of two congregate services one on\nFriday evening and the other on Saturday morning.  The\ninstitution contracts a Rabbi who visits the institution once a\nmonth.  VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 5.  The Plaintiff is allowed to\nobserve the required Occasional Observances/Holy Days & Public\nFasts as they occur throughout the Jewish Calendar Year.  He also\nreceives a Kosher diet.  Id.  Moreover, as the Plaintiff himself\nadmits in his complaint, the institution Chaplain provides him\nwith “grape juice, candles, matzah,8 a lighter, and other\nreligious acoutrements [sic]. . .” Complaint, ¶ 20.  Thus, the\napplication of the policy to the Plaintiff’s request only bars\nhim from drinking the substantial amount of wine he seeks during\nthe rituals, but it does not bar him from participating or\nobserving the holy days and rituals of his religion as reflected\nin the same Code of Jewish Law which he cites.  Complaint, ¶ 9;   \nThus, the application of the regulation does not deprive the\nplaintiff “of all means of expression.”  \nThe Plaintiff in this case challenges the decision to\n8 The matzah is known as the bread of affliction the Jews\neat during Passover.  “Matzah has no special flavor, as it\ncontains no salt and no yeast.  The dough for baking the matzah\nmust not be allowed to become leavened.  For this reason, while\nkneading the dough, special precautions are taking against\nfermentation.”  Rabbi Solomon Ganzfried, Code of Jewish Law, fn.\n81, Hebrew Publishing Co. (1961). \n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 17 of 52\nutilize grape juice for his religious observances.  Based on\nsecurity concerns, wine is not used at Beaumont Low.  The Rabbi\nhas indicated that grape juice is an adequate substitute for\nwine.  The Levitan court concluded that a statement made by a\nreligious leader about the consumption of wine not being\nmandatory in not necessary dispositive of the issue.  In this\ncase, Jewish Law itself, upon which the Rabbi relies and which\nPlaintiff contends he follows (Complaint, ¶ 9), provides grape\njuice as an alternative to celebrate the Kuddish and Passover\nSeder when wine is not available.  See Institutional Handbook, at\n4-7 and 6-20; VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 4.  Indeed, the recitation of\nKuddish can be done in one of three ways:  pray Kuddish over\nwine, pray Kuddish over grape juice, or pray Kuddish over the\nbread without wine.  Id.  Consistent with this instruction, grape\njuice is being used as a substitute for wine at Beaumont Low.\nPlaintiff still retains alternative means of expressing his\nreligious belief and is able to participate in all observances of\nhis religion. \nThird, accommodating the plaintiff’s request would have a\nserious, negative impact on the security of inmates, correctional\nofficers, and even religious services staff.  See VanBaalen\nDecl., ¶¶ 6-8, 11-13, 16-18; Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.  In\nenunciating this prong, the Turner court explained:\nIn the necessarily closed environment of the correctional\ninstitution, few changes will have no ramifications on the\n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 18 of 52\nliberty of others or on the use of the prison’s limited\nresources for preserving institutional order.  When\naccommodation of an asserted right will have a significant\n“ripple effect” on fellow inmates or on prison staff, courts\nshould be particularly deferential to the informed decision\nof corrections officials.\nTurner, supra, at 90.  \nTo give Plaintiff the relief he seeks would impose a\ntremendous burden on institution resources as wine would have to\nbe provided to all inmates of all religious faiths who utilize\nwine in the amounts of the inmates’ preferences. See United\nStates v. Jefferson, 175 F.Supp.2d 1123, 1132 (N.D. Ill.\n2001)(“Any judicial attempt to carve out a religious exception\nwill result in significant administrative problems for the\n[agency] and open the door to a myriad of claims for religious\nexceptions.”) One of the main principles of correctional\nmanagement is to provide all inmates with equal opportunities and\nnot to afford preferential treatment to any particular group or\ninmate.  The principle of equity was preserved in the policy at\nissue here.  The resources available in the institutions are\nlimited.  Moreover, the BOP would lose its ability to restrict\ndrinking wine in its institutions, in the amounts, time, place,\nand manner that would not compromise the security of the\ninstitution whenever an inmate asserts a religious purpose. \nAdditionally, to provide the inmate with wine would mean to force\nthe Rabbi to give him wine against his own decision or to even\nviolate the Rabbi’s own religious practice. \n- 16 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 19 of 52\nFourth, there are no ready alternatives to accommodate the\nPlaintiff’s request.  The BOP amended its policy to accommodate\nthe religious rights of inmates and provided that inmates may use\n“small amounts of wine” during religious rituals.  There is no\nother alternative to accommodate the competing interests of\nsecurity of the institution and the religious practices of\nincarcerated individuals.  The discretionary nature of the policy\nstrikes a balance between those two competing interests.  The\npolicy is clearly not an exaggerated response to prison concerns. \nGenerally, if a plaintiff can “point to an alternative that\nfully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to\nvalid penological interests, a court may consider that as\nevidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable\nrelationship standard.”  Id. at 91.  The Plaintiff has not been\nable to point to an alternative that properly safeguards safety\nand security; he is requesting 3.5 ounces of wine for Kiddush and\nthe shabbos services on Friday nights and Saturday morning and\nfour glasses of 3.5. ounces of wine for Passover Seder.   The\nPlaintiff contends that BOP could use Manischewitz, which\naccording to him distills a low alcohol wine.  However, the\nPlaintiff requests such large amounts of wine on a regular basis\nthat providing him even with this presumptively low alcohol wine\nwould impose a heavy burden on prison resources and still not\nadequately protect against drunkenness and assaultive behavior by\n- 17 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 20 of 52\nthose attempting to secure more wine of any alcoholic content. \nSee VanBaalen Decl., ¶¶ 12, 16; Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.  The same\naccommodations would have to be made for all inmates whose\nclaimed religious practices might include the use of wine. \nSpecifically, inmates would be able to obtain the amount of wine\nof their choice so long as they raise a sincere religious belief\nthat requires the wine, a situation which would pose a serious\nthreat to the security of prisons.  Id.\nIn light of all these reasons, the new policy is rationally\nrelated to the governmental interest in maintaining the security\nof the institutions and meets the four prong test in Turner. \nSimilarly, Plaintiff does not have a valid claim under the\nReligious Freedom and Restoration Act.  In his complaint,\nPlaintiff contends that the denial of his request for wine\nsubstantially burdens his free exercise of religion as it is\nbased on his sincere religious belief.  Plaintiff contends that\nin denying his request, the BOP “did not assert a compelling\ngovernmental interest nor did [it] consider if [this] outright\ndenial was the least restrictive means. . .” Plaintiff’s\ncomplaint, ¶ 18.  Plaintiff further contends that the BOP failed\nto accommodate his request for religious accommodation in\nviolation of RFRA. \nOn November 16, 1993, Congress enacted RFRA, which reads as\nfollows:\n- 18 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 21 of 52\n(a) In general\nGovernment shall not substantially burden a person's\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule\nof general applicability, except as provided in subsection\n(b) of this section.\n(b) Exception\nGovernment may substantially burden a person's exercise of\nreligion only if it demonstrates that application of the\nburden to the person--\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling governmental interest.\n(c) Judicial relief\nA person whose religious exercise has been burdened in\nviolation of this section may assert that violation as a\nclaim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain\nappropriate relief against a government.  Standing to assert\na claim or defense under this section shall be governed by\nthe general rules of standing under article III of the\nConstitution.\nReligious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C.A. §\n2000bb.  The RFRA was Congress’ way of returning to the\ncompelling governmental interest abrogated in Employment\nDivision, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\nU.S. 872 (1990).  The RFRA statute does not provide definitions\nof its key terms “substantial burden,” “compelling governmental\ninterest,” and/or “least restrictive means.”  See id.  The\nLegislative Committee encouraged Courts to look at cases prior to\nthe Smith case for guidance with respect to those definitions.\nSee S. Rep. 103-111.  Inmates are allowed to bring claims under\nRFRA.  The legislative history of RFRA shows that Congress\n- 19 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 22 of 52\nintended through the enactment of this statute for courts to\naccord prison administrators due deference.9  \nUnder RFRA, the government cannot substantially burden a\nperson’s exercise of religion.  “Inadequately formulated prison\nregulations and policies grounded on mere speculation,\nexaggerated fears, or post-hac rationalizations will not suffice\nto meet the [A]ct’s requirements.”  S. Rep. No. 103-111.  In\norder to state a claim under RFRA, plaintiff must allege facts\ndemonstrating that a sincerely held religious belief has been\nsubstantially burdened by the government policies.  Henderson v.\nKennedy, 253 F.3d 12 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  Jackson v. District of\nColumbia, 89 F. Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2000).  Once the Plaintiff has\nmet the burden of showing a substantial burden on his sincerely\nheld beliefs, the burden then shifts to the government to\ndemonstrate that application of a burden to the person’s religion\nis (1) in furtherance of a compelling government interest and (2)\n9 In so doing, the Committee explained:\nThe Committee does not intend to act to impose a\nstandard that would exacerbate the difficult and\ncomplex challenges of operating the Nation’s prisons\nand jails in a safe and secure manner.  Accordingly,\nthe committee expects that the courts will continue the\ntradition of giving due deference to the experience and\nexpertise to prison and jail administrators in\nestablishing necessary regulations and procedures to\nmaintain good order, security and discipline,\nconsistent with consideration of costs and limited\nresources.\nS.

He asserts he\n“frequently attends Jewish services, events, etc. . . .” \nComplaint, ¶ 8.   The Plaintiff contends that he must drink wine\nduring the Sabbath and Passover Seder as drinking wine is not\nonly central to his religion but it is also a sincerely held\nbelief.   In his complaint, Plaintiff specifically contends that\nhe sincerely believes: \nthat he must drink at least 3.5 ounces of red wine (a\nreviit) while saying Kiddush, a prayer sanctifying the\nSabbath, during Friday night and Saturday shabbos services. \nPlaintiff sincerely believes that wine must be used because\nit has been dictated by Jewish sages, the Code of Jewish\nLaw, and by practice.  For example, before his\nincarceration, plaintiff said Kiddush over wine during his\nFriday night and Saturday morning shabbos services.\nPlaintiff also sincerely believes that he must drink four\ncups containing at least 3.5 ounces of wine during the\nPassover sader . . .\nComplaint, ¶¶ 9-10.\nIn Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215-16 (1972), a case\npreceding Smith, supra, and the passage of RFRA, the Supreme\nCourt cautioned that “[a]lthough a determination of what is a\n‘religious’ belief or practice entitled to constitutional\nprotection may present a most delicate question, the very concept\n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 24 of 52\nof ordered liberty precludes allowing every person to make his\nown standards on matters of conduct in which society as a whole\nhas important interests.”  The Supreme Court later said that\n“[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality\nof particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of\nparticular litigants’ interpretation of those creeds.”  Hernandez\nv.

But, assuming arguendo that Plaintiff holds a sincere\nreligious belief to drink the amounts of wine he identifies in\nhis Complaint, the BOP policy does not impose a substantial\nburden on his sincere belief, is justified by a compelling\ngovernmental interest, and constitutes the least restrictive\nmeans of achieving that interest.\nThe BOP Regulation does not impose a substantial burden\non the Plaintiff’s Sincerely Held Beliefs\nAssuming that the Plaintiff has the sincerely held belief of\nhaving wine in the amounts and manner he describes in the\nComplaint, he now bears the burden of showing that the BOP\nregulation substantially burdens his sincere religious belief. \nMere conclusory allegations are not enough to carry that burden.\n\"[A] court must accept only well-pleaded allegations of fact, it\n- 22 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 25 of 52\nneed not 'accept ‘legal conclusions.’” Taiwo Okusami v.\nPsychiatric Inst. of Washington, Inc., 959 F.2d 1062, 1069 (D.C.\nCir. 1992), quoting 5A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure, § 1357, at 315; see also Kowal v. MCI Communications\nCorp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

Circuit Court found the challenged regulation which banned\nthe sales of T-shirts in the Mall was content neutral and did not\ndiscriminate among viewpoints.  Id. at 16.  The plaintiffs still\nhad a “multitude of means” to spread the gospel as they could\nstill distribute the T-shirts for free or sell them elsewhere. \nId.  Essentially, the Court found the regulation did not force\nplaintiffs “to engage in conduct that their religion forbids or\nthat it prevents them from engaging in conduct their religion\nrequires. . . . Nor does the regulation ‘significantly inhibit or\nconstrain conduct or expression that manifests some central tenet\nof [plaintiffs] beliefs.’” Id. at 17.  See also Lynn v.

The plaintiffs were not\nforced to change their practices nor were they force to violate a\ntenet of their religion.  Thus, the Court upheld the regulation\nsince it did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs. \nSee also Thiry v.

Ascroft, 191\nF.Supp.2d 23, 25 (D.D.C. 2002), the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia, on remand, evaluated a case in which the\nVirginia Department of Corrections (\"VDOC\") grooming policy\nprecluded BOP inmates housed in VDOC, from complying with the\nfundamental tenet of their religions (i.e., Rastafarian and\nMuslim) which prohibited men from shaving their faces.  BOP\ninmates in VDOC institutions sued on the basis of RFRA.  In order\nto ensure compliance with this grooming regulation, VDOC went as\nfar as forcibly shaving inmates and placing them in segregation\nfor failure to voluntarily comply with the grooming regulation. \nId. at 26. The Court found a substantial burden on the inmates’\nreligious beliefs as they were forced to violate a fundamental\ntenet of their religion. Id. at 26-27.\nIn Cockrell-El v. District of Columbia, the Plaintiff\ncontended that his rights under RFRA were violated as he was not\nable to travel to and from his religious service without being\nassaulted.  937 F.Supp. at 21.  The Court found no substantial\nburden as the Plaintiff contended the alleged assault occurred\nafter the Plaintiff attended the service and neither prevented\nthe Plaintiff from participating in his religious practice nor\npressured him to commit an action that would violate his\nreligion.  Id.  The plaintiff failed to show that “the state\n- 25 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 28 of 52\ncondition[ed] receipt of an important benefit upon conduct\nproscribed by a religious faith, or [that] it denie[d] such a\nbenefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby\nputting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his\nbehavior and to violate his beliefs.” Id. (Citation omitted). \nSee Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963)(finding that\nconditioning “the availability of benefits upon the appellant’s\nwillingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious\nfaith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her\nconstitutional liberties.”) \nIn this case, especially given the Code of Jewish Law upon\nwhich Plaintiff, himself, relies, Plaintiff’s allegations do not\nrise to the level of a substantial burden - only an inconvenience\nsuffered which does not significantly inhibit or constrain his\nreligious conduct or expression.10  Nothing in the complaint\nindicates any fundamental or substantial interference with the\nexercise of his religious rights.  In accordance with RFRA, the\nBOP attempts to accommodate the practices of religion of all\ninmates of all religions at correctional institutions.  However,\nan inconvenience to an inmate’s practice of religion is not\n10  Defendants are mindful that the Court of Appeals has\nconcluded that the protections of free exercise clause of the\nConstitution are not limited to religions that incorporate\nmandatory tenets, see Levitan, 281 F.3d at 1320.  But, the Court\nhas also reiterated that \"it is sometimes the case that litigants\ncan make no credible showing that the affected practice is either\ncentral or important in their religious scheme.\"  Id. at 1321.  \n- 26 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 29 of 52\nconsidered a substantial interference. \nThe policy in question and its application to the Plaintiff\ndoes not have the effect of changing or inhibiting his religious\nexpression.  It does not have the effect of precluding the\nPlaintiff from complying with a tenet of his religion nor does it\nforce him to engage in activities that violate his religion.  The\nBOP does not condition the receipt of any benefit upon the\nPlaintiff’s willingness to not drink wine during his religious\nholy days.  See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963).  \nThe Plaintiff can practice all observances of his religion. \nIndeed, the Plaintiff can pray Kiddush and participate in\nPassover Seder without wine in accordance with the Jewish Law\nupon which he describes himself as observing.   The BOP provides\nthe Plaintiff with articles, such as candles and matzah, he may\nuse to celebrate his religious holy days.  The BOP also provides\nthe Plaintiff with an adequate substitute for wine by providing\nhim with Kosher grape juice.  The BOP contracts with a Rabbi to\nvisit the institution periodically.  VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 5. \nAlthough Plaintiff asserts that he disagrees with the Rabbi\nregarding the use of wine, “[t]he Constitution does not require .\n. . a religious advisor whose beliefs are completely congruent\nwith his own.”  Weir v. Nix, 114 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir. 1997). \nThe application of the BOP policy to this Plaintiff is “at most a\nrestriction on one of a multitude of means, it is not a\n- 27 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 30 of 52\nsubstantial burden on [his] vocation.”  See Lynn, supra, 485 U.S.\nat 450-51.  But see Rigdon v. Perry, 962 F.Supp. 150, 162 (D.D.C.\n1997) (court found a substantial burden when military chaplains\nwere prohibited from encouraging congregants to write to Congress\nabout pending abortion law as the chaplains were left with no\nautonomy to determine the religious content of their sermons).\nNevertheless, assuming arguendo that the BOP policy imposes\na substantial burden on the Plaintiff’s religious practices, such\nburden is justified by a compelling governmental interest and it\nconstitutes the least restrictive means. \nThe burden on Plaintiff’s Religion is in furtherance of a\ncompelling governmental interest\nThe Plaintiff contends that BOP is substantially burdening\nhis sincere belief to drink wine and such burden is not in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest in violation of\nRFRA.\nRFRA was passed to return to the compelling governmental\ninterest standard enunciated in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398\n(1963).  See H.R. Rep. 103-88 (May 11, 1993).  Under the RFRA,\nthe government bears the burden of showing that the policy\nfurthers a compelling government interest.  To be compelling, the\n“interest must be of the ‘highest order.’” Winconsin v. Yoder,\nsupra, 406 U.S. at 215.  Maintaining security in correctional\ninstitutions has been regarded as an interest of the “highest\n- 28 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 31 of 52\norder.”  H.R. Rep. 103-88, supra.  “Whether something qualifies\nas a compelling interest is a question of law.”  United States v.\nHardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1127 (10th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).\nUnder the RFRA, a court will not examine the general\napplication of a prison regulation, but will instead look at\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest, advanced\nthrough the least restrictive means, to apply the prison\nregulation to the individual Plaintiff.  Kikumura v. Hurley, 242\nF.3d 950 (10th Cir. 2001).  The government has a compelling\ninterest in controlling alcohol consumption and intoxicants\nwithin its prison walls.  See Jenkins v. Angelone, 948 F.Supp.\n543, 548 (E.D. Va. 1996)(denying inmate a religious diet which\nconsisted of fresh fruit and vegetables because the “potential\nfor inmates to make alcohol or mash would dramatically increase”\nwhich would “result in a great security threat” to the\ninstitution.)  The use of alcohol has a correlation with violent\nand disruptive behaviors.  See VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 14; Thomas\nDecl., ¶¶ 4-11.  This correlation is exacerbated in the volatile\nprison environment where tensions are already at its highest. \nBecause of the threat posed by alcohol consumption in prisons,\nBOP policy generally prohibits inmates from drinking alcohol. \nIndeed, the BOP disciplinary code penalizes inmates who use\nalcohol or intoxicants in prison.  28 C.F.R. § 541.13 (Codes 215,\n222).  The BOP policy, however, strikes a balance between the\n- 29 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 32 of 52\nreligious rights of inmates and the security of the institution\nby providing in its religious policy that inmates may be allowed\nto drink a “small amount of wine” during religious rituals.  \nPlaintiff is requesting to have 3.5 ounces of wine for\nshabbos services on Friday evening and Saturday morning and four\nglasses of 3.5 ounces of wine in Passover Seder.  The Plaintiff’s\nrequest can reasonably be read as outside the scope of the BOP\npolicy, which allows inmates to drink “small amounts of wine”\nduring religious rituals.  The Plaintiff seeks to amend policy as\nopposed to comport with it.  By asking for such large amounts of\nwine, the Plaintiff is seeking to obtain preferential treatment\nover other Jewish inmates as well as all other inmates at\nBeaumont Low.  To allow this one Jewish inmate to get wine in the\nmanner he seeks would create serious problems in the institution. \nPrison officials would appear to favor one inmate over all other\ninmates of his own and other religious affiliations.  This could\nreadily lead to violence in the institution.\nMoreover, to give Plaintiff the relief he seeks would create\nan administrative nightmare for prison administrators at Beaumont\nLow and eventually the entire BOP.  BOP religious policy is\ngrounded on the principle of equal opportunities for all inmates\nof all religious affiliations within the constraints necessary to\neffectively allocate resources and maintain the secure and\norderly running of BOP institutions.  Under the Plaintiff’s\n- 30 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 33 of 52\ndesired construction of the BOP policy, BOP would have to provide\ninmates with a sincere belief to drink wine in the amounts they\nchoose.  A situation which could lead to chaos in prisons.  This\nwould no doubt create a serious security problem in BOP\ninstitutions.  See, e.g., VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 14; Thomas Decl., ¶¶\n4-11.\nIn light of these reasons, the Court should defer to BOP’s\ndecision to deny Plaintiff’s request as there exists a compelling\ngovernment interest in maintaining security in prisons.\nThe burden on Plaintiff’s Religion constitutes the least\nrestrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental\ninterest\nPlaintiff contends that the BOP policy does not constitute\nthe least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental\ninterest.\n“The government cannot meet its burden to prove least\nrestrictive means unless it has actually considered and rejected\nthe efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the\nchallenged practice.”  Gartrell, supra, 191 F.Supp.2d at 39-40. \nThis, however, does not mean that prison officials must analyze\nevery conceivable option in order to satisfy this prong of RFRA.\nSee Hamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1556 (8th Cir. 1996),\ncert. denied, 519 U.S. 874 (1996):\nIt would be a herculean burden to require prison\nadministrators to refute every conceivable option in\norder to satisfy the least restrictive means prong of\n- 31 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 34 of 52\nRFRA.  Moreover, such an onerous requirement would be\nirreconcilable with the well-established principle,\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and RFRA’s legislative\nhistory, that prison administrators must be accorded\ndue deference in creating regulations and policies\ndirected at the maintenance of prison safety and\nsecurity.\nHamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d at 1556.  The government can meet\nits burden to prove the least restrictive means by showing the\nless restrictive alternatives were not acceptable to the\nplaintiff.  See id. (ruling in favor of prison officials who\ndenied Plaintiff’s request for a sweat lodge as Plaintiff’s “own\nall-or-nothing position supports the prison officials’ contention\nthat an outright prohibition against a sweat lodge ceremony is\nthe least restrictive means . . .”).  \nJustice Blackmun warned that “[a] judge would be\nunimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a\nlittle less ‘drastic’ or a little less ‘restrictive’ in almost\nany situation.”  Hamilton, supra (quoting Illinois State Board of\nElections v. Socialist Worker Party, 440 U.S. 173, 188-89\n(1979)(Blackmun, concurring)).  See also S. Rep. 103-111, supra,\nat 1909.  Thus, Courts must exercise judicial restraint and defer\nto the prison administrators decisions with respect to the\nimplementation of policies and procedures in prisons.  It is\nextremely difficult for prison administrators to evaluate and\naccommodate individual requests for special treatment under RFRA\nwhile maintaining the integrity of their policy.  “The most\n- 32 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 35 of 52\neffective and fair means of applying prison regulations is across\nthe board to avoid resentment . . .” among inmates.  Blanken v.\nOhio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, 944 F.Supp.\n1359, 1368 (S.D. Ohio 1996).  \nIn Gartrell v. Ashcroft, supra, 191 F.Supp.2d at 28, the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia found that BOP could\nnot establish that placing inmates with religious objections to\ngrooming in VDOC facilities with a mandatory grooming regulation\nwas the least restrictive alternative to achieve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.   The Court analyzed some alternative\nmeans to accommodate the religious beliefs of the inmates and the\nresources available to the BOP in identifying institutions with\nno mandatory grooming practices.  Id. at 27-36.  There, the Court\nopined, BOP had the screening procedures to identify inmates with\nreligious objections to the grooming policy and could easily\nhouse them in institutions that did not have a mandatory grooming\npolicy.  Moreover, BOP conceded then that it had not considered\nany less restrictive alternative.  Thus, the Court concluded that\nhousing inmates with religious objections in VDOC institutions\nwas not the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling\ngovernmental interest.\nThe present BOP religious policy constitutes the least\nrestrictive means for achieving a compelling governmental\ninterest.  The BOP 1997 religious policy, which is the policy\n- 33 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 36 of 52\nchallenged in Levitan, did not allow inmates to consume wine\nduring religious rituals or at any other time for religious\npurposes.  Indeed, the 1997 policy only allowed the celebrant of\nthe ritual to drink wine. \nBy 2002, the BOP had amended its religious policy to provide\nthat “[i]nmates may be permitted to receive small amounts of wine\nas part of a religious ritual.”  See Program Statement 5260.08,\nReligious Beliefs and Practices, pages 15-16, Section 20 (August\n22, 2002 Change Notice).  This policy is permissive and allows\nprison administrators discretion to make determinations regarding\nthe use of wine by inmates for religious purposes.  \nThe policy as it applies to the Plaintiff is the least\nrestrictive means of achieving a governmental interest.  The use\nof wine at Beaumont Low was found to present a security problem\nat the institution, and as a result, inmates are not allowed to\nuse it.  The application of the policy to the Plaintiff has not\nprecluded him from participating in the rituals of his religion.  \nThe Plaintiff requests 3.5 ounces of wine for shabbos\nservices on Friday and Saturday and four glasses of 3.5 ounces of\nwine for Passover Seder.  This is clearly a large amount of wine\nfor the institution setting.  The least restrictive means in\nPlaintiff’s case is to allow him to continue participating in the\nrituals with grape juice.  There are no other least restrictive\nmeans in this case.  The Plaintiff’s insistence on getting wine\n- 34 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 37 of 52\nin the amounts specified by him shows that he has concluded that\nno other option is acceptable.  Thus, the government has met its\nburden to show that its inability to satisfy his request\nconsistent with the safety and security of the institution and\nthe current BOP policy constitute the least restrictive means in\nthis case.\nRequiring Plaintiff to celebrate his rituals without\nrelatively large amounts of wine, but with kosher grape juice\nconstitutes the least restrictive means of furthering the\ncompelling governmental interest in preserving the security in\nour institutions.  See May v. Baldwin, 109 F.3d 557, 563 (9th\nCir. 1997) (requiring Rastafarian inmates to unbraid dreadlocks\nwhen being transferred was found to be the least restrictive\nmeans as the use of a metal detector or having staff conduct\nsearches by touching the hair were not effective enough);\nVanBaalen Decl., ¶ 11.\nThe Plaintiff is not entitled to Prospective Relief\nThe statute governing prospective and injunctive relief in\nthe PLRA, codified at 18 U.S.C § 3626(a)(1) and (2), puts\nsubstantial limits on injunctive and other \"prospective relief.\" \n“Prospective relief\" is defined in the statute as \"all relief\nother than compensatory monetary damages.\" 18 U.S.C. 3626(g)(7). \nSpecifically, the Act provides, \"relief in any civil action with\nrespect to ‘prison conditions’ (defined by the Supreme Court in\n- 35 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 38 of 52\nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 525 (2002), as \"any aspect of\nprison life\") shall extend no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or\nplaintiffs.  The court shall not grant or approve any prospective\nrelief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn,\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the\nFederal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to\ncorrect the violation of the Federal right.\"  18 U.S.C.\n3626(a)(1) and (2). \nIn this case, clearly, the Plaintiff is not entitled to\ninjunctive relief and a declaratory judgment.  The Court must\nmake particularized findings of the Federal right violated and\nthe needs-narrowness-intrusiveness requirements under the act. \nId.  This mandatory requirement must be more than mimicking the\nlanguage of the statute, as discussed in Cason v. Seckinger, 231\nF.3d 777 (11th Cir. 2000); see also, Johnson v. Breeden, 280 F.3d\n1308 (11th Cir. 2002).  And the statute further states, \"[t]he\ncourt shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on\npublic safety or the operation of a criminal justice system\ncaused by the relief.\"\nSimilarly, Plaintiff is not entitled to declaratory relief. \nPlaintiff is seeking declaratory relief.  The statute governing\ndeclaratory relief is found in 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (a) and provides:\n... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an\nappropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal\n- 36 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 39 of 52\nrelations of any interested party seeking such declaration,\nwhether or not further relief is or could be sought.  Any\nsuch declaration shall have the force and effect of a final\njudgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.\nIn determining the appropriateness of a declaratory\njudgment, the Court will look at (1) whether declaratory judgment\nwill definitely settle the controversy; (2) the availability of\nother remedies or other proceedings that may be pending; (3) the\nconvenience of the parties; (4) the equity of the conduct of the\ndeclaratory judgment; (5) the prevention of 'procedural fencing';\n(6) the state of the court record; (7) the degree of the conflict\nbetween the parties and (8) the public importance of the question\nto be decided.  Rooney v. Secretary of Army, 293 F.Supp.2d 111\n(D.D.C. 2003).\nDeclaratory relief is applicable when there is an “actual\ncontroversy,” which has been defined as “a controversy of\nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a\ndeclaratory judgment.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, et\nal. v. Johnson, 276 F.Supp.2d 79, 81 (D.D.C. 2003).  Even in\nthose cases, however, the District Court retains the discretion\nto withhold declaratory relief.  Id.  \nThe actions that Plaintiff complains of were done in\naccordance with the BOP policy and procedures, although the\nPlaintiff argues that those actions violated the RFRA.  He also\ninsists that the policies must be amended to the extend that they\ndeny the relief he is seeking.  However, Plaintiff is not\n- 37 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 40 of 52\nentitled to relief because he has failed to meet his burden under\nRFRA and Turner, supra, and is not entitled to a judgment in his\nfavor.\nTransfer\nIf the action is not dismissed, the Court should transfer\nthis action to the Eastern District of Texas pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1404(a), for the convenience of the parties and\nwitnesses and in the interest of justice.11  See Starnes v.\nMcGuire, 512 F.2d 918, 927-31 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (in assessing\nwhether transfer is appropriate in prisoner cases, the court\nshould consider such factors as the difficulty in communicating\nwith counsel, difficulty in transferring the prisoner, the\navailability of witnesses and files and speed of final\nresolution).\nIn this case, the factors identified in Starnes and in\nSection 1404(a) strongly support transfer to the District of\nPlaintiff's incarceration.  Even if Plaintiff had alleged facts\n11  28 U.S.C. § 1404 (a) provides:\n     For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in\nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer\nany civil action to any other district or division\nwhere it might have been brought.\n    \n     This statutory provision for transfer applies as well to\ncivil actions in which there are special venue provisions outside\nof U.S.C. Title 28.  Smithkline Corp. v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 406\nF. Supp. 52 (D.C. Del. 1975).\n- 38 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 41 of 52\ngiving rise to an articulable, concrete injury arising from the\nwrongs he alleges, this action would most appropriately be\nbrought in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. \nPlaintiff challenges actions witnessed by individuals located in\nthe State of Texas, allegedly causing injury to Plaintiff in the\nState of Texas, and the Plaintiff and his records are located in\nTexas.  Moreover, the decisions challenged by the Plaintiff were\nmade by the prison administrators in Texas.  See Attachment A:\nResponse to Administrative Remedy Request at the institution\nlevel.  \nThe fact that the Plaintiff challenges a policy assertedly\nformulated in BOP Central Office located in Washington, DC, does\nnot in itself require that the case remain in this district. \nBOP's current Program Statement allows that: “When necessary,\nWardens may identify alternative practices and implement the\nleast restrictive alternative consistent with the security and\norderly running of Bureau institutions.”  Program Statement\n5360.09 at 5.  Thus, even the current Central Office policy would\nallow exceptions to meet the “least restrictive alternative”\ncalled for in the RFRA.  This means that even if the Court were\nto reject the BOP Central Policy as not sufficiently tailored to\neach institution, the policy would stand given its exception\n“[w]hen necessary,” and the factual issue that would remain to be\nlitigated would be focused on the particular institution where\n- 39 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 42 of 52\nthe Plaintiff is housed.  The remaining facts relevant to that\ninquiry, and inquiry into Plaintiff's inconsistent statements\nregarding his religious preferences, would come from witnesses in\nFCI Beaumont, in the Eastern District of Texas.  As this Court\nhas explained “because the implementation of policy is at issue,\nand because that implementation took place [in the plaintiff’s\nplace of incarceration], venue is more appropriately laid\n[there].”  Levitan v.

Plaintiff, Brandon Creighton Sample, Federal Register\nNumber 33949-037, is currently incarcerated within the BOP.  He\nfirst arrived in BOP custody on June 12, 2000, as a presentence\nadmission.  See Declaration of Susan VanBaalen (\"VanBaalen\nDecl.\"), ¶ 8. \n2. Plaintiff was sentenced on March 1, 2001, to a term of\n168 months followed by three years supervised release for\nconspiracy to violate laws of the United States in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 371, conspiracy to commit money laundering in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1708, and aiding/abetting in possession\nof stolen mail matter.  The Judgment and Commitment Order\nreflects that the Court made a recommendation to the BOP that\n“[t]he defendant participate in the Comprehensive Residential\nDrug Abuse Treatment Program.” See Judgment and Commitment Order. \n3.  Plaintiff was designated to serve his sentence at the\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 45 of 52\nFederal Correctional Institution, in Beaumont (Low), in Beaumont,\nTexas.  Complaint, ¶ 5. \n4. Upon admission at a BOP facility, unit staff will enter\nthe inmate’s initial religious preference in the computerized\ndatabase system known as SENTRY.  The BOP does not require\ninmates to profess a religious preference or belief.  Inmates can\nchange their religious preferences at any time during their\nconfinement by submitting a written request to the institution\nchaplain.  The chaplain will approve the change in religious\npreference and will make the necessary entry reflecting such a\nchange in SENTRY.  See Program Statement 5360.07 (Aug. 25, 1997)\nat 3; Program Statement 5360.09 (Dec. 31, 2004) at 18; 28 C.F.R.\n§ 548.10(c).\n5. BOP records reflect that on June 15, 2000, the\nPlaintiff indicated he had no religious preference, see VanBaalen\nDecl., ¶ 8, but on May 18, 2001, while confined at the Federal\nCorrectional Institution in Bastrop, Texas, Plaintiff expressed a\npreference for the Protestant Religion.  Id.; Exhibit 1 (\"Print-\nout of Inmate History-Religion\").  \n6.   On September 17, 2001, the Plaintiff changed his\nreligious preference to Jewish.  Id.  Plaintiff has made no other\nchanges to his religious preference since then.  See id.  In\naccordance with BOP policy, inmates will not necessarily be\nallowed to participate in the religious activities or rituals of\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 46 of 52\none religion unless the inmate has professed adherence to that\nreligion.  28 C.F.R. § 548.10.\n7. In 2002, the BOP amended its policy to provide inmates \nmay receive “small amounts of wine” as part of a religious\nritual. See Program Statement 5360.08, Religious Beliefs and\nPractices (August 22, 2002).\n8. The administrative remedy database reflects that\nPlaintiff filed Administrative Remedy Request 349793, in which he\nrequested at least 3.5 ounces of wine every Friday and Saturday\nfor the Kuddish prayer and at least 3.5 ounces of wine four times\nduring the Passover Seder.  Declaration of Harrell Watts (\"Watts\nDecl.\"), ¶ 3; Exhibit 2 (Administrative Remedy Forms) at 1-2. \nThis request was denied.  Exhibit 2 at 3.\n9.  Plaintiff appealed this decision to the Regional\nDirector and his appeal was denied.  Id.  at 4-6.  On November\n23, 2004, Plaintiff appeal to Central Office and this appeal was\nalso denied.  Id. at 7-9.  As the administrative remedy responses\nexplained, the restriction on wine consumption for inmates is\nbased on the need to maintain the secure and orderly running of\nthe institution and the institution is utilizing Kosher grape\njuice as it is an acceptable substitute for wine according to\nJewish law as confirmed by the Rabbi.  See Exhibit 2.  \n10.  Plaintiff has not raised the December 31, 2004 Program\nStatement in these Administrative Remedy forms; nor did he\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 47 of 52\npresent his request to have another staff member provide him wine\nwith his request to the institution.  See Watts Decl., ¶ 3;\nExhibit 2 at 1-2.\n11.  Defendants are restricting the use of wine based on the\nsignificant governmental interest of maintaining institution\nsecurity.  See VanBaalen Decl., ¶¶ 5-8, 11-14, 16-18; Declaration\nof Linda R. Thomas (\"Thomas Decl.\"), ¶¶ 4-11.\n12. There are legitimate penological interests for\nrestricting inmates access to alcohol, such as security and order\nof the prison, rehabilitation, punishment, deterrence of criminal\nbehavior, and a non-hostile work environment for prison staff.   \nThomas Decl., ¶ 4.\n13. Alcohol use in prison presents a serious threat to the\nsecurity of the BOP facilities, because inmates are susceptible\nto becoming violent when under the influence of alcohol. Prison\npopulations contain a higher incidence of persons with histories\nof violence than normally found in society at large.   Id., ¶ 5.\n14. In fact, according to a 1998 Bureau of Justice\nStatistics study, titled \"Alcohol And Crime, An Analysis of\nNational Data on the Prevalence of Alcohol Involvement in Crime,\" \nby Statistician Lawrence A. Greenfeld, at page 6 (Apr. 5, 1998)\n(see www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs): \nAmong the 5.3 million convicted offenders under the\njurisdiction of corrections agencies in 1996, nearly 2\nmillion, or about 36%, were estimated to have been\ndrinking at the time of the offense.\n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 48 of 52\nSee Thomas Decl., ¶ 6.\n15.  A similar link between alcohol consumption and violence\nis evidenced in another report titled:  \"Profile of Jail Inmates\n1996,\" at page 9  (Apr. 1998) (NCJ 164620) (see\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pji96.pdf):\nAmong convicted inmates 42% of the males and 30% of the\nfemales said they had been drinking alcoholic beverages\nwhen they committed their offense.\nAn estimated 42% of violent offenders said they were\nusing alcohol at the time of the offense. . . .\nSee Thomas Decl., ¶ 7.\n16. BOP policy provides that “[i]nmates may be permitted to\nreceive small amounts of wine as part of a religious ritual.”\nProgram Statement 5360.09, Program Statement 5360.08, Religious\nBeliefs and Practices, pages 15-16, Section 20 (August 22, 2002-\nChange Notice).  The BOP policy amended on December 31, 2004,\nstill allows inmates to receive “small amounts of wine.” See id.;\nThomas Decl., ¶ 8; VanBaalen Decl., ¶ 6.\n17.  The BOP has understandably concluded that alcohol\nconsumption and possession in federal prisons must generally be\nprohibited in order to protect the safety and security of the\nprisons.  See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 541.13 Table 3, Code 222\n(\"Making, possessing, or using intoxicants\" is regarded as a High\nCategory prohibited act).  In spite of this prohibition, from\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 49 of 52\nApril 2004 through March 2005, there were four thousand and\ntwenty-nine (4029) disciplinary incidents in all BOP institutions\ninvolving violations of the BOP’s prohibition on “making,\npossessing, or using intoxicants,” which total 18.4% of all 200\nlevel offenses.  See KI/SSS Key Indicators Strategic Support\nSystem (4/2004 through 3/2005).  Inmates under the influence of\nalcohol have a tendency to become assaultive; and fights over\nalcohol possessed in prison are commonplace.  See Thomas Decl., ¶\n9.\n18. Safety and security concerns will not permit the\naccommodation of Mr. Sample's request to permit him to ingest 3.5\nounces of wine every Friday and Saturday or 14 ounces of wine at\nthe annual Passover seder observance, even if low alcohol wine\nwere used.  Even the low alcohol wine proposed by Mr. Sample is\nlikely to have a negative impact on the safety and security of a\nprison if dispensed in anything other than small amounts under\nproper supervision.  The desire by many federal inmates to secure\nalcohol even at the risk of significant discipline is reflected\nin the BOP records of disciplinary action taken against federal\ninmates referenced above.  See Thomas Decl., ¶ 10.\n19. Another legitimate concern is the safety of the work\nenvironment of BOP employees, who are all considered correctional\nworkers first.  A staff member may be placed in a very dangerous\nsituation when required to control an area in which inmates are\n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 50 of 52\ndrinking alcohol or in which significant amounts of alcohol are\navailable.  Such circumstances would potentially lead some\ninmates wanting more alcohol to attempt to coerce other inmates\nand/or staff by threats, violence, or intimidation to obtain more\nalcohol than they are entitled to, resulting in disruptive and\nassaultive behavior among inmates and possibly involving staff. \nSee Thomas Decl., ¶ 11.\n20. BOP's current Program Statement reflects the least\nrestrictive alternative by providing inmates with kosher grape\njuice for the celebration or small amounts of wine dispensed\nunder specific supervision.  See Thomas Decl., ¶ 12; Program\nStatement 5360.09.\n21. The BOP allows Plaintiff to observe his religious holy\ndays; he is able to recite Kiddush on the required days and is\nable to participate in Passover Seder and the BOP also employs a \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 17      Filed 08/08/2005     Page 51 of 52\nRabbi who visits the institution periodically.

The Court will deny\nall the pending motions.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff, who describes himself as “an observant Jew,” brings this action against\nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”),\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1 et seq.  Compl. ¶¶ 1, 8.1  Generally, plaintiff alleges that BOP substantially\nburdens the free exercise of his religion by refusing to allow him to drink “at least 3.5 ounces of\nred wine (a reviit) while saying Kiddush, a prayer sanctifying the Sabbath,” and “four cups\ncontaining at least 3.5 ounces of wine during the Passover seder.”  Id. ¶¶ 9,10.\n1 Because the named defendants are BOP officials who are sued in their official\ncapacities only, all claims are treated as if they were raised against BOP itself.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 2 of 8\nII.  DISCUSSION\nA.  Burden-Shifting Analysis Under RFRA\n A plaintiff makes out  a prima facie claim under RFRA “by proving the following\nelements: (1) a substantial burden imposed by the federal government on a (2) sincere \n(3) exercise of religion.”  Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 960 (10th Cir. 2001).  If a plaintiff\nsuccessfully makes out a prima facie case, the defendant then must show that the burden placed\non the religious exercise is permissible.  See Gartrell v. Ashcroft, 191 F. Supp. 2d 23, 37 (D.D.C.\n2002) (applying burden-shifting analysis under RFRA).  A substantial burden on a person’s\nexercise of religion is permissible only if:\n[the government] demonstrates that application of the burden to the\nperson–\n(1)  is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b).  For purposes of RFRA, the term “demonstrates” means “meets the\nburdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(3).\nIn its March 31, 2006 Opinion and Order, the Court concluded that plaintiff had\nmade out a prima facie case under RFRA, in that the application of BOP regulations barring his\nconsumption of wine during the Sabbath and Passover rituals substantially burdens the exercise\nof his sincerely held religious beliefs.  Sample v. Lappin, 424 F. Supp. 2d 187, 193-95 (D.D.C.\n2006).  The Court found that the government has a compelling interest in controlling alcohol\nconsumption and intoxicants in BOP facilities, but that there remained a question of fact as to\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 3 of 8\nwhether an outright ban on plaintiff’s consumption of wine as part of a religious ritual is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that interest.  Id. at 195-96.  The Court therefore granted the\nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment in part and denied them in part.  Id. at 196.\nB.  Defendants’ Motion to Reconsider Grant of Partial Summary\n        Judgment for Plaintiff and to Dismiss the Case as Moot\n1.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Not Moot, and His Available\n   Administrative Remedies Have Been Exhausted\nIn February 2006, plaintiff was transferred from the Federal Correctional\nInstitution in Beaumont, Texas (“FCI Beaumont”) to the Federal Correctional Institution in\nJesup, Georgia (“FCI Jesup”).  Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as Moot, or, in the Alternative, to Reconsider Grant of Partial\nSummary Judgment for Plaintiff and to Transfer and in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for\nReconsideration (“Defs.’ Mot.”), Attach. 1 (Stephens Decl.) ¶ 3.  For this reason, defendants\nargue that the decision of  FCI Beaumont’s Warden to deny plaintiff’s request to drink wine\nduring religious observances is no longer applicable, and that plaintiff’s claims therefore are\nmoot.  See id. at 5-6.  Defendants also argue that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies with the Warden and through the administrative procedures at FCI Jesup under the\nrevised Program Statement currently in effect, P.S. 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices\n(12/31/2004), contrary to the requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997e(a).  Id.2\n2 Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, “[n]o action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a\nprisoner confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative\n(continued...)\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 4 of 8\nPlaintiff demonstrates, however, not only that FCI Jesup’s Warden has denied his\nrequest for wine in the quantities plaintiff specifies during the Sabbath and Passover observances,\nbut also that he has exhausted his administrative remedies at FCI Jesup under the revised\nProgram Statement.  See Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as Moot or, in\nthe Alternative, to Reconsider Grant of Partial Summary Judgment for Plaintiff and to Transfer\n(“Pl.’s Opp’n”), Ex. A-D (April 20, May 1, and May 9, 2006 Inmate Requests to Staff);\nPlaintiff’s Notice of Filing (Sept. 27, 2006), Ex. 2 (Aug. 22, 2006 Response to Regional Remedy\nAppeal No. 414949-R1); Plaintiff’s Notice of Filing (Nov. 27, 2006), Ex. 2 (Nov. 8, 2006\nResponse to Administrative Remedy Number 414949-A1).  \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss on the ground of mootness and for failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies therefore will be denied.\n2.   Plaintiff Shows that His Religious Beliefs are Sincere\nIn defendants’ view, plaintiff has failed to show that he holds a sincere belief in\ndrinking wine as part of his religious rituals.  Defs.’ Mot. at 8.  At most, defendants argue,\nplaintiff shows “that for the past four years he has identified himself as Jewish in the BOP’s\nrecords.  His adherence to the Jewish faith alone, however, does not show that he has a sincerely\nheld belief to drink wine.”  Id.  Furthermore, defendants find fault with the Court’s acceptance of\nplaintiff’s “conclusory statements about his belief in drinking wine in the amounts he seeks [and]\nthat he has been active in the practice of the Jewish faith at the different BOP institutions in\nwhich he has been housed.”  Id. at 12.  \n2(...continued)\nremedies as are available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 5 of 8\nAs this Court previously has held, the Court’s “scrutiny extends only to whether a\nclaimant sincerely holds a particular belief and whether the belief is religious in nature.”  Sample\nv. Lappin, 424 F. Supp. 2d at 193 (quoting Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 476 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(citing Patrick v. LeFavre, 745 F.2d 153, 157 (2d Cir. 1984)).  While it is not proper to “ask\nwhether a particular belief is appropriate or true,” the Court is presumed capable of evaluating\nthe sincerity with which a person holds a religious belief.  Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d at 476; cf.\nGartrell v. Ashcroft, 191 F. Supp. 2d 23, 39 (D.D.C. 2002) (concluding that BOP officials “not\nonly are permitted to assess bona fides but are required to do so where defendants’ actions\nimpose a substantial burden on plaintiffs’ sincere religious beliefs”).  \nPlaintiff’s verified complaint and declaration in support of his cross-motion for\nsummary judgment reflect not only his Jewish faith, but also a sincere belief that he must\nconsume 3 to 5 ounces of wine every Friday and Saturday during the saying of Kiddush and four\n3 to 5 ounce portions of wine during the Passover Seder.  See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 9-10; Sample Decl. \n¶¶ 1-2, 8, 15.  The Court was not persuaded earlier and is not persuaded now that the delay in\ndeclaring his religious preference or in pursuing inmate grievances to request wine for religious\nrituals is probative of the sincerity with which plaintiff holds his beliefs.  See Sample v. Lappin,\n424 F. Supp. 2d at 193.3  Defendants’ motion for reconsideration on this ground will be denied.  \n3 Furthermore, at this late date defendants are not entitled to discovery.  Had they\nbelieved discovery was necessary in order to respond to plaintiff’s motion for summary\njudgment, they could have sought appropriate discovery under Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure rather than responding to the merits of plaintiff’s motion without discovery.  The\nRule 56(f) procedure is not available on a motion to reconsider.  Since genuine issues of material\nfact remain in this case, both plaintiff and defendants will be able to proceed under the normal\ndiscovery rules as the case progresses.\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 6 of 8\n3.  The Court will Deny Defendants’ Motion to Transfer\nThe Court will deny defendants’ motion to transfer this case to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Georgia.  Plaintiff is challenging a national policy and,\nas he suggests, discovery involving officials or staff at BOP’s Washington, D.C. headquarters\nmay be required.  See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion\nfor Reconsideration (“Pl.’s Mot.”) at 16-17.  As the case develops, however, if either party or if\nthe parties jointly conclude that transfer of this action for trial is appropriate, the Court, of course,\nwill entertain a renewed motion.\nC.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration\nPlaintiff takes exception to the Court’s finding of a compelling government\ninterest.  See Pl.’s Mot. at 1.  Notwithstanding BOP’s compelling interest in controlling alcohol\nconsumption within BOP facilities generally, according to plaintiff, BOP fails to “demonstrate\nthat there was a compelling governmental interest through application of [its] policies to Plaintiff\nhimself.”  Id.  \n“[T]he compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged\nlaw ‘to the person’ – the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being\nsubstantially burdened.”  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Unaio Do Vegetal, 126 S.Ct.\n1211, 1220 (2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)).  BOP must “look[] beyond broadly\nformulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinize[]\nthe asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.”  Id.  The\nSupreme Court has observed, however, that “there may be instances in which a need for\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 7 of 8\nuniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA.” \nId. at 1224.\nDefendants not only show that there are “legitimate penological interests for\nrestricting inmates access to alcohol,” Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for\nSummary Judgment, Thomas Decl. ¶ 4, but also provide an explanation of how recognized\n“[s]afety and security concerns will not permit the accommodation of [plaintiff’s] request . . . to\ningest 3.5 ounces of wine every Friday and Saturday, or 14 ounces of wine at the annual Passover\nSeder observance, even if low alcohol wine were used.”  Id. ¶ 10.  Plaintiff’s request for wine\n“would amount annually to almost 6 gallons of wine,” they say, and wine in the quantities he\nproposes “is likely to have a negative impact on the safety and security of a Prison.”  Id.,\nVanBaalen Decl. ¶¶ 11, 12.  \nPlaintiff concedes that controlling alcohol consumption in prisons is a compelling\ngovernment interest.  See Sample v. Lappin, 424 F. Supp. 2d at 195.  The question is what is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering the government’s compelling interest, and that is a question\non which the government will have the burden at trial.  Id. at 195-96.\nAccordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED that plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration [Dkt. #33] is DENIED; it is\nFURTHER ORDERED that defendants’ motions to reconsider [Dkt. #36] and to\ndismiss as moot [Dkt. #36] are DENIED, and their motion to transfer [Dkt. #36] is DENIED\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE; and it is\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 46      Filed 03/28/2007     Page 8 of 8\nFURTHER ORDERED that a status conference is scheduled for April 27, 2007 at\n9:15 a.m. in Courtroom 29A of the William B.

Complaint, ¶¶ 9-10. \nPlaintiff has failed to show he has a sincerely held belief in drinking wine as part of his religious\nrituals and that the BOP policy substantially burdened his religious practice.  In any event, the\npolicy plaintiff seeks to challenge is justified by the government’s compelling interest in\nmaintaining security in the prison system.  The BOP has also met the least restrictive means test\nin RFRA by offering Plaintiff several alternatives to satisfy his alleged belief in the use of wine,\nbut the plaintiff has refused those alternatives. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 4 of 53\nARGUMENT\n[The RFRA] was enacted to overturn Employment Div., Dep't of Human\nResources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876\n(1990), a decision which held that the First Amendment permits governments to\napply neutral generally applicable laws to religious practice without a showing of\na compelling state interest.  Cutter [v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 125 S.Ct. 2113,\n2118 (2005)]; Caldwell v. Caesar, 150 Supp.2d 50, 55 (D.D.C. 2001).  RFRA\nprovides that a government “shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of\nreligion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the\ngovernment demonstrates that it “is in furtherance of a compelling government\ninterest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernment interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb.\nJefferson v. Gonzales, Civil Action No. 05-442 GK, 2006 WL 1305224, *2 (D.D.C. May 10,\n2006).\nThe RFRA requires the Plaintiff to demonstrate that a government action substantially\nburdens his sincerely held religious beliefs.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) and § 2000b-2(3).  But,\nwhere the plaintiff has established that his religious practices have been substantially burdened\nby the BOP, “the burden is on the Defendants to prove that the policy is the least restrictive\nmeans of achieving a compelling interest.”  Jefferson v. Gonzales, Civil Action No. 05-442 GK,\n2006 WL 1305224 at *2 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)(2)).\nIn applying the compelling interest test, “context matters.” Gonzalez v. O\nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, --- U.S. ----, ----, 126 S.Ct. 1211,\n1221, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006), quoting Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327,\n123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003).  The BOP has the statutory duty of\nproviding for the safety of inmates.  See 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a).  Prison officials\nhave broad administrative and discretionary authority over the institutions they\nmanage.  See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 467, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675\n(1983).  Courts are to afford deference and flexibility to officials trying to manage\nthe safety of the prison environment.  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 482, 115\nS.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).  “[P]rison security is a compelling state\ninterest” and “deference is due to institutional officials' expertise in this area.” \nCutter, 125 S.Ct. at 2124 n.13.\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 5 of 53\nJefferson v. Gonzales, Civil Action No. 05-442 GK, 2006 WL 1305224 at *3.  In Jefferson, the\nCourt concluded that the BOP had met this burden in its restrictions on the wearing of turbans by\ninmates.  Jefferson v. Gonzales, Civil Action No. 05-442 GK, 2006 WL 1305224 at *2-*4.  A\nsimilar result is merited here.1\nI. GENUINE ISSUES EXIST AS TO THE SINCERITY OF PLAINTIFF’S PURPORTED\nBELIEF IN THE USE OF WINE DURING RELIGIOUS RITUALS\nOne of the most delicate issues a court may be confronted with is the examination of the\nreligious beliefs of a litigant who is incarcerated.  Congress, in passing RFRA, attempted to\nprotect one of the “most treasured birthrights of every American”, “the right to observe one’s\nfaith, free from Government interference.”  S. Rep. No.111, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 1993, 1993\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1892, 1893-94 (Leg. Hist.).  In so doing, Congress intended “a workable balancing\nof the legitimate interests of prison administrators with the Nation’s tradition of protecting the\nfree exercise of religion.” Id. at 1899.  \nCongress did not define the precise contours of the elements of the RFRA test and as a\nresult, summoned courts to look for guidance at cases decided prior to the Department of Human\nResources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), which overruled the compelling\ngovernmental interest test.  See 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1898-99.  In one of those cases, the\nSupreme Court asserted that “the very concept of ordered liberty precludes allowing every person\nto make his own standards on matters of conduct [namely, religious beliefs or practice] in which\n1  Defendants recognize that a favorable ruling on the least restrictive means issue would\nmoot out the question of whether Plaintiff can establish that the BOP has substantially burdened\nhis sincerely held religious beliefs.  Defendants nevertheless feel compelled to address first the\nmisconceptions regarding Plaintiff’s past claims, because such inconsistencies as have been\nidentified in Plaintiff’s claims of sincerity are recognized even by Plaintiff’s expert as significant\nin his assessment of whether offering wine to a particular prisoner is appropriate. \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 6 of 53\nsociety as a whole has important interests.”  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215-16 (1972). \nThis statement holds especially true in the prison setting.  Although courts will not examine the\ntruth of a belief, courts are “presumed capable of evaluating the sincerity with which a person\nholds a religious belief.”  Sample v. Lappin, 470 F.Supp.2d 120, 123 (D.D.C. 2007).  “. .\n.[W]hile the “truth” of a belief is not open to question, there remains the significant question of\nwhether it is ‘truly held.’”  Thacker v. Dixon, 784 F.Supp. 286 (E.D.N.C. 1991) (quoting United\nStates v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185 (1965)). \n Courts must be cautious to separate real from fictitious religious beliefs.  See id. (quoting\nThomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 713-16 (1981)).  In so\ndoing, a court may also consider “whether the litigants are merely relying on a self-serving view\nof religious practice.”  Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Mr. Sample\nrelies on his own self-serving view of Judaism and the religious practice.  This does not meet the\nRFRA standard.\nA. Prior to incarceration, Brandon Sample was not practicing Judaism with any\nregularity and only participated in rituals two or three times in his life.\nBrandon Sample, Register No. 33949-037, mastermind of a conspiracy to commit money\nlaundering, abetting the possession of counterfeit security and aiding and abetting the possession\nof stolen mail matter is serving his sentence of one hundred and sixty eight months in BOP\ncustody.  Mr. Sample filed a complaint in which he asserts that he has a sincerely held belief in\ndrinking wine during Jewish religious rituals, which at that time only included the ceremonies to\ncommemorate the Sabbath2 and the Passover Seder.3  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 9-12).  \n2  Shabbos and Shabbat both are the Hebrew word for Sabbath.  The Holy Sabbath is\nconsidered as \n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 7 of 53\nIn his complaint, Plaintiff stated that he “believes that he must drink at least 3.5 ounces of\nred wine while saying Kiddush . . . during Friday night and Saturday shabbos services.” \nComplaint, ¶ 9.  He also stated that “he must drink four cups containing at least 3.5 ounces of\nwine during the Passover seder.”  Id., ¶ 10.  He proclaimed this belief was dictated by “Jewish\nsages, the Code of Jewish Law, and by practice.”  Id., ¶ 9.  Plaintiff claimed to be “an observant\nJew [who] practiced Judaism before his incarceration . . .” Id., ¶ 8.  “For example, before his\nincarceration, plaintiff said Kiddush over wine during his Friday night and Saturday morning\n. . . the most important of all Jewish Holy days.  The Sabbath is considered as a sign to\nbear witness that, ‘In six days God made the heavens and the earth and that is in them,\nand He rested on the seventh day.  This belief, that God is the creator of the universe, is\nthe foundation of the Jewish faith.  \nThe Sabbath begins 18 minutes before sunset on Friday night and ends approximately one\nhour after sunset on Saturday night.\nExhibit 1:  Institutional Handbook of Jewish Practice and Procedure, at 4-1 (9/98)(“Handbook”).  \n3  Passover Seder is described as follows:  \nThe two Passover Seders are not simply ‘meals’ - they are religious rituals that require\ncertain foods as part of their proper observance.  Observant Jews are obligated to partake\nin two Seders on Passover, on the first two eves of the holiday.\nDuring the Seder, the ‘Haggadah’ is recited.  The Haggadah is a collection of prayers,\nsongs and text recounting the Exodus from Egypt.\nMatzo, bitter herbs and wine (or grape juice), ‘Charoses’ (see below), a chicken neck or\nother piece of roasted meat, horseradish and romaine lettuce, potatoes, onions, salt water\nand a hard-boiled whole egg are religious items that are required to complete the Seder\nrituals, as are the other foods comprising a religious meal.\nAmong other rituals, Jews are mandated to drink four cups of wine at each of the two\nSeders. . . .  If, however, for health or other reasons, wine is unavailable, kosher grape\njuice may be used instead.\nHandbook, at 6-20.  \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 8 of 53\nshabbos services.”  Id., ¶ 9.  \nPlaintiff later explains his early involvement with Judaism as follows:\nAround my 14th birthday, I began to seriously examine the Jewish religion, including\nstudying the Torah, the Talmud, and the Code of Jewish Law.\nAt the age of 17, I left my parents home, and lived by myself.  During this time, I was\nable to explore, and practice Judaism, although my level of observance at the time was\nsporadic.  I observed Shabbat in my home, and occasionally attended Congregation Beth\nYeshurun in Houston.  During Shabbat, I would always say Kiddush over wine and\nchallah bread.  During Pesach, I would always drink four glasses of wine ...\n(September 20, 2005 Declaration of Brandon Sample, ¶¶ 17-18, found as Exhibit 1 to the\nPlaintiff’s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count I, and Response to Defendants’\nMotion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment or to Transfer, filed September\n29, 2005)(hereinafter Pl.’s Cross-Mot.).\nPlaintiff then explained that his “occasional” attendance at the Congregation of Beth\nYeshurun consisted of attending worship 2 or 3 times for Sabbath between 1998 and 2000.  See\nExhibit 2 (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. Nos. 14-15).  His “sporadic” observance of\nthe Sabbath consisted of participating in Kiddush no more than two or three times.  See Exhibit 3\n(Deposition Transcript of Brandon Sample (“Sample Depo.”) at  46), that on those occasions he\nused red wine (id. at 47), and that during the ritual he was the only person present. (Id. at 101). \nPlaintiff celebrated the ritual of Passover Seder at his home one or two times between 1998-\n2000, and he celebrated it according to his “own knowledge and understanding of how things\nwork.”  (Id. at 99).  See also Exhibit 2 (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 18).  \nAdditionally, prior to his incarceration, Plaintiff’s “serious” study of Judaism did not\ninclude seeking spiritual guidance from any Rabbis, studying with others or following the\n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 9 of 53\nreligious practices of his parents, who do not practice the Jewish faith.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery\nResponses, Inter. Nos. 5, 9).  Plaintiff’s beliefs are based on the Code of Jewish Law and the\nJewish Book of Why (see Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. No. 11; Complaint, ¶ 9; Sample\nDepo. at 101), but Plaintiff does not accept what a Rabbi says, and he disagrees with the Code of\nJewish Law insofar as it “deem[s] it permissible for a healthy adult to make Kiddush over grape\njuice, boiled wine, or diluted wine.”  See Sample Depo. at 104, see also id. at 34-35 (Plaintiff\ndisagrees with Rabbis); Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 18.  In spite of only\ncelebrating Kiddush by himself on two or three occasions prior to incarceration, Plaintiff claims\nhe “knows” that “no one” uses matzoh during Kiddush.  (Sample Depo. at 100).  At the same\ntime Plaintiff asserts he was “practicing” Judaism between 1998 and 2000, he was only nineteen\nyears old and the mastermind of a conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States.  See\nPlaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. Nos. 1-5.  This is the Plaintiff. \nThroughout this litigation, Plaintiff has made contradictory statements.  In his Complaint,\nhe suggests that he was practicing Judaism long before incarceration (see Complaint, ¶ 8) and, he\nmaintains, he would “always” drink wine during Sabbath and Passover rituals.  September 20,\n2005 Declaration of Brandon Sample, ¶¶ 17-18.  Later, he has stated that his level of observance\nwas sporadic and that he only participated in each ritual two or three times before incarceration. \nPlaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. Nos. 4-7 and Admis. No. 14.  Plaintiff also states that he\nbegan to “seriously” study Judaism at age 14, yet before his incarceration he never sought\nguidance from a Rabbi and only attended a place of worship two times.  See September 20, 2005\nDeclaration of Brandon Sample, ¶¶ 17-18; Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. Nos. 5-7.  It\nwould be without foundation to conclude, as Plaintiff has suggested in his Complaint, that\n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 10 of 53\nPlaintiff practiced Judaism with any consistency prior to his incarceration or that he “seriously”\nstudied Judaism.  His participation in a ritual two or three times in his life, does not support the\nimplication in his Complaint that he was practicing the Jewish faith with any regularity.  At a\nminimum, this and the remaining bases to doubt his assertions raise a genuine issue that should\nbe addressed by the Court if the matter were ever to reach a hearing requiring the taking of\ntestimony.\nThe Court of Appeals has looked at inmates’ former practices “for years prior to their\nincarceration” to show that the drinking of wine was not “an unimportant part of [his] religious\npractice.”  See Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 2002).4  In this case, Mr.\nSample partook of the wine for the Sabbath and Passover on two or three occasions.  Plaintiff’s\nDiscovery Responses, Inter. Nos. 5-7.  In contrast with Levitan, Plaintiff’s observance of the\nrituals prior to incarceration shows that partaking of the wine during the religious rituals was not\nan important part of his religious practice before his incarceration.  His level of observance\nreflects that he could not have had the level of spirituality and religiousness to state that he\n“practiced Judaism,” not in accordance with the framework recognized in Levitan.  \nB. Mr. Sample’s Level of Observance increased During  his Incarceration\nImmediately Prior to this Litigation.\nIn his Complaint, Plaintiff contended that “he continue[d] his practice of Judaism while\nconfined.  Plaintiff frequently attends Jewish services, events, etc . . .”  (Complaint, ¶ 8).\nHowever, he later explains that in 2000, he did not partake in any observances and in 2001, he\n4  Although Levitan involved a claim under the First Amendment, the analysis for the\nsincerely held belief is similar under both standards.\n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 11 of 53\nparticipated in an occasional Sabbath during the Summer months.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery\nResponses, Inter. No. 17) (Exhibit 2).  He alleges that it was not until 2002 that he observed the\nSabbath weekly, Yom Kippur5 and Rosh Hashanah6, and from 2003-2007, he observed the\nSabbath weekly and the rituals of Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and observed the other\nreligious holy days of Succos, Purin, Shavuos, Tisha B’av, Fast of Ester, Fast of Tevet, Fast of\nGedliah, and the Fast of Tamzuz.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. No. 17).  Plaintiff\nasserts he developed a higher level of spirituality and decided to commit to learning, exploring\nand practicing Judaism as part of his daily life.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No.\n16).  This is the same person who said he “seriously” studied Judaism at the same time he\nengaged in a criminal enterprise.  \nPlaintiff’s sincerity in a religious belief to drink wine is highly suspect.  He admits to\nbeing a social drinker.  (Sample Depo. at 110-111; Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No.\n11 (“Plaintiff admits that he enjoys drinking liquor and wine socially like many other adults. .\n.”)).  His BOP records raise questions about his adherence to Judaism.  (See Inmate History\nReligion found in Exhibits 6 and 1, to the August 8, 2005 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss or, in\nthe Alternative, for Summary Judgment or to Transfer (hereinafter “Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss”)).  \nAlthough Plaintiff’s BOP records may not be determinative of his faith now, the\n5  Yom Kippur is considered the day of atonement.  “The holiest and most solemn day of\nthe Jewish year, it is the only Biblically-mandated holiday that is also a fast day.  Its central\ntheme is repentance, atonement and reconciliation, and the day customarily is fully occupied with\nprayer.  Handbook, at 6-5.\n6  Rosh Hashanah is the “Jewish spiritual New Year, [and it] is characterized by prayer,\nrepentance and the blowing of a complicated series of blasts on the shofar at and throughout the\nmorning/afternoon prayer service.”  Handbook, 6-2.\n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 12 of 53\ninconsistency in his religious affiliation and the exaggerations in his Complaint, as well as his\ncriminal convictions, give strong reason to question his credibility.  Moreover, his delay in\nidentifying himself to BOP as Jewish raises a question about the legitimacy of his belated claim\nto have a sincerely held belief in the need for wine.  BOP records reflect that he did not identify\nhimself as Jewish until September 17, 2001, after more than fifteen months of being in custody. \nSee, e.g., Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 19; Inmate History-Religion.  Consistent\nwith that, his first administrative remedy request regarding a religious accommodation is dated\nSeptember 14, 2001.  See Exhibit 4 (Declaration of Bruce Plumley), ¶ 5.  For an inmate so\nfamiliar with the administrative remedy system, who filed 12 requests within the first seventeen\nmonths of being in custody, it is clear that the practice of Judaism was not as important to him. \nSee id.   \nIn addition, Plaintiff did not enroll in the religious diet (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses,\nAdmis. No. 19) and did not participate in the Sabbath weekly until 2002, two years after coming\ninto BOP custody. (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. No. 17).  His enrollment in the\nreligious diet was sporadic as he was removed from it several times possibly because of\nnoncompliance and he also withdrew from the religious diet at one point.  (Sample Depo. at 70-\n71).  These actions are not consistent with his previous statements that he practiced Judaism\nduring his incarceration. \nMoreover, Plaintiff waited four years after his incarceration to file his first administrative\nremedy request for wine.  See Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 20.  It is noteworthy\nthat Plaintiff’s tendency to file administrative remedy requests continues for the rest of his\nincarceration.  BOP records reflect that from June 12, 2000, (the date he arrived in BOP custody)\n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 13 of 53\nuntil the time he filed the first administrative remedy request for wine on August 31, 2004,\nplaintiff had filed a total of one hundred and twenty nine administrative remedy requests.  See\nPlumley Decl., ¶ 8.  It is a telling statement that, although Plaintiff was so familiar with the\nadministrative remedy system, he waited almost four years formally to request wine.\nPlaintiff asserts that upon arriving in prison, he was confused and “overwhelmed with\nemotion.”  (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 19).  He also asserts that BOP records were inaccurate and that he\ncorrected the mistake when he realized his religious affiliation was identified as Protestant.  (Id.,\n¶ 27).  However, the fact remains that it took him 15 months to file an administrative remedy\nrequest regarding his alleged religion, two years to enroll in the religious diet and practice the\nSabbath weekly, and four years following his arrival in BOP custody to request wine for the\nJewish religious rituals in which he asserts to have a sincerely held belief that precedes\nincarceration.  \nMoreover, he asserts he has a sincerely held belief in the use of wine during these rituals\nin which he participated one or two times in his lifetime, by himself, prior to entering prison. \nSee Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. Nos. 6-7.  If his statements were true, it is highly\nsuspect that he only participated in the rituals once or twice prior to incarceration and that it took\nhim so long to identify himself as a Jewish person, to enroll in the religious diet, to make a\nrequest regarding his religion, and that it took him approximately four years to request the wine\nthrough the administrative remedy procedures.  Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. Nos. 16-\n17 and Admis. Nos. 14-15, 17, 19-20.  This is not the behavior of an inmate with a sincerely held\nbelief in drinking wine for religious reasons.  Indeed, his alleged sincerely held belief in drinking\nwine during the Kiddush and Passover is highly questionable and he has failed to meet that\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 14 of 53\nburden.  \nInstead, Plaintiff has merely shown that for the last four years he has identified himself as\nJewish in the BOP’s records.  His adherence to the Jewish faith alone, however, does not show\nthat he has a sincerely held belief to drink wine.  The inconsistencies in his statements and\nactions shed light into his mindset.  Plaintiff merely seized the opportunity to obtain wine under\nthe pretense of a belief that coincidentally blossomed while in prison.  There is no reason why an\nindividual who sincerely believes in the consumption of wine during the rituals since before his\nincarceration would take four years to request the wine, or take two years to enroll in the\nreligious diet and participate in the Sabbath weekly, or participate and partake of the wine in the\nrituals two or three times before his incarceration.  Instead, it is more likely that he simply wishes\nto “enjoy[] drinking . . . wine socially like many other adults. . .” See Plaintiff’s Discovery\nResponses, Admis. No. 11. Plaintiff has failed to meet the RFRA standard. \nC. Plaintiff’s Practices and Beliefs Significantly Changed during the Pendency of this\nAction\nDuring the pendency of this action, Plaintiff’s allegedly sincere beliefs have been in\nconstant flux.  In his complaint, he first stated that he believes in drinking 3.5 ounces of wine for\nthe Sabbath observance and four glasses of 3.5 ounces of wine for the Passover Seder. \nSubsequently, the Plaintiff changed the initial amount of wine (3.5 ounces) he seeks to 3 to 5\nounces of wine for each ritual. (See Pl.’s Cross-mot. at 3-4 and Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 2 (“It is my\nsincerely held religious belief that I must consume between 3 to 5 ounces of wine every Friday\nand Saturday during the saying of Kiddush . . . . and 3 to 5 ounces of wine four times during the\nPesach . . . Seder.”).  Cf Complaint, ¶¶ 9-10 (stating “Plaintiff sincerely believes that he must\n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 15 of 53\ndrink at least 3.5 ounces of red wine while saying Kiddush ... [and] 3.5 ounces of wine during\nPassover seder.”). \nPlaintiff changed his belief to state that he needs 3 to 5 ounces of wine during the\nPassover Seders and mentions two rituals.  See Exhibit 5 (Inmate Request to Staff Member, April\n13, 2006).  Most recently, although Plaintiff has never participated in the ritual of havdalah,7 he\nhas stated that “it is my sincerely and important belief that I must consume 3 to 5 ounces of\nKosher red wine during the hadvolah [sic] in addition to the other Sabbath rituals every week.” \n(Sample Depo. at  88-89). (See also Exhibit 6: Administrative Remedy Request 475362, dated\nDecember 3, 2007).  He has not met any other Jewish inmates who observe the havdalah ritual in\nprison.  (Sample Depo. at 88-89).  But Plaintiff still wants the wine to observe this newly added\nritual.  Id.  Plaintiff has received the following offer: “[c]onsistent with your asserted religious\nneeds and the facility’s duty to maintain security and good order, it has been determined to allow\nyou to receive kosher grape juice; three ounces of kosher grape juice with a drop of low-alcohol\nkosher wine; or a three-ounce mixture of a low-alcohol kosher wine and water, approximately\none part wine and five parts water.  If you desire the three-ounce water and wine mixture, the\nabove grape juice options would be available for the other three glasses requested for the\nPassover Seders.”  Id.; see also Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 18.  Plaintiff\nappealed, but after further review within the Bureau of Prisons, the agency concurred with the\ninstitution’s offer. \n7 The Havdalah service is a “solemnization of the Sabbath’s parting by a blessing over\nwine or grape juice, the sniffling of cloves or other aromatic incense and the lighting of a twined\nmulti-wicked candle or two flames from any source brought together to form a single ‘torch’ for\nthe duration of the ceremony.”  Institutional Handbook, 4-10.\n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 16 of 53\nThe evolution of the Plaintiff’s belief system reflects no differently than what the BOP\nprison security expert, David Rardin, describes as a “child in the candy store” effect.  He explains\nthat,\nFrom the prison administrator’s point of view, allowing an inmate to obtain wine in the\namounts of his preference is analogous to a child in a candy store.  There is no difference. \nA small child is overwhelmed by opportunity and wants all the candy.  In prison, wine is\nsomething different than the norm and it is an intoxicant.  All inmates are going to want\nit.  Prison administrators would carry a unique and heavy burden when the door is open to\noffer inmates considerable amounts of wine.  This is a very dangerous slippery slope that\nis predictable and will evolve into a cycle that would never stop.  The more the inmate\ngets the more the inmate wants.  A prime example of this slippery slope is present in this\ncase.  BOP policy allows the use of small amounts of wine for religious rituals.  Inmate\nSample seeks substantial amounts of wine which would further increase the use of wine in\nprison.\nSee Exhibit 7 (David Rardin’s Revised Expert Report, March 14, 2008) (emphasis added).  Mr.\nSample’s claimed sincerely held beliefs keep evolving in ways that demand a more frequent\nconsumption of wine, and thus larger amounts of wine each week.  His beliefs have changed\nfrom seeking wine for his religious rituals twice per week in the beginning of this litigation to\nthree times a week, and from one Passover Seder to two Passover Seders each year.\nAdditionally, while at Jesup, Plaintiff states he participated in all the Jewish religious\nrituals.  Indeed, he was an inmate representative for the other Jewish inmates.  See Exhibit 8\n(January 3, 2008 Deposition Transcript of Chaplain Raymond Ortiz) at  97:15-22).  Also, he had\nbeen the Jewish faith group representative while housed at Beaumont Low. (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶\n23).  These two institutions had a significant number of inmates who observed the Jewish rituals\nand plaintiff assumed somewhat of a leadership role in the Jewish community. (Id., ¶ 21, and\nOrtiz Depo. at 97). \nPlaintiff arrived in Texarkana on October 17, 2007.  Plaintiff states his religious practice\n- 14 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 17 of 53\nchanged when he arrived in Texarkana Camp.  In December of 2007, Plaintiff asserted that he\nhad continued to participate in the Jewish rituals in spite of the denial of the wine.  (Plaintiff’s\nDiscovery Responses, Admis. No. 26).  Just two months later, however, Plaintiff changed his\nstory and stated he was no longer saying kiddush while at Texarkana because he does not have\nwine and does not want to say it with grape juice or bread. (Sample Depo. at 78).  For the first\ntime, he now says that it is better not to participate in the rituals than to perform them wrongly,\ni.e., without wine.  (Id. at 107-108).  He explains that he participated in the rituals before absent\nwine, not because of his “sincerely held belief”, but out of respect to other Jewish inmates and\ntheir beliefs.  (Sample Depo. at 79).  He now states that although he had previously participated\nin the religious rituals between 100-500 times while incarcerated, he feels he never satisfied his\nobligation.  (Id. 79-80; see also Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 26).  At Texarkana\nCamp, there is only one other Jewish inmate and plaintiff no longer enjoys a “leadership role” in\nthe community.  It is not a coincidence that he now abandons practicing in his religious rituals\nwhile he is housed at Texarkana.\nIn a desperate attempt to justify the many inconsistencies in his beliefs and practices, he\nhas recently revealed that God spoke to him about stopping his participation in the rituals\n(Sample Depo. at 78), and that this is the reason why he has not participated in any rituals since\nhis arrival at Texarkana.  (Id. at 78-80).  Also recently, Plaintiff has asserted that the source of his\nbeliefs in the use of wine are his twenty or so conversations with God.  (Id. at 31-33).  These\nconversations, he now asserts, started at around the time he filed his first administrative remedy\nrequest while at Beaumont, but he failed to mention them ever before in this litigation or in the\nmany administrative remedy requests he has filed regarding religious issues.  (Id. at 49-50). \n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 18 of 53\nIndeed, in his Complaint, Plaintiff explained that the sources of his beliefs are “the Code of\nJewish law, the Jewish Sages, and by practice.”  (Complaint, ¶ 10).  He did not mention any\nconversations with God.  Nor, until faced in his deposition with the provisions in the Code of\nJewish Law that describe how to perform Jewish rituals in the absence of wine, did he ever state\nthat his contrary position was based on his personal conversations with God.  Indeed, Plaintiff\nacknowledged that no Rabbi has told him that it was unacceptable to use grape juice as a\nsubstitute for wine in the Jewish ritual.  Sample Depo. at 34-35.\nRegarding an inmate’s assertion that his purported need for wine is based on\nconversations with God, James Aiken, the Plaintiff’s own expert on prison security, has indicated\nthat he would question any inmate whose purported religious need for wine was based on\nclaimed discussions with God: “[a]nd certainly in this case, if that was said to me, to which it\nwasn’t, you know, that would cause negative -- more of a negative than a positive.”  (Exhibit 9:\nDeposition Transcript of James Aiken at 107-08).  Mr. Aiken further explains that if an inmate\ntold him, “. . . ‘God talked to me last night,’ and I won’t doubt that, ‘And he says that I can have\na bottle of wine in my cell to drink whenever I feel like it,’ I’m not going to grant that.”  (Id. at\n21-24).  Indeed, Mr. Aiken asserts he would be suspicious of something as unverifiable as the\nassertion of having conversations with God to justify a request for wine in prison.  (Id. at 107-\n09). \nAdditionally, Plaintiff claims to follow the teachings of Jewish sages8 and the Code of\nJewish Law, but he follows his own interpretation of Judaism regardless of what the Rabbis say\nor the Code of Jewish Law states, as he does not necessarily accept what they state.  See Sample\n8  Plaintiff defines sages as rabbis. (Sample Depo. at 81).\n- 16 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 19 of 53\nDepo. at 18-19; 34-35.  Indeed, Plaintiff has stated he would not accept what a Rabbi tells him.\n(Id.).  It is noteworthy that Mr. Sample wants a glass with 3 to 5 ounces of wine while in prison. \nHowever, Sample admits that in the community, while one person would drink the wine, he\nwould just drink a sip of wine.  (Id. at 41-42).  He admits this is an acceptable practice in the\ncommunity. (Id.)  Yet he rejected the BOP’s offers for the nonalcoholic wine, or the one drop of\nwine in grape juice, or the diluted wine which would be consistent with the amount of wine he\nwould obtain in the community.  See Inmate Request to Staff Member dated May 9, 2006 filed as\nExhibit C to Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as Moot, or, in the\nAlternative, to Reconsider Grant of Partial Summary Judgment for Plaintiff and to Transfer;\nExhibit 13 (Central Office Administrative Remedy Appeal 414949); Exhibit 6 (Regional\nAdministrative Remedy Appeal 475362).  \nPlaintiff asserts that if he had some interaction with the Rabbi or staff presiding over the\nritual and knew they were Jewish and sincere, it would be acceptable to him that the Rabbi or\nstaff consume the wine on his behalf. (Sample Depo. at 44-45).  In the restrictive prison\nenvironment, Plaintiff wants to know the sincerity of the person praying the kiddush while in the\ncommunity he did not even know the Rabbi in the synagogue he attended and who presided over\nthe rituals.  (Id. at 44).  He also admits the Code of Jewish Law does not require that the\nparticipant know the person presiding over the ritual. (Id. at 43).  \nPlaintiff readily admits that in the past, he has misrepresented facts to obtain benefits.\n(Sample Depo. at 51).  He previously represented himself as a Baptist University student to\nobtain a credit card.  (Id. at 50-51).  He was also convicted of a misdemeanor for attempting to\nobtain by fraud a prescription for codeine which he wanted for resale.  (Id. at 39).  Lastly, Mr.\n- 17 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 20 of 53\nSample was the mastermind of a conspiracy to defraud the government, which is the reason he is\nin federal prison.  At such a young age, his criminal history is already plagued with fraudulent\nacts.\nThis behavioral pattern has not changed during his incarceration.  In prison he continues\nto seek privileges under false pretense.  For example, he readily admits that it is his intention to\nparticipate in the BOP drug treatment program (id. at 38) even though he states he does not have\na substance abuse program and does not need treatment.  (Id. at 60).  The BOP drug abuse\ntreatment program was designed for non-violent offenders who are “determined to have a\nsubstance abuse problem,” Exhibit 10  (June 26, 1995 Program Statement 5330.10, Drug Abuse\nPrograms Manual), Chapter 6, at 1, and inmates who successfully complete the program become\neligible for a sentence reduction of up to one year.  18 U.S.C. § 3621(e).  Even knowing the\nintent of the program and that he does not need treatment, Plaintiff still intends to reap a benefit\nhe is not entitled to.  He states all inmates want to participate in the program because of the time\noff so it is justifiable for him to also want it, even if under false pretense.  See Sample Depo. at\n60.  \nFollowing this same line of reasoning, about 40% of the individuals incarcerated have\nbeen under the influence of alcohol or some intoxicants during the commission of the crime for\nwhich they are convicted.  See February 25, 2008 Deposition Transcript of David Rardin (Exhibit\n11) (“Rardin Depo.”) at 59.  Plaintiff may also want wine as it is a very valuable commodity or\ncurrency in prison.  Wine is desirable to other inmates just as desirable as the participation in the\ndrug abuse program.  He has already unequivocally stated that he enjoys alcohol and wine\nsocially.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 11; Sample Depo. at  47).  So, Plaintiff\n- 18 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 21 of 53\nintends to do both: obtain wine and participate in the drug abuse program.\nAdditionally, Mr. Sample seeks other benefits through claimed adherence to Judaism: a\ndiet with more vegetables and fruits, which is perceived by inmates as a healthier diet.  (Ortiz\nDepo. at 62-63).  Mr. Sample himself recognizes that about 50% of inmates participate in the\nreligious diet for non- religious reasons.  (Sample Depo. at 69).  Judaism is also the religion with\nthe most days of work proscription,9 a total of 13 days in a year, a significantly higher number of\ndays than all the other religions.  See Exhibit 12 (Days of Work Proscription).  Thus, inmates\nwho identify their preferred religion as Judaism get the most days off from work than any other\nreligious group. \nPlaintiff asserts he follows teachings of the Code of Jewish Law.  (Complaint, ¶ 9). \nHowever, Plaintiff qualifies this statement, as he chooses not to believe in the provisions that\ndeem it permissible for a healthy adult to make Kiddush over grape juice, boiled wine, or diluted\nwine.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 18).  Even though Plaintiff admits that, to\nhis knowledge, Judaism does not require a particular percentage of alcohol for the celebration of\nthe rituals. (Sample Depo. at 66 and Sample Depo. Exh. 5 (Code of Jewish Law) ). \nCourts have articulated that a religious belief must be more than just a philosophy or a\nway of life.  United States v. Meyers, 95 F.3d 1475 (10th Cir. 1996);  Thiry v. Carlson, 78 F.3d\n1491 (10th Cir. 1996).  The plaintiff has changed his beliefs so often that now it is more of a\npersonal preference.  He has changed the amounts of wine he seeks.  He has also changed the\n9 Judaism has 13 holy days per year of work proscription.  See Exhibit 12: Chaplaincy\nServices Guidance for the Recognition of Holy Days Calling for Work Proscription and Public\nFast Days (hereinafter Days of Work Proscription).  The second religion with the most holy days\nCatholicism with five days of work proscription.  See id.\n- 19 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 22 of 53\nnumber of rituals and has even added new rituals to his request.  He has also changed the\nfrequency in which he wants the wine.  The only thing constant in his request is that he wants\nwine with alcohol in it.  He has indicated that he likes wine and has consumed wine in the past.\n(Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 11; Sample Depo. at 47).  He also used codeine as\npart of his “experimenting” with drugs (Sample Depo. at 39), and used marijuana and cocaine\nsince a young age. (See Presentence Report, ¶¶ 82-83 submitted as Exhibit 15 of Pl.’s Cross-\nmot.).  Thus, Plaintiff enjoys consuming intoxicants, notwithstanding that one state judge has\nrequired his participation in Alcoholics Anonymous.  See Plaintiff’s Depo. at 58-59; Plaintiff’s\nDiscovery Responses, Admis. No. 9.\nA personal preference to consume intoxicants does not rise to the level of a sincerely held\nbelief under RFRA.  See Ochs v. Thalacker, 90 F.3d 293 (8th Cir. 1996)(stating that “[p]urely\nsecular views or personal preferences will not support a Free Exercise Clause claim.”)(quoting\nFrazee v. Illinois Employment Sec. Dept., 489 U.S. 829, 833 (1989)).\nUnder RFRA, the government cannot always substantially burden a person’s exercise of\nreligion.  “Inadequately formulated prison regulations and policies grounded on mere\nspeculation, exaggerated fears, or post-hac rationalizations will not suffice to meet the act’s\nrequirements.”  1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1900.  At the same time, courts must be mindful that\n“[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges\nand rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.”  Price v.\nJohnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285 (1948).  Under RFRA, the plaintiff bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that a sincerely held religious belief has been substantially burdened by the\ngovernment policies.  Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12 (D.C. Cir. 2001);  Jackson v. District\n- 20 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 23 of 53\nof Columbia, 89 F. Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2000).  As set forth herein and for the reasons previously\nset forth in support of Defendant’s earlier motion seeking partial reconsideration (Docket No.\n36), Plaintiff’s self-serving claims that he maintains a sincerely held religious belief are subject\nto substantial doubt.  Therefore, if the Court is not inclined to grant summary judgment in favor\nof Defendants for the reasons reflected herein, the Court should reverse the partial summary\njudgment rendered in favor of Plaintiff and consider the sincerity of his claims to remain at issue\nin the litigation.\nII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANTS ON THE\nISSUE OF THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS IS WARRANTED\nA. Plaintiff’s Security Expert Has Recognized the Need to Control Wine in Prison.\nPlaintiff’s security expert, James Aiken, recognizes that there are security concerns in\nallowing alcohol in prison.  Specifically, Mr. Aiken admits that allowing substantial amounts of\nwine in prison creates a security concern (Aiken Depo. at 24), that BOP must control the amount\nof wine inmates receive, (id. at 112), and that it is not always safe to give an inmate the amount\nof wine he wants. (Id. at 68-69, 81, 113).  Mr. Aiken opines that generally allowing alcohol to\nprison inmates is not consistent with the security and good order of the institution.  See Aiken\nDepo. at 68-69.  Indeed, Mr. Aiken believes that giving an inmate possession of 3 to 5 ounces of\nwine raises a security concern. (id. at 25).  Mr. Aiken explains that alcohol has to be controlled\n(id. at 80) because “[w]ine as with other substances, if not properly managed and controlled can\nbe detrimental to the operation of the facility.” (Id. at 81).  He asserts that inmates are more\ndisruptive and potentially violent inmates when using alcohol (Id. at 9, 68, 81) and that allowing\ninmates alcohol threatens the security of the institution.  (Id. 68, 81).  Mr. Aiken never agreed\n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 24 of 53\nwith Plaintiff that the use of low alcohol wine in prison is consistent with security (id. at 68-70)\nand in fact recognizes that inmates generally should not possess wine in prison.  (Id. at 77). \nMr. Aiken agrees with the general concept that prison administrators must anticipate\nproblems and be proactive instead of reactive.  (Id. at 47).  He has even resorted to the BOP\nmodel and methods in attempting to fix correctional systems plagued with administrative\ndeficiencies back in the 1990s when he was still working in prison.  (Id. at 82-83).  As the record\ndemonstrates, Mr. Sample does not meet the elements necessary for the accommodation of a\nreligious ritual involving the use of wine even under his expert’s theories.\nMr. Aiken developed a model to assess an inmate’s request for an intoxicant for religious\npurposes.  He states that he would examine the following factors: (1) if the religion has a long-\nstanding tradition (Id. at 89); (2) if the inmate has professed his religious faith (Id. at 90-91); (3)\nif the inmate adheres or complies with the mandates of his religion (Id.); (4) if the inmate\nexhibits good behavior while in prison (Id.); and finally, (5) the inmate’s reaction to the denial of\nhis request. (Id.).\nMr. Aiken asserts that an inmate’s compliance with the mandates of his religion is one of\nthe elements in favor of granting his request. (Id. at 90-91).  In this case, Mr. Aiken’s\nassumptions that BOP should accommodate Plaintiff’s request are based on his understanding\nthat inmate Sample has continued his participation in the Jewish religious rituals even after being\ndenied his request for wine.  (Id. at 90, 94-95).  He describes Mr. Sample as an inmate trying to\npractice his religion. (Id. at 97).  Unbeknownst to Mr. Aiken, however, inmate Sample has not\ncontinued to participate in the Jewish religious rituals.  Inmate Sample now states that it is better\nnot to observe the ritual at all rather than to practice the observance in what he calls the “wrong”\n- 22 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 25 of 53\nway.  (Sample Depo. at 107-108).\nMr. Aiken concedes that in order to adopt a program in prison that would permit the\ndistribution of significant amounts of wine to prisoners, BOP would have to attempt to determine\nif the inmate is sincere in his beliefs.  See Aiken Depo. at 89, 112, 133.  In assessing an inmate’s\nsincerity, Mr. Aiken would consider the inmate’s criminal history, including the inmate’s\nJudgment and Commitment Order, Presentence Investigation Report, and prior convictions.  (Id.\nat 103).  Mr. Aiken would also look at the Court’s recommendations.  (Id. at 61).  When\nassessing the inmate’s sincerity, Mr. Aiken stated that he would also examine the absence of the\nkind of activity that led to the plaintiff’s incarceration, (id. at 104), in this case, fraud.  \nA review of Sample’s Judgment and Commitment Order reflects that the court issued a\nrecommendation for the inmate’s participation in the BOP drug abuse program, which was\ndesigned for inmates with a drug addiction.  The fact that the sentencing judge recommended\ndrug abuse treatment in addition to Sample’s documented history of alcohol and drug use since\nan early age (see Presentence Investigative Report, at ¶¶ 82-84, filed as Exhibit 15 to the Pl.’s\nCross-mot) is significant.  Based on this information, Mr. Sample’s efforts to secure alcohol --\nostensibly for his religious rituals -- is highly suspect.\nSignificantly, Mr. Aiken asserts that criteria to determine whether to accommodate\nreligious rituals must be based on Jewish law, rather than some mere self-proclaimed desire for\nwine.  (Aiken Depo. at 196-98).   In determining how to accommodate an inmate’s religious\npractice, Mr. Aiken asserts that reliance on Jewish leaders in the community is part of the\nprocess. (Id. at 197).  He confirms that having a staff member administer the wine is an\nacceptable way of ensuring a level of control over the wine.  (Id. at 134).  He also accepts that it\n- 23 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 26 of 53\nis important to have someone knowledgeable of the religion present during the ritual. (Id. at 183,\n193).  Yet, Mr. Aiken acknowledges that there are limits to what inmates can have in prison. (Id.\nat 184).  Mr. Aiken also asserts that in order to make accommodations he would also look at the\ngeneral accepted practice in the United States. (Id. at 72). \nIn assessing accommodations for an inmate’s religious practices, the BOP acts in\ncompliance with Mr. Aiken’s suggestions.  See Aiken Depo. at 81-83.  That is, the BOP policy\ntracks Mr. Aiken’s model on this point.  BOP relies on Jewish leaders for information and\nguidance regarding religious accommodations in its prisons.  Jewish texts are also consulted. \nThe BOP policy requires that a clergy person authorized by the BOP be present during the rituals\nwhere wine is dispensed to inmates.  The clergy person is knowledgeable about the rituals and\nrequirements of the religion.  See Program Statement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices\n7B (December 31, 2004) (filed as Exhibit 9 of Pl.’s Cross-mot).  BOP policy limits the amounts\nof wine an inmate can obtain to “small amounts of wine.”  Id.  The BOP has looked at the\ngeneral accepted practice of Judaism in the United States.  Many Jewish individuals consume\ngrape juice or what plaintiff calls a “sip of wine.”  (Sample Depo. at 41-42).  The BOP offered\nMr. Sample grape juice, a mixture of wine and grape juice (one drop of wine to 3 to 5 ounces of\ngrape juice, and diluted wine (1 part of wine to 5 parts of water), which was consistent with the\nsmall amount of wine he might receive in the community.  In the community, he would have\ngotten a sip of wine and that would be acceptable to him.  (Id. at 42).  In prison, however, Mr.\nSample wants 3 to 5 ounces of wine, more than he would normally receive in the community\nthereby clearly reflecting the “child in a candy store effect” described by the defendants’ security\nexpert.  \n- 24 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 27 of 53\nEven Plaintiff’s security expert agrees that a prisoner’s claims of conversations with God\nare not a reliable source of religious beliefs and practices.  Mr. Aiken asserts that an inmate\ncannot do whatever he wants just because he says he had conversations with God.  See Aiken\nDepo. at 80, 107-109, 113-17, 119-20, 133, 135.  He also asserts that an inmate statement that his\nbeliefs are based on his conversations with God “does not serve as a foundation for [inmate]\nbeing sincere.”  (Id. at 116).  Plaintiff’s expert would, in fact, be suspicious of something as\nunverifiable as an inmate’s assertion that the source of his beliefs are conversations with God.\n(Id. at 25 and 109).  Mr. Aiken recognizes that in prison inmates lie to get benefits, (id. at 120),\nand specifically that inmates lie about the religious nature of their desire in order to get better\nfood or food they like better. (Id. at 141).  Indeed, Plaintiff himself has observed this to apply to\napproximately half of the prisoners on the religious food diet.  Sample Depo. at 69.\nMr. Aiken supports the establishment of criteria to determine the accommodations an\ninmate would receive for his religious rituals.  He states that criteria must not be based on an\ninmate’s assertion that he had conversations with God (Aiken Depo. at 196), but instead it should\nbe based on Jewish law.   The following exchange reflects his opinion:\nQ. And the criteria is going to be based upon Jewish law, right?\nA.   Based on Jewish law as well as how it is in relationship to operational practice.\nQ. But it’s not going to be dictated by the inmate saying “God told me I must have\nsomething”?\nA. Of course.\nQ. It really will not?\nA. If an inmate comes to me and says “God told me to get 12 ounces,” you’re not\ngoing to get it.\n- 25 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 28 of 53\nQ.  Okay.  And you would think that would be appropriate under Bureau of Prisons’\npolicy?\nA. Yes, sir.\nAiken Depo. at 196. \nPlaintiff, himself, has admitted that the basis for his claim to require wine, rather than any\nof the substitutes permitted by the Code of Jewish Law and by Rabbis he has consulted, is\nfounded only on his, obviously uncorroborated, conversations with God.  Sample Depo. at 31-35;\nsee also id. at 107-08.  Thus, the uncontested facts would not support the provision of wine to\nMr. Sample, even if he could establish a sincerely held religious belief in the need for wine to\npractice his religion.  Rather, the self-proclaimed religious need for wine by an inmate who has\npreviously been required to undergo Alcoholics Anonymous, who has been recommended for\ndrug abuse treatment, who admittedly enjoys alcohol and who has fraudulently sought to secure a\nprescription drug (codeine) in the past (Sample Depo. at 31-39, 58-59), cannot reasonably\nsupport the provision of significant amounts of wine in the prison setting in the face of the\nserious security concerns that it would pose.  (See Aiken Depo. at 68-69, 81, 107-09, 112-17,\n119-22, 132-35, 138-39).\nB. Defendant’s Security Expert Also Establishes that Wine in Other than Small\nAmounts Presents a Serious Threat to the Secure and Orderly Running of Prisons.\nDavid Rardin who worked in federal prisons for 28 years states that BOP policy is\ngrounded on safety and security.  (Rardin Depo. at 31).  The accommodation of plaintiff’s\nrequest for wine presents a security problem even if its use were limited to Texarkana Camp. (Id.\nat 36).  Courts consider whether there is a compelling governmental interest to apply the\nregulation to the individual plaintiff.  Kikimura v. Harley, 242 F.3d 950, 962 (10th Cir. 2001). \n- 26 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 29 of 53\nThere are security concerns related to Sample’s own ability to conform and to control his\nimpulses when he is under the influence of alcohol. (Id. at 38).  He is requesting substantial\namounts of wine. (Id. at 39).  Just as RFRA recognizes the standard “should be interpreted with\nregard to the relevant circumstances in each case,” Mr. Rardin makes an important distinction in\nthe allowance of wine in prison when he explains that “[t]he appropriateness of allowing\nconsiderable amounts of wine (3 to 5 ounces) is relative to location.  While in the community 3\nto 5 ounces is not much, in the prison setting 3 to 5 ounces on Friday nights and Saturday\nmornings is a substantial amount.”  (Rardin Report, ¶ 8.3).  \n  While there are serious concerns related to the plaintiff himself as outlined above, in a\ncorrectional environment, it is impossible to make security-based decisions in isolation, rather\nBOP must deal with the entire organization (Id. at 66) because, among other factors, what is\napproved for Mr. Sample, will ultimately be approved for thousands of inmates in BOP custody. \n(Id. at 36).10  See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 90 (1987)(“In the necessarily closed environment\nof the correctional institution, few changes will have no ramifications on the liberty of others or\non the use of the prison’s limited resources for preserving institutional order.  When\naccommodation of an asserted right will have a significant ‘ripple effect’ on fellow inmates or on\nprison staff, courts should be particularly deferential to the informed decision of corrections\nofficials.”)  \n1. The Accommodation of Plaintiff’s Request would Require a Great Deal of\nResources.\nMr. Rardin explains that accommodating Plaintiff’s request would have a major impact\n10  Indeed, Mr. Sample recognizes that other inmates would try to get alcohol even if they\ndo not have a religious reason for doing so.  Sample Depo. at 61-62.\n- 27 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 30 of 53\non prison operations.  He explains,\nTo give inmates substantial amounts of wine touches on every important aspect of prison\nlife.  Currently, the BOP has more than 3000 Jewish inmates incarcerated in one hundred\nand fourteen institutions throughout the federal system.  To allow considerable amounts\nof wine would mean to have large amounts of wine in institutions with large\nconcentrations of Jewish inmates.  This would present a serious security threat.  Large\namounts of resources would have to be expended to safely store and distribute the large\namounts of wine needed for the rituals and protect the religious practice from abuse. \nMoreover, the BOP would need to make major adjustments, including but not limited to\nthe following: (1) develop and implement further correctional procedures to cover the\nacquisition, distribution, and secure storage of large amounts of wine; (2) major\nreallocation of staff resources since the wine would be offered on Fridays and Saturdays\nwhen the institutions already have fewer staff available; (3) provide greater supervision to\nguard the wine; and (4) provide intensive11 training for all staff.  \n(Rardin Report, ¶ 8.4).  With approximately 3,000 inmates who identify themselves as Jewish\ndispersed among the different institutions, the amount of wine that would have to be purchased,\nstored, and dispensed every week in institutions with high concentrations of Jewish inmates\npresents a challenge.  Once you multiply the three to five ounces of wine for the two or possibly\nthree weekly rituals for hundreds, if not thousands, of inmates, the cost of the wine to the BOP is\nexorbitant.  In addition, the expenses related to the supervision and accommodation of the rituals\nis significant. (Rardin Depo. at 47-48).  \n2. It Is Not Feasible for the BOP to Test \nan Inmate’s Sincerity in his Religious Beliefs\nThe BOP has no way to test the sincerity of an inmate’s beliefs.  (Rardin Depo. at 53). \nForty percent of inmates who come into custody were under the influence of alcohol when\ncommitting the crimes for which they are convicted.  (Id. at 59).  Thus, at least forty percent of\n11All BOP staff is required to participate in Annual Refresher Training every year and\nreceives training on religious matters. Chaplaincy Services staff receive intensive training and are\nthe subject matter experts in religious matters within the BOP.\n- 28 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 31 of 53\nthe inmate population has an alcohol problem.  It is highly predictable that inmates will change\ntheir religious preference in order to obtain wine.  See Sample Depo. at 61-62.  This is a major\nchallenge to prison administrators.  \nTesting the inmates’ religious sincerity is not workable in the prison setting because,\n... there are serious obstacles to the BOP design of a test to measure the ‘sincere beliefs’\nof inmates.  The different gradations of faith or spirituality in the test administrators may\naffect their judgment about the religious beliefs of inmates.  The BOP should not get\ninvolved in determining ‘how committed are inmates to their faith.’  The BOP, however,\nis committed to providing inmates of all religious affiliations with reasonable and\nequitable opportunities to practice their beliefs, within the confines of the security of the\ninstitution and availability of resources.\nRardin Report, ¶¶ 7-8; see also Sample Depo. at 69 (estimating that half of the prisoners\nparticipating in the religious diet program do so for reasons other than religion).  BOP policy\ndoes not encourage or discourage inmates from changing their religious affiliations because it is\nnot in the government’s interest to be involved in the inmates’ declaration of faith.  (Rardin\nDepo. at 63).  But, testing the sincerity of the inmate is not something that the BOP can\neffectively accomplish.  Id.\n3.   Empowerment of an Inmate is not \n     Appropriate in the Prison Setting\n Wine is valuable and is deemed a currency in prison.  See Rardin Depo. at 48; accord\nSample Depo. at 61-62 (opining that other inmates would likely try to buy wine from Plaintiff). \nMr. Sample would thus empower himself with the use of wine in the amounts he seeks for the\nreligious rituals.  He would be able to manipulate “currency” by showing other inmates how to\nget substantial amounts of wine. (Rardin Depo. at 52).  And, if Mr. Sample does not succumb to\npressure by other inmates, he may suffer retaliation.  (Id. at 49).  It is predictable that he will be\n- 29 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 32 of 53\nvictimized.  (Id. at 50-51).  Acts of retaliation and abuses by inmates upon inmates as well as on\nstaff, have long existed and will continue to exist. (Id. at 116).\nAs the BOP’s has explained:\nFrom the prospective of prison management, when an inmate is able to empower himself\nin a special way and succeeds, he is perceived as a powerful inmate, one with an identity,\nby other inmates and staff.  Not just to protect the government and prevent the use of\nwine in prison, but also from a prison administrator’s point of view, inmates should not\nempower themselves in leadership roles nor should they assume an identity of their own. \nPrison management is grounded on the principle that all inmates are treated and managed\nequally.  In other words, while in prison, inmates do not have any authority or power over\nothers. When an inmate is perceived by others to have power, not only does the inmate\nbecome a threat to the secure operation of the facility, but also becomes a potential target\nfor extortion or coercion from other inmates.  If he is unwilling to succumb to the\npressure due to his status, there is a potential confrontational situation regardless of\nsecurity level. Therefore, putting an inmate in a position of power by acquiescing to his\ndemands is a threat to the management of the institution, the staff, the inmate population,\nand the inmate himself.\n(Rardin Report, ¶ A1). \nC. Defendants Have Established that The Limitations On Wine in \nFederal Prisons Meet the Least Restrictive Means Test Of The RFRA\nBOP has met its burden under the least restrictive means test of RFRA.  To accomplish\nthis task does not mean that prison officials must analyze every conceivable option in order to\nsatisfy this prong of RFRA.  See Hamilton v. Schriro, 74 F.3d 1545, 1556 (8th Cir. 1996), cert.\ndenied 519 U.S. 874 (1996)(“It would be a herculean burden to require prison administrators to\nrefute every conceivable option in order to satisfy the least restrictive means prong of RFRA. \nMoreover, such an onerous requirement would be irreconcilable with the well-established\nprinciple, recognized by the Supreme Court and RFRA’s legislative history, that prison\nadministrators must be accorded due deference in creating regulations and policies directed at the\nmaintenance of prison safety and security.”).  “Prisons are not required to allow inmates to\n- 30 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 33 of 53\nparticipate in any and all activities which the inmate may claim is based upon religious exercise.” \nCrocker v. Durkin, 159 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1278 (D.Kan. 2001) (citing Kikimura v. Harley, 242\nF.3d 950,956 (10th Cir. 2001)).\nPrison administrators examined different alternatives and offered what constituted the\nleast restrictive means in their respective institutions.\n(I) FCI Beaumont Low\nAt the beginning of this litigation, plaintiff was housed at FCI Beaumont Low,8 where he\nwas able to participate in all the rituals of his religion and even enjoyed a “leadership” position in\nthe Jewish community.  He filed his first administrative remedy request regarding the use of wine\nwhile at Beaumont Low.  Plaintiff requested 3.5 ounces of Kosher red wine for Kiddush prayers\non Friday nights and Saturday mornings and 4 glasses of 3.5 ounces of Kosher red wine for\nPassover Seder.  (See Plaintiff’s Administrative Remedy Request and Appeals No. 349743 \nfiled as Attachment A to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (hereinafter “First Remedy Request”)). \nThe Warden explained that “[w]ine has been deemed a security issue at the institution and\ntherefore is not provided to any religious faith for inmate consumption.”  Id.  Therefore, the\nWarden offered plaintiff the use of grape juice as a substitute for the wine.  In so doing, the\nWarden consulted with the religious staff who confirmed that the use of grape juice was an\naccepted practice within the Jewish community.  Jewish Law itself, upon which the BOP relies\nand which Plaintiff contends he follows (Pl.’s Compl. ¶ 9), provides grape juice as an alternative\nto celebrate the Kuddish and Passover Seder when wine is not available.  See Handbook, at 4-7\nand 6-20, respectively.  (See also Stipulation of Rabbi Goldstein ¶ 4 filed as Exhibit 3 to Pl.’s\n8 Plaintiff was housed at FCI Beaumont from April 8, 2003 through January 10, 2006.\n- 31 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 34 of 53\nCross-mot).  \n(ii) FCI Jesup Camp\nSubsequently, Plaintiff was moved to FCI Jesup-Camp.9  While at Jesup Camp, he sent an\nInmate Request to Staff Member dated April 13, 2006, addressed to the Warden.  See Exhibit 5. \nAt Jesup, he requested 3 to 5 ounces of red wine for Kiddush on Friday evenings and Saturday\nmorning and four glasses of 3 to 5 ounces for the Passover Seders.  See id.  After examining the\ninmate’s request in light of the security of the institution, the Warden offered plaintiff\nnonalcoholic wine for both the Sabbath Services and the Passover Seders.  See id.  Plaintiff\nrefused the non-alcoholic wine because it appeared he wanted it to be Kosher and the warden\nsought clarification about what plaintiff was seeking.  See Inmate Request to Staff Member dated\nApril 17, 2006, filed as Attachment 5 to the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss As Moot, Or In The\nAlternative, To Reconsider Grant Of Partial Summary Judgment For Plaintiff And To Transfer\nAnd Opposition To The Plaintiff’s Motion For Reconsideration (“Def.’s Br.”).  Plaintiff clarified\nhe wanted Kosher red wine.  See Inmate Requests to Staff Member dated April 20, 2006, May 1,\n2006 and May 9, 2006 filed as Exhibits A, B and C to the Pl.’s Opp’n.  The Warden neither\ndenied nor granted his requests for the kosher alcoholic red wine, but gave the inmate the choice\nto await his response or to file an administrative remedy request since the Plaintiff’s request was\nstill under evaluation in light of the security concerns at Jesup.  See Inmate Request to Staff and\nWarden’s response, Exhibit C to Pl.’s Opp’n. \nPlaintiff filed an administrative remedy request, No.  414949-F1, dated May 22, 2006, in\n9 Plaintiff was housed at the FCI Jesup Camp from February 10, 2006, through October\n15, 2007.\n- 32 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 35 of 53\nwhich he repeated his request to the warden.  See Admin. Rem. Req. and Appeals No. 414949. \nThe Warden explained that his request was still being assessed in light of the security of the\ninstitution and neither denied nor granted his request.  Plaintiff filed a Regional Administrative\nRemedy Appeal and the Regional Director responded that “[t]he Warden at Jesup has decided to\npartially grant your request by offering you a blend of a small amount of kosher red wine (one\ndrop) and three to five ounces of kosher grape juice for your religious rituals.  I concur with the\nWarden’s determination.”  Id.; see also Vazquez Depo. at 147 (“Going by what the program\nstatement says, we found the least restrictive means to accommodate the inmate which is one\ndrop [of wine] in three ounces of grape juice.”).  Plaintiff also rejected this option and appealed\nto the Central Office.  Central Office concurred with the Warden and the Regional Director and\noffered plaintiff the same blend of kosher grape juice with one drop of kosher red wine.  See id.\n(iii.) FCI Texarkana Camp\nPlaintiff was transferred to FCI Texarkana Camp on October 15, 2007, where he filed an\nadministrative remedy request, dated December 3, 2007.  Plaintiff requested 3 to 5 ounces of\nKosher red wine for the Sabbath rituals on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings, and then\nadded, the same amount of wine for Saturday evenings also.  He also requests four cups of 3 to 5\nounces of kosher red wine during the two Passover Seders.  See Admin. Rem. Req. and Appeals\nNo. 475362.  The Warden at Texarkana made the following offer to the plaintiff, \n[c]onsistent with your asserted religious needs and the facility’s duty to maintain security\nand good order, it has been determined to allow you to receive kosher grape juice, three\nounces of kosher grape juice with a drop of low alcohol kosher wine; or a three-ounce\nmixture of a low-alcohol kosher wine and water, approximately one part wine and five\nparts water.  If you desire the three-ounce water and wine mixture, the above grape juice\noptions would be available for the other three glasses requested for the Passover Seders.  \n- 33 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 36 of 53\nSee id.  This decision was upheld at both the regional and the central office levels.   \nPlaintiff would not accept other alternatives based on the Code of Jewish Law.  The Code\nof Jewish Law provides alternatives to wine to observe the rituals such as grape juice, raisin\nwine, boiled wine, and bread alone. (Sample Depo. at 32-34).  Plaintiff has asserted that these\nother alternatives are not acceptable to him. \nThe use of grape juice is acceptable under the Code of Jewish Law for the saying of\nKiddush and Passover Seder.  See Goldstein’s Stip., ¶¶ 4 and 8.  Plaintiff asserts that he talked to\ntwo Rabbis, who indicated that grape juice was an acceptable alternative.  (Sample Depo. at 34-\n35).  He also asserts that no Rabbi has ever told him that grape juice is unacceptable.  (Id. at 35). \nHowever, Plaintiff disagrees with the Rabbis and rejects grape juice as an alternative. (Id. at 31-\n32).  \nHe asserts that raisin wine is not acceptable either. (Id.  at 32-33).  Plaintiff rejects boiled\nwine (id. at 33); and he has never discussed the raisin wine with a Rabbi. (Id. at 34). Plaintiff\nrecognizes that wine is used during Jewish religious rituals if wine is available.  (See Plaintiff’s\nReply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment at 5-6 (December 21, 2005)).  Wine,\nhowever, is not available in prison.  Thus, the Jewish religion envisions situations in which the\nwine is not available.  In those situations, the ritual can still be observed and the prayers can be\nsaid over bread instead.  (Goldstein Stip., ¶ 5).  However, Plaintiff also rejects praying over bread\nalone. \nPlaintiff’s “all or nothing” posture and escalating requests for wine undermine the\nsincerity of his position and actually bolsters the restriction on the amount of wine espoused by\nBOP policy.  Security in a prison is not automatic simply because there are correctional staff. \n- 34 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 37 of 53\nThere also have to be controls in place, policies that govern inmate behavior and set limitations\non the kinds of activities in which inmates can engage.  Statements of prison administrators,\nincluding plaintiff’s own security expert, bolster the justifications for the BOP to control the\namounts of and the use of wine in prison.  The alternatives offered to plaintiff further the\ngovernment interest in preserving security in the nation’s prisons.  \nPlaintiff does not live in isolation; he lives in a prison system with thousands of inmates. \nWhatever accommodations are done for him, in time, will have to be extended to all Jewish\ninmates.  This will no doubt have consequences for the rest of the institutions and inmate\npopulation. (See Rardin’s Report, ¶¶ 8.4-8.6).\nIf Plaintiff’s request were accommodated, the BOP’s limited resources which have been\nsubject to even more reductions as a result of the war effort “would be stretched beyond their\nability to effectively manage the facility.”  (Rardin Depo. at 62-63).  Accommodating Plaintiff’s\npractice would have a definite impact on the BOP’s ability to accommodate the religious\npractices of the rest of the inmate population as resources allocated for that purpose would be\ndepleted.  It is undeniable that an alternative means cannot be deemed as the least restrictive if “if\nit places additional burdens on other believers.”  Hamilton, supra, at 1556.  To find otherwise\nwould be a very dangerous proposition.\nOne court explained that in order “[t]o meet the least restrictive means prison\nadministrators generally ought to explore at least some alternatives, and their rejection should\ngenerally be accompanied by some measure of explanation.”  Spratt v. Rhode Island Dept. Of\n- 35 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 38 of 53\nCorrections, 482 F.3d 33, 21 fn.11 (1st Cir. 2007).10  It is extremely difficult for prison\nadministrators to evaluate and accommodate individual requests for special treatment under\nRFRA while maintaining the integrity of their policy.  “The most effective and fair means of\napplying prison regulations is across the board to avoid resentment . . .” among inmates.  Blanken\nv. Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, 944 F.Supp. 1359, 1368 (S.D. Ohio 1996). \nThe BOP has justified the alternative means offered to Plaintiff based on the security of the\ninstitution as explained in the discussion on the government’s compelling interest in controlling\nwine consumption even if for religious purposes.  First, BOP has carefully examined Plaintiff’s\nrequest in light of the prison’s security concerns.  Second, Plaintiff refused any of the alternatives\noffered to him as he continued insisting on getting the substantial amounts of wine he seeks for\nthe rituals and in fact, at least administratively, he has increased the amounts of wine he seeks on\nseveral occasions.  Third, the BOP does not have the resources to make the kind of\naccommodation for wine that Plaintiff seeks.\n10 Although Spratt was a case decided under RLUIPA, RFRA and RLUIPA apply\nessentially the same standards.

Plaintiff was convicted of a misdemeanor for attempting to obtain by fraud a\nprescription for codeine which he wanted for resale.  See Deposition Transcript of Brandon\nSample (“Sample Depo.”) (Exhibit 3) at 39.\n2.  Plaintiff was the mastermind of a conspiracy to commit money laundering, abetting\nthe possession of counterfeit security and aiding and abetting the possession of stolen mail matter\n(Sample Depo. at 52; Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis.

In 2002, the BOP amended its policy to provide inmates may receive “small \namounts of wine” as part of a religious ritual. See Program Statement 5360.08, Religious \nBeliefs and Practices (August 22, 2002) attached as Attachment C to Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss.\n5.  The Bureau of Prisons’ administrative remedy database reflects that while at Beaumont\nLow Plaintiff filed an Administrative Remedy Request # 349793, in which he requested at least\n3.5 ounces of wine every Friday and Saturday for the Kuddish prayer and at least 3.5 ounces of\nwine four times during the Passover Seder, a request that was denied and which Plaintiff appealed\nto the Regional Director and then to the Central Office, where his appeal was also denied.  The\nadministrative remedy responses explained that the restriction on wine consumption for inmates is\nbased on the need to maintain the secure and orderly running of the institution and the institution\nis utilizing Kosher grape juice as it is an acceptable substitute for wine according to Jewish law as\nconfirmed by the Rabbi. See Administrative Remedy Request and Appeals 349793 as Attachment\nA to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.\n6.   In his complaint, plaintiff stated that he “believes that he must drink at least 3.5 oz of\nred wine while saying Kiddush . . . during Friday night and Saturday shabbos services.” \n(Complaint, ¶ 9).  \n7.  Plaintiff also stated that “he must drink four cups containing at least 3.5 ounces of wine\nduring the Passover seder.”  (Id., ¶ 10).  \n8.  Plaintiff proclaimed this belief was dictated by “Jewish sages, the Code of Jewish Law,\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 42 of 53\nand by practice.”  Id. \n9.  Plaintiff has claimed to be “an observant Jew [who] practiced Judaism before his\nincarceration  . . .” (Id., ¶ 8).  “For example, before his incarceration, plaintiff said Kiddush over\nwine during his Friday night and Saturday morning shabbos services.”  Id.\n10.  Plaintiff contends that “he continue[d] his practice of Judaism while confined”\nfrequently attending Jewish services and events. Id.\n11.  Plaintiff was the Jewish faith group representative while housed Beaumont Low. See\nPlaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 23 attached to Plaintiff’s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and Response\nto Motion to Dismiss (“Plaintiff’s Cross-Mot”). \n12.  Prior to incarceration on or about June 12, 2000, Plaintiff attended the Congregation\nof Beth Yeshurun 2 or 3 times between 1998 and 2000.  See Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses,\nAdmis. Nos.14-15; Declaration of Bruce Plumley (“Plumley Decl.”)(Exhibit 4), ¶ 3.\n13.  Prior to incarceration, plaintiff participated in Kiddush no more than two or three\ntimes (Sample Depo. at 46), on those occasions he used red wine (id. at 47), and during the ritual\nhe was the only person present. Id. at 101.\n14.  Plaintiff celebrated the ritual of Passover Seder at his home one or two times between\n1998-2000, and he celebrated it according to his “own knowledge and understanding of how\nthings work.”  Id. at 99; see also Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No.7.  \n15.  In 2000, Plaintiff did not partake in any observances and in 2001, he participated in an\noccasional Sabbath during the Summer months. (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. No. 17).  \n16.  Plaintiff admits to being a social drinker.  (Sample Depo. at  110-111).\n17.  Plaintiff filed his first administrative remedy request regarding a religious\n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 43 of 53\naccommodation on September 14, 2001.  See Plumley Decl., ¶ 5.  \n18.  Plaintiff enrolled in the religious diet in 2002.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses,\nAdmis. No. 19).\n19.   Plaintiff filed his first administrative remedy request for wine on August 31, 2004,\nmore than four years after being in custody; and BOP records reflect that prior to August 31, 2004,\nhe had filed a total of one hundred and twenty eight administrative remedy requests.  (Plumley\nDecl., ¶ 8).\n20.  Plaintiff changed the initial amount of wine (3.5 ounces, according to the Complaint)\nand now seeks to 3 to 5 ounces of wine for each ritual. See Pl.’s Cross-mot. at 3-4 and Plaintiff’s\nDecl., ¶ 2 (“It is my sincerely held religious belief that I must consume between 3 to 5 ounces of\nwine every Friday and Saturday during the saying of Kiddush . . . . and 3 to 5 ounces of wine four\ntimes during the Pesach . . . Seder.”). \n21.  Plaintiff changed his belief to 3 to 5 ounces of wine during the Passover Seders,\nincreasing the rituals to two Seders.  (See Inmate Request to Staff Member, April 13, 2006\nattached as Exhibit 5; see also Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Inter. No. 11).  \n22.  Upon Plaintiff’s arrival at FCI Jesup, he stated he participated in all the Jewish\nreligious rituals.  Plaintiff was an inmate representative for the other Jewish inmates.  (Deposition\nTranscript of Chaplain Raymond Ortiz, 97:15-22, January 3, 2008, attached as Exhibit 8).  \n23.  Plaintiff filed an Inmate Request to Staff Member requesting wine, and the warden\noffered him nonalcoholic wine, which Plaintiff refused.   Plaintiff then filed an Administrative\n- 4 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 44 of 53\nRequest and Appeal for wine, whereupon the Warden offered him one drop of wine in 3 to 5\nounces of grape juice, an offer concurred with by the Regional Director and Central Office.  (See\nAdministrative Remedy Request and Appeals 414949, attached as Exhibit 13).\n24.  Plaintiff arrived in Texarkana in 2007, and filed a new Administrative Remedy\nRequest and Appeals for wine, following which the Warden offered Plaintiff the following\nalternatives: kosher grape juice; three ounces of kosher grape juice with a drop of low-alcohol\nkosher wine; or a three-ounce mixture of a low-alcohol kosher wine and water, approximately one\npart wine and five parts water.  If plaintiff desired the three-ounce water and wine mixture, the\nabove grape juice options would be available for the other three glasses requested for the Passover\nSeders.  Plaintiff rejected these offers also.  See Administrative Remedy Request and Appeals\n#475362 attached as Exhibit 6.\n25.  In December of 2007, plaintiff asserted that he had continued to participate in the\nJewish rituals in spite of the denial of the wine.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 26)\n(Exhibit 2). \n26.  In February of 2008, plaintiff stated he was no longer saying kiddush while at\nTexarkana because he does not have wine and does not want to say it with grape juice or bread.\n(Sample Depo. at 78).  \n27.  Plaintiff said that it is better not to participate in the rituals than to do it wrong.  (Id. at\n107-08).\n28.  Plaintiff explained that he participated in the rituals, not because of his “sincerely held\nbelief”, but out of respect to other Jewish inmates and their beliefs.  (Pl.’s Dep. 0079:4-12). \n29.  Plaintiff stated that, although other alternatives to wine were available to him\n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 45 of 53\naccording to the Code of Jewish Law and according to Rabbis, God spoke to him about stopping\nhis participation in the rituals (Sample Depo. at 78), and  this is the reason why he has not\nparticipated in any rituals since his arrival at Texarkana.  (Id. at 80).\n30.  According to Plaintiff, the source of his beliefs in the need for wine are his twenty or\nso conversations with God.  (Id. at 31-33). \n31.  Regarding an inmate’s assertion that his purported need for wine is based on\nconversations with God, James Aiken, the Plaintiff’s own expert on prison security, has indicated\nthat he would question any inmate whose purported religious need for wine was based on claimed\ndiscussions with God: “[a]nd certainly in this case, if that was said to me, to which it wasn’t, you\nknow, that would cause negative -- more of a negative than a positive.”  See Deposition Transcript\nof James Aiken (“Aiken Depo.“) (Exhibit 9) at 107-08.  \n32.  Mr. Aiken further explains that if an inmate told him, “. . . ‘God talked to me last\nnight,’ and I won’t doubt that, ‘And he says that I can have a bottle of wine in my cell to drink\nwhenever I feel like it,’ I’m not going to grant that.”  (Aiken Depo. at 21-24).  \n33.  Indeed, Mr. Aiken asserts he would be suspicious of something as unverifiable as the\nassertion of having conversations with God to justify a request for wine in prison.  (Aiken Depo.\nat 107-09). \n34.  Plaintiff claims to follow the teachings of Jewish sages (also referred to as Rabbis)\nand the Code of Jewish Law, but he follows his own interpretation of Judaism regardless of what\nthe Rabbis say or the Code of Jewish Law states regarding any substitutions for wine in the Jewish\nreligious rituals.  See Sample Depo. at 18-19; 34-35.  \n35.  Indeed, Plaintiff has stated he would not accept what a Rabbi tells him. (Id.).  \n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 46 of 53\n36.  James Aiken is not an expert in Jewish matters, but recognizes the need to assess\nprisoner’s requests only in light of the dictates of the Jewish religious leaders, rather than any self-\nserving statements of what the prisoner says God told him.  See Aiken Depo. at 68-69, 89, 137-38.\n36.  It is an acceptable practice in the community, that while the person presiding over the\nrituals drinks the wine, others would just drink a sip of wine.  (Sample Depo. at 41-42).  \n37.  Plaintiff asserts that if he had some interaction with the Rabbi or staff presiding over\nthe ritual and knew they were Jewish and sincere, it would be acceptable to him that the Rabbi or\nstaff consume the wine on his behalf. (Id. at 44-45). \n38.  The Code of Jewish Law does not require that the participant know the person\npresiding the ritual. (Id. 43).  \n39.  Plaintiff did not know the Rabbi in the synagogue he attended while in the community\nand who presided over the rituals.  (Id. at 44).\n40.  Plaintiff states that although he has never participated in the ritual of havdalah, he\nnow “believes” in getting 3-5 ounces of wine at the institutional level for this ritual in addition to\nthe other weekly Sabbath Observances.  (Sample Depo. at 88-89; see also Administrative Remedy\nRequest 475362-F1).  \n41.  Plaintiff readily admits that in the past, he has misrepresented facts to obtain benefits.\n(Sample Depo. at 51).  \n42.  Plaintiff previously represented himself as a Baptist University student to obtain a\ncredit card.  (Id. at 50-51).  \n43.  Plaintiff provided a “materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that\nsignificantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation [of the crime he was charged with].”\n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 47 of 53\n(Presentence Investigative Report, ¶48 attached as Exhibit 15 to the Plaintiff’s Cross-Mot.). \n44.  Plaintiff seeks to participate in the BOP drug treatment program (Sample Depo. at 38),\neven though he states he does not have a substance abuse program and does not need treatment. \n(Id. at 60). \n45.  The BOP drug abuse treatment program was designed for non-violent offenders who\nare “determined to have a substance abuse problem,” (Program Statement 5330.10, Drug Abuse\nPrograms Manual, Chapter 6, at 1 (June 26, 1995) , attached as Exhibit 10).\n46.  Jewish inmates can enroll in the religious diet, a religious diet which consists of more\nvegetables and fruits, which is  perceived by inmates as a healthier diet.  (Ortiz Depo. at 62-63). \n47.  Judaism is also the religion with the most days of work proscription, a total of 13 days\nin a year.  (See Chaplaincy Services Guidance for the Recognition of Holy Days Calling for Work\nProscription and Public Fast Days, attached as Exhibit 12).\n48.  Judaism does not require a particular percentage of alcohol for the celebration of the\nrituals. (Sample Depo. at 66 and Sample Depo. Exh. 5). \n49.  Plaintiff has consumed intoxicants and has used codeine (id. at 39:11-21), marijuana\nand cocaine since a young age. (See Presentence Report, ¶ 82-83).  \n50.  Plaintiff also consumed wine and beer since age 15. (Id. , ¶ 82).\n51.  Plaintiff asserts that he participated in the rituals of his religion for most of his\nincarceration in spite of not having wine.  (See Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 21; see also Plaintiff’s\nDiscovery Responses, Admis. No. 26). \n52.  Plaintiff’s attitudes toward Judaism have not been affected by the denial of the wine. \n(Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 24). \n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 48 of 53\n53.  The practice of Judaism allows for the use of wine if wine is available.  (Plaintiff’s\nReply in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, at 5-6 (December 21, 2005)).\n54.  The BOP has accommodated many of the plaintiff’s request for religious\naccommodations.  (Sample Depo. at 28-29). \n55.  BOP has not denied plaintiff any benefits because of his desire to seek wine for his\nreligious rituals.  (Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses, Admis. No. 28).   \n56.  Plaintiff had an altercation with his cell mate over plaintiff’s refusal to assist his cell\nmate with a legal issue.  (Sample Depo. at 63).  \n57.  Allowing substantial amounts of wine in prison creates a security concern (Aiken\nDepo. at 24-25); and not all circumstances are safe to give an inmate the amount of wine he\nwants. (Id. at 113).  \n58.  BOP must control the amount of wine inmates receive.  (Id. at 112).\n59.  Alcohol consumption has to be controlled in prison.  (Id. at 80).\n60.  Inmates are more disruptive and potentially violent inmates when using alcohol. (Id. at\n9).\n61.  Even in a well operated facility, there are no guarantees that inmates will not commit\nviolent actions.  (Id. at 161).\n62.  Criteria to determine whether to accommodate religious rituals must be based on the\nlaw of the religion.  (Id. at 196). \n63.  Reliance on religious leaders in the community is part of the process of assessing\nwhether to accommodate a religious practice in prison. (Id. at 197).\n64.  It is important to have someone knowledgeable of the religion present during the\n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 49 of 53\nritual. (Id. at 183, 193).  \n65.  In order to accommodate a religious practice, prison administrators should look at the\ngeneral accepted practice in the United States. (Id. at 72). \n66.  An inmate’s statement that his beliefs are based on his conversations with God “does\nnot serve as a foundation for [the inmate] being sincere.”  (Id. at 116). \n67.  In prison, inmates lie to get benefits. (Id. at 120).\n68.  Inmates lie about the religious nature of their desire in order to get better food or food\nthey like better. (Id. at 141; see also Sample Depo. at 69). \n69.  BOP policy is grounded on safety and security.  (Deposition Transcript of David\nRardin at 31).\n70.  The provision of wine to plaintiff in the amounts he seeks would present a security\nproblem even if its use were limited to Texarkana Camp. (Rardin Depo. at 36). \n71.  There are security concerns related to Plaintiff’s own ability to conform and to control\nhis impulses when he is under the influence of alcohol. (Rardin Depo. at 38). \n  72.  In the prison setting 3 to 5 ounces of wine on Friday nights and Saturday mornings is a\nsubstantial amount. (Revised Expert Report of David Rardin, ¶  8.3).\n73.  In a correctional environment, it is impossible to make assessments relating to security\nbased on an isolated inmate; rather, prison administrators have to deal with the entire organization\n(Rardin Depo. at 66) because, among other factors, what is approved for one inmate, will\nultimately be approved for thousands of inmates in the BOP custody.  (Id. at 36). \n74.  To give inmates substantial amounts of wine touches on every important aspect of\nprison life.  (Rardin Report, ¶ 8.4). \n- 10 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 50 of 53\n75.  With approximately 3,000 inmates who identify themselves as Jewish dispersed\namong the different institutions, the amount of wine that would have to be purchased, stored, and\ndispensed every week in institutions with high concentrations of Jewish inmates presents a\nchallenge.  (Id.)  \n76.  Once the three to five ounces of wine for the two or possibly three weekly rituals is\nmultiplied by the hundreds, if not thousands, of inmates, the cost of the wine to the BOP is\nexorbitant. (Id.)\n77.  The BOP has no effective method to test the sincerity of an inmate’s religious beliefs. \n(Rardin Depo. at 53; see also Plaintiff’s Depo. at 69).  \n78.  Forty percent of inmates who come into custody were under the influence of alcohol\nwhen committing the crimes for which they are convicted.  (Rardin Depo. at 59).  \n79.   There is a significant difference between the use of tobacco and wine in religious\nrituals; tobacco is not an intoxicant. (Id. at 78). \n80.  There is nothing intoxicating about a job or the different jobs that may be desirable in\nprison (id. at 80); all inmates are required to work or they would be subject to punishment.  (Id. at\n80).  \n81.  There is nothing intoxicating about intramural games or acting as a referee; such\ngames and sports activities are supervised by the recreation specialist.  (Id. at 106-07).\n81.  Dispensation of medication is very staff intensive and certain steps must be followed:\nthe doctor’s medical evaluation of a health condition which requires medication (id. at 64-66); a\nlicense pharmacist filling the prescription; and either the pharmacist or a nurse dispensing the\nmedication to the inmate and observing the inmate swallow the medication.  (Id.)  Inmates are\n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 51 of 53\nasked to stand in a line and medical staff will dispense medication and observe medication intake\none inmate at a time.  Correctional staff will monitor inmates after taking their medications.  (Id.\nat 66). \n82.  Medications are used to control conditions that have been diagnosed with the use of\nobjective criteria; for instance, psychotropic medications are used to calm inmates down and not\nto make them lose their inhibitions such as alcohol does. (Id. at 81).\n83.  In order to control abuse, a certain number of controlled substances are administered\nby injections.  Rardin Depo. at 117; Deposition Transcript of Pharmacist Mark Rayburn at 27-28\n(Exhibit 14). \n84.  BOP allows inmates the use of certain tools to perform their jobs, but classifies the\ntools and the inmates who use the tools, conducting threat assessments on the tool and the inmate\nbased on his past behavior.  See Rardin Depo. at 125 (Exhibit 11). \n85.  The BOP “ha[s] no ability to classify” [wine for religious consumption].  Id.\n86.  The BOP has the same concerns about drunken disruptive inmates at a camp that it\nhas at a high security institution.  (Id. at 35).\n87.  Regardless of the security level of the institution, the security problem lies with the\nperson being incarcerated and what has to occur with the management of that wine; whether the\ninstitution is a high security facility or a minimum security it matters not.  (Id. at 109). \n  88.  In the restrictive prison environment, Plaintiff wants to know the sincerity of the\nperson praying the kiddush; however, in the community, he did not even know the Rabbi in the \n- 12 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00596-PLF     Document 60      Filed 06/09/2008     Page 52 of 53\nsynagogue he attended.  (Sample Depo. at 44).  \n89.  The Code of Jewish Law does not require that the participant know the person\npresiding the ritual. (Id. at 43). \nRespectfully submitted,             \n                                                                                                \nJEFFREY A.
