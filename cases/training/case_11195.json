    "summary": "<p>On May 6, 2004, nineteen indigent criminal defendants with cases pending in Hampden County, Massachusetts, filed a lawsuit in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, pursuant to state law, claiming that they didn't have attorneys due to a shortage of lawyers in the Hampden County bar advocates program.  The shortage was caused by the low rate of attorney compensation authorized by the state budget.  The petitioners alleged that due to the underfunding, there were no longer a sufficient number of private attorneys willing to accept assignment of petitioners' cases.  Petitioners asked the court to exercise its statutory or inherent powers of superintendence, as well as seeking a declaration that the trial judges could order that assigned counsel be compensated at a higher rate.  Petitioners were represented by lawyers from the ACLU of Massachusetts, the Committee for Public Counsel Services, and private firms.</p><p>On July 28, 2004 the court (Spina, J.) concluded that inadequate compensation of counsel amounted to a deprivation of the constitutional right to counsel.  The court ruled that no defendant entitled to a court-appointed attorney should be required to wait longer than forty-five days for an attorney to file an appearance.  If such appearance was not made within forty-five days, the court held, the case against the defendant should be dismissed without prejudice.  An indigent defendant held in lieu of bail or under an order of preventive detention could not be held more than seven days without counsel before the case was to be dismissed without prejudice.  However, the court held that it was inappropriate for the Supreme Judicial Court to order judges to authorize compensation rates above what the legislature had determined is appropriate.  Lavallee v. Justices In Hampden Superior Court, 442 Mass. 228, 812 N.E.2d 895 (2004).</p><p>Next, the case was sent to the Supreme Judicial Court to determine the appropriate mechanism for putting into place the forty-five and seven day deadlines.  Justice Spina apparently held a hearing on the matter on August 6, 2004 vacating the matter of one of the indigent defendants and remanding the matters of the others to determine whether to impose probationary conditions or to simply release the defendant.  On August 17, 2004 Justice Spina made an interim order allowing judges in arraignment sessions to assign counsel from lists created with the Regional Administrative Justice for the Superior Court for the western region and to compensate them as per the rates approved by the legislature.</p><p>The case is apparently closed. </p>",

Schwab for Boston Bar Association.\nSPINA, J.\nThe petitioners are indigent criminal defendants who have no attorneys to represent them due to a shortage of\n[4]\nlawyers in the Hampden County bar advocates program.  That shortage has been caused by the low rate of\nattorney compensation authorized by the annual budget appropriation. For fiscal year (FY) 2004 the authorized\n230 rates for private counsel were thirty dollars an hour for a District Court case, thirty-nine dollars an *230 hour for a\nSuperior Court case other than a homicide case, and fifty-four dollars an hour for a homicide case. See St. 2003,\n[5]\nc. 26, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX.  Since 1986 there has been little change in these rates, which are among the\nlowest in the nation. See The Spangenberg Group, Rates of Compensation for Court-Appointed Counsel in Non-\nCapital Felonies at Trial: A State-by-State Overview (July 2002). The Committee for Public Counsel Services\n(CPCS) has asserted that it had no staff attorney in its public defender division, see G. L. c. 211D, § 6 (a),\navailable to represent any of the petitioners due to its own staffing and funding limitations, or due to the conflict of\ninterest that arises or may arise when attorneys from the same office also represent a codefendant or witness in\nthe case.\nOn May 6, 2004, CPCS filed in the county court a petition seeking relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, § 3, on behalf of\nNathaniel Lavallee and eighteen other indigent criminal defendants (Lavallee petitioners) being held in lieu of bail\nor under preventive detention, without counsel, by order of judges in the Springfield District Court. On the same\nday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (ACLU) filed a petition on behalf of Michael Carabello\nand four other indigent defendants, also being held without counsel by order of judges in the Holyoke District\nCourt. Both petitions were filed one day after judges in the Springfield and Holyoke District Courts had denied the\n\npetitioners' motions to compensate assigned counsel at a higher rate than the rates the Legislature has\n[6]\nauthorized CPCS to pay.\n231 The petitioners allege that, as a result of the Commonwealth's *231 chronic underfunding of the assigned counsel\nsystem administered by CPCS, there was no longer a sufficient number of certified private attorneys (bar\n[7]\nadvocates) willing to accept assignment in the petitioners' cases.  The petitioners sought a ruling that the failure\nof the Commonwealth to provide counsel to the petitioners warranted the exercise of this court's statutory or\ninherent powers of superintendence, and a declaration that the trial judges could order that assigned counsel be\ncompensated at a higher rate. The rate they requested was sixty dollars an hour for District Court cases, ninety\ndollars an hour for cases \"not within the final jurisdiction of the District Court,\" and one hundred twenty dollars an\nhour for murder cases. These proposed compensation rates are identical to those approved by CPCS in 2002,\npursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 211D, § 11, to \"establish rates of compensation payable, subject to\n[8]\nappropriation, to all counsel who are appointed or assigned to represent indigents\" (emphasis added).  In the\nalternative, the petitioners asked this court to determine a fair rate of compensation for assigned counsel, and to\ndirect CPCS to begin paying private assigned counsel according to that rate or rates.\nA single justice held a hearing on the petitions on May 6, 2004. Eleven days later the office of the Attorney\nGeneral moved on behalf of the respondents (Justices of the Springfield and Holyoke District Courts) to dismiss\nthe petitions. On May 20, the petitioners filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, and further moved for\nimmediate relief for those petitioners who had been detained without counsel for more than two weeks. On May\n21, the Lavallee petitioners moved to amend the petition to add thirty-three more unrepresented indigent\ndefendants in Hampden County as petitioners, and to name the Justices of additional Hampden County courts as\n232 respondents. The single justice allowed the motion to amend on May 25. He *232 consolidated the two cases\nand reserved and reported them without decision to the full court.\nWe conclude that the petitioners are being deprived of their right to counsel under art. 12 of the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights, a deprivation that has resulted in severe restrictions on their liberty and other constitutional\ninterests. Although we do not grant the precise remedy the petitioners seek for the reasons we shall explain, we\nhold that, on a showing that no counsel is available to represent a particular indigent defendant despite good faith\nefforts, such a defendant may not be held more than seven days and the criminal case against such a defendant\nmay not continue beyond forty-five days.\n1. Factual background. Hampden County Bar Advocates, Inc., contracts with CPCS to provide counsel for\nindigent defendants in Hampden County in cases that CPCS staff attorneys are unable to accept. See G. L. c.\n211D, § 6 (b). According to the petitioners, about fifty lawyers have left the Hampden County bar advocate\nprogram in the last several years because they are simply unable to make a living at the current compensation\n[9]\nrates.  Many others in the program have reduced their days of availability due to the increased number of cases\nassigned, brought about as a result of both the increase in the number of criminal cases and the reduction in the\nnumber of attorneys available to take assigned cases. On May 3 and 4, 2004, no Hampden County bar\nadvocates appeared in Springfield District Court, the busiest District Court in the Commonwealth, to accept\nassignments. As a result, many indigent defendants, including the nineteen original Lavallee petitioners, were\narraigned on those two days without benefit of counsel. A judge set bail or issued an order of preventive\n[10]\ndetention for each unrepresented petitioner.\nOn May 4, the presiding judge assigned the chief counsel for CPCS, William J. Leahy, to represent the Lavallee\n233 petitioners, *233 pursuant to G. L. c. 211D, § 5, and S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993).[11]\nLeahy, who was not present at the time, received the notices of assignment on the afternoon of May 4, and\nappeared in Springfield District Court the next morning (May 5). He informed the judge he was not there to\nrepresent the nineteen individual defendants, but rather to file and argue, collectively, motions to assign certified\nprivate counsel at rates exceeding those approved by the Legislature. The judge denied the motions, ruling that\nhe would \"continue with the order appointing CPCS,\" as he believed G. L. c. 211D required. Leahy's objections\nwere noted.\n\nAs for the second petition, Michael Carabello was charged in Holyoke District Court on April 2, 2004, with, inter\nalia, armed assault within a dwelling and kidnapping. An attorney assisted him for the purpose of \"bail only,\" but\nwould not represent him thereafter. Bail was set at $100,000 cash or $500,000 surety. As of July 8, Carabello\n[12]\nremained in custody without counsel and had not had a bail review in the Superior Court.\n2. Discussion. \"The discretionary power of review under G. L. c. 211, § 3, is recognized as `extraordinary,' and\nwill be available only in `the most exceptional circumstances.' Costarelli v. Commonwealth, 374 Mass. 677, 679\n(1978).\" Hagen v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 374, 377 (2002). Petitioners seeking relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3,\nmust present a substantial claim involving important substantive rights, and demonstrate that any error cannot\nadequately be remedied in the course of trial or normal appellate review. See Elder v. Commonwealth, 385 Mass.\n128, 132 (1982); Powers v. Commonwealth, 426 Mass. 534, 535 (1998).\nA. Right to counsel at bail and preventive detention hearings. Several petitioners allege, and it is not disputed,\n234 that they have *234 been ordered held in lieu of bail, or pursuant to an order of preventive detention, without the\nassistance of counsel. Because a defendant's liberty, a fundamental right, is at stake at a bail hearing, the\nprinciples of procedural due process in art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights are implicated. They\ninclude the right to be heard, which necessarily includes the right to be heard by counsel. See Commonwealth v. \nTorres, 441 Mass. 499, 501-502 (2004). A defendant is entitled to no less protection when the State seeks to\ndeprive him of his liberty under the preventive detention provision of G. L. c. 276, § 58A, on the ground that he is\ndangerous. Section 58A (4) specifically includes a right to counsel. Neither a bail hearing nor a preventive\ndetention hearing may proceed unless and until the defendant is represented by counsel.\nB. Right to counsel at trial. The Attorney General, on behalf of the respondents, argues that because CPCS has\nbeen appointed to represent the petitioners, there has been no denial of the right to counsel. The petitioners, on\nthe other hand, contend that \"[t]his argument badly confuses the designation of a case to CPCS for the purpose\nof assignment of counsel with the actual assignment of an individual attorney to represent each petitioner.\" They\nassert that the Commonwealth's failure to ensure that competent counsel is appointed at a defendant's first\nappearance, or promptly thereafter, irreparably damages the petitioners' substantive right to the assistance of\ncounsel.\nThere is no question that the right to counsel in a criminal prosecution is a fundamental constitutional right, see \nCommonwealth v. Appleby, 389 Mass. 359, 366, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 941 (1983), or that it is a substantive right\nfor purposes of jurisdiction under G. L. c. 211, § 3. Furthermore, the right to counsel under art. 12 provides a\ndefendant with at least the same safeguards as the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See \nCommonwealth v. Fuller, 394 Mass. 251, 256 n.3 (1985); Commonwealth v. Hodge, 386 Mass. 165, 169-170\n(1982) (because art. 12 does not require defendant to prove actual prejudice once he has shown that counsel\nwas burdened by actual conflict of interest, it provides greater safeguards than Sixth Amendment).\n235 The right to trial counsel under art. 12 attaches at least by the *235 time of arraignment, Commonwealth v. \nPatterson, 432 Mass. 767, 776 n. 10 (2000), or the point at which \"the government has committed itself to\nprosecute\" and \"a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed\nin the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.\" Commonwealth v. Simmonds, 386 Mass. 234,\n237-238 (1982), quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689 (1972). The right to counsel extends to \"every `critical\nstage' of the criminal process.\" Commonwealth v. Trapp, 423 Mass. 356, 358, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996).\n[13]\nThis constitutional guarantee of the assistance of counsel \"cannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.\" \nAvery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940). \"An accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney, whether\nretained or appointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668, 685 (1984). The right to counsel means the right to effective assistance of counsel. See Kimmelman v. \nMorrison, 477 U.S. 365, 377 (1986).\nThere are myriad responsibilities that counsel may be required to undertake that must be completed long before\ntrial if the defendant is to benefit meaningfully from his right to counsel under art. 12. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\nRoberio, 428 Mass. 278 (1998), S.C., 440 Mass. 245 (2003). These duties include interviewing the defendant\n\nand witnesses while events are fresh in their memories, preserving physical evidence that may be important to\nthe defense, and locating potential defense witnesses. The effects of the passage of time on memory or the\npreservation of physical evidence are so familiar that the importance of prompt pretrial preparation cannot be\noverstated.\nThe right to counsel also includes assistance in making decisions about specific defenses and trial strategies,\nwhich may rise to the level of \"critical stage\" of the process. For example, \"the decision to undergo a psychiatric\n236 evaluation is a critical stage.\" Commonwealth v. Trapp, supra at 359. Moreover, the *236 failure of counsel to\ninvestigate the possibility of an insanity defense where \"facts known to, or accessible to, trial counsel raised a\nreasonable doubt as to the defendant's mental condition\" constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. \nCommonwealth v. Roberio, supra at 280, quoting Commonwealth v. Doucette, 391 Mass. 443, 458-459 (1984).\nCritical stage opportunities may pass without a defendant's knowledge, and even if they can be revisited, the\nopportunity to develop them as fully had counsel been available may be impaired.\nOur Rules of Criminal Procedure acknowledge the importance of prompt pretrial preparation to the fairness of\ncriminal proceedings. They provide for mandatory discovery in all jury sessions, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 14, 378\nMass. 874 (1979); a pretrial conference report that must be filed within twenty-one days of arraignment, see\nMass. R. Crim. P. 11 (a) (1) (A), 378 Mass. 862 (1979); and a pretrial motion procedure that must be engaged\nwithin seven days of the filing of the pretrial conference report. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (d) (2) (A), 378 Mass.\n871 (1979). Cases that are handled in nonjury sessions of the District and Boston Municipal Courts follow similar\nrules, but under slightly more flexible time constraints. See Dist./Mun. Ct. R. Crim. P. 3(c), 4, 5, 6 (2004). The\npurpose of these rules is \"to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be\nconstrued to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of expense and delay.\"\nMass. R. Crim. P. 2, 378 Mass. 844 (1979). The petitioners, however, are not receiving the benefit of prompt\ndiscovery and preparation contemplated by the rules.\nIn view of the importance of prompt pretrial investigation and preparation, and the serious likelihood that without\nthe assistance of counsel, decisions that are themselves critical stages are not being made, the petitioners\ncurrently are being deprived of counsel to an extent that raises serious concerns about whether they will\nultimately receive the effective assistance of trial counsel. This is especially true for petitioners held in lieu of bail\nor under an order of preventive detention, who are virtually powerless to obtain a lawyer on their own or to begin\nworking on their own defense. The harm from inaction over a period of time is cumulative. It is for precisely these\n237 reasons *237 that Mass. R. Crim. P. 7 (b), (c), 378 Mass. 855 (1979), requires an appearance of counsel to be\nfiled at the arraignment, with certain limited exceptions. Although CPCS has been assigned to these cases, no\ncounsel has filed an appearance, except as noted in some cases solely for purposes of a hearing on bail or\npreventive detention. For all of these reasons, we have no difficulty concluding that the petitioners' constitutional\nright to the assistance of counsel is not being honored.\nThe Attorney General claims that the petitioners are not entitled to relief because there has been no specific\nshowing of harm. Although the petitioners have not yet claimed that they have been deprived of counsel at a\n[14]\ncritical stage of the proceedings,  we have said that the burden is on the Commonwealth to show that the lack\nof counsel at arraignment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Delle Chiaie v. Commonwealth, 367\nMass. 527, 531 (1975). This issue usually arises after trial, when a defendant has come forward with some\nspecific evidence of harm. The difficulty here is that, without counsel, there is no way for the Commonwealth or\nthe court to know what that harm is. We cannot properly rely on the petitioners themselves to assess the\nseriousness of any harm. An unrepresented criminal defendant cannot be expected \"to navigate the complex\ncriminal justice system.\" Commonwealth v. Lasher, 428 Mass. 202, 206 (1998). Similarly, it is not appropriate to\ninfer from a petitioner's silence that there is no harm. The Supreme Court said in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45,\n69 (1932), that an unrepresented defendant \"lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his\ndefense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\nproceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does\nnot know how to establish his innocence.\" We need not wait for counsel's presence or the articulation of a\nspecific harm before we may remedy the ongoing denial of counsel in the early stages of a case.\n\n238 Moreover, because they are unrepresented, there is no requirement *238 that the petitioners demonstrate the\ndegree of harm that is required to prevail on a motion for a new trial. See Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass.\n89, 96 (1974) (showing of \"serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel 00 behavior of counsel\n97\nfalling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer 00 and, if that is found,\n97\nthen, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of\ndefence\"). Because the petitioners are seeking redress for the ongoing violation of their fundamental\nconstitutional right that affects the manner in which the criminal case against them will be prosecuted and\ndefended, it is enough that they have shown a violation of that right that may likely result in irremediable harm if\nnot corrected. See Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 957 (1990)\n(prospective protection of constitutional right to counsel is available \"even if the violation of [that] right[] would not\naffect the outcome of a trial\"). The absence of counsel for pretrial preparation \"puts at risk both the defendant's\nright to an `ample opportunity to meet the case of the prosecution,' [Strickland v. Washington, supra at 685,\nquoting Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 275 (1942)], and the reliability of the adversarial\ntesting process. See [Strickland v. Washington, supra] at 688.\" Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 385 (1986)\n. Each petitioner has gone without counsel for a sufficiently long period of time to warrant our intervention in the\ninterests of justice.\nC. Available remedies. The Attorney General contends that because there are adequate remedies available,\nrelief under G. L. c. 211, § 3, should be denied. He first describes certain \"administrative remedies\" within CPCS,\nincluding (1) assignment of lawyers from the public defender division of CPCS; (2) reaching out to the private bar\nto increase the pool of available attorneys; and (3) appointment of private attorneys by CPCS on a case-by-case\nbasis. The \"relief\" described involves the internal management of CPCS and is not something that is available to\nthe petitioners under any administrative procedure. More importantly, it is not relief that any petitioner could have\n239 obtained \"in the normal course of trial and appeal,\" for purposes *239 of G. L. c. 211, § 3. Foley v. Lowell Div. of\nthe Dist. Court Dep't, 398 Mass. 800, 802 (1986).\nThe Attorney General next argues that there are available judicial remedies. He contends that we have the\ninherent authority to order members of the bar to undertake representation of indigent criminal defendants on a\npro bono basis. His reliance on Edgerly v. Commonwealth, 379 Mass. 183, 185-186 (1979), where the court cited\nAbodeely v. County of Worcester, 352 Mass. 719, 721-722 (1967), is misplaced. In the Abodeely case this court\nnoted that before the decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), the majority of States followed the\nrule here advanced. Abodeely v. County of Worcester, supra. The court also indicated that Massachusetts was\nno longer among them. See id. at 721-723. The court also indicated that the burden for shouldering the cost of\nindigent defense must fall on the community at large, as they are the intended beneficiaries of the police power\nunderlying the criminal justice system. Id. at 723. Counsel in both the Edgerly and Abodeely cases were in fact\ncompensated for their services. The import of those cases is not that appointed counsel should receive no\ncompensation at all, but that they are entitled to compensation at a rate more modest than can be expected in the\nmarketplace. This is because the work that is voluntarily undertaken by them is in the nature of \"public service,\"\nand because the source of compensation is a \"limited public treasury.\" Edgerly v. Commonwealth, supra at 186,\nciting Abodeely v. County of Worcester, supra at 724. We also intimated that the duty of the State to pay\ncompensation at this lower level was not a license to take unfair advantage of the private bar, but that appointed\ncounsel should be compensated at a level that had some rational relation to the level of compensation paid to\nattorneys in the public defender division of CPCS. See Edgerly v. Commonwealth, supra at 186.\nThe Attorney General cites the authority of judges under G. L. c. 211D, § 2A (counsel need not be appointed\nwhere defendant charged with misdemeanor if judge announces at arraignment that defendant will not be\nsentenced to period of incarceration), and the authority of district attorneys under G. L. c. 277, § 70C (certain\n240 minor offenses may be prosecuted as civil infractions), as available remedies that would cure the *240 problem of\nthe shortage of available attorneys. These procedures are well known to judges and district attorneys and may be\nutilized without the need for a defense motion. We can assume that the judges involved, as well as the district\nattorney, gave consideration to those measures and decided, in their sole discretion, not to employ them. The\ndiscretion of the district attorney to charge certain offenses as civil infractions is an exclusively executive\nprerogative, and a judge's discretion with respect to sentencing should be based on the customary factors\ngoverning disposition, not on the difficulties of securing counsel for the defendant.\n\nThere is no merit to the further suggestion that an available remedy lies in contempt proceedings that could be\nbrought against CPCS. While contempt may be an appropriate remedy in certain circumstances, there is no\nindication that it is warranted here. If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a judge's assignment order\nis being disregarded, he may seek appropriate relief, including contempt. The duty to provide counsel to indigent\ncriminal defendants belongs to the State, and the State is in the best position to enforce that duty. We cannot\nreasonably or rightfully expect an uncounselled defendant to seek enforcement of this duty, especially where the\nproblem is not attributable to him.\nFinally, the Attorney General contends that \"failing all else. . . CPCS should move in the lower court for relief,\nsuch as continuances, or the suppression of an uncounselled lineup identification, or even dismissal in an\nextreme case.\" This would be an eminently reasonable solution except for the fact that CPCS says it does not\nhave any attorneys available to represent petitioners in the manner suggested. The petitioners cannot be\nrequired to wait on their right to counsel while the State solves its administrative problems.\nThe harm involved here, the absence of counsel, cannot be remedied in the normal course of trial and appeal\nbecause an essential component of the \"normal course,\" the assistance of counsel, is precisely what is missing\nhere. The course of the proceedings in these cases is per se not normal. Although the harm may not be fully\n241 developed 00 a matter that can be ascertained at some later date after a petitioner has counsel 00 *241 the harm\n97 97\nnevertheless exists; the loss of opportunity to confer with counsel to prepare a defense is one that cannot be\nadequately addressed on appeal after an uncounselled conviction. Cf. Costarelli v. Commonwealth, 374 Mass.\n677, 679 (1978) (refusal to review pretrial double jeopardy claim would result in irremediable denial of\nconstitutional right). We cannot countenance allowing a criminal prosecution to proceed against a defendant who\ndoes not have the benefit of counsel up to and including a trial on criminal charges for which he could face\n[15]\nincarceration.  We therefore conclude that the petitioners have established a case for relief under G. L. c. 211,\n§ 3.\n3. Relief. The petitioners urge us to exercise our inherent powers and order judges to authorize compensation\nrates in excess of what the Legislature has appropriated. They rely primarily on O'Coins, Inc. v. Treasurer of the\nCounty of Worcester, 362 Mass. 507, 509-510 (1972) (relying on arts. 30, 29, and 11 of Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights). \"The power to direct the spending of State funds is a quintessential prerogative of the\nLegislature.\" County of Barnstable v. Commonwealth, 422 Mass. 33, 45 (1996), citing County of Barnstable v. \nCommonwealth, 410 Mass. 326, 329 (1991). See art. 30 (\"the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and\nexecutive powers, or either of them\"). However, \"among the inherent powers possessed by every judge is the\npower to protect his court from impairment resulting from inadequate facilities or a lack of supplies or supporting\npersonnel. To correct such an impairment, a judge may, even in the absence of a clearly applicable statute,\nobtain the required goods or services by appropriate means, including arranging himself for their purchase and\nordering the responsible executive official to make payment.\" O'Coin's, Inc. v. Treasurer of the County of\n242 Worcester, supra at 510. We note *242 that there is at present no claim here that the courts are unable to\nadjudicate cases due to \"inadequate facilities or a lack of supplies or supporting personnel.\" Id.\nBut the experience of other courts that have considered questions similar to those presented in this case, lack of\ncounsel or the inadequate compensation of counsel, is instructive. Concluding that the inadequate compensation\nof counsel amounts to the deprivation of the constitutional rights of the criminal defendants represented by\ninadequately compensated counsel, yet recognizing that appropriating funds is a legislative matter, several State\ncourts have temporarily deferred in the first instance, and only temporarily, to legislative action to ensure that the\nsystem for compensation for indigent representation meets constitutional standards. See, e.g., State ex rel.\nStephan v. Smith, 242 Kan. 336, 383 (1987) (unconstitutional system of compensation to be remedied by\nlegislative and administrative action); State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780, 791 (La. 1993) (court will only exercise\ninherent power and supervisory jurisdiction if Legislature fails to act); Smith v. State, 118 N.H. 764, 771 (1978)\n(\"adequate [legislative] appropriations will have to be made in order to comply with this ruling and to ensure the\ncontinued functioning of the criminal justice system\").\nIn other circumstances State courts of last resort have granted preliminary relief in the form of increased\ncompensation rates, but have simultaneously directed their Legislatures to amend permanently the compensation\n\nrates for indigent representation. See, e.g., State ex rel. Wolff v. Ruddy, 617 S.W.2d 64, 67-68 (Mo. 1981), cert.\ndenied, 454 U.S. 1142 (1982) (court established temporary guidelines pending solution); State v. Lynch, 796 P.2d\n1150, 1164 (Okla. 1990) (guidelines set by court effective until Legislature acts). A New York trial court recently\nissued a permanent injunction directing that counsel be paid ninety dollars per hour, and removed the statutory\nfee cap until the Legislature changed the rates and increased its appropriation for compensation for indigent\nrepresentation. See New York County Lawyers' Ass'n v. State, 196 Misc. 2d 761, 778 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2003).\nThe Attorney General argues that the Legislature has increased the CPCS appropriation for FY 2005, and that\n243 we *243 should take no action in view of the Legislature's response. While the FY 2005 budget increases the\ntotal CPCS (public defender division) staff and operations appropriation by $1,201,260, to $16,676,269 from a\nlevel of $15,475,009 in FY 2004, much of this increase is earmarked for specific projects, making it all but\nunavailable for the hiring of new CPCS staff attorneys. Specifically, using the increased funding, CPCS is\nrequired by the Legislature to establish a staff office to handle sexually dangerous person commitment hearings\nand trials (at an estimated cost of $344,100) and to meet \"critical non-personnel operational expenses\" (at an\nestimated cost of $200,000). Moreover, while the FY 2005 appropriation for CPCS staff and operations exceeds\nthe FY 2004 appropriation, it remains significantly below the amounts appropriated for FY 2002 ($17,017,460)\nand FY 2001 ($17,355,107), and this at a time when the number of criminal defendants requiring assigned\ncounsel has increased. In sum, the FY 2005 staff and operations appropriation, while an increase over the FY\n2004 amount, will permit the hiring of only a few additional full-time CPCS attorneys.\nNor can the arrival of additional staff attorneys at CPCS ameliorate the problem entirely. Where there are\nconflicts of interest stemming from representation of a codefendant or a witness, a CPCS staff attorney may not\nrepresent a defendant. Private counsel may therefore be needed, but the Legislature has not increased the\nhourly rate of compensation for attorneys in the private defender division for FY 2005, and there is no indication\nthat the availability of private defenders in Hampden County will improve.\nHowever, the decision by the Legislature to move away from the privatization of indigent defense services in\nfavor of augmenting the public counsel division is one that is properly and plainly within its prerogative, and we\naccord great respect to the Legislature's recent efforts to address the provision of counsel for indigent\ndefendants. The Legislature is keenly aware of the defendants' constitutional right to counsel, and of the\ndemands that right makes on the public treasury. As the representative branch in charge of making laws and\n244 appropriating funds, it will no doubt continue to exercise prudence and *244 flexibility in choosing among\ncompeting policy options to address the rights of indigent defendants to counsel. \"A spirit of mutual cooperation\namong the legislative, executive, and judicial departments is unquestionably the people's best guaranty of\nconstitutional government.\" O'Coin's, Inc. v. Treasurer of the County of Worcester, supra at 515. We urge such\ncooperation in fashioning a permanent remedy for what can now fairly be seen as a systemic problem of\nconstitutional dimension. In the meantime, however, while the constitutional rights of particular petitioners have\nnot yet been adequately addressed, our powers of general superintendence require us to fashion an appropriate\nremedy to the continuing constitutional violation suffered by indigent criminal defendants in the courts of\nHampden County.\nPotential remedies that are available and that have been discussed with the parties include the dismissal of\ncriminal charges and orders to stay criminal proceedings. In that regard, on July 2, 2004, we ordered the Attorney\nGeneral to appear before the single justice to explain (1) why any petitioner held in lieu of bail for more than\nseven days without counsel should not be ordered released from confinement forthwith; and (2) why, with respect\nto any petitioner facing a felony charge for more than thirty days without counsel, or a misdemeanor or municipal\nordinance violation charge for more than thirty days without counsel on which a judge has not declared, pursuant\nto G. L. c. 211D, § 2A, an intention to impose no sentence of incarceration, an order should not issue dismissing\nall such charges without prejudice until counsel is made available to provide representation to that petitioner.\nBecause neither the district attorney for Hampden County nor the sheriff of Hampden County had been a party to\nthese proceedings, either before the single justice or the full court, we offered to them the opportunity to intervene\nas to the issue of remedy, and both have intervened as to that aspect of the case.\nThe district attorney has indicated that many of the petitioners have been charged with serious offenses. He\nasserts that the release of those petitioners who are held, and the dismissal without prejudice of cases against\n\n245 them after thirty days without counsel, would jeopardize the public safety. We fully appreciate *245 his concerns,\nand we share them. Ensuring the public's safety is of the first order of government, a duty underlying all\ngovernment action. All involved must seek to remedy the constitutional violations we address today without\nunduly increasing the risk to public safety. Public safety, however, comes with a cost. One of the components of\nthat cost is the level of compensation at which counsel for indigent defendants will provide the representation\nrequired by our Constitution. See, e.g., Smith v. State, 118 N.H. 764, 771 (1978). As previously noted, the level of\ncompensation paid to private counsel has barely changed over the last two decades, and is among the lowest in\nthe nation. It is driving lawyers away from enrollment in the private defender division of CPCS in Hampden\nCounty. The inadequacy of compensation for private attorneys who represent indigent criminal defendants has\npersisted for many years. The continuation of what is now an unconstitutional state of affairs cannot be tolerated.\nWe also recognize that an appropriate remedy cannot and should not be implemented overnight. Our decision\ntoday allows time for the legislative and the executive branches to devise a response to the right of indigent\ncriminal defendants to counsel that fully protects the public safety. Our holding also presumes that judges and\nprosecutors will continue to assess presumed threats to public safety on a careful, case-by-case basis. We are\nconfident that all branches will work diligently and cooperatively to implement our decision in a manner that\nsafeguards the public's interests.\nThe Attorney General and the district attorney ask that we take no action for sixty days, expecting the problem of\nthe shortage of attorneys to be resolved by the recent legislative measures to augment the staffing and scope of\nservices provided by the public defender division of CPCS in Hampden County, discussed above. We observe\nthat there is no assurance that these measures will solve the problem. Moreover, these measures have not yet\nresulted in relief for the petitioners presently before this court. In response to this lawsuit and following our offer to\npermit him to intervene concerning remedies, the district attorney has undertaken administrative changes in his\n246 office to expedite the flow of \"bind-over\" cases into the *246 Superior Court. We laud the district attorney's\ninitiatives and his ready accession to the mandates of art. 12. But we do not know if even the implementation of\nthese measures will result in counsel to represent every indigent defendant in the Superior Court. Moreover, the\ndistrict attorney's efforts would not be able to address the problem of the lack of lawyers for cases that remain in\nthe District Court, where defendants continue to be arraigned and no counsel, public or private, is available to\nrepresent them.\nWe therefore must address the ongoing harm to indigent criminal defendants who are still deprived of counsel.\nThe duty to provide such counsel falls squarely on government, and the burden of a systemic lapse is not to be\nborne by defendants. Our duty is to remedy an ongoing violation of a fundamental constitutional right to counsel\nconsistently with the government's legitimate right to protect the public's safety. After hearing from the parties, the\ndistrict attorney, and the sheriff, we conclude that no defendant entitled to court-appointed counsel may be\nrequired to wait more than forty-five days for counsel to file an appearance, a period of time that approximates\nthe outer limits contemplated by the rules of criminal procedure for the completion of discovery and making\ndecisions about specific defenses in routine cases where counsel is actively involved. Proceedings in which a\ndefendant cannot participate meaningfully may not be allowed to proceed. If, despite good faith efforts by CPCS,\nno attorney has filed an appearance on behalf of an indigent defendant within forty-five days of arraignment, the\ncriminal case against such defendant must be dismissed without prejudice. Cf. Commonwealth v. Manning, 373\nMass. 438, 439 (1977) (deeming dismissal of indictment with prejudice to be appropriate remedy for wilful\ninterference with defendant's right to counsel). Similarly, an indigent defendant who is held in lieu of bail or under\n[16]\nan order of preventive detention may not be held for more than seven days without counsel.  Ordering such\n247 relief recognizes the public's strong interest in bringing serious criminals to justice swiftly, but it also recognizes \n*247 society's vital interest in the fair conduct of criminal proceedings. The resources that are available on any\ngiven day in a particular court must be prioritized and deployed in a manner that provides optimal protection to\nthe public.\nA system to implement the above remedy in an effective and efficient manner must now be devised, as to the\npresent petitioners, other indigent defendants with criminal cases pending in Hampden County, and future\nindigent defendants in Hampden County. We outline such a system below, but will remand to the single justice\nthe task of refining that system, or modifying it, after consultation with those who will be affected by this system:\nthe district attorney for Hampden County or his designee, the Chief Justice for Administration and Management\n\nor his designee, the Regional Administrative Justice of the Superior Court for the western region (Superior Court\nRAJ) or his designee, the Regional Administrative Justice of the District Court for region 5 (District Court RAJ) or\nhis designee, the Attorney General or his designee, the sheriff of Hampden County or his designee, the clerk of\nthe Hampden Superior Court or her designee, a clerk-magistrate from Hampden County designated by the\nDistrict Court RAJ (who shall represent and may consult with the clerk-magistrates of the District Courts of\nHampden County), chief counsel for CPCS or his designee, counsel for the petitioners, and such others as the\nsingle justice may designate.\nThe clerk-magistrate of each District Court in Hampden County, and the clerk-magistrate of the Hampden\nSuperior Court shall, on a weekly basis, prepare a list of all unrepresented criminal defendants facing charges in\ntheir respective courts and shall forward that list to the Superior Court RAJ, the District Court RAJ, the district\nattorney, the Attorney General, and chief counsel for CPCS. Such list shall contain the name of each defendant;\nthe pending charges and docket numbers; the date of arraignment; the defendant's bail status; and whether the\ndefendant is being held under an order of preventive detention. If there are no such unrepresented defendants,\nthe clerk-magistrate's report shall so indicate.\nOn receipt of that list each week, the Superior Court RAJ shall schedule a prompt status hearing with respect to\n248 each *248 defendant who has been held for more than seven days, or each defendant whose case has been\n[17]\npending for more than forty-five days.  If, as of the time of that hearing, any defendant on that list is still\nunrepresented by counsel, the Superior Court RAJ shall determine whether CPCS has made a good faith effort\n[18]\nto secure representation for each such defendant.  If the Superior Court RAJ determines that, despite good\nfaith efforts of CPCS and any efforts by others to secure representation for any such defendant, there is still no\ncounsel willing and available to represent a defendant, then the Superior Court RAJ must order the following: (1)\nwith respect to any defendant who has been held in lieu of bail or pursuant to an order of preventive detention for\nmore than seven days, the Superior Court RAJ shall order that the defendant be released on personal\nrecognizance and may, in view of the emergency nature of this remedy, treat this as an exception to \nCommonwealth v. Dodge, 428 Mass. 860, 864-866 (1999), and impose probationary conditions pursuant to G. L.\nc. 276, § 87, without the defendant's consent; (2) with respect to any defendant who has been facing a felony\ncharge for more than forty-five days without counsel, or a misdemeanor or municipal ordinance violation charge\nfor more than forty-five days without counsel on which a judge has not declared, pursuant to G. L. c. 211D, § 2A,\nan intention to impose no sentence of incarceration, the Superior Court RAJ shall order that the charge or\n249 charges be dismissed without *249 prejudice until such time as counsel is made available to provide\nrepresentation to that defendant.\nWe intend that these procedures be implemented in a manner that provides prompt relief to those defendants\nwhose right to counsel is being violated, and sets a clear deadline by which counsel must be secured in order to\nproceed with the case or continue to hold a defendant. That deadline provides certainty to the defendants who\nare suffering a violation of their rights, and also provides all concerned with an opportunity of known duration to\nmake all reasonable efforts to cure this violation in the most direct and effective way, i.e., to secure counsel for\nthe defendant. We also intend that these procedures be adapted to permit an efficient, effective means of\nachieving those goals, without unnecessary burden on any participant in this process. To that end, as indicated\nabove, we remand this matter to the single justice, who is given authority to modify the mechanism by which the\nforty-five and seven-day deadlines may be enforced in the courts of Hampden County, and who is to confer with\nthe above identified participants with respect to appropriate modifications of that mechanism.\nSo ordered.\n[1] Several named indigent pretrial detainees, other unknown indigent criminal defendants, and the Committee for\nPublic Counsel Services (CPCS) on behalf of future defendants.\n[2] The Justices of the Springfield, Chicopee, Palmer, Westfield, and Holyoke Divisions of the District Court\nDepartment. Motions to intervene, filed by the district attorney for Hampden County and the sheriff of Hampden\nCounty, were allowed by a single justice of this court.\n[3] Michael Carabello & others vs. Justices of the Holyoke District Court Department & others.\n\n[4] We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the Massachusetts Bar Association and Hampden County Bar\nAssociation; the Boston Bar Association, the Bristol County Bar Association; the Bristol County Bar Advocates;\nthe Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; William C. Flanagan and Edward J. Barshak; and\nArnold R. Rosenfeld.\n[5] Statute 2003, c. 26, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX, and appropriation acts for fiscal years going back to FY 1999\nrefer generally to the hourly rates as those that were paid in the prior fiscal year. The appropriations act for FY\n1998 specifically refers to the hourly rates described in the text. See St. 2002, c. 184, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX;\nSt. 2001, c. 177, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX; St. 2000, c. 159, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX; St. 1999, c. 127, § 2,\nline item XXXX-XXXX; St. 1998, c. 194, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX; St. 1997, c. 43, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX.\n[6] The Springfield District Court judge denied the petitioners' motion on the ground that under the provisions of\nG. L. c. 211D and under the Supreme Judicial Court Rules, when there are no \"competent attorneys willing or\nable to be appointed, then the appointment rests on the shoulders of CPCS.\" The Holyoke District Court judge\ndenied the petitioners' motion after concluding that he had \"no authority to order any increase in the level of\ncompensation for appointed counsel.\"\n[7] Part of the problem, as William J. Leahy, chief counsel for CPCS, noted at the May 5, 2004, hearing in\nSpringfield District Court, is that \"Hampden County just doesn't have as many lawyers as most of the eastern part\nof the State does.\"\n[8] Historically, these rates have been rejected by the Legislature in its general appropriation acts, pursuant to G.\nL. c. 211D, § 11. Instead, the Legislature has specified the rates to be paid, and has not appropriated funds to\npay the rates \"establish[ed]\" by CPCS. See, e.g., St. 2003, c. 26, § 2, line item XXXX-XXXX; St. 2004, c. 149, §\n2, line item XXXX-XXXX.\n[9] Private counsel are responsible for their own office expenses (e.g., rent, equipment, telephone, library, and\nsupport services), as well as professional malpractice insurance, health insurance, and the employer's share of\nsocial security payments.\n[10] According to Leahy, as of July 8, 2004, fifty-eight indigent defendants with cases pending in Hampden\nCounty were without counsel to represent them; thirty-one were held in custody.\n[11] General Laws c. 211D, § 5, provides: \"A justice or associate justice shall assign a case to [CPCS]\" after\nreceiving a report from the probation officer as to a defendant's ability to pay for counsel. Similarly, S.J.C. Rule\n3:10, § 5, as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993), provides that on a finding of indigency, \"the judge shall assign\n[CPCS] to provide representation for the party.\"\n[12] Subsequently, on July 8, 2004, through the intervention of the district attorney for Hampden County in\nresponse to this lawsuit, Carabello was indicted and arraigned in the Superior Court, and a CPCS attorney has\nfiled an appearance on his behalf.\n[13] Critical stages of the proceedings include the probable cause hearing, see Commonwealth v. Donovan, 392\nMass. 647, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1038 (1984); a postindictment lineup, see Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263\n(1967); the trial, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342-344 (1963); and sentencing, see Osborne v. \nCommonwealth, 378 Mass. 104 (1979).\n[14] Generally, arraignment itself is not a critical stage of criminal proceedings in Massachusetts. See Chin Kee v.\nCommonwealth, 354 Mass. 156, 163-164 (1968).\n[15] An assistant attorney general, not counsel who has argued this appeal, acknowledged at a hearing on July 8,\n2004, before the single justice, that art. 12 might preclude trial of an unrepresented defendant who had not\nwaived the right to counsel. An unrepresented defendant who has not waived counsel and whose case is not\ntried within the time (one year) prescribed by Mass. R. Crim. P. 36, as amended, 428 Mass. 202 (1998), is\nentitled to dismissal. See Commonwealth v. Lasher, 428 Mass. 202 (1998). In contrast, an unrepresented\ndefendant who is tried in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel may not be sentenced to incarceration,\nor, in the alternative, he is entitled to a new trial. See Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002).\n\n[16] We believe this remedy also adequately addresses the rights of those defendants who were unrepresented\nat the time bail was set or preventive detention was ordered.\n[17] The Superior Court RAJ for the western region will be designated a judge of the District Court Department for\npurposes of this procedure, pursuant to G. L. c. 211B, § 9. See Requests for Interdepartmental Assignments,\nTrial Court Rules (2004). His designation shall last for six months, and for such additional six-month periods as\nthe single justice may determine.\n[18] We expect that CPCS, pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 211D, § 6 (b), will take all reasonable\nmeasures to expand the list of attorneys available to accept assignments in criminal cases in Hampden County,\nwho are not members of Hampden County Bar Advocates, Inc. In addition, the Superior Court RAJ, with the\nassistance of the Regional Administrative Justice of the District Court for region 5, may pursue all reasonable\nmeans to develop his own list of qualified and available attorneys from which he may make assignments,\nconsistent with S.J.C. Rule 1:07, as amended, 431 Mass. 1301 (2000), whenever CPCS certifies that it has no\navailable attorney. Such attorneys shall be entitled to compensation from CPCS appropriated funds at the rates\napproved by the Legislature.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
