Plaintiffs were represented by a private law firm.  Upon filing the claim, a motion to certify the class was made. That motion was never decided upon.  </p><p>On November 1, 2004, the court (Greaney, J.) ordered a stay of the proceedings due to pending action by the legislature to increase counsel compensation rates.  The legislature substantially increased the pay rates for appointed counsel, and on October 30, 2007, the court dismissed the case on grounds of mootness.</p><p>We have no further information on this matter.</p><p></p>",
